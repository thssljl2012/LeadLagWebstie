We just got back from Chicago where we saw the Sticky &amp;amp; Sweet Madonna tour.&amp;nbsp; We went through ALOT to get there. Almost halfway to Chicago, a strange grinding sound was coming through the vents, I went to downshift only to find there was nothing when I pressed down on the clutch.&amp;nbsp; I got pulled over to the shoulder as quickly as I could and tried to figure out what was going on.&amp;nbsp; I wasn't sure what to do, and was certain we'd never make it, especially because I figured the truck would have to be towed and we'd have to find someone to come pick us up.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Times have been hard with the factory shutting down for a week here and there, so I really had no $$ to spare on this trip.&amp;nbsp; Already I was facing unexpected expenses. I started praying, asking God to send a state trooper to help us.&amp;nbsp; Moments later, I spotted a state trooper going the other way.&amp;nbsp; He turned around and pulled off behind us.&amp;nbsp; Not only did God answer the prayer, but he sent a CUTE trooper to help us.&amp;nbsp; He got on his radio and started looking for a tow truck and a place that would fix the truck and get us back on the road right away. Unfortunately, I wasn't more specific when I prayed, so the trooper wasn't finding someone that would fix the truck right away and get us back on the road.&amp;nbsp; During this time, Steve stretched his leg over to the driver's side and tried the clutch.&amp;nbsp; He felt something and told me.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I got in the truck and tried it... I found I could drive it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The trooper agreed to follow us for awhile to make sure we didn't get stranded again. At the next exit, I pulled off and called my dad and asked him if it was possible to just lose a gear.&amp;nbsp; He confirmed that it was.&amp;nbsp; Third and Fifth gears were a problem, and second gear was making a sound I didn't like, but fourth was just fine.&amp;nbsp; We decided to find a place to rent a car.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I was praying we'd find a place that would take cash, because all I have is a debit card, and I knew I didn't have enough funds to cover a rental on it.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We found an Enterprise that was on the way, so I called Bank of America to see if they would allow a charge to go through and explained the emergency.&amp;nbsp; The told me that judging from my account and relationship with the bank, they saw no problem with it. The guy at Enterprise was very friendly and cute.&amp;nbsp; And apparently,&amp;nbsp;a Madonna fan.&amp;nbsp; All they had were SUV's.&amp;nbsp; The most expensive rentals.&amp;nbsp; Not to mention I'm very anti-SUV.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; But there was no other option.&amp;nbsp; When Aaron (the cute Enterprise guy) swiped my card, I bit my lip, praying that it would, indeed go through.&amp;nbsp; It did.&amp;nbsp; (Incidentally, I highly recommend Bank of America because of the way they helped me out in this situation.&amp;nbsp; I guaruntee no other bank would have done so). Once we got our stuff transferred to the (gulp!) SUV, we were finally on our way again to the Windy City and Madonna! (to be continued)
