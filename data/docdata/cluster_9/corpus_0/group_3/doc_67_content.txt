i deposit a lot of checks, probably on a daily basis because of my pet sitting business.&amp;nbsp; bank of america's atms are all flashy with a color touch screen with ads for various bank products.&amp;nbsp; so every day when i roll up to that bitch... up pops the ad with the hip happy young couple smiling ear to ear and running on the beach with their dogs.&amp;nbsp; that picture pretty much sums up everything i want out of life and try so hard for,&amp;nbsp;but still&amp;nbsp;apparently am not meant to&amp;nbsp;have (good relationship, the chick is skinny, living near the beach, big smiley perma-grinned happiness, a guy that actually is happy just being out with&amp;nbsp;his girl&amp;nbsp;and the dogs instead of out running around with his jackass friends).&amp;nbsp; of all the ads they run, that is the one that always shows up when i'm in front of the damn machine.&amp;nbsp; so go ahead bank of america... rub that shit in my face DAILY.
