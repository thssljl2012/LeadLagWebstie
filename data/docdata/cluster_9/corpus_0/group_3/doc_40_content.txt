I live in a:&gt;:major shipping port, and fishing area.  I race sailboats, and I've won:&gt;:the most prestigious yacht race in this part of the country.:&gt;::&gt;:&gt;Yeah, but the pirates aren't operating from that sort of area and:&gt;they're not racing sailboats.::I know that.  But boats are NOT, "cheap and easily obtainable."  No:matter what kind of boat  you are talking about.:Of course they are, given what the pirates are using.:&gt;::&gt;:Sure you do.  I often go out and spend my loot and plunder to attack:&gt;:ships, instead of watching movies on my plasma TV.:&gt;::&gt;:&gt;So there must not be any pirates and there must never have been any.:&gt;No criminals, either.:&gt;:&gt;Amazing!  Who knew?::You don't waltz into a harbor, and say to a boat owner, "I'll trade:you a cask of rum for that boat, Arrrrr!"  "Oh.  Throw in an arsenal:of weapons and a stout and bold crew.":You really don't have a fucking clue about what conditions are like inAfrica, do you?::&gt;:&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I guess you consider that, "comparatively," cheap and easily obtained.:&gt;:&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;:&gt;:&gt;&gt;&gt;Certainly, I'm sorry if you couldn't invest a few thousand to:&gt;:&gt;&gt;&gt;make a few hundred thousand but most investors would call that:&gt;:&gt;&gt;&gt;"cheap".:&gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;:&gt;&gt;Risking your life is cheap?  Maybe for you.:&gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;:&gt;You hire people to do that.:&gt;::&gt;:Oh, I forgot.  Hiring people to risk life and limb are cheap, and:&gt;:easily obtainable.  Training them, and giving them weapons, too.:&gt;::&gt;:&gt;In many parts of Africa it certainly is both cheap and easy.  They:&gt;don't need a lot of training.:&gt;::You certainly don't know boating.  A lot of people I know blow chunks:when it gets over three foot waves.:These people are mostly ex-fishermen and you don't train awayseasickness.::&gt;::&gt;:I'd rather spend my money on hookers.:&gt;::&gt;:&gt;No doubt.  But you don't live in East Africa.::Does it look like it?:Well, given your lack of intellectual engagement I would suspect youmight be suffering from kwashkior...::&gt;:&gt;&gt;I just said what a zodiac was.  And I doubt that pirates have:&gt;:&gt;&gt;Mastercard.:&gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;:&gt;You're almost certainly wrong. (And astonishingly ignorant):&gt;::&gt;:Wrong?  That pirates have Mastercard?  Do they even have ID?:&gt;::&gt;:&gt;Cash trumps all.  Do you have ANY idea of how much of this kind of:&gt;equipment is available in Africa?::Why don't you tell me?:Give me the names and addresses of everybody in Africa who owns a:boat.:I don't have that kind of bandwidth.Hint:  Africa is awash in combat equipment and has been for the lasthalf century.::&gt;::&gt;:&gt;&gt;Not at all.  I won this debate.:&gt;:&gt;&gt;:&gt;:&gt;When Fred comes to my support, you can be very certain you've:&gt;:&gt;made a complete ass of yourself.:&gt;::&gt;:That's your opinion.  Keep it.:&gt;::&gt;:&gt;You haven't a clue.  Stick to hookers and dancers, because you don't:&gt;know shit about this topic.:&gt;::All I'm saying is that boats are not, "cheap and easily obtainable.":That's my point, and I'm sticking to it.:You do that.

That was my whole point.:You lost a "less than".  In East Africa, MUCH less than.  I can get anappropriate RHIB, better equipped than those in Africa, for around$40k.  That's the price in California, which has somewhat higherprices than East Africa.::Toss in the cost of the RPGs, other weapons, equipment, fuel, dockage,:crew, lunch, and rum, it all adds up.:One more time for Horvath, the slow of wit:1) RPGs are floating around all over Africa.  You can probably get onefor a couple of chickens.2) AK-47s are easier to come by than that.3) How much does 40 gallons of diesel cost?  Especially if you take itat gunpoint?4) Dockage isn't required.5) Crew work for shares, just like they did when they were fishermen.6) One of the reasons they're pirates is because it puts food on thetable.7) Rum is optional.Is it starting to sink in yet?-- "Ignorance is preferable to error, and he is less remote from the truth who believes nothing than he who believes what is wrong."                               -- Thomas Jefferson == 5 of 7 ==Date: Sun, Oct 5 2008 2:40pm From: "William Black"  "Fred J.
