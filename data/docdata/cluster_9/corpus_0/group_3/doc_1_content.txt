Akaelae, PURE and Alien Dice have updated!I'm reorganizing the updates so they will update on different days this week.  PURE is moving to Wednesday, Sivine Blades to Friday.  Everything else will remain the same.And for those who keep missing it.  Kim was sick last week and part of the week before = missed updates.Today's to be done: Inking, Scanning, Prep, ColoringColor 1 Abby Updates,  Sivine Blades, Shivae!  (I've got to trudge through coloring the last pages so I can get to the easier black and white pages. :D )Today's Done: Honestly ... I'd cancel my AIG insurance if I had one.  $440,000 spent by high level execs on a celebration when the government bailout passed.  I agree with Obama, they should have to pay that back to the government that wasted money.I'm now just going to say McCain so that my sites don't only run Obama ads... which means I have to say McCain again to make it equal. :D  Flu shot obtained... ouch... it's sore.  Good thing I got it in the left shoulder so I can work.  I did find out that my blood sugars actually WERE almost on target.  My excercising has been working, only .. all of a sudden .. I seem to be GAINING weight.  I suspect it might be the new excercises like ... Yoga poses.  I'm tempted to take a class.  Six minutes of standing poses has me sweating faster than 20 minutes of walking and I kind of like it.Now I wait and see if my blood sugars are on target.  If they're not, my doctor is going to be perscribing me a new medication which is a once a day injection (it helps lower blood sugars and lose weight).  The more I think about it... the more I kinda like the idea.  I like having a doctor who is trying new things.  To think I got him by accident when my usual doctor was out. :D  Either that or I think my old doctor was one of those who didn't really care to try new things, but just stick with the old.  I've been on Glyrubide for six years.
