ASB Bank Tennis CentreOur interclub team played last Sat so I thought I would take some pics of the team playing as it was at the ATP tennis centre.  So that was quite cool.  We won 5-1, I won both my singles and doubles.  Not hard.  I think we are at a low grade so we have done really well.Keegan hitting his forehand against the ginger ninjaGlendowie serves to Jonathan (our teammate)Keegan serves up some whup-ass
