I cba with a lot of effort this year so I thought I'd just go in my true form, the Autumnal faerie of win (see my Wikipage). However, because I've left all my best outfits in the other realm and His Majesty still hasn't give me my damn powers back*, I have to do it all manually. Like a human. Fuck sake. It's a good job I'm bored. So today the rockwanglers and I set off for Stoke Park Woods and collected some lovely deciduous leaves of varying colours, and I've just covered them all (and myself in the process) in lashings of PVA glue and what mortals use as a sad excuse for glitter. I do believe I'm gonna look fabulous. So, jareth_rex, stick that in your pipe and smoke it.* I've been getting the damn trash off the damn streets for fucken years and I think it's about time I got something back, goddamnit. I would just go and politely ask him for my life back but I think he's busy and I'm scared he'll throw me in the Bog. Which WOULD happen, without a doubt. I think we've already established that Gemsy + 2008 = BADTIMES.
