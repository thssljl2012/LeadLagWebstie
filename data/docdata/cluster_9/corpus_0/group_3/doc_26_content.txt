  shane &amp;amp; i had a lovely dinner at the ft. worth club on tuesday night.  we were there to celebrate our hero, rouel!  he was awarded the bank of america local hero award for ALL of his volunteer efforts to make azle a better place!!  i can promise you that azle became a better place when he and his family moved there in 1987!
