Ah, that's a sign.  It happened this morning, as I was preparing my outdoor wear for walking.  I also put on a scarf.  On the lawn of Sir Ewan's garden, leaves and fruit and rose petals have been blown onto the grass together, as if someone had thrown away a gigantic pot-pourri.I haven't been checking the Canadian news recently.  What with all the US and UK banks that are in financial trouble, what about the Royal Bank and the TD?  Are there any smaller banks that I might not know about?  All our money is with Lloyds TSB, and they must be okay because they've offered to take over Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS).But now I've had a quick read of the Vancouver Sun and the number of deaths from tasers is concerning me.  Maybe just as many people died when police just used guns, I don't know, and maybe it was so everyday that the papers didn't report it.  But I thought the point of tasers was to give the police a way to bring a suspect under control without killing him.  On a lighter note, I found a recipe I might try, for a pear and cream cheese crumble tart.  I just need some pears.http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=18e10670-b915-4dd9-a5eb-299b54ddecf4I'll let you know how it turns out.
