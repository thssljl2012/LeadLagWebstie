                   So I'm on hold with Bank of America tonight.  At minute 27, the message kinda changes and they say that my call will get all the attention it deserves when they (THEY) get back on the line.  I wait until minute 50 before hanging up thinking GODDAMN! BOA Customer Service really sucks.  I call back immediately thinking I got lost in the queue (you know, a programming bug or something) to find out, the office is closed and has been closed a whole 25 minutes.  WTF???  Were they going to keep on hold until they opened tomorrow morning.  I feel like such an idiot for not hanging up sooner.  I feel like hanging up my bank account, but unfortunately it wouldn't hurt them any ... they're BOA.
