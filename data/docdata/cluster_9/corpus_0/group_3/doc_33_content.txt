         I was standing in line for the Bank of America ATM in Columbia Heights (there's always a line...) when a deranged old white dude with a scraggly beard and gnarled teeth came and gave me a talking to.  I have no idea what he was saying, but it was not complimentary.After he'd gone, and I glanced toward the short, middle-aged black lady in front of me (she'd been waiting for my eyes), she let me know what was on her mind:"I hate to say it, but it's good to see a little diversity in the crazy people around here.  It sounds bad, but it's true.  This way it's mixed a little.  You know, mixed nuts."Ha!This one's for George:(Hat tip to SLNG)
