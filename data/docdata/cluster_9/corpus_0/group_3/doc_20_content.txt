Catching up on email today, I found one arranging for dinner with The Golf Channel at Marcello's in Ridgewood NJ (this all was while in NJ for the Barclays Golf Tournament).It caught my eye because it was a memorable evening with VERY memorable food.  I had one of the best steak dishes I'd ever had and I'd be remiss if I didn't post it in case any of you ever find yourself anywhere near Ridgewood, NJ.It was the "Marado" - Filet Mignon stuffed with smoked mozzarella, prosciuttoand spinach, portobello mushroom, port wine.  I am salivating just thinking of it.
