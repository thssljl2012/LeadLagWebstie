Wednesday 08- I got up early, fed the cat, and jumped in the Gross Polluter and headed to town.&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Just a note on yesterdays post: It occurred to me that my post about receiving $49 for that article Legend of the High Desert I wrote for the newspaper may have sounded like sarcasm. It was not! I was really thrilled to get paid for something that I love to do! And that something is to put words together in a meaningful way so that other folks may understand my stories.&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Todays Weather was: Temps of around 69 to 100, calm winds, humidity around 19 percent, clear skies. According to the National Weather Service   Thursday: Sunny, with a high near 87. West southwest wind 9 to 12 mph increasing to between 17 and 20 mph. Winds could gust as high as 26 mph. Thursday Night: Mostly clear, with a low around 59. West northwest wind around 17 mph, with gusts as high as 24 mph.  &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp My first stop was to fill up on gas. It was $3.29 at Arco and I spent $30 filling up my truck and a five-gallon container. Then onto Bank of America where I deposited some checks. I always take off my Angels cap and sunglasses when I go inside because I look too much like a bank robber and folks appear nervous around me. &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp WalMart was next and I went right in to get what I wanted and got out. Stater Brothers was a different story; they keep changing it around on me. My Brother says its a marketing ploy to get you to spend time looking around other places in the store, and possibly buying items you wouldnt otherwise purchase. Well I know what I want and seldom vary from my list. I used to be able to find it quickly and get out. I may do my shopping somewhere else if they change it on me again. By the way, they replaced my missing yogurt from my last trip there that they forgot to replace after the bag ripped and everything fell on the floor.&amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Home Depot was my last stop on my way home. That place is enormous and hunting down things there is worse than Staters. I dont like to spend too much time in there because when I walk down the aisles I can see all these items I need for my home; kind of like Staters marketing ploy but done in a different way. I was so frustrated going from one end of the store to the other that I caught myself talking to myself; Ill have to watch that being I dont get out much. I got my nails, paint, some lumber, and two 4x8 molded plastic lattices that Ill put up as wind blocks. &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Funny thing is that I ran into Lee and Marcie Hines at WalMart, Staters, and Home Depot. Marcie jokingly asked if I was following them around. &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Finally got home, unloaded and put everything away, and started to paint my patio. Spent two and a half hours in the heat of the day painting until the Sun started going down. Took a shower and went on my evening walk. &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp I was mighty tired after all this work; my whole body ached. I sat down to relax, called my brother Kevin, and yakked at him for fifty minutes. Then I watched Bones on Fox about a womans body that was found washed up on a beach. &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Did my stretches, practiced my guitar, wrote to my journal, posted it to the web, and called it a night. Im so tired that I think Ill sleep a sound sleep tonight.
