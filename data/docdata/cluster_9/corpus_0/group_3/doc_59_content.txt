Barclays finally sent me a new pin but with all the security features it pretty much unreadable. So I've ended up blocking my card because I entered a 3 insted of an 8. And so much for 3 chances before its blocked 2 of them were taken before they even told me it was the wrong pin!Parental womans asked me to put the beef in the oven as soon as I get home because I'm normally the first one. This is normally fine but I'm really behind with R.S work and would really rather be doing it now whilst I'm in the library instead of at home where I won't do anything. grrr
