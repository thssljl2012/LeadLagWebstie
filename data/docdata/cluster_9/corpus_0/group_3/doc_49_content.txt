Hey, guys and gals!   Pack extra suds into that cooler and a heavy load of chew when y'all head down to Lowes Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina for a Republican National Committee kick-off to Saturday night's NASCAR Bank of America 500: None other than Cindy McCain will attend the "Victory Rally and Cowboy Troy concert to show support for John McCain, Sarah Palin, and the entire Republican ticket." All the down-home fun starts at 3pm.   Judging by the crowds of real Americans which McCain and Palin have been drawing to their rallies lately, the race could be a mere sideshow to this "Victory 2008" rally.   (Yes, it's NASCAR Barbie!)  U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn (TN), Former Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer, NASCAR drivers Richard Petty and Richard Childress, Cowboy Troy, and John McCain's son, Doug McCain, will address grassroots volunteers, participate in voter-registration activities, and speak to voters.  The event also will feature a special announcement by Petty and Childress, who will unveil their endorsements of John McCain and Sarah Palin for president and vice president. Oh, be still my thumpin' heart.  (Family-friendly NASCAR welcomes hard liquor distillers as major sponsors; this fan shows his appreciation)  It all happens Saturday night at Lowes ... And don't ferget yer Jonny Reb flags, either! "Stars and Bars" forever!   Hmmm ... Maybe Mr. Sarah Palin will be there, too; if his wife lets him, that is. He can pick-up some pointers on seceding from the Union, as interested as he seems to be in such things ... We think it's real nice that he has such an interesting hobby. That boy's smart as a whip.                    More on Cars
