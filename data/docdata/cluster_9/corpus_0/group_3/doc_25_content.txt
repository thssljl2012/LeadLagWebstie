After literally hours upon hours of fighting with DirecTV we finally have service. Bastardos.But today at my adventure to bank of america to make my deposit i noticed this on the wall and said &amp;quot;I want a hello Kitty card&amp;quot; and the bank lady said &amp;quot;ok&amp;quot;. so i'm getting one in 5-7 business days to replace my boring old check card.YAY!!!
