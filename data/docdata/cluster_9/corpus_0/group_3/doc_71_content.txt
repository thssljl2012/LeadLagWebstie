A few notes from my walk around Cambridge today. The guy I know who runs a tiling warehouse store (I was his first customer 15 years ago) said the bottom just fell out of his market 3 weeks ago. He is a loyal Barclays customer with a 40K overdraft, without warning or for any reason they suddenly decided they want him to pay 11% for his overdraft! Impossible for him to change banks, the other banks are not taking on new business customers! The gym I joined , to get a decent clean swimming pool, gave me 15months membership for the price of 11 plus I got loads of visitor passes for Sally to use. The gym seemed very busy. The queues at the tills in White Stuff for their midseason sale where humungous and the shop was heaving. The outdoor shop Open Air was totally deserted&amp;#8230; The Apple store was packed, as usual. The streets were busy with the new students and it is a glorious autumnal day.
