Boy oh boy, have the Reds and Bank of America got a deal for you. If you are among those willing to wield a credit card emblazoned with Cincinnati graphics, they&amp;#8217;ll present you with your very own miniature base, autographed by Bronson Arroyo. Now, the credit card itself I can almost get behind. It can represent the emotional credit that you&amp;#8217;ve lent the team year after year, hoping it&amp;#8217;ll finally be enough to finance their never-ending rebuilding. Plus, you can buy stuff with it. The miniature base has its symbolism, too. It stands for all the bases Arroyo gave up this year. But once you&amp;#8217;re done reflecting on the highly anticipated one-two punch that failed to perform, then the squandering of the unexpected one-two punch delivered by a couple rookies, there doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be much to do with the thing. You can&amp;#8217;t even set them up in the living room and pretend you&amp;#8217;re a giant unless you open three different accounts.
