...people take what I say too seriously.FYI - what I say is rarely what I mean, if I'm joking, it's about the untrue, fact. If you take offence, it's because of your insecurities, not my words, and I cba picking up the pieces of everyone else's lives. I can laugh at myself, everyone else should laugh at themselves too ;-)Right now REALLY time for bed, ack tiredness!
