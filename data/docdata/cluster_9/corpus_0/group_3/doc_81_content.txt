Usually, mile and a hald tracks are benign creatures with multiple grooves and a lot of comfort zones for drivers to ride around in without fear of having to exert themsemselves.&amp;nbsp; Not here.&amp;nbsp; Lowe's is a miserable brute of a track, especially Turn 4 which loves nothing more than sending cars on a self-contained merry-go-round of the nasty kind which often take one or more fellow competitors along for the ride. Assuming the weather cooperates, tonight should be interesting.&amp;nbsp; It's almost easier to lose points than gain them here, so expect some pins and needles driving.&amp;nbsp; Look for the usual suspects to excel -- Jimmie Johnson, the house of Roush, and all the other colorful rogues we've all come to know and... know. FYI, I'll be at a friend's birthday party this afternoon and might not make it back in time for the start of the race.&amp;nbsp; I'll get here eventually.&amp;nbsp; In the meanwhile, chat it up.
