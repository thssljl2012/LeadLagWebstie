 This article got deleted from it's original web site at http://gizmodo.com/5058544/criminal-uses-craiglist-to-escape-from-armored-truck-robbery, so I'm re-posting it here.A bank robber got away with a bag full of mucho money from an armored truck after successfully pulling out a perfect escape plan, straight out the final scene of the Thomas Crown Affair. The criminal&amp;#8212;who was wearing a yellow vest, safety goggles, a respirator mask and a blue shirt&amp;#8212;used Craigslist to hire a dozen of decoys to confuse the police and the public around the scene. Mike, one of the hired decoys, gave the full details:    I came across the ad that was for a prevailing wage job for $28.50 an hour. He said to meet near the Bank of America in Monroe at 11 a.m. Tuesday. (He also was told to wear a yellow vest, safety goggles, a respirator mask&amp;#8230; and, if possible, a blue shirt).I know, stealing is bad, but I wish all crimes were as amusing and non-violent as this one.
