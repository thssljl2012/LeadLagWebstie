                    For those of you from work that are going to read this, and I wasn't able to see when we were in, I apologize! I'll try to bring her in again soon! Anyway, we did take a trip in to work today and were able to see quite a few. Then, we went to lunch with Missy and Mike, two of Mommy's great friends! We went to McDonald's so she could play around and not have to sit still! It was a nice visit and everyone was glad to see her again...finally!
