Dallas Cowboys QB Tony Romo has a broken pinkie finger and will be out of commission for 4 weeks. The sports columns say that Romo suffered the injury during Sunday&amp;#8217;s 30-24 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. We believe that, but we also think there were other factors at play. Here&amp;#8217;s a hint:  Image: Used with permission of www.splashnewsonline.com Jessica Simpson, Romo&amp;#8217;s bustier half, probably has something to do with it. And no, we aren&amp;#8217;t going to our stand-by blame game and insinuating that she&amp;#8217;s jinxing him again. (Though we&amp;#8217;d be foolish to rule it out). Nor are we going to suggest that her wearing Dale Earnhardt Jr.&amp;#8217;s number yesterday instead of Tony&amp;#8217;s #5 is the problem, if only because she was at the Bank of America 500 and the NASCAR tank top works. So what does Jessica Simpson have to do with Tony Romo&amp;#8217;s broken pinkie? OK, we admit that this is a long way to go for this but our theory is that . . . he has her wrapped around his little finger, which placed undo stress on it, which made it that much prone to fracture. Oh come on. We told you it was a long way to go for that joke. You can stop rolling your eyes now. Really.
