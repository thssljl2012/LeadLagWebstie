Today I tried again to get to Homebush by bike. I lost the signs at Concord Road this time, closer to my goal. The route past the Bay Run (through Haberfield and Five Dock) is pretty yucky, with the bike path pretty much being bikes painted on the road and not much else. If I get the energy, I&amp;#8217;ll send a letter to Canada Bay Council, the Olympic Park people, and possibly the Commonwealth Bank people. But I may not get the energy. Total distance (according to mapmywalk) - 30 kilometres. Almost exactly an hour, which doesn&amp;#8217;t necessarily bode well for doing this on a work day, since I&amp;#8217;ve probably got up to 5 more kilometres to add on to it.
