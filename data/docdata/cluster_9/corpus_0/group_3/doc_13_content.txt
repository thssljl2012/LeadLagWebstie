ARGH. So N is on beaut. Really rather pissed off about it to be fair. I was the one who introduced it to her one lunchtime. She asked what sites I look up on my lunch break and I told her. Beaut.ie, Twenty Major, RTE news and BBC local news. And now she&amp;#8217;s on them all. She was even on Beaut the other day commenting about what a tragic loss it is that Twenty Major is shutting his site down. And just when I thought the blather was still sacred - that I could still say stuff on there and not be worrying&amp;#8230;I can&amp;#8217;t. I came in this morning and low and behold she&amp;#8217;s posted on the blather too. Fucking annoying. And I feel so stupid being annoyed - it&amp;#8217;s such a small thing to be annoyed about - and probrably doesn&amp;#8217;t warrant any of this at all. But in my head it most certainally does. I want to throw a temper tantrum right now. So badly. And means i&amp;#8217;ll have to take down the link to this blog too&amp;#8230;which is crap. And will have to watch what I say on there too. GRRR. In other news&amp;#8230;I had a phonecall at 4.30 yesterday on the office phone from my mam. Told her to call back at 5. So she did - spent the next 45 minutes chatting away&amp;#8230;v.embarassing. One of the guys from work was still in the office and sits on the diagonal to me. So he heard everything. It wasn&amp;#8217;t an embarassing conversation or owt&amp;#8230;was just odd to be talking to family while at work! But yes&amp;#8230;spoke to my mum, then my dad wanted a quick chat, then my sister woke up (she had an operation on Friday so was sleepy and ill) and wanted a word, then my great aunt and uncle turned up at the house so I had to have a chat with them, then dad wanted another quick chat, then mam&amp;#8230;jesus! It went on forever. Was dead nice though. Except mam&amp;#8217;s chats. I&amp;#8217;m in the shit a bit there. I used the wrong Barclays bank card to withdraw money the other day and it went into the overdraft and she&amp;#8217;s been getting loads of letters about it and argh. But yeah&amp;#8230;oops. Found out the guy I live with lost his job yesterday too. He&amp;#8217;s not sure what he can do anymore&amp;#8230;he phoned the landlord last night and told her he might have to move out. Meh. I really like him - we get on well. It&amp;#8217;ll be a shame to have him move out. But I guess if you can&amp;#8217;t afford to stay, then there&amp;#8217;s no real choice. Hmm.
