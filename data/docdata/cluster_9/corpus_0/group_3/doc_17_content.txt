I just noticed that it has been one year from today that I first posted in this journal from England, so I thought I'd post again. (For those looking for the good news post, see the one below.)I forgot to mention in my previous post that my team at Nationwide was so very kind to give me a gift and a card before I left. (It's a tradition that's always done on someone's birthday or when they leave, but this was a brand new team so I didn't expect it.) It was so sweet! They even got those who are left from my previous team (ISA Management) to sign the card. :) The gift was a box of Quality Street chocolate (yummy) and a bottle of wine (I might try a little because it was a thoughtful gift). It's also tradition that the one whose birthday is it or who is leaving brings in treats for the team, so I brought a box of brownies, a box of flapjacks (http://www.scottishrecipes.co.uk/flapjacks.htm for those who don't know what they are), and a box of caramel/chocolate/biscuit bites. They were quite happy when they saw them. :DAnyway, that's it. I'll let you know how Barclays goes next week.
