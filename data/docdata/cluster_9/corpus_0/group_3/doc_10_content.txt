After came back from diving, we spent another hour tocleane the boat. ThenI rushed back to home and get ready for Kim &amp;amp; Dean's Wedding. I've known Kim &amp;amp; Dean for7 years from ANZ bank. They've been together for 6 years and I am glad to them finish this &amp;quot;long run&amp;quot; and go to the next stage to start their new lives together.  Congratulation!~~~
