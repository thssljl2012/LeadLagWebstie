Well, as I did last year, I winged it--if that's possible--running slower than I am accustomed to--this year's Bank of America Chicago Marathon. I completed every one of them since 1990. That race was supposed to have been a one time deal. While taking photographs--115 of them--along the course, I ran through the finish line at 4 hours and 26 minutes. Good enough to finish among the top-half.But ext year, if my body allows it, I plan to run faster. And leave my camera at home.Look for a more extensive post on the marathon--most likely tomorrow morning--because I have a feeling I'll be heading to sleep soon. The winners will probably be wide awake for a while as they celebrate their triumphs. For the men, Evans Cheruiyot was the victor, running a very fast  2 hours, 6 minutes, 25 seconds.(Considering the warm conditions, late 70s when they finished, Cheruitot ran superbly.) For the women, Russia's Lidiya Grigoryeva came across the line at 2:27:17.There is your humble marathoner in the picture. That's the Aon Center in the background, Chicago's third tallest building.Technorati tags: Chicago Marathon running marathon run Chicago illinois sports athletics Bank of America
