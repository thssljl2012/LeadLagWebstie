I hate to play the waiting game. All day I've been waiting already for the call from Barclays whether I got the job or not. And the only time today when I could not answer my phone due to being in a meeting they're calling me! And now they're not calling me again. Man, that sucks. Big time. I'm tired like hell and I should do some more preparation for tomorrow's final round interview with CMC Markets. And after that it is waiting again. I hate it. I still do love Jensen big time though ;D
