           Yes, me. I am freaking out. So I'm leaving London in four days. I don't really have that much to do. I just bought some boxes, so I can get started with my packing, and other than that all I have to do is go to Barclays. Also, I have to figure out rent for the last week, ie how to pay it. Easy peasy.Its a good thing that I don't have to much to do. Since on Friday, I have to go to Paris to interview for a GOB. Yes, you heard me correctly. Its almost too hard to believe. After a week of putting this position in Jackson Hole out of my head, I heard back from MT this morning. Asking me if I could come to Paris-expenses paid-for a job interview. So, after a couple of emails back and forth it looks like I'm headed to the Marriot Rive Gauche on Friday for an interview at 4.30.I haven't been to Paris before so i'm thinking of staying there on Friday night too. I mean why not, right?
