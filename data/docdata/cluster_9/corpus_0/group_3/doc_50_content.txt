i read in the papers that witch doctors / peverts in tanzania are killing albinos for their body parts for 'medical' uses. i worried about a certain friend at that point...but seriously, the world is going to the dumps.  the cruelty of man's heart knows no boundaries.i think anyone and everyone has the potential to be evil, and im ashamed of myself for bearing nasty thoughts when im angry/moody/pmsing/cranky/for no reason. m.o shall refrain from such nonsense and remember about how it feels when diving. happy pure thoughts.ps: i hope i get to watch the barclays singapore open. adam scotts is coming to town! i got goosebumps just reading about the tournament in november. so yes, i still loveee golf :)
