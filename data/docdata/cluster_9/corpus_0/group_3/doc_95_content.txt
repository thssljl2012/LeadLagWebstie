My politics essay is done and handed in! I'm happy with it too, which is unusual for me when it comes to essays.To celebrate, today I took a day away from university stuff and went into the city with my camera. I ended up in Docklands, mainly because I've never been there before (except for football games at Telstra Dome and the part that you pass through on the City Circle Tram) and I wanted to photograph something new, I also wanted to see the Southern Star Observation Wheel now that it is complete (I have no interest in riding on it, due to my severe fear of heights but it looks pretty awesome) and check out the outlet stores at Harbour Town. It was a fun day, despite the overcast weather and I took a heap of great photos.This is the Southern Star Observation Wheel as seen from Harbour Town, the wheel is 120 metres (390 feet) high, this is equivalent to a 40 storey building.A different shot of the observation wheel.Another angle of the observation wheel.A close-up shot of one of the observation wheel pods leaving the loading station.One last shot of the observation wheel.The walls of the Harbour Town precinct were decorated with some pretty cool murals, this one has tennis balls inlayed into it.Another mural at Harbour Town, this one has hairbrushes and combs forming the hair.Another Harbour Town Mural, this one features crockery.One last mural.A W-Class Melbourne tram.The Bolte Bridge.A random residential building.Another random residential building.The headquarters of the National Australia Bank.Rialto Towers in the CBD, the tallest office building in the southern hemisphere when measured to roof-height.AFL House, headquarters of the AFL.An old wool shed.Telstra Dome with the Melbourne CBD in the background, the building on the far right is Eureka Tower the tallest residential building in the world measured to roof height.The Seven Network's Melbourne headquarters.Docklands marina, looking back towards the CBD.Docklands marina, looking out towards the Bolte Bridge.Sculpture art.A different angle of the same piece of sculpture art.Another piece of sculpture art by the same artist.Cow Up A Tree sculpture.Wind sculpture.You can expect a lot more of these posts over the summer, especially as I'm a) spending seven weeks up in Sydney over Christmas and plan on spending much of my time exploring the city and b) my parents are buying me an external HD for christmas which means that I'm going to be spending my economic stimulus money on an Olympus E-520 Digital SLR Camera instead. I'm so excited about this, I've wanted a DSLR for years.
