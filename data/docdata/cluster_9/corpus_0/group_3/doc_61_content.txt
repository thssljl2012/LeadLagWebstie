Diabolically genius&amp;#8230;. Boing Boing: &amp;#8220;A man robbed an armored car outside a Monroe, Washington bank and used a dozen unwitting accomplices to act as decoys during his getaway. He hired the accomplices on Craigslist and instructed them to wear very specific clothing. From King5.com: &amp;#8220;I came across the ad that was for a prevailing wage job for $28.50 an hour,&amp;#8221; said Mike, who saw a Craigslist ad last week looking for workers for a road maintenance project in Monroe. He said he inquired and was e-mailed back with instructions to meet near the Bank of America in Monroe at 11 a.m. Tuesday. He also was told to wear certain work clothing. &amp;#8220;Yellow vest, safety goggles, a respirator mask and, if possible, a blue shirt,&amp;#8221; he said. Mike showed up along with about a dozen other men dressed like him, but there was no contractor and no road work to be done. He thought they had been stood up until he heard about the bank robbery and the suspect who wore the same attire.&amp;#8221; Armored truck robber uses Craigslist to make getaway
