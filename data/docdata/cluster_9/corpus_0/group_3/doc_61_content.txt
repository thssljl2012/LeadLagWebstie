The Champions Tour's AT&amp;amp;T Championship is the annual event in the San Antonio area.&amp;nbsp; For years, it has been played at Oak Hills - an AW Tillinghast course that the players love.&amp;nbsp; It's a classic.&amp;nbsp; Remember the Tillinghast course played at the Barclays - Ridgewood Country Club?&amp;nbsp; Remember how awesome that was?&amp;nbsp; Oak Hills is in that category.&amp;nbsp; It has hosted 20 professional tour stops.&amp;nbsp; No longer, though. The PGA Tour is moving this event to its TPC San Antonio property.&amp;nbsp; More specifically, they are moving it to the AT&amp;amp;T Canyons course at TPC San Antonio.&amp;nbsp; Saying that just makes me cringe. But, Tim Finchem has no reservations about it whatsoever.&amp;nbsp; Still, players come to the event to play the Tillinghast layout.&amp;nbsp; So, if AT&amp;amp;T Canyons is a dud, then will the field be as strong next year?&amp;nbsp; Fred Funk isn't sure it's a good idea to move.  &amp;ldquo;It bothers me,&amp;rdquo; Fred Funk, the current Schwab Cup points leader, said last week. &amp;ldquo;I would think and hope that the next golf course is a good, quality golf course. It's very seldom that any of our modern golf courses stand up to one of these old traditional courses we play. I'll be surprised if it is.&amp;rdquo;  So, what do you pick?&amp;nbsp; History and a strong field, or the sponsor and a new course? &amp;nbsp;
