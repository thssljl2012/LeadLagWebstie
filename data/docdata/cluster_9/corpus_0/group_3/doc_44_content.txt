 Isiah Thomas used to be if not a great man then at least someone worthy of respect.  He was an underappreciated ball player and someone who led his team to large success.  In the years that came afterwards, he tarnished that reputation with a series of disastrous move to the point where you didn't think there was any more bottom left.  Failed ownership in the CBA.  Blundering stewardship of the Knicks.  And, then, that whole sexual harassment thing.  Now?A new low in which to sink.I don't have anything else to say other than it's such a shame.
