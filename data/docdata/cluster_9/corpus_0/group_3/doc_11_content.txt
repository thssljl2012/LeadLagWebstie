 I have confession.I signed up to mobile internet on my phone.Coz it's reasonably priced. $8 for 100MB. WAY cheaper than in Malaysia.And I've been goofing around quite a bit. Downloaded the eBuddy chat thingie so I can use MSN and Gtalk on my phone. But somehow it only works for the first time, and stopped working after that.Then I also checked out this World Mate thingie I have on my phone. It has the map of Australia in it. Looks like I won't need to be afraid if I ever get lost. Then I found out ANZ bank has Mobile Banking, or MBanking as they call it. Registered for it, downloaded the application. Poked around a little. It's like WAY cool okay. I can check my balance, transfer money between my accounts, transfer money to other people, check my mini statement etc. And I can also choose to have it send me an SMS alert daily, weekly, fornightly or monthly to update my about my bank balance for all my accounts. That's awesome. Now I can go groceries and won't have to go "oh crap do I have enough money to pay for my groceries?". Or I can randomly decide to go shopping at DFO or Brand Depot and transfer money on my way there. How cool right. Totally.I really really really really need to spend more time on my assignments. Sigh.Tomorrow will be possibly the last gathering for those of us Malaysians who came to ANU in 2006. Well, for me at least. Coz a lot of us will be graduating this year. And will move on to be corporate slaves. I guess it's an early farewell party before it gets all teary and emo when graduation comes.
