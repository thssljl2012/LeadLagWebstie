Day 14.So it's been a fortnight! Wow, the time just slips by, I've been at my job for a full week now and I'm feeling pretty good about it. I'm starting to get over the initial culture shock and I'm settling in pretty well, waiting for my first paycheck!But today I just want to talk about a few things in Korea which have grabbed my attention, and which, to people back in the West might seem pretty cool or fun!First of all, I&amp;nbsp;want you to watch this www.youtube.com/watch, this is an honest to god real advert on Korean TV, and it was playing in the subway. Now, I&amp;nbsp;can just imagine if an advert like this came out in England... what would happen?!? And it's not the only one, Korean broadcasting is full of things like this, adverts for serious things are made in a way that would seem 'childish' or 'cute' in England. An advert which I&amp;nbsp;believe was for life insurance (no less then AIG&amp;nbsp;Korea) , had random trumpet sounds, and cartoon faces all over, the english subtitle for the advert was 'Life insurance for life', which is apt.That brings me on to the second point, almost everything important has a romanization, a translation into english, a lot of&amp;nbsp; bars and public areas have this (such as subways). But the source of their translation is directly comparable to the importance of the place. Generally public utilities like subways and roads have perfect english on them, but a lot of trendy bars which want to appeal to the ever growing foreign population have obviously used an online internet translator for their signs. Notable ones near to me are:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Coffee with Bear&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - I'm not even sure what that is supposed to be.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;CHICKEN!&amp;nbsp;BEER!&amp;nbsp;ORCHESTRA!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - A&amp;nbsp;classy establishment&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Come to enjoy our famousness&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Bask in it!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Exciting wolfcastle!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - This was outside a crockery shop, so... I&amp;nbsp;dont knowThere are a lot more of these Engrish signs, I'll keep my eyes open for more, hopefully next month I'll be able to photo some good ones when I&amp;nbsp;can afford a camera!
