Besides someone who has near-record unfavorability ratings...Meet Ashley Todd, a 20-year-old McCain volunteer from Pennsylvania.Ashley went to a Bank of America last night, withdrew sixty dollars. The next thing that happened was an act of unspeakable depravity. A fervent Obama supporter, described by Ashley as a big black man, saw either her bumper sticker or campaign button, tackled her to the ground, out of sight of the cameras, assaulted her and told her "You WILL support Barack Obama." To emphasize the first initial of the first name of the candidate she should vote for, the assailant carved a "B" into the side of her face, before groping her and giving her two black eyes. Here's a picture of that horrendus incident:Now, if it hasn't been apparent this whole time that the event never took place, just look at the picture. No burst capillaries in her eyes from the black eyes. She even carved the goddamn B backwards, as though she were looking into a mirror! I'm not typically one to revel in people's stupidity, but all I'm saying is I'd laugh if it became a permanent scar. It looks like it was done with a pen cap though, so I'm sure she'll be all right.She didn't get her story straight, she told the police multiple versions of what happened, she didn't remember details that she told police originally, and tried to cover this all up with "I forgot lol"sourceSo there's that. The final race-baiting nail in the once-honorable campaign's coffin.
