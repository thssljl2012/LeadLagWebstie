so i'm on this liquid fast thing where i eat only for an evening meal, so that family don't ask any questions, coz i really cba with that! anyhoo i had to go out for a coffee today, but thankfully that was only(!) 70 cals, but then the real bummer is i was watched at lunch so had to eat, and i had about 300 cals, which seriously smells coz i don't even want that much in a day, never ming one sitting. so i think today's total is gonna be somewhere around 700 cals, but that is with exercise, so that is OK. well not really but hey.good news about yesterday tho...lost 1kg/2.2 pounds in one liquid fast day, and that is with eating evening meal, so that is pretty cool. i think i will probably be right back on track on monday, which is a bit shitty having to wait that long, but with the weekend and all...i would rather eat an evening meal tho now, than not eat it and be asked questions, jus so that i can perfect myself better for longer.anyone on anything similar, or just got any general comments about this rather waffled post lol?xx
