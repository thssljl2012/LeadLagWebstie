In case you&amp;#8217;ve been under a rock and missed Matt Drudge&amp;#8217;s scoop of the century in reporting on that awful Obama supporter/thief who attacked poor young McCain supporter, and if by some chance you actually believed it, Ashley Todd the McCain campaign volunteer from Texas, who reported she was attacked by a 6 foot four African American Obama supporter in Pittsburgh&amp;#8217;s black Mecca &amp;#8220;Little Italy&amp;#8221; because he saw her McCain bumper sticker, confessed it was  all a hoax. Within minutes of the initial report &amp;#8220;The Right&amp;#8221; was all over this, as fast as &amp;#8220;The Left&amp;#8221; will be to be all over it now that the truth is known. Ashley initially told police she was robbed at an ATM in Bloomfield, and that the suspect became enraged and started beating her after seeing her GOP sticker on her car.  &amp;#8220;The commander added that Todd will face charges; but police have not commented on what those charges will be. &amp;#8220; It may not be a crime in Texas to report a crime which didn&amp;#8217;t happen, especially if the perpetrator of that crime is African American and an Obama supporter, but I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure it&amp;#8217;s a serious crime in PA. At the very least she should be charged with giving Matt Drudge and his unhinged minions a collective orgasm, and perpetrating a hoax so transparent even Michelle Malkin  figured it out. If you&amp;#8217;re planning a Hoax: Watch out for that google cache&amp;#8230;. My Space is not your friend&amp;#8221;  &amp;#8220;Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her cloths off, but its better if you do.&amp;#8221;  Twittering the set up is maybe not a good idea: * atodd: Thanks to everyone for your thoughts and prayers- I&amp;#8217;m phonebanking so let&amp;#8217;s all work together and get John McCain elected #litf08 Thu, 23 Oct 2008 18:55:41 +0000 * atodd: Oh the blog I will be making soon&amp;#8230; Its been a rough night #litf08 Thu, 23 Oct 2008 03:52:58 +0000 * atodd: Pretty sure I&amp;#8217;m on the wrong side of pittsburgh Thu, 23 Oct 2008 00:45:59 +0000 * atodd: Stubbornly searching for a bank of america to avoid ATM fees. Thu, 23 Oct 2008 00:23:21 +0000  &amp;#8220;No photos of Todd are being released by Pittsburgh Police at this time.&amp;#8221;  On a positive note they don&amp;#8217;t have to waste precious tax payer dollars doing a mug shot, they have what has to be the most perfect mug shot of all time on record.  This girl doesn&amp;#8217;t represent normal Republicans anymore than the fake perpetrator would have represented Democrats, or any more than this 20 year old twit represents most twenty year old women. What have we learned from this? Matt Drudge (and those like him pretending to be reporters on either side), are scum, try not to step on him or those like him on the way out, that shit sties to your shoes. Let&amp;#8217;s move on.    Share and Enjoy:                                        ...
