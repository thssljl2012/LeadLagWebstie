&amp;#8230;I looked back4 years to what I postedto my blog onOctober 8, 2004, for inspiration. Unfortunately, even that day wasn&amp;#8217;t all that interesting. I blogged about the Circus being in town and having to smell the elephant piss and manure as I commuted through North Station (the circus takes place upstairs at the Boston Garden/Shawmut Center/Fleet Center/Bank of America Center/TD BankNorth Garden. Phew. I also commented on stupid sports fan yelling and screaming on the local Fox Morning News (one of them letting slip and F-bomb on live TV). Still, a circus and naughty words is more exciting than what&amp;#8217;s going on in my life right now. I&amp;#8217;m fighting a cold (cough cough) and I watched the presidential debate last night. Why does McCain keep saying &amp;#8220;my friends&amp;#8221; after every comment? He&amp;#8217;s not my friend. *I don&amp;#8217;t have a single photo of me from October 2004 so I&amp;#8217;m posting the next best thing&amp;#8230;a photo of Dusty in her favorite pink Barbie shirt.
