Got lots to blog about, not least of which is the final of series one of Ashes to Ashes, but it&amp;#8217;s late and I CBA. Instead, I just laughed my ass off at Penny Arcade, a regular occurrence and something which Only the Few will understand. Like this one. So, to all those fans, the l33t, those In the Know, who remember what it was like Back in The Day, this one&amp;#8217;s for you. You are my breathren. I embrace you.
