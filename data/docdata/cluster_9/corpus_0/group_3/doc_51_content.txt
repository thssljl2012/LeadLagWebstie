Time was 5:50:36--Could have been better, but could have been worse. I walk/ran the last 10 miles. It was hot with highs in the 90s, but I survived and have now completed two marathons. I AM going to take a break from marathons, drop some weight, and hopefully do my first triathlon this summer. Thanks to friends and family who wished me well. I thought about you all today. I also want to thank my sweet boyfriend, Martin who helped me finish strong!
