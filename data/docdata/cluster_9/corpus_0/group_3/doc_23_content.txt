  STATESVILLE, N.C. (Oct. 7, 2008) &amp;#8211; Elliott Sadler and the No. 19 Stanley Dodge are changing their look with a passionate pink paint scheme for the Bank of America 500 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race on Oct. 11 in Charlotte. The pink paint scheme is in support of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month and Susan G. Komen for the Cure.   Sadler, who races each week with a pink ribbon decal above the driver&amp;#8217;s side door on the No. 19 Dodge, is excited for the opportunity to lend support to breast cancer awareness.   &amp;#8220;Last year my mother, Bell, was diagnosed with breast cancer, so this is a cause that is very near and dear to my heart,&amp;#8221; said Sadler. &amp;#8220;We are fortunate that she was able to fight and is now on the road to recovery, but I&amp;#8217;m excited to get involved with Susan G. Komen for the Cure to help support breast cancer awareness and raise money for research to find a cure.&amp;#8221;   Stanley is making a $100,000 donation to Susan G. Komen for the Cure in support of the initiative. Following the race weekend, all of Sadler&amp;#8217;s uniform items are going up for auction with proceeds set to benefit Susan G. Komen for the Cure.  &amp;#8220;Stanley Tools is proud to be supporting breast cancer awareness and Susan G. Komen for the Cure,&amp;#8221; said Rebecca Durham, Motorsports &amp; Sponsorships Manager of Stanley Tools. &amp;#8220;Elliott has told us how important breast cancer awareness is to him and his family, and Stanley Tools is equally as passionate about the cause. This is a big weekend for Elliott, Stanley Tools and Susan G. Komen for the Cure and we are thrilled to be lending our support.&amp;#8221;   The pink Stanley logo that appears on the No. 19 Dodge and on Sadler&amp;#8217;s firesuit marks the first time in the company&amp;#8217;s 165 year history that its logo will change to a color other than Stanley Yellow.  Elliott Sadler Quotes: What would it mean to you to visit victory lane this weekend: &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m really excited for this weekend. We are bringing a car that should definitely give us a chance to win. It&amp;#8217;s been our best car all year and we are always racing to win. Winning in a pink Stanley/Susan G. Komen for the Cure car would definitely be a very special thing for me. With everything that has happened in the last year with my Mom it would mean a lot to win a race in this car with her in attendance.&amp;#8221;  Chassis Info: The No. 19 Stanley/Susan G. Komen for the Cure Dodge is racing chassis No. 256; which recorded a fourth place finish at Indianapolis, ninth at Michigan and 10th at Kansas. Chassis No. 240 will serve as the backup.
