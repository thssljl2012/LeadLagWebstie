 08:10 Think I went a little too hard in BodyPump yesterday. Must have been way overly enthusiastic as now my HAND HURTS and can&amp;#8217;t even type. Ouch. # 08:46 Went to pay for my flights.. And it&amp;#8217;s gone up by $800! ARGH. And times that by 4, that&amp;#8217;s an additional $3,200! ARGHHHHHHHHH. # 10:30 Wow. tinyurl.com/4tdpvj *dreams* # 11:17 Great. Looks like QBE &amp;amp; CBA are gonna take over Suncorp (Today&amp;#8217;s AFR Article). ANOTHER MERGER. OMGGGG. # 19:32 Finally unpacked my luggage from my snow trip (which was a month ago) and FOUND MY BELOVED J.CREW GLOVES. Yayness. #  Posted in Random&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
