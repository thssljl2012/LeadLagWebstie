Social security only wants people to have $2000 in their bank account(s). In Bank of America I had a bunch in my savings so I put some in my checking to spend to get down to $100 and make the math easier. From amazon I bought 2 glacier books, "Odyssey" by Symphony X, and "The Crucible of Man (Something Wicked Part II)" by Iced Earth. Mom wants me to buy winter stuff with it too :PAww the chickadees are out..cute heheToday's stupidest quote:Weakest Link host Anne Robinson: What is the official language of Israel?Contestant: Latin
