Robbery suspect makes escape down river on innertube www.privateofficer.com  MONROE, Wash. Oct 1 2008 By: Rick McCann NTL. ASSOC. PRIVATE OFFICERS http://www.privateofficer.com/ Police here say a man who robbed an armored car driver at a bank Tuesday morning jumped into the Skykomish River on an innertube to get away. Police spokeswoman Debbie Willis said the man, who was armed with a gun, robbed an armored car driver making a delivery to the Bank of America branch at 19917 Old Owen Road about 11 a.m. Mitch Ruth, who works across the street from the bank, said the robber sprayed the armored car driver with pepper spray and wrestled a bag of money away from the driver. Police believe that the robber was wearing a surgical mask and wig. Once the lone robber grabbed a money bag he then ran about 100 yards to a creek that runs into the river, making his getaway on what witnesses said was an inner tube. He then floated to an inflatable raft and soon disappeared according to one witness. Officers searched the water and riverbank, and a Sheriff helicopter was also dispatched to the area, but there was no sign of the man. Willis says investigators believe others involved in the crime could have picked him up at a nearby boat launch or park.
