From the marathon e-mails that I still get:"The 31st running of the Bank of America Chicago Marathon is in the books. A total of 33,250 participants started the 26.2-mile run on the streets of Chicago and 31,337 reached the finish linean impressive completion rate of more than 94 percent!"Impressive indeed! =D
