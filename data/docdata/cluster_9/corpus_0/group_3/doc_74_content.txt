Some of you that chat with me on Friendfeed know that last week, I made a decision to do a little traveling, to find out a little of what really is really going on on Wall Street, and yes, on Main Street.  (No, I'm not running for anything?! :)  I did commit some time ago to try and help small businesses achieve their rightful place in the Search Engine rankings.  Since then, many things have changed in a very short period of time.&amp;nbsp; I am continuing to travel on and off this week in NY, NJ and here in PA, to gauge reaction, speak more with people, as well as begin to decide what I want to do with 'the second half of my life' .... as I like to say.  So far, it's been a truly enlightening experience.&amp;nbsp; It's been great connecting with old friends as well as meeting new people&amp;nbsp; and with those that have a much better handle on the economy than I could ever expect to.  So, if SEO and Tech Daily is a little intermittent the next few days (and thanks to those who e-mailed, DM'd,&amp;nbsp; etc), that's what's happening.  I'm a hands-on kinda guy, and I want to hear the news from the people in the city, suburbs, as well as here in the country first hand.&amp;nbsp; These are truly challenging times for many.  I'm also aware that many of you are visiting this blog for the first time (because it was included in a few 'lists' the past few weeks).  Firstly welcome!&amp;nbsp; There are two feeds at the right.&amp;nbsp; One is this blog's feed which includes news and opinion, and a dash of SEO.  The other is our Google Reader shared feed.&amp;nbsp; Headlines and tech news (and opinion) from around the web, twice a day.  Back soon.&amp;nbsp; In the meantime, I'm going to continue my little journey to find out what people are thinking.   Stay tuned crew and, as always, Thanks! Charlie  edited 11:30 et cba
