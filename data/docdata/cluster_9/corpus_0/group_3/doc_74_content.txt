 The court room trials of former New Jersey Net and Philadelphia 76er, Jayson Williams, are not over. The lastest instalment in the tragic sequence of events sees his legal team gaining court approval to investigate the fact that an investigator on his case used a racial slur to describe the former NBA power forward.Williams was originally involved in the death of Costas "Gus" Christofi, 55, a driver who was hired to drive Williams' NBA charity team. Reports allege that Williams accidentally discharged a firearm whilst at his large property, which killed Christofi. Williams was ultimately charged with covering up the killing (along with other members of the charity team who were in attendance) and he currently is involved in a retrial on the charge of reckless manslaughter. This is where the evidence of racial slurs may come in to assist his legal team on the basis of an unfair investigation. Williams has previously attempted to make an NBA comeback, after originally retiring from the NBA in 1999 with injuries. However his CBA stint did not end with the double-figure rebounder making it back into the league. Subscribe to a stern warning by Email...
