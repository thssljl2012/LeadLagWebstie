Lunch in the city. So many options, so many of them overpriced and underdone. It&amp;#8217;s always a bonus to find great food that&amp;#8217;s great value. I&amp;#8217;d heard of Via Abercrombie a lot since they opened up a few years ago, but never managed to get there. They&amp;#8217;re tucked down Abercrombie Lane which runs between The Establishment and I think a Commonwealth Bank, off George street.  This petite little lane way is home to an awesome sandwich shop as well as an array of lurking smokers and cute vespas. Ignoring the smokers and head for the Orange sign, which has always kind of looked like a slice of cake to me, but others may disagree? Stepping inside this little box, the set up is straightforward: A Drinks fridge on your left as you walk in, just past that the coffee machine, straight ahead the sandwich bar and to the right one large communal table and a couple of smaller tables. All take away sandwiches range in price from $8 to $8.50 for the menu items, then increase and vary for the &amp;#8220;make your own&amp;#8221; options. They also serve the sandwich filling options as salad which bumps up the prices to $10.50-$11. I choose the vegetarian sandwich. I watch as she efficiently puts it together. I am intrigued by the fillings&amp;#8230;.I am quickly presented with my sandwich:  When I get back to the office, I quickly settle in and open it up:  I quickly get to the heart of it in order to fully check out what they put in it as the only description is as follows: &amp;#8220;Roasted Vegetables, Fresh Salad, Vogue Hoummous&amp;#8221;  Ok, what I see is a solitary green bean, beetroot, red cabbage, normal cabbage, eggplant, marinated mushrooms, maybe grilled zucchini too, cooked carrot and potato salad! Oh, not forgetting the hoummous underneath it all. This sucker was so big I only needed to eat half of it for lunch. I popped the rest in the fridge and had the rest for lunch today. Pretty damn good for $8.50! I&amp;#8217;ll definitely be going back and trying the steamed chicken, celeriac coleslaw, rocket and homemade herb mayo..hmm or maybe the chilli BBQ Chicken with rocket and roasted tomato pesto&amp;#8230;mmmm&amp;#8230;(that one smelled really good!)
