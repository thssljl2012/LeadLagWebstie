     I attended the &amp;#8216;Brighter Marketng&amp;#8217; network event held by Barclays. The speaker, Robert Craven, had plenty of sound advice on running a successful business, and in volunteering to assist in note taking, gave me the opportunity to present a short 4 minute talk on marketing online. It was a great opportunity to gain some exposure for JCU, and I&amp;#8217;m sure many of the attendees will leave the event remembering a good place to go if they need design work. Update: www.lastlaughcomedy.com went live today.
