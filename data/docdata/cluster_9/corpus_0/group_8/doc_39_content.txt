So today&#8217;s post is all over the place but hopefully you find it interesting &#8230; I&#8217;m sorry to disappoint anyone that saw the title and thought of &#8220;Chase&#8221; as either Vincent Chase from Entourage or Dr. Chase from House. We are thrilled with the haircut Carter received yesterday and highly recommend Euphuria Pet Salon in North Hollywood. Not only did they do a great job but the people in the shop were incredibly friendly and helpful. Euphuria has been around for 12 years and a brief glimpse into their business tells us why. In addition to being professional and friendly the salon was really busy and it actually took us 4 days to get an appointment. There is something to be said for the combination of being busy and in business for 12 years. I know there are many great pet grooming options here in downtown and a lot of people really enjoy Muttropolitan. Grace is very welcoming and does a really nice job, but we&#8217;ve been looking for a place that cuts more to the standard and not just puppy cuts. It&#8217;s taken almost a year but I think we may have finally found a great grooming option for Carter.  Driving 20 minutes to get Carter a good grooming isn&#8217;t bad at all, especially when there are a million things to do in the area. It gave me time to pick up a few things at a massive Target in Burbank. I&#8217;m not sure of the mall name but it also included a Best Buy, tons of little stores, a Michael&#8217;s for the crafty people and even a Wendy&#8217;s! It was easy to occupy myself for 2+ hours while Carter was taken care of. Speaking of Target we heard another rumor this weekend of Target and Best Buy moving into the old Macy&#8217;s at 7th and Fig. One can only hope &#8230; We&#8217;ve been out that way before, most recently when our friends from out of town were here and we dropped them off at Warner Brothers for a studio tour. We notice the local Washington Mutual branch had a cute sign on it saying they are now Chase, but now the makeover appears complete as the giant sign outside was now Chase and all the ATMs appeared to be changed over.  You may recall how disappointed we were upon moving to California that banking with Chase was no longer an option since they had only one ATM in the state and it was in Disneyland. Not exactly convenient when we need a few bucks. We grudgingly switched to Bank of America and haven&#8217;t had any issues. I still prefer Chase online bill pay but the biggest draw in Chicago was how many ATMs they had. They are everywhere! After picking up Carter we made our way back home which meant a drive along Olympic (shhhh still the quickest way around LA) and at the corner of Olympic and Hope came across this ad on the Packard Lofts.  For ten months we can&#8217;t get any Chase love and now it&#8217;s everywhere. I&#8217;m not sure there is any reason to switch back unless we could get our cool debit cards with the Chicago skyline again. Do they do the same thing but with the Hollywood sign or something like that out here? I wonder &#8230; A disappointing shout out to Lola - I&#8217;m afraid Carter did not return with the John Denver. I think it&#8217;s more of something that grow itself out so we will keep an eye to see if it develops naturally over the next little while. Ha ha! Posted in Uncategorized
