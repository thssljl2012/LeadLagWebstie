The first Section II Class AA boys&#8217; basketball semifinal at Times Union Center is complete and Christian Brothers Academy withstood a furious fight from Shenendehowa to advance to the Section II Class AA title game next Tuesday with a 63-56 victory in overtime.  CBA junior guard Kameron Ritter put the Brothers up 49-47 with knocking down a difficult runner in the lane with 7.3 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. After a time out, Shenendehowa&#8217;s Matt Lee drove the ball down the left side of the court and buried a 17-foot jumper &#8212; with a hand in his face &#8211;at the buzzer to force overtime. Senior center Andrew Stire opened the overtime with a baseline jumper to put the Brothers up 51-49 and then sophomore point guard Galal Cancer took over. He made a steal and converted one of two foul shots. Following a missed 3-pointer by Shenendehowa&#8217;s Jose Reyes, Cancer drained a jumper and then stole the ball and fed Ritter, who scored and converted a three-point play to help provide the Brothers a 56-49 lead with 1:45 left.
