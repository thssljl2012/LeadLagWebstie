I met with Dan Leatherman, Pete Parise, and Kevin Grant earlier this week. They are all very excited about the coming year. Leatherman and Parise see themselves rising up the ranks of their respective organizations (Nationals and Carindals) and Kevin Grant looks extremely prepared for his March 18th Pro Day. Tomorrow, I will be celebrating with Matthew Watkins as he ties the knot with his beautiful fiancee. Grant and another soon-to-be Dynasty football client will be on hand at the event. The girlfriend is in town and we have a new layout. Let us celebrate! Here are some stories I missed over the past week: Baseball  Better enjoy that bargain for a year, San Fran!

Instead of throwing them up on the Friday Wrap-Up, I decided that I will put them together in a post that will probably be up on Monday.
