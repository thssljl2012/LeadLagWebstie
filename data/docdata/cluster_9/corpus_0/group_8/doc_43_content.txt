I read a report today thatIsiah Thomas is in active negotiation with the L. A. Clippers to become their next GM. Yes, the same Isiah Thomas that single handedly bankrupt the entireCBA when he was the owner of the league, ran the New York Knicks to the ground when he was the GM and coach of the team, is now seeking to become the next L. A. Clippers general manager. My question is, why? The Clippers are doing just fine destroying their own franchise by themselves. Why in the world would they need to hire outside help for something they are already doing so well by themselves?
