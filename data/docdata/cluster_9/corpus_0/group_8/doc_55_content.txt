Response from No.10 to a petition for a St. George's Bank holiday is more or less 'up yer kilt', as to be expected. Despite our neighbouring nations having theirs, we are to be denied ours. All sorts of spurious excuses such as we should have a British Day, etc were given and it appears that the Bradford police and council have already cancelled theirs. I hope that the organisers of of the holiday elsewhere will give No.10 the Chuchill 'V-sign' and go ahead anyway.
