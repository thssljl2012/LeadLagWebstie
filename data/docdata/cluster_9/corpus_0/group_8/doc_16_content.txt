ChicagoLady says: I received the attached in an email from Citibank.  It looks like the group No Doubt is now reformed, but how did they reform? Did they start attending church? Have they stopped using swear words? I'm not a huge No Doubt fan, but even I know they re-formed.  Maybe they should have stuck with the phrase "got back together"?It wouldn't surprise me if Gwen Stefani started attending, for instance, The Church of Stylish Handbags, or maybe The Church of Cutie-Patootie Children (seriously, the kids she's had with Gavin Rossdale *swoon* are a-freakin'-dorable!).  But I think it's much more likely that this writer forgot to include the hyphen and/or didn't realize that a better term to use here would have been re-formed...Thanks, ChicagoLady, for finding this one!
