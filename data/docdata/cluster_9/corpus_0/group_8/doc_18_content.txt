 For those that visit The Biz of Football, you have most likely noticed the links and images to other sites in the Business of Sports Network. Those sites (The Biz of Basketball, The Biz of Hockey, and The Biz of Baseball), along with The Biz of Football cover  a broad spectrum of professional sports in the U.S. and Canada, but its only a portion of the key news happening outside the lines.  To that end, BusinessofSportsNetwork.com will shift from simply being a portal of RSS feeds, and contact info for Bizball LLC, but instead will begin to cover all aspects of sports business. From auto racing to golf to MLS to MMA to tennis and beyond, BusinessofSportsNetwork.com will be expanding. Well also be highlighting key aspects from the NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL via our Focus On series highlighting research and stories on our Biz sites.  Lastly, I have shifted my personal blog into a more traditional platform, with link dumps being done daily to a variety of mainstream and alternative platforms across the internet.  I hope you will swing by these two new resources, see the changes, (a first glimpse is The Influence of Tiger Woods Return on the Business of Sports Network, as well as links to key stories on maurybrown.com), and make them part of your daily stop for sports news off the playing surface.
