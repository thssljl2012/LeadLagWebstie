       Because given today's news about a second AIG bailout, I think someone should be looking at exactly how much money they're spending on stuff like this and what they get for the money.Are Man United fans (like Torchwood's Kai Owen) more likely to do biz with the US insurance giant because some footie stars are wearing the AIG logo on their chests?How much of this is actual legit marketing of a brand name and how much is insurance execs liking their status as sponsors for sports, which gets them perks like great seats, hanging with players, etc.?And while we're at it, is the branding of sports arenas in the US going to go away with this financial hellhole as well? Because I'll tell you as a lifelong NY Mets fan that I would not step one foot in a thing that's named Citi Field, especially after all the gov't money they're taking.Photo courtesy Metro.co.uk.
