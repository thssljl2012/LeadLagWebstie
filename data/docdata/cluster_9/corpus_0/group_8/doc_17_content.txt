Recently, a local newspaper ran a story about supporting local businesses. Well, I certainly want to contribute to the growth of Anderson, so during my lunch break my family and I decided to stop by one of the newer businesses in downtown Anderson: Davis' Downtown Market. The market had a nice variety of offerings: tomatoes, bananas, cookbooks, sauces, ciders, dairy products, meats, baking supplies, snacks, drinks (in glass bottles!), and more. I imagine their offerings will continue to increase as the weather warms and fresh vegetables become more readily available.Today, I purchased a few tomatoes, a couple of bottles of imitation flavoring (butter and vanilla), and a Dr. Pepper (in a glass bottle!). If you haven't taken an opportunity to visit Davis' Downtown Market, it is located on Main St. across from Bank of America. Support a local business, get to know some new people, and enjoy a few great products.
