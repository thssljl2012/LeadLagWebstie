Great piece on Cleveland.com today about former Yankee Great, the American Idle himself, Carl Pavano.Bud Shaw, a columnist for the Cleveland Plain Dealer, discusses the Cleveland Indians' newest pitching acquisition after his first spring outting. Saturday Pavano faced the Oakland Athletics, pitching two perfect innings and then had to leave the game after soreness in his crotch area was reported.Okay, maybe the final fifteen words of that paragraph aren't exactly true. But he did pitch two innings in which he manufactured five ground ball outs.Shaw brings up a funny passage from St. Joe's Book of Verducci, an apparent Jeterism that occurred in the clubhouse one day while Pavano graced the Yankees with his presence:"Torre said the other Yankees despised Pavano. Bullpen catcher Mike Borzello told of Derek Jeter walking past Pavano and chiding him rhetorically: "You ever going to play? Ever?""If that isn't Captain-esque, I don't know what is. Good for Jeter.Note to the Indians: I hope AIG, err, 21st Century Insurance, isn't the company that you decided to insure Pavano's contract with. And I hope you have a good medical staff.
