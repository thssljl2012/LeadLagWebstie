The Blueshirts will receive a compensatory pick in June's entry draft, resulting from the death of former prospect Alexei Cheraponov.Though it is unclear whether Article 8.3 (b) of the CBA must be amended to accommodate this specific circumstance, the Blueshirts now stand to receive the 17th pick of this year's second round following Glen Sather's presentation yesterday at the NHL GMs meetings in Naples, Fla.
