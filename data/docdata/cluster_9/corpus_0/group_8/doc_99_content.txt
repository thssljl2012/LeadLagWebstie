with the release of TO (again) I was thinking that I would never want him on my team and really would not want him on the team I was cheering for to win.here is my list of worst teammates (major sports)1.John Rocker - this dude just could not keep his mouth shut2.Manny Ramirez - great talent but who can forget him tanking it in Boston just to get traded - watch - it will happen in LA if he does not get his way3.TO - come on - who needs him? in the long run he has not made any team better (sure, he has had bright spots but he can't maintain) - now that he is old and his talent is declining who would want him4.Isiah Thomas - maybe this one is not fair - great player but an awful owner - let's see - who ruined the Knicks, Pacers and when he bought the CBA he ran it so poorly it went out of business.5.Ricky Williams - just could not stay away from the hippy lettuceHere are some honorable mentions - Barry Sanders, Keyshawn Johnson, Latrell Spreewell, Bill Romanowski
