the last fri/sat was pretty insane for me. it was girls night out with the girlies: nicole, eelin &amp; mel, party till 4plus and a rush to pongol ay 7am for my whole-day photo shoot for my citibank campaign. gee.. i was pretty impressed with how i was not dozing off the whole day and surviving on a can of redbull! amazing!  anyhow the shoot was pretty fun! esp when you get to fool around and do all sorts of nonsense after!the only horrible thing about it was the 7am shoot. i think jon was just as dead as me and poor boy had to wakeboard in the icy cold water to get some good jump shots!  location 2: SMU green for the varsity shot with jin, amber and alvin  location 3: Zouk for the party shot with nicole, jen, jayne &amp; alvin ive never been into zouk this early since my Seventeen days      yep, we were happily behind the bar! just for a shot though.   Location 4: Clark Quay for shopping   Location 5: muay thai shot with shane &amp; nicole  finally finally it ended at like 930pm. by the time we were beyond tired.   it was a really really long day. typical shoot and all, but it was just a bit off to me. i thought there were so much stuff like the styling and hair &amp; makeup that could have been waaay better, but oh well. i&#8217;m not the stylist here. we&#8217;re just the client so we have no say just as long as the photos turn out like the mock ones we proposed. sucks, i know right?! that happens when your client doesn&#8217;t quite belive in you just because you are a student. and i absolutely hate that cuz im pretty damn sure ive sat through and done enough shoots to give u way better photos than the ones taken then. its just so frustrating how much you wanna shut some people up and throw their disbelief right back in their faces and go &#8220;i told you so?!&#8221;
