In our modern world of instant information and fast technology, the Slow Movement is becoming increasingly more appealing-and doesn&#8217;t just relate to food anymore.  In her new book, FIBER GATHERING: Knit, Crochet, Spin, and Dye More than 25 Projects Inspired by America&#8217;s Festivals (Wiley, March 2009, $27.99, Cloth; ISBN: 978-0-470-28935-8), Joanne Seiff explores the fiber festival culture-a movement that celebrates homegrown clothing production. FIBER GATHERING takes readers from coast to coast with a rich mixture of photos, essays, ideas, and top-of-the-line designer patterns. Broken down by regions, readers sample the flavor of each fair with patterns that pay homage to the unique focus of each festival.  Award-winning spinner Joanne Seiff pairs celebratory fiber event essays with instructions for creating more than 25 projects that reflect the rural couture of these sophisticated festivals and showcases the variety of projects available to participants, including projects for knitting, crocheting, spinning and shepherding, felting, rug hooking, and a dyeing tutorial. About the Author Joanne Seiff is a freelance writer, knitwear designer, educator, and fiber artist.
