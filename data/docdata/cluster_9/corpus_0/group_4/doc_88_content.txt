    This title will I am sure send my hits through the roof.&amp;nbsp; Anyway pervs there is nothing good in this post.    I goofed and assumed that becuase every other race I've ever done starts 9am that this one would too...so I planned my morning to get me here at 8am.&amp;nbsp; Well I arrived early and before I headed to the course I looked at the flyer for the race - CRAP - 10am start.    Not the end of the world - I found an Amish diner in Intercourse down the street from the course and am relaxing and having a bowl of oatmeal.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    Today's race should be fun - there is a coating of snow on the ground and its roughly 27 degrees - perfect cross weather.&amp;nbsp; No idea what the course will be like but if I like it - and there's a discount - I may do the 35+ masters race and do two today - although that might not be smart with Tacchino tomorrow morning.    Off to find a bank of america and head to the couse.
