I spot him a mile away. Standing there in a blue Bonds wifebeater with white and lime green floral shorts, looking like he should be at the beach instead of the mall.  I hear the girl behind the counter ask him, "Cheque or Savings?", as I give him the obligatory up-and-down while pretending to look at The New Scientist and The Economist.  "Cheque", he says.  He must bank with NAB like me.He acknowledges my stare and doesn't look away.  I circle around him for a little while. I see pale, white skin covering a lithe but muscular build. He heads towards Woolworths while I go the other way, to Soul Pattinson.  I turn around after a few metres.  He's looking back too.I sing softly some Roxette.  "Hold on tight, you know he's a little bit dangerous..."
