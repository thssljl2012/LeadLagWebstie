               I got a letter from the Bar this morning. It was not good news. They are calling me up for an investigatory hearing to discuss my employment terminations with both Beckett &amp;amp; Bank of America and the whole FAU debacle before they will provide me clearance for my character &amp;amp; fitness review. I am SO PISSED that they waited 9 MONTHS to notify me of this. The next available hearing date isn't until January 24th.The even bigger problem is that I HAVE to have my character &amp;amp; fitness clearance before I can do the Public Defender's clinic. Thus, it is looking like my plan for next semester just went completely to hell in a handbasket.
