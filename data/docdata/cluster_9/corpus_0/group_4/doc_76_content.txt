The Canadian Blog Awards are back on, and the first round of voting started today and ends on Friday, I think.  KnitNut.net was nominated in several categories: Best Personal Blog, Best Local Blog, and Best Activities Blog. (Thank you very kindly to those who nominated me; it felt good to see my blog on the list.) If you haven&amp;#8217;t checked it out, you should go look to see if your blog was nominated for a CBA this year. They don&amp;#8217;t notify you, and I don&amp;#8217;t think links from their website show up as incoming links either, since the CBA site isn&amp;#8217;t a blog itself. I took a very quick peek and was pleased to see a few of you* on the lists.  Windsor swept the blogging awards last year, and I&amp;#8217;m hoping Ottawa will do better this year. Hopefully the Canadian blogosphere won&amp;#8217;t punish us for that  godawful summer blogging slump we went through. &amp;nbsp;  *including you-know-who. TAGS:  Blogging About XUP  Ottawa
