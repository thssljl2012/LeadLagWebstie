Well 3 years of waiting was worth it!  We are now the proud parents of Piper Mei Rigney.  It was a long and emotional day for both baby and parents.  We left the hotel at 2pm and traveled about 30 minutes to CBA Government office.  When we arrived there was a group of parents from Spain receiving their babies and the place was crazy with crying children.  Their group of children were a little older so I think the separation was hard for the little ones.  It was truly chaotic and heart wrenching.  After about 20 minutes they left and it was our turn.  The babies were taken into a waiting room and then they called each family's name one by one and we got our babies.  Piper Mei seemed a little shocked and concerned by the whole ordeal, but did not really cry.  She also did not smile.  She clung to us and it was very sweet.  On the bus ride back to the hotel she fell asleep.  There were a few tears but not too many.  Scott had to go fill out paperwork and Steve and I hung out with her in the hotel room.  She finally started to feel good about 4 hours after we got her.  She would not take a bottle but Scott was able to feed her applesauce and rice cereal.   Once she was fed she started chatting.."dadadada".  She went right to bed with not tears.  Please pray for a restful sleep for us all tonight.  It is still amazing that we started the day without a baby and now we are proud parents for the second time.  I will post more tomorrow!  WOW!
