With one paper down and four more to go in 11 days. I can't wait to get it over and done with! My next paper is on Friday then two more next Wednesday then one LAST paper on the following Monday. Phewww....French paper was pretty tough. There were a lot of open ended questions. Oo well, I'm just asking for an 'S'. ZS had French paper too, but his was level 2. He S/U-ed too. Anyway, I wanted to eat the Mega Mcspicy for dinner... its double patty can! Damn big somemore, its like eating spicy chicken cutlets. I only ate the patty and I was damn full already. No more space for the bread. ZS ordered McWings which of course wasn't enough to fill his tummy, so we went on to order 'mee goreng' from Can 16. So we had like 3 different types of food and 3 drinks. Cos we bought starfruit juice some more. *pengs*But it was satisfying, OK I need to end this post abruptly to study for CBA on Friday!*Jiayoujiayou*
