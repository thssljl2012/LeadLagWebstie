This week I did my story about a lady from my hometown community (weston) named Dawn Arnold. Dawn is a single mother of four children who was basically living on the streets five years ago and now makes near $100,000 at her job with the Bank of America. THis story was fascinating because I felt so bad for her and it was remarkable how far she has come in such a little time. Dawn was fairly easy to talk to and eager to share her testimony. I also was able to get ahold of the lady who took her in to her home and get some insight on the situation from her. This story basically wrote itself after i got started. I enjoyed working on it and doing a piece about a story with a happy ending. I&amp;nbsp;think I paid more attention to A.P. style in this piece than my others (partially because I have been studying for an AP style test) and I feel it turned out well. I tried using some parallelism in the 2nd and third paragraph, not so sure how they worked out though
