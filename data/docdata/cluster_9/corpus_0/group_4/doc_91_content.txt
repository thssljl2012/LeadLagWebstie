I still think Terence is a big wuss who's too in touch with his feelings, but Sarah kinda grew on me and I was kinda sorry to see them eliminated (though I knew from the get-go that he would wuss out on the eating challenge, even before I knew he was a vegetarian).  Definitely sorry to see them eliminated ahead of the frat boys, who not only manage to be unlikeable because of their utter doofiness, but also because of pretty much every other character trait they have.  I don't even feel bad that the divorcees mocked them.  Dandrew give not only frat boys a bad name, but also nerds and Jews.  I generally like the other 3 teams, so if these idiots somehow end up in the finals instead of one of the teams that actually deserve it....H is really into finance lately.  She watches Squawk Box with A and announced today that she knows what a bailout is.  The kids both noticed that a nearby bank changed to a Bank of America, so we talked about how companies merge sometimes because one company is not strong enough to survive on its own, but if it merges with another, they can save money and continue.  T then commented that he was sad that the local Carvel (which closed a couple months ago) could not merge before it went out of business.
