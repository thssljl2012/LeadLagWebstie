 This evening, when I stopped at Bank of America in Gig Harbor to deposit some checks, my husband appeared at my elbow and asked the clerk if he could contribute to the Ed McMichael fund. The young woman in her early twenties stared blankly.Ed McMichael, 53, was a Seattle institution, but any South Sounder whos attended a sporting or theatrical event in our big sister city has probably passed by the tuba playing busker outside sporting venues, McCaw Hall or the Opera House.On October 25th McMichael was set upon by five young hooligans, savagely beaten and robbed near a bus stop in the 500 block of Mercer Street around midnight. Two of the youths, fifteen were caught and three more are being sought.This gentle musician who chose to make is living playing for tips in the open air was treated in the hospital for three days and released. He died sometime Sunday night or early Monday morning as a result of his wounds. He was discovered by his landlady when his brother arrived to take him to a doctors appointment.An informal grassroots memorial to McMichael will be held Saturday at 11 AM outside McCaw Hall. Interested musicians are invited to come and play in his memory.A memorial fund has been set up to defray funeral expenses for McMichaels burial. Any balance left from the fund will go towards a possible memorial for the musician. If you want to help, you can visit any Bank of America branch and contribute to Ed McMichael, the Tuba Man or send donations to:Edward the Tuba Man McMichael Memorial FundBox 4985Federal Way 98063The clerks at the Gig Harbor branch of Bank of America found McMichaels memorial fund and Dave plunked down his donation. We'll miss the Tuba Man when we attend events in Seattle.
