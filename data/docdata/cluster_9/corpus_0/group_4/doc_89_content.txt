Taken out my office window a couple minutes before the sky went dark. I think we're about 6 mi. away from Downtown, but I can basically see my neighborhood from here, if I crane my neck to the left. The tallest bldg. on the skyline / in the city is the pointy one towards the right, Bank of America Plaza.
