I woke up at 9am this morning because my alarm decided to go off even though I didn't set it. Ever since then I've just been laying in bed. It's now nearly 2pm. =/&amp;nbsp; Umm. This post has no point btw.My brother got cod5 yesterday *ali rolls her eyes at this point* it looks so awesome!&amp;nbsp;Except I can't play on it because my brother won't let me. It's a lot more gory. And there are usable tanks. And flamethrowers. Which reminds me, in the actual game everythings been set alight!&amp;nbsp;Which makes me wonder whether they've only just discovered fire or not... (in the game it's a WW2 situation.)Lmao.Gonna go see ghost town later.oh yeah switzerland was awesome!&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;would upload pics but they're bad and I cba. except:a) I want that fountain in my gardenb)&amp;nbsp;I want that clock in my garden :D GENEVA&amp;nbsp;FTWxx
