Yea, I&amp;#8217;m serious this time. If you can guess what I am talking about then whoop de doo. U can feel unrewarded just like me. First of all, this site is two years old with hits under 3,000. I will be making all my admins editors, and leave the rest of the workers alone.I don&amp;#8217;t want this site to be deleted. Second,hardly anyof my workerspost here and and hardly recomend it. And on places that show the most popular Dizzywood peeps, they don&amp;#8217;t recommend my site. Some have a list of peeps who dont go on DW or blog about it anymore and i dont wanna be on it, so dont add me there. Third, I am most of the time treated mean, when I tryto gather everyone once in a while, someone else takes them away in DW, and that&amp;#8217;s why I don&amp;#8217;t have a best friend in DW. Fourth, my mom said I cud get a membership over the summer, and now she says no because we have no money and I am gonna spend too much time on the compy. THe thing is, I was gonna use my own money and I already spend too much time. Fifth, I admit I am getting fat and eating a lot and such so I gotta lower down my compy habits if I can. Especially my blogging habits that make me post like 2-5 posts a day or sumthin like that. Sixth, I can attract predators to come to my site. Hackers can come, know my webby and DW username and try to hack it (and possibly be sucessful). Seventh, no one talks to me on my meebo anymore and I am going on it more. ANd look at my top of blog&amp;#8217;s thingy. Tell me all u want that my blog rocks, but the TOB tells the truth&amp;#8230; Eighth, when I had my birthday, I spent it alone and no one planned a party for me. (Thx CBA for the surprise party for me at Cafe CBA, but my birthday is more important to me. Wait, that surprise party was my bro&amp;#8217;s bday and my 2,000 hits party that no one from my site came to. Does that mean fire everyone who didn&amp;#8217;t come?) Ninth, &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t compare yourself to Frosty, she has a great personality and is a nice person&amp;#8221; -Lovely. I think that meant I am horrible and that I am low class. DOES HAVING MY OWN COMPUTER AND CAMERA MEAN I AM LOW CLASS! AND I DO HAVE A GREAT PERSONALITY EVERYONE MAKES FUN OF. I AM A NICE PERSON! Tenth, no one gives me anything yet I give. (Frosty&amp;#8217;s party that the attendants had a good time at and met buttercup, Chabello EVEN SCOOTER!) (KEVER&amp;#8217;S PARTY!) So here is my blogging will&amp;#8230; My Mean blog goes to GoGirlStar My ideas (the things I started thatnever became great) are going to1995c and Gigicool1234 (they don&amp;#8217;t have the right to let anyone else use them besides us) Maizian News/Memberships Chair is Moonflower1 and Purple. Cheekers can have what any mean guy wants from me. My biggest fan can have keep their name. I am giving away I&amp;#8217;m tearing down everything. If you really wanna read things about my site, then you&amp;#8217;ll need to be interested in electronics and other stuff. I will keep my posts and some widgets. Possibly some other pages and whatever. Also to prove the reason about the parties, I bet you won&amp;#8217;t even make a party for me and CBA will hold the record for most parties made for Maizy. Congrats. So If you can figure out what I am talking about, then the password for the next post is it. it will be ALL LOWERCASE and ONE WORD ENDING IN ING!
