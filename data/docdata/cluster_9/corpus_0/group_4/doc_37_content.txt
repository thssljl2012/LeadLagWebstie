Parker lately has said the funniest things.  For a while I was writing it all down for him later in life.  I have always said that parker may look like Kevin, but he is all me! Loud, opinionated, his way or the highway attitude, tender when necessary (but usually in private).  Well, a few days ago he came into the office (the only place to find me these days)  and I asked him if he wanted some M&amp;M's.....he casually looked at them and said "Are they dark chocolate"?  HA, I have passed on one more thing to my child!  I am a LOVER of the dark stuff.  No milk chocolate for me unless it's in the form of a snickers or peanut butter cup.  I was so proud.  Then last night he went and got the mail for me and in the mail was a Nationwide insurance envelope.  As he hands me the envelope he sings "Nationwide is on your side!"  Seriously too much TV for that kid.  Then Brynlee last night was using my toes to sing this little piggy, Her version is:  "this little pig goes to TARGET, this little pig stays home......... (you know the rest).  Do I have great kids or what!
