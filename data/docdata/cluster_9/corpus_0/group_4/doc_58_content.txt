Following on from the Barclays Asia Forum 2008 held on Friday, a dinner reception hosted by Barclays was held at the Singapore National Museum.  The museum has recently undergone renovations and it was my first visit there.  It was a marvelous opportunity to mingle and build networks over cocktails.  The highlight of the evening being the appearance of two special guests in the professional golfing field, Phil Mickelson and Darren Clarke.  A nice finish to the days event.Phil Mickelson (far left) and Darren Clarke (far right)With Phil Mickelson.  It was a privilege to meet the current 3rd ranking golf professional and from the conversation I had with him, my first impression of him was~"down to earth"!This performance was amazing, with ropes suspended from the ceiling and she didn't even have a harness so imagine how strong she is.The scene at the dinner receptionNot real ice cubes and neither do they function as an ice cube.
