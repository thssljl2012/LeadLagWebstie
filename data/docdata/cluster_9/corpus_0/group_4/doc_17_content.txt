It was a great morning to wake up to. Weather was fine and cool. Not too sunny. I was all set to walk with the professional golfers at the Barclays Open.BK proposed that we meet up for breakfast before heading to the event. He came over to my place and picked me up at 8:30am.We headed for Botanic Gardens.This was my 2nd time in the same week - having breakfast at Botanic Gardens. I thought I'd be eating at the same place this time, but to my surprise, BK picked Halia! Nice. I had dinners at Halia before but never breakfast. It was a very nice experience.I ordered the gourmet breakfast set with white asparagus, ham, fried eggs and cheese in truffle oil. It was sooo delicious. I'd definitely wanna be back here again. Thanks for the decadent breakfast.The gardens was pretty crowded. I bumped into Joanna A and her family there. It was a pleasant day, guess everyone was out making the most of it. :)
