Hey asshole, you drove by the line a few weeks ago and screamed, "Get back to work you poor losers!" Well guess what bitch, we're back to work now and I'm making more money than you. How do I know this?&amp;nbsp;I saw you working at Bank of America. Having dated a bank teller, I know how much they make and it's not much. If you're lucky you are bringing home $15 an hour. The teller I knew made a whopping $11 an hour, which seems to be the standard teller hourly wage. So, dumbass.. If you're making $11/hr and I'm making $22.57/hr, that means i'm making twice your goddamn wages you idiot. Ya you didn't agree with the strike. Tough shit. In the end my pay went up 11%, my pension and medical packages strenghtened while I received a fat bonus. I will be bringing home 57k this year (inlcuding our bonuses). Now quit running your mouth. "Poor losers." Hahaha, good call. Enjoy sitting behing a fucking counter all day, doing the same goddamn thing over and over. That's a chicks job anyway you fag.
