I stopped at the bank on the way home to pay the wolves at my door.  That, in itself, is generally not so special.  Today, though, an Angry Fat Man was browbeating one of the tellers over some bank transaction having to do with his  (I think) paycheck.  And AFM was really, fucking loud about it.  Dude, what the hell?  Why don&amp;#8217;t you man up and realize that the tellers just work there?  They don&amp;#8217;t have anything to say about your money.  They taking from point A and shunt it to point B.  Fucking with the mild manner teller isn&amp;#8217;t gonna get you anything but an outlet to vent your Angry Fat Man rage.The other thing?  He shouted &amp;#8220;You all should got to Bank of America!  They&amp;#8217;re so much better and there&amp;#8217;s no bullshit.&amp;#8221;  Christ, what an asshole.  Get out of my bank.  I&amp;#8217;ve never had a damn problem with them.  Some woman behind me was bitching about her mortgage loan and trying to get rid of it in the same angry vein.  Guys.  Relax.  I know we&amp;#8217;re economically shitfaced over here in the US of A, but getting mad at your teller isn&amp;#8217;t gonna do JACK for the economy.Go jog.Go shadowbox.Go roleplay.But just...leave the rest of humanity alone.  They&amp;#8217;re facing the same challenges you are.  Getting pissed at them is not gonna make you feel better and it sure as fuck isn&amp;#8217;t going to do anything for them.Angry Fat Man?  I saw you light up before you went in the bank, and I sure as hell saw you light up when you came out.  You&amp;#8217;re gonna get lung cancer and then you&amp;#8217;re going to be really fucking angry, then.  Stop harassing people and go...find some damn Zen.Jesus.   I dunno if I&amp;#8217;m annoyed or amused, but we&amp;#8217;re gonna settle on a mix.
