to diet. Seriously. I'm doing shedloads of exercise and it's actually kicking in now so provided I don't do the going overboard thing I&amp;nbsp;am not going to diet. I was all fired up yesterday to go full on Atkins but seriously, it's too much effort. Will just stick to healthy fruit and veg and lean meats/fish. And ignore the chelsea bun I&amp;nbsp;am busy eating!
