It was my very first time. I had watched golf tournaments on TV before but watching it live was a totally new experience for me. It was an exciting and awesome thing to do. The crowd, atmosphere and the good looking golf pros. Man!!! I think I'm going to be addicted to golf from now on.LeaderboardStopover for a cool beer at the Harry's Bar tentI spent the day following Phil Mickelson, Chris Rodgers and Ben Leong. They were on the same flight. So I walked, stopped, watched and stalked. :) All the hits and the misses, I was there! The weather was nice, too. Ain't too warm. It was an extremely enjoyable experience.I managed to catch Lam Chih Bing and Chapchai Nirat playing their last hole. When Chih Bing, in his green striped Callaway golf shirt, walked towards the green at the 9th hole (round 3), the crowd exploded into applause. We were all so proud of him for performing so well.Phil Mickelson (in Barclays blue shirt) and Chris Rodgers (in purple shirt) walking alongside each other.Phil the leftyI was able to catch Padraig Harrington, Charl Schwartzel, Daniel Chopra, Jeev Milkha Singh and Shigeki Maruyama tee-off at one of the course. :)Heh! I was so excited that I actually skipped lunch.
