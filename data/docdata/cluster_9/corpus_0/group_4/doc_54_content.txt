I voted this morning. I had a very hard time not going all the way to bottom and voting for Ralph Nader. I am glad it's November, but, woah, things are moving awfully quickly. I feel as if last week I was on top of things, but this week I have fallen very far behind. I'm a bit concerned that all of my work will be done in time, especially when you factor in all of the group work. I'm wondering if I'll be able to get a job when I graduate. That concerns me a bit, but, not as much as it should.I am still liking the idea of an inn, but, it wouldn't be until at least 2014. At least. (Unless I win the lottery. Then all bets are off.)I look forward to Christmas break, both because I love Christmas time, and because it means I only have one more semester left. I may not be here all of the break; my choir may be touring DC and Pennsyltucky in January. Guitar was going well until I ran out of time and took a hiatus. However, I learned enough of the basics that I should be able to figure out the rest on my own. The basics are always my biggest problem.I quite glad I auditioned for the choir this year, and am very glad, but still curious as to how I made it. It gets me out, gives me something to work on, and gets my more interaction, which is always good for me. Usually.My job is okay. Sometimes its fine, but, sometimes it is really bad. Mainly because my boss is an itch with a b, and because suddenly we are assigned things that were not part of the original job description.I bought a really cute winter coat yesterday. It's red.Next semester's tentative schedule:MR 10-11:15- Operations and Production ManagementMR 11:30-12:45 - Ethics in BusinessTF 10-11:15- Stats Decision MakingTF 11:30-12:45 - New Venture Practicum 2TF 1-3:45- Basic Keyboard (and Lab)R 6:30-9:15 - Business PolicyKeyboard is what I'm most looking forward to, and is also the one that I will potentially not be able to take. Curse you, CBA, for not wanting to count my globalism course from Loyola!
