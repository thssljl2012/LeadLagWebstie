Pregnant customer forced into contractions.&amp;#0160; Does B of A care enough to arm/train its tellers?&amp;#0160; Teller pistol-whipped and had to get CAT scan.&amp;#0160; This story does avoid the term &amp;quot;rare&amp;quot; found in previous such stories.&amp;#0160; Also, the story judiciously avoids the term &amp;quot;gunmen,&amp;quot; using &amp;quot;robbers&amp;quot; instead.&amp;#0160; From OC Register:  At 9:13 a.m. Monday, the three men walked into the Bank of America in the 22000 block of El Toro Road in Lake Forest, in a small shopping center. &amp;quot;They came in saying, 'This is a robbery' and asked for a manager,&amp;quot; Amormino said. An assistant manager of the bank identified himself and one of the men grabbed him and pointed a handgun to the top of his head, Amormino said.  The three men ordered bank employees and five customers to the floor as one of them grabbed the assistant manager by the collar and moved him to the back of the bank, all the while holding the gun to his head,&amp;#0160;Amormino said. &amp;quot;He tried to get him to open the vault but was unsuccessful,&amp;quot; Amormino said.  The&amp;#0160;man then told the assistant manager to open a cash drawer and give him the money. A second man jumped over the counter and pointed a gun at a male and a female teller while telling them to take cash out from drawers. The&amp;#0160;man then hit the male teller, who is in 30s, in the head, Amormino said.  Meanwhile, the third&amp;#0160;man appeared to keep an eye out at the door of the bank. The customers remained on the floor during the course of the robbery,
