Appreciate Joe and Aaron,thanks for taking me to Barclays Singapore Open yesterday. I was absolute a super &amp;quot;cai niao&amp;quot; for golf. There do have a golf channel on TV between the espn and soccer. I just ignore it and switch between espn and soccer all the time and never expect myself have any relationship with golf. But i will say i start understand why golf have so many follower and fans. It is indeed a elegant sport which need very good skill and dertermination. . He-he, also, audience's cooperation is very important.They understand the stratagem and cheers for every good detail. It was a great basic golf education to me especially zero distance with some of most famous player around the world. 18 holes, every hole has different distance and design. Winner has to get the ball into the hole with fewest hit. The player need finish 4 rounds in 4 days. But around 50% player will be washed out after the first two days. Yesterday was the final day, attendance brought the weekend figure to 23,350. And finally, India player &amp;quot;Jeev Milkha Singh&amp;quot; win the first prize US$790,000. , see, i even can tell some names I never know before, Phil Mickelson, Padraid Harrington from Ireland, Adam Scott from Australia, South African Ernie Els......Glad to say, i start watching the golf channel without any force today. Ok, where is my cleek......
