I have said before on this blog, that we are in a "waiting period" where many of us know something big is about to happen, but we don't know when or WHAT it is! But isn't becoming frustrating all this waiting around?Many who have "the knowing" are now saying that what is coming is NOT 2012 but much sooner, possibly as early as next year, and we will all have to go through some really bad times ahead before we get to the higher consciousness and what some call "the new promised land".Others say we are about to be "contacted" by another race - but how many times have we heard that before? Am I becoming a little sceptical in my old age, or what?I cannot throw any light on WHAT it is that is about to happen, I wish I could, but like many others, I am convinced SOMETHING is already happening around us and leading up to something much bigger.I remain on a "life holding pattern" where I cannot move forward like many others until this next stage begins. In the meantime I am in a constant state of tiredness and feel in a CBA mood (Can't Be Arsed!) which is not helpful to MAKING things move forward lol!All I can say to the forces out there that are apparently channeling this info to people is - GET A MOVE ON!!Ross
