Asia's richest national Open offering a record US$5 million hosted by Sentosa Golf Club, was held last weekend on the Serapong Course. Defending champion Angel Cabrera was absent and Adam Scott, champion in 2005 and 2006 surprisingly didnt make the cut to the final rounds this year.  It was a privilege to be invited by Barclays at their hospitality pavilion with a spectacular view of the 9th and 18th hole.  Although my invitation was for the four day event, I only managed to watch the 3rd and final rounds of the tournament which was packed with excitement from the many upsets faced by the leaders as the final round began!View of the 18th hole from the Terrace of the PavilionBut for one man, the golfing gods was on his side. Scoring seven-under 277 with a one-stroke victory over Ernie Els and Padraig Harrington, Jeev Milkha Singh took home the Cup with his sixth win on the Asian Tour.  Adding the winning cheque of US$792,500 he received, Jeev surpassed his million-dollar mark in a single seasons earnings, a record for the Asian Tour and at the same time, sealing the Asian Tour Order of Merit title.Jeev Milkha Singh (Right in Pink) on the 9th hole with Padraig HarringtonIn an interview Jeev said, I'm a very fortunate man to win.  I think the "golfing gods" were on my side.  Yes I am golfed out and I didn't play well in the last two weeks.  I hit the ball pretty good this week and I think that helped my game." By the way did you know ~ each green is mowed 36 times during the Barclays Singapore Open so over four days that would mean 9 times a day!  "The most glorious moments in your life are not the so-called days of success, but rather those days when out of dejection and despair you feel rise in you a challenge to life, and the promise of future accomplishments." ~ Gustave Flaubert
