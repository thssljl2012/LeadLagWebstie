Im not sure if you can do this sign in the US, but in New Zealand, you can with our sense of humour: its at the New Orleans bar (formerly Paris), on Lambton Quay, Wellington. Two of the staff are Frenchmen so we chatted more about the fact that Orlans is a French town. You can even do a President Bush impersonation and say, I see the reconstructions fine, and you dont need my help, and not get nasty glances.                                                                                                                                                                                               New Orleans blackboard                                         This one at Get Funkd might be more universal though:                                                                                                                                                                                               Get Funk'd blackboard                                      We never found out if she did get fired. However, I did not know what to do with this one at the National Bank on Manners Street, Wellington:                                                                                                                                                                                               Modern segregation                                      The first time I was not sure about this. I thought it was some modern form of segregation. I went to the regular queue with them white and brown folk. When I got to the teller, I asked him if the bank expected Kazakhs, Iranians, Indians and Asiatic Russians to go with the Asian Banking sign. He was a bit humourless and it went over his head. But he did tell me that the staff were multilingual or spoke different dialects as I noted I did not speak Mandarin. I was welcome to go there next time. The second time I put this to the test. I figured that if the National Bank wanted all Asiansif you are one of the group descended from or related to the 37 billion from Asiato turn right and not left, and segregate us, I would go along with it. Plus the teller from the time before said the staff were multilingual. I went to ask if any of the Chinese staff (I did not see any Japanese, Kazakhs, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis or any others) if they spoke Cantonese. They did not. Therefore, I went to queue up with the regular folk. The Mandarin-speaking woman working there did come to ask if she could help me. I said I wanted a cheque cashed. She said I was in the right queue. I remarked that I was just following the signs about segregation because I didnt want to go all Rosa Parks-on-the-bus on them. (And the last time whites pulled this stunt with Chinese we got so pissed off that we brought down the Ching Dynasty in 1911, so bringing down a single bank is not too hard.) This time, my teller was (probably locally born) Chinese and could appreciate the nuances. She, like me, thought it was inappropriate for Chinese to be grouped with 37 billion people on the Asian continent. And we had very little in common with, say, the fictional Borat, who is from Asia. Or Emperor Hirohito. Or Gandhi. Or my friend Merrill Fernando who sells tea on TV. She said I was the first customer to have interpreted the sign as requesting Asians go to a separate part of the bank but she would raise it with the manager. I said that even the Chinese writing said Asian banking. But I still do not know what the sign means: clearly all Asians cannot be assisted because there are only Mandarin-speaking staff in that section of the bank. Clearly there, the services are specialized and regular banking is still with the regular tellers. This was deceptive advertising. I am so glad I have closed the majority of our ANZNationalPost Office Savings BankCountrywidewhatever-else-was-merged accounts. I dont understand this lack of logic and it demonstrates a massive absence of cultural awareness. (As a non-customer it is a great thing to have a laugh about and I hope they will leave it up as a relic!)  So they want Asians in another part of the bank but they dont. And they cant serve any Asians anyway unless you speak Mandarin, which is about 28 per cent of all Asians, but its pretty sweeping and arrogant to say all Asians should go that way. I do not know of any Chinese who would not find this sign either insulting, humorous, or stupid, which are probably three qualities that the National Bank wishes to convey. And I bet every other Asian, say folks from Tajikistan or Azerbaijan or Vietnam or India, are wondering why they cant get served in that section or why their languages arent included on the sign or by the Chinese staff. The sign should read, in Chinese, Specialized services for Mandarin-speaking customers which, believe it or not, would fit into the space they have anyway, and is probably what the bank means. Congratulations, National Bank, youre stupid in two languages. Which is better than being stupid in three:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Large Black Coffee from &amp;quot;Role Models&amp;quot;                                                 Read and post comments            Send to a friend
