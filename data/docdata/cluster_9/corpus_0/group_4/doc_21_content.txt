Posted by SMAZ on 11/17/2008 2:26:36 AM ESTDon't they still play the Final Four in regular basketball stadiums?  A few years ago the NCAA instituted a rule that the venue must have  a certain amount of capacity. MSG or Barclays Center would be too small. It's pretty much just big domed football-sized stadiums for the FF now.
