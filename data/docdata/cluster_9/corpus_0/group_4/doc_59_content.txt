from Larry Brooks of the NY Post,   The Rangers are seeking a compensatory selection in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft for the loss of Alexei Cherepanov, The Post has learned.   Glen Sather raised the issue at the general managers&amp;#8217; meeting in Chicago two weeks ago, citing CBA Article 8.3 (b) that stipulates that compensatory picks be awarded to teams unable to sign first-round draft picks.   Sather is submitting that the Rangers should receive the 17th selection in the second round of June&amp;#8217;s draft as compensation for losing Cherepanov, the 17th overall selection in the 2006 Draft who died in Russia on Oct. 13 while playing for Omsk.   &amp;#8220;At this point, the league has taken no position on the Rangers&amp;#8217; request,&amp;#8221; NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly told The Post. &amp;#8220;The matter is in front of the league&amp;#8217;s general managers, who will address the subject at their next meeting in March.   continued
