     i've been anxious about this new contract i just got. i should have blogged from the start. i should have talked about how anxious i was about the interview and how enoch and i had fought just the day before i had arrived at the interview distraught with grief. And how they gave me the job because i was so emotionally spent i couldn't impress anyone and be any more competent that i was that morning. i should have blogged about how anxious i was working with Bank of America that i drove up to the city a week before for a meeting that was scheduled a week later. How i needed to see templates and that was exactly what i got that day, a lovely tour from an easy-going boss who has twins in kindergarten. i should have mentioned how anxious i was at the kick-off meeting about how i was going to integrate my process-less startup interaction design experience into the hugely process, rules, and guideline-d work of corporate. How i worried through the whole one hour meeting and how ultimately, i had a micro-managing lead who is also an ID himself and wants to do "all the work" and have me be in a supportive role. i almost wept with relief. i should have blogged about how my manager called up apologetic and sensitive asking " How am i feeling" i almost dropped the phone about the change in roles and responsibilities. How only God knew that that was the perfect set up for me to feel comfortable working with corporate as a contractor.i should have mentioned how the agency is so supportive, so clear, so "orientation centered", so set up for me to succeed that they spent an hour on a conference call going over process.i should have .... because then i will know, that God who got me the gig, is the only one that will see me through and it's not by might nor by power but by his spirit.
