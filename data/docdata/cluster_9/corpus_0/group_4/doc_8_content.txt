Bank of America building, from 6th Avenue to the northBank of America building from 42nd to the westBank of America building from Bryant ParkThe soon to be completed Bank of America Tower, billed as One Bryant Park although it sits across 42nd street, diagonally, from Bryant Park may or may not be the second tallest building in the city.It stands either 945 feet tall or 1,200 feet tall, depending on how it is being measured (street to roof or street to top of spire).  It has 52 floors and had 2.2 million square feet of space.  Per wiki, "[i]t is debatable as to whether what is being called an "architectural spire"[10] will count toward the structural height. Currently, the New York Times Building and the Chrysler Building are tied for the position of the third tallest buildings in New York City."   Wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America_Tower_(New_York) and this site: http://www.siteselection.com/ssinsider/snapshot/sf040816.htm give more information about this remarkable Green building.  PBS had an airing on Thursday night of a show regarding green building which featured the BOA tower.  I then noticed it in the skyline from the train Friday morning, and took these snaps from the i-phone during lunch on my way back from Carnegie Hall.
