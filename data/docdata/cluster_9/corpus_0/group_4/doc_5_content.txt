bully in a china shop.i wont work my ass off at a shitty job for 2 weeks.to hand it all over to you.one more small katching in your big, well oiled money making machine.like a sheep prey to a wolf waiting in the grass.if you were a dog, they should have drowned you at birth.don't infect me with your poison.we will have peace.we will have peace.when you hang from a gibbet at your window for the sport of your own crows.i would love nothing more than to tie you to the stake and watch you burn in hell while your family watched in horror as your eye balls bubbled and popped and your skin cracked and curled.and in this crippled, fucked view, maybe before it's over, you will see clearly and correctly as your children cry and lovers beg for mercy before the end. and you find your castle stood upon sand and you watch it all come crumbling down upon you.then we will have peace. i will not lick your fingers.opportunist.liar.doppelganger.shape shifter.child killer.money grabber.vote rigger.briber taker.mother fucker."Ralph: I do want to take the opportunity to thank you for being a valued Bank of America customer. We appreciate your business."go rot.
