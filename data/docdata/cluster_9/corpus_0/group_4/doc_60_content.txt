Y'know, I spent ages trying to work out where I'd heard that in a song.And I'm ashamed at myself for only just having come to the conclusion it's from Defying Gravity.XDDDDBut, in other news, my bedroom is tidyy.My bag is all packed for uni/college/whatever it is I do tomorrow!And I&amp;nbsp;SHOULD&amp;nbsp;BE&amp;nbsp;GETTING&amp;nbsp;MY&amp;nbsp;LAPTOP!That statement right there is key to how my day will end.If I get the laptop, all things will be right in the universe.Angels will sing, devils will dance, and everybody in the middle can have a party.If not, and it doesn't get here ANYTIME this week.Things will go horribly wrong for someone, somewhere.Either that, or they'll be going uber right for someone, as the world is a topsy-turvy place.My radiator can go back on my wall today, too. :33333It's been f-ing freezing in my room since it's been off the wall.BRR.But now, warmth shall return to my life. :DI'm getting my lip pierced for Christmas!WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.I feel like I should devote a whole blog post to that point, but I actually cba.XDMum's buying me the lip piercing I want for Christmas!So, at the beginning of December, expect to see a new friend on my face!&amp;nbsp;:DEeh, I'm really excited.x3Mm, I think that's about it as blog worthy things for today go.Even though that was more of a short recount of today's boring events.My hands are awfully dry.. :(Maybe I'll treat myself to a tattoo at Christmas.
