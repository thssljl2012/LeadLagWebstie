I have a tendency to make things up as I go along when I&amp;#8217;m in the kitchen. Sometimes I peruse recipes to get inspiration. Sometimes I even follow one, although it seems to bother me if I follow it to the letter; I have this perverse need to change things around. Or maybe it&amp;#8217;s just that I generally CBA (can&amp;#8217;t be arsed) to make a special trip to pick up the proper things so I make it work with what&amp;#8217;s on hand. That said, I seem to be recreating the same recipe a few times so I thought I&amp;#8217;d put it down for posterity. I call it &amp;#8220;Pseudo quiche&amp;#8221; because it doesn&amp;#8217;t have any dough layer. I have done quiche with both sweet and savory doughs and it&amp;#8217;s yummy either way, but that layer really isn&amp;#8217;t necessary! So here goes! Pseudo-Quiche Ingredients  veggies that need eating eggs cream (optional) cheese sea salt spices (nutmeg, dill)  Saute the veggies in olive oil. Today I used zucchini, mushrooms, arugula and broccoli. Put the sauteed veggies into a baking pan. Scramble eggs and cream. Add in salt and spices.  Chop up some of your favorite cheese (today I used raw sharp cheddar).   Put the cheese on top. Bake at 425F for 20 min.
