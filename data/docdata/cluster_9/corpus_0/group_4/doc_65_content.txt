It's official: the employee ID once owned by former Lehman Brothers guard dog Bella, who has passed on since being laid off from by Barclays, sold for $810 in our little auction.  We were going to give the proceeds to laid off Brothers and Sisters but the peanut gallery decided it would prefer the money be donated to some sort of canine charity, and we've obliged. We'll be sending a check to the Animal Medical Center.  Two things.
