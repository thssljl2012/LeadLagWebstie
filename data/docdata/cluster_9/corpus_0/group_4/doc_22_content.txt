The Big Lead    The sports blog's interview with the Newark paper's hoops reporter inevitably comes around to the Nets' future plans.       Q: Will the Nets ever make it to Brooklyn? The delays have us thinking no. If thats the case, then do you think LeBron stays in Cleveland, or winds up with the Knicks? Or can you imagine him playing in New Jersey? Is there even a darkhorse for his services, or is he the type who bigger-than-sports star must be in one of the NBAs major markets, like LA, Chicago, or NY?        The political momentum is such that there may be no turning back at this point, and the linchpin in this deal  sharp guy named Brett Yormark  asserts that the financing is there, and that his partners are content to see it through. Even Barclays, which actually turned down Gordon Browns handout, seems to be hanging in there. Maybe thats just a company line, but the signs are that theyre still going to break ground. . . . uh, some time in the coming century.     article    Atlantic Yards Report, Listening to Yormark: sports reporter says Brooklyn deal is a go    Norman Oder throws a little cold water on D'Alessandro's assertion, considering the source of his info.       While I agree that the "Atlantic Yards is dead" meme is way overstated, I also think anything Yormark says should be taken with a grain of salt. After all, he's the guy who last year said the arena would break ground in the fall of 2007 and open in 2009.     And of course, there's chatter on Nets Daily: Dave D. on Brooklynand New Jersey
