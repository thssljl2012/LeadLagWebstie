   dallas in lights, originally uploaded by findblancomeow.     some people in an apartment down the street from me used xmas lights to depict the dallas skyline. super cute! i wish their was a red pegasus though.this pic is obviously inexcusably blurry, but you can see the green of the bank of america building much better than in the other photo i took, and i think that really adds to the charm.i'm totally stealing this idea for next year. even if i don't have a street-facing window.*ben kweller wrote that line of the song 'falling' about flying into dallas from new york and seeing the tacky green BofA building just before landing. how sweet. whenever i heard that song before i would always picture the neon sign for trees in deep ellum. back, ya know, when trees still existed. sigh.  ...
