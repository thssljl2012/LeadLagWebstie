I met Nathan at a CARES trade show at my friend's complex. Right off, from the moment I met him, I could tell that he was a very interesting person and was very excited to photograph him. We set up a time and here's what came of it!He is a banker with Bank of America and enjoys the arts and loves the city of Dallas. He was such a pleasure to get to know and to spend that time with. Thanks Nathan for letting me photograph you!Thanks for looking!
