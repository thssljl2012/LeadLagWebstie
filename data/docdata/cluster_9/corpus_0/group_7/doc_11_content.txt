It appears that it's down to brass tacks now for the Steelers front office in terms of contract negotiations. Numbero uno on every radar is the goal of extending the contract of resident superhero linebacker, James Harrison. Given the variables of Harrison's potential worth, his age, the CBA murkiness and the tightness under the cap, these negotiations will prove to be very taxing for gurus Kevin Colbert and Omar Khan. With Bryant McFadden and Nate Washington almost surely out the door, it's evident that the team is focused on finding enough loot for Harrison and guard Chris Keomatu. Here are some of the events that seem to be essential over the next few weeks if the Steelers are to get their way:Work out a long term deal for "franchise" guy Max Starks. This will reduce Starks' cap hit from around $8 million for 2009 to about $3 million.Re-structure Hines Ward's 2005 deal. This will lower the 2009 cap figures and ensure that #86 stays under contract thru 2011.Re-work or cut Larry Foote. (hate saying this, since he's one of my favorites)...He's become expendable with Timmons surging.
