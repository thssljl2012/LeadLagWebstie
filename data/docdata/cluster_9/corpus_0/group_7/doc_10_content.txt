The Panthers are playing hardball with Julius Peppers.After placing the franchise tag on their star defensive end Thursday, general manager Marty Hurney stuck with the most strict description of the rights of a franchise player:Hurney said the Panthers placed a non-exclusive franchise tag on Peppers, which gives him the right to seek contract offers from another team. As a result, Peppers can bring the Panthers an offer sheet and the Panthers would have the right to either match the offer and keep Peppers under a multi-year deal, or receive two first-round picks as compensation from the other team.The Panthers decided against placing an exclusive franchise tag on Peppers, which would have prevented him from going elsewhere.Under the terms of the CBA, we designated him and he can go out and talk to teams about an offer sheet, said Hurney. We can match. Weve also said many times how much we value Julius and we would like him to play here.Hurney wouldnt speculate on whether the Panthers would be willing to accept anything less than two first-round picks for Peppers.The franchise tag is the franchise tag, he said. With it, go those rules.-- Charles Chandler
