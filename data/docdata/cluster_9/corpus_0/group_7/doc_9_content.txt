&#8230;stealing your bandwidths. So I&#8217;ve moved again. This time into a studio in Newtown. It feels like the biggest place I have lived in purely because it has the biggest room. It is only one room, however. It does have an awesome balcony. Currently I have a set of mags sitting out there waiting for a set of tyres. Plus it has a cool parking spot. I am going to check out the pub this weekend. &#8216;The&#8217; pub being the closest pub (20m) out of the dozen or so within walking distance. Of course, I have already been to this pub many times. But now it is my local. I&#8217;ll need to figure out what is good on the food menu. Then I can tell people, &#8220;Oh, well the tandori tofu bean salad is fuckin the shiznit.&#8221; Or more likely &#8220;Sick burgers.&#8221; &#8220;&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;No, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve tried.&#8221;  I ordered an iPhone. Yes, I am a slut for middle class technology. That and giant robots. Speaking of which&#8230; Michael Bay, you CBA-ad appearing mofo. You&#8217;d better not stuff up Transformers with some giant unicycle shit. I&#8217;ll fuckin lynch ur facebooks like ur an arsonist.  I got pre-approval for a home loan. I have not got pre-approval for being an adult. I am testing out the studio vibe somewhat. I&#8217;ve got a steady job you see. It is all coming together&#8230; That or I buy an R32 GTR. I am still figuring out what to do with this blog. I used it to think through problems. Now I face problems and I have little control over how I tackle them. I am a worker stooge. I accept my fate with the same knowingness that all workers have. I am scanning eBay for an excercise bike as it is time to stop drinking mojitos and get out of the pool to come home from my vacation in the land of fat.
