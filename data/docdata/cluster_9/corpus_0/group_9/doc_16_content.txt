TORONTO - Calgary Flames' forward Andre Roy has been suspended for one game and fined $2,500 (the maximum allowed under the CBA) as a result of an incident in the pregame warm-up last night when he initiated contact with Chicago Blackhawks' defenseman Aaron Johnson.      Roy's suspension will be served on Saturday night when the Flames meet the Blackhawks in Game Five of the series.  http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=419768Does anyone know what happened?
