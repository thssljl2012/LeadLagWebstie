 Pax Arcana Astronomers say they have located a so-called &#8220;space blob&#8221; they call Himiko that is 12.9 billion light years from Earth and possesses characteristics that confuse their ideas of the big bang and stuff. Yes, this story is only interesting because they call it a &#8220;space blob.&#8221; That&#8217;s funny. Anyway, the space blob is confounding because scientists would expect an object that large (it&#8217;s about the size of a galaxy) to be much older than the blob appears to be: A range of possibilities could explain the massive nature of Himiko: it could have a supermassive black hole at its centre, or perhaps it is a single giant galaxy with a large mass of about 40 billion Suns. So this thing is the size of an entire galaxy and is 12.9 billion light years away and has the mass of about 40 billion Suns? Boy that makes me feel insignificant. But then I remember that one time that Citibank told me I was a valued customer and that my call was important to them, and suddenly I feel much better. &#8216;Space blob&#8217; baffles astronomers [BBC]  Tagged: astronomy, Himiko, space blob
