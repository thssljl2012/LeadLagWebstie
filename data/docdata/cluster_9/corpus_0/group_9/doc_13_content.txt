I keep meaning to update this, but don&#8217;t have time. First off, I organised for Kathto come and see the &#8216;Owlers dogs last weekend. She&#8217;s a chiro, as I&#8217;ve posted about before, and she came to see the dogs lastAugust. Leanne wanted her dogs looking at, Emma wanted Bailey seen and I wanted Jetto be checked, sowe thought it would be sensible for her to come to the club, as she&#8217;d never fit us all in at Rotherham. A few more members were interested and afterJane giving me a slight panic about what happened if it rained (Ishould reall thinkthese things through,although eventually came up with the idea of our magic yellow tent!) everything went well. Jet was fine again, she really loves Kath, possinly because everytime she gets to see her she has a cuddle with her atflyball, I&#8217;m lucky to drag her away a lot of the time. Chip was also fine, so we have some sound doggies. Kath also said Jetfelt brilliant, and she was a very well conditioned doggy. Ahhh. We went to agility last night, and we have developed sever weaving woes (all on Ruffdogs, cba explaining again!). Her turns were lovely though, she way she was responding to me was excellent. I reallyenjoyed running her, she&#8217;s such a sweetie. I bought 3 ofChris Zink&#8217;s books too, they are so good!!
