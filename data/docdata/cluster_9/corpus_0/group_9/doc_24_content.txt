     Here is the latest from the KDF on the Balloon Glow for tonight.....  The U.S. Bank Derby Festival Great Balloon Glow IS EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE AT 9 PM TONIGHT at the Kentucky Exposition Center. Due to ever-changing weather conditions  mainly winds  the event may be modified from its traditional format. Depending on conditions this evening, the Glow may feature a combination of balloons inflating with propane and burning against the night sky, cold-air balloon inflation (no glow from burners) and a Puff and Fluff (balloon envelope not fully inflated).     Please note: Safety conditions at the time of the event will determine whether attendees will be allowed onto the balloon field at the Expo Center. (A safety-firstdecision will be made on site at the event and communicated to attendees.) Winds in excess of 12 to 14 miles an hour could restrict the format of the traditional glow. Admission to the U.S. Bank Great Balloon Glow is a 2009 Pegasus Pin. The parking fee at KEC is $6.
