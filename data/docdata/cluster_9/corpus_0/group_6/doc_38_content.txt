I haven&#8217;t been posting over the last few days, mainly because at my employ, they decided to give people the opportunity to work overtime. Which I did. I went in at 8am (rather than 9am), for the past 3 days. Eventually I gave in because, a) I was one of 3 out of a workforce of 14 who decided to do it, and b) working from 8 until 5 was beginning to send me a bit doo-lally. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m getting the beginnings of a cold. I can feel it. I didn&#8217;t feel much better yesterday neither, when my TL had to virtually re-write a letter for me because I was, quite frankly, slightly brain-dead, and was really lucky to string a couple of sentences together between 4pm and 5pm. I think at one stage I used the word &#8220;sleepdrive&#8221;, but I can&#8217;t be too sure. So, a mixture of &#8220;CBA (can&#8217;t be arsed) syndrome&#8221; and also being plain dog-tired, means I&#8217;m going in at my normal time tomorrow. Oh, just forgot We are lucky to have a &#8220;restaurant&#8221; (not subsidised), and I ordered a sausage barm this morning. It&#8217;s breakfast after all. But it&#8217;ll be good going back toa plain old home-made breakfast (usually toast and maybe a hot drink).
