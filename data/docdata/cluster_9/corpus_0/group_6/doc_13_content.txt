             HOLY SHIT I GOT A JOB!Yesterday was my 40th birthday and I had a job interview (the only one I've had) and he hired me on the spot! It was awesome! It's a huge relief and couldn't come at a better time. It's a contract position, which means no benefits. I'm not counting my chickens before they hatch and that means I need to sign a contract before I can breathe easy. I have to pass the background check. It's always something.And it sounds like Countrywide/Bank of America/Evil Empire/corporate bloodsucking shitbags are willing to play ball with us and work with us on the mortgage. Keep your fingers crossed.Many thanks to my awesome big brother for the positive vibes! You've got some powerfuljuju!
