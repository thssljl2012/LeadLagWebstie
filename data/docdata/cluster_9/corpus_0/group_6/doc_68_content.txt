So another afternoon/evening of walking downtown to grab a bite and a brew at Howiee's and then do some photos.  I really like the dusk/dawn setting on the camera for capturing hues in the low light.  Click on any of these thumbnails to go to the photostream and see bigger images;)We started off walking down past brother_rat's alma mater South Medford High.  The pic is not up as it was not all that great.  But just down the street is a computer repair shop that has a really great logo in the window.Here is the back patio at Howiee's showing the green backside of the Woolworth Building and the ugly 70's architecture of the US Bank building behind the bar's lit up patio.This is the Elks Building and really a great example of that Beaux Arts style built in 1913.  I was fortunate to catch the setting sun gleaming on the clock face at the top corner of the building.This is the old train depot which is now Porter's Restaurant.  We thought about going there for my birthday dinner until I saw their menu online and the appetizers start at like $18 so um. . . no I don't think so.  Still is cool to look at in the evening when it's all lit up although this pic is a bit blurry.Ah, the ubiquitous Woolworth Building which I think is just a prerequisite for any town of decent size that's been around since 1900.Ok, this one of those 50's "Moderne" or California style buildings that remind me of old matchbooks and swizzle sticks from that lounge era;)  And tonight we are off to Jackson Creek Pizza Co. in downtown to see ednoled at the open mic!  Yay!
