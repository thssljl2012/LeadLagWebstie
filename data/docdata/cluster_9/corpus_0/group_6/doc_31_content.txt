       Doubledown Media put itself on the block today, as was noted in a teensie weensie article in the New York Post written by "Teri Buhl" (that's quite the nom de plume!).The Reaper had this one called in June, and then when Lehman Brothers went belly up in September, they watched their readership join the unemployment line in droves. It didn't help, of course, to be the first in line of people owed money by Lenny "Nails" Dykstra.Who is going to buy Doubledown Media? Most of their controlled circulation list is probably filled with people out of a job. Would Bank of America or Wells Fargo decide this was a marketing tool worth investing a few dimes in? My guess in Doubledown Media really goes "down" within the next 45 days.
