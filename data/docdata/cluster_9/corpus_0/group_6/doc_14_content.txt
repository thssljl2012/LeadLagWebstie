[Guest post by DRJ] It&#8217;s Friday and the economic news is not good.   California can&#8217;t send out tax refunds until February.  Bank of America needs another bailout to help cover its Merrill Lynch liabilities, making it the Bank owned by America.   Circuit City has given up its efforts to reorganize and is liquidating 567 stores.  Hertz and Conoco announced layoffs, and the list could go on.  In fact, I think it will go on for the next 12-18 months. Still &#8230; it&#8217;s Friday and I&#8217;m mellow and not inclined to think about the economy, politics, war, law, or the like.  So that leaves Austin cat-blogging. Ever wonder why they say &#8220;Keep Austin Weird&#8221;?  Maybe because you could see a guy riding a bike with a cat on his back: &#8220;I saw you on the sidewalk this morning. You were riding your bike east on Barton Springs Road. You were listening to an iPod. You had a cat on your back. It was a gray cat with a fluffy tail and a pink leash around its neck. It was draped across your right shoulder. I think you probably know that, though. I was amazed. That cat looked so content as you rode right next to four lanes of traffic. How  HOW?  did you get your cat to do that??&#8221; It might even be this guy, unless there&#8217;s another Austin guy with a cat on his back:  Photo by Rebecca Sikes, Austin Chronicle. The economy may be bad but life is good, don&#8217;t you think? &#8211; DRJ
