 At least former Lakers/Heat PG Smush Parker hung around the NBDL long enough to visit Austin. Last week, the Monitor&#8217;s Todd Mavreles reported Parker had left the Rio Grande Vipers to sign with Guandong of the Chinese Basketball Association. You know, the CBA that Isiah Thomas didn&#8217;t drive into the ground. Having attended last week&#8217;s D-League Showcase in Orem, Utah, ESPN.com&#8217;s Marc Stein seems to have been an eyewitness to the incident that sent Parker to China&#8217;s richest province. Living up to his reputation for being less than manageable, Parker reacted angrily when Vipers coach Clay Moser summoned him to the bench after Smush picked up two quick fouls in the first quarter. Instead of considering the possibility that Moser was trying to increase his chances of being around to play in the fourth quarter, Smush came to the conclusion that former Magic, Kings and Warriors scout was trying to impress the NBA types in the stands with his coaching acumen. The bickering and angry glances continued throughout Rio Grande&#8217;s 102-78 loss to the Reno Bighorns, all of which was hard to miss in such an empty, quiet gym.
