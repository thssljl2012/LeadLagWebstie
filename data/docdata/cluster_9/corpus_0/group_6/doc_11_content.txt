Dave at neoHOUSTON shared a recap of a walking tour of the Historic Sixth ward today, it sounded pretty cool..."Overall, it was a fantastic tour, and it was well worth $10. Starting next month, if you walk, ride your bike, or take public transportation to the tour, you receive a $2 discount. And members of GHPA  only have to pay $7 per tour. I highly recommend going to the next  walking tour on February 15th at 2pm, which will meet downtown outside  the Bank of America building and will cover 20th architecture along  Main Street."You guys might enjoy reading his post: http://neohouston.wordpress.com/2009/01/14...ric-sixth-ward/
