I didn't mention yet here cause I didn't want to jinx myself and only 4 ppl knew about it. Sooooooooo.....I start my new job on Thurs!!!!!!!!!I had two job interviews last week: one for Ricoh (printing company) and the other for Aviall (an aviation company that is right across the street where I worked for Amazon). They had me fill out the paperwork and do the pee tests and basically go from there. Whoever called me first saying I got the job, I was going to take it. And Ricoh called me this morning. If none of these worked out, I still had my Bank of America job still open but it was taking forever with them since they were still waiting for their machines to come in. I was going to be working 3rd shift on their insert machines. But now I'll be working 1st for Ricoh so that'll give me time to use my evenings for my schooling once I get all of that taken care of.Thanx to all who has given me encouragement and patience with the whole shitty job situation. It really helped me through my bad moments when I didn't think it was going to work out for me.
