It&amp;#8217;s 12 days to my 18th. And i really don&amp;#8217;t want to turn 18. : ( I feel liek I haven&amp;#8217;t acheived anything at the age of 18. And I&amp;#8217;ve heard of millions of people achieving great things at the age of 16. I don&amp;#8217;t know why but the whole &amp;#8216;18&amp;#8242; thing is really getting me scared :( I like being 17, seventeen is young, immature and implies without much responsibility. Now, eighteen is a different matter. With 18, you turn legal. You can buy your own cigarettes, drinks, and drive. (preferably not all 3 at the same time) With 18, you have to switch your YouthSaver account to a different one and be charged fees now if you withdraw over the limit (Commonwealth bank users, you get me!)  Besides my point, with 18 most people will start going to college or university, moving to a new city for higher education, and living independently. SO, i guess i should start a list (haha i love lists ) PROS  DRIVE! Buy alcohol, cigarettes, etc I can enter pubs! :P CASINO! I can play paintball! sound mature (lol)  move away from mum : P start college  CONS  to drive, which means i have to actually start taking lessons :P I&amp;#8217;m a terrible driver by the way. Not so bad with AUTO but real horrible with manual :P I don&amp;#8217;t smoke and I don&amp;#8217;t often drink. Entering pubs.. hmm. Not too bad : ) Casino? I&amp;#8217;m not much of a gambler Paintball might come in handy some day but I&amp;#8217;ve never played Haha, I&amp;#8217;m not mature at all :P  Moving away from mum means i gotta cook and save : ( Saving bit is okay, i&amp;#8217;m pretty good at saving but unless your definition of cooking is burnt, scorched food then I&amp;#8217;m an excellent cook. Starting college is always great except it&amp;#8217;s going to be terrifying at the same time. because it means making new friends, moving into the city, adjusting to the city.  (Incase you don&amp;#8217;t already realize this, I&amp;#8217;m just ranting ) But really, Since J&amp;#8217;s leaving pretty early, I&amp;#8217;m kinda looking forward to moving into the city now. Except I&amp;#8217;m really going to miss country air, skies and scenery : ( Not so much the town or the people. But I can&amp;#8217;t move into the city till Mid-Feb because my brother is looking for a place for us to stay (a cheaper place) and I&amp;#8217;ve got work here, so mean while staying here is good cos i get to work and earn a bit of money before moving over. : ) Which brings me to my next point, J&amp;#8217;s having a farewell BBQ tonight and I can&amp;#8217;t go cos I have work. But, I&amp;#8217;ll probably drop by after. Anyway, i think I&amp;#8217;m going up with his family and him when they leave on friday : ) ( i think)  Ok I&amp;#8217;m done ranting. Cya : ) *flickr*
