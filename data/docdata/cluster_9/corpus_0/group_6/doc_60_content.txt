No I'm not working as a banker. I'm still in the janitorial position. But instead of pulling trash and spot sweeping, I'm now using chemicals to clean up bathrooms. I'll tell you one thing..it's alot easier to learn bathroom cleaning.But not so easy finding my way around right now. I gotta go on not one, but two elevators. Here's the only complant I have with this job....there's no office for the employees, no table for us to eat. We have to sit at the entrace of the boss' small ass office on chairs and put our coats on coatracks. There's only one AC outlet in that entrance, and I'm afraid of having JP (my laptop) sitting out there being charged up. I'll still take it with me, but I'll only use it on a limited basis...just because I got nothing to do while waiting for my shift to start. No the XOHM network will not work in there...it's underground.The co-workers there..I have a feeling I may not make any friends with them. And none of them are below the age of 26 with the exception of the boss' psychonut son. I'm not gonna get into why because Jill or Jenn will say something about it. &lt;_&lt;  Look I'm not saying my boss is horrible...she's a nice person. It's just she's forced to have a small ass office and we don't have a place to sit and eat. I blame the people running the building for this.   So other than that, I got a short ass easy job. 4 hours of day, $6.70 an hour which is mininum wage in this city, and if I like what I'm doing...why walk away from it?  *yawn* Oh boy...I just walked in the snow to santoni's again. I needed to get some can goods, cat food, and some other things. Tommorrow I need to get some more items...but just for 2 days not for myself but for my father. Don't worry, he gave me money for it.
