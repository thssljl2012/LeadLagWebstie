Wow, been over a year since my last post.  Huh, might try updating this thing more.  Really bored at work right now, for those of you who may not know, I'm no longer at WaMu, I switched over to Bank of America.  It's alright I guess, it's a thing where the grass is always greener on the other side.  They are a lot more lax in some of their rules, but a lot more micromangey which kinda drives me a wee bit crazy.  That and my assitant manager kinda drives me (rest of the branch included) a little bonkers.Christmas was good, it was nice to spend time with the family.  I don't know maybe I'm just getting older or something but this year didn't really feel like christmas.  Probably because it felt like the year flew by.  Ahh well, New Years was fun as well, although I did contract a stomach flu midway through the night.  That was always fun, LoL.  It was nice to see everyone though.  Been a little of a homebody as of late.Other then that not too much is going on, finally got on Xbox live.  Our handle is MorboDisagress.  I found it entertaining, so yeah, still bored, still gotta be here till 7.  :)
