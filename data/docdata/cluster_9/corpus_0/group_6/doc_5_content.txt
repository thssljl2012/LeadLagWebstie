Im currently watching No Reservations with Anthony Bourdain in HD, yeah!!!  With luck, I just go home just in time to see him travel in Mexico and with better luck, to see him on the streets eating tacos.  (I came home from buying some running shoes.  I knew there was a reason I needed to buy them today. I will explain soon).  These are just generic images of tacos.  The ones I eat have an angelic glow to them.I think the nearby church has a stained glass window of the tacos.  I seek those authentic tacos, not those Americanized tacos or those gourmet tacos.  I speak of those delicious tacos in those small tortillas.  Now I am extremely hungry.  I want some tacos.   I'm posting a bulletin right now...Done.     So I'm thinking to go to Tapatia on Bristol and First St.   I really have not found a place just as good.  I've gone to several places in my lifetime... All 8,000 establishments here in Santa Ana.  I remember it all started when I was young.  There were several places... Tacos Serrano, now Gammy's Cafe.  I have no idea why its a cafe when it looks like a regular taqueria.  I remember that their tacos were slightly different from the others in Santa Ana.  Most do not include cabbage in their regular tacos.  That is what stood out at that place...  You cannot mention tacos without it's mobile predecessors, the taco truck.I even remember this one time where the Bank of America used to be on Main and Civic Center.  Where that Performing Arts building is.  Near Pop's Cafe?  There was a taco truck there at 8:30pm.  I actually stopped there to eat dinner there.  I'm a very indulgent man.  They ridicule me for my hunger, but...                                And it's next to a Bank of America.I am inspired...Taco Haiku:                                         The taco truck folklore                                          I am not afraid of you                                           Healthy and content    Thank you...  So my frequented taco trucks are behind the Pep Boys on First and Main.  The other one is south on Main near the "R" ranch market.  Where they sell social security and green cards.  (True, ask Danny and Jonathan).  It is where I had my first ceviche.  It was more than 15 years ago...  :::Crying:::     So I am looking for a taco place that is just as good.  The one thing I do miss about my old French St. house is there is no honking of the air horn in this neighborhood.  There are no elotes or tamales being sold.  No raspados, fruit, chicharones.... nothing...  Am I spelling this correctly???  I am too heartbroken to research the spelling.                  I couldn't find one with a classic shopping cart.  Those are the best. I will now go on my quest...                                              Searching for the taste                                           Is it like happiness?                                            Never to be found.I want a taco now....
