James Adams wonders whether we need two BookExpo events when everyone really kind of doesn&#8217;t like even the one. This more than doubles the number of BookExpo events I&#8217;ll be missing this year over last year. That&#8217;s right, I was negative BookExpo events last year. Authors, agents, publishers and booksellers like to point fingers at each other, blaming one or the other or combinations thereof for the woes of the publishing industry. But there&#8217;s always been one thing, it seems, that all parties can unanimously bemoan and that&#8217;s BookExpo Canada. The annual national trade show/convention/schmoozerama for the country&#8217;s book industry, BookExpo has been around since the early 1950s. It&#8217;s almost always held in Toronto, usually for three or four days in mid-to-late June. Once called the Canadian Booksellers Association convention (CBA for short), British-headquartered Reed Exhibition Companies took over its ownership and organization in 2000, and in 2001 gave it the BookExpo moniker (to both distinguish it and tie it in with its U.S. counterpart BookExpo America). Reed has relentlessly zigged and zagged ever since to accommodate BookExpo&#8217;s critics, with mixed results, and it&#8217;s doing so again this year. In fact, for 2009, it&#8217;s hoping to host two big events  a trade show, to be held June 19 to 22 in Toronto and targeted almost exclusively to industry players, and a book fair, also in Toronto, but open to book lovers and fans of all ages, with lots of interactive and fun-filled activities and notable literary celebrities. Details are to be announced today and it&#8217;s anticipated the fair will run over a weekend in early October, likely at an indoor venue on the Canadian National Exhibition grounds.
