Presenting my New Cup for 2009 onwardsRead On.. Finally dumped my CCKSS cup which i've been using for almost 13yrs.. abit "" but have to throw to show my mum I also can throw my things...found alot of things during spring cleaning which she dun use but reluctant to throw...grr...Goodbye my CCKSS Cup, I will miss u...Hello my new cup, from now on, u will serve meGroup photo of the old and newNow for some grumblings...Been thinking of the "kiasu-ism" in SG, i.e. Aunties who stand right in the middle of MRT doors and rush in as soon as the door open, cope-ing seats with tissues ...etc...but then think of it, kiasu-ism is actually not a bad thing if u use it in the good way. I wonder why SG people always try to outdo each other in the $$/status sense but when dun they try to outdo each other in the "good act" area. Like comparing how many good deeds u've done today, who got a better character.. etc... if this can materialise, u will see people fighting to give up their seats for old people in MRT.. haha.. but i guess all those kiasu=competitive are crap la.... why dun they "compete" to be better people? that's why i say sometimes things we say/do really make us slap ourselves in the mouth... hahaFinally cleared my credit card bills for the santa's month... OMG, the bills come up to a whopping $1700++ (usu every mth only $200-300) for all my credit cards... dunno wat i spent on too... KaoZ... luckily this mth, managed to get some $$ from SAF + a freelance project... else may have to touch my savings liao... Then even made a mistake and paid $28 lesser to CitiBank last mah and i kena slapped with a  $40 (late payment) + $16.62 (interest) wahhh... luckily they are still humane enough to waive off this seemingly absurd amount else really scold them and cancel their service liao.From this mth onwards, cannot spend so much liao ...SAVE SAVE SAVE!
