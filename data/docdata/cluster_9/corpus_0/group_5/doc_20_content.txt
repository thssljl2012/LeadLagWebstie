Hello my lovelies!I hope everyone had a great Christmas.  I had a great Texmas, as I spent the Holiday at home in Houston. =)   It was a nice visit.  I was able to see my family whom I haven't seen in a while, and I also got to see my best friend Keith!  Woohoo!So I'm here now in Atlanta.  Unfortunately, Bank of America is feeling the economic woes and is doing what they have to do to stay on top.  Therefore, hours have been cut  OH so drastically, putting me with less than half of what I am used to.  Needless to say,   my hunt for an evening/weekend PT job is in full force.  What a hideous feeling. =(2008 is almost over, I can't believe it.  All in all, I've had an amazing year, despite my current financial foolishness.  I have the best group of friends ever, and I still love my job and my coworkers to bits.  Now that I'm in a loving relationship, it adds to my happiness.  (I still can't get over the fact that I'm back with my ex.)    When we're out and about, I still introduce him to my friends as the ex boyfriend, lol.  Having a second chance with Ry2 feels like a gift, because looking back on the first time I wish that I would have enjoyed it more, as I took him for granted.So anywho, New Years should be fun.  I haven't made any set plans yet, but I'm sure that my friends and I will have a great time whatever it is that we do.Anywho.....Happy New Years!!!!!- RYAN!
