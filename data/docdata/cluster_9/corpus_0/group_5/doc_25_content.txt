Yes that&amp;#8217;s right, the day has yet again crept into my life. It&amp;#8217;s currently 1am exactly so i&amp;#8217;m having to type incredibly quietly as to not disturb anyone, despite the fact i&amp;#8217;m in my own room with the door shut etc, i have a terrible feeling like my drumming on the keyboard is keeping everyone awake. OH WELL. Either way, it&amp;#8217;s currently christmas day. And i haven&amp;#8217;t finished wrapping the presents yet. Oh shi&amp;#8217;. Which reminds me, never go shopping on christmas eve, i felt like a jew at Auschwitz. Ok, that joke may have been a bit racist or something but i don&amp;#8217;t mind, it&amp;#8217;s christmas i can get away with anything. Which reminds me.. it&amp;#8217;s my birthday in 5 days. I expect lots of lovely messages/texts/presents. Yes plz. I had something else deep and meaningfull to say but i can&amp;#8217;t remember what it was. OH WELL Notthat important clearly. I suppose a &amp;#8220;Happy Christmas&amp;#8221; would finish this off nicely but everyone seems to have forgotten to say happy birthday to Barry Aldridge. Who&amp;#8217;s currently celebrating his 47th birthday i do believe. KTHNXBAI. p.s i remembered what that important thing was for.. was going to tell you about my weekend but cba tell you another time.
