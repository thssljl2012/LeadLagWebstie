Sometimes, even bleak economic times like this, the Grinch doesnt have a chance. Just ask Leannette M. Spence, assistant vice president and personal banker at the Bank of America in Cambrian Park. Last week, Spence had a customer who accidentally left her card in the banks ATM. When the customer called in to cancel it, she learned that a $200 cash withdrawal had been made at the same ATM immediately after she left, which led to all kinds of anxiety on her part: was there a way to track down who stole it? Could she get the money back in time for Christmas? Just as things were looking dire, the customer discovered that another transaction had been made later that day: this time, a deposit for $200. Thoroughly confused, she was put in touch with Spence, who knew the story first-hand: after withdrawing the $200 on the lost ATM card, the withdrawee walked into the branch and returned both the card and cash. It was the first time Spence has ever had someone return cash that didnt belong to them, and the timing couldnt be better. It was pretty amazing, Spence said with that certain holiday glow. With times as tough as they are, its nice to see the goodwill in people.
