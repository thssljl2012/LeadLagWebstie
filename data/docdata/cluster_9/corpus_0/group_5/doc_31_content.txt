Christmas is a major celebration day in a year for most of us. Nearly all restaurants also "full house" in the eve night. If you are not making any reservation, sure suffer for finding your Christmas dinner that night.I went for mine at Puchong (same street as Citibank). The above photois my Chritmas Turkey Dinner Set. This was costing me RM40, feel like little but expensive caused it seems like very less only and not enough for me. But since is Chritmas eve, I think such price still considered as reasonable. How about you all? Where you all eat your Christmas Dinner?Finally, wishing all of you "Merry Christmas"!
