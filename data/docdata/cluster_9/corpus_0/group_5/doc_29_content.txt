I had 1 of 'e *Top10 Most-Lost-Moments* on 'e 17th. I had to last minute shopping for 'e Xmas dinner at my work place on 19th. Rush rush rush...~ Here is a list of what happened. =X1. It was my 1st time to order Turkey. Popped by Cold Storage, Ntuc, DeliFrance etc. All needed 4days in advanced to book. So there goes my Turkey. 2. I realised that I could only purchase a Log-Cake which shouldn't post a significant issue for me. BUT, 'e new layout of Jurong Point nearly made it impossible to locate 'e Bakeries. 3. The bakery that I managed to find was located in the new wing. Unfortuantely, it only accepted Cash &amp;amp; CitiBank credit card. Brilliant -.- I left exactly S$40 for 'e Log-Cake. Only coins left for myself to buy dinner. +Sigh+ 4. After queueing up @ 'e new DBS Bank, 'e ATM only allows MINIMAL S$200 withdrawal. +Faint+ 5. I walked over to 'e old wing 'e find 'e atm machine located in 'e old Ntuc BUT 'e queue was too loonnngggg... My stomach was growling fiercely, brain swirling +++6. Ultimately, I gave up with all limbs up. Used my minimal coins to buy Honey Green Tea 'w Mini Pearls &amp;amp; slowly sulked my way home, Pedestrian-style. I went to watch Twilight with Jing. It was alright, not as nice as I thought it would be. Oh well... But Edward Cullen &amp;amp; Bella Swan were darn nice looking.Iron &amp;amp; Wine - Flightless bird, American mouth
