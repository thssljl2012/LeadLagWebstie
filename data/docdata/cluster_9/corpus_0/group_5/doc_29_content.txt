     The last few days at the office were incredibly nerve wrecking. &amp;#0160;As I reflect on the last 48 hours I can pinpoint the source of my aggravation to Adweek's crappy reporting. It rocked the foundation of my Nationwide team this past week.It began when my iPhone's RSS feed sent chills of terror from my pocket down my back on the morning of the 22nd. The headline that caught my eye was &amp;quot;Nationwide Insurance Goes Into Play&amp;quot;. Immediately I put my coffee on my desk and read further. &amp;#0160;There it was every agencies worst nightmare. A line that implies your hard work was under creative review.&amp;quot;Nationwide also uses WPP Group's Wunderman here for direct marketing duties, but it was not immediately clear if direct marketing duties are part of the creative review. Wunderman, UM and ABA could not immediately be reached.&amp;quot;It wasn't 4 seconds after I read that sentence that my email box started blinking with messages from friends, colleagues and the Wunderman executives. &amp;#0160;While choking on my coffee, I reached for the phone to call my account teammate. &amp;#0160; After checking in with our clients and then triple checking our voice mails we confirmed that no one from Adweek, particularly Andrew McMains, had reached out to the Wunderman / Nationwide team prior to the story being published.&amp;#0160;In a time when there is not an American company or brand who is not cutting back, reviewing their media budgets or considering how they might fair the economic downturn, one would think that Adweek would be fact checking and not publishing stories without being able to quote the name-able source for the information.As the link to the story circulated through the in boxes of my Nationwide team, who are currently in the midst of creating the 2009 Nationwide Insurance NASCAR campaign, I was relegated to stop creating and calm the freaked-out faces that were streaming in to my office and calling from the midsts of the holiday vacations.With the speed of NIKE (or Nic) the winged goddess our Wunder-PR group lept in to action. And on the 23rd Adweek published this &amp;quot;Update&amp;quot; Nationwide Preps Parallel Pitches - Insurer to evaluate creative, media in separate competitions. In that article Adweek corrected its previous claim.&amp;quot;Direct marketing duties, at WPP Group's Wunderman in New York, are not in play.&amp;quot;Although our client had confirmed it the day before - the tension only began to loosen after I read that sentence. &amp;#0160;Then my eye moved to the left hand side of the article...and my eyes grew wide. &amp;quot;What the filth, filth, flarn, flarn, filth, they did it again!&amp;quot; I yelped.&amp;#0160; To add insult to injury when the article was updated Adweek made yet another mind-blowing mistake! (see below) They showed an example of our &amp;quot;Game Show&amp;quot; campaign and attributed it to T:M. &amp;#0160;My team went bezerk!                                                                                                                                 The Nationwide Insurance &amp;quot;Game Show&amp;quot; campaign is a Wunderman creation that we are incredibly proud of. &amp;#0160;It is a high performing campaign that has combined a simple creative concept with direct marketing principles to make phone ringing magic for our clients.The creative team who created this campaign are as follows:                                                                                                                                Nick Moore - Chief Creative Officer Joanna Pea-Bickley - Executive Creative Director Jennifer Leuzzi - Copy Writer David Cole - Art Director Chris Loccisano - &amp;#0160;Art Director (Interactive)  Susan Lekanides- Producer &amp;quot;Lil&amp;quot; X - Director RedCar - Editors                                                                                                                                 Here are a few links to the &amp;quot;Game Show&amp;quot; advertising:                                                                                                                                Nationwide Insurance Commercial  Taking the game show route. Does it rock or suck?

Seems that the reporter,&amp;#0160;Andrew McMains, who reported this story must have missed his first year of Journalism class!&amp;#0160;
