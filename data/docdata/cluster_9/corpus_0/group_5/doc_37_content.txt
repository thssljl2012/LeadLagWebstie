Deposit Ogre's paycheck:  10 person line at BECU cash machineGet Gas:  Cars waiting in lines at the Safeway gas stationGet baby food, maxi pads, and canned cat food:  No parking at SafewayTurned around, went to US Bank machine where we can deposit but not withdraw without a fee, gassed up at Circle K, came home, ate Red Velvet cake and am waiting for the Boy. We are going to go get yarn and spend his gift certificates for Games and Gizmos, grab some coffee and lunch, and then hit whole foods for organic baby food and canned cat food, and maxi pads.  7th Generation finally has a super maxi that is.  Yay!The_Grrsl is snoring away next to me.  She snores louder than any cat I have ever had, and always has.
