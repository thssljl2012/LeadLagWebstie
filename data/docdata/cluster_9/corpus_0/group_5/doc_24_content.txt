Happy Holidays Warrior Monkeys... Merry Christmas (if you celebrate) and Happy New Year! 2008 sure went by fast, but that's good because it means we were having fun, right?Running around Shanghai recently, I found a few cafes that I want to recommend to y'all:The 1st is UP's cafe in Wujiaochang. Its is on the 1st floor of BaiLian YouYiCheung and is hidden behind the elevator with good food (albeit a little slow). They're having a holiday party tonight, and I might be there later...The 2nd is a cafe called Friends (&amp;quot;F-R-I-E-N-D-S&amp;quot;) downtown. Friends just opened two weeks ago by a few cool Canadian guys, CBA's (Canadian-Born-Asians... some CBC's, and others too). The cafe is super small and has a great modern atmosphere. If you're downtown, check it out, its on XinLe Lu (behind HuaiHai Lu).There seems to be lots of parties around Shanghai this time of year and I hope to see you at one of them! Keep it merry!!Bt
