The reason I doubt it is because of our need for parking garages. I guess it's possible but it seems the trend is fat rectangular buildings, at least in Houston.two: When do yall think we will get another gem like the Bank of America tower? The closest thing I've lately is MainPlace, but that's more for it's function. Not that the design isn't nice, but it's not striking. It's sleek. I like that about it.
