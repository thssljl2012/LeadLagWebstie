The robbers wanted to make sure that they were especially deadly by carrying the most dangerous weapons around:Three to four men heavily armed with automatic and assault weapons and dressed in dark clothing and masks robbed an armored truck outside a Bank of America at 10:35 a.m., police said.Not only did they have super deadly assault thingys, they had machine guns too!But I must be missing something.  How is it that these "weapons of war" that are meant to be "spray fired from the hip" and are "only meant to kill people" didn't enable these men to, you know, actually kill anyone.  Maybe theirs were broken?
