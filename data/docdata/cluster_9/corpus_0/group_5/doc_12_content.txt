In addition to irritating the hell out of me as explained in the post below, the god damn Seal playing, lisp slurring, wife beater promoting, bald headed, beer not recommending bartender from Axis gave me the wrong credit card Saturday night. Jordan A Nelms: I have your Redskins Bank of America card and you have mine. Go Skins.Oh good. I didn't really need access to my money right before Christmas anyway. And it wasn't too embarrassing when "STOLEN" came up on the register when I tried to pick up a prescription at CVS with said card. Because only a winner  buys birth control with a stolen credit card. I'm glad people got to see that.A big congratulations to Axis Bar &amp; Grill in Washington, DC. You are 2b1b's first BOYCOTTED bar.
