Comments   Recommend  IRVINE  Authorities are looking for a man who reportedly got away from a bank with more than $3,700 after an armed robbery Monday night.  The man walked into the Bank of America in the 14200 block of Culver around 5:30 p.m., Irvine police Lt. Rick Handfield said. He walked up to a teller, gave them a note demanding money, and showed the handle of a gun, Handfield said.  After receiving the money, the robber fled on foot, Handfield said. He declined to specify how much the man escaped with, but earlier police reports indicated that he stole $3,752.  Police described the suspect as an Asian male between the ages of 35 and 45, about 5 feet 6 inches tall and about 160 pounds. He was wearing a white baseball cap, tan sweatshirt and baggy pants, Handfield said.  Police are asking anyone with information on the robbery to call Handfield at 949-724-7112.
