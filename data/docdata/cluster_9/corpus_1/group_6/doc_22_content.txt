JACKSONVILLE, FL -- The family of Ron McClelland will host two memorial services for the First Coast radio personality and member of Storyside: B.  The memorial services will be held at his two home churches in Jacksonville, FL, and Redford, MI.  Attendees are asked to dress casual, as if they were attending a Storyside: B concert.  The second will be held on Saturday, January 24, at 10 a.m. at Detroit World Outreach Ministry.  Both services are open to the public. In lieu of flowers, friends are asked to donate to a fund to support McClelland's family. The Ron and Rebecca McClelland Fund has been set up at Bank of America. It ends in 8678.  McClelland, 33, died Sunday while playing basketball on the Jacksonville-based Carnival ship Fascination.  CLICK HEREto read more about McClelland.  No official cause has been released.
