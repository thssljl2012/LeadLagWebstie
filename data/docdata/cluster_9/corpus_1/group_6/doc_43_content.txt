At the final day of the Commonwealth Bank 2009 Australian Etchells Championships, hosted by the Royal SA Yacht Squadron, the wind and waves provided tough and challenging conditions. Final race, after a general recall the second start was clean away. The fleet split with a poor start for Ian Johnson " Bananas in Pyjamas. At the top mark, the leaders came in from port tack, with John Bertrand (Triad) crossing ahead. Rounding the mark; Bertrand, Mark Bulka (Critical Balance), Rob Brown (Steampacket 7) and then the New Zealander Alistair Gair (Velsheda), rounded with very little between them. With Bertrand expected to retire having already won the championship yesterday and with second nearly in the bag for Gair; needing to finish seventh or lower with Bulka finishing first, there was still much interest from the spectator boats braving the tough conditions. With the Magic Kiwis Gair and crew chasing and known for their surfing skills the battle for second with Bulka was on. Bertrand pulled out at the bottom aiming to win the race for the dockside crane and headed in. The wind increased to over 20 knots with the waves starting to show some structure with the tide going slack. The fleet split again for the second beat, tacked up the middle chasing the shifts. At the top mark approaching on Port tack " Brown, Bulka, Gair and Skip Lissiman (Bandwagon), all turned with very little to separate them. Another sparkling furious surfing session ensued, to the bottom mark with now only 34 boats competing. The wind increased further for the final beat, the fleet headed into Largs Bay, at the gun it was Bulka with over six boat lengths from Gair and then Brown. The last great race of the championship then commenced; the battle to the dockside crane. A protest involving Bulka is being heard though will not affect the second place of Gair, however is likely to impact on third and fourth place. Comments from the racers. Shane Dussen (Wood Duck).
