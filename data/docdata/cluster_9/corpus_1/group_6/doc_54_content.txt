An Ohio man may have tipped off his intentions when he stood in line at a bank wearing a ski mask before staging a holdup.  Police in Stow say Feliks Goldshtein of Highland Heights was arrested on Thursday following a brief car chase.  Police say the teller asked the man to take off the mask before being served. The man displayed what turned out to be a toy gun and demanded money from the teller. He made off with an undisclosed amount.  Police Captain Rick Myers says it's unusual for a masked robber to wait in line at a bank.  The 24-year-old man remained jailed on Friday on charges of aggravated robbery and failure to comply with a police order.
