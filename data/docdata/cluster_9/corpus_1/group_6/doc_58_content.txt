U.S. Bank will drop its sponsorship of Milwaukee's PGA tournament after this year instead of picking up a three-year option starting in 2010.  MILWAUKEE -- U.S. Bank will drop its sponsorship of Milwaukee's PGA tournament after this year instead of picking up a three-year option starting in 2010.  Bill Bertha, president of U.S. Bank's Wisconsin market, said officials of the Minneapolis-based bank were disappointed with poor ratings on the Golf Channel and sparse attendance at Brown Deer golf course after the tournament dates were changed in 2007. That change put the event opposite the British Open.  U.S. Bank became title sponsor in 2004 of what had been the Greater Milwaukee Open. This year's tournament is July 13-19 at Brown Deer.
