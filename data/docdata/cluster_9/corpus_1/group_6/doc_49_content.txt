The worlds first snowbike races are scheduled to take place during the 44th annual McCall Winter Carnival, on February 7, 2009. Known as The Project Filter, 2Moto Ground Zero, the event will take place on the McCall Golf Course, just off of Main Street in McCall, Idaho and is expected to draw over 1,000 spectators and dozens of participants from across the United States. Snowbiking is a relatively recent form of winter recreation, pioneered by 2Moto, an Idaho-based company, where a ski and a lightweight, high-performance track are fitted to modern, off-road motorcycles. 2Moto snowbikes are easy to maneuver, and weigh as much as 300 pounds less than a snowmobile. They are also much less expensive, and allow a dirt bike rider to quickly and easily convert his motorcycle for use in the winter. 2Moto snowbikes can be ridden around slowly, or jumped and cornered much like a dirt  bike.  Ground Zero will allow snowbike owners and enthusiasts to compete on a  mile, groomed track on the McCall Golf Course that will feature both right and left hand turns and four jumps. The trophy event will allow snowbike owners, from all over the U.S. and Canada, to compete against each other for trophies, prizes and bragging rights. The Legends event will put famous motorsports legends on the track together including Malcolm Smith, Mike Metzger, Dangerous Darrell Schultz, Alexander Smith, Steve Hatch, John Dowd, and Bret and Robie Peterson. Ground Zero is presented by Project Filter, and is sponsored by 2Moto, Lets Ride Suzuki, Maverik Country Stores, Boondocker Nitrous, Charmac Trailers, Rekluse, Frost Mortgage, Nationwide Insurance, Pro-Moto Billet, Moto Tech, Scott USA, Fly Racing, Sprint Cellular, Obsession Motor Worx, HMK Clothing, Beaverton Honda and Hinson Powersports.
