CHARLOTTE -- The Carolina Panthers playoff run begins Saturday night when they meet the NFC West champion Arizona Cardinals at Bank of America Stadium.  The Panthers went a perfect 8-0 at home en route to an NFC South title. The streak included a 27-23 win over Arizona on Oct. 26. In that game, the teams combined for 776 yards of offense. DeAngelo Williams, who led Carolina with 108 rushing yards and a touchdown on 17 carries, says the Panthers need to be at the top of their game to beat the Cards again.  'They're a high flying team on offense, they're solid on defense, he said. They stopped the run against Atlanta last week, so we know that if we don't come with our A-game we'll leave with our heads down.  So hopefully we come with our A-game and play them tough and play them hard and come out with a victory.'  Kickoff is set for 8:15 p.m. The winner of the game will either visit the Giants or host the Eagles in the NFC Championship Game.
