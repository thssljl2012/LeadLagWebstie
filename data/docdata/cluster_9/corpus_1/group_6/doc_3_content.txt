North Little Rock police are looking for the person they say attempted to rob a bank Monday afternoon.  Officers say a man walked into the Scott Banking Center on Highway 165, went up to a teller -- and, then turned around and walked out.  Witnesses say the man showed a weapon, but didn't have a note and didn't ask for the cash.  Police say tellers sit behind bullet proof glass and that may have detered him from actually robbing the bank.  He left in a silver car -- but, police don't know where he was headed.  Meanwhile, in Little Rock, about an hour or so later, someone walked into the Bank of America branch on West Markham and robbed it.  Police say he got away with some cash.  No one was injured -- and police have not made any arrests.  Right now, there's no word on whether the attempted robbery in North Little Rock is connected to this one.
