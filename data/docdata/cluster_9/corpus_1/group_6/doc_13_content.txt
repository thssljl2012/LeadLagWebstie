CHARLOTTE -- The skies above Charlotte will stay blue late into the evening Saturday.  The Bank of America building and others that make up the Queen City skyline will glow blue to show support for the Panthers in their divisional playoff game against Arizona.  Those buildings were also lit up in blue when the Panthers took on Tampa Bay in a Monday Night Football clash earlier this year.  The game kicks off at 8:15. Following the game, switch over to News 14 Carolina for a special edition of Sports Night with live locker room coverage and the news conferences of coach John Fox and quarterback Jake Delhomme.
