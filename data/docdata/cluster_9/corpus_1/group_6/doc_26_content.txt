Accused Thief Obeys Security Guard's Order  PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- An alleged bank robber didn't mind giving police a clear view of his face -- he obeyed a security guard and removed the scarf around his head before heading to a teller.  The man, whose name has not been released, was arrested Wednesday after trying to rob one bank, then successfully completing the task at another bank an hour later.  Police say when the man entered a Bank of America on Wednesday, a security guard asked him to remove the scarf covering his face. He obliged, showing his face for the security camera.  He then handed a note demanding money to a bank teller. When the teller refused, he left.  An hour later, the same man allegedly robbed a nearby Citizens Bank.
