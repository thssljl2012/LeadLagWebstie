COLUMBUS, Ohio -- NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. and his JR Motorsports company are powering a new ad campaign for Nationwide Insurance.  The Columbus-based company said the commercials that begin airing next month will be different from the humorous 'Life Comes at You Fast' campaign of recent years. It featured celebrities such as Britney Spear's ex-husband Kevin Federline poking fun at themselves.  Nationwide associate vice president of sponsorships John Aman said the company didn't want to keep making jokes at a time when people are worried about the economy, their jobs and their retirement plans.  So, Earnhardt will appear as a satisfied Nationwide customer. In a statement Tuesday, he said his family has been insured through Nationwide for three generations.
