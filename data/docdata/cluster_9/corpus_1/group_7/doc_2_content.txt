Finding a run-over, dead cat in a plastic bag on Maxwell's Line fouled a pleasant weekend walk for Palmerston North resident Allen Oliver.  A furry tabby leg was protruding from the plastic supermarket shopping bag, which was in the middle of the road between College Street and Long Melford Road on Saturday.  He found a full-grown, well-kept pet dead in the bag.  The bag had been run over by a vehicle, and the bag was all scratched up.  Mr Oliver believes the cat was alive when it was put into the bag. 'You could see it, the way the bag was scratched up. That's a pretty low-life thing to do, it made me pretty sick.' He moved the bag to the side of the road so other vehicles wouldn't hit it. It had been removed the next day.  Palmerston North SPCA spokeswoman Jody Gordon hadn't heard of this episode, but said animals in bags wasn't new. People also still tried to drown unwanted animals. 'We've got cages outside (the SPCA) where people can leave genuinely unwanted animals, to prevent incidents like this,' she said. Not having seen the cat in Saturday's incident, she couldn't speculate about it.  * ANZ Bank staff and customers in Palmerston North have collected more than 100 cans of pet food for the SPCA. The society always needs gifts of animal food and money donations to help prevent cruelty to animals.
