A regular customer at a San Francisco bank was arrested after he allegedly robbed the branch and left his ATM card behind, police said today.  Daude Muimpe, 33, walked into the Bank of America at 500 Battery St. about 3:45 p.m. Monday and asked a teller for help with his ATM card, authorities said.  As the teller was placing bills in her money drawer, the robber reached over the counter, grabbed some cash and ran, police said.  The problem was, Muimpe had been in the bank before, and the teller recognized him, authorities said.  Investigators also had no problems identifying him because he left the ATM card behind, police said. Officers arrested him shortly after the holdup.  E-mail Henry K. Lee at hlee@sfchronicle.com.
