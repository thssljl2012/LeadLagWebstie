The record belongs to Al Knapp.   Outscoring host Camden in every period, Vernon-Verona-Sherrill sped to a 68-32 win in a Tri-Valley League boys basketball game Friday night. The Red Devils presented Knapp with the 521st victory of his 32-year coaching career, setting an all-time Section III record. Knapp is now 521-182 overall in his years at both Brookfield and V-V-S.   Knapp, who celebrates his 59th birthday Sunday, moved past the late Dave Powers of Oswego to seize the all-time No. 1 spot.   Evan Croll had 18 points and 6-foot-10 center Adam Kemp added 14 as V-V-S (9-4, 14-4) blitzed the last-place Blue Devils. 'This win was for my family, for all the fans who supported me at Brookfield and V-V-S, and also for the more than 200 players that I've coached at those two schools,' Knapp said. 'I have to say I'm relieved to get this win, because there has been too much of a fuss made over me in recent days.' As the game concluded, Knapp was presented with the game ball by members of the Camden athletic staff as a show of respect for all he has accomplished.
