 MILLARD K. IVES  Staff Writer  CLERMONT -- A manhunt -- or is it a woman-hunt -- is on for a bank robber apparently covered up so well that investigators couldn't identify the gender.  The robber fled out of a Bank of America branch in Clermont Wednesday afternoon with an undetermined amount of money.  Even with the aid of helicopters and bloodhounds as well as detectives sifting through the crime scene, deputies were unable to locate the unidentified robber -- who wore a white bandana wrapped around the head, under a dark-colored baseball cap with the hair tucked underneath.  Deputies responded to a silent alarm at the 518 U.S. Highway 27 bank just before 12:30 p.m.  Sgt. John Herrell, sheriff's spokesman, said the suspect entered the bank and presented a note to the teller, implying that there was a weapon.  The suspect grabbed the money and was last seen in the nearby Wal-Mart parking lot.  No weapon was shown and no injuries were sustained during the hold up.  Herrell described the robber as black and about 5 foot 6, with a slender build and wearing black pants and a plaid shirt.  A black and white photo from a surveillance camera released from the sheriff's office shows that the robber's face is revealed under the cap and bandana, but Herrell said the bank teller could not make a positive identification of the gender.  Detectives are asking anyone with information on the robbery to call the Lake County Sheriff's Office at (352) 343-9500 or CRIMELINE at 1-800-423-TIPS, where they could be eligible for a reward.
