  UPDATED: 12:44 pm MST February 20, 2009  PHOENIX -- Police are tracking the trail of a man covered in dye after he robbed a Bank of America on Friday morning, authorities said.  The bank, which is located near 51st Street and Elliot Road in Ahwatukee, was robbed around 9 a.m., deputies said.  The man escaped with an undisclosed amount of cash; however, he was given a dye pack that exploded after he ran across 51st Street to a McDonalds, investigators said.  The robber dumped the dyed bills, but a K-9 unit picked up the scent and led deputies to a nearby hotel, authorities said. Although deputies looked around the hotel, they do not have a suspect.  According to deputies, the robber is described as a Hispanic male wearing a red or gray sweatshirt that is possibly covered with dye.  One witness reported seeing a man with smoke coming from his pocket run across the street at the time of the robbery. He was wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt and khaki shorts, she said.
