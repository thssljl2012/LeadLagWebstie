The Sun newspaper has reproduced an AIG motor insurance claim leaked to the internet that draws the alleged whiplash victim as a freeloading fat chav.  AIG has promised action against the worker who leaked it.  Insured driver James Edwards wrote the report in response to a whiplash compensation claim by a Miss Pywell  and drew a picture of her in the space left for dawing the positions of the two cars.  His form says: I very slightly touched the rear bumper of the car in front. There was no damage and Miss Pywell is a fat chav who definitely does not have whiplash.
