 Staff Writer ORMOND BEACH - One man robbed two banks within 40 minutes of each other this morning, Ormond Beach police said, and he is still at large.   The FBI has joined police to investigate the today's heists at banks about 3 miles apart. Police believe this is the third robbery by this suspect, said Sgt. Kenny Hayes, Ormond Beach police spokesman.   Surveillance photo from SunTrust Hayes called this morning's robberies 'brazen' and said investigators are '100 percent sure' it's the same suspect who pulled a heist at another SunTrust Bank north of the city. 'It's pretty brazen to commit the crime at all, much less two in such a short time frame,' Hayes said this afternoon. 'This happened along Nova Road, a pretty busy area, so it's easy to blend in.' Hayes said several investigators are canvassing the area now. Surveillance photo from Bank of America The first robbery was reported at 10:20 a.m. at the Bank of America in Ormond Towne Square on West Granada Boulevard. In that case, the lone suspect entered the bank and approached a teller. The suspect had his hands in his jacket implying a weapon and demanded money. The teller complied and the suspect quickly walked out of the bank. Shortly after 11 a.m. the same suspect used the same tactics at the SunTrust Bank on North Nova Road.   A witness reported seeing the suspect leave the parking lot in a white pickup and head north on North Nova.   The suspect is described as a white male in his late 40s to early 50s, with graying blonde hair and a scruffy beard and mustache. His description is similar to a man who robbed a SunTrust bank north of Ormond Beach on Feb. 6, then a Wachovia Bank in Deltona on Feb. 9.   He was last seen wearing a dark blue jacket and blue jeans. Anyone with information on this crime is asked to contact Ormond Beach police, 386-677-0731 or Crime Stoppers, 888-277-TIPS.
