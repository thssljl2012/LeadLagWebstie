Reno police are looking for a bank robber.  The suspect entered the US Bank on Vassar Street about 10:35 a.m. Thursday and handed the clerk a note that said he was armed and demanded money. He fled the bank on foot with an undisclosed amount of cash.  Police say he remains at large despite an exhaustive search of the surrounding area about a mile southeast of the downtown casino district.
