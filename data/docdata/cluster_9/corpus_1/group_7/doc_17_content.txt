Orlando police said the person who robbed a bank on Narcoossee Road today appears to have been the same person who robbed a bank in Four Corners on Thursday. The robber who hit the Bank of America at 10419 Narcoosee Road today 'fled with an undetermined amount of money,'' according to a news release from OPD Sgt. Barb Jones. She said officials are still trying to confirm if suspect is male or female. The 'suspect appears to be the same suspect involved in a robbery to the Bank of America in Clermont,'' she wrote. According to Jones, the robber is in his or her early 20s and 'entered the bank and passed a note to the teller.' Jones added in a news release: 'No weapon was seen, just implied. .. The suspect vehicle is unconfirmed at this time.' The robbery occurred at 10:58 a.m. At 12:18 p.m. Thursday, a bank robber wearing a dark ball cap and white bandanna robbed the Bank of America at 518 U.S. Highway 27 in south Lake County. The robber did not display a weapon during the Four Corners heist but handed a note to a teller that implied the robber was armed. Sheriff's spokesman Sgt. John Herrell said the individual received an undisclosed amount of cash from the teller and fled into the parking lot of the nearby Wal-Mart. Deputies on Thursday used a helicopter and a bloodhound in their search for the robber, who was described as a slender 5-foot-6 person wearing a dark-colored cap, white bandanna, plaid shirt and black pants.
