Bank surveillance photo from Thursday robber.  Related Links MILLARD K. IVES  Staff Writer  CLERMONT -- Lake County Sheriff's detectives are looking into whether a person who robbed an Orlando bank Thursday was the same person who held up a Clermont bank Wednesday.  The robber hit the Bank of America at 10419 Narcoosee Road near the airport just before 11 a.m. Thursday, passing a note implying they were armed, before fleeing with an undetermined amount of money.  It was the same method used to rob a Bank of America on U.S. Highway 27 in Clermont early Wednesday afternoon.  According to surveillance camera photos from both banks, the robber appears to have the same, youthful facial features and similar clothing -- with the hair tucked underneath a baseball cap and bandana, making it difficult to identify the suspect or the gender, investigators said.  In Thursday's robbery, the person was wearing a white cap, compared to a dark-colored cap in the Clermont hold-up. The shirts worn are different.  However, Sgt. Barb Jones, Orlando Police Department spokeswoman, said that after looking at the photos, the robber appears to be the same person.  Lake County Sheriff's officials described the robber as black and about 5 foot 6, with a slender build and wearing black pants and a plaid shirt. Orlando police said the robber appeared to be in the early 20s.  Both agencies are expected to work on the two robberies together.
