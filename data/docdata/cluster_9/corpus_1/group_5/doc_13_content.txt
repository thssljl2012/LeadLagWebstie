'We finished up in Hawaii the day after Thanksgiving last week. That was our 50th state.' It was the last stop on Jim and Linda Parker's four year journey of donating blood. 'It's been a tremendous personal experience for us.' The experience started when Jim decided his regular blood donations weren't enough. 'Nationwide, there's a critical shortage of blood products. The need for new donors is very critical.' So he asked his wife to drive across the country. He wanted to give blood in every state and educate people along the way. 'I didn't see how we could do it, but I said go ahead and he had to plan it. Well he did,' Linda said. And Donating Across America started. 'There's no better way to help your fellow man or humanity than to donate blood. It doesn't cost anything, you don't have to take something out of your bank account to give it to charity.' While they gave, the Parkers also collected signatures, documenting each trip to the blood bank. 'To think all of these people smiled when they filled it out because they knew this would be on our wall.' But her biggest badge of honor is the bruise on her arm. 'It's a donation and if you rethink it, I'm not going to go in there to get my arm stuck with a needle. I'm going in there to save lives.' And they hope others are encouraged to do the same.  The Parkers are the first people to donate blood in every state.  They drove more than 113,000 miles and spent $30,000 along the way.  They continue to donate regularly in Wichita and Salina.
