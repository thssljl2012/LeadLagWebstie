Slave to the Businessman to kick a -yard field goal to put St. Louis ahead, 0-, with :0 left in the game. Categories:   COMMENTS: Comment by BobbyK @ :0 - Sunday, December th, 00 Maybe he'll be in a good mood after the game so he won't have to pretend he's back at the University of Nebraska and beating his girlfriend. Of course, maybe he has a wife to beat now. Or a husband for all I know about Josh Brown. Douche. You can go through the archives and I've never been a Josh Brown even when he was kicking game winners for us. Once a pile of crap, always a pile of crap --- welcome to the life of Josh Brown. Comment by BobbyK @ :0 - Sunday, December th, 00 With the way Mare is kicking this year, why in the world would we consider a different kicker for '0? Comment by Dukeshire @ : - Sunday, December th, 00 Please tell me it didn't take until the th game for you to ask that. I will ask this who has a more redundant spot on the roster, Coutu or Duckett? Why are either here? (Mare and Weaver / Schmitt) Comment by dsquid @ : - Sunday, December th, 00 @Dukeshire - why do you care? It's not like there's some great player we don't have on the roster because we're carrying the future at K or a short yardage specialist.  Find something else to complain about, like the color of Ruskell's socks. This just in - they're *faded*. /gasp Comment by BobbyK @ :0 - Sunday, December th, 00 Dukeshire - you know me better than that... we write so dang much that we repeat ourselves and I'm repeating myself on this Mare/Coutu answer.  dsquid must think it was a smart move for Ruskell to release Forsett and keep Coutu on the active roster. Of course, Ruskell is so smart that he knew Forsett would get released by Indy so he could claim him again. Comment by Dukeshire @ : - Sunday, December th, 00 True, good point. Comment by Dukeshire @ : - Sunday, December th, 00 dsquid - It just seems like the better teams don't have multiple players that fill the same role. Nothing more. I'm sorry that offended you. Comment by dsquid @ : - Sunday, December th, 00 @BobbyK - I am ambivalent about the Forsett jockeying. I don't see the move as connected.  If Coutu ends up being a very good player for us, then everything is justified.  We won't know the answer to that for some time.  Comment by BobbyK @ :0 - Sunday, December th, 00 I didn't think there were any members of the Ruskell Cult left on the blog.
