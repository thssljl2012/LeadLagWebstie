:21:56 (Beijing Time) Xinhua English  RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- Citibank executive Gustavo Gomes Matarazzo, who was 33, was murdered late Sunday in Sao Paulo during a carjack.  According to the police, Matarazzo was arriving home and parking his car, a Mitsubishi Pajero, in the garage, when he was approached by two men. An eyewitness, Matarazzo's 34-year-old neighbor, saw the executive start arguing with the criminal suspects.  Matarazzo was shot twice, one in his head and the other in his stomach. He was taken to the nearby Tatuape Emergency Room, where he succumbed to the fatal injuries.  The executive's mother was frightened by the gunshots and ran to the window. According to the police, she saw two dark-skinned men fleeing the scene on foot. The police believe they fled to the nearby Sape slum.  No one was arrested. Citibank released on Monday a statement expressing its regrets about Matarazzo's murder.  The Tatuape neighborhood, where the crime took place, is a residential area said to be dangerous. Neighbors of the victims said that carjacks and house robberies are frequent, and that sometimes criminals take hostages.  It was the second carjack followed by murder in Sao Paulo in the last three days. On Saturday, 54-year-old doctor Nadir Oyakawa was shot dead in front of her sister's house, when three men tried to steal her car.
