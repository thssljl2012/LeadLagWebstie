The King County Sheriff's Office has released surveillance photographs of a man who they say grabbed a bag of money from a customer outside a SeaTac bank last month.  The customer, an employee at a nearby deli, was on his way to make a deposit at the Bank of America branch in the 16600 block of International Boulevard on Nov. 21 when the man grabbed the bank bag and fled, according to the Sheriff's Office.  The suspect, described as a 5-foot-6, had been lurking around the automated teller machines near the bank's entrance when the 61-year-old deli employee walked by, deputies said. The customer chased the suspect, but the thief got away.
