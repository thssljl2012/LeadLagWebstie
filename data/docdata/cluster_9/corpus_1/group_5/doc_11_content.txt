HAPPY VALLEY, Ore. -- A Happy Valley man used an NFL-style tackle to help sheriff's deputies arrest a violent robbery suspect Tuesday, according to the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office.  The robbery occurred around 4 p.m. at the Bank of America on Southeast Sunnyside Road.  Roger Onstott, who was on his way out of a nearby veterinary clinic, said he noticed a man push a woman into a brick pillar in front of the bank.  The woman was carrying a bank bag full of money and the robber grabbed the bag, authorities said. Onstott chased the suspect, tackled him to the ground and held him there until a deputy arrived at the scene a few moments later, according to the sheriff's office.  It was just a natural instinct,' Onstott said. 'When he knocked her down, it was natural to help her and run after and get him.'Paramedics took the woman to the hospital with injuries to the nose and chest. They also took the suspect, Chas Lombardo, to the hospital to be treated for minor injuries.  He's now in custody on robbery charges.
