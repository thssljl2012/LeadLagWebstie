 A CROSS-dressing bandit is on the run after a daylight bank robbery yesterday.  Wearing a black dress, stockings and a blonde wig the robber - dubbed 'Connie' after bandit couple Bonnie and Clyde - tied up three Commonwealth Bank employees at the North Strathfield branch before running away.  Bizarrely, his disguise was made less than perfect by the addition of ... a goatee beard.  Police say the robber threatened staff with a pistol before making off with a sum of cash about 8.30am.  Police confirmed the thief was a man after workers spotted what they thought was a suspiciously masculine-looking woman sitting on the corner of Concord Rd and Clermont Ave prior to the robbery. 'There was one offender dressed as a woman. He was clearly a man,' Detective Inspector Hans Rupp said. 'Police from the forensic armed robbery unit are conducting an examination of the crime scene including fingerprints and DNA swabs,' Insp Rupp said. Ambulance officers treated the three bank employees, who were opening the bank at the time of the robbery, and one - a woman in her 50s - was transferred from the police station to hospital suffering chest pains.  David Bermejo, 20, an employee at a neighbouring computer store, said he spotted the suspicious-looking man about 8am as he made his way to work. 'I thought he looked a bit strange - I thought my eyes might be playing tricks on me,' he said. Mark Boughton, from Solver Paints, also saw the man seated outside his shop prior to the robbery. 'I thought: 'Gee, that's an ugly woman',' he said.
