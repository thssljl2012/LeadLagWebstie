 An unshaven man wearing a dress and a long blonde wig threatened three Sydney bank employees with a gun before tying them up and making off with a sum of cash.  Police say the cross-dressing gunman entered the Commonwealth Bank in Concord Rd at North Strathfield about 6.30am (WST) on Tuesday, as three staff members were opening for the day.  The man, clad in a black dress and matching stockings, assaulted the employees and tied them up before fleeing on foot with the money.  Detective Inspector Hans Rupp of the Robbery and Serious Crimes Squad said investigators had scoured the crime scene for fingerprints and other evidence.  There was one lone offender, dressed as a woman, who was clearly a man, Det-Insp. Rupp told reporters.  A number of staff were assaulted during the commission of the offence and tied up.  After the offender escaped, we dont know which way he went.  An employee of a neighbouring business told AAP he came to work and noticed a man sitting on a bench across the street.  It appeared to be a guy dressed as a lady, said the man, who asked not to be identified.  He was dressed in black, with a black dress, black stockings, a blonde wig about shoulder length and he had facial hair.  He was just sitting there.  I didnt take notice of it, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me.  He said his colleague came in minutes later and told him he too had noticed the man.  About 10-15 minutes later, I heard cop cars parked out the front, the man said.  A Commonwealth Bank spokeswoman told AAP no one was injured during the incident and staff involved were offered counselling at the crime scene.
