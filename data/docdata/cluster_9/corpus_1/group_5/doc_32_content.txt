Rawi Hage's 'Cockroach' a portrait of an unwanted man  Posted 1 hour ago  Cockroach By Rawi Hage House of Anansi Press  In June 2008, Rawi Hage was named winner of the world's richest literary prize, the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, for 'De Niro's Game,' the first debut novel to have captured the prize.  Hage, 44, was the second Canadian to have won the award, following Alistair MacLeod's 2001 win for his international bestseller, 'No GreatMischief.'  Hage, who lives in Montreal, wrote 'De Niro's Game' in his third language, English, although he is fluent in French and Arabic as well. His book was also nominated for the Scotia Bank Giller Prize, the Governor-General's Award for Fiction and the Commonwealth Writers Prize for Best First Book.  Life's losers  The novel dramatically reflects the author's Lebanese background and tells an arresting tale of two young men caught in the crossfire of a ceaseless war.  Beirut, a city under siege, provides the setting and its uncanny authenticity has been widely praised.  Expectations have thus been high for Hage's second book and the writer, who immigrated to Canada in 1992, doesn't disappoint.  'Cockroach' echoes Hage's trademark concern for life's losers, for the dispossessed, the troubled and the despairing.  'Cockroach' was among the five books on the shortlist for Canada's Giller Prize.  The narrator of 'Cockroach' is himself the cockroach. An immigrant living in Montreal, foiled and frustrated at every turn, he imagines he is a cockroach and a tough survivor, one who invades the lives and habitats of others.
