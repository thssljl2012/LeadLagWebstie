Clackamas County authorities said a Happy Valley resident chased a masked robbery suspect through a bank parking lot Tuesday afternoon and then brought him down with an NFL-style tackle.   Sheriff's Detective Jim Strovink identified the money-saving tackler as 50-year-old William Roger Onstott.   The suspect allegedly lunged at a woman walking toward a Bank of America entrance and yanked a bank bag from her hand.   The woman was taken to a hospital with injuries to her nose, hand and chest.
