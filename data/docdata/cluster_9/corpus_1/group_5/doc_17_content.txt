INDIAN RIVER COUNTY 'It's highly unusual,' said Lt. Leroy Smith of the  Sheriff's Office. 'We don't know if something spooked him. We can only speculate about why he left without any money.' The Sheriff's Office still is investigating the incident, which happened at 9 a.m. Thursday at the Riverside National Bank in the 1200 block of U.S. 1.   Investigators said the clean-shaven, white male walked into the bank wearing a yellow shirt and holding a pillowcase. The suspect waited in line until a teller window came open, Lt. Leroy Smith said. The suspect placed a note under the window demanding cash. A teller at the drive-through booth noticed the note, then had another teller contact the Sheriff's Office. The suspect fled the bank on foot, leaving without any cash.   During the investigation, a witness near U.S. 1 told detectives a man recently had walked up to him and asked for a ride to Melbourne, Smith said. The witness refused to give the man the ride, he told detectives. Smith said the hitchhiker may have been the robbery suspect.   Thursday's crime was the third bank robbery in the county this year. The Sheriff's Office charged suspects in the January robbery at SunTrust Bank in Roseland and the April robbery at the Bank of America in the 5700 block of State Road 60.   Anyone with any information about this crime should call Crime Stoppers at (800) 273-TIPS (8477).
