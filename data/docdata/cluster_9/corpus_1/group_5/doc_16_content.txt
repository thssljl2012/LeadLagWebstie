HAPPY VALLEY, Ore.The Happy Valley southeast of Portland doesn't have much in common with the Happy Valley that's home to the Penn State Nittany Lions. But they both produce good linebackers.  Clackamas County authorities said a Happy Valley resident chased a masked robbery suspect through a bank parking lot Tuesday afternoon and then brought him down with an NFL-style tackle.  Sheriff's Detective Jim Strovink identified the money-saving tackler as 50-year-old William Roger Onstott.  The suspect allegedly lunged at a woman walking toward a Bank of America entrance and yanked a bank bag from her hand.  The woman was taken to a hospital with injuries to her nose, hand and chest.
