CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Saturday's college bowl game is expected to bring $20 million into Charlotte's economy, local officials said.  Fans were out spending some of that money in Uptown Friday night.  Workers at Nix's Restaurant said they just opened two weeks ago. On Friday night there was a wait for a table and standing room only at the bar.'It's fantastic,' general manager Jason Cloud said. 'We enjoy seeing fans of any team, at any time. But this is perfect timing, right around Christmas when things are supposed to be slow in Uptown. And they're not.'Hotels were also nearing capacity. Both the Hampton and Hilton Garden Inn said they had fewer than 15 rooms lefts.  They both expected to be sold out by Saturday night.  Fans going to the game should also expect to see plenty of officers on hand.  Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said they will have just as many officers at the stadium as they would for any Panthers game.  Officers will be out in both uniform and plain clothes. Police will also man the department's camera room.  The game kicks off at 1 p.m. at Bank of America Stadium. The University of North Carolina will take on the West Virginia Mountaineers.
