The National Hockey League has fined the Toronto Maple Leafs US$500,000 and will take away their fourth-round pick at the upcoming entry draft for how they handled the signing of Jonas Frogren last summer.  The defenceman had bought out the balance of his contract with Swedish Elite League team Farjestad before immediately signing a two-year, US$2.1-million deal with the Leafs. At the time, the NHL rejected the contract, arguing that the 28-year-old had to be signed to an entry-level contract. 'He's coming anyway, no matter what,' his agent, Don Meehan, said in July. 'It's a CBA issue ... if we do grieve it, then the rules of the CBA indicate that he would operate on the terms of that contract until there's a determination made by an arbitrator as to the validity of that contract.' According to TSN, sources say that the Leafs violated the CBA for paying Frogren a US$755,000 signing bonus. It is believed that he used a portion of that amount to buy-out his contract with Farjestad.
