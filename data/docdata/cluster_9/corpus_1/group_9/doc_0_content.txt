Bank robbers pretending to have a bomb made off with about $200,000 in a brazen heist yesterday morning at a Dorchester credit union that serves Boston teachers, police and federal law enforcement said.  The FBI has joined police in investigating the robbery, which happened at  on Mount Vernon Street in Dorchester about 9:23 a.m.  FBI spokeswoman Gail Marcinkiewicz said the feds were investigating the robbery and released surveillance camera footage. She declined to comment on the amount of cash taken. We never comment on the amount of money stolen, she said. But this was a significant amount. The suspects were described as two black males in their early 20s. One was thin, with a muscular, athletic build. The crooks told employees they had a bomb in a bag, which they left at the scene, according to police.  They fled with about $200,000, police said, a big score for a bank robbery. According to the FBIs Uniform Crime Report, most bank robberies net less than $5,000. Note-passing robberies usually make off with far less - whatever is in the till - a law enforcement source said. Robberies in the hundreds of thousands are very rare.  The credit union serves Hub teachers, whose union is housed in the same building.  A message and e-mail left for a representative at  was not returned. It was unclear whether that robbery was connected to a hold-up at 10:47 a.m. yesterday at the Bank of America on Columbia Road also in Dorchester. No weapon was shown in that robbery.  The robber was described as a black or Hispanic man in his 20s, police said.
