Monster Distributes Ltd. has recently launched a new division for its inspirational programming. The brand, which will be known as Inspire, will feature inspirational programs for children.  Throughout its 10 years in the international film, television and DVD markets Monster has acquired the distribution rights to many inspirational series and features, which include THE STORYKEEPERS, HERMIE AND FRIENDS, which is the top selling DVD in the U.S. CBA market, KIDS TEN COMMANDMENTS, the Oscar nominated GIVE UP YER AUL SINS and new series, PAWS AND TALES AND ADVENTURES IN BOOGA BOOGA LAND. These series have been sold to more than 110 countries.  Inspire currently has the largest catalogue of authentic programming which entertains and inspires, using the highest quality production values. As a result of this the company is now in discussions with several broadcasters about providing a branded block of children's programming and is looking at several initiatives to build the Inspire brand and to place its programming even more widely.
