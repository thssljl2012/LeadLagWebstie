Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh has moved into the top-50 in the world rankings for the second time in his career. He is currently placed 46th after his victory at Barclays Singapore Open.  Jeev jumped 14 places and if he holds on to the position till year end, he would be guaranteed a spot at the Augusta Masters in April.  'That (top-50) was one of my big goals for the year. That it has come with three titles and the Asian Tour Order of Merit is indeed a bonus,' said Jeev.  'But I wish to improve on this win, and my goal is winning a Major.'  This year Jeev finished tied ninth at the PGA Championships, which was his best and first top-10 at a Major.  Jeev was ranked 37th at the end of 2006, but since then has slipped out of it. His invitation to Masters in 2007 was on his world ranking, but this year despite being out of top-50, the Masters organisers invited him on the strength of his showing at various events across the world.  'I am very tired but the win takes away all the fatigue and I still have some more engagements this year including the World Cup in Shenzhen and Volvo Masters of Asia,' added Jeev, who in 2006 won the Volvo Masters of Europe.  'The Majors are my goal and if I get to go to Augusta it will be superb as I have done well there past two years. It is my favourite Major,' he said.
