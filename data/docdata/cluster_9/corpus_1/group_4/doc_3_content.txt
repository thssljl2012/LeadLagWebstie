A 'violent character' has been jailed for ten years for suffocating a man in Tottenham.   Martin Kujo, 30, of Handsworth Road, Tottenham, was convicted on Friday for the manslaughter of 37-year-old Kelvin Onubogu.   Mr Onubogu was suffocated with a pillow while he was punched and kicked by Kojo with a group of men at his girlfriend's house in Higham Road, Tottenham last November.   The prosecution told the jury Kujo believed the victim owed him cash over a drugs deal.   Kujo was arrested on December 5, 2007, and later charged with murder.   Kujo, who had previously pleaded guilty to manslaughter, was cleared of murder by a jury at the Old Bailey.   On Friday a judge sentenced Kujo to ten years in prison.   DCI Jessica Wadsworth, from the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, said: 'Kujo is a violent character and I'm pleased at his conviction. 'Our thoughts are with the victim's family and I hope Kujo's conviction gives them some comfort.' Roads blighted by rat-running are to be made safer with a reduced speed limit.
