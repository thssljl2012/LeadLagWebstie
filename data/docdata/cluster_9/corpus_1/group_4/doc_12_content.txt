(New Vision/All Africa Global Media via COMTEX News Network) -- IN a bid to protect the environment, Barclays Bank Mbarara staff carried out a door-to-door campaign of collecting polythene bags (buveera) and other non-decomposing materials.   The exercise was carried out in conjunction with the Uganda Bible Institute Nyamityobora in Mbarara, the office of the Bishop of Ankole Diocese, Kakoba Division leaders and primary schools of Madrasat Nuslat and Nyamityobora.   The cleaning and burning of the buveera started at Bible institute's campus in Mbarara town.   Elisha Ekitabi, the Barclays Mbarara manager, said: 'We want to sensitise people about the dangers of buveera and help them get rid of them.'
