A gang who carried out a series of armed robberies, including one in Gloucester, which ended when police shot dead two gang members, have been jailed.  The men were part of a ruthless and violent mob who targeted security vans making cash deliveries to banks, netting 500,000 across the south of England, including cash grabbed after a raid in Hucclecote.  Raids took place at 18 locations in Oxford, Swindon, Bristol, Bath, Hampshire, Reading, Ipswich and Gloucestershire between April 2006 and September 2007.  The gang struck at Barclays Bank in Hucclecote in June 2007 in an attack identical to one in Reading the month before.  But the 18-month spree was brought to a dramatic end when a police marksman shot ringleader Mark Nunes and accomplice Andrew dead during a foiled raid in Chandler's Ford, Hampshire.  Getaway driver Terence Wallace, 26, and another gang member, Adrian Johnson, 28, today received the longest of the sentences handed down by Judge Richard Southwell at Kingston Crown Court, of 17 years apiece.  Wallace, from Raynes Park, and Johnson, from Streatham Hill, both in London, had denied conspiracy to rob.  Johnson was also convicted of a separate cashbox robbery committed last November after Nunes was shot dead.  Leroy Wilkinson, 29, from Streatham in London, who had also denied the charge, was jailed for 12 years.  Three men - Leroy Hall, 32, Leon McKenzie, 28, and Brian Henry, 32 - all from London - were given reduced sentences for pleading guilty to being part of the gang.  Hall and McKenzie were given seven-year sentences and Henry was jailed for six-and-a-half years.  Victor Iniodu, 34, from Tooting, London, who had denied conspiracy to rob, received a five-year sentence.
