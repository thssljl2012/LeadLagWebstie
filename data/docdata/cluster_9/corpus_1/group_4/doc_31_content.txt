LONDON, Nov. 17 (UPI) -- British comic actor Reg Varney, best known for his work on the TV series 'On the Buses,' has died at the age of 92, following a short illness, his family said.  Varney, who played Stan Butler on the 1970s comedy, died Sunday in the Budleigh Salterton nursing home where he was recently admitted after suffering a chest infection, his daughter Jeanne Marley told The Times of London.  'He's always been very young for his age. When he was in 'On The Buses' he was playing a 35-year-old, but he was actually 50,' Marley said of her father, who started off in show business as a singer, piano player and stand-up comic.  The Times said Varney also had the distinction of being the first person to make a withdrawal from an automated teller machine at Barclays Bank in London in 1967.  Varney's wife Lilian died in 2002. He is survived by his daughter, two grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
