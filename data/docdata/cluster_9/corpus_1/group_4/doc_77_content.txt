GAS explosive devices are the new weapon of choice for thieves intent on raiding ATMs.  Police have established strike force Piccadilly to target gangs of thieves using acetylene gas to blast ATMs to access the cash boxes inside.  After three men embarked on a two-hour rampage across Sydney early yesterday, police are investigating if a spate of similar raids in the past six weeks are linked.  Masked men blow up ATMs  It is understood three men were involved in the raids which destroyed ATMs at Penshurst, Milperra and Georges Hall between 2am and 3.10am.  The explosions propelled debris into the street and damaged adjoining buildings.  A fourth attempt at Railway Square beneath Chatswood railway station was foiled about 4am, when two passing security guards interrupted the three balaclava-clad men, who threatened the guards with a gun before escaping in a dark coloured sedan.  Police investigating another ATM gas raid at Julius St, North Ryde last Thursday, are working with the State Crime Command to see if there is a connection. 'It used to be they would ram them with a 4WD, now they've moved on to blowing them up,' Detective Inspector Ian McNab said. The highly flammable gas is considered dangerous to use and professor of chemical engineering at Newcastle University John Lucas said yesterday that 'the perpetrators of this crime must have been willing to put their lives at risk'. St George Bank machines were targeted yesterday while the ATM at North Ryde belonged to a credit union.
