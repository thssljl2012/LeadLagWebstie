It's been taken away for further testing.Police are now looking for the man who left the thermos in the bank. He's described as 188cm tall, with a slim build and was wearing glasses, a long sleeve business shirt and a long brown woolen vest. He had brown wavy hair which was neatly cut.Traffic is still blocked to southbound cars on King Wiliam St, however people have been allowed back into the buildings.Anyone with information that could assist police are asked to call CrimeStoppers on 1800 333 000.
