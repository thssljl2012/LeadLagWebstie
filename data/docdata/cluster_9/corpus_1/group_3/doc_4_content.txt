Police are hunting for a goateed man who robbed Kaitaia's ANZ Bank yesterday. Inspector Andrew Brill, of the police northern communications centre, said a fair-skinned male Maori entered the Commerce St bank about 3.50pm. The man gave a note to a teller saying he had a gun and demanding money. He was wearing a jacket with red and white stripes down the sleeves, jeans, a dark sunhat and glasses. He had a goatee beard, was of solid build and was carrying a backpack. There were five staff members in the bank and four customers, but no one was hurt. Police were still interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence at the bank at 7 o'clock last night. Staff triggered the bank's panic alarm as soon as the man left. The bank was closed for the rest of the day, with a sign in the door informing customers the branch was shut due to a robbery. Anyone with information about the robbery is urged to call Kaitaia police on (09) 408 6500.
