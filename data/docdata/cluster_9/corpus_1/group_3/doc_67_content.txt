WE CAN'T time-travel back to 1855, the peak of Victoria's gold rush, but antiquarian bookseller Kay Craddock discovered the next best thing.A decade ago, two old ladies sold her a small black diary, kept by a Ballarat gold digger, dating from July 8, 1855, to January 1, 1856.Ms Craddock's mother, Muriel, would read aloud its copperplate, close-written entries and they became rapt in what the spirited, perceptive but unnamed gold digger would do next.Kay Craddock spent more than a year transcribing the journal. It details how he ate, drank and socialised; has a Scot's meticulous account of his funds (he is believed to be from Dumbarton, Scotland); and entertaining tales of Ballarat events.The diary is on sale for $75,000 at the Australian Antiquarian Book Fair, on today and tomorrow at Malvern Town Hall. There will be 34 exhibitors selling about 17,000 items. One exhibitor, Christopher Saunders from Newnham on Severn, Britain, specialises in cricket books, including novels containing cricket. Other specialities include Egyptology, military history and bushranging.Camberwell Books and Collectibles is selling (for $75,000) a complete set - 252 volumes - of The Australasian Sketcher magazine (1873-1889) with thousands of engravings and articles on subjects such as the exploits of the Kelly Gang, shipwrecks and sport.Adelaide trader Michael Treloar is selling two albums (together, for $165,000) of photos from the 1891-92 Elder expedition into the Great Victoria Desert, including, Mr Treloar says, first-contact photos of Aborigines.Kay Craddock, an antiquarian bookseller for 43 years, helped organise the fair while moving her own shop from the basement of the Assembly Hall at 156 Collins Street, which is being renovated, to the elegant mezzanine of the former National Australia Bank building at 271 Collins, overlooking Peter Sheppard's shoe emporium.Ms Craddock says the appeal of the 1855 diary is that its observations are made by an ordinary Joe, not an aristocrat or bureaucrat. The diarist tells how a Bengal tiger escaped from a cart at the foot of Bakery Hill, entered a shop and gnawed on a leg of mutton.He says that the tiger, kept at the Montezuma Theatre, would bawl at night, and men at their diggings would answer with yells and howls of their own.On December 1, 1855, the diarist comes across the ruins of a fire in Ballarat in which 11 people died.Historian Geoffrey Blainey, who has seen the journal, says it is 'a most interesting and unusual diary'. The diary showed that during the gold rush, not only one's chances of finding gold but life itself was unpredictable. 'A lot of people died suddenly, in mining accidents or from typhoid, dysentery or whatever was passing through,' Professor Blainey said.Another volume might one day be found, he said. 'It was the kind of diary that was probably posted overseas to relatives at the end of the year and they could see everything that their kinsman or loved one was doing.' www.anzaab.com Email  Normal font Large font    RSS Feed send photos, videos &amp;amp; tip-offs to 0406 THE AGE (0406 843 243), or  us.  1224351543844-theage.com.auhttp://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/books/history-on-display-as-book-fair-airs-rarity-in-volume/2008/10/24/1224351543844.htmltheage.com.auThe Age2008-10-25History on display as book fair airs rarity in volumeCarolyn WebbEntertainmentBooks
