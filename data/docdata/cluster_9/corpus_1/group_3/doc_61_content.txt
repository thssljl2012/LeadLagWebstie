A Chorley policeman is to receive a prestigious Lancashire Police bravery award for his part in stopping four armed men from escaping the scene of a bank robbery. Sgt Mark Pass, who has been in the force for 15 years and lives with wife Marie and children Kristin, 10, and eight-year-old Jake, will join colleagues PC Frank Smith and PC Nathan Jones at County Hall, Preston, today to be presented with the William Garnett Cup. In April 2006, the trio were part of Operation Redwood which was set up after police received information that a gang from Manchester was going to carry out an armed robbery in Preston. The gang struck at the Lloyds TSB in Blackpool Road, Ashton, and were pursued by the three officers who managed to ram their car and stop them escaping. Sgt Pass smashed the drivers window with his firearm despite seeing the driver brandishing a gun, which he then discharged through the window. The offenders were then apprehended.
