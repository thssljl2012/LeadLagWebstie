A Fife man who has overcome personal tragedy is in line for a major business award.Brad Stewart from Ladybank was paralysed after a car crash that took the life of one of his best friends. But after years of unemployment set up a thriving disco business and has now been named as one of ten finalists in the 2008 Barclays Trading Places Award.The ceremony takes place tomorrow in London.He said: 'I was working as a time-served bricklayer. I was 20 years old when I had a car accident that left me paralysed from the waist down in a wheelchair which was caused by two guys who were out on the road drunk one night and I had to swerve to miss them. The car rolled and left me paralysed, my friend killed. The business side of it started just a couple of years ago when friends asked me to do parties from them then I realised I could actually make money from this.and take it a step further and go for the higher end of the mark and that's how Blitz Discos was born.'
