The launch, which celebrates the successful partnerships and formation of Kingstons CSPAN, took place at Fulham Football Clubs training ground and the Club hosted its very own torch handover ceremony, to coincide with the official hand over of the Paralympic Torch from the Paralympic Games in Beijing to London for the 2012 games. Many of the forthcoming projects were showcased including: a girls football tournament, athletics for boys and girls and boccia a paralympic sport for wheelchair users. Alistair Mackintosh, Chief Executive of Fulham Football Club, said: Fulham has a strong commitment to its local community and is passionate about the benefits sport can bring to all, so I am delighted that this funding will enable us to work with the Royal Borough of Kingston to create new sporting opportunities for young people with a disability, and to inspire young women to lead healthy and active lifestyles through sport. This funding forms part of almost 500,000 that the  has sourced to support community sport in Kingston over the coming years, and we are very grateful for the generosity of the Premier League/PFA community fund on this occasion.
