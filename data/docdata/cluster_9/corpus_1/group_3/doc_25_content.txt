Michael Montgomery Taylor thought nothing of picking up a drunk and feeding him a meal, or paying the insurance premium for a person who couldn't, or quietly helping someone else.When his beloved Mississippi Coast was whomped by Hurricane Katrina, Taylor and his wife, Elaine, created a sistership between their Sacred Heart Parish in Danville, Va., and one of the same name in D'Iberville. He made at least five Coast relief trips.Taylor died unexpectedly May 4 in Virginia of an abdominal aneurism, after spending a day on charity work, moving furniture. His last act of generosity was as an organ donor.'It seems right that Mike comes back to Biloxi,' said his wife of 40 years, whom he met when she was a nurse at Keesler Air Force Base and he was a Marine reservist. 'He loved the years we lived here.'Taylor, 61, graduated from Biloxi High in 1965, and was a reservist before beginning a 29-year career with Nationwide Insurance. He moved ahead in management, and the family - including three children born here - moved to Ohio, then Virginia. Biloxi never lost its special calling and that is why the family gathered Friday at Biloxi National Cemetery for burial.'I've learned everything from my father, with the biggest being that you try to help everybody no matter how they treat you,' said daughter Julie Ann Taylor of Biloxi. 'That and make the right decisions and be moral in what you do.'Taylor's longtime friend, the Rev. Robert Higginbotham, joined the Rev. Steve McNally of Bedford Va., Thursday for a Mass to celebrate life at Sacred Heart of D'Iberville. Several generations of Higginbotham and Taylors have remained fast friends.'Mike was a wonderful guy, very committed to his faith,' Higginbotham said. 'He had a very strong understanding that when God has blessed you, you should share blessings with others.'
