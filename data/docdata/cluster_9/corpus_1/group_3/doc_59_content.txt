ALVA ACADEMY skiing starlet Danielle Polley is already dreaming of representing Team GB at the Winter Olympics after being handpicked by Lloyds TSB to join their Local Heroes Initiative.The 16-year-old from Alva is one of 250 emerging Brits that will receive 1,000 each year in the run up to London 2012  plugging a financial gap as Polley is yet to achieve World Class lottery funding.Polley will also benefit from the knowhow of Lloyds TSB local hero mentors including former Olympic triple-jump champion Jonathan Edwards while she has already put the cash to good use investing in a new state-of-the art pair of skis.And Polley  who is being fast-tracked for 2014 success  revealed the cash injection as she prepares to jet off across the pond this winter to hone her skills in the U.S.The funding has been a great help to me. Ive been able to buy a new pair of 400 skis which have really made a difference, she said.Ive had a long training camp in France over the summer and then Im off to America at Christmas for some competitions so Im really excited at the moment.But thats a lot of travelling which can be really expensive so any help I can get I am extremely grateful for.And if things go well at Christmas hopefully I can stake my claim for the Great Britain development squad  thats the next step for me.Obviously then Id love to go to the Winter Olympics as well. That is the ultimate dream.I think Vancouver 2010 will come too soon for me but the one after that in Sochi, Russia I think is a possibility.Polley, who trains at the Escape Snow Dome in Glasgow, is set for a big future in the sport and is already part of the under-18 Scotland Ski Team.And former Olympic and World Champion Edwards, who still holds the triple jump world record, is already predicting a golden future for young Polley.There is a lot of money in sport now through the lottery but Danielle is not quite good enough just yet to take advantage, said Edwards.She still makes a huge commitment in time and money in order to do what she does and she doesnt get a lot back. This relieves a bit of pressure and gives her a boost.Sport can be lonely so when someone comes along and believes in you enough to give you 1,000 it makes you realise you will make it after all.When she was only 12 Danielle was selected for the British Skiing team, competing in several countries, so she has had excellent experience from aa young age.She also followed up two years later at the British Land National Junior and Childrens Ski Championships in Meribe, France.Lloyds TSB are providing up to 1,000 to 250 emerging young sportspeople identified each year across Britain, in the run up to London 2012 and beyond.
