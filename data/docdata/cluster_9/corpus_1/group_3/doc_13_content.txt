AFTER the success of their first concert in Diss in July, the newly-formed Merely Divas are getting ready to perform once more on Saturday, November 1 at St Mary's Church, Long Stratton.The Merely Divas feature the combined singing talents of Lisa Adamson, Sally Arnold, Kate Dann, Pippa King and Karen Stephenson under the musical direction of Michael Dann.With the huge support of Barclays Bank agreeing to match pound for pound to money raised (thanks to Lisa's involvement as a Barclays employee) the group look to have raised 1400 for Cancer Research UK from their first show and would like to thank the 150 strong audience for attending and any businesses that supported them.This time the Merely Divas will be raising money for the East Anglian Air Ambulance after David Gardiner, (a good friend of the group) fell 15 feet out of a tree and needed the services of the Air Ambulance to rush him from his Long Stratton home to the A &amp;amp; E department of the Norfolk &amp;amp; Norwich University Hospital at the beginning of September.David is well on the road to recovery and he suggested the concert by the Merely Divas to say thanks to the service.David added: I thought having a concert by the 'Divas' would be a great way of raising money to help support the wonderful service that I received from the Air Ambulance team while also giving others pleasure listening to talented performers.The concert will take place at St Mary's Church, Long Stratton, on Saturday, November 1 at 7:30pm.
