The members of East Boldon Guides, Brownies and Rainbows appealed for 50,000 to revamp their old building in Front Street, East Boldon, last autumn.Now the Guide Hall looks completely different after a 3,000 private donation, 500 from the Catherine Cookson Trust, and the staff at Barclays Bank chipped in with funding and even a bit of hard graft.The private donation, which was used to rewire the hall and buy new kitchen units, comes from Jean Barron, who is the Southampton-based aunt of the Rainbow leader, Brenda Horton.And 12 staff from the Doxford Business Park branch of Barclays Bank worked over the summer to help paint and decorate the hall.Mrs Horton, 51, from Boldon Colliery, who has been involved with East Boldon Guide Hall for 12 years, said: 'We're absolutely delighted with the donations, and after years of planning, we finally feel the project is well on its way.'Last November, Cleadon and District Rotary Club donated 1,200 to the appeal, which paid to replace the central heating boiler.Anyone who is interested in contributing to the appeal can contact Elizabeth Josephs on (0191) 519 0319. A RUN-DOWN Girl Guides' home is on its way to being transformed thanks to generous donations.
