He had been hired to run the Knicks and bring glory back to the team, but as it turned out, Isiah brought only his specialty: drama.  There's no doubt Thomas was a terrific point guard in his day, one of the best players ever. At the same time, drama clung to him in a way that defenders couldn't. It was always one thing or another, sometimes a small issue, other times a big deal, always swirling around a player and executive whose life has never been as quiet and peaceful as his voice. So now there's something else: more drama, more issues, more of the same for someone who hasn't quite separated himself from, well, himself. Sorry, but you won't read about any wild conclusion-reaching speculation here regarding the events of early Friday morning. That wouldn't be fair to Isiah or his family. Despite his short and unpopular stay with the Knicks, and the flimsy rules when it comes to celebrity and society and the right to know, he deserves a measure of compassion and privacy. In these matters, it's best to just stick to the facts and be done with it. And here are the facts: Police responded to an emergency call to his home in Westchester County and found someone unconscious but breathing. The authorities treated a man, whom sources later identified as Thomas, for a suspected overdose of sleeping pills in an act they deemed "accidental." He was taken to a White Plains hospital, treated and released. In most situations, even those involving a future Hall of Fame player, this wouldn't be more than a ripple in the curious minds of the public. But because it's Isiah, it leads elsewhere. It brings people back to the drama trail and makes them wonder if it will ever end. His reputation took a generous hit, and his post-playing career perhaps a lethal one, because of the way he ran and later coached the Knicks. He's a man trapped on his own island, albeit a luxurious one, contemplating his next move and concerned about his fate. Most certainly, and only because of his enormous pride, he likely has wondered if Isiah the coach and general manager will outweigh Isiah the player when it comes to his legacy. If Isiah is like 99 percent of other greats in the game, he cherishes that legacy. Therefore, he wants to know if people like you and I and his next possible employer will think more about what he did with the drama and less about what he did with the dribble. The drama follows him everywhere, even in exile. He was famous for the imperialistic way he ran the Pistons' locker room, where players and others in the organization saw a connection between the measure of his clout and his middle name: Lord. Isiah didn't want Adrian Dantley on the team, and just like that, as the Pistons were climbing toward a double-championship run, Dantley was gone, traded for Mark Aguirre, Isiah's most trusted confidant. Isiah also was charged with orchestrating the infamous walk-off in the final seconds of a playoff loss to Michael Jordan, and made the racially charged "just another player" comment regarding Larry Bird, and lost his future with the Pistons after rubbing owner Bill Davidson the wrong way, and was in charge when the CBA went belly-up. Then came his turbulent stay with the Knicks, where drama and Murphy's law ran rampant. He and Stephon Marbury, once tight, saw their relationship shattered. He hired Lenny Wilkens. He cost the Knicks money and cap space in trades and signings that didn't work out. He had issues with Larry Brown. And then came the guilty verdict in the Anucha Browne Sanders harassment case, which especially troubled him. Even today, his close friends and employees who worked with Browne Sanders say Isiah was railroaded in that case, but the damage was done, and more drama was heaped onto a pile that was starting to outweigh Eddy Curry. Until now, Isiah managed to get through the last few months without a hitch or a worry. He traveled, spent time with his family, played golf and by all accounts lived well. From afar, at least, he's not lacking in health or bank account. But drama? That might never leave. --- (c) 2008, day.
