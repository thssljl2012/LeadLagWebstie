The home of 18th century actor David Garrick has been gutted by fire.The blaze ripped through the Grade I listed Garrick's Villa in Hampton, south west London.The villa's roof completely collapsed during the fire and much of the first and second floors were damaged by the flames. No injuries have been reported.It took 70 fighters several hours to bring the fire under control, and as night fell, small pockets of flame were still burning.The London Fire Brigade said the fire was 'severe'.Spokesman Michael Dent said: 'Our firefighters worked hard to bring the blaze under control. This is going to be a protracted incident. The fire is now under control but the brigade will be at the scene for some time making sure that any remaining small pockets of fire have been extinguished.'Firefighters were called to the house on the banks of the River Thames. The building was being refurbished, and was still under scaffolding. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.Garrick bought the house in 1754, and it had retained many of the period features he installed, despite being converted into nine separate flats in the 1960s.English Heritage described the loss of parts of the building as a 'tragedy' saying the building was of 'national importance'.The organisation also promised to help with the restoration of the historic house.Editor's ChoicePUMPKIN workshops and fun Halloween activities will be taking place during Marwell Zoos Pumpkin Festival this October half term.Its highly unlikely Saints head coach Jan Poortvliet will ever meet up with Mary Booth, his Trojans womens hockey counterpart, on a sporting touchline.Jan Poortvliet put his sides 3-0 defeat at Swansea down to a lack of belief in the final third.A private guard working for the international shipping company DHL opened fire and killed the company's country director and his deputy before turning the gun on himself, officials said.Hull produced another stunning performance to claim an unlikely share of the Barclays Premier League lead courtesy of a 3-0 victory over West Brom.
