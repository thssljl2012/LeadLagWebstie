 FOUR men have been convicted of being part of a gang whose crime spree - which included two raids in Cherry Hinton - only ended when the mastermind and his accomplice were shot dead by police. Terence Wallace, 26, Adrian Johnson, 28, Leroy Wilkinson, 29, and Victor Iniodu, 34, all from south London, were members of a gang which targeted security vans making cash deliveries to banks, netting 500,000 across the south of England. As well as the Cambridge raids, crimes also took place in Oxford, Swindon, Bristol, Bath, Hampshire, Reading, Ipswich and in Gloucestershire between April 2006 and September 2007. The first Cherry Hinton attack took place on June 21 last year. A security guard was ambushed at knifepoint outside the Lloyds TSB bank in High Street, before being robbed of cash. Six weeks later two men grappled with a Securicor guard outside the same bank, snatching an empty cash container. But the 18-month spree was brought to a dramatic end when a police marksman shot ringleader Mark Nunes and accomplice Andrew Markland dead during a foiled raid in Chandlers Ford, Hampshire. During the month-long trial at Kingston Crown Court, the jury heard that 'luck ran out' for 35-year-old Nunes when he was gunned down as he held a pistol to the head of a security guard close to a branch of HSBC in the village. Markland, 36, was also shot dead when he tried to pick up the weapon. Getaway driver Wallace and other gang members Johnson, Wilkinson and Iniodu were found guilty by the jury yesterday of conspiracy to rob. Three other men - Leroy Hall, Leon McKenzie and Brian Henry - admitted to being part of the gang before the trial began. The whole gang will be sentenced on a date to be fixed.
