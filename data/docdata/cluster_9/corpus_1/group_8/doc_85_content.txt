CARLSBAD, Calif. -- A clumsy gunman made a failed attempt to rob a North County bank Wednesday, a police lieutenant said.  The masked thief entered the Citibank branch office on Marron Road in Carlsbad about 11 a.m., ordered everyone inside to the floor and pulled a pistol, which he dropped, Lt. Matt Magro said.  The bandit then picked up the gun, jumped over a service counter and tried in vain to open several drawers. When a teller told the man there was no money where he was looking, he fled, Magro said.  The robber, a roughly 6-foot-tall man in jeans and a dark-blue hooded sweat shirt, drove out of the area in a silver Saturn vehicle, the lieutenant said.  There was no monetary loss.
