Metro detectives believe the man who robbed a bank inside a south Nashville grocery store Wednesday afternoon is responsible for two other robberies at the same location.  Authorities said a man entered the US Bank, located inside the Publix at Nipper's Corner, just before 12:30 p.m.  He was wearing a camouflage baseball hat and sunglasses and demanded money from the bank teller.  Police said he fled with an undisclosed amount of money.  The man is also suspected in other area bank robberies.  Anyone with information on the suspect or his whereabouts is urged to call Crime Stoppers at 74-CRIME.
