WOULD-BE thieves who used an explosive device to break open an automatic teller machine in Tasmania have fled the scene empty-handed, police said.  The device was used to gain entry to an ANZ Bank ATM at the Dunkies News and Food agency on the Bass Hwy, Westbury, about 2.45am (AEDT) today.  The explosion caused significant damage to the ATM and minor damage to the shop but it was believed no money was stolen from the ATM, police said.  Witnesses saw two men running from the scene immediately after the explosion and driving north in a dark-coloured car on William Street towards Birralee Road.   Both were wearing dark clothing and full face balaclavas.  Anyone with information about the explosion is urged to contact CrimeStoppers.
