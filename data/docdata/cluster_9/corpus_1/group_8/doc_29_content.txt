Reno police are looking for a bank robber who may have red dye on the stolen money.  A 5-foot-7 white man between 20 and 30 years old robbed the Bank of America branch at a Raley's store on South Virginia about 10:45 a.m. Tuesday. Police say he handed a teller a note that indicated he was armed and demanded money.  He fled the bank with an undisclosed amount of money that may have been in a sack with an exploding dye pack.  Witnesses say he had pale skin with 'scruffy' redish-brown facial hair. He last was seen wearing a dark baseball cap, mirrored sunglasses, a grey fleece jacket, blue jeans and dark colored tennis shoes.  Anyone with information should call the FBI at 827-6600, Reno police at 334-2115 or Secret Witness at 322-4900.
