NORTH Melbourne yesterday hailed the Return of the King after officially welcoming Wayne Carey back into the fold.  As revealed by the Herald Sun last month, North confirmed the dual premiership captain would be inducted into the club's Hall of Fame later this month.   The induction comes almost seven years after Carey left the club in disgrace. 'We are very keen to have Wayne feel welcome at the club again,' North Melbourne chairman James Brayshaw said. 'He's a legend. The greatest player we've ever had . . . I think it's a terrific decision by the selectors.' Brayshaw said the club was in talks with Carey about an ongoing role at Arden St. 'It's not going to happen overnight, but I am excited by the fact that a person like Wayne Carey is going to be involved with the club again,' Brayshaw said. 'As far as an ongoing role is concerned, you never say never at a football club. 'I'm not sure at the moment the football department is where he wants to be, but I think Wayne's the sort of person that once his life is sorted out, he could have an enormous role in guiding young people on the right track.' Meanwhile, North Melbourne has announced a new partnership with the Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Group after cutting ties with the ANZ.   The Kangaroos closed an account containing $5.4 million with the ANZ after comments made by the bank's high-profile chief economist, Saul Eslake.   The club took exception to Eslake suggesting a Melbourne-North Melbourne merger, which he said would clear the way for a Tasmanian AFL team.   Despite an apology from the bank, the Roos closed the account created to house funds for the club's redevelopment at Arden St.   A spokeswoman for the ANZ said the bank believed Eslake's apology had been appropriate.   The Bendigo and Adelaide Bank will work closely with the club throughout the development of the new Arden St facility.
