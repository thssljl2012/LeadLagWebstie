Most of our readers know all about the NHL draft lottery logistics and percentages. But in case someone has forgotten, here's how it breaks down, in terms of where a team finishes overall and their chance of winning the lottery: :  29th........... 18.8%  28th........... 14.2%  27th........... 10.7%  26th............. 8.1%  [[The rest are eligible to win the lottery, but not to draft first overall]  25th............. 6.2%  24th............. 4.7%  23rd............. 3.6%  22nd............. 2.7%  21st............. 2.1%  20th............. 1.5%  19th............. 1.1%  18th............. 0.8%  17th............. 0.5%  Each of these 14 teams has a chance to win the lottery, but only the top five have a shot at getting the No. 1 selection. That's because of a provision in the CBA that says a team cannot move up more than four spots. So if the team sixth on this list (sixth from the bottom of the overall standings) hits on its 6.2 percent chance, it will get the second pick. If the seventh team on this list clicks on its 4.7 percent shot, it will get the third pick.  If you add up the percentages of the sixth through 14th worst teams, it comes to 23.2 percent. Because none of them can win the No. 1 pick, that means each of the top five teams has a 23.2 percent better chance of getting that top choice, assumed this year to be John Tavares of the London Knights. Thus, the 30th team (currently the Islanders) would have a 48.2 percent chance of drafting No. 1, The 29th team (the Lightning) would have a 42 percent probability...and so on.
