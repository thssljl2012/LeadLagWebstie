- The man claimed he needed to go back to Africa but couldn't take his sizeable inheritance with him. He wanted to give it to charity or a church.  Not really.  Whittier Police want the community to beware of bogus heirs and heiresses after three seniors recently lost a combined $27,000 in three separate incidents. Two of the victims were Whittier residents in their 80s.  Whittier Police Officer Jason Zuhlke said the scam was pulled Jan. 13 in La Habra, Jan. 15 in Irvine and Feb. 24 in Whittier.  Police explained how the elaborate ruse worked.  The victims were approached in a parking lot by a suspect who mentioned giving his big inheritance to a church or a charity.  But the man wanted proof he could trust the victim. This entailed the victim withdrawing money and driving around the block while the suspects held the cash. An accomplice would usually go through this rigmarole before the victim.  In the Jan. 13 incident, the suspect made his spiel to an elderly Whittier man in the parking lot of the Costco warehouse at 101 N. Beach Blvd. in La Habra.  Whittier Officer Mike Dekowski said the man and a woman accomplice drove with the victim to a Bank of America in Norwalk where the woman went inside. She claimed she withdrew $6000.  The suspects then convinced the victim to withdraw $6,000 from his account at the Southern California Credit Union on Greenleaf Avenue in Whittier.  He handed over the money and was told to drive around the block. When he  returned to the bank, the suspect were gone with his cash.  A woman using a similar scam fleeced an elderly woman out of $11,000 on Feb. 24. She accosted the victim in the parking lot of the Ralphs at 11825 Whittier Blvd. in Whittier.  In the Irvine incident, an 85-year-old Laguna Beach woman lost $10,000 to a man she met at a Costco parking lot who helped her with her groceries.  The man said couldn't take his $180,000 back to Africa and flashed some money at her, according to Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Jason Kravetz.  The man worried he could become a victim of a crime in Africa and also spun a tale about a grandmother being held hostage.  'He asked her if she knew a church he could donate to,' Kravetz said. The woman mentioned her church and was promised a $10,000 finder's fee.  They later met another woman who turned out to be an accomplice. She supposedly withdrew money and drove around the bank while her 'cash' was being held.  Then it was the victim's turn. As with the victim in the La Habra case, the crooks fled with her money.  One of the suspects in the La Habra case was described as a black man in his 50s, about 5 feet 7 inches tall with a thin build. His accomplice was described as a black woman about 50, 5 feet 8 inches with a medium build.  The suspect in the Whittier incident was described as a black woman with straight hair, approximately 5 feet 7 inches and weighing 190 pounds. She wore tight purple pants and large purple sunglasses.  Anyone with information is asked to call the Whittier Police Department at (562) 945-8250.
