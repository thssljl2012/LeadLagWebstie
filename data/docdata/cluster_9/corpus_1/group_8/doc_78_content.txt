In a statement released by the Panthers, GM Marty Hurney said the team has had no contact with the Patriots about a trade involving Julius Peppers. 'By the rules of the CBA we can not and have not had any conversation with other teams about Julius,' Hurney said. 'Under the exclusive franchise tag, Julius and his agent Carl Carey are within their rights to talk to other teams about a potential contract. However, at this time we are not aware of any such conversations.'
