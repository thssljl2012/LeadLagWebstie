Police say the first bank robbery of the year in Colorado Springs was planned by the branch manager.  Just before noon on Saturday a man walked into the U.S. Bank at 3505 Austin Bluffs Parkway. He showed no weapon, just a note and walked out with some cash.  Police caught up with 48-year-old Michael Martinez a short time later and say they found the money in his car.  Investigators say branch manager Evelyn Solano knows Martinez, and revealed she helped plan the heist. Both were arrested, and police say their investigation continues.
