YONKERS - Two bank tellers at the Bank of America on Roberts Avenue were treated for exposure to smoke and red dye yesterday when a dye pack used against robbers accidentally went off in a cash drawer, fire officials said today.  Empress Ambulance staffers treated the tellers at the scene after the 4:38 p.m. accident at the 176 Roberts Ave. bank, Yonkers Fire Chief William Fitzpatrick said. 'We don't know why it happened,' he said. Sensors in the packs are normally triggered only after they leave the bank, he said.  Five employees were in the bank when the accident happened, Fitzpatrick said.  There was nothing toxic in the dye packs, Fitzpatrick said.  Fitzpatrick said there are two types of dye packs, one with smoke and dye and the other with smoke and tear gas. The dye pack that went off yesterday was smoke and dye.  Some money in the bank was contaminated by the red dye, the fire chief said.  Firefighters had to open the bank's doors and use fans to air it out until the air quality was normal, Fitzpatrick said.  The bank is open today.
