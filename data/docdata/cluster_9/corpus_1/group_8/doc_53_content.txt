Posted By: Jennifer Stanton  5 hrs ago  Tampa, Florida - Tampa Fire Rescue arrived at the Bank of America building and suited up in Downtown Tampa Thursday morning.  It wasn't for an actual fire, but training for the annual Climb Tampa event. The event is sponsored by the American Lung Association.  It's the fourth year for the grueling 42 story climb with full gear.  The Tampa crew is the current champ in the team division, and they intend to keep that title.  'We don't really let that go to our heads,' says Captain Mike Shuler. 'But if we could use that for any reason, it would be to put out a challenge to other departments just to come and join the cause, raise some money for the American Lung Association and come and knock us off our pedestal.'  The single record for the 42 story climb is seven minutes and 40 seconds by a firefighter wearing full gear. The race will take place March 21st.
