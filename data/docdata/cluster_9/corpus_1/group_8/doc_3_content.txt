 WATERBURY - Legendary folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary are bringing their signature harmonies and socially-relevant songwriting back to the Palace Theater at 7:30 p.m. Thursday, March 12, in their first return performance to Waterbury, since their sold-out concert in 2007. No American folk group has lasted longer or amassed a more loyal following than Peter, Paul and Mary. During its now legendary career, the trio won five Grammys, produced thirteen Top 40 hits, as well as eight gold and five platinum albums, featuring the classic songs 'Puff (The Magic Dragon),' 'If I Had A Hammer,' and 'Where Have All the Flowers Gone.' The fact that Peter, Paul and Mary achieved such a rarefied level of commercial success without compromise, and while continuing a centuries-old tradition of raising their voices in song for the sake of freedom, is simply further evidence of their extraordinarily successful career.  Peter Yarrow, Paul Stookey and Mary Travers have spent their 47 years together communicating personal, political and social imperatives by way of their impeccably chosen songs, personally crafted harmonies and unmitigated passion.   Remarkably, more than four and a half decades after their formation, they are still singer/advocates. Their spirits and sense of purpose are undiminished and their message, if anything, is more relevant than ever before, particularly as America approaches what Travers characterizes as 'a critical turning point in time.'Tickets for the Bank of America Celebrity Series presentation of Peter, Paul and Mary, which is sponsored in part by WTNH/MyTV9, are $70, $60, $50, and $40 and can be purchased by phone at 203-755-4700, online at www.palacetheaterct.org, or in person at the Palace Theater Box Office, 100 East Main Street, Waterbury.
