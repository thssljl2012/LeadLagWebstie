To be able to bring on board a publisher of Jonathan Merkhs caliber is a wonderful opportunity for Howard Books and Simon &amp; Schuster, said Gompertz. He is well-known and highly regarded in both the CBA community and the wider world of publishing, with a substantive track record for publishing books that serve the Christian marketplace and have broad mainstream appeal. He is the right person to help us grow this area of our publishing, expanding upon the solid foundation built by John Howard and the rest of Howard Books staff.
