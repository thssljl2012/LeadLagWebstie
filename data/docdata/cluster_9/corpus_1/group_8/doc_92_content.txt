AUGUSTA, Ga. --- When you walk into Augusta Metro Federal Credit Union, you're instantly greeted at the front desk. Not only is it a warm welcome, but it's a form of security as well.  'Statistics show that anybody who's casing a potential theft of a financial institution, they're looking for the ability to slide in and slide out without much recognition,' Butch Holley said.  And this week there were two bank robberies. One at the Beech Island Credit Union, and one at the Fifth-Third Bank in Martinez. And on February 27th, the CSRA Federal Credit Union off Wheeler Road was robbed. And just days before, the Bank of America off Washington Road was hit. Each time there's a bank robbery, Butch Holley says it's a reminder to always be alert.  Augusta Metro, has more than 32 security cameras inside and outside their building. Holley says when a customer walks up to the counter, they usually don't even notice they're being recorded from the ceiling to the floor by at least six cameras at one time. Another new security measure is a biometric hand scan, which allows self service to the safe deposit vault.  Holley says the days of one large lump sum of cash being available in financial institutions are virtually gone. Say goodbye to long counters and cash drawers, now there are pods and CDU's or Cash Dispensing Units.  'So if someone came in and simply said, give me all of your money, we can't do it. We can't just open the drawer and hand you money any longer. We have to perform a transaction,' Holley said.  It's a vault, it's electronically controlled, it's bolted in through the floor, and weighs 800 pounds. Holley says it's pretty much impossible to get to the money behind that vault.
