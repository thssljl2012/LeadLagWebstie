BELLEVUE, Wash. -- If he'd tried it a few minutes earlier or later he might have pulled it off. But a would-be bank robber met his match in the former Marine standing in line nearby.   Bellevue police spokesman Greg Grannis said the incident began the afternoon of Feb. 27 at the Bank of America inside the QFC grocery store on Northeast 8th Street.   Kristopher Beal, 41, was in the bank when he saw a customer at the next window behaving strangely. He mouthed 'Are you being robbed?' to the teller, and she nodded her head.   Grannis said Beal, a former Marine who works in Bellevue, grabbed the man and threw him to the floor when he began to struggle.   Beal held the man on the ground until police arrived. When they searched him, officers found a knife, pepper spray and a flare gun, which the man had tucked in his waistband and flashed at the bank teller during the robbery attempt, Grannis said.   The unlucky robber was booked into the King County Jail and the case was referred to the prosecutor's office.'This was, we believe, a first attempt by this particular criminal,' Grannis said. 'Not particularly well thought out or accomplished.' Grannis said the department generally does not encourage people to put themselves at risk when they see a crime happening, but 'In (Beal's) case we understand that he has combat training and there was also a significant size difference.'Beal was about 8 inches taller and 40 pounds heavier than the man accused of trying to rob the bank. 'He was definitely outclassed in this case,' Grannis said. The Bellevue Police Department and the FBI plan to present Beal with a civilian merit award Wednesday afternoon. 'We're certainly grateful for his efforts,' Grannis said.
