 All it took Gabe Freeman was just one day to show his real value. Freeman, San Miguel's flamboyant import, erupted with 17 of his 40 points in the payoff period as the Beermen cruised to a 114-105 victory over Burger King in the 2009 Motolite-PBA Fiesta Cup last night at the Araneta Coliseum. The scoreboard didn't reflect the real story, though.  After erecting a huge 81-55 spread in the third period, the Beermen suddenly suffered a big fourth-quarter offensive meltdown, allowing the Titans to unload a dizzying 28-12 run that closed the gap at 94-97, less than four minutes left.  But Freeman came to the rescue, banging in 10 points, including a thunderous break-away dunk, as San Miguel averted what could have been a monumental collapse to notch its second straight victory for a share of the lead with idle Purefoods.  Burger King, meanwhile, dropped to the second spot with 2-1. "I was expecting him to provide the energy, but it was a pleasant surprise to have him scoring 40 points," Siot Tanquincen said, referring to Freeman, who capped his stellar all-around performance with 15 rebounds, one steal and one block.  A former ward of San Miguel's big-man task master Alton Lister at the Albany Patroons in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA), the 24-year-old Freeman arrived early Saturday morning as a last-minute replacement to Nate Carter, who failed to suit up following a contract dispute with his former squad. "We're very fortunate to have him, and in a way, he's a blessing in disguise (for us)," said Tanquincen. With import Shawn Daniels riding the bench down the stretch, Burger King drew strength from Arwind Santos and Beau Belga.   Daniels saw only for 25 minutes inside.   Santos poured nine of his 26 points in the final canto while Belga was a pillar of strength underneath, registering a career-high 17 points and pulling down eight caroms. They, however, failed to sustain their momentum as Freeman reduced the Titans to mere observers in his one-man showdown.
