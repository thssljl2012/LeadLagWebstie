Reporting for KRTV in Great Falls  Climbing more than 60 flights of stairs is no easy task, and adding 70 pounds to your back would make it impossible for most people.  But a group of Great Falls firefighters will be doing just that, all for a good cause.  A group of firefighters from Great Falls will be competing for the first time in the annual 'Firefighter Stairclimb' in Seattle, Washington.  On Sunday, they will race to climb 69 flights of stairs in Seattle's tallest skyscraper - with full combat gear.  The group of four has been training for three months on their days off.  Besides professional pride on the line, the firefighters are also raising money; proceeds from the event will benefit The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society.  The Great Falls team is facing some tough competition, with over 1,500 firefighters from around the world participating.  The fastest person last year climbed the 69 flights in just 11minutes, and the fastest team last year just happened to from the Missoula Fire Department.  It's not too late to make a donation to the team; call 727-8070 for more information.
