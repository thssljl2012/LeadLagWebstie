The Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota incident was, for me, the straw that broke the camel's back.  Before this sentence gets edited out, I add that the Blues (with their much-talked-about reward junket for top salespeople to the Grand Cayman Islands) certainly are not at the level of Citibank or AIG as far as mismanagement is concerned. I don't see a Bernie Madoff in the bunch, either; and BCBSND's management did turn things around as fast as a magician can pull a quarter out of your ear.
