HOENIX -- Police evacuated a Fry's grocery store after someone robbed the Bank of America inside Thursday morning.  The robber entered the Fry's on East Thomas Road around 9:45 a.m. and demanded money, a Scottsdale police representative said.  He fled with an undisclosed amount of cash, leaving a bag behind, the representative said. Police evacuated the building because they didn't know the contents of the bag.  Witnesses described the robber as a white male, 40-50 years old. He had a scruffy beard and was wearing a gray T-shirt.Copyright 2009 by . All rights reserved.
