Christian Brothers Academy students recently participated in a purple and gold dress-down day, which raised $679 for research into Chiari Malformation. Chiari Malformation is an abnormality in the lower part of the brain in which brain tissue protrudes into a person's spinal canal.  The idea to raise money for this cause was proposed by CBA sophomore Jeff Mulcahy of Kirkville, whose mother and two sisters have been diagnosed with this disease.
