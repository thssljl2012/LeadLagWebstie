Inquirer Staff Writer  JACKSON, N.J. - With 1 minute, 35 seconds left in last night's Non-Public South A boys' basketball championship at Jackson Liberty High, Holy Spirit coach Jamie Gillespie ran up the white flag.  The Spartans were trailing Christian Brothers Academy, 58-33, and it was time for the subs.  Third-seeded CBA (27-2), winner of 16 sectional titles, walked away with a 64-36 victory after running away with the game.  The Colts are scheduled to play in Saturday's final at the Ritacco Center in Toms River.  Holy Spirit (26-3), the top seed, didn't have a comparable resume, winning one sectional title in 1976. And maybe that played a part in the lopsided loss.  Some spectators said that the Spartans looked nervous and that it was hurting their shooting. That was an opinion.  The fact was that senior guard B.J. Bailey, who had been averaging 18 points per game, scored five points. And even though two other senior starters, Giovanny Perdomo and Preston Smith, each scored 11 points, the Spartans fell further behind the longer the game went on.  Gillespie didn't want Bailey or any other player talking to the media after the game, but the third-year coach praised the Colts' aggressive man defense.  'They forced us into things, and things snowballed out of control,' Gillespie said.  The coach was referring to the start of the third period, when Holy Spirit trailed, 24-18.  Perdomo nailed a three-pointer to cut the Colts' lead to 24-21, but CBA senior guard Brian Neller answered with a three. Neller, who scored a game-high 24 points, Matt McMullen (10 points), and Roy Mabrey (14) then stepped on the accelerator, and, by the end of the quarter, the Colts had a 43-25 lead.  'We talked about being more aggressive' at intermission, Gillespie said, 'but they dictated the tempo offensively and defensively.'  And there was nothing that Holy Spirit's zone defense could do to hold down CBA's horses.
