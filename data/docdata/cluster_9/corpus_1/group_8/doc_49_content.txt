TORONTO -- The headline on the blog screamed of unrest and discontent.  The Journal's David Staples, who covers the Edmonton Oilers from home, wrote that Oilers defenceman Ladislav Smid has been 'begging' to be traded out of Edmonton. 'Four times.' Later in the day it was downgraded from begging to 'Asking' but it still comes as news to Smid, who said yesterday he is quite happy in Edmonton and doesn't want out at all. 'I've never talked to anyone about wanting to be traded,' he said before last night's game. 'My girlfriend told me about (the story), that there's some guy and he's writing on the Internet that you want to be traded. I'm like ... no. No!' This is the same blogger who just had Jaromir Jagr joining Edmonton for the stretch drive, even though it contravened the rules of the NHL, CBA and Russia's Kontinental Hockey League.  The Smid blog came complete with a character analysis explaining why Smid might want out -- even though Smid says he's never met the writer. 'On the Internet, some guy is writing some (crap) about me wanting to be traded,' he said. 'You know what Edmonton is like, lots of rumours. I don't even pay attention.' An official with the Oilers said the only time Smid broached the subject of a trade was once last summer, when the Oilers added Lubomir Visnovsky and Jason Strudwick and he thought they didn't want him. 'He said last summer that if I'm not in the plans you might as well move me.' Smid, meanwhile, is feeling better after leaving last night's game with a concussion following a Nikolai Kulemin elbow on his first shift. 'He was feeling better and there was some thought of him coming back but the doctors wouldn't let him,' said MacTavish. 'But he looked OK after the game. 'He's feeling better.'
