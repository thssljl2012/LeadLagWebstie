The Broward Sheriff's Office is searching for a man with poor dental hygiene, but not because his teeth are offensive.  His offense, authorities say, is robbing banks. But his not-so-pearly whites have been a dead giveaway in a string of five bank robberies this month, three of which happened Thursday.  According to BSO spokeswoman Keyla Concepcin, the ''dirty, rotten teeth bank robber,'' has been responsible for robbing five Bank of America branches throughout Broward and Palm Beach counties.  The bank robber, who first struck on March 3, robbed three banks Thursday before 5 p.m, authorities say.Concepcin said the man was caught on camera about 11 a.m. at a bank at 1000 S. Federal Hwy. in Deerfield Beach handing a teller a note and then walking away with an unknown amount of cash.  The robber was described as a white male in his 40s-50s, about five-feet-seven, thin build, and with rotten or dirty teeth.  Detectives working the case have learned that banks in Tequesta and West Palm Beach also were robbed Thursday by a man fitting the same description.Concepcin said the same man was seen March 3 in Pompano Beach leaving a bank parking lot in a brown or rust colored Chrysler PT Cruiser.  In the Tequesta robbery Thursday, he was seeing fleeing in a faded, green, older model Ford Taurus.  Anyone with information should call Broward Crime Stoppers at 954-493-8477.  A reward of up to $1,000 is available for information leading to an arrest.
