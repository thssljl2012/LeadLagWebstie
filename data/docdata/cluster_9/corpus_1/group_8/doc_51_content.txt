A HEARTBROKEN mum and dad have paid tribute to their beautiful' daughter who died after falling down the stairs.  Hilbre High student Kim Ann Dobner, 18, slipped while staying at her boyfriend's home in Upton, Wirral, last Saturday night.  Her parents, Alison and Barry Dobner, told how their donor card carrying daughter has saved the lives of two teenage girls.  West Kirby mum Alison, 50, said: 'On Saturday she was with her boyfriend and had a curry in Hoylake.  'I offered to pick her up but she was staying over with Paul.  'Early in the morning I got a call from Arrowe Park Hospital. Paul said we should come over.  I was there for 4am and we realised just how serious it was.  'She got up in the night to go the bathroom but didn't turn the light on. She slipped in the dark and hit her head on the hard floor at the bottom of the stairs.  'People heard the thud and she was lying there.  'The ambulance service and the staff at the hospital were wonderful but the prognosis got worse  from trauma to coma to not recovering.  'She was a stunning young woman, full of life and with so many friends.  'We're so grateful to the staff who tried to save her and all the friends who have been in contact.'  Fluent Greek speaker Kim grew up on the island of Paros, returning with her mum and dad to Wirral when she was 14.  Kim was working at Chester's Bank of America before she was old enough to join the police.  The popular teen was just weeks away from her 19th birthday.  Dad Barry Dobner, 62, said: 'She was a normal teenager. She loved everyone and everyone loved her.  'She had a lovely social life with lots of good friends at Hilbre High.  Barry added that two 19-year-old girls who had been on the list had received Kim's heart and liver, and that through her death she had saved them.  And that's typical of Kim. She believed in life.'  A date for the funeral is still to be set, but Alison said she was planning a humanist ceremony.
