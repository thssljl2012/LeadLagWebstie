Officers in Georgia nabbed a Lake City bank robbery suspect Wednesday who was wanted in other bank robbery cases in north Florida and  Georgia, police reported.  Police have identified the man, shown in a surveillance photo robbing the Gleason Mall Bank of America on Feb. 23, as Leonard W. Willis, of  Jacksonville.  Willis was arrested in Lamar County, Ga., Wednesday after a high-speed chase following two Georgia bank robberies, the Lake City Police  Department reported.  Police have a warrant for Willis' arrest in the local case.  In that robbery, a man walked into the bank on U.S. 90 West just before 1 p.m. He raised up the left pocket of the hooded sweatshirt he  was wearing, told the teller he had a gun and demanded cash. He was last seen headed west on foot with the stolen money.
