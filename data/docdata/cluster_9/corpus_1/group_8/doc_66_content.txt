ATLANTA -- Mildred Carlton said she won't even go to the apartment where her child was found dead Monday. She said she simply can't.Carlton told Channel 2 Action News reporter Eric Philips she made a big mistake leaving her toddler with her boyfriend, who she had known for four months. But, she had done so before and she thought she could trust him."All I can do, every night I go to sleep, I sit up and see my baby on that bed laying down," said Carlton.Carlton said she has nightmares about what happened to her 15-month-old daughter Tynisha."She'll bring a smile to your face. She loved to dance," said Carlton.Late Monday, Carlton left the toddler with her boyfriend and the father of her unborn child, 24-year-old Walter Caldwell.  She said she went to work and then to the hospital because she was having stomach pains. She said when she returned home late that night, the door was unlocked, Caldwell was gone, and the baby was lying in the bed."I touched my baby and she was gone," said Carlton. "Oh my God, he killed her y'all. He killed her, he killed her."She said Caldwell called her and explained that a TV fell on the toddler and he had put Neosporin on her bruises. He said that she fell asleep and woke up crying and wouldn't stop, said Carlton."He told me how he put his hands around my baby's throat and killed her," said Carlton.She said she helped lure Caldwell to police, who have charged him with murder. She said she is glad that he is in police custody, but no amount of jail time will serve as atonement for her daughter's death.The family said they need help with burial expenses. If you would like to help, you can make a donation to the Tynisha Carlton Memorial Fund at any Bank of America.  Previous Stories: March 3, 2009:
