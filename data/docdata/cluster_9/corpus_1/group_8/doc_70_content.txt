By Jackson Holtz  Herald Writer MUKILTEO - Police are looking for a man who ordered customers to the ground this afternoon during a brazen bank robbery in Mukilteo. The man reportedly wore a bag over his face and pointed a gun in the air when he held up the US Bank in the 3700 block of Harbour Pointe Blvd. just before 2:30 p.m. today, Snohomish County sheriff's spokeswoman Rebecca Hover said. About a dozen customers and employees were in the bank at the time. The man ordered everyone to get on the floor except the tellers. He then demanded cash and ran away. Deputies believe he probably got into a vehicle and drove away. The area was searched but deputies didn't locate the suspect. No one was injured. The man is described as white, in his late 20s to early 30s, about 5-feet-10 and weighing about 200 pounds. He was wearing a dark Carhartt jacket, blue jeans and a blue Seahawks baseball cap. County deputies are working with the FBI to investigate. Anyone with information is asked to call the Snohomish County sheriff's tip line at 425-388-3845.
