Tucson police are looking for a man who robbed a Bank of America branch Wednesday and fled on a bicycle, a police spokeswoman said.  Banks employees reported that a man entered the bank in the 4200 block of North Oracle Road and handed a teller a note demanding money while he displayed a hammer, Officer Linda Galindo said.  The suspect left the bank with an undisclosed amount of cash and fled on a bicycle, said Galindo.  The man is described as 5 feet 8 to 5 feet 10 inches tall, 170-190 pounds and 40-50 years old.  He was last seen wearing a black shirt with white lettering, blue jeans, a blue bandanna and a wig, said Galindo.  Robbery detectives ask that anyone with information call 911 or 88-CRIME.
