Dominating under the basket against smaller foes, 6-foot-6 all-state center Michael Goodman led Christian Brothers Academy to an easy 78-42 win Friday over Section X champion Massena in a Class AA regional semifinal at Cicero-North Syracuse. Goodman finished with 12 points and 14 rebounds while playing just over half of the one-sided contest. CBA also got 16 points from junior guard Troy Bullock, 14 points from 6-3 sophomore Greg Thomson plus six points and seven assists from senior guard Stefan Thompson.   With the win, coach Buddy Wleklinski's No. 18 state-ranked Brothers (20-4) earned a return trek to C-NS today for a 1 p.m. regional title game.

At game's end, 13 CBA players had seen action.   One of the biggest cheers of the night was reserved for football receiver Yosh Karbowniczak, who swished the final basket of the game from about 15 feet for his only points of the game.
