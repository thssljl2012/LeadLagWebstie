ANDERSON, S.C. -- One week ago Friday, two young sisters lost their lives in a traffic accident.  While family members are still grieving, they have to deal with another worry: how to pay for the funeral.  The family thought the children had been covered under their mother's insurance, but it turned out they're not. While there were some donations, they still owe a lot in funeral costs.  Meanwhile, the family is still struggling with its grief.  Family members said the sisters' lives revolved around each other.'They were never apart,' a family member said. 'You couldn't separate them. They were just inseparable.'Priscilla Donald would've been 16 later this month. Lydia Donald was two years younger.  Their big brother said the bond between them was there from the beginning, and even he couldn't break them apart.'You know that no one is promised tomorrow, just how young they were proves that,' Brian Donald said.He said he got the call last Friday that his sisters had both been killed after a crash on Campbell Road in Anderson County.  The family said Priscilla had been driving for about a year. Lydia was sitting behind her in the back seat.'They are with God right now, and that's where our comfort is, just knowing where they are,' said the victim's aunt, Teresa Garrett.  Brian Donald said he hasn't been able to leave his two children since the accident. He said one of them is too young to know what's going on, but the other wants to know what happened to her aunts.'We've explained to her that they've gone to be with Jesus and we'll see them again one day,' he said.He said, no matter what, neither of them is alone.  Anyone who can help donate to the girls' funeral fund can give money to the Donald Children Memorial Fund at Bank of America, or the Lydia and Priscilla Memorial Fund at the Bank of Traveler's Rest.
