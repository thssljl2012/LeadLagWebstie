WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Detectives are searching for a man who went on a two-county robbery spree at three Bank of America branches Thursday.  According to the Broward Sheriff's Office, a man with dirty, rotten teeth robbed the three banks in Deerfield Beach, Tequesta and West Palm Beach.  Detectives said the same man robbed two other Bank of America branches in Broward County earlier this month. A Bank of America in Lighthouse Point was robbed March 16, and a Bank of America in Pompano Beach was robbed March 3.  The BSO has surveillance photos from all three robberies Thursday, as well as the March 3 robbery in Pompano Beach.  In each of the robberies, the man wore slightly different outfits, but his teeth were distinct. The man wore a Miami Dolphins hat in the Deerfield Beach robbery and was seen driving away from the Tequesta robbery in a faded green, older model Ford Taurus.  Anyone with information is asked to call the BSO.
