Morro Bay Police are looking for a man they say robbed a local bank at gunpoint Tuesday evening.  Cmdr. Tim Olivas said no one was injured when man entered the Heritage Oaks Bank branch on Morro Bay Boulevard about 5 p.m. and demaned money from the teller.  He then fled the bank on foot with an undisclosed amount of money, Olivas said.  The alleged robber is described as a white man, 35-50 years old, wearing a dark jacket, Levis jeans, light-colored baseball cap and netting material covering his face.  It was the fifth bank robbery in San Luis Obispo County in six months and the second this year. In January, an armed man robbed the First Bank of San Luis Obispo in the Marigold Shopping Center.  Olivas said it was the first such crime in Morro Bay since 2002, when the local Bank of America branch was robbed.  Crime Stoppers is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.
