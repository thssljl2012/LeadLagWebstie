I didn't hear it, so I didn't get the context, but he could mean that if they  keep  Cassel by franchising him, they won't be able to afford to keep Wilfork.

There are rules that make it harder to spread out money, but SBs can still be pro-rated (because the CBA assumes that the salary cap might be kept in future agreements).

If he doesn't like the team or what they are offering, he simply refuses to sign a long term deal with that team and kills the trade.                     Remember, though, that he'll listen to almost any other team, because they'd be able to give him something the Pats probably can't--the chance to be the long-term starter.

Sure.                      May  get a 3rd-round pick . . .  in 2010.
