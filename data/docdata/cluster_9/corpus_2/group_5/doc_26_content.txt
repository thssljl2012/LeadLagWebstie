Isn&amp;#039;t the spreading around of talent one of the reasons for a salary cap?  If revenues go down, the maximum cap goes down and some teams might be above the spending limit and they have a choice:  -take a financial penalty and stay above the cap  -trade a player or two to even the money out      I&amp;#039;d love to see the Jets go back to Winnepeg.    There&amp;#039;s gonna be another lock out in the NHL when the CBA is up again.  The cap just can&amp;#039;t keep going up and up and up because a few teams are making money and therefore skewing the numbers (Rangers, Leafs, Mtl...)    Part of me would love to see a team fold.  Perhaps then the NHL (and other sports) would learn to keep payrolls in check and possibly, just possibly, they&amp;#039;d learn how lucky they are to play a sport for a living.      -----  An eye for an eye will make us all blind - Ghandi.
