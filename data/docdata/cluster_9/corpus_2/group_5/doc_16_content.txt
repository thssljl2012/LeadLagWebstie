                        I attended a MS talk today on their Azure cloud platform ... and they basically have everything that AWS has except Devpay and FPS.&amp;nbsp; I like the way you can run all the backend stuff on a local simulator to help debug.&amp;nbsp; Amazon has a time lead though ... but MS have magnitudes more developers.   I hope Amazon sees this as the threat it is ... and stops shooting themselves in the foot by restricting devpay/fps to US bank account holders only.
