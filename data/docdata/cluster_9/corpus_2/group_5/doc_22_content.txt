I can't believe that Charlotte thinks it can compete against cities of 720K and 1.4 million people proper. Lets compete mano to mano. Atlanta is the no 1 city in the SE area of the USA, excluding FL,. I know that Nashville &amp;amp; Raleigh are moving. I am not denying Charlotte because they are getting a lot of New Jersey/New Yorker there                      If Charlotte can't compete with cities of 720K and 1.4 million, then how can Atlanta possibly compete - with a city population of 520K?  I hope you see how lame that argument sounds...     If you think Bank of America is &amp;quot;going under&amp;quot; you're insane.
