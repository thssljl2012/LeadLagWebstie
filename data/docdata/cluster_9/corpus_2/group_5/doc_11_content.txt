The franchise always talks about revitalizing the area, bringing in new jobs, businesses etc., but at the end of the day the city basically always loses money.  Now there are plenty of positives for the city in having a new stadium, but by and large cities are getting swindled by ballclubs.                      Hmmm I wonder if Washington D.C. is a first rate example of this.       The &amp;quot;Navy Yard&amp;quot; area was supposed to be renovated with the new Nats stadium opening. So far there's a 5 Guys, a Subway, a CVS, and several massively overpriced apartment buildings/condos (most of which are STILL not finished). That's it. You can still get stabbed there, and the Safeway/Bank of America up the street are probably the last grocery store or bank you'd find me in anywhere around here.
