Grrrrr, had to rearrange delivery for Monday now, he's gone home !    The guy on the phone said that "The driver was not familiar with the area, when he found it he left a card".    I have the feeling that he cba to even find my house, its a saturday and he wants an early day finish.    Good thing i have a day off, but i don't want to spend it waiting for delivery !
