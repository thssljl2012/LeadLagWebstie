  Here's a bunch of photos taken on or near Austin's Lady Bird Lake Hike and Bike Trail.  (formerly Town lake). Despite having lived in Austin for 26 years, I have never really explored the parts of the trail that are east of IH 35.      So on December 6, 2008 this 49 year-old, cigarette-smoking couch potato decided to try and walk the entire length of the trail - about 10 miles - just to see if I could make it.  I did, but just barely. So put on your walking shoes and come with me.      Not all the pictures I took that day turned out like I wanted, so in some cases I'm substituting pictures taken on other days from the same parts of the trail I walked on December 6. I've also added some other photos from November 26, 2008 from other places near the trail that offer scenic views of downtown. All photos taken Nov. 26, 2008 or Dec. 6, 2008 unless otherwise  noted in bold .      Austin's fall foliage is never spectacular, like it is in New England, but I have to admit - by Austin standards - it was pretty good this year.      My starting point was Lamar Blvd. at Barton Springs Road, where the bus dropped me off.             Across the street from the bus stop, these new apartments with ground floor retail are nearing completion.  The Binswanger Glass Company used to occupy this site at 300 S. Lamar Blvd.  From here, proceed north on Lamar Blvd to the next light at Lamar and Riverside to catch the part of the trail that runs along the south shore of Lady Bird Lake.                Crows on the patio at Taco Cabana on the southeast corner of Lamar and Riverside.  On the northeast corner is  the pedestrian bridge and the trail.             The Monarch and the James D. Pfluger Pedestrian and Bicycle Bridge, as it is officially known.  Most folks I know just call it the Lamar Pedestrian Bridge.             Lamar Blvd. Bridge taken from the pedestrian bridge.  Pedestrians used to be able to cross via the Lamar Blvd Bridge, but due to narrow sidewalks and heavy vehicular traffic it wasn't really safe.  There were numerous injuries and a few fatalities.  After the pedestrian bridge opened, the Lamar Blvd. Bridge was closed to foot traffic.             Another view of the pedestrian bridge with Spring and Monarch in the background.         From here, We're going to detour a bit to some of the scenic spots on the south side of Lady Bird Lake that aren't exactly on the trail.  Across the street (Riverside Dr.) from this section of the trail is a new section of park that opened a couple of years ago that features fountains and a 35-foot observation hill.              Spring &amp;amp; Monarch from Observation Hill.  The trail is in the foreground.             Spring from Observation Hill             Union Pacific train from Observation Hill             Spring from Observation Hill                Skyline from Observation Hill         Just east of Observation Hill is the Palmer Events Center             Skyline from Palmer Events Center             Skyline from Palmer Events Center             Frost Tower, Ashton and 100 Congress from Palmer Events Center         Just east of the Palmer Events Center is the Long Center for the Performing Arts.             Long Center for the Performing Arts             Long Center for the Performing Arts             Skyline from Long Center Garage             Spring, Monarch &amp;amp; 360 from Long Center Garage                Ashton &amp;amp; 100 Congress from Long Center Garage             Skyline from Long Center Garage         OK - Detour #1 over. Now we're back on the trail from near the Lamar Pedestrian Bridge heading east towards the South First Street Bridge, then on towards the Congress Avenue Bridge.             Trail with part of skyline visible             360 Condos             Stevie Ray Vaughn Statue with Spring and Monarch in the background on the north shore of Lady Bird Lake.              Amli 2 from Lady Bird Lake                Skyline from Lady Bird Lake Hike and Bike Trail.  The bridge at the far right is the South First Street Bridge.             Skyline through the trees.  Congress Avenue Bridge is in the distance.                Congress Ave Bridge with the Ashton, 100 Congress, and Austin's new tallest, The Austonian (under construction)             Closer view of the same three buildings             Skyline view from the Austin American-Statesman.  People gather here and on the Congress Avenue Bridge from March through November every evening to see the bats come out.         From here we can take another quick detour to the Embassy Suites Hotel at the foot of the Congress Avenue Bridge near Barton Springs Rd/Riverside Drive.  I have this thing for taking pictures from multi-story parking garages and the Embassy Suites Garage is five stories.             ZAX is a bar in the vicinity of the hotel.  I liked the artwork.               View from Embassy Suites Garage.  The Hyatt is the building in the foreground on the left.             Closer view from Embassy Suites Garage of San Jacinto Tower, the Four Seasons, and the Four Seasons Residences (under Construction)         OK, Detour #2 is over.  (Hey, I said it was a quick detour)             Now back to the trail (as seen from the Congress Avenue Bridge) heading further east towards Interstate Highway 35              Skyline from south shore of Lady Bird Lake             San Jacinto Tower, Four Seasons Hotel, Four Seasons Residences (under construction) and the Hilton Convention Center Hotel from south shore of Lady Bird Lake      This section of the trail is about 5-6 feet above the waterline in the lake and there are lots of trees between the trail and the lake itself, so you get glimpses of skyscrapers and water through the trees most of the time.  A bit further east, I glanced down and noticed these two floating platforms at haphazard angles resting against the shore that I don't remember seeing before.             Floating platforms.      I walked out on one and you can get some better views of some of the buildings because there are no trees in the way.             To the northeast is The Shore.  Lance Armstrong has a condo here.  in the foreground you can see a section of the trail on the north shore that we'll be hitting later.             Further northeast towards Interstate Highway 35 you can see The Milago (shorter building - condos) and The Legacy (taller building finishing up construction - apartments)          Back on the trail looking northeast.             Further along the trail you can glimpse the top of The Shore above the trees.         A bit further east you hit an apartment complex behind a wooden privacy fence and can go no further along the shoreline.  In some places, the terrain is too steep to support a trail and in other places, developments (mostly 1970's apartment complexes) were built too close to the shoreline prior to the current regulations and the land is private land for the use of the tenants only.  This is the start of the one and a half mile gap in the trail.        As some of the older complexes are torn down and new development goes up in the place, the new developers are required to build further back from the shoreline and either develop or pay for the development of a shoreline trail. Additionally, they could donate money which will help the city fund a boardwalk that will run along the sections of the trail where the terrain is too steep.  The city hopes to close this one and a half mile gap in the trail but it will take several years and millions of dollars to make it happen.        For now, pedestrians have to cut through the Texas Department of Transportation's parking lot over to Riverside drive and follow Riverside Drive over the IH 35 Bridge to Lakeshore Drive to pick up the trail again.          cutting through the TXDOT Parking Lot.             These apartments on Riverside Drive with ground floor retail, called The Crescent, are nearing completion.  They were built on the former site of Crescent Machinery, hence the name.      Further east on Riverside Drive is Joe's Crab Shack.  If I'm not mistaken, I think this placed used to be the Magic Time Machine Restaurant or something like that years ago (like in the 1980's).  Anyway, you can always get some good skyline photos from there.             Downtown core from Joe's Crab Shack             Towers of Town Lake (unless they changed their name to Towers of Lady Bird Lake)      A bit further east on Riverside you come to IH 35.  On the northeast corner is what's known simply as the Dog Park.  It's a big grassy shady area with lots of huge trees that's completely surrounded by a chain link fence.  Inside are lots of cheap plastic patio chairs and some kiddie pools filled with water where people can sit and chat while their dogs run and play without a leash.  I believe Edgecliff Drive is the name of the street that you turn onto to park and access the gate.  On a cliff above the dog park is an old abandoned one-story house.  There's a chain link fence around the house, but on the back side you can get some decent views of the skyline.             Skyline View.  The trail along the north shore is visible in the foreground.       The house has been abandoned for quite some time.  It probably had some killer views of the lake when it was built, but the trees and vegetation have grown and partially blocked it.  You can still see the skyline above the trees, though.        I can't believe someone hasn't bought the property and either renovated the existing house or torn down and rebuilt.  Any Austinites know the history and/or current status of that house and property? I think I read that Cactus Pryor (local celebrity) used to live there.        Since the last time I was there, someone has installed an old, wobbly, wooden park bench along the backside of the property outside the chain link fence. There was a bunch of trash lying around including one of those plastic industrial style drums, so I flipped that over, set it on the wobbly park ...
