The impact was enough to push my seat recline back a few clicks and throw my fitted ball cap from my head. We stopped and exchanged info (I got everything short of a dna sample).       I went to work with a sore lower back, neck and head ache. I took an early lunch and went to see my chiropractor. He adjusted me and is going to see me again on Monday. While there I filled out a few forms and gave them all the insurance info.      Her insurance company (Nationwide) had already called and left a message.         The damage to the car apears to be the rear bumper (has a hole from her tow hook and an imprint of her licence plate), the trunk lid housing and possible the exhaust / rear suspenion.      I am actually hoping that they can find a way to total the car due to the fact my wife has already damaged it once and I really just want an f-body or something a lot less girly to drive around.      I am much more sore today and my posture is definately affected. My neck is super sore and it hurts to support my neck (sitting up from a laying position).      Do you think there is any chance I can get compensated for pain and suffering? Not sure if I will make it into work Monday if this progesses.         TIA      -Kev                              Of course they have to pay you for pain and suffering as well as your medical bills. whether you have medical coverage or not they still have to pay you for your doctor bills. If you miss work they pay you for that too. Looks like you will be in a F-body sooner than later LOL!          P.S. It would not be too wise to speak to much about your sitiuation on a public forum. you never know who's reading it.
