You should have played past the 2nd level though to see the game to it's full potential.    Possibly but it couldnt hold my attention past the 2nd level. I see no point in continuing to play a game that i found naff, just to see IF it gets any better. I can see why people would like it however and it would be a boring world if we all liked the same things.  To me it was a poor mans resident evil/bioshock clone.    I hated bioshock, its rare i don't at least finish a game, but i cba to finish bioshock
