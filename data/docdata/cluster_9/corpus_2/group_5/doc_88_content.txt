In case you did not know last night was the Oilers 126th consecutive straight sellout so to say they are not a strong revenue team is a bit misguided. Edmonton can in fact afford superstars as the $81 million ($9M/year) offer to Hossa showed last summer. There is a lot of talk about Bouw coming home because he still lives here in the offseason and knows with a new, billionaire Oilers owner now in place the commitment to win is immediate and longterm. I'm sure he's man enough to deal with the constant media attention. In fact, I think it is the lack of attention the Panthers receive in SoFla is the reason he wants out. That said, again it was a good game to watch last night. Kudos to DeBoer for steering this ship in the right direction.     But Edmonton was one of the most vocal organizations back in the day of the fight for the new CBA, claiming that they are a small market team that doesn't have the revenues to compete. Moreover, ticket sales are but a small part of the economic picture.
