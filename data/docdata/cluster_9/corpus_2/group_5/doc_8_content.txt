Bill Armstrong, the director of Ole Miss basketball operations, was also arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, according to police reports.      A UM spokesman confirmed that Kennedy was arrested and he was meeting with athletic director Pete Boone to discuss the immediate future. It is not known whether Kennedy will coach tonight when the Rebels face No. 9-ranked Louisville in the SEC/Big East Challenge at 8 p.m at U.S. Bank Arena. The game will be nationally televised on ESPN.      According to police and court documents, Armstrong was &amp;#8220;intoxicated and ejected&amp;#8221; from the Lodge Bar in downtown Cincinnati.      Afterwards, Armstrong and Kennedy got into a cab, and the report states that Armstrong taunted the driver, &amp;#8220;in which his conduct was likely to cause a violent response.&amp;#8221;      According to police reports, Kennedy &amp;#8220;was the aggressor&amp;#8221; and punched driver Mohammed Ould Jiddou and used &amp;#8220;racial slurs.&amp;#8221;      According to the Cincinnati Enquirer, Kennedy has hired attorney Mike Allen to represent him. Allen is the former Hamilton County Prosecutor, which is where Cincinnati is located.      Allen entered a not guilty plea on behalf of his client this morning, the newspaper reported. In the report, he said Kennedy &amp;#8220;emphatically denies this and emphatically denies making any racial slurs.&amp;#8221;      Steve Kennedy, Andy&amp;#8217;s brother, said he has not talked to his brother yet but has spoken with family members, including Andy Kennedy&amp;#8217;s wife Kimber. &amp;#8220;This is one of the most unfair situations we&amp;#8217;ve ever seen,&amp;#8221; Steve Kennedy said. &amp;#8220;Andy&amp;#8217;s still got a lot of friends in Cincinnati that are going to help him fight this.&amp;#8221;
