If Nike chooses to add an incentive to Lebrons contract that pays more if he is in a large market there is little Stern or the Cavaliers could do to stop it.  However... The Knicks ARE subject to the CBA and can have nothing to do with the contract negotiations or reimburse Nike in anyway.  If they do and it gets traced back to them it would be a clear cut case of tampering and they would get nailed pretty hard for it.                        The NBA could punish the player severely for signing that type of contract, and also could file a lawsuit against the shoe company.      What do you think the NBA would do if someone publicly offered 50 million dollars to Kobe Bryant if he sat out the NBA Finals, or claimed an injury or something else?
