Now? people wouldn't give me a second look, hard to find a guild...especially when you never raided in BC before, let alone wotlk.                      In BC i was in a good raiding guild in that we had killed bosses in SSC and TK back when you had to have the trials of the naaru to enter TK but then i just one day cba'd to raid and then only was like logging in for about an hour at a time and was sbscribed for 1 month then not for 3 months.   But now im back with my guild from prebc and enjoying raiding except not getting 1 of the valorous shoulders last night and having wasted 170 or so badges on crappy enhancement gear and BoA gear instead of waiting for the pvp gear to launch
