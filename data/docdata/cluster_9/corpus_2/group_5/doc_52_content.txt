I&amp;#039;m short! And absolutely tiny in comparison to some of the people in this thread :O I&amp;#039;m only 5&amp;#039;3&amp;#039;&amp;#039;, and would look like a dwarf next to most of you lot. I gave up a long time ago trying to look tall in any situation - the only thing that works is very high heels, and I cba to go around in heels the whole time. I just accepted the fact I&amp;#039;m short!
