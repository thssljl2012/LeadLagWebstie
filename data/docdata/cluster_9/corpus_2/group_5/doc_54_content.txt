North Carolina in general is a soccer hotbed, and I'm not just talking about the ACC's college soccer dominance. The Tarheel State -- Charlotte and the Triangle especially -- has long been ahead of the curve on the footie front.                         always wanted to see a sporting event there - saw that stadium from a plane - might not be a bad option - travel wise - that airport is awesome - and a lot of flights direct to it no?         Whomever suggested the game at UT -  I know have rocky top in my head - thanks!
