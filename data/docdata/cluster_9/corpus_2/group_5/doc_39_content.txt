You'd be mad not to see it around here. You're not exactly a good Samaritan either, religious or not, who goes round accusing people of being (insert word here)?                      Hey I'm not the one dooming my self to hell by taking the lords name in vain.    And you cannot quote something you made up.  That's not what a quote is.      And you are a crap catholic, a nun would beat you silly for saying OMG (and what it stands for) and then the rest of that sentence, especially because of how you used it.      And the Samaritan helped an injured man he didn't correct his cussing, so saying I'm not a good Samaritan for my wording is a very poor link.

Good for you.  and no one but you mentioned perfect, I said catholic.
