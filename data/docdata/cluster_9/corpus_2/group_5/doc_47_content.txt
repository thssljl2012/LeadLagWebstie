I still doubt he'll sign the extension.  The biggest reason why these guys signed shortened contracts is because the collective bargaining agreement ends in 2010.  If the max contract value increases (by more than it would have in the current CBA), these guys are going to want to be able to sign a brand new contract in 2010, not be waiting for their extensions to run out.
