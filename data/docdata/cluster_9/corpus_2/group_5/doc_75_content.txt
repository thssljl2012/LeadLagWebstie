                        Quote:           BamaBoy3684                                           I hope he stays, but who could blame him for leaving if he is gonna be a first round pick in the last year before a rookie cap.                                                     I have heard a rookie cap was being discussed, but the entire salary cap expires after 2009. I do not think that there is a rookie salary cap for 2010 in place, but I could be wrong. At this point, the entire CBA is up for renegotiation. If I were a player, I wouldn&amp;#039;t factor something that nebulous into my decision...
