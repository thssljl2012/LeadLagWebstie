Kidding? Right?      The fact is that the salad days are ending for college.      It has had every possible chance to show it could provide players for over a decade with little comp or scrutiny. It has shown that 3 and 4 year players, who have little comp to get jobs, are nothing short of horrible.       As more youngsters with skill leave early, and maybe with this CBA MLS will make it easier to sign a few acadamy kids, the college 3/4 year player, even with expansion will grow less and less desirable.      They have proved to be pretty worthless overall in the pro game, despite every possible opportunity to show different.      If you have skill, or are an attackin gplayer with any pronise, if you stay for 3 or 4 years in college, your chances of real impacr/success drop dramatically. It's only gonna get worse for those guys as it's becoming clear they can't cut it in the pro game.      Remember, they have had little comp and every possible chance to show they had the goods. They have shown that they are absolute crap outside of a rare exception. As other options finally, slowly start opening up, the 3/4 year player will take his place at the end of the roster for the cheapest amount of money possibel going forward.      The writing isn't on the wall. It's written in neon lights. It's obvious. Don't think that MLS hasn't caught on.       College is a veritable wasteland if you stay past year two and you are a goal scorer/creative mid. A joke for the most part...and they have been given every chance to show different. They haven't.
