Thanks, both if you.    Double R, What you just described sounds like the same as National City. Does PNC have points rewards?      Oh well, I guess it will be ok. From what you said and what I have read about PNC, not much will change except the color of the sign. At least it won't be like Bank of America buying LaSalle, too many BOA's, sometimes two on every corner.
