        Quote (Toasts &amp;amp;#064; Sat, Dec 6 2008, 02:15pm)   I have been surviving on shit. Because I&amp;#039;m out of pot, and i have to drive like 30min to get me new. CBA.     Aww, sucks, I have to move my hand 10 cm to the left for pot.  But about having to drive 30 minutes to get new pot, it&amp;#039;s the same for me, except that I go on my bicycle. With a car I&amp;#039;d be at the nearest coffeeshop much sooner
