Bank of America Stadium was built with FIFA regulations in mind. It really is a shame Charlotte doesn't get more consideration for U.S. soccer stuff. (And for lots of other things, really. Charlotte is the biggest big city that gets overlooked as a big city.)      North Carolina in general is a soccer hotbed, and I'm not just talking about the ACC's college soccer dominance. The Tarheel State -- Charlotte and the Triangle especially -- has long been ahead of the curve on the footie front.
