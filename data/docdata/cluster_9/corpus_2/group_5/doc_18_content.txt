Tyrus Thomas is what he is and Deng looks like he might be a bad contract as of late. Toronto would take on a ton of long term salary for a superstar in Bosh.  We say no thanks and if we are dealing Bosh we can cut out the Bulls and deal with the Blazers ourselves for LMA and a package     that's exactly the thought I have, and part of it is based on discussions going on in the blazer forum. Something along the lines of aldridge, outlaw, bayless, lafrentz for Bosh + filler (kapono's contract would be to tough to swallow, but maybe)    That would be a great starting point gives Toronto a good young PF in return who could be a 20-10-1-1 player in a few years and we get a defensive SF which we need in Outlaw and a young PG in return who looks like he has a lot of promise. I wonder what kind of deal Outlaw would be looking for since he's only signed up for 2 more years. I think a lot of teams would throw the full MLE at him, I would accept that in a heartbeat if I am Toronto.   It would be hard to move Bosh but we do get on hell of a package in return maybe a first could be thrown in as a sweetner.    giving up aldridge, outlaw and bayless for bosh is a lot actually. I'm real realuctant to give up bayless (as if I have that power!), but he'd have to be included I'd guess in order for the Raps to agree. So I wouldn't want to add a 1st to it...unless you meant toronto was adding the 1st as sweetener?...     The more I think about it the more I think adding Kapono would kill it for portland. Setting aside the fact that Portland wouldn't do the deal unless they were certain Bosh was there long-term, a package of aldridge-outlaw-bayless-diogu  for bosh works cba-wise.
