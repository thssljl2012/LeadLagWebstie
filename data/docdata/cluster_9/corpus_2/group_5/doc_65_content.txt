I didn&amp;#039;t start loosing it until it started getting cold as fuck outside. When it was warm I was getting 30ish mpg. It&amp;#039;s always ran a bit on the rich side, a good 1-5 wot pull would suck down a good 1/4 tank at a time.    Nick and I only got a base map and about a 10 min tune on it. I just need to go see choung, replace the fuel filter yes, I have not since I&amp;#039;ve owned it (4 years) I have no clue on the previous owners. I need to check my plugs and do an oil change. It&amp;#039;s so freaking cold out I don&amp;#039;t feel like laying under a car. _________________      The &amp;amp;quot;banker&amp;amp;quot; for us bank @ 95th and nall, 913-649-7197, call me
