   i realize that they only care about the top tier players.  Its a basic flaw in unions as a whole.  they are supposed to care about the lowest level on up, but in reality they only care about the top level, and usually not down.     as for the signing bonus, thats a CBA thing... in the NFL i dont think it counts to the cap. Each league is different. Thats my mistake.
