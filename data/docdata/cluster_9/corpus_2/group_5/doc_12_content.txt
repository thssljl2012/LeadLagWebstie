But the last three post lets me know somebody is actually researching the information that i have posted  and verified it to be fact.Keep spreading the information and big boned j.g you are right we need more information put on flyer's. Some people that i have spoken with have said that they are rolling with teamsters. Others have stated i just can't go back to them because they didn't get to work McCormick place part time. When going further into the conversation they wanted to work it over the jg's that were on suspension.That's the reason why this officer wants AFSCME i told the officer you can kiss your seniority goodbye with AFSCME. all they have to say is operational needs of the jail and they can place anyone they want at any place they want without any drawback.Think about this,with the 75 spots that administration gets per year &amp;amp; with AFSCME operational needs soon it will be no need for a bid.This was also confirmed by a person that was at the table in negotiations that administration would like to do away with the bid. Now i already know that someone is going to state that wont happen.But if you get the last bid list and do the numbers to include the officers that got their jobs back, leave ect why does your seniority get pushed back instead of forward? Also don't forget count the spots that the administration reserves for the chosen one's.It's well over 75 granted per year per the CBA.I guess that's a scare tactic too,teamsters                      Where you referring to me? Like if the teamsters didn't get in they wouldn't take care of there people either? lol lol Oh by the way mc cormic place was giving to officers to work by the union Stewart's so if you wern`t in that click you got crap.Thats what these people are talking about,but that happened many moons ago.
