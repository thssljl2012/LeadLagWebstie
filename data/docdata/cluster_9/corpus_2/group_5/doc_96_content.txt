Without delving too deeply into the minutiae of the CBA, the short answer is &amp;quot;no.&amp;quot;          The 1st and 3rd you're thinking of is the highest RFA tender level.        Two 1sts is the price for signing a player under a  non-exclusive  franchise tag  to an offer sheet . Again, if the player is actually traded, the compensation is whatever the teams agree to.
