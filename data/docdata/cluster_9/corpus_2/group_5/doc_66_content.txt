I should clarify.  LaSalle was the &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; bank of the White Sox while Bank of America was the Cubs' and MLB's &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; bank.  When BoA bought out LaSalle, they became the White Sox bank, too.    It wasn't too long ago that the ATMs at Comiskey were from Bank One (Chase).    Bottom line: I would not worry about whether or not there will be ATMs there, they will be there.  The only issue is whose ATMs are there (fees).
