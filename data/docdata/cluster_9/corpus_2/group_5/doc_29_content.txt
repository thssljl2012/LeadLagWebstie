I thought it was December 15th when he could be traded, but is it January 1st for him?     Coldfish is correct in that common sense dictates that Gordon would never agree to a trade.  As for the raw fact as to when he theoretically *could* be traded under the CBA, perhaps since he merely took the QO he's not restricted to the 12/15 date like an extended Deng is.  Perhaps Gordon could have theoretically been traded at any time up until now.    I'm not a CBA guru though, so I don't know.  I'm just hazarding a guess.
