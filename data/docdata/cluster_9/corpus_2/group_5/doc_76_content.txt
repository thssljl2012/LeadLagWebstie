I was just looking over that thread the other day               I have a paypal, but unfortunately I am not in the KC area, so that would make it pretty difficult for me to deliver the funds to someone               Anyone have any suggestions as to who could be the banker for this?            Also, are there any nominations for a family?      Dusty and I both did this last year worked out awesome         Just went to Wal-Mart and got gift cards in the amount of the money raised, seemed to be the easiest way to go about it all             Kim (nonos) got us intouch with a family that needed help, so Jason Kim and myself gathered everything from everyone, went to walmart picked up the gift cards and delievered everything to the family. _________________      The &amp;amp;quot;banker&amp;amp;quot; for us bank @ 95th and nall, 913-649-7197, call me
