     Quote:                         Just remember you asked us to come then you spout off rules like oh if any zealot loot drops anbhas cant roll for it as the other zealot has been there more times.                     What are you even on about? Anbhas just turned 40, has 2 wards (Blimey, he's still wearing devestators) and this was his (and yours) first run in the Enclave, we said Dudikof gets his loot first because he's been there way more than you two and deserves it more than any of us there.     Heck, Anbhas was fine with it - so don't even bother bringing it up.          Quote:                         You talk to me like a piece of crap on your shoe like i have never tanked befor then when we get to the 2nd boss you want me to be leader in order to get chaos loot drops.                     First off, that's just black mojo we believe in - Nearly every group has a small &amp;quot;lucky&amp;quot; trick they do to aim at the drops they want. Second there were 4 chaos members and you already got your boots - What does it matter if we aim for chaos loot when infact, the majority of the party is chaos and you already had one drop and shouldn't ask for more?     Second, you've never tanked that boss before so we had to explain what to do - Do you seriously think you just run up, taunt and take a beat?           Quote:                         The fact is anbhas reformed the party twice and you left it. it was already late and anbhas was due to sleep befor you asked him to come anyway. So i wasnt going to mess him around any more then he had been already. You said it was going to be fast and you spent 15 mins trying to explain how this will make loot for chaos drop. For those who had the unplesant end to the evening im sorry but it was after midnight in GMT and gone 2am where he is.                     Are you kidding me? I spent 15mins explaining you what to do because this was your first run, reforming a party takes 2 seconds - don't make up stuff.  And what on earth? if you only had 20mins you should've warned us - Even though you were on after that capping keeps in DW for ages.          Quote:                         You seem to forget im locked out also so its not only you who lost out  as i did as well. You wont have to worry about next time as there wont be one ill just keep PVE guild and allys only.                     Oh my gosh, even though we tried to call you back and you ignored us you go on and complain about a lockout from a dungeon you didn't even know the way to!          Quote:                         And as for his word of warning many have done PVE with me already and they know regardless of what level i am and of what level you are or what status of influance your at i will always help to the last so its fair for everyone. So with out blowing this in to the drama hes seeking and boring the readers any more you can mail me in game or pm me if you have any problems im big enough to deal with them myself.                     At the end of the day you screwed over 4 people just because you &amp;quot;cba&amp;quot; - That's all.     I'm not even going to bother arguing with you about this, we've had problems before with eachother but this tops the cake, man.
