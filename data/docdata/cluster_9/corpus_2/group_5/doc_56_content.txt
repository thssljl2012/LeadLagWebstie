        Quote (Veilside &amp;#064; Fri, Dec 19 2008, 06:06pm)   So what exactly should my signature have then to be accepted around here? A shit &amp;quot;C4D&amp;quot;? Some bad brushing? Some slightly opaque layers that make the image not look too sharp? Should I be like 99% of the supposed artists here and follow &amp;quot;tuts&amp;quot;?  I'm not really understanding this forum, it's just the same recycled shit ideas over and over with just a few people standing out and actually making stuff that's interesting.  Hell, it's just quite funny seeing how many idiots say &amp;quot;go do some tuts&amp;quot; and expecting that to help people, I can't think of any tutorial that actually tells people what the various tools are for and how they're to be used, and that's far more important than just a step-by-step guide to making a clone of 99% of the shit here.  He's the one that said he was arty, so I'd like to see some evidence of that, it's not ym job to prove it, it's his.  I use Photoshop to make textures for 3d models and to edit photographs, I have very little interest in using it to make signatures. But whatever, if it makes you guys feel better thinking you're arty because you follow tutorials then go right on ahead.     ok so i cba to read 4 pages of text, but tuts actually helps you by explaining valuable points, teaching you how photoshop works, because by showing people certain options and what they do they actually learn more about how to get the desired result they want.
