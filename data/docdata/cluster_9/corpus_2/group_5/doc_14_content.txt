I worked with Bob for several years and he was a sweet, genuinely good guy. I even continued to see him once in a while after our company closed. This man doted on his mother, who was disabled. He took care of her every day, called home when he was out to make sure she was okay. I remember him being frantic during the North Hollywood Bank Of America shootout because that was very close to their house. This is not an evil man. Mentally ill, clearly, but not evil. His whole life was dedicated to caring for his mother. As far as I know, there was no other family. I can only imagine that when she died, he snapped. He must not have known what to do anymore. I lost touch with Bob over five years ago, as did everyone else I know from that group of ours that continued to socialize after the company&amp;#039;s closure. I wonder if perhaps all of his friends stopped calling and he retreated into his isolated house with his mother, becoming a recluse. I wonder if, had we continued to call, you would not be reading this story today. I wonder how much culpability I, and those like me, have in this situation. Instead of judging a man you have never met, please take this moment to reflect upon the people in your life who may need help and are not receiving it. Sometimes the simplest gesture can save someone.
