I&amp;#039;m just a youngster (I was 4 in 1979) but here are my two tales of crowd surging.  Funny as it sounds, my bad experience came at Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds acoustic show at Millet at Miami U in Oxford (before anyone makes any snide remarks, I was there with my wife because it was what I gave her for Valentines Day that year).  Anyway so we were by far the oldest people there and I think we were in our late 20&amp;#039;s at the time.  Same thing that Friz said, they insisted on sending everyone through metal detectors and cavity searching us all.  So there were still like 5,000 people outside when Dave starts playing, and the crowd just surged.  I immediately thought of The Who and I grabbed my wife and we just tried to slide to the edge of the crowd.  It&amp;#039;s a very shitty feeling to have a million tons of force pushing you where you don&amp;#039;t want to go.  I can&amp;#039;t imagine....        My second tale is the scene of the crime, US Bank Arena, 2006.  I went to see NIN and was in the fan club, so I scored early entry and nabbed a spot on the rail.  Well, NIN takes the stage, and the crowd surges forward and I instantly feel like all of my ribs are broken.  Fuck that, I&amp;#039;m too old for that shit, and I know once &amp;amp;quot;March of the Pigs&amp;amp;quot; starts up, I&amp;#039;m going to be fucked, so I got the hell out of there before they got to that song.        Now I&amp;#039;m content to either sit in a reserved seat or see someone like Wolf Parade or The National with only a couple hundred of my closest friends instead of thousands.      Man that was long.
