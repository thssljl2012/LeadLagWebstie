  Since you mentioned Jungle Island - I had my reception there and we LOVED it.  People can&amp;#039;t stop talking about our wedding and the food/service/etc. was excellent.  There are pictures below my siggy pic.  They also have outdoor spaces available so there are some options you can play around with.  Our contact person there was Jannette Alix.    I think the other girls have listed a ton of great ideas.  I must admot that the Performing Arts Center idea totally intrigues me.  The only other place I can think of is in Dowtown Miami - the Bank of America building has a rooftop space.  HTH               E-Pics       Wedding Pics    Our big day...
