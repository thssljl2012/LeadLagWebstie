Washington is over the cap, so they HAVE to send out some salary to acquire Critt.  Also, as a realist, you have to question the credibility of a blog. ANYONE can spread whatever rumor they like.  UPDATE: Sure enough, a three-way deal involving Critt just went down. I figured WAS would give either Daniels or Thomas, and they did send Antonio to NOH. Props to the blogger, but he needs to get his CBA facts straight.    Actually, the blogger never said the Wiz wouldn&amp;#039;t be sending anyone out.  What he said is that Memphis wasn&amp;#039;t taking back any players.  Which is  exactly  what happened.
