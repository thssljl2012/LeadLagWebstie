Had I kept   my   '03, it would have been paid off April 2008 along with the wife's 2005 Jeep Liberty Limited 4x4 CRD that I just paid off in October (hard to beat the 3.49% I had thru US Bank on the '03 and the 0.00% on the 48 month loan of the CRD).      Occasionally I find myself asking &amp;quot;Why did I sell my '03?&amp;quot;   Had 51k miles on the '03 and 20k miles on the 2007.5, so I'd be at 71k miles on my little 305*555.      Still I love the Blue Bus............      Greg
