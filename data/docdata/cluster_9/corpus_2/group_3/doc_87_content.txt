You&amp;#039;ve been consistent on this point that is frequently made - in a way noting that there&amp;#039;s almost ALWAYS a way to find the money to pay for a player if that player is deemed a priority.      I don&amp;#039;t disagree - but I think your point is only valid in the context of a well run organization like the Patriots.      BECAUSE the Patriots are a fiscally responsible organization, who don&amp;#039;t overspend for players, and in fact seem to have a clear idea of what value they place at certain positions, they in fact DO have the flexibility you speak of.      And while I appreciate the ability of a Capologist to defer cap impact until future years, at SOME POINT irresponsible spending does catch up with a team, and DOES limit their ability to afford expensive players.   That impact has certainly been lessened by the most recent CBA and the influx of money and increasing salary cap, but it also seems like the owners are intent on reigning that in by calling for a new CBA - so one can&amp;#039;t count on the same rate of increase either (assuming they don&amp;#039;t do away with the cap entirely, which I hope they don&amp;#039;t)      For example, does San Francisco&amp;#039;s status having $11 million tied up in backup Quarterbacks have no impact on their ability to spend like drunken sailors at other positions as well?  While they can cut Smith they still have to accept the salary cap hit.  Keep making moves like that and eventually it catches up with you - especially if other teams can outbid you and grab the players you want - and even more so if a new CBA limits the increase in the salary cap.      So while I think your point is valid, at the end of the day, there&amp;#039;s a reason why Belichick traded back in this draft and did not want to pay a high guaranteed salary to a player he didn&amp;#039;t believe was worth it at #7 - instead getting the player he wanted cheaper and later in the draft.
