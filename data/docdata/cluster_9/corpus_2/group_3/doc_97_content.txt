Maybe I&amp;#039;m in the minority but I&amp;#039;m hugely disappointed by it. I played the original on the PC and then Instincts on the xbox. I rented the new xbox version from xtra-vision for a tenner and after 2 days I realised it&amp;#039;s just like playing &amp;amp;quot;just cause&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;GTA&amp;amp;quot; with it&amp;#039;s safe houses, multi vehicle use and arms dealers.       The plot line also seems drawn out and boring and I&amp;#039;m only about 3 or 4 major missions in. Also the diamonds are annoyingly hard to find outside of quests.      I think i&amp;#039;ll be returning it to see if I can get something else for the rest of my weeks rental as I really cba with it (and i used to play instincts for hours at a time and loved it).
