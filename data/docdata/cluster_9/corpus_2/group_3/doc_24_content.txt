 'Streets + Spaces' (pedestrianisation, etc)   19 million   U/C - Page 34 - SkyscraperCity       Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  s_d                         Now if only they could do the same with Humberstone Gate, it looks too old and run down next to the new look High Street, Gallowtree Gate and Clock Tower Square.       Actually, the other day I noticed for the first time how much I like the huge building opposite Haymarket, where M&amp;amp;amp;S, JJB and (soon) Barclays are. I think it&amp;#039;s called St Georges Towers right? Anyway, if it actually housed some nice names other than M&amp;amp;amp;S I would love it. I hadn&amp;#039;t noticed before that I like the look of the building itself. Except the green bit perched on top of it, it&amp;#039;s so out of place. They should recolour it. Do the same with the odd green bits on top of Highcross (Shires area) as well.                      Haymarket Towers.
