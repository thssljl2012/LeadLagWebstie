            I need a one day rental to pick up sparco seats!       I got quote from enterprise and they charge me extra $15 for age between 21-25 (i&amp;#039;m 22). the total would be around $53      so is there other renting places that do not charge extra $15? Also would it be good to have one day insurace for another extra $15? (i have full insurance coverage from nationwide...)      driving from MD to PA (around 130mile round trip)
