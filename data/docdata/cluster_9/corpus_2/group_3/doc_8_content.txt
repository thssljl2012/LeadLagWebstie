I wouldn&amp;#039;t recommend working for a newb with no book.  If you are going to start out with no book, you might as well start out on your own.  The advantage of StateFarm is normally you get to work with an agent who has a book already so you have business just coming in on it&amp;#039;s own which will allow you to survive while you are a newb.
