That happens sometimes with the &amp;amp;quot;testing&amp;amp;quot; version.  There&amp;#039;s a reason   they call it that.  If you wait a while the new library should show up.      Maybe.  In sarge and etch, wallp version is 0.64-7, in lenny and sid it   is 0.64-7+b1.                 A lot of stuff depends on imlib though.  Since major things like gtk    aren&amp;#039;t broken it sounds like maybe this &amp;amp;quot;wallp&amp;amp;quot; is ahead of the curve    rather than behind it 8-&amp;amp;gt;         --     -  Comrade Bob Hauck    -  Proud part owner of the People&amp;#039;s Insurance Company (formerly AIG)    -   http://www.haucks.org/
