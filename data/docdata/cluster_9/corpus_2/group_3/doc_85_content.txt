If you have your own rower and an internet connection it doesn&amp;#039;t make sense not to do battle with WinXP / WinVista and RowPro. 2. Do you follow a training plan, if so which one? 3. Do you record your PBs? 4. Do you log your times on   http://www.concept2.com/sranking03/log.asp   including things like the Skeleton Row (31K between 25th and 31st Oct) and Holiday Challenge (100K or 200K between US Thanksgiving and Xmas)? 5. Do you log times on   http://www.nonathlon.com/   ? 6. Have you joined   http://www.concept2.co.uk/challengeseries/   (2K this month, 1mile in Nov) 7. Are you a regular in the CTC   http://www.c2ctc.com/   (500m,1K,2K,1k,500m this month)? 8. Have you thought of joining a virtual online team? Some teams have no entry criteria. Some are more strict about membership. See   http://concept2.co.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=12   9. What other sports do you do? 10. Have you done all the ranking distances? including a 60&amp;#039;, HM or FM? 11. How long do you have per day, per week for a workout? 12. Have you ever been on the water? Do you live near an OTW rowing club? 13. And your 2K time is? 14. Row whilst wearing only a thong, with the ergo in the front garden.
