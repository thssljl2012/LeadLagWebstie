 Hi,      I used the following code to display the toolbar, in my AppUi&amp;#039;s ConstructL():      CAknToolbar *tbar = CurrentFixedToolbar();   //tbar-&amp;amp;gt;SetDimmed(ETrue);   tbar-&amp;amp;gt;SetToolbarVisibility(ETrue);   tbar-&amp;amp;gt;SetToolbarObserver(this);      A few things I discovered:   - in landscape layout, it seems you must have a toolbar, if you don&amp;#039;t, the toolbar&amp;#039;s real estate on the screen is occupied by a what looks like an empty tool bar (darker though) and a tap on that area will send your app to background. My workaround for that is to have an empty toolbar in resource, make it visible and call SetDimmed(ETrue) on it if in landscape.      - in portrait, if you&amp;#039;re not using the toolbar, you have to set it invisible otherwise it will always show and occupy some space.      This was useful for me as I could not support toolbars yet in my app so I hope it will help others people porting to S60v5.      Olivier
