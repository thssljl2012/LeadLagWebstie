We got our ecake from Woolies.  It was choc mud and delicious.  I dunno where abouts you are, but if you&amp;#039;re close to Browns Plains (on the southside) there&amp;#039;s a lady there that makes awesome cakes.  We always order from her for our kids birthdays.   She&amp;#039;s &amp;amp;quot;All About Cakes&amp;amp;quot; and she is near the ANZ bank on Grand Plaza Drive.  We usually order on a Wednesday to pick up on Saturday morning.  Good luck
