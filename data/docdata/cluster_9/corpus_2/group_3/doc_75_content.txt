One of my friends from college just left his job to become a SF Agent. All he has talked about is how great of an opportunity it is and how they only take the best of the best and on and on. I was a little skeptical of the whole deal, because of others that I know who are agents and because my friend is definitely not &amp;amp;quot;The best of the best&amp;amp;quot;....anyway, he has already completed his training and taken all of the tests and has now been given an office of a retired agent. He definitely thinks he is on the way to riches, but after reading this forum, it sounds like he may have been suckered. I have tried to tell him to be careful, but I don&amp;#039;t want to seam like I am pissing on his parade. He turned down a 75k a year job, because he deemed SF to be &amp;amp;quot;way more lucrative&amp;amp;quot; I guess my question is....is he really being suckered into this, or is it really as great as he thinks? I just can&amp;#039;t imagine agents making that kind of money (He says 120k+) and it being as easy as it was for him. It seams to me that if it was that easy, every college graduate would be doing it. What am I missing here? Thanks in advance.                      He did not do his due diligence.  He wasn&amp;#039;t suckered he was just shown the positive and past performance.  He didn&amp;#039;t do his due diligence and does not understand the current downside.
