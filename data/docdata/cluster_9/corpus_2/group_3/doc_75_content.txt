I started making this at around 7pm yesterday, finished it 13 hours later and it&amp;#039;s sounding pretty sweet I think:  Beam , or try  putfile  if that doesn&amp;#039;t work.  I kept turning down the volume of the hi hats because they were irritating after a while. I think I made them too quiet.  Actually the whole track sounds kind of muffled...I cba to fix it and reupload though - EDIT:  Yes I can. Updated above link also.
