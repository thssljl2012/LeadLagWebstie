But it&amp;#039;s just taken me an hour to eat my dinner cause I&amp;#039;m so nauseous. Fucksake. I just cba.                      If you feel that bad then just don&amp;#039;t go.  You&amp;#039;re not well so it&amp;#039;s not like you&amp;#039;re making crap excuses.  Just tell them you&amp;#039;re sick and then curl up under your duvet with the telly or something.
