Every year, I look forward to BillySims&amp;#039; latest draft pick scheme/scenario that nets the Lions a gazillion choices or multiple 1st round picks.  Once again, he has not let me down. Atleast this year, it doesn&amp;#039;t involve drafting half the Michigan offense.            Wanting to trade down is one thing, but finding a willing trading partner is quite another.  Most teams don&amp;#039;t want to give up additional picks and/or pay the higher salary required to move up.  The only time it happens is if a team is absolutely in love with a particular player and is afraid another team will select him before them.  If you&amp;#039;re lucky, you may be able to trade down twice, but more than that simply isn&amp;#039;t realistic.        Unfortunately, the huge contracts given to rookies has now made it all the way to the 8th overall pick.  I&amp;#039;d imagine that it will include the top ten players next year.  On the bright side, it isn&amp;#039;t as much of a price difference going from #6 to #2 as it used to be, so we could see more trades amongst the top ten than we have in the past.  Luckily, these outrageous rookie contracts should be coming to an end soon.  I have no doubt that there will be a strict rookie salary cap included in the next CBA.  This could happen as soon as this spring or in 2010, but I don&amp;#039;t think it will take effect until the following year. _________________ 2007 Lionbacker Yahoo Fantasy Football League Champion!
