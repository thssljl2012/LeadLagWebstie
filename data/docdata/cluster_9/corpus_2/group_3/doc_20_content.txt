 Mosley Street   55m   13 floors - Page 15 - SkyscraperCity       Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  PeterNixon                         Not been to Manchester in a while now, but can&amp;#039;t wait to return to see the likes of this.      Just out of interest, will the height of this building have been limited by planning regulations, or does the developer not want to go any higher?      This building really adds to the little cluster developing around there, and I think it would be great if you could see it from further away, all that glass complimenting the city tower.                      Good question. I reckon its what the developer wanted to do. Over the way there is Chancery Place which is abit taller but that Barclays building next door is asking for the demo boys to move in. There are a number of options in that area for the future.
