 Wow, what a mess!  I&amp;#039;ve been out of the country and have missed most of this.  Reading your post, Sophie, made me realize that I have part of my insurance with AIG.  I guess I should check that out.  Eek.      Sunny, I can&amp;#039;t believe they yanked your posting rights away with no warning.  What was the offensive photo?      I&amp;#039;m feeling like I don&amp;#039;t want to go back home!!  But I want to get back in time to vote.  Then maybe I&amp;#039;ll have to leave again after election day........         I just arrived in Paris.  I feel like I&amp;#039;ve been out of town forever.  Well, it&amp;#039;s been almost a month, so that&amp;#039;s a lot.  Wish I wasn&amp;#039;t moving around so much, though, so I could have some sort of food and exercise routine.  As it is, I&amp;#039;m at the mercy of people and situations somewhat out of my control.      Well, I&amp;#039;d better crash.  I&amp;#039;m wiped.  More later!
