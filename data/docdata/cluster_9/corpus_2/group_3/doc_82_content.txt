One case so you come along and try to make claims that everyone who smokes a spliff will end up a heroin addict.      What utter nonsense!      Over-emotional clapcrap!      I smoked cannabis as a teenager and now have about two beers at the weekend and that&amp;#039; it! And I know 100s of people like me.      Right wing interfering busybody parents.      Personally I think that they should give mental stability tests to any parents who actually think that way.
