         We&amp;#039;re talking Rio for this trip, baby!  (oops -- did I say that out loud?)   AIG Board Member  ==================  Next week&amp;#039;s meeting has more of an educational component than the St. Regis meeting, he said.  ===================== When I went to the bank (I know AIG is an insurance co..whatever) I asked them if they got trips like this for their training/education programs.  They said they were really lucky if they got a cold cut tray and bread instead of brown bag ready made sandwiches.    FWIW, they did say the WAY upper management might.  So much for trickle down.
