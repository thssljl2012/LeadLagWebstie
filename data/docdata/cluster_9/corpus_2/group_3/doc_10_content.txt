  http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/b ... ref=sircrc       I just don&amp;#039;t see why this would happen. Why would he get paid more for not playing than if he&amp;#039;d (for example) made the team and been cut before the guarantee date in January? And what happens to the second, fully unguaranteed year of his deal?  Does Richards have quirky language, is there some kind of CBA clause that I don&amp;#039;t know of, or has the reporter just misfired?
