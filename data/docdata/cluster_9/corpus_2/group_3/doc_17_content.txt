I lost around 3 stone on a ketosis diet myself, so I know that they are effective, I know that they work.   The OP is not asking for a full diet to lose fat/weight, just about a protein shake. He does not need to be eating every few hours (like you mentioned), he can get away with an extra chicken breast with a main meal, or a couple of extra eggs or whatever.                      well actually i said he doesn&amp;#039;t need to eat every few hours, as for the OP, read the thread title, he asked how important exercise is to losing weight, the threads about losing weight.  He asked if a protein shake would be good for breakfast, you said you should have carbs for breakfast.  I said omega 3&amp;#039;s , b vits, and egg&amp;#039;d being the best choice for breakfast and that carbs aren&amp;#039;t a great idea and you jumped down my throat for recommended ketosis and then telling him to fast.      As he&amp;#039;s now actually said in his post, and as was expected by me, he&amp;#039;s said cooking meals without carbs can be tricky(more because as a culture we are so used to cooking with carbs as the bulk of the meal, rather than it actually being difficult, we just need to learn new recipes tbh) and that a shake eliminates the need to come up with another carbless meal.  hence,  shakes aren&amp;#039;t a problem.
