           And I&amp;#039;m not talking about your wife catching you playing with your girlfriend. And I&amp;#039;m not talking about a golf ball rolling past you, or being hit over your head, or stupidly playing in a thunderstorm... I&amp;#039;m talking about seeing your life pass before your eyes.       It&amp;#039;s amazing we don&amp;#039;t get killed out there... my history, 4 episodes.     2 in one day:    1990, caddying at 18 yrs old. In the rough (stupidly 40 yds in front) of a player who is hitting back to the fwy. The ball rockets up in the air, hits a tree branch and passes through my legs at about 100 mph. I learned my lesson that day.      Waiting at edge of fwy forecaddying for the teebox. A group comes up the adjacent hole and the player doesn&amp;#039;t bother telling me he&amp;#039;s about to hit. He hit a wood from about 40 yds away, in the rough, and it nails my golf bag. That was the last day I caddied.       1991, playing at a public course . The group on a parallel (but opposite direction) hole is playing. As I am walking off the tee a player hooks his drive over the trees to us. He doesn&amp;#039;t yell fore. All I saw was the ball land, and bounce (still going 80mph or more) and literally just by a hair nick my nose as it zips by. It actually left a micro scratch. Millimeters from disaster.       This last month , marshalling at the  Barclays PGA  (the one where Sergio lost to Vijay in overtime). Kevin Sutherland is the 3rd to last group hitting off the 18th tee. It&amp;#039;s a dogleg right over trees. I can see his ball going right towards the trees and the large gallery where I&amp;#039;m standing. I yell &amp;amp;quot;fore right!&amp;amp;quot;.. as I turn 90 degrees to my left to look for the ball to land it zips within an inch past my chest (I felt the wind) at about 100 mph. Had I not turned literally 1 second before, it would have hit me smack in the middle of my chest.      Man what a dangerous sport!
