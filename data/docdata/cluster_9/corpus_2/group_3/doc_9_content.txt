My guild is just going to be doing 10mans in wotlk, we never had quite enough people for 25 mans sadly. Mainly cuz as you said cba with idiots in the guild.      Plus the guys and gals in my guild are what you would call a &amp;amp;quot;tightly knit bunch&amp;amp;quot; we all get on really well with eachother like to chat alot etc. So the 10/25 man thing when we heard about it was more than happy. It means will can see the whole game rather than being a tad restricted.
