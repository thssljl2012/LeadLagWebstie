     Yeah, the driver insists to go Tan Cheong as he feels that its the correct procedure and reported to the insurance company AIG. I already told him that we can settle privately and he said that he&amp;#039;ll contact me again and when he did, he said he already called up AIG to file the incident....what the hell? I mean yeah, even if its my fault, he could have called me before doing that right? I understand how one feels when ur rear has been hit but seriously, in the first place the road was slippery and I was driving with care already and that person&amp;#039;s left rear lamp was also out so it was quite hard to see....By the time I jammed my brakes, the car just lost grip and slided into his rear...Suay sia....
