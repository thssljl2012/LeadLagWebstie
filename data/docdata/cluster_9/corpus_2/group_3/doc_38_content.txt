I hope this makes sense to someone - I have searched the threads and tried figuring out a way around this (especially from this thread:  http://www.zen-cart.com/forum/showth...=101404&amp;amp;amp;page=2  ) but I just can&amp;#039;t make any difference   The Problem:      I want my categories / products to be listed in alphabetical order, going from left to right, but whatever I try to change they go in alphabetical order from right to left. So I want them to be like this:      ABC   DEF   GHI      but they are always coming out like this:      CBA   FED   IHG      So they are in a  kind of  alphabetical order - but not quite!      Can anyone help with this??      Stuart
