Been there done that still get days when CBA kicks in. Change the routine a little. Get out of a rut and start a new one. With MrsRR + Jr being up in Glasgow the last few weeks I&amp;#039;ve changed my routine a couple of times. First few weeks still got up early and trained then went for a swim and sauna then trained again later. this week I&amp;#039;ve took the chance to get more rest and train later according to client appointments. Today I&amp;#039;ll traion at 11:30 and then again at 3pm still getting my 2 sessions in. + I&amp;#039;m getting an extra couple of hours in bed! Bonus time. RR
