I know he&amp;#039;s headed off to San Pedro tomorrow morning to install some doors on a boat. Besides... I dont know if he can ride right now. Our life insurance was/is thru AIG and I dont know if its lost $$ or what??                        Well, let me know when his life insurance is good to go and I&amp;#039;ll take him riding.    Then I&amp;#039;ll take you for a ride.
