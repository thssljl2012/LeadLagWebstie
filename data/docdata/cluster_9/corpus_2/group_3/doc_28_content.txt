I&amp;#039;ve never heard of this one.    1) remove plate from microwave 2) completely cover the bottom of the microwave with marshmallows, or cover a board that won&amp;#039;t move at all 3) put the microwave on. 5 seconds is about enough, maybe 10 4) take ruler, measure distance between 2 most burnt/melted bits of marshmallow, in a direction paralell to coming out of the grille inside the microwave 5) take this distance in metres, and multiply by the frequency in Hz which should be on the back of the microwave 6) that value should be close to the speed of light. obviously errors in it.  NB: Fuck BBCODE, i cba
