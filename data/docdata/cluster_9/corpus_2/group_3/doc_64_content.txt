Unfortunately you won&amp;amp;#039;t get far unless you send your work out! I understand your concerns - went through it myself, but as I&amp;amp;#039;ve learned, having your work stolen is unlikely. If it should happen, then providing you keep your backup work, early drafts etc. then you should be covered.      If you are really worried though, you may be able to lodge a copy of your work with your bank. I know that Barclays provide this service. You lock your valuables or whatever into a plastic tub which then goes into a vault and is stored for about 20 a year. The beauty of this is that the zip locks on the tub are dated, and so a record is there of when you put it into storage.      Try getting an agent first, as they&amp;amp;#039;ll know where best to place your work. Get a copy of The Writers&amp;amp;#039; and Artists&amp;amp;#039; Yearbook - it&amp;amp;#039;s got all the info you need.
