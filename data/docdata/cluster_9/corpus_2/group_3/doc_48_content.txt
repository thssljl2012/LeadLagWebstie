But I&amp;#039;m getting bored and going through an attack of can&amp;#039;t be arsed.  I want to stick with it. I&amp;#039;m not the type that jumps feet first into a new activity and then just as quickly ditches it and moves on to the next. But a few times lately I&amp;#039;ve got part way through a workout and just pulled out, thinking, well, CBA.  I&amp;#039;m not competitive and don&amp;#039;t care about BIRC or my 2k time, I just want to freshen it up a bit.  Anyone been there and come out the other end? Tips, advice?    For what its worth I&amp;#039;ve been there many a time and its difficult ,but remember the only person you are competing against in you.  Just think about the last time you had a PB and how good you felt!!  Advice would be to join a team either virtual or otherwise, there is a good bunch of people out there who want you to do well, the rest is up to you.  Also, I often read the blogs as there you can see how other people get on, some have good days and some have bad.  For what its worth.... stick at it.... you can race me on Row pro if you like any Sat morning, quite happy to lose!!
