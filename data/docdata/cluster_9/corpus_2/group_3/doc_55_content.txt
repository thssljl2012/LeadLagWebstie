Just finished this game... Well, the missions. CBA to do it 100%. Gonna flog it and still get a good price for it hopefully        Ohh and don&amp;#039;t forget to do the secret mission at the end                        Also, if its like the first SR you get multipliers for using a cop car and for the amount of witnesses that see you go flying.      I only picked this game up tonight so I can&amp;#039;t say for sure if this is still the case.
