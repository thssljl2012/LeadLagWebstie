  This avenue would have created some significant cap problems. With JR on the books, either Monta or Biedrins would be gone. Remember, they did not think Davis was going to have the stones to opt out.   They would only be gone if Cohan said so. They still would have been RFA&amp;#039;s and the Warriors would have had the right to match any offer they received. The CBA is very specific in that it gives teams the highest opportunity to re-sign their own players.
