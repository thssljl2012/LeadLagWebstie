Ever since Thomas has retired from playing basketball he has been on a path of destruction.  And everything he has touched has turn to crap. See: Continental Basketball Association ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Isiah Thomas years (1999-2001)  As of 1999, the CBA had survived for 54 years. That year all the league&amp;#039;s teams were purchased by an investment group led by former NBA star Isiah Thomas. The combined ownership plan was unsuccessful, and by 2001, the CBA declared bankruptcy and ceased operations. Several of its teams briefly joined the now defunct International Basketball League.
