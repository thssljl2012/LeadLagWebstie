I really really wish people would just stop complaining about everything.        First we have loads of lvl 70&amp;#039;s complaining that they are bored because they are sick of dailys and they have nothing else to do. Then Blizz get this fantastic (and time-consuming) idea to implement achievements. Some are easy to get, others take some serious work (but have rewards and titles).       Now people are complaining that there is too much grinding! imo if you want something you should have to work for it!!! Whether in game or in RL! If you cba with that then just leave it and do something else.      (This is not aimed at the OP btw . .. I&amp;#039;m just sick of hearing the complaints everywhere I go)      /sigh
