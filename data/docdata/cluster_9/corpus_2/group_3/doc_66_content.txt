 You mean the amount of dots a suit of Artifact armour is rated?        I say no. But this is a topic that&amp;#039;s long been debated.        One of the things people always bring up is how much better Power Armour is. Except that Armour of the Immaculate Dragons and Celestial Battle Armour both require Hearthstones. This is a frequently glossed over detail. Without a Hearthstone the armour is useless, and while it is plugged in to the armour, the stone is useless.        This effectively makes CBA and Dragon Armour more expensive than their dot ratings indicate.        A few other details that help even things out. Every suit of Artifact Armour does a better job at its primary purpose than Power Armour of equivalent dot-rating, that purpose being to provide Soak and Hardness. The only type of power armour to get MM bonuses is CBA, which is also the most expensive when you consider the Hearthstone issue.        And as for the only real flaw in Artifact Armour, the lack of Hearthstone sockets, that is easily handled by using the recommended mofication of adding a numberr of them equal to the dot-rating -1. _________________ I swear I&amp;#039;m only here for the comedy value these days. -Wyrdly        Do you just keep a constant stream of junk running through your head, then occasionally drop the needle and type whatever gets picked up? -hls
