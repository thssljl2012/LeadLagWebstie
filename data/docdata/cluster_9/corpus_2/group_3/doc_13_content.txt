Seriously, don&amp;#039;t buy fucking soap, even if there&amp;#039;s nothing about. It&amp;#039;s really, really not worth it.    If you must consume that shite, make brownies.                       Pretty much this, might be worth giving it a clean first however. Google is yer mate here, I cba with links at this time of the morning.
