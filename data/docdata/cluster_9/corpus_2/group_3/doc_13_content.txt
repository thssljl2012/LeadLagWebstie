i live near norwich and they have a pub called the murderers in its city centre, while i am saddened i am not suprised as provincial english towns are notoriously violent at night even in leiscter square in central london a similar thing happened to a barclays employee a few years ago. The uk citizen has no rights to bear arms and handguns are illegal since several masacres in schools ect, so the violent yob fears no one not even the police, who are usually racist skin heads anyway.
