I&amp;#039;ve done the Googling myself.  In the search facility for Google maps, there&amp;#039;s a Barclays on 45 Passieg de Gracia.  I can&amp;#039;t seem to locate a Santander nearby, but there&amp;#039;s a Banesto on 37 Passeig de Gracia.  I believe the two are partners in Spain.  37 and 45 are, however, numerically not right next to each other.      I can&amp;#039;t be 100% sure that these are two banks, but if I remember correctly that one is Barclays, then this should be one of them, as I can&amp;#039;t imagine that there are multiple Barclays branches on Passeig de Gracia.    When I read Fodor&amp;#039;s and participate in Fodor&amp;#039;s, I sometimes get the impression that the attitude here is &amp;amp;quot;guilty until proven innocent.&amp;amp;quot;  It&amp;#039;s really rather ridiculous, in my opinion.      I think that I&amp;#039;ve posted here enough to establish that I am a real person who travels to Europe a few times a year.  And that I&amp;#039;m capable of traveling to Prado and back to the airport within a four-hour layover to see an art show on Patinir, and all this is humanly possible, unlike some people seem to think!  Wink.
