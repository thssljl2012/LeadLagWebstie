I am anything but a fan of unions, but I do realize they can be needed in some situations.  Right now it just seems like the NFL is slapping their employees around just to remind them who&amp;#039;s their daddy.    MLB&amp;#039;s union is out of control and the NFL union is a joke.  You would think a middle could be found?    If I was a player getting fined for having a small 21 written on my face, I&amp;#039;d not be happy.  If I was a player getting fined for legal hits, I would not be happy.  I think the actions of this current commissioner are going to come back and haunt the NFL owners.  Eventually the player will say enough is a enough and there will be a serious gap in the next CBA negotiations.  I would not be shocked if there is a strike under this commish Goodall.   oh god dont say strike!! i do think your right though. there should be some middle ground for both unions
