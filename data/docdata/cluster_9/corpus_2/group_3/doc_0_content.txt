You&amp;#039;re right, that is quite a stupid design.  If the fields were stored as proper booleans then you could simply SUM() and COUNT() each column.    One column can be queried at a time:       Code:      select content_explained, count(*) from eval_cba_trial_evolution group by content_explained        I&amp;#039;m not certain that it&amp;#039;s even possible to do the whole survey using one query.
