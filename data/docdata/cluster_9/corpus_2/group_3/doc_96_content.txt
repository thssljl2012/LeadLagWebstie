 A commercial I mentioned in the Olympics thread, where it was shown practically every other commercial break, and very quickly drove me crazy...well, it&amp;#039;s still around. I will not even post the ad (if it&amp;#039;s up at YouTube) because I don&amp;#039;t want to subject anyone to it who hasn&amp;#039;t seen it.       It&amp;#039;s the Nationwide Insurance commercial where the stupid guy attempts to make a parking space between two parked cars by grinding against an elderly couple&amp;#039;s vehicle. When apologizing for doing the callous thing he did, he is set upon by the irate granny, who beats him senseless with her purse, egged on by the husband. I hate, hate, HATE this commercial. But...it wasn&amp;#039;t always this way. Once,  once , it was funny. But now it&amp;#039;s on every channel, sandwiched between every show. I know there is no way you people out there have missed it, unless you totally mute or zip through DVR&amp;#039;d ads. Please, someone else tell me you hate this one.      EDIT: It was just on AGAIN! I&amp;#039;m watching CSI: NY and halfway through, there it is. I couldn&amp;#039;t hit mute fast enough.
