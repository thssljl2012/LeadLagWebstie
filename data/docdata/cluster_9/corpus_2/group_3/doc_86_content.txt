            Also, some S2000s use a lot of oil when new (although relatively much better for later models than the originals).  Just top it up.  I&amp;#039;ve decided to stick with some of that cheapo The Edge oil (although I spit feathers at the U2 connection&amp;amp;#33;) since I CBA to complicate matters with dealers and three cars.  Also, if I operate on a total loss basis (like a Wankel) maybe I won&amp;#039;t have to do any more interim oil changes - VTEC engines really shit their oil as the miles go on.  Actually, maybe the &amp;#039;Lude&amp;#039;s breather &amp;amp;amp; gizzard need a clean; it does like to drink its own oil that way.
