Loads of food for thought there. Thanks guys.  I&amp;#039;ve heard of Nonathlon, CTC etc but associated them with the wild-eyed lean-limbed hardcore types rather than the casual paddler. Clearly, I need to find out more. Ditto the various challenges, and ditto RowPro, although I think connectivity issues might make that difficult (but certainly worth checking out).  I log distances rather than times. I&amp;#039;m a slow aerobic type rather than fast anaerobic. 2K pb is 7 mins and &amp;amp;lt;cough cough ahem&amp;amp;gt;.  Main motivation: recovery and cross training for running - half and full marathon. And to burn the calories because I do like pies. But as I get older I&amp;#039;m appreciating the non-impact aspect of erging. Three sessions a week, usually, about an hour including warmup and warmdown.  I don&amp;#039;t follow a training plan as such but have plundered the Pete Plan for workout ideas. That is a great resource - respect and regards to the man himself.  So - The Plan. Off home to Cornwall shortly for a few days to wear myself out doing something completely different - surfing and waveskiing, no erg in sight. Investigate those links. Then back and incorporate as much as I can from them and the workout ideas given above.  Thanks again!
