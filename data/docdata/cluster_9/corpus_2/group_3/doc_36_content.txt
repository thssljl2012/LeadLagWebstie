 After reading  Lehman Excel snafu could cost Barclays dear &amp;amp;nbsp;a couple of questionsabout excel came back to me.    Why is the default setting  copy all cells  and not  copy all visible cells....?     And why can&amp;#039;t you change the default setting.....?    Why is there&amp;amp;nbsp;no shortcut or toolbarbutton for this....?&amp;amp;nbsp;    In my opinion copy all visible cells is more intuitive and less dangerous.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Jelle-Jeroen Lamkamp
