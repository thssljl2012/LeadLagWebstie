If you&amp;#039;re studying John&amp;#039;s Gospel, the Steve Ray study is outstanding.  It&amp;#039;s in tremendous depth, provides historical and theological instruction, and references to the CCC, the Church Fathers, and the Old and New Testament.  It&amp;#039;s outstanding.  In my study we use this, Barclays, and the Hahn Ignatius study, and this one is the best by a long shot.               http://www.catholic-convert.com/Default.aspx?tabid=101
