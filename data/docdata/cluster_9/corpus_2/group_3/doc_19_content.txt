Salaries have to match up within 25% plus I think, 150,000 bucks, so Marbs 21.937 million dollar deal (disgusting amount of money), would have to get back (if my figures are correct) just over 16.3 million in return.   - - -   having read up on this, I don&amp;#039;t think a trade with NY is likely.    Warriors will ask for Lee (and malik - expiring) - knicks will say no   Knicks will offer curry - to cut salary for 2010, warriors will say no.    Every scenario I look at doesn&amp;#039;t seem to work.    Dolan is not in a salary eating mood these days.    Harrington isn&amp;#039;t a bad fit because his contract expires by 2010, but would GS take on salary?   probably not.  Would NY?   probably not.   Would NY give up Lee?   No.  Would NY give up Nate?    Maybe, but my guess is that Dantoni likes Nate as much as Al, maybe more.   Malik &amp;amp;amp; Nate for Al is the fairest deal I can think of (2nd round pick is discussible), but I&amp;#039;m not sure either team does it.   and the Knicks are rebuilding, so adding Al doesn&amp;#039;t make that much sense, a player we might just let leave the team in 2 years if we got him.     But if you guys want curry, I think that&amp;#039;s the knicks offer.   Probalby won&amp;#039;t happen.
