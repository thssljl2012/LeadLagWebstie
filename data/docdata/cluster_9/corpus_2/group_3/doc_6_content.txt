I heard his phone beep..     he&amp;#039;s sleeping   But I&amp;#039;ll go tell him...         I know he&amp;#039;s headed off to San Pedro tomorrow morning to install some doors on a boat. Besides... I dont know if he can ride right now. Our life insurance was/is thru AIG and I dont know if its lost $$ or what??
