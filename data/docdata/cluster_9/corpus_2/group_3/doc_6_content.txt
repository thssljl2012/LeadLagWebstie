 Hi,      I am trying to develop an application on S60 5th edition SDK. If I compile and run a 3rd edition application as-it-is, it shows 3 extra, blank buttons in landscape mode (between left and right softkeys). I have been trying to access it, to either hide it or put some operational buttons but I have been unsuccessful. So, the following questions: -      1. What is that 3 extra buttons? Is it a TOOLBAR, AVKON_TOOLBAR, CBA (some extension to it)?   2. What resources should I add/edit for this control? I have tried many things but nothing seems to work.      If someone could point me to a detailed document somewhere or an example code, that would be great. BTW, I have gone through the SDK and its documents but couldn&amp;#039;t work out anything regarding this.      Thanks a lot,   Kumar
