If he failed to mention about his driver&amp;#039;s job in his autobiography(if that is true) then kotecha need not get upset. If kotecha is trying to say that the gentleman did not earn his rich status through rightful means then that needs to be proved. But kotecha will not go ahead to prove it..     See,this is why I refer to you as an ignoramus. Gordon Wavamunnu states in his autobiogarphy (ghost written of course) that he owned a string of dry cleaners and transport companies in Western and Central Uganda since 1966. He used to drive me to bloody Barclays Bank in 1967.  Now stop getting your chuddy in a twist, and go to sleep watoto.  I don&amp;#039;t want to now get into pointless debate with you.
