I wanted to fit one in my M4, but I heard quite a few unsavory things about the amount of wear and tear on the mechbox. Only thing is, I couldn&amp;#039;t ascertain the kind of box they have. I&amp;#039;m thinking, from some of the pictures I saw, that they were standard TM boxes, whereas my M4 is running a Systema reinforced box, with the 7mm bearings rather than the solid bushes.      the last full weekend mil-sim I was at was Last Strike. I&amp;#039;m going to be going to the next TA event if I can, though. Taking the M82 and AW338. CBA with assault weapons after the really enjoyable sniping experience I had at LS.
