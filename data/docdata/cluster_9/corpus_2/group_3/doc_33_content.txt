did you know the Church of England was recently denouncing bankers for short selling HBOS shares..... surprise surprise, the Church of England are a major shareholder in HBOS! They also have shares in Barclays Bank            To me it seems that the institutions of organised religion often say one thing about money to their followers while their own leaders are busy doing the opposite!        Basically they are in a catch 22. They can publicly renounce money all they like but who will pay for the rent, fancy clothes, candles, heating bills, gold leaf etc. Somebody has to!        If they are short on cash they can always tell everyone to go home, sit quietly, lock the door, light a candle and do an hour of silent thinking for themselves. It costs tuppence and would still have the desired effect!
