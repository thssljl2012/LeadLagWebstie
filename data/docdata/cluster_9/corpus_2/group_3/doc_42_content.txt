The point is that if you&amp;#039;re not the team negotiating the deal with him, you have no voice in the terms of the agreement.  You can match it.  That&amp;#039;s it.  Beyond that, he can walk early and if he&amp;#039;s not happy with your franchise, then it&amp;#039;s become an unnecessary risk.  That&amp;#039;s the point.        If the Lakers negotiate the deal, they can have a considerable hand in the terms, including the years.  If another team is negotiating the deal, then the fact that they&amp;#039;re trying to lure a player away means that player will have a stronger voice than normal, were he just negotiating an extension with his current team.                         I agree with this statement - no &amp;#039;ifs&amp;#039; or &amp;#039;buts&amp;#039; about it.        Why this &amp;#039;after 3 years&amp;#039; point is so important (well, to me personally - that if I&amp;#039;d have to give Drew an advice   )? Because then it strengthens Drew&amp;#039;s negotiation position as well as earning potential.         Whoever advised LeBron to take 3+1 was a very wise man (or woman) (later Bosh, Wade, Melo followed as well as CPaul DWilliams recently).         First of all, it gives them an option to become FA when their &amp;#039;ceiling&amp;#039; increases based on the &amp;#039;years of service clause&amp;#039; for FA.    Secondly, it gives Drew (as a player) a chance to assess his relationships with the franchise as well as direction franchise is going.    And, lastly, it gives a chance to re-negotiate a deal (hopefully, on better terms for him) when and if any changes will take place when current CBA expires and re-negotiated with the players union. This one is very risky though - based on current clubs&amp;#039; earnings (or losses, to be more accurate) it is very likely (IMHO) that new CBA will be even more strict towards players&amp;#039; earnings.        Anyhow - if Drew&amp;#039;s camp is so confident in his ability as you and I are - 3 +1 should be their requirement of the new deal, not 5 years extension.        From the Lakers POV (assuming that this year unfolds the way all of us, Lakers fans, want it to) - it&amp;#039;s not a desirable outcome. Yet, it&amp;#039;s something that they have to live with as a compromise... _________________ &amp;amp;quot;I guarantee you, guarantee, Kobe will not be traded. Put that in your sig for me.
