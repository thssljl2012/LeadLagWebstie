   Thats a shame.  People shooting on their own rural property are common here in South Carolina.  When I was single and in law enforcement, me and two other officers rented a house which sat on several acres of green fields near Pocatalico, SC.  There was a woods line behind the house and a fire lane cut through it.  Being firearms instructors, we decided to set up a range and hone our skills every evening while supper cooked.  It wasn&amp;#039;t long before everybody else in the area was using our fire lane and abiding by standard safety rules  and nobody was ever hurt.  Something tells me that if we had a swimming pool, there would have been more risk and yet no question by an insurance company.  This whole thing sounds more like a  gun issue  than a  safety issue.
