Can&amp;#039;t is not a wise word to use with Andrei.  It is well established that he has enjoyed his greatest success with the Russian National Team, and is a legend in his home country. We also know that Russian league owners&amp;#039; &amp;amp;quot;oil money&amp;amp;quot; has supplied 8-figure (US$) contracts to much lesser players this offseason (Boki Nachbar among them). The NBA CBA has no recourse if Andrei wants to leave; there isn&amp;#039;t even a buyout clause in NBA contracts (there should be though).  If AK47 wants to go, you can consider him gone. This fact, along with his horrendous contract, make him hard to move.
