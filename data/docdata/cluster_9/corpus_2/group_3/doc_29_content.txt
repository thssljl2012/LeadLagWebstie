I mean, dude, you did totally blow up one of the NBA&amp;#039;s storied franchises, hit on the staff and basically looked stupid, but life goes on. Having your daughter take the heat for your meltdown is beyond the pale.  What&amp;#039;s next, a Ford Bronco police chase in LA?    I knew I never liked him.                      Don&amp;#039;t forget about him running the CBA into the ground before that (where is that league now?) and essentially thinking he was &amp;#039;The Best&amp;#039; player at his position in the NBA when he wasn&amp;#039;t even close.  I never liked Isaiah Thomas.  He was always too much of a thug, and he showed OVER AND OVER that he had very poor judgment, but he talked a big story and some people bought into it.    So, who&amp;#039;s the bigger fool?  The fool himself?  Of the fool (fools) who buy into his foolishness and let him run wild and DESTROY?
