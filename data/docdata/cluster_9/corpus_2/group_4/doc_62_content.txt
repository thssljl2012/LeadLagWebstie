Living in Socal I&amp;#039;ve seen or not seen Brand with the Clips for years. He&amp;#039;s nowhere near the player people havehyped him to be. The Sixers can&amp;#039;t get out of their own way. When you consider it only takes 5 decent players playing together, and they can&amp;#039;t manage that, then it&amp;#039;s a hopeless franchise. This team is garbage. I watched the Lakers win their 6th straight at Dallas last night, and they are truly a good team. The Sixers will be lucky to hang forone quarter against them.The Sixers couldn&amp;#039;t win in the CBA, or old ABA. Cheeks is a FRAUD as a head coach. This guy should be a bench coach at best. They are the dregs of the Eastern confernce, at present. Having said that they started bad last year, as well. Will it get better? We&amp;#039;ll see.
