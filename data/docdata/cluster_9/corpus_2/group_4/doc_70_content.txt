                                                                    if Weekes was the answer, he would have played him more in the last two years... regardless of Brodeur&amp;#039;s wishes. Now, he is going to have a trial by fire and he may be slightly panicked!      Nope    Loophole Lou is a smart man, he knows people come to see The Brodeur.  Nothing sells tix like The Brodeur going for the record, everyone wants to be there the nite it happens.   Marketing baby, that&amp;#039;s where it&amp;#039;s at!  $$$$$$$$$$$$$ talks    Maybe we could trade them Roli for a copy of Loophole Lou&amp;#039;s best kept CBA loophole secrets.
