But if you were to go into a scenario and proceeded to DPS, which you have every right to do, how many of those very same people would deride you for not performing the role they expect of you?      When you join a group, whether PvE, RvR or scenario, there is an unspoken contract between yourself and the other members of that group.  The DPS provides the killing force that scores the points, the healers provide the ability to continue applying that force and the tanks provide the protection to both the healers and DPS.  When one of those people drop group to keep the RP/XP to themselves those other people are still there doing their job and enabling the dropout to continue what they&amp;#039;re doing, however, they&amp;#039;re not fulfilling their part of the deal.      When you and I heal, we&amp;#039;re paying the DPS for the xp/rp and the tanks for protection in health points, the tanks are paying in damage taken on our behalf for the healing and for the kill credits to the DPS.  People who drop out of groups aren&amp;#039;t paying their bill....if you have no problem with this, then maybe I can send some homeless people round to squat in your house
