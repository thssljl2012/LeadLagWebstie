He did mention some of the things they&amp;#039;re looking to address, but he didn&amp;#039;t really give too much in specifics as far as how they&amp;#039;re going to address them. Hopefully on Friday we&amp;#039;ll get some specific changes. I&amp;#039;d like to see them address who the expansion cities are (may be too soon), how they plan to fix congested schedules, and some changes to encourage more team pulling up players from their academies.    In the current economy, the plan to not significantly change the salary cap isn&amp;#039;t a surprise and I understand the rationalization behind not expanding the roster size if the cap isn&amp;#039;t changing much. The new CBA is where those changes will likely occur anyway.
