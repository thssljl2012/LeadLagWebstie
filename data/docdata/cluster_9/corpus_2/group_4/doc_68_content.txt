Whenever I come here (the Laker team forum) I am astounded at the difference in demeanor between the long time L.A. fans, and the ridiculous trolls on the main board. The OP would have been torn apart for making a simple mistake on ISH proper, and you guys were not only helpful, but complete gentlemen about the whole thing. It&amp;#039;s unfortunate so many gimmick accounts choose a Lakers/Kobe theme, and give you guys a bad name.
