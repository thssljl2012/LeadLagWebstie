 Hi I&amp;#039;m working on a calendar and happy to see that the new layout has Australian Events.  However there are two errors in the 2009 dates,  both for WA.         The events are:    Mon 2nd Feb as Labour Day [WA]  it should be Mon 2nd Mar    Mon Oct 5th Queens Birthday [WA] it should be Mon Sep 28        Please see WA Gov site to verify.  http://www.docep.wa.gov.au/LabourRelations/Content/Wages%20and%20Leave/Holidays/index.htm         There are a number of other public holidays missing.  The reserve bank of australia site has a complete list of 2009 Australian Public Holidays (ignore any that say New York, or London   )   http://www.rba.gov.au/EventsDiary/bank_holidays_2009.html         lulu if you could at a minimum fix the errors with WA that would be good, if you can add the other Public Holidays that would be great           Tony.
