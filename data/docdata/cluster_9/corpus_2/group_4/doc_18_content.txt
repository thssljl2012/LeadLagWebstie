 Britton has said that he doesn&amp;#039;t think he&amp;#039;s going to come out.  He will consider it if Arizona makes it to a bowl game.  At 6-3 right now with Oregon, Oregon State, and Arizona State left on the schedule it looks like they&amp;#039;ve got a good chance at making a bowl.  As jebrick said, with all the uncertainty with the CBA negotiations it&amp;#039;s probably in his best interest to come out.        I&amp;#039;ve only seen 2 AZ games and I&amp;#039;m not that great at evaluating OL, but from what I saw he gets a pretty good push in the run game and has a packs a pretty good first punch.  I&amp;#039;m not sure about his hips or his footwork though.
