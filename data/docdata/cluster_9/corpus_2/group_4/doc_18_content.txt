It&amp;#039;s a guy sliding down a massive water slide on the outside of the building and he gets scanned on the way down. Its by Barclays bank. Basically saying &amp;amp;quot; welcome to a cashless society&amp;amp;quot;. It&amp;#039;s all coming together for them. They  are bringing it in very slowly and in a fun cool way. Don&amp;#039;t take the mark of the devil. We will be forced to take it, but don&amp;#039;t give up your right to be a human, and have a natural body with nothing put inside it.                      hello and welcome to the forums milston1    I have seen the Barclay card advert for the contact less card but what is really interesting is a show called  the gadget show  where they were saying how cool this new type technology is and they were talking about a microchip under the skin to pay for stuff   The presenter was saying its cool and everyone should have one or you wont be hip     looks like they have started on the campaign aimed at the kids     If I can find a link to the show I&amp;#039;ll post it, But I&amp;#039;ve not been able to find it so far                                                 __________________       ---------TRUE FREEDOM STARTS WITH LOVE----------
