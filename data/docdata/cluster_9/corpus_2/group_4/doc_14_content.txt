Posting this because Clooney news is a bit slow at the moment.    Remember the photos of George on the yacht and at Bono&amp;#039;s house in the south of France with Cindy and Rande and the blonde in the funny hat, well this is her, maybe she isn&amp;#039;t as ditzy as we all thought. Underneath that rather vulgar appearance might lurk a shrewd brain.     A story found on the Mail Online site 3rd Nov 2008  ____________________________________________________________________________    The banker, his wife and a 7 billion deal    Influential: Dijana Jenkins    Dijana Jenkins, glamorous Bosnian-born wife of the Barclays executive behind the 7billion recapitalising of the High Street bank. It was her social skills that opened the doors for her banker husband Roger, who runs Barclays Capital&amp;#039;s investment management business in the Middle East.     A former athlete, Jenkins attributes his wife&amp;#039;s networking success to laying the groundwork for securing Qatari backing for the deal. Dijana, 36, a regular on the Hollywood party circuit  -  friends include George Clooney and Brad Pitt, is close to the wife of Qatar&amp;#039;s prime minister, Sheikh Hamad, the key figure in the investment.     Brought up in Sarajevo, where her brother was killed in the bloody civil war, she was a student at London&amp;#039;s City University when she met her husband, who was then teaching.     A mother of two, Dijana  -  who is shortly to be appointed ambassador at large for her native Bosnia  -  gave 2.5million of Jenkins&amp;#039; fortune to the University of California to support the trials of Balkan war criminals by promoting international law.
