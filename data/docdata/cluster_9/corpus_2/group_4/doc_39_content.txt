I feel they should probably get another pick; and I think they are handling it as classy as they can.   BUT, I think it way too soon to be making issue of this - that it will be hard, if not impossible, for the organization to avoid this coming off as insensitive.  So I would certainly agree with anyone who feels the opposite.      larger question though, if you believe they should not be compensated.  where do you draw the line?   Should player deaths (sean taylor) be treated the same as holdouts, suspensions, injuries, defections, etc?  tough topic.                           I missed this, thanks for sharing.      I don&amp;#039;t think they deserve another pick.  I draw the line in that he was drafted already.  The CBA thing referenced in the article seems to be playing with what clearly is not the intent of the agreement.  Of course they can&amp;#039;t sign him.  It&amp;#039;s unfortunate, but I really don&amp;#039;t think they should get another pick.
