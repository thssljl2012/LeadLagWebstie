 From the article on nba.com,          http://www.nba.com/2008/news/11/03/nuggets.pistons.trade.ap/index.html         the buyout is for only half of what he is owed!!!   He must hate Denver with a passion if he willing to leave over 6mil on the table so he can return to Detroit in 30 days.        For all of you CBA gurus out there, if Mcdyess agrees to his contract buyout where Denver only pays him 6.5mil of the 13mil he is owed, what does his cap number look like for Denver for this year and next??
