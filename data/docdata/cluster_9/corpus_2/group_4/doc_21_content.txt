So Europeans come to the U.S. for the french fries? Or perhaps the $7,000,000 purses every week?        This reminds me of the time a reporter asked Michael Schumacher if he would ever race the Indianapolis 500. He gave the guy a curious look and said, &amp;amp;quot;Why?&amp;amp;quot;       If  I  were a touring pro, Europe and other parts of the world would be on my schedule, but a lot of my countrymen don&amp;#039;t have my experiences or interest in foreign countries. If you were playing on the no. 1 tour on earth, why would you go off to play halfway around the world for half the money unless someone paid you to?
