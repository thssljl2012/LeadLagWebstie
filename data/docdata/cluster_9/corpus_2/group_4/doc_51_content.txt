there is a reference thread that gts posted in our forum that is stickied.  it has a great review of the NBA salary cap and might help you to understand some of this better... its very complicated so don&amp;#039;t feel like you are alone... there is still much that i am learning...     both bleedinpurple and gts have outstanding knowledge on the CBA....
