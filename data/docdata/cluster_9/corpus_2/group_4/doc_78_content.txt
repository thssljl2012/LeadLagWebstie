Thing&amp;#039;s have come to a halt for a while at Air NZ. There are quite a number of drivers on the books with yes letters and I&amp;#039;ll try and find out exactly what you guy&amp;#039;s are looking at.    On a different note, a buddy of mine left PacBlue for Jet* about five months back and is now looking at a command on the Bus out of CHC as he;s been told that there will be a few new captains slots advertised for that base in the near future. The pay is good, about the same as Air NZ, and through their CBA they have conditions close to Qantas; an example is staff travel that is pretty sweet. . . might be worth a look while you&amp;#039;re waiting, but like I said I&amp;#039;ll ask about Air NZ.
