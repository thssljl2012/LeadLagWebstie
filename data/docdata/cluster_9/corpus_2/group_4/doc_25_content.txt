I don&amp;#039;t believe so. Just look at the NWA CBA and you will see that their duty rigs are by far superior to ours at DL. No matter if I am on duty 8 hours or 16 hours my minimum rest is 8 hours behind the door, at NW if block exeeds 8 hours they go up to 9, and if they exeed 12 they get 10 hours. That is huge, you all know how tired one can be after 15-16 hours on duty...     There are other things that are better off in the NWA CBA, now if you look at hourly pay...yes at DL its actually a little higher, but remember that NWA F/As didnt take any pay cuts until 2005...and that this contract was pretty much imposed while NWA was in Ch.11
