Is Sharpe enough?   Don&amp;#039;t piss me off more please and I call bullsh*t on needing to add Samb.   http://www.realgm.com/src_checktrade.php?tradeid=4798876   They did NOT need to add Samb. Old Man Moneybags is just being a cheap stingy f***er is all.  If that chucking bastard takes Stuckey&amp;#039;s number I am gonna be way beyond pissed.    I think you and I are the only Piston fans that hate this trade.    That&amp;#039;s allright I was pretty lonely in my assertion that Stuckey should be our draft pick when he was listed as a 2nd rounder on nbadraft and draftexpress. I was pretty lonely calling for Amir to start. I am very lonely(thanks for being with me on this) seeing Samb&amp;#039;s potential shipped away so McScrooge can add more loot to his vault.
