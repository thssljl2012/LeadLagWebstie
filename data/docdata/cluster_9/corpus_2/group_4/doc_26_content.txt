That sucks aspira, this game is too much about pve, the whole point of taking the keep at the moment is to get loot, nobody says &amp;amp;quot;lets go take a keep and kill some order&amp;amp;quot; its &amp;amp;quot;lets go take a keep so i can get a 1/20 chance to win a gold bag so i can get some stupid stat i don&amp;#039;tr need for my class cos itemization is lulz&amp;amp;quot;, Its very lame, keeps should be LOCKED after 3am (or something) and be LOCKED for 1-2 hours after capping them, I do get a very strong feeling that order avoid defending keeps directly, but as im sure its the same for order about dest, half the problem is nobody is ever &amp;amp;quot;around&amp;amp;quot; when people decide to cap a keep. There needs to be more incentive to take and defend keeps, but most times if you do show up to defend a keep it will be 3 v 30+ unless you are in proper organized big warband then you kill them and they all hide in warcamp till everything is died down and action is in next region and they come out and take keeps again        This is one of the reasons why whenever i go to bed all keeps are blue, and when i wake up all keeps are blue, keeps are only red for few hours at a time, simply because order do &amp;amp;quot;late night commando&amp;amp;quot; raids on keeps, or dest just say &amp;amp;quot;theres to many cba, keeps dont give anything anyway&amp;amp;quot;
