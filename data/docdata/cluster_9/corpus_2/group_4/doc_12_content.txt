               It&amp;#039;s designed to get them maximum money without having to move.&amp;amp;nbsp; The NBA&amp;#039;s CBA is by far the most player-friendly of all the big sports.     Good point.     I think that provided the  Pistons  do get to keep Dyess (big portion of that team&amp;#039;s success is having Dyess as a rock for 20-30 mpg at the 4) that this was one of the better moves by a franchise (the Pistons) in recent sports history. I see it potentially as a franchise saving/securing move. I think the official number is $33 million off the books next year between Sheed and AI... wow.
