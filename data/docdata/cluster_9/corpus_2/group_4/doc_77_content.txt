i&amp;#039;d say there is a pretty big difference that gets overlooked between CBA and FCRH or FCLC. That has to do with the amount of classes. Forget the kind of work you have to do in the classes for a moment. In CBA you HAVE to take 5 classes every semester if you want to graduate on time. They will accept no less. The only way to get out of that of course is by coming in with college credits/ap credits/ etc. As far as I know, in FCRH for at least half the time you&amp;#039;re here, you will be taking 4 classes per semester. That&amp;#039;s a big difference. And it has to do with the credit hours mostly. Classes in CBA are generally 3 credits while liberal arts are 4. So if you want to compare course work, you&amp;#039;ll probably have MORE work to do in CBA than in FCRH/LC. However that doesn&amp;#039;t mean it&amp;#039;s necessarily HARDER work. For example, I&amp;#039;m taking six classes right now in CBA. I can do this for 2 reasons, aside from getting permission: 1) some professors are jokes, and 2) certain classes you simply don&amp;#039;t need to do much in to get a good grade. I&amp;#039;m surprised that CBA ranks so highly to be honest. I think most of the professors and classes are jokes, at least for the business core classes. Some are pretty academically stimulating, and get you to have interesting topics, but they are far and few in between I&amp;#039;d say. I wonder sometimes, whether that means that the professors/classes in FCRH/LC are of lower quality, because that would be even worse.     Also if nocousin is talking about the residential college in O&amp;#039;Hare in regards to sophomores being in upper-classman dorms, this is not true. At Fordham, there are no dorms that are designated &amp;#039;upper-classman&amp;#039;, only ones that are designated freshman. O&amp;#039;Hare has a bunch of sophomores in it, at least more than juniors and seniors. This has to do with the fact that most juniors/seniors are in Walsh hall or off-campus.     Another thing, if you want to make some money after graduating, assuming you don&amp;#039;t want to stay in academia, then you&amp;#039;ll find that a lot of the job fairs here cater towards CBA students (specifically accounting and finance). It drives me nuts. But that&amp;#039;s the driving force in CBA, account/finance. That&amp;#039;s another thing to take into account. That&amp;#039;s not to say you can&amp;#039;t studying something in the liberal arts and not get a job in one of those industries, but you&amp;#039;ll have a much tougher time I&amp;#039;d say.
