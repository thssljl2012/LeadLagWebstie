 Well, here&amp;#039;s an update....I just got a call from Nationwide (the insurance company the guy said he had coverage though).  Apparently, he signed up with them yesterday - about an hour AFTER the accident.  What a moron.  Did he really think they wouldn&amp;#039;t find out?!  So, I guess it&amp;#039;s all going to be on my insurance.  Grrrrr.  I could kick that jerk. _________________ -Joy        &amp;amp;quot;Noncooks think it&amp;#039;s silly to invest two hours&amp;#039; work in two minutes&amp;#039; enjoyment; but if cooking is evanescent, so is the ballet.&amp;amp;quot;- Julia Child      http://bakespace.com/?joybowes
