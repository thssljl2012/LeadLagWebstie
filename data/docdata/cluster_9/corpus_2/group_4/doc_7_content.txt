Wally what would you like to know?? Everything i&amp;#039;ve ever written in uni is in one of those small A5 like 5c 128 pg exercise notebooks. Haha shows you how much work i&amp;#039;ve done over 2 years. Whats worse is that i originally had it from years ago and at least half the pages were ripped out before i started using it.       I&amp;#039;ve just opened the first page of my book, and its got the Widin v ANZ Bank case and White v Neaylon and the definitions of offer, ItT and tenders with case examples haha.
