           Has any one seen the new advert on the channel 4 network from Barclays bank? It&amp;#039;s advertising the RFID chip. I&amp;#039;ve seen it three times in two days, and I don&amp;#039;t watch much TV. Any one else seen it or similar.       Don&amp;#039;t take the chip. Don&amp;#039;t take the mark of the devil.
