I have been on mono creatine for 3 days now and drink about 5pints of water a day   i cba to do loading phase so i just take 2 servings a day once in the morning and once after training      but i pee all the time like every hour is that normal?      &amp;amp;amp;        i am also on the cut   i no about water weight but does this affect the whole body because it looks like the water is just sitting on my gut   and before my fat was quite hard now it is like jelly    is that also normal?      cheers
