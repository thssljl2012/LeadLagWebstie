I cba to go look at what your nickname was. XD Just tell me and I&amp;#039;ll correct it.)  Well, I don&amp;#039;t sketch traditionally. XD I should do, but I&amp;#039;m really picky about the paper. I have NO idea what the paper I really like to sketch on is called, so I&amp;#039;ve only had it once in my whole life.    crying    But... I sketch my whole drawing out in detail before I ink it. XD I wish I could just do a blob~~!    @Rusty~  Thanks! *feels like people are going to think he was trying to get attention* =_=  But really, I could point out a lot of things. If I&amp;#039;d be asked to help someone, unless they were REALLY bad themselves, I&amp;#039;d like... be scared. XD *not lying when I said &amp;amp;quot;guess&amp;amp;quot; work* I just sketch, erase, sketch, erase... until it looks decent. x_X                                                        &amp;amp;nbsp;                                  &amp;amp;nbsp;                                  &amp;amp;nbsp;                                       &amp;amp;nbsp;                         &amp;amp;nbsp;        &amp;amp;nbsp;        &amp;amp;nbsp;                     &amp;amp;nbsp;
