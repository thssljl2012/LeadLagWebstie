Goodell is probably posturing for when the CBA is renegotiated. The NFLPA will undoubtedly want an arbitrator for fines and such. If Goodell can prove that he is in fact a &amp;#039;fair&amp;#039; (at least for now) mediator, the NFLPA will have less grounds to demand an unbiased arbitrator.      It just so happens he probably thinks &amp;amp;quot;well, if I HAVE to overturn a fine, it&amp;#039;ll be for an NY team&amp;amp;quot;
