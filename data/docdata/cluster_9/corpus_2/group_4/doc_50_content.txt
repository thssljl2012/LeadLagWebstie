I have to do loads of coursework on horseriding for gcse, and i need to analyse someone for their strengths and weaknesses, but i cba to watch my friend so im making it up. It&amp;amp;#039;s good, i just need one more weakness and one more strength! so far i&amp;amp;#039;ve got; seat aids, jumping seat, her heels come up, canter, schooling movements, hands. If someone could give me a few important factors and WHY they are important that would be great. :)
