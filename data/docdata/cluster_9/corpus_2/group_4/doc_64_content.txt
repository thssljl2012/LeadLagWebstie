You and I both know that the Chargers have a slim chance of going to the playoffs.      Are you banking on that slim chance or is it the killer time we had at the 49er game in San Fran a couple of years ago that spoiled us?      They may win the next 3, but we have to overcome: Miami, Patriots, Jets, Bills, Ravens, Broncos, and Steelers to have a shot. They ALL have a better record than us!!!                      i copied this dudes, post i figured it would be right       Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  31cromartie31                         What schedule are you looking at?                      i cba checking out it out for my self
