EXCELLENT NEWS.     As a Barclays customer I am thrilled, British people in Britain doing British Jobs.     When I talk to my bank I always thank the teleadvisor for being British   and ask them to pass on my comments to their manager, I wonder if lots of people do the same? I am never negative to the people from abroad but they frustrate the hell out of me as they seem not to understand my regional accent and it seems much confusion is caused in there interpretation of what I say.
