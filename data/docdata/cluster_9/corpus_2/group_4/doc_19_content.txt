                     Rfid chip commercial on e4                                             Has anyone seen the new RFID chip commercial on E4&amp;amp;gt;       I&amp;#039;ve seen it three times in the last two days on the channel 4 network. It&amp;#039;s a guy sliding down a massive water slide on the outside of the building and he gets scanned on the way down. Its by Barclays bank. Basically saying &amp;amp;quot; welcome to a cashless society&amp;amp;quot;. It&amp;#039;s all coming together for them. They  are bringing it in very slowly and in a fun cool way. Don&amp;#039;t take the mark of the devil. We will be forced to take it, but don&amp;#039;t give up your right to be a human, and have a natural body with nothing put inside it.
