YOU SAVE ALL MY POSTS. WHY CAN&amp;#039;T YOU COME UP WITH THE ONE YOU CLAIM I MADE ABOUT PEANUT BUTTER? THERE WAS NONE, SO YOU CAN&amp;#039;T.    Hey ,Splicer , speaking of peanut butter...How&amp;#039;s&amp;amp;nbsp; that double time during today ? Gee, how many paid breaks are in your CBA.            &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;   YOU&amp;#039;RE THE ONE WHO CLAIMS TO KNOW WHAT IS IN THE CBA.&amp;amp;nbsp; TELL US ALL WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT PAID BREAKS. WHY DON&amp;#039;T YOU ALSO ADDRESS CALL OUT PAY, OUT OF TOUR PAY, SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL, AND SLEEP TIME. YOU WON&amp;#039;T DO THAT BECAUSE IT WOULD NEGATE YOUR CLAIM THAT SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO WORK OVER 800 HOURS OT TO MAKE OVER 100K. YOU KNOW NOTHING. IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE CONTRACT YOU WOULD KNOW IT DOES NOT ADDRESS PAID BREAKS FOR FIELD TECHS.
