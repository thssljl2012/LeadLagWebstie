 This guy is a disaster.  He would stink it up in the CBA, agreed?  What&amp;#039;s all this talk about him becoming a dominant defender? The guy&amp;#039;s legs aren&amp;#039;t even straight, for cryoing out loud!  His body is a crippled wreck and he is unable to stay on the floor... at age 20! Get a clue, folks.    he seemed to play OK tonight
