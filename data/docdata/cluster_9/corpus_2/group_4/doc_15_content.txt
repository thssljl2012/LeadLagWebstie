    quote  Andy_Jay1987    Aye, and who the hell would want to go to Newcastle on a cold night in november, in fact scratch the weather and month.  Me!    Nahh I get the point about it being a Monday night miles from home &amp;amp; all. Cold etc. But when Ive finished being a student bum &amp;amp; got a job Im planning on following Liverpool as much as possible. Easier said than done of course..
