Mark and others,   Are you so sure that Pitt will play?  Think about it ... the league and other teams are footing their bills as we speak.  Why would the CBA not welcome with open arms a replacement from another league that can pay it&amp;#039;s own way from the word go?  I would venture to say that they may even waive some franchise fees to get a viable franchise to take Pitt&amp;#039;s place and stop some of the bleeding.  A team on life support v. a viable franchise that can support itself (or with an owner that can handle a loss) ... which would you choose?  Sorry PSBF, I mean no disrespect, I just miss the CBA of old.  And there was no merger because the PBL had nothing to gain in the deal.
