Truly a poor choice from the NFLPA and something that will hurt the game dearly, but let them go out there and play football. It&amp;#039;s a contact sport what do you expect!?                      I don&amp;#039;t really see where this is the NFLPA&amp;#039;s fault. If a player wants to appeal their fine, the NFLPA does so. Unfortunatly, the appeal goes right back to Roger Goodell. When the bargaining for a new CBA begins, the NFLPA needs to fight for all apeals to be held in front of an unbiased arbitrator and not the head of the league that issued the fine.
