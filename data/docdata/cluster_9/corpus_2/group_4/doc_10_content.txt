This should determine wether or not they tag Cassel.                      Right now they&amp;#039;re $24.5M under the cap, Cassel would eat all but about $10M of that.  That&amp;#039;s with 38 players signed so it would leave them with little maneuverability.  It would make it difficult to resign players early but with the CBA up after next year I&amp;#039;m not sure there would be much of that anyway.
