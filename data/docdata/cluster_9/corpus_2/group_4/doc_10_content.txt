     got this posted by a guy in a UK newspaper forum, thinks its quite funny             Quote:                          Just read that our revered benefactor, Sheikh Mansoor, has pumped 3.5 billion into Barclays Bank as part of their prop-up plan. This will give him a 16% stake in the company.       One might therefore reason that since Barclays sponsor the Premier League then City are technically and indirectly funding it. Furthermore, by definition a good percentage of the prize money being paid out to all Clubs will also be technically and indirectly coming from City !       Priceless.
