 As I said, Howard struggled early in 2005 and was sent back to the minors. And because of that, other teams tried again to see if the Phillies would give up on him and trade him. Just because you can&amp;#039;t remember or are confused again or just don&amp;#039;t know again does not mean that it didn&amp;#039;t happen.   Just like how you couldn&amp;#039;t remember or just didn&amp;#039;t knowabout Hampton&amp;#039;s contract, so you just blindly believed something you saw on a website.  Just like how you didn&amp;#039;t know about the MLB rule preventing on-field performance bonuses when you posted that Markakis (and players like him) should earn their pay through contract bonuses based onwhat they do on the field. I&amp;#039;ve brought that thread up several times...where you only know about the vague descriptions of performance bonuses in the CBA, but knew nothing about the specific MLB rule preventing those performance bonuses being for on-field performance.  Just like how you didn&amp;#039;t know that the Orioles did not convert Esteban Yan to a pitcher. I knew that it was when Yan was in the Expos organization that he was converted from catcher to pitcher. I also knew that you were confusing Yan with a player who the Orioles did convert from catcher to pitcher...Nerio Rodriguez.  Just like when you didn&amp;#039;t know anything about the players&amp;#039; contracts, so you blindly believed something you (think you)heard on the radio that Hayden Penn and John Maine had the samecontact as Adam Loewen and would have to be on the Orioles 25 man roster too.  And just like when you posted that the Phillies and Orioles could not work out a trade forPat Burrell because the Phillieswanted 2 top prospects forBurrell...I had to provide the correct information that the Phillies and Orioles had agreed on a trade of Rodriguez Lopez and Brandon Fahey for Burrell, but Burrell vetoed the deal. Either you once again did not know about the agreed upon trade, or you thought that Lopez and Fahey were 2 top prospects.  The title of this thread is &amp;quot;What if?&amp;quot;...as in what if you ever got something right. Instead you just make it so easy for everyone to see how little you know.
