First of all RTD always said it would have to be a young actor to be able to handle the intense production schedule, so that takes a lot of these suggestions out.      I&amp;#039;ve thought of someone I&amp;#039;d like to have considered for the role, the ginger actor fwho played Mac in Green Wing, and then went onto the Barclays adverts and did a turn in Merlin the other week that reminded me of Tom Baker.
