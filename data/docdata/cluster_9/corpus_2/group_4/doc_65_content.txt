I have antique plates in PA. You&amp;#039;re allowed to drive your antique in PA &amp;amp;quot;once a week&amp;amp;quot; (as if any police officer would know) to keep it in tune, but not to &amp;amp;quot;work&amp;amp;quot;. I&amp;#039;ve heard that some states, like NJ, are more strict about the usage of their &amp;amp;quot;Historic&amp;amp;quot; plates, and see them as a reason to pull you over if it&amp;#039;s not the weekend. Thankfully, I don&amp;#039;t live in a state like that!      Back on the subject of insurance, however. If you can abide by the 2500 miles per year and other restrictions on use, you can save yourself a bundle on your antique or collector car insurance. Most of the larger players (JC Taylor, Grundy, etc...) don&amp;#039;t require you to have an antique plate on your car to get their collector car policy. They do require, however, your car to be considered &amp;amp;quot;collectible&amp;amp;quot;. They accepted an 11 year old Fiat convertible without question, but wouldn&amp;#039;t accept a 21 year old Ford sedan. Had that Ford been a Lincoln, it would have been accepted without question.       Craig
