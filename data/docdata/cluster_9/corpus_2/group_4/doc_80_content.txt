It&amp;#039;s not beyond the realm of possibility if the owners are really willing  to pay the actual cost of that kind of offer, which to be truly net would go above $60 million/year.         Endorsement-wise, he might actually see an increase. It&amp;#039;s not like Kobe would suddenly vanish from the minds of folks in the US, so Nike would still do quite well over here while having the biggest name in basketball in Europe. Then you add in the high end corporate endorsements that he could get in Europe that simply are not  available to NBA players, like Rolex, BMW, Mercedes, etc.        And then there&amp;#039;s the impact a move like this would have on the NBA. Childress has done well so far, so that has gotten some attention, but if a superstar makes the move and the feedback is positive, that will most likely have a serious impact on the next CBA in 2010. Stern and the owners aren&amp;#039;t sweating losing some role players to Europe because there are always others to step in and fill the void, but if it becomes a viable option for the real cash cows? That&amp;#039;s a whole new ballgame. The numbers being mentioned for Kobe from the Lakers when he opts out aren&amp;#039;t random, it&amp;#039;s the most any NBA team can offer under the current CBA. If teams have to start worrying about serious competition from teams outside of the NBA that don&amp;#039;t have the same restrictions, that&amp;#039;s when the talks stop being something that can be dismissed with a laugh.         As for anyone saying that if Kobe did leave, it&amp;#039;s no sweat because the Lakers could just go after Lebron, forget it. Even with him off the books, they don&amp;#039;t have the money to be players in that game, and if another billionaire owned Euro team sees Olympiakos having enough success with Kobe in year 1 and decides to make a run of their own at a superstar, they REALLY don&amp;#039;t have the money to hang.         I still doubt that he would go, but I doubt the decision would be as easy as some might think, same as it would be for any player now or at any time if the disparity of numbers were the same. _________________
