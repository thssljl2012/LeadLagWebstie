 Green&amp;#039;s numbers are a bit better so far, but mediocre swingmen are the easiest players to find in the NBA. There are a hundred CBA players who are athletic and can score, and yet still suck. But people fall in love with them b/c they have a nice string of highlights for a few games. Flip Murray, anyone?      The truly rare qualities in swingmen are the unheralded ones: passing, handles, spacing, defense, rebounding, and general BB IQ. I haven&amp;#039;t seen Green play live, so I&amp;#039;ll withhold judgment. But has he shown progress in any of those areas?
