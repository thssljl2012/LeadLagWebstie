          Raw was great imo, too bad they screwed up a certain someones return. XD  Also the car at the beginning, i thought it was going to be Cena!  Shane was pretty out of order with what he said. XD    Anywho yeah was good wont go into detail. (it might get deleted again  )  Nah only joking but cba and mark your calendars, in 2 weeks will be another 3 hour Raw!  Also at Armageddon (will put it in invisible just in case none of you know yet)  it will be Chris Jericho vs John Cena for the World Heavyweight Championship.     I then think it will be Batista vs Randy Orton which should have happened at Survivor Series.          &amp;amp;nbsp;               Oh and Footiegamer, complete MGS3!   &amp;amp;quot;United We Stand, Divided We Fall&amp;amp;quot;
