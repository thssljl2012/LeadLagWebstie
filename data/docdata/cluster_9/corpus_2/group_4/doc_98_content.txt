Going off-topic for a second, I had my TV tuned to the NASCAR race a while ago (on ABC), and they showed a commercial for Nationwide Insurance featuring Kevin Harvick in Corvette doing donuts in a residential cul-de-sac while a family stood at the curb watching.  To me, that is just unbelievably stupid and irresponsible.  AN INSURANCE COMPANY!  Glamorizing idiotic behavior!  What were they thinking???
