Does a CIC trip plus up you computed BLG for the month or is it considered makeup (i.e. makeup pay status)?  For example.  If for some reason you drop a CIC trip, are you in the hole for the month on your BLG or is it like dropping a M/U trip?    Thanks                      1.  This question will be answered on Wed when you go into Monthly makeup Bid.  It will tell you how many hours you are eligible to makeup.  The total will be 6 hrs greater than your dropped trips.    2.  You will be in the hole on BLG if you do not makeup what you lost.  More specifically, you need to get a monthly makeup bid award at least equal to your dropped trip(s) to keep your pay up.
