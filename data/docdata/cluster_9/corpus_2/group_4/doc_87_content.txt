ARE THEY IDIOTS? Server transfers aren&amp;#039;t done to all servers at once for Warp&amp;#039;s sake. How the hell do you imagine even 20 servers having transfers at once to be organized?    Transfers are done in turns NA servers had what? 6, 7 turns of transfer.They also aren&amp;#039;t announced all at once but when time for specific batch of servers comes.

All problems for so many servers and people would be solved with a merge... even if destro became more, order would become more, enabling order to muster defenses and offenses much more easily... and we would be like heroes against the hosts of evil! *heroic pose, eyes shining, rightoeus laugh*                      Well I don&amp;#039;t know about you but I gain way more renown by defending a keep (and failing) than taking an empty one and a lot more than in scenarios.    &amp;amp;quot;Cooldown&amp;amp;quot; on scenarios is more like &amp;amp;quot;SP can&amp;#039;t be played more than 8 times in an hour&amp;amp;quot; (just a guess about the number) so if only 1 SP is played at a time in this hour it won&amp;#039;t reach the cooldown.    And relax transfers will come. If not to Dron than off Dron.    Also I kinda agree with you on your last point that even if there was more destro but high pop on both sides it would be much better than equal but low on both (tho I would preffer high on both).
