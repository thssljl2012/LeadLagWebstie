Therefore, we would be paying a higher cap figure for them, than if we had resigned them long term. Im assuming that most contracts are heavier in the last 2 yrs, including rookie deals.                      It is possible but I will contend that over the past couple of years teams have been acting like there is no cap (see Dallas, Oakland) and that teams will have a ton of cap space in 2009 so they will probably attempt to use it. A player who signs a one-year deal in 2009 in the hope of getting a bigger deal in 2010 is risking    1.) his not getting injured in 2009   2.) his level of play staying the same   3.) that the CBA is not extended before 2010.      Is that risk-reward ratio favorable??
