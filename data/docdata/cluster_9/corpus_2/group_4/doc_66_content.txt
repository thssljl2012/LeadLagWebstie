      Only if you&amp;#039;re castless &amp;amp;#8211; tattooed Lunars can&amp;#039;t use that spell                  Lunars don&amp;#039;t get essence lenses as they don&amp;#039;t make weapons of essence in the way Solars, Abyssals and Terrestrials do.        What they would have instead is effects similar to those already mentioned that are available as an addon to Moonsilver CBA. From that you can extend other similar artifacts out. But they won&amp;#039;t be essence lenses. _________________ Saying &amp;quot;This must be the way it is&amp;quot; is likely to make me question your point and show its weaknesses. This doesn&amp;#039;t mean I actually agree with you.        #exalted IRC channel on irc.wetfish.net     It&amp;#039;s interesting.        Site for my  charms coming soon
