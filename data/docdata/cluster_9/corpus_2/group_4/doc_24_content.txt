I think everyone gets around the table and works out a CBA extention long beofore anything like this becomes unmanagable .       Those hoping for an end to the cap are going to be disapointed .       Uncompetitive football is not going to bring in those huge TV $$$$, and banks are going to be more reluctant to lend to the NFL as a whole  . I do think there is going to be a greater redistribution to the smaller teams, and for once they may have some of the big five over a barrell.
