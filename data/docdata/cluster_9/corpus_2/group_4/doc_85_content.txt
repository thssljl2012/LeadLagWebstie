Ya Kizz, I agree that it is probably not going to happen. But can you see the sense in it? I mean let&amp;#039;s say we did manage to find a CB in the draft that started out 2nd or 3rd round but then blew up to something way better. How long would that take? Would it take long enough for the CBA to be rebuilt so salaries could get under control, or would the guy kick a55 just in time for contract renegotiation in the 2010 offseason sans CBA? Could we end up paying even more on a contract redux then?  I admit, the idea of another draft with a bunch more players and the inevitable endless depth it would represent is extremely attractive. So is the concept of being able to easily re-sign Bell and Carey (I think we could find replacing Crowder easier than it may seem). But Asomugha is the type of talent that comes around once every decade - perhaps more, and he is a baby. He&amp;#039;s worth the money - every dime.  If he&amp;#039;s franchised mind you, Wilson cannot be. Although I can&amp;#039;t see working as hard or paying as much as with Aso, it&amp;#039;s something to think about. Might we take advantage of the last year of the CBA to lock the secondary up?
