                                                                   The leauge locked out the players 3 years ago in order to fix the game and make it healthier. Perhaps the PA should opt-out of the current CBA for the same reason. Make the leauge healthier by making the additon of 1 or 2 more Canadian teams something the PA demands....and do not play another game  of NHL hockey until Hamilton and Winniprg have teams.    Its a long shot, but probably the best leverage the P.A. would have in righting this historic wrong.
