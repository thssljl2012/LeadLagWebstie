Hey everyone!!   Yes its me.... i wouldnt hold it against you if you didnt remember who i was?!   Sorry... work and kids leaves not much time for message boards. However, i am on Facebook daily, so if anyone would like to be my friend, pls PM me your email address and i will try and find you.      ooh i made it here in time for the Melb cup! So going to miss the excitement. Very jealous of hubby who is going to Oaks day for &amp;amp;quot;work&amp;amp;quot;. Yeah right!      Well where can i start?... first of all huge congrats to all the mums UTD. Sorry if you are almost having your baby by now! OMG Kylie another set of twins! and Duedrop no#10!!! You guys are really brave. As for me, i am selling all my baby stuff and the proceeds are going to charity. So i guess i have pretty much decided there will be no more. I am really loving where i am at life right now and feel really happy with my two. I have just landed a new job with ANZ bank (asia) on an awesome project. I could not be happier cause that was the only thing i was not liking abt being here. We were really tossing up heading back to Oz b/c i didnt like my work much. I liked working but the job wasnt that great. So now everything has fallen into place and I am no longer going out of my mind trying to decide where to live next yr. YEAY!      Dilan is going great guns!! I actually think he is speaking at a 2 yr old level. I am just so loving this age right now, ijust want to bottle him up and keep him this cute forever! Today he said to me &amp;amp;quot;Mummy watch this!&amp;amp;quot; and tried to do a somersault! LOL. He is such a boy. Loves his cars and balls. I just started him on half days at Montessori b/c i felt he was bored out of his brain at home with my nanny and he is loving it! The little bugger had hardly any separation anxiety. I am really glad he is happy.      Our live in Nanny is leaving us in Dec and so I am getting a new one. It will be interesting to see how he takes to her. My current one has been with him since birth. I definitely think its time for her to go though, i found out recently that she was using our internet a lot more than she has been given permission for. She&amp;#039;s been on internet dating sites chatting up guys. When she is supposed to be looking after my child! So now we have put a password on our PCs. I am sure she didnt neglect him but its still not right. I cant surf the net all day at work!      Recently had my 80 yr old grandparents visiting for a few days and that was interesting to say the least. DH was OS so i was taking them and the kids around. It was exhausting.      Well i would love to write to you all individually but that would take me bloody ages. Hope you all enjoy your cup day. oh and i will be checking back to see if i won the bet!      MummyT - Great news about M&amp;amp;amp;D walking!      Linds - Glad all is well with Scarlett and Cooper.
