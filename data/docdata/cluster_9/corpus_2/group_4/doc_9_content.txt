         King McKong    post  8623:-  Who would you rather be mugged by in a dark alley? - a sheikh with an oil well, or a man from Scotland with muddled intentions?   An Arab and a  Scotsman mugged a Geordie for two hours, before they finally overcame him and took 5 from his pockets.  &amp;amp;quot;Thank God&amp;amp;quot; said the Scotsman that he did not have 20, or he would have killed both of us&amp;amp;quot;.
