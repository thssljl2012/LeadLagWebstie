Adamsfield is now not even a ghost town. Not a single dwelling remains of what in 1925 was the beginning of a township of some 1000 people, despite its location in a quiet valley in Tasmania&amp;#039;s remote south-west.      Prospectors and miners rushed to the area after osmiridium was discovered, an alloy primarily used in the manufacture of fountain pen nibs with a value at that time, ten times that of gold. Later, it was also used in dentistry and in electronics       I trekked into the area two years ago during December, 2006 when I shot this photo essay of all that was left of Adamsfield.  Last year an all consuming bushfire consigned all that remained to history.          The &amp;amp;quot;Clarke huts&amp;amp;quot; reflect the past.          A water pump and sluice.       The good ole Aussie &amp;amp;quot;barbie&amp;amp;quot;, otherwise known as an outdoor grill!  lol           &amp;amp;quot;That marked its place, and in the sky the birds still bravely singing fly!&amp;amp;quot;  (erroneously misquoted!)

Nevertheless, the ANZ today stands firm with all other Australian banks in the face of the current economic crisis!
