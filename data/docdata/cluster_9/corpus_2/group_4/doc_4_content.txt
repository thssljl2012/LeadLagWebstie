The shape is amazing, as that is close to exactly what a Sea Horse should look like, and I like all the different views you have done of it. One of the only slightly worse things I can see is the eye, it seems a bit dodgy and not as &amp;#039;round&amp;#039; as they should be.     But yeah, overall it&amp;#039;s pretty much pefect. 91%.       I always loved your alts though Rix. But where did your rollercoaster get to (Kingda Ka)?                      Thanks    Oh god we are going back far with that one, i lost it when i got my laptop, it&amp;#039;s still on my pc but i cba to put it on my laptop
