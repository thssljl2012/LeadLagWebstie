 Part 6                              Above we see an old ANZ Bank, (formerly Union Bank of Australia), 351 Collins Street,  built in 1878; the architects were Smith and Johnson of Melbourne, in association with Macvicar Anderson of London.  The top storey was increased in 1905, filling in between side rooms which had stood like pavilion towers as can be seen below.  It was demolished in 1966.  The two statues by R. Jackson,  Britannia  and  Goddess  were moved to ground floor corridor of the  Architecture, Building &amp;amp;amp; Planning  building at Melbourne University.              Collins Street about 60 years ago.
