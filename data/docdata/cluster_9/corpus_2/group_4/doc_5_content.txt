Tierre Brown, Smush Parker and Russell Robinson iare NBA caliber 1&amp;#039;s.   Rob McKiver and Gary Forbes are the Top 2.   Erik Daniels, James White and Derrick Byers are the top 3&amp;#039;s.   James Mays is the top 4   and Richards is the best Center.      I&amp;#039;m interested in seeing how Eddie Ard, KJ Garland and Keoni Watson make out vs. top notch talent.      Kieth Brumbaugh is the prototype minor league player, here is a guy that has loads of talent but has never been coached. He&amp;#039;ll also need to gain a little weight because those 6&amp;#039;8 190 dudes never seem to pan out.      Same goes for John Gilchrist, dude was all-ACC as a jr. but a bad tude sidetracked his career, I hope he gets his act together.      Jasper Johnson was a D-2 Beast at Delta State, and their are not a lot of beefy players that can pound inside with him on the draft list.      Taj McCollough was the final cut by the Washington Wizards this fall.      Alpha Bangara is one of the all-time greatest former Mayhem players (For all you old-CBA guys).      Ashanti Cook, Gary Ervin and Vernon Hamilton are all good PG&amp;#039;s that could go in Rounds 2-3.      I&amp;#039;d look for bigs (there are not many out there this year) to go in a hurry so Jermareo Davidson, Mohammed Abukar, Coleman Collins, Mays, Daniels and Richards should go in the 1st round. Along with former NBA players like Brown, Parker, White and David Noel. Solid vets like Byars, Hamilton and Larry Ayuso sound round out the 1st round along with the cream of the crop rookies: Russell, Brumbaugh and McCollough and Forbes.(If CJ Giles had declared he would go no.1)
