           Aerobics this morning was great, the physio from the hospital took us and really made us move..A few of the oldies had trouble keeping up but enjoyed it non the less..      My sister was taking the floor stretches and kept saying &amp;amp;quot;change legs&amp;amp;quot; I piped up &amp;amp;quot;If I could change legs do you think I would have these little short fat ones?&amp;amp;quot; everyone laughed and put us all off our routine for a bit..Laughter is the best medicine anyway!!!!      They weren&amp;#039;t laughing to much in the ANZ bank, over the weekend some idiot had got the fire house from further on in the arcade, put it at the bank door where there is a gap and turned it on..They sucked 160litres of water from the carpet and it is still soaked..Who would do that!!!
