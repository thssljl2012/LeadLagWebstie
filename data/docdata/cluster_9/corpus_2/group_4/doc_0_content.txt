   quote   spikerdude       quote   spikerdude         I know we normally can&amp;#039;t have game threads, but could I post a 20 questions thread?            cough cough        20 questions as in the game where you think of a word, and people get 20 questions to help them guess the word?  I&amp;#039;m not sure that would work considering people would end up posting the same question more than once because they aren&amp;#039;t paying attention and cba to read all the previous pages, I could definitely see people asking crap questions to be funny ((ex. Can it ride an elephant during the nighttime?)), and it would just go way too fast for the person actually asking the question to get any answers in. I can ask Shane about it and I&amp;#039;ll leave the topic open for other people in here to discuss, those are just my thoughts on it.    quote   Alvaroduck       quote   Quierta       quote   Alvaroduck     What&amp;#039;s the policy on posts like  this ? They don&amp;#039;t really add much to the thread.   To be honest I see nothing wrong with it D: The user asked a question in the first post and that answer is completely legitimate. It&amp;#039;s asking if you&amp;#039;ve ever had an &amp;quot;I&amp;#039;m so going to hell&amp;quot; experience, and the user said no and then said why.   But his post deviated from the purpose of the thread. It was not a religious thread,  it was notasking what you believed in... it was more of a &amp;quot;what have you done that you&amp;#039;ve regretted&amp;quot; thread.  It&amp;#039;s kind of like me going into a thread loosely related to clothing and saying &amp;quot;I&amp;#039;m wearing red socks&amp;quot;.   Not really... the question was &amp;quot;Have you ever been something that made you think that?&amp;quot; which is a yes or a no question. The person said no and said why - it&amp;#039;s not like they were just throwing in their random opinion that didn&amp;#039;t fit the question at all.    quote   llll     is the header going to be updated to fit the themes any time soon?     Problem with that, see  : (  The Answer needs to change our thread for us to fit the forum header. If we make the colors match, he&amp;#039;d have to make 10 themes  every single time we change the header . The problem is trying to figure out how to do that without any 3 of us going mad.    quote   llll       quote   KeatonKeaton999       quote   limberheadpollen      Do you even know your way around this forum?        LOL its liquid halo   not sure if this guy is bypassing, and it&amp;#039;s none of my business, but I thought you would want to know its the same spammer.   No, he&amp;#039;s bypassing. NN.
