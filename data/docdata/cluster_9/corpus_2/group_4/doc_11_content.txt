McHale is worse because he has made two nice moves (drafting KG, trading for Cassell) in more than a decade on the job. Isiah never made moves as good as those as the Knicks GM, but he didn&amp;#039;t have as long on the job. Also, Isiah didn&amp;#039;t trade away Brandon Roy for Randy Foye or Ray Allen for Stephon Marbury. Or lose 3 picks signing Joe Smith (of all people) to an illegal, under the table contract.  Overall though, I think Isiah is the bigger idiot because he also has the destruction of the CBA on his resume. So he not only robbed a franchise of hope, he robbed a whole league of hope.  If forced to choose one of them as my GM at gunpoint, I might choose the gun   .
