Well in my mind they can **** off. I am not having some 40 year old peado who works with children for a living saying what I can and can&amp;#039;t have. I pay for it out of my own money, it&amp;#039;s my choice. If that&amp;#039;s the way they wanna play I&amp;#039;ll tell every Habbo user not to pay for HC as it&amp;#039;s VIP and it&amp;#039;s not allowed. Anyway, I thought HxF wasn&amp;#039;t support by Sulake, only Hx? I cba with Habbo controlling the forum when most people don&amp;#039;t even use the forum for Habbo.    Forum VIP is the same as that ****** HC them ***** have.     Do as I say, not as I do. Knoblocks.
