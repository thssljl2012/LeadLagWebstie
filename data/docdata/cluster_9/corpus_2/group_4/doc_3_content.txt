Well they should know what &amp;amp;quot;4&amp;amp;quot; is as:      - That&amp;#039;s how many flags they&amp;#039;ve won in 80 odd years.    - That&amp;#039;s the amount in their bank account.   - That&amp;#039;s their average attendance at ANZ Stadium.   - That&amp;#039;s the average possessions per game Daniel Wells gets.   - That&amp;#039;s the amount of Bundy and Cokes Shannon Grant needs to drink before he upturns a port-a-loo
