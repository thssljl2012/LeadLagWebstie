I know there would be certain cap hits here and there. However, we will likely have to fund a top 5 pick anyway, and the 2nd round and below will not require scary contracts, so the question is how do we fund the second 1 st round pick? I was banking on:      1. Asomugha will no longer be there, that is one whole franchise of a salary that will not need to be paid.   2. I am looking to trade or cut some of the higher (although maybe not the highest) earners: Michael Huff,   Justin Fargas  , Justin Griffith,   Derrick Burgess  , Cooper Carlisle, John Wade, Cornell Green, Kwame Harris, Ashley Lelie,   Ronald Curry   &amp;amp;amp;   Gerard Warren  . There are some reasonable sized contracts in there and although some are on vet minimum, they will be higher than some rookie minimum contracts.   3. Negotiate a pay cut with   Javon Walker   - I know everyone will say yeah right, but this guy was willing to give it all up just a couple of months back (which would have meant no money), and I am sure he will see the benefit to him of better protection for the QB in improving his stats - well its worth a try.   4. Restructure a lot of contracts, so that money is paid in the no-CBA year (we should know by then what is happening with this).
