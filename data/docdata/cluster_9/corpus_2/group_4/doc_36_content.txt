a very interesting read      Probably missed some stuff, here is a recap.      MLS will look at  Scheduling conflicts   Expansion candidates   Who plays in which tournaments (SuperLiga, US Cup, Champions League)      Some Topics that came up  League, Fans, Media Relations, Infrastructure and so on is growing faster than expected.    MLS would like to add 2 more teams sometime after 2011 (20 Teams), no timetable.    European Schedule not possible, MLS would fold.    Playoffs wont go away, tweaks possible (format, where the MLS cup is held)    No major Roster/Salarycap changes for 2009 (last year of CBA)    MLS not really happy about the Champions League being &amp;amp;quot;created&amp;amp;quot;. (no control or income)    NYC Team wont come quickly    Donovan (MLS want more than 10M$ or he stays)    Some Stadium and Expansion Fee rumblings
