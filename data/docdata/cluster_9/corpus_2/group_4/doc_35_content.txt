                             Okay, I do know what it is, or have an understanding of what it is rather but I&amp;#039;m referring to something totally different.     jesus, kyle said maybe the staff are just leaving the groups or w.e (cba to check)  and i said yeah, &amp;#039;cause banned staff can do that. as I thought he was referring to staff being able to do that, yes some could but not all can.. (without use of MySQL)     also; Lovetostack don&amp;#039;t insult my intelligence when you do not know me, yes I do not know everything about all this bull but yeah. gr.     PS. read the bits in BOLD CAPITALS .. make that clear enough for you?          Quote:                         okay, now you&amp;#039;re beginning to wind me up read what kyle said clearly &amp;amp;quot;its called staff leaving the groups&amp;amp;quot; THE STAFF LEAVING, themselves, on there accounts like say someone adds Callie to a group there&amp;#039;s no way for her to leave on her own,  WITHOUT HABBO DOING WHAT YOU&amp;#039;VE SUGGESTED ABOVE!  He implied they were but then I said how some are banned staff and there&amp;#039;s no way they could just leave the groups like he suggested. god, i&amp;#039;m leaving this now as it&amp;#039;s not exactly a big deal - READ next time                     also brodeo, thanks for the rep glad some people know what i mean
