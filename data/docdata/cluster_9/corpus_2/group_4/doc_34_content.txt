 bill fitch.      fitch, imo, is a forgotten legend.       1. an interchanging post ofense with ralph and akeem where both got their shots.      2.  perfect assimilation of lukie as point guard (half court alleys 2 dream/ralph but hit ur spotups and run with lew)      3.  a DEADLY fast break, either solo (lew lloyd) or as a team (lucas, wiggie, reid &amp;amp;amp; ralph/dream trailing)      4.  excellent transitions between 3 pgs with differing games.  lukie was a pure point with the best alleyoops in the game.  a floor general!  allen leavell, broke wrist and all, was more gritty, safer, and prone to pullups.  as a cba&amp;#039;er, fitch assimilated leavell fantastically.  then bobby joe reid played pg, too, though he was a natural 2 guard without pg handles.        all this talent and we never had offensive quarrels.  never shot distribution questions.  we had a fricken machine!!!!  ralph was allowed to be a damn 7&amp;#039;4&amp;quot; point!  unheard of before fitch!!      people sleep on fitch.  I don&amp;#039;t.  one hell of a coach.
