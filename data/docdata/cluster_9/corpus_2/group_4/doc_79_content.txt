                   http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/basketball/nba/10/31/Marbury.IR.ap/index.html      Well ignored league wide.     or....you simply don&amp;#039;t understand the rule change. I&amp;#039;m going with that explanation more than yours.  The post on the nba site specifically mentions the example of injured players needing less than the 5 day minimum Neither the cba or the inactive list states anything about using it as a bargaining chip in a buyout which is the unions issue.
