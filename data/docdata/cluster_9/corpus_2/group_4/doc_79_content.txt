Also,   http://www.apfa.org/images/contract/...comparison.pdf      Its from 2006, but thats the actual latest document without me giving you the links to the individual airline CBA and you going thru them. Hope it answers your question.                      I know I am putting myself in the crosshairs for saying this ... but,     Chart 27 IS NOT necessarily a reflection of FA wages. It is FA wage cost PER unit mile. There could be many reasons why DAL and NWA end up on the bottom besides pay. It could be that NWA or DAL staffs each airplane with one less FA. Or perhaps the DAL FAs are younger, which would drive lower labor costs than say an airline with older FAs.     But I see your point. When compared to AA, DAL FAs wages are about 10 percent lower. Considering DAL just exited bankruptcy, this isn&amp;#039;t exactly a bad thing! The chart is also from 2006. Didn&amp;#039;t DAL FAs get an increase in pay with the merger DCC?      I guess a point I&amp;#039;d like to make sure ya&amp;#039;ll know who you get in bed with. I read a NWA FA message that was sent out by their union about how DAL management had sent a questionaire to all FAs. And the union had painted that as such a bad thing. The unions are always trying to tell us that management is bad. I&amp;#039;m sure some are, and I know some have been in the past.      I just don&amp;#039;t want to see our happy FAs become a bitter group because some union smuck is telling them that management sucks and that they deserve better.      -Fatty
