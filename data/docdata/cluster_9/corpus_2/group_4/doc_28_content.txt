      europe/northrend  ggc/garena or bnet.  i dont need noobs or activity required (ofc ill be on every/ every other day but might not all the time)  my garena account is lvl 14 since i didnt play it for a while and cba to get it higher for nothing (high lvl rooms are places for prems imo)  so im searching for communities that play fws, skilled 5n5s without that stupid testgame shit..   just hit me with recommondations (i&amp;#039;d also join a group of just mates that play here and then)
