     Got banned! Haha was fun thinking I was evading the ban wave but oh well.      Getting me a 360 Elite tomorrow, other is going back to the shop.    Ah well, cba modding the next one will just go legit and join a rental service for most games and buy others, got a LoveFilm trial.      On the plus side I really wanted a new 360 as mine had the old 20Gb hard drive, so at least now I&amp;#039;ll be able to install some stuff.
