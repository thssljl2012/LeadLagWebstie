        Quote (unfair &amp;amp;#064; Wed, 19 Nov 2008, 01:06)   you don&amp;#039;t know what&amp;#039;s directly translated into english since you don&amp;#039;t know portuguese. ppl tend to change original names, don&amp;#039;t you know it yet?   i don&amp;#039;t know what you meant nor i know what&amp;#039;s a besserwisser.   i may be wrong but, wasn&amp;#039;t their richness one of the most important reasons for which they got and they&amp;#039;re still hated? fuck just take a look to their country, if they were fuckin poor they&amp;#039;d have been bombed by everyone and there wouldn&amp;#039;t be a single jew alive     I thought you said to me: &amp;amp;quot;don&amp;#039;t mention all the abrahemic religions, just the important ones&amp;amp;quot; as if I where gonna mention every religion made up since 1000 before christ     while I meant Judaism, Islam, Christianity ofcourse     nvm that.   Directly translated from swe to english I know what &amp;amp;quot;djvulen och frken Prym&amp;amp;quot; means, thats what I said, I also said yes: &amp;amp;quot;people&amp;amp;quot; tend to change original titles, thats why I wouldn&amp;#039;t dare to guess what the english title was. why I knew tha original title was due to wikipedia &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;     a besserwisser is a german word, used in swedish too, for someone who loves to point out unessisary misstakes, &amp;amp;quot;a better knower&amp;amp;quot; directly translated. nevermind that too.  their richness was one of the most important reasons they got followed over the centuaries yes, one of manymany. but today that&amp;#039;s not really important. oh: and they wasnt hated for being rich, merely for HOW they got rich... while christians wheren&amp;#039;t allowed to do some morally questionable services to gain money (bankbusiness cba going through it) jews where.     jelousy    This post was edited by SpAz. on Tue, Nov 18 2008, 11:12pm
