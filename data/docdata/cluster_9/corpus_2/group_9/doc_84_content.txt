 HORRIBLE Tuesday for me.      I had to Western Union myself $1200 from my bank in Texas because I could not remember the PIN # to my check card that I haven't used in over 2 years. The money arrives at Publix but the clerk doesn't have the available cash in his register so he tells me to wait for the other cashier who's on lunch. Roughly 40 minutes later the other cashier shows up and tells me she doesn't have enough money but she can give me $700 cash and then a $500 check that I could get cashed at my bank.    Sssssooo... I walk allllllll the way to Bank of America and they won't cash the check because it's not considered "Certified Funds" so they send me to Rite Aid next door that works with Western Union. The manager ar Rite Aid has a yeast infection and claims that she doesn't have $500.     Mind you, I'm on foot since my car won't be back from Texas until the 8th of May.  I walked allllll the way home, and now I gotta wait until later in the day to walk allllllll the way back to Publix to see if they got the cash so I can walk alllllll the way back home to pay my rent.    Then, I gotta walk alllllllllllll the way back to the bank to get another money order for $2500 to send to the shop in texas that has my car to pay off the balance which will leave me eating Ramen and Kraft mac n cheese for the next 2 weeks.     And I left my ice cold chocolate milk that I bought at Public at Rite Aid.
