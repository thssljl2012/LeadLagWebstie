Golden - That's right, structured as two trades technically.         dcarter - Jones can shoot from 3-pt land. He's career 39% and given the open looks he would get in our offense would shoot better than that. Another indication of his shooting is his career FT% 86.3%. Six years-in that proves he has a stroke.        Nothing wrong with the Boone/Dooling ideal. Although I agree with Hector, it reduces the need for Odom more than it opens up space for him. You save more just moving Farmar for a BS pick.        David - Powell is on a one year, minimum, non-guaranteed deal next year (as is Mbenga). LA doesn't need to trade either of them. They can both be cut if a trade is made for another backup big. Jackson likes Powell thought.        Brock - Interesting that LA had eyes for Brown in the draft. It's curious then that LA didn't think about offering the same minimum deal to Brown that Charlotte did. Maybe they gave that slot to Yue.        Sky - I think anything over 7.25 with years attached locks in Odom (though it's won't be quick). He's 30 in November and going forward revenue is a bigger problem than cap space. I think the next thing to go is the big deals for non-superstar, players over 30. That's where the "Superstar and the merry minimums" battle is waged league wide. If you look at the league's top paid players annually, the list includes lots of "deferred compensation" for those over the peverbial hill. In essence the "Over 36 rule" competitively becomes the "Over 34 rule" for non-superstars. Odom is in that cast. It's not Laker hard ball, it's a league wide "correction". That is basically what they want to legislate in the next CBA by virtue of non-guaranteed deals and/or shorter contracts.
