It would be incredibly stupid to sign Stafford for that much money when you can get Curry for 30 million less.         From the latest reports it's looking VERY likely that there will be a rookie cap in the new CBA. Wait til that kicks in (could very well be in effect for next years draft) then draft your QB without having to pay him a pathetic amount of money when QB is such a massive risk.         Again, I have NO PROBLEM with drafting Stafford, I just have a problem with drafting Stafford for that price when Curry, who is easily a safer pick than Stafford is willing to sign for 30 million less.         When you think about what Matt Ryan got last year with the #3 pick, $40 million guaranteed and $80 million max value is about fair market value for Stafford at #1.  And Curry's theorized contract value was only five years at $55 million: $11 million a year as opposed to the $13.3 million a year for a 6-year, $80 million pact.  The difference is because of position obviously--QBs just make a lot more than LBs.        Why do you care what the Lions pay for their draft pick, anyway?  Is the money coming out of your pocket?  The cap is huge.  I'm okay with taking an extra $2.3 million a year for the right guy as opposed to just going with the cheaper guy.        Besides, it's not like either of those prospects is going to make it through their rookie contracts, so the $80 million max value is largely irrelevant.  If either one becomes the great player they hope they're getting, they'll most likely try to sign him to a new deal about three or four years into their career; if they turn out to be disappointments, then they'll be cut after that span of time.  The only value you ought to be concerned with either way is the guaranteed value--that's what hurts your books if the guy busts.  If he booms, then who cares if you're paying him $80 million?  He'll be worth every penny if he turns into a top-five QB. _________________                nhaOD wrote:           No chance this year a defensive player goes in the first round.
