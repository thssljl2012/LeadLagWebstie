Well I started my new job at ANZ bank last week, and despite having what sounds an interesting title it basically just involves very repetitive computer work. The job itself is not something I really want to do but just want to gain the experience so I can move into other things, but seriosuly they are already making it so hard for me to even have a chance to enjoy it. They keep asking me to do overtime every single day. When I signed up for this job it was 8.30-5pm each day (so 8 and a half hour days) but the last 3 days I have been doing 8-6, which is like an hour and a half overtime every day. It's so full on and I could tolerate this job for now if I was doing the normal hours, but this is overkill. So I'm doing 10 hour days, I come home and am just stuffed. Plus on top of that I'm still doing Saturday's at Dick Smith, so only have one day off each week to recover. Eeek. Kinda in a pickle, don't know what to do as I can't see medoing this long if it keeps up like this. They tell me at work that it's just in a busy phase and hopefully soon they won't need to ask everyone to keep staying back. They can't expect me to keep up with this everyday or I will just fizz out!
