 Ask at El Cid or at the Pro Shop; you should be eligible for 25% off since you are a guest of the Hotel. Unless things have changed much, and I seriously doubt that, about $45 USD or so per person for a "walking" round assuming a "bit" of a price increase.       Carts used to be $25 USD as I recall. They will ask for your room number and names, of course. I think caddies are $20 USD now, plus a nice tip. My last visit to the course was $42 USD, $19 USD caddie, and I tipped $15O pesos.....then tossed my friend (the caddie) an extra $50 pesos for some cool ones after his work day. I used my credit card for the greens fees and caddie, got a good exchange through Bank of America, so my total including tip was around $68 USD all told, I'm sure. I know I played three rounds for about $200 USD. Lar
