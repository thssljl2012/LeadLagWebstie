These teams may or may not, but probably  don't  have the blessings of local government to set-up shop.  Please name one--just one successful franchise that didn't have a prior local government seal of approval.  Many failures can be cited though.  The most glaring was the new Oklahoma City CBA entry, IMO.  The mayor didn't want the team in town, but the owner said he was going to find a venue in town anyway.  Well, everyone knows who won THAT battle.  The Oklahoma City CBA team eventually high-tailed it to Lawton having never played a game in Oklahoma City.      Local government can make life easier for fledgling franchises (such as providing venues at discount rates).  Local government can also make life miserable for those trying to fly  under the radar  (such as shutting down an event because proper procedures were not followed).  When will people learn?!?
