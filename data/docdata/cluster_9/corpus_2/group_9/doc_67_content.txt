Hey ya'll. I know I've been absent of late. Somehow I keep forgetting to check in here. Sorry about that. Good to know things have been running smoothly along in my absence.     Thanks for all the birthday wishes. It went well all in all. Though I got tired of hearing 'how's it feel to be 30?' I wanted to say 'wth? It feels the same as 29 and I'm sure it's gonna feel the same as 31'. Never did like or understand that question. Why do people think getting a year older is supposed to make you feel different than you did the day before?     Anywho... CbA  you know for those pictures of one of my  absolute  favorite men in the entire known universe that I shall worship you forever right? Just sayin'.       Wish I could say something new and exciting is going on for me...but there isn't. But I'm gonna try and do better about showing my face around here a bit more often.
