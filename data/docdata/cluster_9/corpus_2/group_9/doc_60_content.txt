 They filled up the sections directly behind home plate, and turned everybody else away (they claimed it was for security purposes, which I understand). So, there were a whole lot of us watching the big screens at Chickie's &amp; Pete's.  Outside, it was so quiet. I counted 17 limousines wrapped around CitiBank Park. I didn't even see anyone taking pictures. It was kinda eerie to see the sea of red - much like October - and yet, QUIET.  I'm not used to seeing Philadelphia fans showing class.
