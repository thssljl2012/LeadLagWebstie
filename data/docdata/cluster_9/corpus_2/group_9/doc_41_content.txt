Hi,    I read on the back of these dodgy supplements I picked up at Holland &amp; Barrett that long-term high intake of B6 may result in tingling / numbness. They also make my pee fluorescent. Maybe I shouldn't have grabbed the first bottle that said "B-something" along with "Suitable for Vegetarians and Vegans".    So, can anyone recommend supplements available in the UK? I have a varied diet but I cba to worry about b12, &lt;insert vitamin here&gt;, iodine, etc. Don't mind if it means more than one supplement or if they're reassuringly expensive, as long as they're easy to get hold of and cover the main bases that could be problematic.    Cheers,    gutts
