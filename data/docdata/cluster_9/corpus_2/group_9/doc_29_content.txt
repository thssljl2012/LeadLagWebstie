 We're paying second round money to get early/mid first round talent, and the cost was giving up a first round pick in what will be the last pre-rookie cap NFL draft, a draft that will almost certainly be very talent rich and deep (which is to say, top tier talent will be available in rounds 2 and 3 next year, with no need to take the first round cap hit). The Panthers were VERY shrewd with this draft. What's not to like?   I thought next year would be the first year under new CBA rules, if they get a deal done? So if they do some changes, like rookie caps, that would go into effect next draft?
