Well this is really the end for the midwest teams, even if they keep the pbl going. If manchester or vermont or buffalo were in the finals, this would not have happened.       Its clear the only reason they kept the midwest division was to torpedo the CBA. Now they will torpedo the midwest division.      I am not sure whats going to happen to basketball in the midwest, but it is on its last leg.       at least for a while.       The only hope is for someone to do something similar to what the doc has done and buy and run there own league, with all the teams in a close proximity to each other.(like a few hour drive.)
