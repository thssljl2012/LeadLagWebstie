                           Hi Prata,                                                    from what I know, there is... Jeremy Bek(SIM), Terence Foo(Agilent                         ex-team mates), Brendan Goh(maybe he can form another team if he                         can't join us. Check with him lah), ur 3 ex-team members n maybe                         Kevin(SIM/Citibank), Clarence(SIM/Citibank)???                                                    Just some suggestion. But still feel that it's better to compete                         with outside team.                                                    ------------------                          If someone slaps the left side of your face, show him the                         right.
