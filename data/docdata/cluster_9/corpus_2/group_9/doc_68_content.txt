The news reports were remarkably empty of real information and inquiry into reasons or timing.                       The Avengers did not want to participate in that vote, Wasserman said, without a defined business plan for the future of the league.       The timing comes with the league pushing for votes on a revised CBA when they've yet to find an equity partner to buy into the league and help with the current debt. This means no CEO in place (one was there for a shot time after Policy resigned and has already stepped down).  No one knows the direction of the league yet and that must be worked out before you can decide what and how to pay the workers.  The league seems to be putting the cart before the horse.      The league hasn't provided a restructured plan yet but expect the owners to move forward blindly.  This is a sound business decision by Wasserman.
