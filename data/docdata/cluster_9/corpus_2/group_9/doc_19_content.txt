           .....meanwhile the Germans sit in their trenchs knowing they can do nothing until the tanks are right on top of them for now the must listen to the approaching tanks and continue to pray for reinforcments........the brave 88 is fire and fire with only minimul results and will most likely be destroyed soon.  Also the forward machine gun platoon was overrun and is retreating like mad men back to the next line of trenchs.....
