I think if you watch the broadcast of the Brewers clinching game against the Cubs last year, there is a shot of him after   Braun's homerun with a great look on his face as he is cheering Braun that says it all about the moment.            You talkin' about that cat who looks like Judge Ito? I love that guy.        I'm not sure if it's the same guy you are talking about, but does this guy sit right at the corner (where the dugout meets the roof of the player runway) and he always has his glove ready on every pitch to a right hander? He has coarser, lightly graying black hair and sits not to far up from where Baseball Bob sits.     If this is the same guy, he works at US Bank. I use to work there about 10 years ago, although I didn't really know him. I still eat lunch about once a week at the Lake View Market inside the US Bank building and pretty much see him every time I eat there (we apparently eat lunch at the same time). As a matter of fact, I was there today and saw him.
