I have spoken with the commissioner of Hockey East about how all of the other leagues are calling obstruction, but HOckey East is not.  It should not surprise you that he said that all league commissioners hear the same complaint... that the OTHER leagues are calling it right.      and as for players leaving early... there is no reason for players to leave before their junior years unless they were undrafted.  The undrafted ones are the ones who go earliest, because nobody has their rights, until they sign them.         that said, I do think that college hockey is turning into a good coach with great freshmen and sophomores and bad upperclassmen... and if the coach can get the boys to gel, they will go far in the NCAA tourney.      no more great senior classes in college hockey, no way.
