 1) The train from below the airport to Gare centrale takes about 20 minutes and costs 3 per person. Your hotel is about 4 minutes' walk from Gare centrale: cross the road to Citibank, walk under the archway and just beyond the little red-brick church you will see flags, that's it (opposite the casino).      A taxi for the same journey would cost about 35.      2) Of course, note that a cellphone is known as a GSM here. I know you can rent them at the Radisson SAS Hotel so it's not impossible you can also rent them at the Windsor. You can get one from Locaphone at the airport, in the arrivals hall:  brusselsairport.be/en/.
