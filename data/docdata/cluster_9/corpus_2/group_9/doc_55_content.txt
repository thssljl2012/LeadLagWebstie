I've always hated that   bank you call customer service and you get India. For fun you should call customer service and start swearing it's hilarious. They threaten to hang up on   you.       I live close to one of BOA's operation centers in Jacksonville, and worked there on a contract job last year.  WHEN YOU CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE, YOU ARE NOT TALKING TO SOMEONE IN INDIA..... they actually work here in the US!  In the building where I worked, there were many Indians and the women even wear their saris to work.  I felt like I was working in little India!  What really bugged me was that they would stand near the elevators on their cell phones talking for hours in their own language.  I guess they were talking to friends and family in India.  If we American's did something like that instead of working at our desks, we would be fired!
