     I don't like Bank of America,,,even the name gives me the creeps. I had only one dealing with them and it was enough for me to know,,,they will NEVER be my bank of choice.         Here's a question you may like on the lighter side of banking  LOL......does anyone have a "piggy bank" I do. It is a pink female pig. She is dressed in ballerina attire. Complete with tiarra and tutu. When I gather loose change from my purse, around the house, car, I put it in the piggy bank. After the change machines get their cut of 10% or more, I end up with a nice amount I wouldn't have had otherwise.
