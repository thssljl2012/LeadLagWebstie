"i have fond memories of you, pissing in a sink", "can i get a minute of not being nervous and thinking about my dick", "big wet bottle in my fist, big wet rose in my teeth, i'm a perfect piece of ass", "put me in a chair, fuck me, then make me a drink", etc. etc.             "get over here i wanna kiss yr skinny throat" also i love the reference to citibank lights in mistaken for strangers        ~*~* _________________ barely listening
