         A couple of days ago, an older gentleman walks into a local Bank of America, waits in line, and casually robs the place for between $700 and $1000. Afterward, he strolls out the door, down the street and disappears.  Yesterday afternoon in the next town up, the same older gentleman walks into a Chase bank, waits in line, and casually robs the place for an undisclosed amount of money. Afterward, he strolls out the door, down Main Street and disappears.  The man is in his early 60s and was unarmed when he robbed both banks. Some of us believe its a local man, and possibly the same man who robbed another local bank a few years back.  Our hero.
