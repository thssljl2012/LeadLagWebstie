No. Though I wouldn't bet on the latter still being there in 12 months.   I think you're being niave mate.     Does AIG sponsor Manchester United b/c of their CEO?   Does Carlsberg sponsor Liverpool b/c of their CEO?   Does the Bank of America sponsor the Boston Red Sox b/c of their CEO?     You get my gist.     I don't think ARocca was poached. He wanted to be the CEO of the club, but didn't get the position. He then applied for the North position, which isn't poaching. Apart from a brief period in the 90's, the Collingwood brand has been the biggest in the competition since the 30's.
