Also agreed.....   My fear is that this big draft fix is so important and such a big change that the union is going to have a hissy fit, we will not have a CBA, and it will go into lockout and/or have a cap-less year. Once you go cap-less, you never go back..... or, at the very least, it would be tough to go back.
