We removed inactives from the tag.      CBA crashed &amp; was going afk until after the planned end date.      Smokey moved, said he'd be back when his internet got reconnected at his new place &amp; was gone for 3 weeks.       Taipan went on a planned trip with 9 days left in the round &amp; had no internet access for that period of time.      Troll was a late start, never got more then semi-active &amp; had been afk for 75+ ticks when he was removed.      Anyone who was still active &amp; contributing to our alliance is still in the tag.   Edgar &amp; Merlin who both had less score then Taipan did when he was removed, are still both in the tag.      I left the inactives in longer then I normally might of, simply because I had cranked the taxes up to 5% &amp; set it so that only the inactives were paying taxes. I wanted to milk them for scan funds as long as possible.      So yes we did kick some members &amp; jumped back into the top alliance average from it, but the people kicked were all people who were inactive &amp; deserved to be kicked.     Raising our average was simply an inevitable side effect of doing a little spring house cleaning.
