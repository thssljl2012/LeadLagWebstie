Before we talk about other national bodies, I wonder whether those national bodies like CBA, KBA, PBSI, SBA etc are funded by public funds. The CBA, for example has sponsors like Fedex.      BAM, are funded by funds from the public and quasi government bodies.      As for tennis, I believe the Thomas, Uber &amp; Sudirman Cups in terms of spectators and television audiences dont even come near the Davis &amp; Fed Cups.
