      I'm pretty sure that only a handful of full MLE deals have been handed out in the last 2 summers and between the economy and a new CBA in 2 years, it's more likely that even fewer or none at all will be offered this summer.         The climate just isn't there for that kind of gamesmanship. If a team offers Ariza a full MLE deal it will only be because they feel he's worth it to them.
