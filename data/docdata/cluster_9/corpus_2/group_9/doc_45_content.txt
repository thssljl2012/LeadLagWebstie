Plus they sent out a new catalog  yesterday filled with all kinds of goodies. Really cool skirts and convertible pants/shorts.  AND we need a new tent, but will wait for the January sale for that along with our 10% back. But those skirts are just so freakin cute!!!   *sigh sigh sigh*  I hate you, Bank of America. HATE YOU!       Yeah.... we didn't have REI in Florida.  Now I'm all obsessed with it.  I haven't even seen their catalog... I would be a goner, for sure  .
