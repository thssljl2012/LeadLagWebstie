                                I think the pick your opponent in the first round only to the conference champion is a FANTASTIC idea.  Why not make every single game matter even that much more....         I mean 90% of the time, the team will pick the 8th seed, but I bet you the Mavs of 2 years ago would have gone elsewhere than go against the team that oddly matched up really well against them........         This year I actually think the Cavs might want to try to go against the  Pistons  over the young, athletic (though now horribly injured)  Bulls ....the Cavs have had their number in the past few playoffs and they aren't a team on the rise like Chicago might be, just needing that nudge of confidence....they're injured, but so too are the bulls.....         I like the idea, have the top overall team select it's first round opponent, then have teams 2-8 that are left be matched up on record, with division leaders getting the higher seed as the only non record prejudice....         I think that would be fantastic, when I heard of that in the CBA, I thought, man what a cool idea.  Get's teams motivated to play hard to the end for those on top and definitely makes things interesting....I mean imagine if a team like the Cavs for some odd reason picks the  Heat  in the first round and gets upset (not likely, just for conversation because the Cavs height and inside outside and James could cause the Heat fits even though the Heat tried to rectify/balance this with Jermaine, he's not quite balancing it)....would they be scratching their heads even more?         I like the idea....I really like the idea.  Just a nice twist for the NBA if they did it.
