The bank that houses the little theater is now called Bank of America. It's at about 4901 W. Irving Park at the back alley of the bank, next to a huge parking lot. They just ran THE MASKED MARVEL. I only got to see the last chapter. Not a favorite, but the people who put on the shows do their best to get good 16mm prints of serials, which you all know is not that easy! After the baby is a little bigger, I'll be attending again from time to time! - Uncle Frank Chandler
