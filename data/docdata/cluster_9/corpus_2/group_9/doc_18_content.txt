I would hope you would have facts or information to support that opinion. I would almost go out on limb and say they have the best business model in the league. Rochestor pays a lot for that arena and they dont get as big of crowds as they say, the Sea Dawgs dont pay as much for there arena and there are others reason for believing they do. And it sounds like the players love playing in Wilmington and for that organization, which probably means they never have trouble getting paid and they are taken care of in other ways such as living.                      Ironically, almost the same things were said about East Kentucky of the CBA until recently.   Great business model!   Now, they've closed-up shop and left a trail of unpaid bills behind.
