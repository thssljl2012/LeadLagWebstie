Because it only takes 1-3 signings of the top 12 to set the value of the other picks and they have previous years as barometers. The only that it would work is if all the top teams agreed to hold out all the picks together, but then the NFLPA would take the owners to court with a slam dunk collusion case.        As far as why they don't change it, its because they are still under the current CBA. When that expires next year there will be a hard push for the cap.
