  Ooooh I learned some juicy gossip. His brother lives in the next town over. Apparently he was a co-founder of Countrywide too.      Retired guy, that sure looks likea fantastic rate for non o-o. What's your existing rate? Heck I'm going to call B of A to see about refi-ing my non o-o properties!      Thanks Charter. I felt like I was talking with a brick wall. BTW-Wouldn't you think they would have had the courtesy of stating that in their letter?
