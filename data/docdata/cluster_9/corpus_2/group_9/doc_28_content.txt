           48 minutes into the action:      The Soviet advance slows down, as fire from the German 88's knock out 2 T34's, and disrupt their respective platoons, forcing the Red tankers to pull back and re organize. Contact with the HQ's must be re established, as many units are in low supply, ranging too far ahead of their HQ's.      German Pioneers doggedly hang on to their forward positions in the center, taking out a T34 and contributing to the confusion of the Soviet spearhead. Massed tank and mortar fire on the entrenched pioneers achieve nothing. Riflemen are just behind, while close assault troops mop up the retreating Germans in the south, pushing them west.      Another German probe is viewed to the north- no tank sightings yet, it doesn't appear to be a reconaisance in force. Contact has been lost with the German southern probe. The German's stiffened resistance in the center has them holding on to a draw.         The Soviet Forces must prevail! Red soldiers, slay the Fascists, or be summarily excecuted yourselves!
