 We've all seen plenty of rookies take home huge pay days without playing a snap andthis yrs 3rd overall pick looks to take home a contract worth 60-70M with 23-25M guaranteed. Makes vets cringe with envy and owners with losing squads want to vacate that position at all costs.   The new CBA should allow for a new rookie pay scale with the top guaranteed to make yr 1 3M, yr 2 3.5M yr 3 5M and become a restricted FA after the 3rd yr. and so forth with the remaining picks. That saves the owners crazy loot that could be allocated to other players in the form of guranteed contracts.  I jus think ifrookies were given shorter guaranteed contracts with veterans receiving guranteed extended contracts it would make everyone happy.
