      If they walk it would actually appear to be virtually impossible...        This is a vary salient point... I'm presuming that we are considering here the CBA limitation imposed on teams of not being able to go over the CAP as a result of signing "new" players... and that this restriction of course does not apply to signing players to higher contracts already currently under contract that result in exceeding the CAP...        So it would be a matter of which is the better return for Buss to either work out trades if at all possible to either retain those three players or at least some of them or of this is not possible then to sign and trade at least one of them if that is considered the better return...        The issue remains that most if not all of those three players will likely be the "better bargain" for the Lakers to retain as opposed to trading any one of them in a sign and trade scenario not considering the luxury tax issue of course...  and of course the 100 million threshold will certainly have to be factored in for those who tend to focus on that reality...
