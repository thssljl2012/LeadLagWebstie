 they did some stuff here with rugby players and the media ate that stuff up. They had a few working in a soup kitchen, another had set up some kind of refuge for kids from his old area etc, it got some very good positive publicity at a time when it was needed. The afl players need to do a bit more than a few footy clinics.      I hear what you&#039;re saying re global economic crisis, but it&#039;s been going longer than most realise. It&#039;s now nearly at the end of it&#039;s 2nd year, but no one really knew about it until a few months ago because the finance bozos had managed to keep it very well covered up, but when you see top guys from ABN Amro, Maquarie, CBA etc all eating $4 food court food you know that the $hit has really hit the fan. Unemployment is set to escalate as more and more companies realise they can&#039;t afford to keep people. The frist thing they did was not renew contracts. Not technically sacking anyone so no announcements necessary, now they have to start slashing jobs as they are slaves to their shareholders. As unemployment rises, people are looking over their shoulder wondering if they&#039;re next, so like hell they&#039;ll buy a car etc when they may be joining the job queue next week.    My take on the Rudd stimulus package is he will keep giving them out until the markets start lifting again, so he can say "see, told you it would work" whilst keeping people happy with money for nothing, not caring that the money has to come from somewhere.. cynical maybe...      anyhow, that&#039;s my soapbox for today..
