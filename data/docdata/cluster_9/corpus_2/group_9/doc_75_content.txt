Well you guys certainly have the right to be critical of joe newman and aba, but the fact is, it was the pbl that left him, broke away and claimed to be better and different.  Inasmuch as we want to believe it is better (the pbl) there are still somethings that are similar.       All of this is so sad. What has happened to the old CBA from the nineties and even up to 2005?      I know, I know,  you can't live in the past, but the tv show "All in the family" is certainly better television than "american idol." ( I just can't get my girlfriend or my sister to agree with me on that) .
