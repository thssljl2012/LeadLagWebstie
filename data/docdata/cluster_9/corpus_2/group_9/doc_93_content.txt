I agree, death toll is  &#9829;  &#9829;  &#9829;  &#9829; , i never play it. Versus is pretty  &#9829;  &#9829;  &#9829;  &#9829;  too cus SI are so rubbish nowadays, sorry cba to articulate, too ill, "sHeeT" (the pink hearts) will have to do.    Really disappointed with Versus, really good gametype, but I spend more time watching Survivors play against really easy zombies than i do playing myself, or I get bored batting through waves of drunken OAP's while killing a few harmless SI.    I'm all for something that makes it more difficult to survive (&lt;3 survival mode)
