           Turn 2      Heavy fire from the advancing Russian Armor on the German forward positions in answer to an 88 battery knocking out a T34 at long range. The 88's are dug in within suburbs- a lucky shot knocks one of the battery out, disrupts their communications, and sends a cheer out from the Russian lines! The rest of the Soviet forces race to their deployment areas as the Armor engages the German forces.....no sign yet of Rocky or Bullwinkle.....
