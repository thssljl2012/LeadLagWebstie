   I have to admit that after I watched the show this morning, I called my husband immediately and had a mini meltdown!       My husband was laid off from his job at Bank of India, I mean Bank of America, just before Christmas. I am fortunate to have a great nanny job that pays ok but has no benefits at all. But we're ok. We are both almost 25 and only married for 2 and a half years. We started talking about planning a family, but after what I had seen on the show I'm sure it will not happen anytime soon! My husband went back to our local community college and was lucky enough to get financial aid. He will then try to become a police officer. My dreams of being a first grade teacher will have to go on the back burner for awhile. This is how we are "sacrificing" to stay afloat. We'll put having children and both going back to college on hold till this recession is over. I don't understand how people can live beyond means and go about being fine like they have no worries and no debt.       I live in Chicago. We pay the most taxes, have the biggest crime rate and the dumbest people running this place! Instead of hiring police officers, which Chicago hasn't done in 3 years, they're letting crime run rampant and then expect to get the olympics over here! What a joke! Instead of out sourcing to Frank in India, give someone here a job so that they wouldn't have to turn to crime to survive.       Sorry about the last rant.....      Did anyone listen to the speach last night? I was too distracted to hear what he said. I was counting the standing ovations after every sentence!
