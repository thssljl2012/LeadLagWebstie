LeBron hasn't signed an extension because if he signs before 2010, he leaves millions upon millions of dollars on the table via CBA rules.  It's THAT SIMPLE.  And even IF LeBron leaves...  He won't go to the Knicks. That's one thing I'm almost sure of.   After all.....They don't play defense.   Oh, and LeBron said that. Not me
