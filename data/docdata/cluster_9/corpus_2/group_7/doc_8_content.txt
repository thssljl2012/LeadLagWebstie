          Salute me doesn't take as long as you think, if you keep doing co-op as a good medic you can get 20-30k exp per round easy and as a realy good spec ops you can get 40-50k. Spec ops didn't click as much as medic for me cus of the strange simlaritieswith ashigh level pvp monking on guild wars. Also a lvl 28 medic with splicer does insane damage.    Master spy takes half an hour, just on game faqs for a walk through and ctrl-f the intel you want then load the part of the level its in.    OMGWTFBBQ look around the forums for the short cut if u cba to work for it lol    killing machine well........ 7000 kills to go      Just borrowed burnout off a friend who never plays it so can play you guys on it next time     Message Edited by nataku_05 on   04-02-2009   12:20 PM
