I just checked our bank account we should still have a good amount of money left. WRONG. They charged us 4 fucking overdraft fees and we didnt motherfucking overdraft!!! There is none from last month so I know for damn sure its not a delayed reaction. Im trying to call them and of course all circuts would be fucking busy. Oh Im pissed I am so motherfucking pissed Im am sure there there is steam commming out of my ears. WHAT THE FUCK. We both have our cards there are no cherges made that we didnt make. I would love to know what in the name of runny butt pudding is their logic? That is fucking it we are offically DONE with bank of america. We are switching over to USAA as of 3 minutes ago. Im so mad I dont even think there is a level of angry to describe what I feel right now.
