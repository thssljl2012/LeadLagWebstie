The multi-touch trackpad with no button is amazing. The trackpad is a button but I don't click it I just tap it. I love four finger expose and three finger back/forward oh and two finger scrolling. It all rocks.      Pictures:            Oh, and an added pusssy, under a quilt, for your viewing pleasure..                              Very nice, Im loving that ***** cat
