      I always ask myself the same thing...I currently own one. It's all awesome, and you get all excited and can't put it down for the first week or so that you have it. But then, it gets blah.  But, I think it's pretty useful to have sometimes.  For example, I had an 8gb, but then sold it because it wasn't enough space for me.  I didn't have an iTouch for at least a few months, and I did actually miss it.  The calender (that can use as your day planner, which i REALLY like), notes, contacts, internet (when you have wifi), calculator (now a scientific calculator with the updated one) really do come in handy.  I got a 32gb on Christmas.  I love being able to use it during class hah    I ebay a lot, so, having the eBay app on it is nice.. and they currently created a Bank of America app, that's nice too.. yeah you have the internet to use, but it's so much faster when you have the app.    I think it's worth it but not worth it at the same time.  If it were about &#036;100 less, then, okay.
