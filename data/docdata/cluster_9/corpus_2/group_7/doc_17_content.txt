 1st problem is that you took the dead cap info from the jetscap site, and didnt bother checking the accuracy. The guy who runs the site included unpaid bonus money in those figures, and that simply isnt the case in dead cap hits. If a player is cut prior to receiving a bonus, the money doesnt count against the cap. The means most of the guys under your cant be cut list, CAN be cut. (Im not sayiing they wll, just that they can)  2nd issue is that there is ZERO chance all those big roster bonuses arent converted, so that the hit is spread out over the remaining years of the contract. and greatly reducing the cap hits for five players. (that one move gets the team roughly 10 million under the cap)  3rd theres no chance the club cuts Moore, Baker Dearth and likely Bowens. Contracts will be reworked, Moore as in the case in point two. Bowens Baker Ellis and woody however can all be re-worked to lower their hits. Unfortunately, I think its more likely that Barrett takes a pay cut, rather than being cut, until they have time to fill some holes.  4th, there are a handful of players that NEED pay increases this year to comply with the new 30% rule that came into effect when theowners opted out of the CBA. There is no getting around this, and it could make players like Jones tradable.  5th, along with the above, due to the "revised" CBA there are certain players that are due bonuses after 2010 that will have part of that money count against this years cap.  And last, you have a 19 man roster and only 23 million left to fill it out. And all those guys you didnt list will have dead cap hits that will lower that avaiable space.
