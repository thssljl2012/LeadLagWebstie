When you adjust the numbers for LTBE's that weren't earned, the numbers are even less promising. I really hope that the numbers you found had been already adjusted, because otherwise we're in the bottom-10 for cap space this coming offseason. Here's the adjusted numbers in order from most cap space to least:    Tampa Bay $65.6m  Philadelphia $55.3m   Kansas City $52.3m   Miami $45.8m  Green Bay $41.7m  ---  Arizona $37m   Denver $35.6m   Tennessee $34.7m  Detroit $34.4m  SF 49ers $30.2m  ---  Cincinnati $29.8m  Minnesota $29.1m  Buffalo $28.9m  Atlanta $28.4m  Chicago $27.5m  Baltimore $26m  Houston $25.5m  New England $25.4m  Jacksonville $23.8m  Pittsburgh $23.5m  New York Giants $21.7m  Cleveland $20.9m  ---    San Diego $18.8m    St Louis $16.4m  Indianapolis $14.8m  Carolina $14.3m  Seattle $12.7m  New Orleans $12.2m   Oakland $11.7m   ---  Dallas $8.4m  New York Jets $3.0m  Washington $1.1m    I believe that there is a certain date that all teams have to be above the cap minimum. Looking at the teams at the top of the list, there will have to be some serious resigning, restructuring, and FA activity in order to get there. I wouldn't be surprised if one of the teams with a load of cap space overspent for Sproles, kinda like how the Jags went crazy and spent big bucks on below average FAs last year (Porter, Florence, etc.).    Any ideas as to why we don't make use of the LTBE loophole in the CBA? It looks as though we should be doing millions better this year than we are listed at, which seems odd to me.
