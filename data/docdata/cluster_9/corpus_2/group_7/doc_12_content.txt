        QUOTE (OhKahne9 &#064; Feb 9 2009, 01:23 PM)             Just a heads up if any of you plan on going the Coke 600 @ Lowe's Motor Speedway in May. I just paid &#036;59 bucks for a ticket in Turn 2. I sat there for the Bank of America 500 last fall and the seats are good. I thought it was a good deal.               Damn really? That's dirt cheap, when I went to the 500 tickets were four times that I'll have to look into that, hopefully there are less than 10 blown right rears this year haha.
