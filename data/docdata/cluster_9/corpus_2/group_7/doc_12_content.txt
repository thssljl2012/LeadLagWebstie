Anyone tried polenta? I got a pack for 1 ages ago and today FINALLY tried it... I did it thick then put it in a dish to go cold then sliced it (looks a bit like cheese then) and fried it (for the healthy you can grill it too) I've just served it to the girls (CBA to cook so they are having polenta wedges, turkish cheese in breadcrumbs and some raw veg, lol... finger food type which they are now eatting as they watch tom and jerry, lol... Era LOVES it and whilst I was frying some and sorting the food out she kept coming back for more!!! if Serena eats it ok she'll have that in her lunch box tommorrow too!!!
