      The union only has a beef with the team doing the tagging, that they are in compliance with the terms of the CBA that specifies that they act in good faith to employ tagged player at the franchise tender amount. IOW, this sets the bar for a long term extension given to a tagged player by the team that has tagged him.  If the Pats wish to retain Cassel and give him a long terms deal than they have to act in good faith by offering him a deal that pays him the franchise amount over that deal.  Once traded, the union can't do jack as it's the market, and not the players union, which sets player contract value. Cassel will get whatever some team is willing to pay him.
