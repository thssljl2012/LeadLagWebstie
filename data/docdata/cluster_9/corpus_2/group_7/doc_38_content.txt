For three years CV has been the most naturally talented guy on the team.  It's always been the CV mental issues.   Are they temporarily cured with a contract year?  Or are they more permanently cured with age and experience (which is granted most other players but not CV because of his past issues).  The great thing is that the entire league knows about this connundrum.  That is why we can probably lock up him up for 3-years/$21mm.    If it was a "contract" year problem, we've got a slightly but not much overpaid version of Donyell Marshall.   If he's matured, we've got Antawn Jamison in his prime, but aren't paying him the crazy $14 million a year he got many years ago as a result of the prior CBA.  It is win-win either way right now with CV.
