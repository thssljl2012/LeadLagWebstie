For the Love of God, people are BAWWWWW'ing left right and centre about this despite knowing nothing about how this weapon is going to be implimented.      It could be put to use in a taunt sense, rendering the scout vunerable for 2-3 seconds... which is most unlikely as they've already introduced a nerf aspect to him by denying the use of double jump.      Or, what i'm hoping for, is that the user will have to right click to toss the ball up, and then left click to swing and hit it, introducing an element of skill to it as there is the possiblility for a "swing and a miss".      (Fully aware someone may ahve already said it, CBA reading back through the dozen or so pages to find out)
