Len strolls in...     With one eye brow raised he sees Angelos behind the bar.     Len: Um, Angelos where are you behind bar?     Angelos gives a friendly smile : I'm just filling for Twain and Oz.     Len : Um, why?     Angelos : Haven't you been reading the clone's news letter lately?     Len with a sheepish grin : Well, I've been busy with my new job at the hospital and you know the usual stuff  I do like fighting off CbA's advances. What's up?     Angelos nodded : Well, the base is all a titter since Aurry is in charge of this pratice drills with the soldiers. You never know which of clones are going to get picked for the next drill.   I heard about the next drill and it's with Fantasy.      Len: Oh, well that's a given. I'm sure CbA, will grab Fantasy.     Angelos: I'm not to sure about that!     Len : Why?     Angelos : Aurry stated that needs to be PG rated.     Len: Oh well cancels out CbA.     Angelos : And Philly.     Len nods in agreement : True,  I'm sure there's a brave soldier who can do a drill assignment with Fantasy in a PG setting. right?     Angelos looks around the bar : Maybe, Mezz or Footsie.     Len : Maybe, but Angelos why are you bartending?  I never saw you mix a drink before.     Angelos chuckles : I have this book of drinks. I know the rules.  I think I can handle this.     Len : And you know the main rule right?     Angelos: Yes, don't let CbA under any circumstances.     Len grins : Good boy!
