Scenario 1:     IF  the Chargers were to  cut/release  LT this year, the savings/cost would be as follows:     Cap Cost -   2.066 M  in accelerated cap cost (total remaining pro-rated bonus money)      Comparing this to the  8.791M  cap cost if they kept LT, it can be seen the team would save   6.725 M  in  cap  dollars .     One still has to factor in the cost of a "replacement" RB to the "savings" (i.e. deduct the salary cap dollars of the replacement).       Scenario 2:     IF  the Chargers let the current contract stand for 2009 and chose to  cut/release  LT in 2010 the numbers change quite a bit:     Cap Cost -   0M   in accelerated cap cost ( there is not any  remaining pro-rated bonus money)      Comparing this to the   8.0 M  cost if they kept LT, it can be seen the team would save  8.0  in  cap  dollars.      As before, it also doesn't factor in the cost of a replacement RB.           NOTE: The original post used numbers from 2 websites regarding the bonus pro-ration. This weekend I took the time to re-examine those numbers and compare them against the USA Today salary database and delved further into the CBA intricacies. It turns out that the websites were in error and that the pro-ration of LT's bonus started the year he signed the contract unless the bonus was deferred to the start of the extension. I've thus updated and correct this post based upon the re-examination and that it was not a deferred bonus, but was payed the year the extension was signed ('04). This correlates 100% with the USA Salary database numbers and all other website information save for the two which had the bonus spread over the remaining years ('10 and '11). All changes to the post have been done in a  red font  for clarity                          Thanks for editing the information, Silly.     If it were only $2 millionish in cap savings, I don't think it would be an issue.     I thought I'd lost my mind because I was under the impression after hearing and reading from multiple sources that the 2009 cap savings would be in the $6 million range. For this reason, I expect there to be a restructuring.     Having said that, I'm sure that there are many who would beg to differ that I haven't lost my mind.
