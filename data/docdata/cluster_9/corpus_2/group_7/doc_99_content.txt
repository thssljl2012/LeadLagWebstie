         A Tale of a Citibank Employee                                                                                                                          The youthful and enthusiastic Chuck moved to Texas and bought a donkey    for $100 from a farmer, who agreed to deliver the donkey the next day.    The following day, the farmer drove up in an empty truck.                                                                                              Son, I have some bad news. The farmer was glum. The donkey died.                                                                                  That's fine, Chuck said. Just give me my money back.                                                                                              Cant do that. Ive spent the money already.                                                                                                        Okay, then just bring me the dead donkey.                                                                                                            The farmer scratched his head. What ya gonna do with a dead donkey?                                                                                  Chuck grinned. Im going to raffle him off.                                                                                                          The farmer crossed his arms. You cant raffle off a dead donkey!                                                                                    Sure I can, Chuck said. Just watch me. I just wont tell anyone hes    dead.                                                                                                                                                A month later, the farmer met up with Chuck. What happened with the dead donkey?                                                                                                                                              I raffled him off, Chuck said. I sold 500 tickets at $2 apiece and      made a profit of $998 before subtracting the $100 for the dead donkey.                                                                                The farmer was puzzled. Didnt anyone complain?                                                                                                      Just the guy who won, so I gave him his $2 back.                                                                                                    Chuck went on to work for Citibanks investment banking unit where he      designed and sold packaged product investments including S &amp; P triple-A    rated collateralized mortgage obligations, CDOs and CMBs.  They were easy to sell to Morgan Stanley and especially easy to dump at Wachovia and Lehman Brothers. It was a huge success while it lasted!
