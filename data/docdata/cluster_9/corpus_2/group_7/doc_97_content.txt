I feel in a deal like that, we should legitimately be able to pawn off Jared Jefferies' contract. Marbury, Jefferies and Anthony Roberson for B.Miller, Kenny Thomas and Sheldon Williams works under the CBA regulations and frees the Kings of $20 million immediately, which gives them the incentive to take on the additional year of Jefferies' contract. If the Knicks threw in $3 million, I don't see how it couldn't work; we could even by a 2nd round pick at a ridiculous price ($2 million) in a seperate deal to encourage them to take Jefferies.
