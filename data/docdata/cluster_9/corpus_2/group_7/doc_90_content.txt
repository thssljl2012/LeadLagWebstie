If I'm a member of the NFLPA, I would want some assurance that the money really is going to be spread out to other players, and not end up simply moving from a rookie's pockets to the owners.  One concern Upshaw claimed to have was that teams would cut veterans in favor of rookies simply to save money.  All of this will certainly be one of the major topics in the next CBA.                      The rookie cap is money taken from veterans, since the total cap number remains the same.  I won't be surprised to see something implemented that's more akin to what the NBA does with their slotting.  Top players still get a lot of money, but it's the second contract that's most important, even for the best of the best.
