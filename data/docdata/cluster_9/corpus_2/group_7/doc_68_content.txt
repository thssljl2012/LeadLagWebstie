We're a family of 6 at the moment so I got mine in robert dyers think it's a morphy richards one (I'm upstairs... it's downstairs... CBA to go down and check, pmsl) it's a 6.5 litre one... and it does us great and was something like 26... saw cheaper ones but wanted to be able to make more for inlaws ect.      Chicken legs will do fine in a curry!!! I don't eat curry... but they'd be fine for anything really... I had some I chucked in a cream of chicken soup and there's still some more going into a tomato and chicken pasta bake when I get a chance, lol!
