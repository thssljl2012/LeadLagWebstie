Definitely "Tubbed" with the rear end "Narrowed", which indicates to me there is probably a WHOLE lot of horsepower up front. While I like these cars left in stock trim, I REALLY like them in "Pro Street" configuration! You have not lived, and cannot possibly appreciate what this is all about unless you have actually ridden in, or at least seen one with the throttle wide open.          This shot is reminicent of the typical type of car brought to the parking lot behind the Bank of America in Vanuys, CA. on a Saturday night for the sole purpose of lightening someones wallet by a few hundred dollars or more in the mid seventies. This was an era that I have fond memories of, while somehow managing to live through it all.    I guess what I'm trying to say here, is that to some of us, this IS original condition. Well, kinda anyway.            Oh, Frank, did I mention what a GREAT job you did of portraying this magnificent piece of machinery?      ........Bruce
