                                Do they attempt to terminate his deal? Considering the reasoning behind the length of the deal and its association with the records, do they have a leg to stand on? Do they actually release him?    As was with the case with Giambi, they can't do a thing about the contract. If his alleged positive steriod test results are true, it happened before PEDS were outlawed in the CBA. As for THEIR motivation for signing him, it has nothing to do with him breaking any current CBA rules, so they wouldn't have a legal leg to stand on. And though the Yanks have tons of money and have wasted tons of it in the past, I don't foresee them eating his contract.......
