   IMO the team that should sign Manny is a team that needs that kind of player to put them over the top. The Mets come to mind. I can't believe they're not even considering it. He could also steal some thunder from the Yankees. The Giants aren't in that category yet. Not even close.   well, if you read the financial papers you would know that the Mets lost about 500 million dollars in the Bernie Madoff scandal, and there's a good chance that Citibank is going to cancel their 400 million dollar deal with the Mets to call their new stadium "Citifield'.  Since they're accepting bailout money, alot of people think that spending that much money on naming rights is ridiculous. Even despite that, they've still managed already to spend alot of money this offseason when they signed KRod, traded for Putz and re-signed Oliver Perez. I don't think they're going to find another 25 million per year in their petty cash for Manny.
