What????   NYC Catholic (AA) league is bar none the highest rated hs division in America! Are you kidding me, go ask any HS expert. The CHSAA produces more D-I players every year than any conference in America. Just look at college rosters. The only conference that comes close is the "Red West Division" in Chicago's Public League. Plus we have the PSAL in NYC with Lincoln, Boys &amp; Girls, Grady, Cardozo, Jefferson, JFK, and plenty of other teams.     Then if you leave NYC we still have a crazy amount of talent. If you go to Long Island you'll find Amityville, Uniondale, Freeport, Hempstead, Walt Whitman and plenty of others.    Then if if you go north of the Bronx you'll find Mount Vernon, Peekskill, New Rochelle, White Plains, Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, Bishop Maginn, Schenectady, Troy, Albany CBA, Albany Academy, Utica Proctor, Henninger, Corcoran, Jamesville DeWitt, Syracuse CBA, Rochester East, Buffalo Bennett and the list goes on and on and on and on.      NY is the hardest state to win a true championship. Because the PSAL has their own title, so does the CHSAA, and the NYSPHSAA champ. Then they all come together for the federation title which is extremely hard to get! Sorry, but no one comes close to New York State in basketball. We have more players on D-I rosters than anyone else in America. We football is in texas in what basketball is in NY. The crazy thing is we have so much talent not even playing, bc there's so many options and other things to do in NYC. Its crazy!
