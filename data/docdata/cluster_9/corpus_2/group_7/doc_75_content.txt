Nuff with dissing bloodline. it's getting old.    I must say that the guild has touched me, with all the forum posts i've made they're still only able to /puke me ingame. It makes me proud as to me it means i've succeed with the posts. Instead of actually thinking something creative to say to defend themselves or simply politely asking to stop whatever bothered them, half of the guild has their /puke macro ready on hotbar. Looks to me that the posts were right about them then.    Thanks for all the giggles, don't think i cba anymore      Good luck with the boots meph
