He didn't need to be tested, he admitted it himself.      I do agree with much of your post though.  I think the records will stand with no asterisk.      The court of public opinion will be a far more severe penalty to all involved in this one.  The Scarlet Letter will follow all these guys around the rest of their lives.                      I think Selig suggesting that he'll restore Aaron as the all-time HR king is the goofiest thing I've ever heard.      That be a 55 gallon drum of worms to open.
