I agian honestly cba about lower levels what i do care is the chance to enjoy the game in its fullest which require a population thats atleast med/med                      I would argue it would depend on your definition of fun.  A lot of us do enjoy the lower Tiers for various reasons and perhaps the fact that you don't "Alt it up" skews your viewpoint. I imagine if your all about T4, it does get frustrating when bugger all happens.     What I would say, however, is that if your not enjoying the server, for what ever reason, rather then trying to change the server to fit your own ends by calling for forced merges and the like, you might want to consider re-rolling to a server with a T4 more to your tastes. I personally enjoy the easy going nature of Burlok and I fear that we'd lose that in a merge.      (This not a veiled attack on Precept, so kindly don't flame me for this. I appreciate the effort Precept have put into the game and they do have some lovely fellas... Also some Arsehole but we'll forgive them that.   )
