 No. But go into a chat room or a conversation board on the internet or poll fans outside of a game for their opinions on the situation and I will guarantee you the results. You have to actually ask them as I am sure that they are not losing sleep over it either.  Notice that I said NEUTRAL to very negative. Many fans will be neutral. My point is that a very, very small percentage will actually back lying fatboy and his actions. That is the truth.  If you find my "crusade" tiresome, feel welcome to not bother reading or responding to my posts. Your welcome.  BTW: This is all relevant because there are a lot of NBA teams in trouble right now thanks to Stern's mistakes in the CBA. Milwaukee, Sacto, Memphis andNew Orleans are all relocation candidates. Charlotte, Clips, Minny, Miami, Toronto are a few others that are losing serious bank. If you think that people are going to stand for the crap that Stern and fatboy pulled again when the crap hits the fan then you will be surprised.
