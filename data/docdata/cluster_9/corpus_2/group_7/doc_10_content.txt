Has anyone asked someone from the Blazers if they have a legal issue they intend to dispute? I started a thread on this question and nobody can stay with this simple question. Everyone wants to give his legal opinions.    I thought the league would interpret the CBA in a way that would protect the Blazers, but it didn't happen that way.   And don't you think Miller's letter was a pretty big tell that the Blazers felt defeated by Miles appearing in that tenth game?    I was in a hurry earlier and didn't respond to this second sentence.  No, I think Miller's email was a legal notice to help build an appeal against the NBA. I also believe the Blazers attempt to claim Miles off waivers was done to strengthen their appeal against the NBA. I assume Miller, KP, and Penn are smart dudes and they calculated every known possibility and chose the best path after a studied analysis of all the options.  Edit: But, as always, I could be wrong.
