Anyone else remember the following bit of the show...?      It was a kind of data blast**  bit where you had to record it on VHS and then later on, play it back. You would have to pause and step through it page by page using the frame advance, otherwise it would advance too fast. Each frame (or every few frames) it would be a page of tips or other gaming related info. Quite innovative I thought, at least at the time it was            **(can't remember the exact name and CBA to step through the youtube vids to find it)
