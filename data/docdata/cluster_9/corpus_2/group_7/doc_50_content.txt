I don't really want to rain on anyone's parade, but I have to ask, have destro really had problem defending the Maw previously? I have the feeling that if order go for the Maw, we always get at least some sort of half-decent defence going, while it is many times harder to get people to defend Fell Landing or Butcher's Pass. Even the time order successfully took the Maw, we had a real defence up, it almost seems that many destro players take the Maw defence more serious than the other forts, maybe because it really is "at the gates of IC". On top of that you also have the people who have trouble finding the portals, don't know about them and can't get to fort from BC/Caledor WCs, etc, and just "cba" with it while the Maw is really easy and quick to get to.
