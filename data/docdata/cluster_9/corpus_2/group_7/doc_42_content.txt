Hello all,       Following Ned's announcement of getting a new camera, I decided to finally bite the bullet and get me that little pocketable camera I was always dreaming about. The Pana LX3 always looked very interesting to me (close to the same as Ned's Leica), but in the end I decided to opt for a little camera that offered an additional feature that the K20D doesn't offer. Plus I got a great deal on it after a discontented customer returned it to the shop. Turns out the camera was perfectly all right and she just didn't understand how it worked (shooting in Auto (high ISOs) at a dark party, not really where this camera shines).   Anyway, I like snorkelling from time to time when travelling around the world, so I ended up choosing Pentax again... the W60... Ocean blue colour so I don't scare the fishes too much... :-)   I'm charging the battery currently, so no pictures immediately but I'm looking forward to dropping it in the water soon... :-D  Wim      --   Belgium, GMT+1      Image control:  Zoom out     Zoom 100%     Zoom in     Expand / Contract     New window
