 we can talk all we want about manny or abreu or dunn or whomever, but it's not happening. this is our team going into spring training. it's basically the same team with k-rod replacing wagner (improvement, but not a huge improvement) and putz replacing heilman (who was good 2 years ago). why the mets FO is content with bringing back virtually the same team that collapsed 2 years in a row is beyond me, especially with a new ballpark and all.     You are 1000% correct! Same old team coming back, pen aside. Im stunned, after the 2 collapses and the new stadium factored in!!!   Arent they gonna make twice as much money with the new stadium? Whats Citibank paying them per year for naming rights?
