idk, the new CBA and salary cap increased is designed for teams to keep their own players, extend contracts to players they initially found in the first place via the draft, etc. Perhaps it's sort of a reward for finding that talent. It makes it harder and harder for other teams to sign top-notch FA's.  For right now, the team needs to focus their attention on guys like 2nd tier guys like Canty, Crowder (if Boss will be cut loose), Sean Jones, Bart Scott, and some good young CB's. I'm sure Derrick Ward will be a huge possibility as well.   The team's sort of in the crossroads w/ the Defense. I know they want that NT, but it's not for certain we'll be in range of Raji, or even Ron Brace in the 2nd round. Their aren't any bonafide NT's in FA, but some big bodies like Gabe Watson, KEnderick Allen, or Colin Cole. I'm interested to see how they go about it. It's this new regimes' first test.
