 No way. Never. The frontcourt is the weakest part of our team. This trade depletes not only our depth, but makes our backcourt even older.     Second, by the CBA rules, a team cannot trade a player, whothey recently traded for, in a multiplayer deal. That stupid trade machine won't tell you that.     The only possible way we acquire JRich would be straight up for Wally. The salaries match close enough and it falls within the boundaries of the CBA.    You'd think by now that trade machine would have been updated to include CBA restrictions. It would sure save people a lot of time and hassle proposing trades that are not even possible.
