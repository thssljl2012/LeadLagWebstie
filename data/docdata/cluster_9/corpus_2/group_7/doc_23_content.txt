 i saw a woman try to carry her puppy into bank of america and the security guard would not let her in so she left instead of just placing the dog in her car for 3 minutes. my neighbor has no children and is almost 60 years old and loves her papillon like it's her actual baby, but her bank (very small local one) lets her bring in her dog. i don't know if they allow all dogs or if they just allow hers because they know he is well behaved and small. i would never automatically assume it's ok to bring my dog in, but i would ask for future reference if i see someone else doing it and it appears to be ok.     on a side note, my god father visited ground zero a few years ago and he brought his dog with him (some type of shepherd, husky looking mix) and with all the people around, he held the dog on a very short leash and had dark sunglasses on because it was summertime. people automatically assumed it was a service animal and everyone stepped to the side to let him pass through to the front   he certainly didn't do it on purpose though.
