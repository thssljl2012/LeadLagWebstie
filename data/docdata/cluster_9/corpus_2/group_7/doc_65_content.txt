Loyalty works both ways and  the cap hinders the team owners . If you are already paying your loyal QB $20 million, OT $10 million, DE $15 million, WR $10 million, and CB $10 million what do you tell your star LB when he suddenly wants $12 million and you already have $65 miilionin salaries for 5 players and still have to field a team of 53 players with a $123 million cap You tag him for $7 million and start looking for a replacement.     The team owners that I worry about without a cap could destroy the sport. This could turn out like MLB where the deep pocket owners ( The George) buyall the talent and leave those with less little chance of competing.

At this point the players are becoming overly greedy       Could not agree more. Thats why having consistantly great teams today is a testament to the team management. The Pats, Steelers, Colts and a few other perenial playoff teams are outstanding front offices. I mean, I am not saying that we can compare them to the mighty Packers or Bears      Look at James Harrison...who I expect to be throwing the proverbial "**bleep** fit" By all means the Steelers could pay him. But why? DPY equals "Pay ME!" He is undoubtedly one of the top LBs in the biz if not the best. He's schedualed to make 1.4 mil this year...the final year of his contract. He WILL want renegotiated and has a valid point. However, he is 30 years old. If I were in the F.O. there is no way in heck I resign him long term. I force him to play out the final year of his contract...then next year tag him. Keep him two more years and pay him a total of maybe 10 mil. By this time, Timmons will be ready to step in for Farrior, Woodley is solid on the other side...and I have two more years to find and groom Harrison's eventual replacement. If Harrison somehow does continue to be a consistant force. I can always retag him, and still be saving enough $ to keep the team competitive.
