It has been stated by multiple sources that when the new CBA is reached in the summer of 2010, the salary cap is likely to be lower. 2.  Even though on the outside it looks like if LeBron waits he will still be able to get more money if he waits til 2010, crunch the numbers and you'll see that you're wrong. 3.  By signing an extension this summer, it is an insurance policy for LeBron, Wade, etc to ensure they will be making max dollars. 4.  While I don't always agree with Heath, he is correct in this instance. 5.  Wade was interviewed last night saying he might consider an extension this summer, just as LeBron did over a month ago.  If two of the most sought after F/A in 2010 are going on record saying that they will consider extensions a year early, that has to be SOME kind of indication that they believe signing an extension this summer will inevitably give them more money than if they held out for 2010.    your first part is wrong.  The current CBA runs through 2011.  THere is no compelling reason for LeBron and Wade to decide anything this summer.  At least from a CBA/financial standpoint.
