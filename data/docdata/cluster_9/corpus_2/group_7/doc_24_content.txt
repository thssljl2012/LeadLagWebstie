Honestly I am more upset that we are still talking about Heath and not focusing on what this subject is about&#058; Trade and Rumors. Lets deal with Heath on Thurs. Dont listen to him or just be smart and take what he says with a grain of salt. I am more focused on what Ferry thinks then Heath. To tell you the truth I am very entertained by Heath because I could care less what comes out his mouth is true or false because 99% of the stuff that comes out of people's mouths on this site is random. I'm still waiting for the guy who is going to say MJ was seen speaking to Lebron and is thinking about coming out of retirement til Delonte comes back..   We are on RealGM but truthfully chances are none of us are real general managers unless Heath is really Ferry and he likes to see the fire in his fans. But can we focus on trades and rumors(real or fake) until thursday. You have something to say about a trade or rumor post it. You dont like Heath, start another subject: Who wants to ban Heath?   Otherwise, I want to hear about Amare, Mike Miller, Caron Butler, Vince Carter, John Salmons, Brad Miller, Marcus Camby, etc. I dont want to hear about the projected cap, CBA, How much Lebron is going to make, or Heath and who banned him or if he is an insider unless those deadlines are all on thursday also.   Sorry for the rant but hopefully we can be more productive in the next 4 days than trying to go through the last 8 pages and getting a biography of Heath online and CBA rules.
