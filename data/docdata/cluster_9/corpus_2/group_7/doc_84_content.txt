There was an episode about the hunter guy who was accidentally shot by his own rifle.  He was in a deer stand and his rifle dropped, butt down, towards the ground and shot him!  He lost so much blood and was brain dead but recovered.  That was in Maple Plain, Minnesota.      And I think I already mentioned the John Gruendhofer kidnapping.  He was a US Bank executive who was kidnapped from the parking garage.
