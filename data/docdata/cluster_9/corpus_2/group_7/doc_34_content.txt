I feel, however, that Bibby is so full of himself that he will want big money and that will not be coming from Portland. It will also be tough to do two S &amp; T's in one deal.   One final thing; I do not think that Portland can include their $ 3 mil trade exception in this trade. It can only be dealt in for a single player at a time, up to the max of $3 mil. They could include it if Bibby signs for that amount, but we know he won't. Portland will be under the salary cap though, so trades like this should just point out they are using a portion of that cap space.     Firstly, what team is going to offer Bibby big money? The Hawks? Doubtful. Bibby won't be BYC as his contract won't be increasing, it'll be reduced by a considerable amount. Marv will probably be BYC but that isn't a concern for Portland.   Secondly, I stated in my original post that the TE would be created, not the one the Blazers already possess. This was not an attempt to mislead you, I just didn't think I'd have to spell it out for you. The Blazers get to keep their TE which can be a valuable asset when dealing with teams that are strapped for cash.      ecuhus1981 wrote: I'm not sure S&amp;Ts can be combined in this fashion.    Why not? There is no rule that states S&amp;Ts can not be combined in this "fashion". Generally it is very difficult to pull off, but this trade either matches salaries within the guidelines of the CBA, or would do with very minor tweaks.
