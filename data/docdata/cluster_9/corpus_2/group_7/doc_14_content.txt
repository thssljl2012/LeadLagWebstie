Big shot, big talking PatriotBlow has no mortgage, and is probably going to be one of the Obama check-a-month, where's my medical insurance? losers!!!!!!!!!          &gt;&gt;&gt;     I am just sitting here shaking my head. Some irrelevant soon to be unemployed bank employee (when you walk into a bank and see all those cubicles and offices on the perimeters and you see all those "employees" who don't do anything  - insert this guy), a professional perpetual student till his late 30's, who lives with his parents. To come on to a public message board and continually be exposed as a complete asshole, what a loser.        &gt;&gt;&gt;       You 2 are not only the whiniest little girls      with bloody tampons I've ever met, but      you've just shown how STUPID you are too!         I said the house was left to my late father.      late = dead       Don't you have a dictionary?      My parents have both passed on.      My father left the house to me.      I live there with my girlfriend, but I own it.      It's in my name.    I pay the property taxes.         And whiney girl sappho has no idea what I do      for a living (other than I said I work for Bank of America      &amp; I'm well acquainted with derivatives), so he makes      shit up.    Stupid &amp; whiney, what an ugly combination.         Jerry seems to understand the significance of where      I live in Falls River.     You two, it went right over your head!      LOL
