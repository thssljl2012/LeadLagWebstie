It's tucked back behind a couple larger historic apartment buildings I'm sure everyone has seen a thousand times.  It's actually a tiny apartment building itself.  On the side there is a door leading down to a pretty large basement/unit.      The second one (vine covered) is in north Encanto/Palmcroft, at 11th Ave/Encanto Blvd.      The third one (store fronts) is on Grand at Polk.      ForAteOh, you're right, that was from the U.S. Bank building, I was just dropping off a proposal at the Valley Metro offices, they were taken from the top of the garage portion.      Thanks all!
