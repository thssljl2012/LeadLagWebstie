                                              yeah i dont want to hear any complaning Jr had the right to take vickers out after what happened at dega a few years ago. if you dont remember get on youtube but vickers took Jr and Johnson out for the win. now thats somewhat understandable considering that was for the race and i expect the drivers to race hard at the end but to put a move like that on Jr just to block him from getting the lucky dog was just as irresponsible as jr taking him out. Vickers and Jr have had a rivalry going on for a long time just no one sees because no one ever sees Vickers up front. As for Kyle Busch getting so mad after the accident grow up you immatture peice of crap your team mate Joey Logano is more mature than you and he's 18 and he wrecked also and it showed during the post acciddent interview that he is already more mature than you and thats why you get booed more than Jeff Gordon now because all the fans hate you as well. im a Jeff Gordon fan myself and i have been since 1996 and its about time someone is hated more than Gordon i went to the Bank of America 500 at Lowes last october and it was the first time ive ever heard the crowd boo somebody more than Gordon its pretty damn funny i think.
