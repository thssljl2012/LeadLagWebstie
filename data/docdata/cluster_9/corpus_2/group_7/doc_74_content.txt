             A new CBA with a salary cap structure like they have now is not going to stop good players from leaving their teams either. Loyalty works both ways and the cap hinders the team owners. If you are already paying your loyal QB $20 million, OT $10 million, DE $15 million, WR $10 million, and CB $10 million what do you tell your star LB when he suddenly wants $12 million and you already have $65 miilionin salaries for 5 players and still have to field a team of 53 players with a $123 million cap You tag him for $7 million and start looking for a replacement.
