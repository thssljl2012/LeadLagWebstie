 First off I just have to say thanks for all the responses, its great to get some real perspective from people who actually live in the city rather than people who just visited.

In columbus i would say you can get from the burbs to downtown in rush  hour in like 45 minutes...

In addition, they made the arena the centerpiece of a massive downtown muti-purpose development, similar in many ways to the Railyards problem Sacramento is trying to fix today:                      are there any plans to make a new development in sacramento similar to arena district?? and speaking of arena district i love the blue jackets and would love to catch a game when they play in the shark tank (san jose). would it be practical to drive to san jose and back home for a game or would i have to plan on staying in san jose
