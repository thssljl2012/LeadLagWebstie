The question really is what are the restructing rules after 2009?                      From the CBA      No NFL Player Contract entered into in a Capped Year and extending into the Final League Year or   beyond may provide for an annual increase in Salary, excluding any amount attributable to a signing bonus as   defined in Section 7(b)(iv) above, of more than 30% of the Salary provided for in the Final Capped Year, per   year, either in the Final League Year or in any subsequent League Year covered by the Player Contract. For   example, without limitation on any other applicable example, a four-year Player Contract signed in the 2011   League Year, assuming that it is Capped, may not provide for an annual increase of more than 30% of the 2011   League Year Salary, excluding amounts treated as a signing bonus, in any of the three additional League Years   covered by the Contract.
