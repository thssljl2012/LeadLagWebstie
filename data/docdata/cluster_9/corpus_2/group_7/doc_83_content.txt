I believe the CBA sets a max salary reduction of 20%, though.                            Mark Loretta made $3.5 Mil in 2007, went to arbitration with the Astros.  Astros submitted $2,750,000; Loretta submitted $4,900,000.  Club won, salary will be lower for 2008 than for 2007.       http://www.bizofbaseball.com/index....inion&amp;Itemid=41
