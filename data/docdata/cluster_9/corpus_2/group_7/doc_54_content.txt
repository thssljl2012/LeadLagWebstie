If what you say is accurate, then I reiterate my notion that KP may be doing some major maneuvers on draft day. The Draft is 3 days before the deadline for guaranteeing those contracts of Blake and Outlaw, so it's possible they could be viewed the same way as cap-space. Trade them to a team, and the other team doesn't guarantee their contracts. Sounds too easy...there's got to be a catch    Hey, I'm not being a jerk!  It's just... what makes sense to you could be confusing somebody who doesn't know the terminology at all.  You know as much or more about the CBA as I do.  And while that scenario does sound weird, I think it could happen like that.  I've been epically wrong about the CBA here before, though.
