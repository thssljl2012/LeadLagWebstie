Not surprising because you have been wrong about everything in this thread.  It is one thing to just talk out of your ass that isn't special.  But how do you get almost every single point backwards, it is actually amazing.    http://hoopshype.com/rumors.htm      Unless he is traded to another team (NOT), then he wont have Bird rights with another team.  As far as the Cavaliers go, I already said that his contract would remain the same if he re-signed with us in the summer of 2010...  However, if the CBA changes, and he lets his contract run out, then it makes no sense to not sign an extension...  That was the whole point!!!  LeBron and Wade are GUARANTEED to sign extensions...  Chris Bosh may wait it out, and see what Toronto does, and possibly force a trade.
