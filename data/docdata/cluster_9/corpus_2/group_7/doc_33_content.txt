The big problem with invalidating contracts is that it might not actually be possible because many contracts would have a bigger cap hit by being invalidated. I remember an article regarding the Redskins that said had the new CBA not been signed, their was no mathematical way for them to get under the cap regardless of which or how many contracts were invalidated.                      I couldn't find anything in the CBA regarding it.  I know new contracts may not be approved, but I couldn't find anything regarding existing contracts if a team is over the cap at the beginning of the year.  I know I've heard about it, but I just couldn't find anything after my (albeit brief) search.  If you can, please point me in the right direction.
