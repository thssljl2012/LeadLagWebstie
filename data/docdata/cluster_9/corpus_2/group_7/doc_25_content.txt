Do you have a crystal ball that tells you where the Isles will finish in the standings and that Bailey and Petrov are going to be good players. No matter how you try to spin it, the Isles are in far worse trouble. They are losing money, have a horrid arena, a goalie that is hurt and is signed for another 8 years (not to mention they're paying for Yashin for the next 4 years or so). The Isles are GIVING away tickets. No one cares. They really are the laughing stock of the league.     The only reason they are loosing money is because of a stupid CBA rule which doesn't allow teams in a market with more then 2.5 million homes to get it. It was in the post by Larry Brooks.
