In fact, i think in this case RL beats any game                        Jeez stop with the winks, it makes me want to track you down and /slap you  .    Stop saying LOTRO isn't the game for me. I want to play in Middle Earth, nowhere else. If I couldn't play in Middle Earth I'd not be playing MMOs at all, I'd go play Morrowind or Oblivion or Football Manager or Civilisation.    I cba multi-quoting your multi-quote reply tbh. All I can tell you is that when I read that I'd need to work out 6 instances, get gear from those for the whole kin and only then go work out and down the Watcher, I cheered. At last, something difficult and time-consuming and a kin-wide project. And so it turned out. I love it. A raid with as much content as the 6 instances plus Watcher would be at least as large as the Rift, probably larger. I'd rather that effort be spread out as it is rather than all bundled into one multi-lock instance.    (I should add that I have concerns about the way it was implemented - hard mode as it stands encourages skipping content and exploiting, but that's about detail, not principle.)
