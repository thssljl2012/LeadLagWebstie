That leaves New England as the only team not seriously making waves with regard to a stadium. All of those new stadiums means a lot more revenue for the teams and for the league.       The CBA negotiations will be taking place this year. Even though the CBA does not directly affect the salary cap, that is going to be the biggest thing everyone is going to be talked about. New York is going to be among those pushing for $5 million, but we can't expect Garber and co. to budge that much. $3.5 mil is certainly a possibility.       If they make the salary cap, basically 150% of what it is now with bigger increases, and tons more revenue with so many revenue-controlled stadiums (Qwest and FIU for a possible Miami stadium), as well as an ever-expanding league, those "funds" are coming.                      While NE's situation stinks they still don't lose a ton of money. It's sad but that's the only silver lining.      With regards to DC's stadium in MD? Don't assume anything being close or near to being done there. That would be a bad assumption. You got KC, Philly and Houston looks good at this point. SJ? Who knows at this point. Lew's great but this process better be over before he kicks the bucket. I'll believe it when I see it. Cali is in bad shape and I can see this thing getting pushed further and further back.      Still, in this environment the news is pretty positive for the most part.      The cap will be raised and there will be the ability to retain, add a couple of more above average players to widen the gap a bit. Will it be a huge. No, but it will be another step in the process of making it bigger. As you said, even if MLS moves it to 3.5 (feasible), you can add some decent quality.      Note - DC is now the leagues biggest issue money wise. If the MD sitaution gets bogged down, and there are already plenty of forces at work trying to make this happen, then I just can't see McF hanging around anymore. He's really put in time/effort/cash and eventually enoughs gonna be enough.
