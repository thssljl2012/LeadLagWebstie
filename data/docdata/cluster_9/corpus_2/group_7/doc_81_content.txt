I agian honestly cba about lower levels what i do care is the chance to enjoy the game in its fullest which require a population thats atleast med/med                      You do realise that the low/low refers to all four tiers? (what happened to med/med last week btw? Was everyone away at half-term?) From the censuses, it seems clear that at least one third of all characters logged in at primetime are T4, if not half. Weeknights it was roughly 150-200 a side. Which is a potential eight warbands for each side, although more often around three or four.       Not sure why you want to destroy Burlok but that seems to be what you're trying to do by your constant stream of negativity.
