I drove several times up and down Denny and I saw nothing.                      I found parking in front of that Indian restaurant, but I dont think this is a good location.  If we are married to the Capitol Hill area, we should meet at the Stabucks on Olive (I think) a few blocks from there.  Its a major one in an easy to find location.
