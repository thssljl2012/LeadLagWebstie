Also, when we hit that 10% chance at a top-3 pick, sign a legit 2 guard for the MLE and beef up the bench with Delfino and Rasho, Bosh may want to stick around to see what happens, and that's exactly what BC will ask him to do.   If next year we're back in the playoffs, Bosh will stay.      Always remember what happened with VC.  He signed with us for more money.  Then we drafted a stud big man in 2003.  But then VC decided he couldn't wait for Bosh to develop and "demanded a trade".     That will be fixed i n the next CBA, I expect shorter contracts, incentives and partial guarantees on contracts will prevent players from forcing owners hands and act like spoiled rotten primadonnas.
