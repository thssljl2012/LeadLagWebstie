 I can think of 2 little holes in the wall off 316 on 120, if you turn left there is the "Jerk Shack" just past Aldi's. If you turn right there is a place on the left just past the bank of america and a chinese buffet in a little office plaza. Both are good, but I like the place next to BOA better, the chef's palate is more refined. The Jerk Shack is more of a jamaican fast food type. The owners at both are very personable.   There is also a columbian place in the same plaza on the backside. I've eaten there once, it was ok, but I asked for a lemon for my tea and got a bowl of lime wedges and &#036;2 added to my check.
