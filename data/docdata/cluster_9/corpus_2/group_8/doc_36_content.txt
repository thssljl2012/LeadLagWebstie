 the minute you finish your application the test should be available, i don't know if the GPA you put in affects this but i was given the test straight away with 2 days to complete it.   Its a pre visor one, difficulty wise i would say easier than most but because of the time issue it can be challenging. I missed out on 3 questions or 4 can't remeber. After you do the combined maths/verbal/shape test theres an personality test, followed by a "what makes a good supervisor test".   If you killed the Westpac test, then this is no issue to you.
