 "when you get that link, can you look into whether or not arbitrated salaries are 'guaranteed'?"  The only place arbitration 'rules' are set out is in the CBA, which can be probably be found online. From what I can tell, it looks like the only figure an arbitration panel decides between is salary and an uniform players contract(I.E. no deferrals, guaranteed salary etc.) is then issued.
