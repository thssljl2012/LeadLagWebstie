      Sorry; busy morning for insurance folk with all the AIG developments....yes, Dilick is keeping power/water on until the 15th and is giving residents who apply &#036;500 to help with moving expenses.  One elderly woman who has to move to West Virginia may also get help with her plane ticket.   Bit late for visits from Christmas ghosts, but good for whatever inspired this sudden sympathy.  Had a chance on Sunday to see some of the other abandoned apartments.  Several of the fold-out ironing boards still intact in the kitchens - they have swivel mechanisms so one can move it from side to side as well as up &amp; down.  The larger apartments have a living room and dining room separated by a waist-high room divider with cabinets &amp; shelves.  Closets in one bedroom have a built-in chest of drawers - looks like an update since the closet doors are overhead hung and sliding.  If there had been a hallway, they would be almost the same size as the duplex I grew up in.  Different color schemes for the bathroom tile by apartment building.  So does one laugh or cry about the colossal waste?  Through the collapsed ceilings the attic is visible and is indeed a Texas basement - enough roof area to stand up in.  Imagine if the place had been kept up - what would the going price be for a 2 bedroom apartment/condo with living room, dining room, 2 entrances and a loft 3rd room; perhaps a half bath as well?  So much potential winding up in a landfill.  All those neat back doors with the screen and the little door at the top, the gorgeous blonde brick that looks showroom pristine, the recessed gas fireplaces in the living rooms, the oak floors, the telephone nooks, the vintage gas stoves with the warmer/pot storage next to the oven, the Deco light fixtures by the back doors, the graceful curved stair railings, the accent walls of glass bricks - all trash....
