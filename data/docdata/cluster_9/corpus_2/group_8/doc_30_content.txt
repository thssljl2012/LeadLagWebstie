Thanks SS!      The Gardens are definitely on the itinerary. I got some good suggestions from some of the lads on Board Game Geek as well...       We'll be taking the Victoria Clipper from Seattle, so we won't have a car, but a lot of the stuff looks like it's within walking distance from the hotel.       Here's an odd question. If you have an debit card from a US bank, can you use it to get cash back in Canada (Canadian dollars)? Just curious. It's been years since I've been to Canada and I think I just used my credit card for everything last time.
