My WC3 decided to crash when i was watching this some days ago, just when KS.int was turning it around and I still cba to watch it again.  I seriously didn't believe they would get out of it this time, but amazingly they did. That PoTM was rediciculously stacked because of getting almost all the kills when the gangraped early - mid game.    That Blink + Roll dodge on the ES Echoslam gank was priceless. Easily moment of the week potential.    Edit: OK, didn't see the Blink Roll dodge this game.. maybe I'm confusing something. Nvm. Never saw the end of this game on the second try either, Storm seems to crash the game on when running on Wine ~_~. At least I got to 1H20 this time.  Quite many Khaz Modan fans in this game though. New metagame = Dagger BKB?
