Dash thinks "The team is 2 - 0 up and the odds are 1.33 and a 1.04 lay?"  Backed .. before I laid it occured to me .. what is a 0 handicap inplay bet?    Hopped on to live chat .. bet us finishing score minus current score. Draws are refunded.    Backed the opposite outcome for either a 5 loss .. or a 35 loss depending what occured .. the final 3rd finished  2 -2 .. overall 4 -2 .. bets refunded.    Handicap betting is difficult to lay in play is my guess
