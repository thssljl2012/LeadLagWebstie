 1. I meter in manual with the green button then fire the flash at 1/2 power .  When I do this I will underexpose a bit - so if pressing the green button comes up with f8 at 3 sec I would cut that to 2 sec.   Some German tourist bumped into me and I smashed my flash but it was worth it to use it.   2. By wider zoom I mean wider than 18-xx.  Either of the 16-xxs would work.          rondeann wrote:     &gt; Thanks for the response.  I have two questions.   &gt; 1.  When you say, 'I used a afgz 360 to illuminate the foreground in   &gt; some shots while still metering as if I did not use flash', do you   &gt; mean you metered with the flash turned off then set those values into   &gt; the camera in manual mode and turned the flash on?   &gt; 2. When you say bring a 'wider zoom' do you mean wider than the 10-20   &gt; or did you mean to say longer zoom (16-45 or 16-50)?   &gt; amicah22 wrote:     &gt; &gt; A 16-45 or 16-50 would of been ok as my wife did well with the 24mm   &gt; &gt; on the lx3 (24-60) but a zoom is necessary for framing.  I would of   &gt; &gt; been frustrated with the da 14 or the new 15mm pancake I think.   I   &gt; &gt; used a afgz 360 to illuminate the foreground in some shots while   &gt; &gt; still metering as if I did not use flash - that one way to deal with   &gt; &gt; the 12+ stops of dr in the slots.   Thanks for the compliment, you   &gt; &gt; should check it out - just bring a decent tripod and a wider zoom and   &gt; &gt; your good to go.   &gt; &gt; rondeann wrote:   &gt; &gt; &gt; Those are such great shots they made me decide to visit a slot   &gt; &gt; &gt; canyon.  Could you make suggestions of what equipment you think I   &gt; &gt; &gt; would find useful.  For example I assume a tripod is a must and did   &gt; &gt; &gt; you find the 10-20mm lens was adequate?   &gt; &gt; &gt; --   &gt; &gt; &gt; You pay for what you get but you don't necessarily get what you pay for   &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; --   &gt; &gt; Aaron W.   &gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt;    Image control:  Zoom out     Zoom 100%     Zoom in     Expand / Contract     New window           &gt;      &gt; --   &gt; You pay for what you get but you don't necessarily get what you pay for         --   Aaron W.
