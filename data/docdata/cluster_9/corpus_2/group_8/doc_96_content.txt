I think before UOP stadium, they were always on the low end of NFL cash flow, but since UoP, they been in the top 10. I think in the last 2 years they have had to send money to the NFL fund instead of receive.     The dynamics of the rich vs poor NFL teams is all going to be redone in the next CBA.                      Really?!  I did not know that.  Why wouldnt the Cards get to keep everything, they earned the home playoff game?
