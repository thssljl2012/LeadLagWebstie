Oh now I get it, well every server needs more Order so that's no suprise. I play/played a 40 Engineer on Karak-Azgal and now it's time for me to try the Choppa, what I wanted to play from the beginning. I cba to delete my 40 Engineer only to reroll Destruction on that server since I already rerolled Engineer by deleting my rank 38 Black Orc on the very same server not that long ago.    And I choose this server mainly because I've heard it's a good one with alot of nice guilds.    In the end, all I wanted was to say hello to everyone, not tell my whole Warhammer-life story. If someone could name a couple of good small scale RvR guilds I'd be more than happy.
