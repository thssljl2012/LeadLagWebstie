Don't resign Sundin and 6 for JayBo and the remainder for Ohlund 5.7mil, why not, its not like the Canucks or any other team has to worry about the cap going down, if it does then the salaries automatically go down by a similar proportion, ie: cap down 10%, salaries down 10% its in the CBA.    Then package Bieska, Raymond and Grabner or Hogdson(?) together for Kovalchuk.
