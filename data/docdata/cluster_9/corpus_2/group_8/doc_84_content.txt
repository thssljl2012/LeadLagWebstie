     Our Ladies Tennis team won and gave us another point and we lead 8 - 4 and just need two more points to win the competition.  Unfortunately most of the remaining points I feel will go to the Aggies.  We have no more events in March.  I am hoping we can get the points in Men's tennis and Men's Golf.  I feel we have an even chance in the baseball but it would be nice to get those ten points in the Men's tennis and golf.  We will see.  FWHORN I think we are going to win it this year but it will still be tough.
