            i didn't bother with Simmons article since there was an article about pretty much the same thing in the NYTimes about David Falk (Jordon's agent) and his assessment that the NBA was in serious trouble and that the owners might shut it down after this CBA is up in 2011.    I wonder if Bill Simmons read that article...it was on Monday.
