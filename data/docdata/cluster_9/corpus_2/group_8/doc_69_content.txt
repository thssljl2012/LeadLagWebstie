Here is what was said                  Quote:           During a conference call, Panthers GM Marty Hurney is stressing the notion that they're waiting for franchise-tagged DE Julius Peppers to solicit offers, and if anyone wants to pony up the two first-round picks required under the CBA, they're willing to consider matching or not.              Link         Note that Hurney never mentioned wanting anything for Peppers. He is only stating the obvious-that if someone did try and sign Peppers to an offer sheet (which would require us receiving 2 1sts as compensation, that they would consider it) Hurney DOES NOT say anything about requiring two first rounders, all he says is that they aren't going to actively shop Peppers and will only consider a deal if another team approaches them first.        I know this seems confusing because darin gantt stupidly put a misleading title, but anyone who actually reads the quote will see that Hurney says nothing about how much the team wants for Peppers.        Anyways, as for a NE possibility, I would gladly ship Pep to them now that Cassel is not an option. Two of their 3 2nd rounders are fine with me-if that's what their offering let's take it and move on.         (or even better, throw in Ken Lucas and add in either an extra pick or bump up one of the picks to the 23rd overall. Moving those two would allow the Panthers to actually make some moves in FA and help soften the departures we've had so far in FA) _________________        Carolina Panthers-the official killers of your dream offseason. At least Pep is still available...
