      Yeah, I thought that was weird, too...maybe it's some kind of CBA agreement concession...a NHL contractee in the minors can't be traded unless he's on the NHL roster...maybe he gets to collect an NHL per diem at his contract rate before being sent to another minor league affiliate.  I don't know, man, I'm talking out of my a**, here.
