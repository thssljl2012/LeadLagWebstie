                                                                   The thing that annoys me with Dreger is how he rarely if ever uses the terms like NHL, NHLPA, CBA, etc.. He always refers to things with their full name.     "I have had many discussions with players around the National Hockey League..."      "The National Hockey League Players Association will not reopen the Collective Bargaining Agreement..."      "When it comes to fighting in hockey, the National Hockey League, as well as, the National Hockey League Players Association..."
