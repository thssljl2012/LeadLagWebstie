Geez you cant commit to the OTA's to get paid 8.5 million ?He must have too much money. Its too bad as he would have benifited hinself and the Redskins playing on the same line as Albert,I bet the other teams in the NFC east are pleased.      I think the guys like Favre ,Taylor etc are going to be the last of the prima donna type guys not showing up for the OTA's as teams having to commit top dollars to players are going to require their attendance in the OTA's from here on out. You cant blame the teams for doing it because last year Taylor didnt do it , he got hurt and the Skins lost a top paid player that was counted on to perform. The teams will want to oversee players offseason workout programs to make sure they stay in top physical condition. The teams are putting more clauses in the contracts regarding pay tied to these workouts so these OTA's that are not mandatory per the CBA are to be attended if they want full pay (another words it will be a incentive related to bonus money not salary) Remember Clit Hunt would never show up fpr these and lose out on six figures every year to stay at home and party and we know what type of motivation he had as a player.
