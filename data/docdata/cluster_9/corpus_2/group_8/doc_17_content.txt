I must be getting old, it just seems a bit  wrong  to me when I think about it, deserted motorway perhaps excepted. Over 120 ish is getting a bit piss take. I know that seems to contradict some other posts, but there's riding fast and there's  riding fast .     Can't believe I'm typing that, but I am. Pass me some slippers       Edit - Perhaps I'm just falling into the trap of tutting at anyone who goes faster than I do.
