 I want to apologize to all of you who have written on my wall over the last year.  I didn't get how the thing worked and tried to answer a couple  long ago, but didn't think the messages went.  Today, I forgot the market was closed and had a new buddy request, so I read all the messages.  I am so sorry. It seems like every time I get on here, something is changed and I don't have the time to figure it out. So, if you wrote on my wall, I didn't mean to ignore the message. Barb, you ask if you had offended me - by all means NEVER!! I have often said that I am so oblivious that I wouldn't know if someone had offended me, unless they slapped me across the face.  I respect everyone's right to have their own opinions and whether I agree or disagree, doesn't affect my respect for them as a person.  Maybe I am just slow. . . . .!   LOL  Anyway, I pretty much agree with everyone on LNC, and I admire those of you who are so outspoken.    I dumped all my stock, so tomorrow I will have to buy some new ones, if I have any money left!  I read that Avon was good, also Bank of America. What do you all think?????
