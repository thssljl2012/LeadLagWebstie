I would say this would make sense if we aquired Jay Williams - but we didn't. He's still rehabbing....    But regardless - we're going to suck this year. This is just one less distraction in our locker room.     The game is really taking on the CBA and European style slowly - more and more europeans playing.  So maybe this guy can help us a bit with his style as he's played overseas.
