They're the presumed landing spot for Curry, but maybe they'd be willing to part with some mid-round compensation in order to assure it?   I'm all for building up anyone as a consensus pick, if only because it could make that #1 worth something to someone.     Whenever the CBA gets renegotiated, I think the NFLPA has to agree to something like the NBA has with rookie contracts.   It's counterproductive for the #1 overall pick in the NFL draft to be the most untradeable one in sports.         Why on earth would they give up the extra guaranteed money to get a guy they could wait on?
