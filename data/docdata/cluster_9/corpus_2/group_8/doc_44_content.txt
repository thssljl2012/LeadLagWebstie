I'm not an administrator and why do you think I'm whinging?? Just giving my humble opinion. I have a long successful history with basketball at seabl/cba/aba as a player with different clubs and more recently coach and have a track record of being succesfull putting my money where my mouth is.  However to be fair, if we were talking about cba in Sydney from the 1990's or even seabl now I would't be advocating such an egalitarian approach, although would always support development of local juniors. But Waratah does not benefit from having artificially stacked teams and those players do not benefit in terms of exposure or prestige or whatever from playing in (win or not) a stacked Waratah team. And I accept it is no longer really a development league!  Again just my opinion. And it's just timing that we are talking about these specific guys, nothing against them personally.  But good luck to all Waratah teams...really. There is strong recent evidence that a 'stacked' team does necessarily bring championships so I'm not sure that anything is a guarantee.
