Pothier clearing medical tied GMGM's hands.  He couldn't do anything.  I don't doubt he looked all day to see if could move Nylander.  This again, not GMGM's fault.   GMGM made the decisions that had to be made at the time with Pothier and Nylander, it is now out of his hands.     actually Pothier being cleared was exactly why he should have made a deal.      What deal, and with what cap space?      Pothier still isn't counting against the cap.  And when he starts to, you waive him and keep him in Hershey for good.       Can you waive a guy who has just come off of LTIR?  I thought those guys had to be reintegrated into the roster once they've come off of LTIR.  Maybe I'm wrong, I've still never found the time to really study the CBA.
