You would not believe how many times I have seen somebody "flash out" another car and then plough straight into them!      Just because something is common practice it does not make it right, that said, like everybody else, from time to time I do it myself also.                        Really? i was always told i could go on other peoples signals but not signal others, again you have to use some common sense you wont pull out in front of a car doing 40 if he is flashing his lights, but if you can see him slowing down you might.   Examiners tend to wear high vis jackets.      Yeah, there are a fair share of idiots on the road and i treat anyone as such and i've not had too many surprises.      Either way i don't find myself flashing many people out especially learners.
