I just thought it was kind of rude to say something like that where others, especially guests, could hear what she was saying.       Opinions?                            Funny - but innapropriate.      When I was a manager at a theater I had a clerk who just couldn't shut her mouth - always talking about TMI issues whne customers were around and getting into debates. I wrote her up several times and then I fired her when she started talking to a customer about the benifits of doucheing while she was ringing up her order for Twizzlers     Some people just have no sense.                                                 __________________        Very Good, Sponge ... now you have to actually study for your ACT this time - last year you "studied" but you didn't really "study" you know
