                         Jack, clean up the language a bit, please. I know that sounds lame after all that's been going on here today and last night, but humor me on this one. It's probably all the moderation I'll do until everybody runs out of spitballs.             -jdtippett   My apologies, JD. I don't mean to offend your delicate sensibilities. I do get a bit fired up about this :) And frankly, Lee deserves it.   He is doing the same thing that the CAVE people do: Attack the person, not the substance.  Attack Allison.... without knowing anything about the programs she's involved in.  If you want to talk policy, I can do that ALL DAY. But I don't truck with this 'politics of personality' BS that both sides seem to be engaging in.  I just expect more from Lee.  He's a smart guy, he should know better than just copy/paste something as biased and uninformed as Fitts.
