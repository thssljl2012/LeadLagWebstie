suicide right, yet they have gordon at the 2 long term so getting harden does what puts on of them on the bench.  He wont be playing point guard any time soon with either Baron or Jose their long term.  So again i dont see it, in todays economy with the cap going down and a new CBA in 2011 having Barons contract vs Joses is financial suicide for a guy whos 30 already.  The pick is also about 2 million less expensive so thats an added bonus for the clippers.  Two young big men+Jose+the 8th pick for Baron+harden.  I think its more than fair.  Raptors have to win in order for bosh to stay so i think paying the tax wouldnt hurt them.  Also Harden might not even go 2nd,   1st- Griffen (Kings) 2nd-Rubio(Wizards) 3rd Thabeet(Thunder) 4th Harden(Clippers)  i post this because i think thats likely what would happen, wizards could use harden but need a good point guard and could move gilbert to SG and Butler play PF.  Thunder need size not gaurds so they draft thabeet.  So i think a deal like this would work, moving from 4 to 8 isnt that big of a jump.    Jennings, Teague, Curry, Henderson, Monroe all good prospects at 8 just dont fit the bill for the raptos at SG.  Clippers have Gordon so Harden wouldnt really work.  As i said they trade Thorton+Camby for Jefferson+CV  Calderon/Jennings Gordon/Collins Jefferson/Davis Randolph/CV/Hump Kaman/Jordan/Obyrant  +MLE player which would be a guard/small forward and that team is playoff bound so i think its more than fair, they need to move camby+thorton or one of their bigs for an upgrade so im throwing that idea out there because jefferson is a 2011 expiring along with randolph and cv is a good big off the bench
