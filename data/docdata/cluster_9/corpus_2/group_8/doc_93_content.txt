 Hi Emma            I was to India a year ago travelling with my sister. We felt travelling in India by train was very safe. In Shatdabi train AC classes virtually all people are Westerners if that matters (you can buy the tickets online to that train with the instructions you find here in Tripadvisor - if I remember correctly I had to use Citibank link to be able to pay with my Diners, as Visa did not work there..).             What can be scary are both Delhi and  Agra  railway stations. Delhi railway station if you arrive there early in the morning like we did when it was still dark. Lots of people were immediately around our taxi, trying to carry our bags. We just told them to go away, pushed them away as we would carry them ourselves. The locals kindly adviced us to the right track - after which we encountered a scam when the local man wanted to see our train tickets (e-tickets). He then told us the tickets were not valid as they were not stamped. Took us to the "office" that was apparently no part of official railway company. By then we started to be so much awake that we understood it was a scam. Had some kind of polite and non-polite discussions with two men who continued to tell the tickets are not valid, they can make them valid with some extra money and we told we just take the risk of non-vaild tickets (as I knew they were valid - I read the instructions of Indian Railways to them, as I had printed them out should the conductor in the train ask some extra proof. They told us to go and I hope that day their scam was not succesful to anyone else either! The ticket has to be shown only in the train to the conductor, not to anyone else who is asking it before.            At Agra railway station there were lots of touts who pushed around tried to get you their car. One tout (driver?) kind of chose us and as he was rather aggressive we were not too happy with that. However, we ended up to accept his car after we had prebooked tickets. He tried to get his"friend" to the car as well, we told we only want one driver and the other one was away immediately. NEVER accept anyone else but your driver into your taxi if you travel alone in India.             Take taxi (or private car and driver) everywhere in Agra, as otherwise you get no peace as a woman.If you go back to Delhi railway station, arrange a private car to pick you up or if not, use prepaid taxes at least. Deepa is absolutely right, it may not be safe to walk around alone when it gets dark - it is also scary, I would never have even tried. We either stayed at the hotel or used the drivers arranged by our hotel - lovely drivers I would say. They took very good care of us and we learnt a lot about India from them.            Taj Mahal is well worth visiting. I loved it in the mirning when there were very few people. In that sense I would recommend you to travel to Agra at daytime, stay there overnight, ask your hotel to arrange you transfer to Taj Mahal and then back to hotel or railway station.            Have a good time in India. It is the incredible country.            MaijaH
