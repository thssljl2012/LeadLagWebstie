Unfortunatly to Brian  , I didn't post the regional map w/the current "official" Unemployment figures.  HOwever I thought it was pretty interesting to see the jump in every county.      But to get back to your question, heck yeah...it would be a good idea so we don't have to keep wasting bandwith w/threads like "are nursing jobs plentiful in Charlotte?".....umm, NO jobs are plentiful here right now.
