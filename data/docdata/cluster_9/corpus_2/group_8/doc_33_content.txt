I'm a 34 yr old male from Altadena, California.   I love anything to do with the outdoors, I fish, hunt and camp. (I eat what I kill)   I am fascianted with the paranormal and have experiencied a few things in my life that I would like to get some answers about.   I work for Bank of America going on 12 yrs now. (hopefully I can hold on)
