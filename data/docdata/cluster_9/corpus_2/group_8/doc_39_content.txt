I know a lot of people still make regular trips to the bank, but I honestly think brick and stone banks are on the way out. I see no need for them anymore with everything being electronic today. Face to face went out with western movies...    In 20 or 30 years, when today's kids are doing the banking, there won't be any. All of us old coots from yesteryear will be gone and everyting will be done electronly. All you need is a small branch at the grocery story to sign up, and never se a bank again.    They have the technology now, but are waiting for the old timers to be planted...    Just like the automobile, they have perfected "Drive by wire" for cars. You steer with a joy stick and no steering wheel. It's available now, but you won't see it on production cars until the younger generation who were raised with joy sticks take over as the buying public...    Trying to get grampa to drive with a joy stick would be like getting everyone to use nothing but electronic banking today.... The public isn't yet ready for it, but be assured, it's coming...
