                     Multiculturalism forced down your throat at work, literally, March 16-22                                             It's only ever about the food, the food the food.  Never the Aussies forced out of their jobs, the unemployment, the gangs, the violence, the rapes, the imported anti-white racism, the increasing pressure placed on our housing and scarce resources caused by mass third world immigration.  No, this is all made up for by the  food , you get it?     So next time an Aussie gets his head kicked repeatedly against a brick wall at a train station , when he comes to he should just remember how he has been enriched by that hip little African cafe around the corner that hard working, law abiding refugees have set up.    For once, for this week, it would be a good excuse to go down the road to Maccas or something and just boycott this propaganda being forced into the workplace.      Introducing A Taste of Harmony           Quote:                         A Taste of Harmony is about recognising and celebrating the rich cultural diversity that exists in Australian workplaces. And what better way to do it than through food!    A Taste of Harmony is an inaugural event supported by The Scanlon Foundation, which will take place during the week of 16 March - 22 March 2009. The week coincides with National Harmony Day, which is held on 21 March.    The vision is for all workplaces - big or small - to participate by gathering colleagues together over a delicious lunch made up of foods from different lands, either at their workplace or at a participating restaurant.    So get involved in A Taste of Harmony and help celebrate our cultural diversity in the most delicious way!
