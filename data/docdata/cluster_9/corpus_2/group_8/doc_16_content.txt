  quote:   ORIGINAL:  Temp0      Why are the English more concerned with St Patricks day than St Georges day? We need to fix up and make a big thing of it.          Completely agree with ya, St George's Day should be a bank holiday over here!!      I celebrate Paddies day simply cos my whole family are Irish.
