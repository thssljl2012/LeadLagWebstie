I don't think that Bosh has any say as to where he can be traded.  I think that BC can seek trades for Bosh without it becoming public because everyone is already going to be thinking he is shopping Bosh until he resigns or next years trade deadline.  And as we have discussed, yes we could probably get Bosh to stay by offering him the most money, that will probably not happen because it would handcuff us when the new CBA is signed.  We really have no advantage to signing Bosh than anyone else who has cap space in 2010.  I just can't see BC offering him the max.
