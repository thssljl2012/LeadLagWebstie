 the car will be staying standard, wont be having any engine swaps, only thing i want to change is the gearbox, or atleast the 5th gear and make it a bit longer, cba with spending loads of money on cars now, ill be moving soon anyway so will need somting a bit cheaper to run about in    i went to Grimbsy to go and see the mrs folks for a few days and got back yesturday, 560 mile round trip, good first test dive for it i suppose
