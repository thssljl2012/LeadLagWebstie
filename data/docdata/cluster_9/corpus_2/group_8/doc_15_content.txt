 Hey guys! I'm new to this forum, having just bought my first Terri an AWD 2004 TX. Which i must say am very happy with!     However, reading this post it has me a bit worried(me and the missues have a baby on the way) about the lower ball joints. What are the first symtoms of wear etc? (Is there noise, vibration?)   My Terri has just done 84,000km and it was an Ex-Lease car from ANZ bank up in Mackay, so it has had all it's scheduled servicing.   Is there anyway i can tell if they have already been replaced?      Cheers, for your help.
