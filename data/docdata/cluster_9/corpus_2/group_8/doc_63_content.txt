     No Cornerbacks    this year for Bill  10 LB's 5DL's.... and    VINCE    at NT = 6 2 Safeties..... Rodney and Brandon .... That's it  18Defensive players on the Roster  Bill's out to prove somethin' ! Everyone's switching to *his* 3-4 Defense. So.... time for a change. All the existing CB's are going to be   given   to..... "1st come...1st served"  Welcome the3 -6 - 2 Defense  And with that money saved ...... Bill gets to keep it for himself !  Somewhat like what the CEO's of Ford / GM / AIG &amp; Bank of America ... etc. are doing!  Just watch.... if he pulls it off ...everyone will try it      Sine when have Wheatley and Wilhite been cut?? Both of these kids can play and will be better this year.
