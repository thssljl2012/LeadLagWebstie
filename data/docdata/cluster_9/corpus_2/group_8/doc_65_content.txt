I was thinking the same thing.    Basically, the league has a real financial problem through the Summer of 2011 when a new CBA will be negotiated.  Until then, teams are trapped into a pay structure that was negotiated when economic times were different.  A lot of teams are going to go broke if they don't get some sort of relief.  They can't just arbitrarily cut players' salaries in the midst of a negotiated contract, but perhaps they can work out some sort of exception where they can cut players and expunge them from salary cap and luxtax computations (while still honoring the terms of their contract).    Wow, i'd forgotten about that.  But wasn't it emphasized that it was a "one-time" event?  I don't think they go back to something like that.  Going to the economics of it, I think the owners' primary concern would be keeping salaries from growing.  But if they were to do another "Allan Houston Exception" in 2010, I think it would actually drive salaries up since it would allow about every team a bidder in that big offseason market.
