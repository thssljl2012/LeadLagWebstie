Easiest way to cut down on techs would be to improve the officiating.  - Crawford, with his spat with Duncan, has displayed that he can't control his temper any more than players like Sheed.  - Violet Palmer  - Superstar calls, gambling refs.

Do any of the 3 other big leagues do a more pathetic jump in regards to officiating/reffing/umping?
