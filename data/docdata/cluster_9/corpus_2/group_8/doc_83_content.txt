The issue is   whether the Pats took a lowball offer from Pioli and showed favoritism   in the process. As it stands, I'm happy they took as little as they   did, because they still picked up another draft pick - which does us   no good. If Brady should pull up lame this year, the second guessing   will be even more interesting than it is now.      I don't see what the patsies had to gain by showing favoritism to   Piolo - it's not like KC has any players that the patsies want.      Remember, the patsies didn't have the usual fallback position on this   deal, i.e., standing pat. There was no way they'd keep Cassell on the   roster after slapping the franchise tag on him, unless Brady couldn't   walk.      It's my opinion that they got what they considered was the best deal   for Cassell. We'll never know if they could have got more.      ProFootballTalk reports that the Browns aren't too happy about this   deal. They're trying to dump, er, trade Derek Anderson, and the   Cassell deal puts a ceiling on what they can get for their huge   disaster, excuse me, backup QB.                 I think everyone is right, to some degree.  Here are the reason I   believe Belicheat gave up his #2 for a #2:      1.  Pioli, like Belicheat, is a closet Bon Jovi fan.      2.  Belicheat wanted to dump salary, and Pioli agreed to help him   out.  Why else would Vrabel be part of the deal?  Clearly, Cassel is   worth a #2 all on his own.  Vrabel is excess cap baggage for Belicheat   that Pioli could use immediately to upgrade a shitty defense.      3.  Josh McDaniels has reached Mangini status in Belicheat's book.   The new Denver coach wasn't going to get Cassel in a Broncos uniform   if Bill could help it.  So the 3-way trade involving Cassel, Cutler   and Tampa's 1st round pick was never more than pissing in the wind.   Belicheat wasn't going to do that no matter what.      4.  Belicheat's ego tells him he'll find a starter for his Patriots   whether he's using the #12 pick or the #34 pick.  The #34 pick just so   happens to be a lot cheaper, so....      5.  I believe we're going to see more of this in the future, teams   avoiding high draft picks if they can help it.  There are plenty of   GM's in this league that don't like where things are going with regard   to trade value and draft pick salaries.      Belicheat just might be doing the Pats a big favor by trading Cassel   for slightly less than he's worth considering the savings the Pats   will enjoy with a lower (yet still pretty high) draft pick.  If he   drafts a starter with the #34 pick, where's the harm?  He also might   be doing the rest of the league a favor.  Cassel's value has been set   at a #2 draft pick.  Other QB's might be traded for less because of   it.         Terry Gowan----wonders when the NFLPA will get into the fray?   Hopefully soon, the NFL needs to have an open discussion about labor   issues, especially rookie salaries.  With the end of the current CBA   looming ever larger in the windshield, there's no time like the   present to start talking about it.   ---      I don't think we'll hear much from the NFLPA until they replace Upshaw.    Whoever ends up with the job will have his hands full on day 1.      Ron W
