          Well after approaching New Bloods, The #1 CWA Clan in RuneScape several times for several dates using severals rules and several preps ranging from 30mins-3 days it has come down to this.        Brutality Declares War On New Bloods        We wouldnt usual do this, but after all the talk and disscussion between both Brutality + New Bloods we want war and want to settle the dispute ASAP    .   They have complained about Preps. I have approached them for a Full out (1 week prep) and on numerous occasions Short Prep (30mins-1hour). They have declined both    I have asked for Single spells only Fights. Their leader replied with this.  [21:08:46]     [pow_jr01] because blitz is pretty useless on d hides lol, i cba to argue with you, we don't fight single spells in pvp because it doesent work, some1 will barrage or sum1 will chin or sum1 will do something       pm me if u wana multi spells fight  .   So today Brutality Officials approach new bloods for a  Multi spells short prep  for tonight. They have declined once again.       We cannot get any sort of Fight with them, they are either busy or have an excuse about the rules.          Accept this Challenge by posting here or Contacting either myself or another Brutality Official via msn.          Thankyou.
