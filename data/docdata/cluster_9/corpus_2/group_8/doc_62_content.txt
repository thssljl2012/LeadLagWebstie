2012 is a complete unknown at this juncture because of expected changes to the CBA.  It could be uncapped, it could have a much higher salary cap (if players are able to negotiate a higher percentage of revnue going to salaries), or due to a large economic downturn, a lower cap figure.  There is really no way to predict what 2012 will look like in 2009, so it is kind of an exercise in futility. _________________      RIP Slinging Sammy
