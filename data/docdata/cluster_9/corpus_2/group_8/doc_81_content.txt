        QUOTE (Bmwolf21 &#064; Mar 14 2009, 09:23 AM)       The debate about Peters' worth and value aside, this to me is more of an issue that has to be resolved in the CBA, where the union and owners agree to cap rookie salaries and signing bonuses so that guys who have never set foot on an NFL field are not making more than established stars.    Problem is the union wants nothing to do with it, because of situations like this.  Long gets his massive, undeserved rookie contract and Peters and as a result all the other established LT's can squawk and push for new contracts, raising the bar for everyone.    I couldn't agree with you more.  It screws up the balance of justified pay.  It's ridiculous for players that have never played one single down to get paid higher than any other player to have ever played the game of that same position.  How can this be??  Let me repeat that again, A player who has never played one single professional down, can get offered a contract more than any other player of that position in the entire history of the game.  That makes no sense.  They do have to have a rookie cap of some sort.  It's just ridiculous.
