      we use 7 poles which which latch together and total 48 foot. which can be very heavy however we can reach pretty much everydrey and do a good job.  we don't shoot the dreys more damge then good IMO! i also don't advise shooting the dreys but those who do it don't listen so cba to waste my breath explaining.   poke the dreys out the trees. you will be doing a great job and really helps to keep fit.   keep up the good work charlie  p.s squirrels will reapir damaged dreys so its better to knock em right out and make em work harder.
