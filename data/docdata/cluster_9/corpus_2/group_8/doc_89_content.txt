The reaction was don't be so effin stupid she can't stop looking at yer.   So a couple of pints later... I plucks up the courage to go and have a word, all nice and polite like...      She just looked at me and said,,DO YOU MIND I'VE COME OUT TO TALK TO MY FRIEND.       Whats the point in in all the glances if she wasn't interested.      Confused.com                        That's a shame, hd. You did the right thing approaching her, though, and found out she was a total biatch in the process
