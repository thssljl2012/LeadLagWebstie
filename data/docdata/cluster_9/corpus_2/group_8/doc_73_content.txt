      I wouldn't be so sure Campbell gets re-signed. If there is no extension of the CBA he will get tendered a contract but this is his year to prove that he is our quarterback of the future and when next year comes around it will be interesting to see what the FO and the coaching staff decide in the end. _________________ FFMD Redskins Defensive Coordinator    FFMD Skins Cap:  http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pBV6l5p0DMITEel3JnoUKZQ
