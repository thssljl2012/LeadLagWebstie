Multnomah Falls is great.  It is about a 30min Drive from Portland east on I-84.  If the weather is clear, Timberline lodge on Mt. Hood is great to see.  It is a nice 1.5 hour drive east of portland on Hwy 26.  If the weather is bad I would not go. Lots of snow on the roads this time of year.  If you are heading over to the coast I would just drive up Hwy 26 to seaside and then head south on 101 down the coast line to Canon Beach then back to portland.  When you head north to Seattle I would go to Mt. St. Helens.  It is about an Hour drive east off of I-5 to the lookout, and there is a lot of stops you can make along the way.  If you are going to be in Downtown Portland I would walk down the waterfront. Lots of great bridges to take photos of.  We have somthing like 19 of them that cross the Willamette River in the city of portland.  Take the tram ride located at  the south waterfront.  It takes you up to OHSU (Oregon Health Seicnce Univ.) GREAT VIEWS!!!  Go to the Portland city grill.  It is at the top of the U.S. Bank corp. Tower, Again Great views of the city.  If you want to eat and walk thru a great area go thru the Pearl District.  Lots of great old and new buildings.  If I think of more I will post them.
