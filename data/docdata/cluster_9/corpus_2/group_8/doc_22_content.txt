One of my friends, who is an event planner, said you  could  try to tactfully hint on the invitation, but it'll probably look tacky anyways. Maybe you can try word of mouth through your family?                      I'm amazed that an event planner would suggest that you could try hinting, especially on the invitation.  I've always heard that it's not even appropriate to talk about registries on a shower invite (maybe a little enclosure, but I thought that was also frowned upon), let alone asking for cash on the actual event invite.  I would really try to get people to work the word of mouth angle in a very discreet way.
