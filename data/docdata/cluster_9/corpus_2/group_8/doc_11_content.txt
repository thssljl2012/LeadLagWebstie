 Hi Dave..     Yes..actually the insurance guy at insuremytrip told me the same thing about AIG.  I think I'll be safe as far as missing the boat (excuse the pun!) because I'll be taking Disney transportation from AKV.  So I think I did OK.  But the issues you brought up were the concerns I was wrestling with!  Thanks!            __________________     Proud owner of VWL, AKV, BCV, and BLT           [IMG]      My Previous Trips 1971, June 1995, Feb 2005, Dec 2005 &amp; 2006 CR  12/1971, 6/95, 2/05, 12/05 &amp; 06 CR  6/2000 , 8/02  Wilderness Lodge, 07/03  Home to BCV and VB, 07/04, 07/05, 06/06 VWL &amp; AKL, 07/07 VWL,  04/08 AKV, 06/08 VWL and AKV,12/08 Poly!!
