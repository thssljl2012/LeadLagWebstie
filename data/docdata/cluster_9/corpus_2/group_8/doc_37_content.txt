I do. I think he absolutely, positively knew that he was rubbing grease on him. I do. Nobody can tell me different. I watched the tape a million times."      White says the greasing was "no different" than the illegal wraps discovered on the hands of boxer Antonio Margarito prior to his recent fight against Miguel Cotto. Margarito and his trainer, Javier Capetillo, both had their licences revoked for at least a year by the California State Athletic Commission.      "You put another fighter at a huge disadvantage, which is very dangerous," White said.      Mr White goes on to say    "Do I think Georges was trying to cheat? Absolutely not at all. But that cornerman was rubbing grease on him. You cannot do that."      Being the owner of the UFC Danas words will carry a lot of weight with the comission.   Dana Has already stated that something illegal has happned.But hes gonna have a hard time seperating st pierrre from the corner because the penn camp told the comission prior to the fight to watch out for St.Pierre greasing; they didnt say to watch out for phil nures they didnt say to watch out for Greg Jackson.They said to watch out for St.Pierre!!      Heres MY ANALOGY   Thats like if someone called the police and said George St.Pierre is going to rob a bank and they go to the bank and catch St.pierre Nurse and Jackson robbing the bank.and they only arrest Nurse and Jackson and say that St.Pierre had nothing do with robbing the bank.      Hey guys what do you think could George St. Pierre suffer the same consequences as Antonio Margarito?      The decision may not be overtunred,but losing half your purse and being suspended for 1year(may result in revocation of WW title)could definitley qualify as legal trouble                          yeah people are giving gsp the benefit of the doubt because of his public personna. white says the gsp would have won without the grease anyways. i disagree with that.
