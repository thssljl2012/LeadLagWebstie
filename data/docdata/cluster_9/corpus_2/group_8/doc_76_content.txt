      Since I'm the one who started this thread, I'll slightly tweak it, but stay on message of Hershey Bears, Washington Capitals and player development. There are likely multiple ways of viewing the Alzner situation.  Here is my take and then some questions for you to think about and perhaps respond:  1.) Washington Capitals are up against the CBA salary cap and have no current room on their books to accept Alzner UNTIL playoffs when the salary cap is no longer in play.  If called up today, he would still play the magical "less than 40 games" and keep an extra year before he is an RFA.  Is this "True" or "False"?  2.) Alzner was sent back to Hershey not because of the salary cap, but because of developmental aspects of his game, not publicly discussed and he needs to improve.  True or False??  3.) Alzner, right now, is a top 6 D-Man and should be getting a Capitals sweater on a nightly basis.  True or False??  This issue is concerning to me because I just can't figure it out.  To me it's one, or a combination, of the above scenarios.  Or is there another?
