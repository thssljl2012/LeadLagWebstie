      If that was the case i don't think there could be a better option in all of football then to get Julius Peppers....he's still got tons left in the tank....and with the CBA being gone we will most likly be able to keep the 1 or 2 players that we can't sign because they cannot be FAs untill 6 years and if a Uncapped year is reached there will be Two tags that they can put on players               _________________           ^Lone_Ranger90^
