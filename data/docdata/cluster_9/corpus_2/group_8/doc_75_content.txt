   Sorry but I would find it hilarious if they had a looooonnnngggg lock out and Bennett had to bleed more money while the players sat at home.  It would be rather fitting.  fitting of what? you got screwed so you you want ALL nba fans EVERYWHERE to suffer right along with you? you're better than that, doggie. knock it off.     Hey, I already went through one lock out. Where was your empathy then?  Don't blame me for the finance problems of the NBA. Blame your good buddy Stern for signing off on an unreasonableCBA that assumed that the league would keep growing at an extreme rate post-Jordan. If there is a lock-out, it is his fault and that is why I think that it would be fitting. Bennett got in bed with Stern and Stern's own incompetence might end up hurting him.
