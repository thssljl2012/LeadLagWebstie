If the players want MLB guaranteed contracts, then they will need to hold out for that right in the next CBA negotiations (i.e. long lockout / strike).                       That would be bad for that to happen Joe. That's when greed would step in. And the high market clubs would be able to pick up and over pay the FA's. Ala NY Yankees.                      Absolutely it would be bad - and the owners will   never   give into that demand.     That's why it would take years of striking to get it - and that will never happen. Football players have the shortest shelf lives in any major sport. Players aren't going to sacrifice their own careers in the hope that somehow, someway players in the future will get guaranteed deals.                                      __________________                You want analysis?
