      Yes, because our FO has no clue.  Id much rather have a FO like the Raiders or the Browns.        The reason they are struggling to come to terms with Harrison is because of no CBA next year and the new rules that come with it.        Harrison will probably be tagged next year if we cant come to terms with him.   They will work something out, but it probably wont be this year. _________________            Got 6?
