As it stands, Crabtree is still the guy you want to pair Housurmama with.  Without making a huge reach, you'd have to trade down for a RB, and who's going to want to trade UP to the 3rd spot in the draft in the last year of the CBA?                                         __________________                                                                           Last edited by Oldskool; March-2nd-2009 at  06:12 PM .
