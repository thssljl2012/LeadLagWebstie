                               6 years at 50 mil would be interesting. At 8 Mil per year it would be possible ( haven't read the CBA fine print) that in the first year of arbitration the player gets less than the signed contract if that is possible. Just something to think about. For reference  Tigers  gave  Rick Porcello  a 3.58 Mil bonus plus 2.6 Mil for 4 years plus club options for 2 years at 2.88 Mil. For a total of around 9 Mil. I found going from 9 Mil as the highest to 50 Mil a bit of a jump. I would say maybee about 10-15 Mil, as they are both represented by the same guy.
