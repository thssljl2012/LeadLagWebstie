Defensively, I don't quite think we are as set as some think.        a.  London Fletcher won't be here much longer.      b.  Jason Taylor has proven to be ineffective, and even if he turns things around this year, his shelf life is very limited.    c.  The jury is still out on Chris Horton.    d.  Depth at all three tiers of the defense is suspect.   e.  Questions surround McIntosh and his durability over the long haul (LB is a major concern in my opinion).     f.  We've gone through three years of the Andre Carter experiment and he is all of a sudden approaching his tenth year in the league and his 30th birthday.  Basically, two years from now and we are searching for defensive ends.       *  With that being said, I realize that there likely isn't a defense anywhere around the league that is in perfect shape.        You mentioned six guys.  Two of which in my opinion are not locks on our defense (Horton and McIntosh).  Personally, I'd also like to see more of what Landry can give us as well, before saying that he is definitely a keeper.        The locks going into the future that exists on our defense right now are Hall, Haynesworth, Rogers, maybe Landry.      Beyond these guys, there is way too much of a revolving door in terms of roster turnover offensively and defensively.      For example, on offense - by the time we find that new right tackle and right guard, guess what?  We will need to replace Chris Samuels.      We are just not positioned properly to make these bold moves.      I want to maximize the use of guys like Haynesworth and Hall.  Basically, I want signings like this to put us over the hump.       The way the rest of the roster is set up, they are just starting to push us up the mountain so to speak.                        Fletcher needs to be here as long as we can pay him to play.  He is an excellent educator and motivator.  And I agree with you on McIntosh.  But he is a talent if he stays healthy and if that happens the LB depth is helped a little.  But like I said... we need OLB now and MLB very soon.  Depth isnt part of my statement as it is always needed.  Especially at corner.      And I have been saying since this time last year that we should switch to rebuilding mode.  I just see these acquisitions as part of that.  I know not to back on the unknown... but its pretty much looking like cap space is null and void after 2010.  I heard John Clayton mention it would be a miracle to get a new CBA in place before it expires.
