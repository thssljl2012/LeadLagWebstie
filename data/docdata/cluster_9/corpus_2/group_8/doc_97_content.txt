 In a couple of days I have to have a short business meeting with someone who will be in town for the Circus at U.S. Bank Arena. Can anyone suggest a place to meet within easy walking distance of the Arena. The person I am meeting with has no transportation. Something like a hotel lobby would be perfect.            Thanks for any suggestions.
