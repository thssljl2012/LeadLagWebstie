 Shampoo and conditioner.. I use different ones all the time, and just tend to use other peoples that are in the shower as I cba to buy any.     I use dry shampoo as well, but again there's not a particular one I always go for.     Styling products (that I use probably on average of about once a month these days as I'm too lazy to do anything with my hair):  Tresemm Heat Defence Styling Spray  V05 Texturising Gum  V05 Firm Hold Hairspray
