      In that case, my apologies.It can be so tough to tell who's being glib and who wants genuine answers on teh interwebs. And with most of the characters on this board... one is better off assuming the former :)Please do let me know if you have other questions. I'll do my best to answer them ;)     -jack-ruby     No problem Jack, I've been lurking for a while and understand your position, 98% of what is here seems a little puffed up, but as my GeorgiaBoy boss tells me "even a hog finds a acorn every now and then". This past summer I had an oportunity to spend a week volunteering in the Washington DC area with a group of about 15 local teens. We did a little field gleaning, try keeping up with 15 teenagers in a kale field in august, but we also spent a couple of days in a facilty called "food &amp; friends". Their facility was quit an amazing place. 25,000 square foot facility, 6500 voluteers,159 delivery routes, 3000 meals a day.  http://www.foodandfriends.org  Allthough their group has a different client and their end product is a complete meal I think a similar facility could be useful. Providing volunteer hours for our kids to see what actually goes into what they eat.    Urge      "have a good day.....Paul Harvey"
