           How awesome would that be?  They change the ending and Dillinger opens his own bank, or something just as ridiculous.  He names it the Bank of America.  Then, the last scene, he sees a sign on the streetcorner....'Washington Mutual: Coming soon!' and realizes it's Christian Bale's character who's opening it. Gold, Jerry, gold!
