First of all, it is not spelled Treaux - it is Truax      Second - most reports are that he was, in fact, AGAINST the ABA crossover    http://www.oursportscentral.com/boar...ad.php?t=13063       The ABA/CBA deal was, from what I have been told, a Newman/Coyne production, and Truax went along as a show of league solidarity      So, what, actually do you "agree about" with "the Albany connection" seeing as you have the roles reversed and the information incorrect?
