Noone is in love with this OL,  giving Willie Colon a RFA tender wasnt bad business at all. I hate the guy,  but who do you want to play RT?  They couldnt even afford to sign all their own guys,  but we're shopping in FA for a RT?  I dont think so.  And for those worried about 2010 and beyond,  didnt several people want broken down 40 year old Mike Goff?        Why is it so bad to win a SB and keep your team in tact?  Get better building through the draft,  not overpaying to the point where you'll be cutting starters contracts in 3 years just to comply with the CBA like Cleveland.          The seasons been over for 5 weeks and they already cut loose Kendall Simmons.  Should we just fire the entire OL and hope to piece 5 new guys in by September,  or should we replace them when the right guy comes along.          Thats a huge problem with the common fan,  they want Mr. Right NOW,  instead of the right guy.         You guys,  and myself,  do this every year.  This year Im going to trust that they know what they're doing.             I dont think we should cut the entire line or bring in a bunch of new players, but I also dont like that the only moves we have made have been to secure the weakest part of our team.        Do you think Starks is worth the money he is getting?  Do you think he is worth $7mil a year?        Every year, I look at this teams future, and this is the first time Ive ever been this concerned.   Every other year I look over it, and see realistic and feasible ways to keep this team contending.   No, I dont claim to be an expert or smarter than our FO, but I know the difference between good moves and bad moves.        I dont care about Mr Right Now, and I do want the right guy, but looking ahead, what young, developmental players do we have on this team?  We have a few, none of which are ready to take over as starters, at least from what Ive seen.        Also, we have a boatload of FAs coming up in 2010....do you foresee all or even most of them being resigned?   Hampton and Keisel are both pretty old, yet we have no replacements for them.            I dont make impulse reactions.   Like I said, I am HOPEFUL everything will turn out for the best, but IMO, it looks like some dark days are ahead given everything we know AT THIS POINT. _________________            Got 6?
