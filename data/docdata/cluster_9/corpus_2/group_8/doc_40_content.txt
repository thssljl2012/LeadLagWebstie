        QUOTE (SanFran2121 &#064; Mar 17 2009, 10:11 AM)       Its a matter of getting something for him. He will franchise this year, than walk next year. Better to get a player or draft pick or two now than tie up cap and then let him walk. Not to mention he won't show up to camp or anything to show his displeasure, and end up negotiating a 'you can't franchise me next year' deal to actually sign the franchise tender.  Franchised players move to other teams fairly often, and no one gives up the two first rounds picks, think Matt Cassel.      I think the point here is that, under the terms of the current CBA, if a franchised player negotiates a contract with another club instead of signing his tender, then his former team is required to receive two first-rounders as compensation.  This is a requirement, not a convention.  In the case of Cassel, he was traded by his team AFTER signing his tender - meaning that the two-picks compensation no longer applied.  Peppers will not be able to sign directly with the Pats as they don't have two first-rounders to give up.  The only way this would happen would be via a sign-and-trade worked out by Peppers's agent - the problem, though, is that the Pats will in all likelihood not be able to satisfy the Panthers' asking price - which will be immense.
