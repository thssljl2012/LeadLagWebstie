What are the first symtoms of wear etc? (Is there noise, vibration?)   My Terri has just done 84,000km and it was an Ex-Lease car from ANZ bank up in Mackay, so it has had all it's scheduled servicing.   Is there anyway i can tell if they have already been replaced?      Cheers, for your help.                               Mate just get yourself booked in for a Pedders safety check. costs about $18 from memory, they will tell you whats wrong in there opinion and will more than likely included a whole bunch of bushes. But thats how they make there money. If your ball joints are shot they will tell you.      Usually you will get a clunck noise under hard acceleration or if your vehicle gets very light over the crest of a hll, you may hear a clunck from the ball joint moving in the nuckle.      If you dont want to book it in with pedders just jack up the front so the tyre is about 30mm of the ground, get a pry bar under the tyre and have someone lift the wheel up and down with it while you look at the ball joint, if its moving up and down its shot. If your not very mechanically minded, just get someone else to do it.
