 Well you know I live in Charlotte, don't keep up with the PGA, not taking up for either one of our giants but just wondering can these corporate sponsorships / contracts be terminated without reprecussions. For instance, if Bank of America decided to no longer sponsor the football stadium, would the city / Panthers be able to sue for breech of contract? Just thinking.
