           Only 16,000 tickets sold so far for Saturday's game! That is pretty disappointing considering that members are allowed 4 tickets per membership...people turned off by the high ticket prices?    (Unless of course Richard Hinds logged on to BF and saw PAX numbers around the 16k mark and thought, bugger it, I'll just use that figure   )         Quote:                         However, with fewer than 16,000 tickets sold so far, it appears they would do well to reach a crowd of 40,000, meaning the prospect of thousands of empty blue seats in the stadium where the AFL regularly makes its case for expansion.                      Big crowd at ANZ? Don't bank on it
