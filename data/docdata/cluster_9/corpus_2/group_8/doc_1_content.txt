NFLPA needs to decide on a replacement for Gene Upshaw first, and then they can start working on a new CBA.                      Gene Upshaw is dead.      He was perhaps the most management friendly union leader in the history of professional sports. Don't expect the next guy to cut the deals that Upshaw cut when he was alive.
