 This league is filled with people that work at Bank of America and I need an active owner to replace someone that is very inactive. This team is currently in 9th place out of 10 more due to the fact that he never changes his lineup. Some really good players on this team. We are wanting the league to be more competitive. Please provide your personal email address if you would like to take over this team. I will ask you for your "NBK" to verify that you do work at B of A.   http://games.espn.go.com/fba/clubhouse?leagueId=12947&amp;teamId=10&amp;seasonId=2009
