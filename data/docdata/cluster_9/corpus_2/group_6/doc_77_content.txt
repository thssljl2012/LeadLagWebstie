           It's one of those games wher it lasts as long as you want it to. If it's something you really enjoy you can play it over and over online and never bore. Or you can get sick of it within the first hour or 2 of playing and never pick it up again.      Personally I enjoy it, but only play it when my 3 flat mates play it with me otherwise i cba.
