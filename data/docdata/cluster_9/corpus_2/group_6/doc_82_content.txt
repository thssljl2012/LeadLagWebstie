well i have a theory that the canary yellow, because it stands out so much, makes the batsmen more aware of all of the fielders around them, whereas with the bottle green they just blend into the grass.      now i know they can see them regardless to pick the gaps, but just being aware of all those yellow guys around you, ready to pounce could have some degree of psychological effect on the batsmen.      Australia have been particularly poor in defending totals in recent years... an area in the past they excelled at.
