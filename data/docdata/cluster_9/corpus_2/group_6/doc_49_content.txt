If Messina is our next coach, Nocioni should be part of any JO package along with Gooden's and other expiring deals - just enough dollars to make the deal work under the CBA. The goal would be to keep Nocioni, and then have all the rest of O'Neal's dollars off the books, then either use the cap space or trade exception generated, of follow up with a Parker/Graham deal for a longer contract.  Messina's game includes lots of screens, even double and triple screens, and Nocioni sets hard screens and plays Messina's type of hard-nosed ball. That combination of moves would get us two wing players - Nocioni and whoever we could get for Parker/Graham/Will - and leave us enough room to sign Delfino and our draft pick.
