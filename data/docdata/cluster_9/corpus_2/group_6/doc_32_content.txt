I'd say the summers I spent unloading rose bushes were tough (they threw them at you from a truck, and you had to catch them, thorns and all), and unloading watermelons was tough for the same reason. But I had a great boss, so that made up for it.   The worst jobs are those with a-hole bosses, not the ones with the most grime, IMO. I've never dreaded a job like I did the one I had at Nationwide Insurance in Columbus, OH, working for a real bitch, the type that think the way to show they're boss is to be nasty to the underlings. Man, I'm glad I quit  that  one.
