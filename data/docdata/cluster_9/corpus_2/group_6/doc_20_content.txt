Question: We are basically building a team from scratch?             Yup, 32 expansion teams at once.  Just think CBA collapses totally and all NFL contracts are void.               It's going to be insane trying to get 53 players with only 123 mil.                Like most NFL teams your back-ups/special teams players shouldn't be earning much more than the base minimum. _________________          Sig by d-town11 thanks bro.
