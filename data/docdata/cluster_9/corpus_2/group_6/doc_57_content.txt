  Quote:   Most of us are at work and really really bored.  And Fleshpiston is just a perv who likes hiding in virtual bushes and stalking the womangs.  Pinky will post on anything as he's driven by some dark unmentionable outside force to spout random wads of text spontaniously.  LongThumb will post in any thread where he can make people hate Owain.   HAHHA.  I'm at work, really really bored too. Not that I don't have enough work to keep me busy. But the fact that I cba to actually do it.  This is good
