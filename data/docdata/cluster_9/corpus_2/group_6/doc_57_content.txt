Before the most recent CBA, teams couldn't trade a player on the Injured List.  They had to activate them to trade them.  The most recent CBA did away with the Injured List, and now just has an Inactive List.  D-Leaguers are, by definition, inactive.  Can a team trade a player while he's in the D-League?  I saw the Nets activated Sean Williams, and I wondered if that might have been a prelude to a trade.    That's exactly what I was thinking when I saw that, and I believe you're NOT able to trade guys assigned to the d-league.  So my thought is that's a sign a trade is in the works.
