I dont think you can simply just pay a portion of his salary, unless your under the salary cap.  It doesnt work under the CBA.  Steph is pretty hard to trade, his contract is just too large and his value is so low, I dont think anyone has large enough contracts to matching his without given up anything of value that have contracts that expire before 2010.  I really doubt Steph will be traded, and until hes ready to fork over alot more money (not just 1 or 2 million) then he wont play for anyone.
