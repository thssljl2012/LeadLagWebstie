As for the probable uncapped year of 2010 (barring a miraculous CBA agreement over the next half-year), there are severe restrictions in regard to its operation.       Let me do some research over the next couple of days. I know that Florio (in doing what he does best - contract analysis) did an in-depth analysis of the restrictions that would be in place in an uncapped 2010.       In short, my understanding is that the owners set up rules to insure that  teams could not buy their way out of cap hell in 2010 - and that will likely be the only uncapped year because the owners will not bring back the NFL until a cap is back in place.  Yes, that will mean a strike/lock-out - and it may be a long one.                      Probably a true statement, but just to see an argument on both sides (from anyone)... why would the owners use 1 year as an example to NOT bring back the NFL until a cap is in place.  Why only 1 year?      As we saw with the last CBA, it was a 13th hour signing, in which they EXTENDED the deadline by a few days (or weeks) I believe because the negotiations were THAT close.  They have a half a year to get a new deal, far beyond what it really takes, since nothing serious ever happens until 2 weeks before the deadline as it has happened that past few negotiations.      So why 1 year of uncapped madness, save for the conditions listed above?
