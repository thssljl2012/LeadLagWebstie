 I somehow won tickets to the game tomorrow night (Shoutout to 107.9!), and I was wondering if anyone has any tips on parking? The Observer suggests parking farther away, and taking the light rail...would this be the best option? If so...any suggestions on which station? I'll be needing to stop at the &amp;quot;Panther's Lair&amp;quot; at Mint &amp;amp; Morehead before the game...    Thanks!
