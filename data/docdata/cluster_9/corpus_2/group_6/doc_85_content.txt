    Im finding it pretty hard tbh Maybe because Im playing Pro Evo a lot, and 'cos I had a great save on 08 - like 7 seasons in and I was doing really well and stuff and I just cba to build another team like that again    I also find the gameplay not as smooth as 08, just my opinion though, so dont berate me
