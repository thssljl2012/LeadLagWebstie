This is clearly not the intention of the CBA.  David Stern can't have it both ways. He can't say Miles playing in 10 games proves he still has a special and unique talent that makes him a viable NBA player despite the possibility of a team playing him only to gain an edge over a competitor in the FA market and also say that a team would acquire Miles and not play him only for the purpose of preserving salary cap space.  David Stern's own actions prove the 10-game test is not a valid objective measure of anything.    Out of curiosity, what would you have him do?  The CBA has to set some kind of limit to determine whether a player can play again or not.  I don't actually see the contradiction you're referring to.  The 10-game measure isn't subjective at all...it's in fact very objective.  The medical PREDICTIONS originally asserted by the doctors are the test that was subjective. Playing in ten games is a finite, easily assessable measure.  But it may be  arbitrary .  I'll buy that.
