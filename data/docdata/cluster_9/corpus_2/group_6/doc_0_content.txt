I have an honest question for you snake and by answering this properly you might give unions some credibility but this just showsd how usesless they are.     Why are unions in sports.      Im not talking about for the ref's or those that work the concessions, im talking about the players.      What do the players need unions for.      The players already make 6 figure +++++ salaries, there are no work place hazards as they are involved in sport, they have the best health care out of anyone in north america, team docotrs pysio's when the average joe has to wait 6 months fora cat scan or mri the pros get it within 48hrs.     So why are they in sports? What give players the right to strike like the nhl and mlb players have befor?      You think unions are soooooo good and they are the way of the future.     Then why did the attendance of major league baseball drop dramatically after the strike. Montreal expos are no longer becasue of the loss of fan support after the stike, and the blue jays have meerly clung to life due to investors, average attendance at these games until recently have been in the 3000 not the 30000 that the skydome can house.     With the NHLPA voting weither or not to bring back the CBA i ponder to my self. What more could a hockey player need? and why do they hold the right to strike?      In many cities accross canada for servces such as teachers cops nurses firemen transportation workers it is illegal to strike, as it hold the general public hostage for their own selfish reasons.     so smart az      what purpose do players unions serve in professional sports.
