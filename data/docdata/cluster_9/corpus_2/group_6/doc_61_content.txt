PHI gives us Booth (PHI still pays his full salary) + Carney (PHI partly pays) + protected 1st?     Technically, Philadelphia sent us an undisclosed amount of cash to pay most of their salaries, since paying the salary of a player you trade violates the CBA.       philly.com wrote:  When he needed just a little more space, he traded Carney and Calvin Booth to the Minnesota Timberwolves, ostensibly for a second-round draft choice. He even agreed to continue to pay Booth's salary and about two-thirds of Carney's salary.     I questioned this when I read it, and I agree that only cash can be set aside for future salary, but there are other ways to make this payment.  First, I assume that PHI is paying the trade kicker, and second, perhaps there's up to 30% of deferred salary that PHI can pick up.  I'm not sure exactly what's going on, but zgoda said just before the deadline to cut the roster to 15, that the Wolves front office was hoping to trade Booth for cap space and a late pick.  Now, between philly.com, zgoda, and my limited understanding of the timing of writing the checks, something is inconsistent.
