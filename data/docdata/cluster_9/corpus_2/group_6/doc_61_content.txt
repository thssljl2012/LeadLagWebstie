Some of you probably know that I work for Bank of America, and Charlotte is the headquarters.     I've heard that there were 19 bank employees on that flight.     Kudos as well to the pilot, like he'll ever read this but that was one amazing job.     I heard one report that he missed the G. Washington Bridge by 900 ft.
