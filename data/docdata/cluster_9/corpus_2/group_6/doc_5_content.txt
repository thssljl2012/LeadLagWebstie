Sorry, Pittsburgh, PA was where the web casts were handled.  I spoke with one of the owners and they really want to find someone to handle the web casts.  He is meeting with someone, but so far no luck.  I mentioned the lack of radio on the web and he said he would check into that also.  We really need to find a tech person to handle this!  I loved watching the Cav's on the road last year!
