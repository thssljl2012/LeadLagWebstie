        QUOTE (Chopsus &#064; Jan 25 2009, 07:30 PM)       I noticed the other day that they are tied up with ANZ somehow ...... and I have noticed lately that electrical products serviced/backed by ANZ always seem to be on the cheap side .... or am I imagining this?     Tied up with ANZ as a business?... mmmm strange, maybe they just bank roll Belikin in OZ?.
