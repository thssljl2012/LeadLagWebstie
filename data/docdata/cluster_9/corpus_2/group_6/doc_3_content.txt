The NHLPA had never even heard that this "policy" was in place. Ken Holland didn't know that this "policy" was in place. How can you expect the players to comply with it, if they aren't even made aware of the fact that its gone from general discussion to being an enforceable "policy"? A grievance is being filed and I suspect that this will never happen again.      2. The loophole was only extended to the Wings brass on Friday. Lidstrom was getting his elbow looked at/ treated over the weekend, and couldn't go to Montreal because of this. Datsyuk hasn't really talked much with the media about the issue, but it seems like the team told him it would be better for his strained hip flexor if he stayed back. These injuries sound legit to me.      3. Using the example of Crosby being able to make it hardly seems fair. He had already planned on going because of sponsorship obligations, and had the benefit of being the first one Bettman/ Campbell contacted to work things out. It was as simple as showing up one day early for him, where Pavel and Nick hadn't made plans to do so. I almost think that if Crosby couldn't make it, nothing would have come of this.        4. If showing up is such a big deal, why isn't Steve Mason being suspended? If this policy isn't written down and is open to interpretation, why can it not be applied to Mason as well?       5. And finally, if the NHL heads had made clear a month ago, or even 2 weeks ago, that this was going to be the course of action taken, there would have been no excuses. But it was sprung on the Wings last minute, with no warning that this "policy" was going to be exercised.                      I'm not sure where I heard this, but the CBA says that it wont suspend players on entry level contracts.
