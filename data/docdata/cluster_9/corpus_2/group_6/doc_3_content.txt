 May be they have changed the CBA recently. Wherever I look it says there are only RFA with an expired three year contract. However, the CBA itself which I downloaded from the NFLPA website provides for three- and four-year RFA. Strange. _________________      Thanks Ryk for the sig!!                  ryknowssd wrote:               If Brandon Spikes falls to the 2nd round, I'll wear a nothing more than a pink tutu &amp;amp; go streaking through my neighborhood.
