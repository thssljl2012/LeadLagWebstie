 I use google maps &amp; I think it is amazing. No pun intended. It is text only but works really well. I also like the options for street view, public transpot &amp; walking directions. Besides I can ask for a home depot or a citibank closest to my current location and it gives me various location options to choose from which is great when I am in an unfamiliar area.
