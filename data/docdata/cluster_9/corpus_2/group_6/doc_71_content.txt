Question: We are basically building a team from scratch?             Yup, 32 expansion teams at once.  Just think CBA collapses totally and all NFL contracts are void.               It's going to be insane trying to get 53 players with only 123 mil.                thats the estimated cap for '09, it will take patience and a hell of a lot of knowledge of schemes
