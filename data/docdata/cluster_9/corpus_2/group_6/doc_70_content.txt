I heard they chose to have their contracts end in 2010 because of the assumption that the new CBA would allow for an increased max over what they could have signed for three years ago. Is that assumption still valid, especially in light of the worldwide economic downturn/catastrophe?  Anyway, the situations for previous Raps were unique. Who knows? But if in 2010 we're a perennial playoff team with capspace and a PG who can make you look good, then there really shouldn't be a problem.
