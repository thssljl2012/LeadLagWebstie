             Man, Jonathan ima PS3 user and avid **bleep** watcher... We grown ass mans out here...LOL Dont worry bout these dudes...Can you pm some of those sites that you frequent??    I couldnt find any sites that work on the PS3... Iuse my PS3 browser almost everyday.... Dont have a laptop and hate having to get up everytime i wanna check something on the net...      These forums, another local forum, car forums,Bank of america, Youtube, Hulu, Ebay, etc...      Yea it isnt perfect but with the last flash update... It makes the browser very functional and can be used for 90% ofMY internet needs...
