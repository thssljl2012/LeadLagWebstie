We have things like a HiFi, slow cookers, a Kitchen Aid (far cheaper in the US) via the transformers.     OTC products are far cheaper over there, as Rachiie said.     If you want Montreal Salt with your steaks, they've stopped selling it here. We did get some brought back over for Christmas!     Spare bed linen for US sized beds, especially the very large ones (my wife came up with that one!)     If you intending to holiday back in the US consider keeping a US bank account open, as we do.     Good luck!                      Thanks - all very useful stuff! Am all out of reps right now but will get one to you later!    Does the Kitchen Aid work ok? I emailed the KA company about that and they said it wouldn't!....   I guess they wouldn't be able to honour the guarantee if it blew up, but hopefully it won't!!! lol
