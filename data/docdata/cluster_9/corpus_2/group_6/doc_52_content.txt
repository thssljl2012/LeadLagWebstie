Thank you both for your kind words.  I sometimes feel that I am a boat on the ocean and I am drifting further out to sea.  To Mom's Buddy, BofA is a shortened version of Bank of America, my mother's bank.  As of why my sister and her daughters would call APS on me is because they decided that if they could get conservatorship of mom, they could sell her home and put her in a nursing home.  My sister moved to Seatle from California when I asked her to help care for our parents; now she wants to come back and stay with mom.  Mom doesn't want this because my sister is bipolar.  The reason that ADS asked mom to strip was that the report said that I had been physically and mentally abusive.  Mom and I both agreed that we would do what was needed to show that mom was being cared for and not abused.  Mom lives in her home; I have a home 30 miles away.  I cannot leave her alone so half the time I am with her in her home and the other half she comes up to where I live.  Bunny's girl; my sister did not have ANY concerns about the care I was giving our mother; it was just a way to try to get me out of the house so that they could sell it and put mom in a nursing home.  Thanks for listening.
