I don't think the nba can penalize us because we didn't break any rules.  We were ballsy, very bold, and very unprecedented in our approach but we did not violate the CBA in this email.      Minnesota is the only team I can recall being penalized in draft picks and they were because McHale is so incompetent he WROTE in Joe Smith's contract that they would sign him to his small contract then give him the max next year (or something very similar).  Which was illegal.
