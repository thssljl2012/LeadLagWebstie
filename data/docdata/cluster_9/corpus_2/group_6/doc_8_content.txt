                                                         I doubt any team is going to take a chance on Vick if he's  reinstated.  He comes with a lot of headaches and the owner of any classy organization isn't going to want to upset sponsors or draw negative publicity to themselves.    Say Vick signs with the Cowboys for instance and all the animal rights organizations start a campaign to boycott all the  corporate sponsors of the Cowboys.  Those organizations  would begin a campaign against Ford Motor Co, Miller  Brewing (the beer company), Dr Pepper, Pepsi, Papa John's  Pizza, and Bank of America.  That's just a few, but that's how these sorta things work.  That then hurts the sponsors and  they put pressure on the franchise.  That isn't something  an organization is going to want to deal with.
