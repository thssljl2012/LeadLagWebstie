Toronto FC would then deal Conde and possibly another player or Allocation money to the Red Bulls in exchange for our second DP slot.  Toronto reportedly has accumulated something like 1mil in Allocation money so they could, theoretically, have two DPs and still be able to have a great supporting cast.  That said, this would make sense only if the Red Bulls are able to get Conde to extend his contract past his one remaining year.                      Conde for the second DP gets interesting doesn't it? He's got one year left on his contract and has visions of europe in his immediate future. That and this is the final year of the CBA. Tough call.  Is Conde DP worthy which this deal would mean and can Redbull fit him under the cap.Get him re-signed to a cap friendly longer term contract then we can start talking.      He is Osorios man crush though. If this is true, although I'd read that Chicago was open to any deals to Europe, Agoof better be there to protect this teams longer term best interest in any deal and not have Osorio ready to drop trou at the first sign of a deal. Chicago trading Conde and possibly losing Soumare to Europe as well, that just guts that defense.
