Walsh would be wise to informally re-open negotiations fairly soon (if that's permitted under the CBA), and find out if Lee's agent intends to remain unreasonable.  Obviously, the last thing we can afford is for Lee to either leave without compensation or for Walsh to be blackmailed into matching a crazy offer.
