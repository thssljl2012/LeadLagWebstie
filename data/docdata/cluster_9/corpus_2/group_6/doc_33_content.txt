Trump and 210 Trade I would consider pretty much dead unless a solid news source comes out saying otherwise.     Also, the 30 floor 1 Bank of America is finally going up. The concrete core is several floors above ground now and the steel should be following it shortly. The Aloft hotel recently opened, but the Ritz-Carlton is still a little ways away from completion.     You can see the angle on the steel work for the Wellschovia in the photos above.
