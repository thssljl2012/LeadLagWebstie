 Okay, so I was in the middle of explaining to my dawtr, in front of the whole family, how to handle the occasional burst of pain that comes while fencing, when a shot gets in on a tender area. Just as I was about to get into focusing your emotions outward rather than keeping them bottled up, I picked up some junk mail and got a wicked paper cut in the crease of my middle finger. I stopped my discourse and said " . . . OH! SON OF A  BITCH  THAT HURTS!!!!   See? See how I directed the pain I was feeling outward into anger, rather than keeping it in?"     I was so fucking pissed at that piece of junk mail that I actually set it on fire on the stove, then put it through the paper shredder. My awtr then said "You showed that junk mail who is boss, daddy!"      Lesson learned.      I mean, look at this thing! WTF? It was from Citibank. I should sue their asses.
