        QUOTE (cehnehdeh &amp;#064; Jan 2 2009, 04&amp;#58;49 PM)       Any CBA geeks in here?  Will LTI cap relief cover from his last game played? If so wont you guys have a TONNE of cap room now to play iwth for the rest of the year? Shanny? Murray?    i would love to see shanny brought in. i dont see it happening though. why would they spend the money when it wont change the end result?
