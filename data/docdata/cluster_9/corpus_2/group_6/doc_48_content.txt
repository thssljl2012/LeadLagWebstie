And as far as "product" as you like to call them, having part time employees from Hardees, Burger King, Quik Stop and Ricky's Oil Lube as your players, thats not something to get overally excited about.       All the Mustangs are is a recreational team that paid a fee to a league that allows them to play games when they are able to put them together, and in the process, give this "team" the ability to make some money on the side by allowing them to use the ABA logo to give some credibility as a "pro league".       At the end of the day, however, all you have is a bunch of 5th rate players trying to squeeze in some scrimmage games in between their work shifts, and attempt to pass them selves off as "pro players" to the public with uniforms and an ABA logo. And if they can make a few extra bucks doing it, the cheerleaders can get some exercise and 10-15 "fans" can catch some entertainment...all the better.                      Well, when you are in the business your team is your product and that term is perfectly acceptible in this case...      I will also back Gusher in the fact that his players are above the level of MOST ABA teams and aren't working jobs at Hardee's, etc.  Tim Pledger has played for me a couple of times and is a servicable player...I think I read that Alvin Jefferson was playing for this team and he is a solid pro as well.  This team does have some pros that are used to playing for a living...      However....when you are basing the success of your product on the quality of the league you play in....This team is in REAL trouble.  I could see them in a reinvigorated CBA or the PBL.  BUT...It's hard to build a fanbase when they aren't excited to see your team when they are new.  A LOT of winning (against quality competition) is the only way that might happen...and of course...quality competition and ABA don't go in the same sentence....      Gusher...if you see Big Alvin Jefferson and Tim Pledger, tell 'em Tom Nelson from the USBL days says hello.
