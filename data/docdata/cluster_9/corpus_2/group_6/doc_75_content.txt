This throws a HUGE caveat into the whole post 2009 UFA list that the Chargers need to resign.      It makes Rivers the obvious priority (although, he probably would sitll be the priority even if a new CBA was done).      It also gives the Chargers a bit more wiggle room and time to sign their core that were set to be UFA post 2k9.
