I think those 82-83 jerseys are far superior to the jerseys they've had for the last 10 years or however long it's been.  I don't think it really has anything to do with any "fads" or anything like that.  The new Sixers jerseys are just corny.  They've always looked they belong to a CBA team or something.  Plus, you look at teams like the Lakers and Celtics and they still wear pretty much the same jerseys they always have.  Philadelphia used to be known for its basketball, too.   If true, this would be a step in the right direction.  Those old jerseys are awesome.
