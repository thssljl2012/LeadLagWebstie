This is getting ridiculous. The real issue here is that the league has created this weird situation in which other teams can hold significant power over the Blazer's salary cap.      That's a problem because the CBA and the cap structure is set up to prevent such gamesmanship.  By utterly failing to fix the situation, the league and I'd imagine the player's union has done Darius Miles (a union member) and one of its teams (the Blazers) massive disservice.      That being said, the Blazers are missing the boat and creating more problems in the way they're handling this.  If I were Darius Miles' lawyer, I'd be preparing a letter of my own this morning, perhaps more.  If I were another team, I'd be that much more irritated with the Blazers.
