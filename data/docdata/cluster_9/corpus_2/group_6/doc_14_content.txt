I've been wondering about   the new Bank of America logo that they started using recently.      I can't quite get what they're doing symbol-wise.             I know that square tipped up on one corner is an occult symbol   but I have the feeling there's more going on with this logo than   I have figured out.      Any ideas?      graflok                             Bank of America  logo (picture I took):       ^ This logo is full of symbolism.           1.  It is 3 number 11's which =  33 . (33 is one of the  master numbers , and also a most important number in both Masonry and the occult)       2.  Each 11 can also represent  Jachin &amp;amp; Boaz .       3.  The overall shape of the logo is that of the  47th Problem of Euclid , so beloved by Masons.       4.  The two red &amp;quot;11's&amp;quot; represent the  foot pattern  that a Mason stands in. Note, how the blue 11 is not flush to the edges of the two red 11's - demonstrating this point.
