Can the Knicks structure the contract that way? Is that allowed?  No. I believe something like that would be against the CBA rules.    You can do a front loaded contract. But I think it has to go down by 10-15%% each year or something. Like you just cant give Lee 20 million this year and then 3 the next. I know Kirk Hinrichs contract is front loaded.
