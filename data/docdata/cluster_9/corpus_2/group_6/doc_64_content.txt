The most common was the following conversation.      user "so where y'all from"   Me "Calgary Alberta Canada"   user "oh what States that in"   Me "..............................................WUT  ?"          It's like the world geography section doesn't exist in US Schools.                      I know people more ignoarant than that.      Italians, Puerto Ricans, or any one with brown texture -- They are Mexican, and they don't speak english. Oh that pisses me off. Main reason I pretend to not know English 'round these here parts.
