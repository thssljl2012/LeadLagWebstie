A decap, starting round 3, will NOT count as a bone break and neither will pulling off limbs! Maybe its because it want make clear, but it isnt in fact breaking a bone at all, its just tearing ligaments as far as I know.    To do a successful bone break from now on, you will need to break-   -arm   -leg   -pelvis   -ribs   -spine (benefit of the doubt)       Thats it.   This will start round 3, so dont worry, you wont lose your scores.      Bonk, if youre interested, the reason you got 7 is because the judges a whole (i assume) felt not enough power was included in the attacks, as well as that it simply wasnt as dynamic as some of the others, which is arguably harder to do.      If youd like to know why you got the score you did, anyone, I can take a guess (after all, Im a judge myself and the scores are all fairly similar)                  Edit: I just checked, and this round has the second highest number of replies for ANY competition thread. Cool :P                      do we need to break all those parts?   and is the second period over already?   I want to post my 2nd attempt tommorow, or maybe at saturday...
