He was born on 11th January 1958..    &amp;gt;    &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; No, this is not a coincidence. *I saw the birthday list on chesscafe  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; and then my question occurred to me.  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Chances are that the answer to my original posting is yes. *Rather a  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; rare name and many successful chess players have careers in finance,  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Ron Henley GM being perhaps the most notable.    &amp;gt;    &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Paul Epstein    &amp;gt;    &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; I'd suggest that Dr. Kenneth Rogoff is at least as notable (and was  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; probably a stronger player in his prime). *He is an economics  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; professor at Harvard and previously served as Chief Economist for the  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; International Monetary Fund (IMF).    &amp;gt;    &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Randy Bauer.    &amp;gt;    &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Thanks, Randy.  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Note my &amp;quot;perhaps&amp;quot;. *I would think that, across the chess spectrum, Ron  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; Henley would probably be said to have achieved more.  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; This is not considering just playing strength, but all chess  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; activities. *For example, I think Henley has served as Karpov's  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; second.    &amp;gt;   &amp;gt; &amp;gt; What about David Copperfield? He's a magician and he had that book  &amp;gt; &amp;gt; written about him.- Hide quoted text -   &amp;gt;  &amp;gt; Yes, very likely to be Shaun, who retired in 1981 at the insistence of  &amp;gt; his, then, new wife. Christine went on to be good at Bridge. He has  &amp;gt; become Chairman of BCM of late, but plays very seldom. Henley was  &amp;gt; Karpov's second. Rogoff was with the World Bank but no major GM, he  &amp;gt; got into the 1976 Biel Interzonal, I don't think he was ever an  &amp;gt; Olympiad player.     But what about David Copperfield?
