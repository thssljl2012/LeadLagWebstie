As I wrote in other thread: Ruffin has been injured from Day 1. If Bulls did waive him, he would have to be paid per CBA rules because he is injured. So Bulls decided to keep him since they must pay him anyway.  Bulls can still trade him even if injured  Hunter however would not have been paid if he was released.
