MLS should be competing for the mid to upper tier South American first division talent, not for lower tier EPL/La Liga/Serie A talent.                      Great point, but I'm afraid that it is simply a more sophisticated version of Beckham-mania on the part of many potential fans (and posters on this board).  They are only interested in the 4-1-1 cover boys.  Even worse are the NE Portuguese who only want to see their compatriots play.  At some point you have to ask "why do you follow the sport?".  Because objective entertainment or competitive reasons don't seem to be the answer.
