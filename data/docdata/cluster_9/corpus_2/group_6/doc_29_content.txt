I realize you guys are just messing around, but since you only did firsts every other year, I figure you were at least semi-trying to follow the CBA. So I'd just like to point out that according to the CBA, you can't trade 1sts more than 5 years in advance. So, we can't trade anything other than a 2011 unprotected and a 2013 unprotected.
