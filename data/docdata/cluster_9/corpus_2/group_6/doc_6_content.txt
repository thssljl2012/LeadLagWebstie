      From what I hear, Kraay is indeed about to become significantly Ferdinand-Harrised. Only question left is who pays it.        It just continues to make the stratification of salaries in this league look absolutely ludicrous (as I've argued several times before). Should've blown up the salary structure in the last CBA, instead of basically doing absolutely nothing new or remotely thought out whatsoever.
