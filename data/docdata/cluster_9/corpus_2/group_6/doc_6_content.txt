  I agree that it is a 50/50 situation. One of the problems was that the Padres offer to Hoffy had been out there for 4 months. If it had been left out there I was told by someone in the FO that due to the CBA it would have become a binding offer and could not be pulled.  I know Hoffy was out of the country, however, his agent was here and must have had ways to communicate.  This was a mess created by both parties.
