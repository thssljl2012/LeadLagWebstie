   Well, I guess I you are a huge pu*sy It's cold. If you have a decentJacket, gloves and hat on, It's really not that bad. It's only this cold for maybe 2 weeks a year. I play outdoor hockey on a teamwith temps-5 sometimes. Move to Oregon???Lol.    Minneapolis &gt; Oregon.  That's why we make more money than you I guess. What's does oregon have to offer? Minneapolis started Best Buy, Target, 3M, General Mills, Cargil, built the first ever mall in the USA. Why the fu*ck would I move to Oregon?      Oregon = Nike  Nike &gt;&gt;&gt; Best Buy + Target + General Mills + Cargil + Mall of America    Dude, I'm pretty sure Cargill alone is bigger than Nike.  There are a disproportionate number of phenomenally large companies headquartered in Minnesota. Besides Target, Best Buy, General Mills and Cargill, you've got United Health, Supervalu, CHS, Travelers, Carlson Companies, US Bank, used to have Wells Fargo up until relatively recent, though leadership is still from Minnesota, etc. There are literally 10 companies larger than Nike based out of the Twin Cities.
