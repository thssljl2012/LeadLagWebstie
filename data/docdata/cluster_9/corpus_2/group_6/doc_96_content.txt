Normally in labor negotiations, it is labor vs. management when it comes to higher wages.  Yet here you have the fascinating situation where it is labor + some of the owners (AEG, Red Bull, probably Roth/Allen, etc.) pushing for higher wages vs. the rest of the owners.  I can't think of any other business where something like that has happened.      AEG, Red Bull and company aren't being generous, of course.  They feel that raising the cap improves the quality of the product which will make it more popular, bringing in higher profits.  The others feel that improving the quality of the product will not make it more popular, and therefore they will lose money.  It's really as simple as that.      I know that I am biased, since I want to see higher quality, but this strikes me as analagous to the car industry.  No one is talking about building a Mercedes, but AEG/RBNY is proposing to upgrade a bit and make a Toyota Camry or Honda Accord, while the others want to keep turning out a 1978 Chevy Vega.  And we all know how well that turned out for the US car makers.
