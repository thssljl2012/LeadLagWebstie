         "  LONDON, March 6 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) is retrenching to its core businesses and plans to exit up to 36 countries, but unpicking a decade of deals in the eye of a financial storm will be a long slog.  Retail and commercial banking businesses in Asia, such as in India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Taiwan, are likely to find the most interest.  HSBC (HSBA.L), Standard Chartered (STAN.L) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ.AX) are all considering bids for the Asian assets, people with direct knowledge of the matter have told Reuters.  Prospective buyers -- even those with reinforced balance sheets -- are wary of using precious capital on deals, however.  "Acquirers are scarce and they are scared," one banker said. "It only takes a suggestion that they might be overpaying for an acquisition and their stock is down."  RBS has also put its central and east European (CEE) units on the block and signalled all or parts of U.S. bank Charter One will be pared, but they may need calmer times to get interest.  Chief Executive Stephen Hester -- backed by majority shareholder the UK government -- is reversing the acquisitive strategy of his predecessor, Fred Goodwin. [ID:nLQ259274]  It will focus RBS on retail and commercial banking in Britain and the United States and target a much smaller investment bank on big financial hubs and 17 key countries. In effect, RBS is quitting wherever it lacks scale.  .. "  http://www.reuters.com/article/mergersNews/idUSL617188820090...    Back to basics it seems.  awbMaven
