Legions of Australian corporations face huge debt repayments or rollovers in the next year or so. Some are among our biggest employers while others earn hard currency from exports. Some, such as Oz Minerals, are fighting for survival.       So who convinced the Federal Government it should team up with the big four banks to tip $4 billion into a fund to help the commercial property industry, just in case a foreign bank pulled out of a lending syndicate?       It is now pretty clear his name is Ahmed Fahour and until yesterday at least, his day job was as a senior executive of the National Australia Bank.      Fahour, once considered a golden child at NAB, was passed over for the top job last year. As luck would have it, yesterday it appeared he was being considered as the best candidate to administer this new fund.      But some puzzling questions remain. Why just commercial property? Why has NAB taken the lead? And why would the Prime Minister and the Treasurer capitulate to this request?       Comments from those intimately involved appear to be at odds with the speed with which the fund has been assembled and the amount of money involved.      According to Cameron Clyne - Fahour's new boss at NAB - there is no evidence that foreign banks are withdrawing capital. So, why are taxpayer funds being put into the hands of our big banks? Clyne argues "it [withdrawal by foreign banks] could become a very real possibility".      The words "could" and "possibility" seem rather at odds with the swift action the banks and the Government took over the weekend.       It is fairly clear that while US and European regulators are demanding total transparency from their banks for the mess in which they have landed us, our banks continue to operate behind a veil of secrecy and in tandem with our authorities.      Each of the big four banks has pledged $500 million for the fund, although it appears that Commonwealth Bank and ANZ Banking Group were reluctant participants.      Reluctant they may be but there is no way either could refuse a Federal Government request. In recent months there has been a relaxation of competition rules to increase market share, keeping a big slice of interest rate cuts and, of course, those handy Federal Government guarantees on bank deposits and offshore borrowings.      It is never easy for any bank simply to exit a lending syndicate. Those that do, leave other members in the lurch and in effect rule themselves out of ever doing business with their partners again.      If a foreign member did want to exit, Australia's big four banks are sufficiently well capitalised to buy them out. But perhaps capital is not the problem.      Many of our banks are at their limits in terms of exposure to single companies, geographic regions or industry limits. Therefore they cannot justify more exposure. So an amorphous fund could just do the trick.       But the real danger is this. If a foreign member of a banking syndicate were to pull the plug, it could sell its debt to an offshore vulture for a fraction of its value, say 50c in the dollar.      If that were to happen, under an accounting rule known as "mark to market", all the other members of the syndicate would be under pressure to raise their provisions for bad and doubtful debts. That would eat heavily into bank earnings and profits, something the Government is reluctant to contemplate.      Clearly, some foreign banks such as HBOS and the Royal Bank of Scotland are under pressure to concentrate on their home markets, given their partial nationalisation.      But their ability to quit Australia might have been made that much easier by the creation of this new fund.       Our commercial real estate companies such as Centro have copped a hiding during the financial market meltdown of the past year - and rightly so.      Once upon a time they were fairly conservatively run, investing in bricks and mortar and renting at a profit. But in the past decade, they have expanded rapidly, borrowed to the hilt and built trust structures that relied on boom conditions lasting forever. And of course, it was the banks that funded this folly.                      http://business.smh.com.au/business/...0126-7q1x.html       Looks like Rudd and Swan have been arse clowns yet again....
