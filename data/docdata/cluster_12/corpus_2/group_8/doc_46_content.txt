This is HUGE from last PR: The Courts approval is a positive step forward in resolving our financial challenges, solidifying the basis of confidence of our suppliers and customers, and enabling our operations to continue without interruption, said Craig A. Rogerson, Chemturas Chairman, President and CEO. It is a significant step forward in our plan to position Chemtura as a strong, viable, and profitable competitor in the specialty chemicals marketplace. The Court granted Chemtura interim approval to access $190 million of its $400 million Debtor-in-Possession financing (DIP) from Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent. The DIP, combined with cash from the Companys ongoing operations, will provide Chemtura with financial flexibility to operate its business in the ordinary course, including funding post-petition payments to suppliers and meeting other customary business obligations, during the financial restructuring process. The Company also announced that it received the Courts approval to, among other things, pay all outstanding employee wages, health benefits, and certain other employee obligations. Additionally, the Company is authorized to continue to honor all of its current customer policies and programs, to ensure the restructuring process will not impact customers.
