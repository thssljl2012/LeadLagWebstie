         updated 6:45 p.m. ET, Fri., April. 18, 2008        NEW YORK - Sears Holdings Corp., which operates Kmart and Sears stores, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday that Bank of America will not renew its $1 billion long-term credit amendment under its existing terms.        The agreement is scheduled to end in July 2008.  As of Friday, only $1.6 million in letters of credit were outstanding under that agreement, Sears said.         Sears, whose chairman in hedge fund investor Eddie Lampert, said most of its outstanding credit is issued under its $4 billion, five-year revolving credit facility which expires in March 2010, which has a $1.5 billion letter of credit sublimit.        The Hoffman Estates, Ill., company said it is now using its second letter of credit so the termination will not have any effect on its liquidity.        Banks are tightening credit lines to retailers amid a weakening economy. On Tuesday, HSBC and Bank of America said they will either cancel or not renew lines of credit to women's apparel retailer Talbots Inc.        Sears shares fell $3.95, or 3.8 percent, to $100.77 during electronic aftermarket trading, after closing up 96 cents at $104.72.            source:         http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24206653/
