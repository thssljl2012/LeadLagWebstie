bhp looks to be a good get at around 25 dollars, the take over of rio will go ahead it just depends when as rio might be forced to sell assets in order to make the take-over kosher and doesnt create a new firm that is all powerful     also cba has done supremely well over these gloomy times, it has played around the 40-45 mark and it dropped below 40 only recently due to the floating of more shares to purchase bankwest...so in the end win win...
