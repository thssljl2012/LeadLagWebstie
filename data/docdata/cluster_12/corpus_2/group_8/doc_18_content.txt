 Given that CIBC made $175 million last quarter after close to $1.0 billion writedowns on asset based paper and derivatives, the retail branch network is generating hundreds of millions of dollars every quarter. Once all the toxic assets are purged the markets will value these core earnings at a higher multiple.  I have been shorting TD and RY and going long CM during the last 3 months. At one point RBC was worth 2.5 times CM. CM's branch network is the best in Canada (quality of premises, serviceand locations). I like their strategy of focusing soley on Canada.  Every time CM gets down to $40 ish I buy.  Canadian financials getting sideswiped by Bank of America and Citibank presents a good opportunity for entry.
