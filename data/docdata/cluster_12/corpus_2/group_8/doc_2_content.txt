Jake-- I am posting a anothers called SDE from H.cop they are more clued up than I am.Personally I would have thought nothing is secured,everthing is hocked up to its neck,Shraz indicated $200 million on T1 AND T2,to pay that you need a lot of change,or script,yes ?No?at best 2nd guessing.   below is SDE comment         Quote          There is actually considerably more debt than that.      Club Bank Facility $380 million (ANZ, CBA &amp; Mizuho)   Debenture $250 million (ANZ)   (These facilities have all the land as security)      Trees2 $80 million ) Unsecured   Trees3 $120 million ) Unsecured      Total $830 million      105 million of Club Bank plus 80 million of Trees2 needs to be refinanced Sept/Oct 2009.      This year's MIS sales likely to be hit by 3 factors      1. By GS's own admission, MIS investments likely to lose money for investors (see forecasts for 98-03 plantation projects)   2. Severe reputational damage from Project Transform   3. Less need for tax effective investments due to current financial circumstances.      Still has considerable liabilities (maintanence and capital costs) for continuing projects not yet provisioned for.      If only money grew on them trees!      end quote       If others reaading this please bring upto speed ,I am basically a crayon butcher paper level.
