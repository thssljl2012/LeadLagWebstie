 A bid by auto-parts supplier Lear Corp. to amend its primary credit facility because of ongoing instability in the automotive industry is likely to succeed, an analyst said Wednesday.      The Southfield, Mich., company, which makes seating systems and electronic products, said Tuesday after the market closed that its liquidity position was strong, but it was still initiating renegotiations over its $980 million term loan and its $1.2 billion revolving credit facility.      At the end of December, Lear said it had $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents and had fully borrowed against the amounts in its $1.2 billion revolving credit facility.      "We believe that creditor approval is more likely than not," Deutsche Bank-North America analyst Rod Lache said in a client note.      But even with approval, challenges remain.      "Although we believe that Lear is more likely than not to avert a bankruptcy at this stage, and we believe that Lear's balance sheet can handle the $535 million cash burn, and $460 million of debt maturities that we expect in 2009/2010, the risk of bankruptcy is not insignificant," he said.      Lache has a "Sell" rating on the shares and a 75 cents price target.      The stock closed up 25 cents, or 14.2 percent, to $2.01 Tuesday. In the past 52 weeks, shares have traded between 75 cents and $34.57.
