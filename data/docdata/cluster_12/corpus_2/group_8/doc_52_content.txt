In a research note, it said many other European countries had significantly worse public debt to GDP ratios. JP Morgan also said the Government had 'significant capacity' to service a large increase in its debt.  On the costs of supporting the banks, JP Morgan said that though this would require more funding, it was likely to be 'costly rather than impossible'  The bank also said it saw value in the bonds of the six banks covered by the Government's guarantee scheme up to September 2010, while the bonds of AIB and Bank of Ireland also offered 'compelling value' in the period after the guarantee.
