That assumes that there is still something left, DR.

The paper reports that, "Three of Australia's largest banks have obtained long-term loans from the Future Fund as cash dried up from other sources." It happened in late March and early April of this year, just after Bear Stearns went belly up.   "The ANZ, Westpac and National Australia Bank (NAB) tapped funding for up to 10 years." Leaked documents showed that ANZ borrowed $500 million from the Fund. What NAB and Westpac borrowed were not disclosed.
