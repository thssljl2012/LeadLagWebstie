Based on yesterday's 8K, the March 1st deadline was extended to April 30th so unless they announce a R/S in-between then, which I doubt, nothing major bad should happen in-between then IMO, and that's assuming they don't successfully renegotiate the senior credit facility, though most viable corporations have been successful in re-negotiating their bonds of late. It's not like Bank of America is going out of business. Your input please.
