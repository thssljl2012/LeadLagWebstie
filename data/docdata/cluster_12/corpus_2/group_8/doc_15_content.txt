The banks are doing ok as witnessed by the story below, but I agree it's dumb to just keep cutting rates - how many people actually reduce their mortgage payments??? How much of the interest rate cut actually makes it's way into the economy???                Commonwealth Bank of Australia in profit surprise                         Article from:                              Font size:       Decrease        Increase          Email article:       Email         Print article:       Print         Submit comment:      Submit comment                   George Lekakis              February 03, 2009 12:00am                                                                              COMMONWEALTH Bank scrip may rebound this morning after the group last night issued a surprise profit upgrade to the market.     In a statement filed to the  ASX  after the bank's monthly board meeting in Sydney, CBA chief executive Ralph Norris revealed that the group's interim cash earnings would come in at around $2 billion.    While this guidance is 16 per cent down on the previous first half result, it is more than 20 per cent above analysts' consensus forecasts.    Under ASX rules, all listed companies are required to notify the market as soon as they become aware that near time profit performances may exceed consensus estimates by more than 10 per cent.     CBA  directors are believed to have arrived at that conclusion after the sharemarket closed yesterday.    Broking analysts said the disclosure was a positive for CBA amid a tide of grim news in the banking sector.    "The CBA has signalled it will deliver a result well above expectations and that's a positive for shareholders, but we note that there was no commentary on the dividend," said Stewart Oldfield of Baillieu Stockbroking.    "We still believe the banks will experience a very difficult trading environment in the second half."    While the cash result is yet to be finalised, Mr Norris said the CBA's performance had been driven by volume growth in key businesses.    "As customers look for stable financial institutions in these uncertain times, growth in deposit and credit demand has been strong," he said.    "The group remains focused on credit management and cost control."    Bottom line profit for the six months to the end of December - which includes non-cash items such as gains on the carrying value of assets - is expected to exceed $2.5 billion.    That is more than 9 per cent up on the December half in 2007, mainly because of a "post-tax gain of approximately $550 million on the acquisition of  Bankwest ".     However, the bank indicated that this benefit would be partly offset by a substantial fall in income from its funds management operations.     Mr Norris cautioned that the increasingly challenging environment made the outlook for the company "extremely difficult to predict".     CBA will release its full interim results on February 11.     The bank's scrip closed down 45c to $26.45.
