In a statement filed to the  ASX  after the bank's monthly board meeting in Sydney, CBA chief executive Ralph Norris revealed that the group's interim cash earnings would come in at around $2 billion.    While this guidance is 16 per cent down on the previous first half result, it is more than 20 per cent above analysts' consensus forecasts.    Under ASX rules, all listed companies are required to notify the market as soon as they become aware that near time profit performances may exceed consensus estimates by more than 10 per cent.     CBA  directors are believed to have arrived at that conclusion after the sharemarket closed yesterday.    Broking analysts said the disclosure was a positive for CBA amid a tide of grim news in the banking sector.    &amp;quot;The CBA has signalled it will deliver a result well above expectations and that's a positive for shareholders, but we note that there was no commentary on the dividend,&amp;quot; said Stewart Oldfield of Baillieu Stockbroking.    &amp;quot;We still believe the banks will experience a very difficult trading environment in the second half.&amp;quot;    While the cash result is yet to be finalised, Mr Norris said the CBA's performance had been driven by volume growth in key businesses.    &amp;quot;As customers look for stable financial institutions in these uncertain times, growth in deposit and credit demand has been strong,&amp;quot; he said.    &amp;quot;The group remains focused on credit management and cost control.&amp;quot;    Bottom line profit for the six months to the end of December - which includes non-cash items such as gains on the carrying value of assets - is expected to exceed $2.5 billion.    That is more than 9 per cent up on the December half in 2007, mainly because of a &amp;quot;post-tax gain of approximately $550 million on the acquisition of  Bankwest &amp;quot;.      However, the bank indicated that this benefit would be partly offset by a substantial fall in income from its funds management operations.      Mr Norris cautioned that the increasingly challenging environment made the outlook for the company &amp;quot;extremely difficult to predict&amp;quot;.      CBA will release its full interim results on February 11.      The bank's scrip closed down 45c to $26.45.                      I think the CBA's result is good but not truly indicative of where it is going into the future - the result is for December where the full effects of the rate cuts have not fully been put in.   A rate cut will have a lag from when the RBA announce and when the bank will pass that cut on.  December results would have the rate cuts from Sep, Oct and Nov factored in and only a couple of days worth of a Dec cut.   That said - CBA probably have a large fixed loan portfolio as well which is shielding some of the profit downturn - but no doubt this is sure to change.   I would be more worried about the second half of the 09 FY to be honest as the rate cuts (both known and forecast) will have its downward effect in the months Feb through to June.   CBA is big enough to shield a fair bit (especially when is starts cutting staff for cost cutting activities) but others I fear may not be as lucky.
