 COMMONWEALTH Bank and Westpac are losing customers following their multi-billion dollar regional bank acquisitions last year.      And smaller rivals, such as Bank of Queensland and Bendigo Bank, appear to be the beneficiaries.      CBA, which acquired Perth-based Bankwest for $2.1 billion in October, appears to be suffering the biggest customer exodus according to official data published by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.      The authority's monthly report on banking statistics shows that Bankwest's household deposits base fell $380 million to $14.07 billion in January.      The data suggests that the customer attrition rate has accelerated since December when Bankwest suffered a $163 million net outflow of deposits from household customers.      The big outflow of deposits is a concern for CBA chief Ralph Norris, who last month said that the integration of Bankwest was on track.      In fact, Mr Norris was so enamored by the performance of Bankwest that he boosted the carrying value of the acquisition in the interim financial accounts by more than $540 million.      However, if customers continue to evacuate Bankwest at the current rate, then CBA may be forced to review that decision and mark down the carrying value of the subsidiary in its full-year accounts.      Westpac is also facing a battle to hold on to customers at its recently acquired St George subsidiary.      St George's household deposit base fell $135 million in January to $36.8 billion.
