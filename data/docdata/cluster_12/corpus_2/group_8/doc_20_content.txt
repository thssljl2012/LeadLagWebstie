       &lt;&lt;Since this is not likely for at least a year and maybe more&gt;&gt;  They had $56 million in cash and securities at the end of 2008, of which $19.6 million (that is $22.6 million discounted by $3 million) are in ARS's, student loan paper guaranteed by the government, but not liquid at present. However, Bank of America has agreed with the SEC to make a "best effort" to buy back those ARS's from small business (SBA definition of small business is under 500 employees) by the end of the year.  So at year end, the company had $36.5 million in actual cash, a burn rate of $20-$22 million a year or $1.75 million a month. That would leave them with $33 million in actual cash today, or just over 18 months of cash.  The ARS's should be taken care of before then. There is also a clinical milestone set up in the contract with Nycomed, and I would suspect it is tied to the ITP trial, which could/should finish up later this year. Since it is clinical rather than regulatory, I suspect it is dependent upon the start of pivotal trials. That could happen late this year or early next year and I believe that will happen because I think the early data will prove out in the higher number of patients being treated now in the phase ll trial.  The company really has never been more solid from a financial position and has never been in a better position to achieve clinical milestones that could bring in payments and support a higher stock price.  Short term, I think the seller is still there, but hasn't been as willing to take less than .90 a share today. If he becomes willing, the stock will fall to whatever level he is willing to take. In my opinion, it is that simple.
