 Kohl's looks to be one of the benefactors of the retail upheaval once a recovery occurs as it snaps up Mervyns locations and continues to concentrate on inventory management, an analyst said Friday.      Late Thursday the department store operator said its fourth-quarter profit declined 18 percent to $1.10 per share, but the results still managed to top the $1.03 per-share estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.      Analysts' estimates typically exclude one-time items.      Menomonee Falls, Wis.-based Kohl's said it plans to gain market share during the year by expanding into former Mervyns locations and conveying its low-price message to consumers amid the recession.      The company nabbed five more Mervyns locations during the quarter, bringing its total to 36 stores, which should bode well for it during the second half of the year and into 2010, Bill Dreher Jr. of Deutsche Bank North America said in a client note.      "While management believes sales will benefit from the retail consolidation, we anticipate Kohl's will see a more significant increase in sales from market share up-for-grabs in the second half of 2009 and 2010 than management forecast," he added.      Dreher reaffirmed a "Buy" rating.      Citi Investment Research's Deborah Weinswing also thinks Kohl's stands to gain from industry consolidation, "both from the perspectives of topline/market share and real estate opportunities."      She was pleased that the company was able to better its gross margin rate through ongoing inventory efforts, reduced clearance levels and increased penetration of private and exclusive brands, explaining that the department store operator was the only one in her group to expand its gross margin rate during the quarter.      Weinswing also maintained a "Buy" rating and $42 price target.
