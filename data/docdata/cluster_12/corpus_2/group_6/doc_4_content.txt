That 121.8 million are already in the market - that is old news and Bank of America was a company that received a majority - and they have been selling at between 10 and 12 cents - accepting a 30% loss. This allowed Fleetwood to write off its debt with major lenders to allow them to be a going concern. Most sub penny pinks - have billions of shares and dilute until they are .0001 - and then reverse split and do it again - the difference is not only in the amount of shares - but the fact Fleetwood is an actual company - not just a storyline.
