 Well, I have never worked in the banking business but I have done business with both. I have actually liked doing business better with the larger national banks, such as JP Morgan Chase. I have had a few issues with Bank of America, so I will not do business with them. But, otherwise I have never had problems with the larger banks.     I enjoy doing business with my local bank also though, so it's really just your choice. Many of the smaller banks are being bought out by larger national banks anyway, as you probably know.
