 Very crass of them CG but in keeping with past performance don't you think?      Just a few observations for those following the legal developments in the windup of Storm:    I think you will find that CBA have appointed Korda Mentha to come in and grab the secured assets for the loan that Storm has failed to repay whilst Worrells Solvency and Forensic Accountants are the administrative receivers voluntarily appointed by Storm who are now responsible for the whole of the company's property and have a range of statutory powers such as the power to carry on or even transfer the business of the company, to enter into contracts and to borrow money.   They (W) will probably chair the creditors meeting to establish the extent to which creditors have claims on storm. I would not expect there to be much relevant information in that for past clients.      There is plenty of great advise on this thread for those trying to fight their way through this tragedy; all I can add as one who has been through a similar event is that your only long term hope for satisfaction rests with a well run class action.   We have already heard from professionals on this thread that Financial Planning is very heavily regulated. So use the regulations.                 My opinion; your call.
