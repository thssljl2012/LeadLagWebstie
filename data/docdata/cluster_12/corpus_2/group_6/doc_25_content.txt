 BAK Message Board Posts          Recs: 3              Wachovia on ALD/AFC from yesterday   Equity Research  Allied Capital Corporation  ALD: Violates Debt Covenant--Future Uncertain  Reopens Amendment Discussions With Lenders   DEBT COVENANT VIOLATED. ALD announced that, based on current  estimates of asset values as of December 31, it will be in violation of the 200%  asset coverage ratio required under its credit facility and outstanding private notes.  Additionally, the 200% asset coverage ratio is a mandate for all BDC/RICs under  the Investment Company Act of 1940.   NEGOTIATIONS WITH LENDERS UNDERWAY. ALD has reopened  discussions with its lenders in an effort to get a waiver on the 200% asset coverage  covenant. Failure to do so would result in an event of default, placing the company  solely in the control of creditors, which could ultimately lead to bankruptcy.  Moreover, under the Investment Company Act, violation of the 200% asset  coverage ratio would preclude ALD from incurring additional indebtedness.   ASSET SALES UNSUCCESSFUL. Following this disclosure, the future of ALD  is solely dependent on its lenders. ALDs primary lender on its credit facility is  Bank of America with others being BB&amp;T, Morgan Stanley, and PNC. It is not  clear who the owners of ALDs private notes are. We understand that ALD had  been working to sell assets in an effort to deleverage. Clearly, based on this  announcement, the company was unsuccessful in this endeavor. On balance, we  believe this is due to a lack of liquidity in the marketplace, a rapid decline in the  value of assets worldwide, and a high default rate among the companys assets.   FUTURE UNCERTAIN. At this juncture, it is difficult to predict with any degree  of confidence what ALDs lenders will do. On the one hand, while ALD is in  technical default, its lenders could stand to recuperate less capital if they were to  force the company into bankruptcy. Rather than liquidate the company, we believe  it likely that the lenders will force ALD to terminate all dividend payments and  loan originations and provide the company with a timetable to reduce leverage. In  any event, ALDs future as a going concern is very much uncertain.  Valuation Range: $1 to $2  Our twelve-month valuation range is $1-2, which is reflective of the significant near  term funding challenges facing the company. Should ALD be successful in its  negotiations with lenders, there could be some upside to our valuation range. Risks to  our valuation range include a failure of the company to resolve its funding issues, a  prolonged period of capital markets illiquidity and/or a substantial deterioration in  credit quality.  Investment Thesis:  We rate shares of ALD Market Perform. While ALD shares appear undervalued based  on traditional metrics, the company's uncertain funding profile and deteriorating  portfolio prevents us from getting more constructive with our rating.
