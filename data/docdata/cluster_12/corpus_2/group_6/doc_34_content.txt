Indian economy has grown primarily because of service sector. Do you seriously believe Indian economy is immune to global events?                      Well thats what the financial results of Indian companies showing.  Anyone in US financial sector can tell how the last quarter was for US Companies and compare it with Indian companies. SBI VS Citibank compare it.     Specifically Indian financial sector is strong. With Inflation coming down, and another cut in petrol prices there would be further cut in interest rates, the economy would be much better.
