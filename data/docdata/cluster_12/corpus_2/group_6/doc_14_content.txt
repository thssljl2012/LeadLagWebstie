         Never too early...   http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/property_and_mortgage...   BC Partners, Foxtons's owner, has conceded that its decision to buy the company from Jon Hunt, the property magnate, for 360 million just before the credit crunch hit was a mistake.   It said yesterday that Foxtons breached performance terms set by its lenders, Bank of America and the Japanese bank Mizuho, last month, adding that it would not put more cash into the business unless lenders agreed to write off some of their 260 million debt.   Foxtons' fate is in the hands of its banks. BC Partners will continue to manage the estate agency until the banks decide whether to take control.
