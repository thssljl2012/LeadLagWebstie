          Warning: This post has HYP and PP related elements.  Ive posted a link to  it on the HYP strategy board.    I was motivated to write this because of all the recent posts, mainly from   LTBHers, about feelings of panic due to capital losses and regrets that stocks   were not sold earlier to provide cash for the upcoming bargains.  My approach is   largely LTBH and I too have suffered bouts of panic.  So I reviewed my strategy,   and that helped me reach some decisions about what to do  I thought it might   help others if I outlined my thought processes.    I believe to invest successfully over the long-term there are a few basics you   should follow.  Amongst these are the following:    1. Be clear on your objectives.  Set these taking account of the level of   risk you are prepared to take.   2. Formulate a strategy to achieve your objectives (and document it).    3. Make sure you have the ability to implement your strategy, taking account   of your strengths, weaknesses, emotional characteristics and any other factors   you believe to be important.  4. Implement the strategy and stick to it, unless the information on which   that strategy is based changes or your objectives change.    The bit thats most relevant to this post is sticking to the strategy unless   there is new information.  If there is new information, I will review my strategy   and change it if appropriate.  So I guess a key question is  What new   information is there that might affect my strategy?      As an example here are my objectives:  1. Reasonably reliable and growing income with low to moderate risk levels.    Generating sufficient income for me (and my wife) to live on for the rest of our   lives.  2. To have an emergency resource to cover unlikely but possible   circumstances (such as a major drop in income)  3. To provide for some extras and luxuries  4. Not to have to spend more than two or three days a month on investment   activity, maybe less  5. Have some fun in the process of achieving these objectives.    And here is my strategy.  I have a three part strategy to meet my five objectives:    1. HYP, to generate the income I need to live on  This part of my strategy   requires very little attention. Ive implemented an HY Portfolio based on PYADs   well documented principles  Large Cap, good divi history and cover, limited   debt, diversified across 15-20 sectors up to 30 shares.  This portfolio is   designed to generate 25% more income than I need for normal living expenses.     This is basically a LTBH portfolio that I can largely leave and forget (corporate   action being the main exception  a stock market crash is not an exception).    This portfolio is complete and I am living off the income now.    There has been much discussion on the HYP strategy board about capital protection   but this is largely irrelevant as for me the strategy is all about revenue   generation  do I have enough to live on?  That is about to be severely tested as   we move into recession  just how well will dividends hold up over the next few   years?      Should I have reduced my HYP shareholdings and gone into cash? I dont believe   so.  To have done so would have meant abandoning my strategy and I did not have  any information to persuade me that my strategy was wrong.  There was no new   information that impacts my HYP strategy.  The possibility of a stock market   crash was a consideration in formulating the strategy.  Are there elements of   this crash that mean I should change my strategy?  I am as yet unconvinced of   that so the strategy stands.     So in summary I have a HY strategy which is currently being tested but it hasnt   failed (as yet anyway).  And, as I dont think its broke Im not going to fix   it.  I may adjust it a bit e.g. any additions to the portfolio will be even more   rigorously assessed with regard to levels of debt, but it fundamentally stays in   place as designed.    2. Emergency Funds, just in case  This part of my strategy hardly requires   any attention at all. I have enough cash in NS&amp;amp;amp;I index linked certificates to see   me through a situation where my dividend income is clobbered by significantly   more than 25%.  These certificates have been bought monthly for the last 36   months and each months investment represents 50% of my needed monthly income.    So I can live for 3 years with a 50% drop in my required dividend income from the   HYP.  If I dont need the money when a certificate matures (after 3 years) I   reinvest it thus maintaining an emergency fund growing faster than inflation.     3. Higher Return Portfolio, for lifes little luxuries  This element of my   strategy requires at least two days a month to monitor events and company   information. It is higher risk and (if all goes well) should deliver higher   returns.  I use funds I can afford to lose and invest in a range of companies   (with an increasing tendency towards small caps) that I can get to know about and   enjoy following.  This element represents about 20-25% of my total investments.    Here I am interested in returns (dividend and capital growth).  This is a trading   portfolio, but to meet my objective of only spending two or three days a month on   my investments my selections are nearly all LTBH.  My biggest holding by far,   representing just under 40% of this portfolio, is Indigo Vision (IND).  I expect   this share to multi-bag over the next few years and will hold until either it   does or the information about the company changes in unexpected (to me) ways.    The rest of this portfolio is as follows:    Indigo Vision (IND)  38%  Gladstone(GLD)   8%  Chieftain (CFT)   6%  Fayrewood (FYR)   5%  Shell (RDSB)   5%  James Latham (LTHM)  4%  Barclays (BARC)   4%  Keller (KLR)   4%  NCipher (NCH)   4%  Aminex (AEX)   4%  Walker Greenbank (WGB)         3%  Hogg Robinson (HRG)  3%  Prudential (PRU)  2%  Touchstone (TSE)  2%  OMG (OMG)   2%  BHP Billiton (BLT)  2%  TMN (TMN)   2%  Royal Bask of Scotland (RBS) 2%  Nokia (NOK)   2%    I currently hold too many shares in this portfolio and will prune them somewhat   in the coming months; but Gladstone, Chieftain and NCipher are all in the process   of being acquired for cash and Fayrewood should also soon turn into cash, so its   not quite as bad as it looks, though still too many to monitor (to keep activity   below 3 days a month).    This portfolio has lost just under 40% in the past 12 months, somewhat of a   disaster.  Should I have liquidated some or all of this portfolio?  Hindsight   clearly says yes but that would require me to time the market both out and in,   and that means I have to spot the need to get out before the market does and time   the entry back in before the market does.  I dont have faith in my ability to   beat the market in this way so I will stay pretty much fully invested and see how   the returns develop.  If I prove to myself I cant stock pick that will be new   information and Ill change this part of the strategy accordingly.    So whats my point in all this?    Ive reviewed my strategies and the   information I have collected as the credit crunch has developed does not affect   my strategy in any significant way.  I am more wary of companies with high levels   of debt and I am much more wary of financial stocks (too much uncertainty) but   the basic strategy stands.  For those that can consistently recognise when   markets are fundamentally changing, before this is reflected in market prices, I   take my hat off to you (ee is one who has clearly called this market broadly   right, although even he admits he got it wrong, unfortunately  this was by not   being negative enough about the situation :(  But I cant, so I formulate my   strategies accordingly and that leads me to a LTBH approach.  This in turn means   I dont try and time the market but attempt to base any trading on company   fundamentals.  So my loss of capital hurts but I am still convinced my strategy   is right for me, so I now panic less and look forward to recovery, which will   come  I just dont know when.    Following these strategies I have to accept that Im likely to suffer when the   market turns down, and the harder the fall the more I get hurt (and I am in   considerable pain right now) but as long as I believe the market will recover and   my selections will provide a long-term return greater than cash, Ill stick with   shares.  If these beliefs are shattered Ill shift into cash, gilts and similar   safe investments, lick my wounds and look for something to do with those 3 extra   days a month Ive now got.  But Im a long way from doing that today. Thinking   through my strategies has helped me conquer my panic  I still think they are   right (for me) and I will continue to follow them.  But Im willing to learn so   if anyone has any suggestions to improve my strategy Im more than happy to   listen and learn (as I have been doing on this board for a number of years now).    In summary I believe a key to successful investing is be clear about your   objectives, formulate your strategy and stick to it unless and until you have   information that makes you believe things have changed.  If that happens   reformulate your strategies based on what you perceive to be the new reality.  My   strategies were formed on the basis there have been crashes before and that there   will be crashes again, so the fact of a crash is not in itself new information   and so my strategies stand, albeit with significantly less capital than a year   ago.    Is it different this time  possibly, but until I have reliable information that   it is Im not changing my strategy!    Oh, I forget to mention my other key strategy, which involves mutilating rabbits,   crossing fingers, picking white heather and obtaining genetically manipulated   clover ;)      Whatever your strategy I wish you lots of luck and the achievement of your   objectives.
