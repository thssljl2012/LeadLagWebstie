         Associations  Salmond leader of the SNP was employed by RBS in the 1980-1987 as an economist, he was an expert on the Oil Industry.  Treasury advisory lawyer Nigel Boardman of Slaughter &amp;amp;amp; May, who was involved on the Government&amp;#039;s bailout exercise, is the son of the Late Lord Boardman one time Chairman of NatWest. James Leigh-Pemberton of Credit Suisse also mentioned in the Daily Telegraph article is the son of the former Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton (now Lord Kingsdown) who was also a former Chairman of NatWest. Credit Suisse working for HMG looked the banks&amp;#039; own schemes for re-capitalisation and only found in favour of Barclays. Both men are highly regarded in their professional spheres.  Paul Myners the Government&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;City Minister&amp;#039;, and apparently no friend of Fred, was a banker way back with Rothschilds where he was a Director and was later employed at high level by NatWest and Gartmore, he was also Chairman of M &amp;amp;amp; S up to 2006 during a period when it hardly covered itself in glory performance-wise. Like a lot of Labour &amp;#039;Capitalists&amp;#039; he is no doubt well endowed with wordly goods far beyond what we can aspire to in this world.  If the UK banks require additional capital great, it ensures their survival, but rounded off figures like 20 billion for RBS smacks of a back of a used envelope exercise by the FSA, rounded well up to ensure the creators of the sums do not look silly later.  Time will tell on what impact the bailout has achieved and whether the major institutional shareholders of RBS stump up for the shares on offer to avoid their current holdings being diluted. A massive overhang of HMG shares scheduled for eventual sale in RBS for some time to come will have a very depressivve effect on the share price even if profits perk up.
