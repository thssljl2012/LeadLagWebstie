We are all being put through the grinder at the moment.   I bought a few GPT just a couple of days before their trading halt.    Noticed today that CBA and Macquarie choose to update with their substational notices. Both down significantly.....   mmmm.... CBA is probably their banker, and i know Macquarie is handling the capital raising.      So much for Chinese walls between their funds management and banking/advisory departments.
