         I am starting to feel bullish again. I am looking to get some money invested in shares. I feel that sooner or later there is going to be some takeover activity and I want to get in while prices are depressed. I realise that we have a long recession looming but from past experience its probably to get in a bit sooner rather than a bit later. Reading through press reports and board rumours some companies that have been mentioned are:-    Prudential    Aviva (Chinese interest?)    Barclays    Sainsburys (KKR?)     I would be grateful if anyone could give opinions on these and any other suggestions would be welcomed.   Cheers
