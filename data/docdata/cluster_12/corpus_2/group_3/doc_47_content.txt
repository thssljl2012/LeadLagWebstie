          Recently, in my job, I&amp;amp;#039;ve been working on notifying shareholders of St. George Bank, of the deadline for the vote on the proposed merger of their company and Westpac.&amp;amp;nbsp; As a shareholder notification company, this is our bread and butter, however something I noticed was this:  The deadline for the proxie forms (The posted forms... or online and faxed.) is 11 of November at noon, Eastern Australian Time.  Daylight savings means it&amp;amp;#039;s an hour ahead, so it&amp;amp;#039;s 11 hour, on the 11th day, of the 11th month.  Anyone else find that creepy? A.G.
