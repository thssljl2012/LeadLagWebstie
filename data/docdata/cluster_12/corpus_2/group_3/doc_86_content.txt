         Hi everyone, just wondering if anyone has any experience using E*trade (the Power E*trade platform/subscription in particular). I&amp;#039;m using Barclays BARX with level 2 at the moment and it is driving me insane - constantly unavailable just at the moment you want it to be.  I&amp;#039;ve done some reading of the boards here and of those platforms offering DMA, iDealing and interactive broker appear to come recommended. But I&amp;#039;m not going to qualify for the professional level with idealing and a couple of telephone messages have gone unanswered with interactive broker, so I&amp;#039;m looking at alternatives.  Thanks in advance for any help/comments.  Bennn
