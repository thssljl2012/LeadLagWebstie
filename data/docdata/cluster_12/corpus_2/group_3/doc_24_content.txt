 IOC Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              strange action today   What a fake out - at least so far today. I was expecting another of those great &amp;#039;buying opportunities&amp;#039;. Can&amp;#039;t believe IOC&amp;#039;s relative strength is due to this news that a couple of PNG banks are giving them a credit line. This seems like more of a gesture of support. Not clear that any money has, or will, exchange hands.  Maybe this is a sign that the PNG government is standing behind IOC? But how strong are the government&amp;#039;s finances? Or maybe these banks know something about IOC&amp;#039;s off-take agreement negotations?    On another note, anybody thinking of selling IOC for the tax loss?  If we were down big today, I was thinking of buying share equal to my current position, and then waiting a month to sell my original shares for the tax loss. Can&amp;#039;t get used to having a 40% loss on IOC, after having a 70% gain.       http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/interoil-announces-575-million-working/story.aspx?guid=%7B0C3FBAEA-F086-4711-80B0-EF9B6DAF66D4%7D&amp;amp;dist=hppr     InterOil Announces $57.5 Million Working Capital Loan Facility With Banks in Papua New Guinea    IOC 10.66, +0.41, +4.0%) (POMSoX:IOC), today announced that it has secured a 150 million Kina (US$57.5 million) revolving working capital facility for its wholesale and retail petroleum products distribution business in Papua New Guinea from two of that country&amp;#039;s leading financial institutions, Bank of South Pacific Limited and Westpac Bank PNG Limited.   &amp;quot;We are pleased to have established this facility which will provide increased security for our working capital requirements and evidences the strong relationships and presence maintained by InterOil in Papua New Guinea,&amp;quot; stated Mr. Collin Visaggio, Chief Financial Officer.
