 I&amp;#039;ve seen a job advert that takes my fancy. It working for Barclays in their Manchester contact centre as a collector. I currently work for the tax office (in a call centre), but after yet another meeting about new practices which basically mean more working time restrictions and the fact that customer service has finally gone out the window and flown away forever, I&amp;#039;ve had enough.    Does anyone have any experience working for barclays? anyone have experience in collections?    Any information would be welcomed.    Many thanks.
