The latest insecurities (justifiably, so)  &amp;amp;quot;Dubai, Mumbai, Shanghai or Goodbye&amp;amp;quot; - is the financial world&amp;#039;s attempt to communicate that they don&amp;#039;t trust Wall Street/Western Banking...            Dubai is picking up the mantle of the financial capital of the world, as global banking sectors London and New York continue to fade on the back of the global credit crises.

Lehman Brothers on Tuesday became the latest investment bank moving one of its most senior positions to the UAE. Philip Lynch, the banks co-head of equities for Europe and the Middle East, will be relocating to Dubai after serving more than two decades in London.      The US investment bank, which has axed over 6,000 staff in the last nine months, said the move was aimed at serving the growing needs of clients in the Gulf region and the wider Middle East.

The relocation of roles from London and New York to Dubai, and to a lesser extent Mumbai and Shanghai, reflects the reshaping of global opportunities for investment banks.      With a surge in oil revenue, rapidly rising infrastructure needs, and the emergence of sovereign wealth funds at the head of M&amp;amp;amp;A activity, the Middle East and Asia have become crucial for global investment banks looking to remain profitable.         http://neveryetmelted.com/?p=3871          -------------------------      The USA and UK banks and investing avenues will have to grow from this Neo-Conservative-Money-Grab mentality, but they will rise, for the better... we hope.
