 SAKON     -- To Make S60 Developing Easier!        SAKON is a UI library designed for S60 v3, and is aimed to make developing easier. By providing new stock controls, dialogs , and auto-layout container, UI development will become an easy job. Some controls have the same name as those peers in UIQ3, such as BuildingBlock. Sakon also uses Building Block to layout.      Stock Controls in V1.0.1   -- Choice List   -- Check Box   -- Slider   -- Building Block   -- Simple Dialog   -- Container   -- Scrollable Container (Debuging)      All of the controls have skinned background automatically, and the can be created in two ways: from code or from resource file. The simple dialog is really simple currently, for it&amp;#039;s not scrollable yet, and can have at most one page. But it does already surpport CBA and menu.       At the end, it is still under development. More other usefull stock controls , like table, will be supported.
