 Is there any indication of what will happen to the existing Albion Street Barclays when they presumably move down Albion Street to the new Barclays bank at the old Lloyds TSB at West Riding House when it opens? I guess it could make quite a big new retail unit potentially in combination with the Slater Menswear above?
