 A Barclays Capital guy ought to know...  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/business/13europe.htm...     &amp;quot;There was even talk of halting trading on world exchanges until the new measures are promulgated and digested by market participants.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Hans-Jrg Rudloff, the chairman of Barclays Capital, said closing world financial markets for two or three days might provide time needed to work out solutions to the global banking crisis, Bloomberg News reported, citing an interview with the Swiss newspaper Sonntag.  In the interview, Mr. Rudloff called the current crisis probably worse than the stock market crash of 1929.  The Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, mused publicly about a market shutdown on Friday in Washington, but later retracted his statement.&amp;quot;
