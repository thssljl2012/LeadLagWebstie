AIG Software opens Asian hub in KL By Zaidi Isham Ismail Published: 2008/09/05   AIG Software International JV Sdn Bhd, part of insurance giant American International Group Inc (AIG), has opened its Asian hub in Kuala Lumpur to offer travel help to policyholders.  AIG Software general manager for Southeast Asia Mark Pavlides said policyholders who face emergencies while travelling in the region can turn to AIG Travel Assist.  These include loss of passports or sickness.  Existing or new AIG customers who plan to go on holiday can also buy the travel assist product for as low as RM6 for domestic holidays or an annual package of up to RM300 per policy depending on holiday destination and length of stay.  &amp;amp;quot;The group spent US$2 million (RM6.86 million) for this centre and we plan to expand to 100 employees by year-end,&amp;amp;quot; said Pavlides in Selangor yesterday.  The AIG Travel Assist was launched by Tourism Minister Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said.  The newly-established Kuala Lumpur centre will work with AIG Travel Assist&amp;#039;s other four existing international assistance centres, of which two are in North America and one each in South America and Europe.  Meanwhile, Azalina said the Malaysian Association of Tour and Travel Agents (Matta) travel fair should promote local destinations apart from those abroad.  &amp;amp;quot;Matta should go on roadshows nationwide and promote local tourists destinations,&amp;amp;quot; said Azalina.  She added that there has been a 12.5 per cent jump in tourist arrivals in August from the previous month, of which 70 per cent are from European countries such as the UK, Germany and France compared with Middle Eastern tourists.  &amp;amp;quot;The government is working hard by extending the opening hours at some shopping complexes such as the Pavillion to 12 midnight to attract tourists from emerging markets such as India and China,&amp;amp;quot; said Azalina.
