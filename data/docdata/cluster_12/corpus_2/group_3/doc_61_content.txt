Think what country/currency you think would be best. Then select or reject sectors (type of industry/commerce) you think will do best over the coming 2-3 years. From those sectors compare individual companies for track record, financial stregnth, management qualities etc. Invest quarter or half your total funds in those companies now and see how things go before investing more. This is assuming you have SPARE cash (now and for the next couple of years) and that you will not need that money for any other more important demands like housing, childrens educatiion, holidays etc. Sectors that would appear to be favoured are Telecoms, Oil (Conoco, Shell,BP, Anadarko), Pharms,\Mining maybe even one of the strong banks like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JP Morgan, Barclays, Lloyds, HSBC.   Establish a diversified portflio of 6 or so shares. Questions, further help, on  http://www.shareworld.co.uk
