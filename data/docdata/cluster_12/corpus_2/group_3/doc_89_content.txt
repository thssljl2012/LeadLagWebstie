           Quoting  SunriseValley  ( Reply 8 ):  Are there any significant individual shareholdings in  BA , say 5% or more of the outstanding shares?       Even if almost nobody knows that, Iberia is the first shareholder of British Airways with a 10% of the capital. Iberia bought this stake through call options (options to buy) last summer to force  BA  to accept a merger, and now Iberia already has about an 8% of  BA , with an extra 2% of the capital in call options, and to be converted into shares soon.       The second shareholder is Standard Life with about a 9%, Barclays (~7%), Anvescap (~6,5%), and AXA (~5%). Invesco, who was the first shareholder (12%) has been selling its stake in the last months, and now I cannot remember, but I think it has a 5% or less.
