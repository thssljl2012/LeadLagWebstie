Assuming that this amount is equitably divided among the teams, is it enough to raise the salary cap to the level you suggest? Perhaps if the current cap stands at 2.4, I forget the miniscule amount. Let's not forget that SUM is another business entity and will take a fair portion of the revenue for operating costs and profit distribution among its shareholders.        You'll have to wait for the current CBA to conclude before you'll see the cap raised, especially considering that the league just trimmed 4 roster slots and the reserve league to cut operating costs.
