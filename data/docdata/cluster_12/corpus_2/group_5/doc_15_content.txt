And, as Turnbull said, we are one of the few countries where the actions of the govt have made things worse.                      Whilst I am not enamoured with many of the government&amp;#039;s attempts to address the economic situation, I cannot see how it can be seen to be to blame for Allco, ABC and Centro. All of those businesses went on a debt-fuelled spending binge well before Rudd and Co got in. Similarly, the CBA and other banks got into their situation during the last government.      What do you reckon the government could have done to avoid these collapses and the banks&amp;#039; exposure?
