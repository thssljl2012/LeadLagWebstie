         I thought it might be of interest to look at the bank holdings of Capital Income Builder, a very large US-based mutual fund which is very conservatively run and which strives to produce above-average income from stocks with a history of increasing dividends.  The following is drawn from its latest available tabulation, which is as of 30 September of this year.  The figures are in $ mn.  Santander ..............................................  773.4 HSBC  ....................................................  580.1 Bank of America  ...................................  467.3 JPMorgan  ..............................................   314.3 Royal Bank of Canada  ..........................  204.5 Citigroup  ...............................................  169.2 Lloyds  ...................................................    32.0  I could not discover any holdings of Barclays, Deutsche Bank, or Royal Bank of Scotland.  Considering that the fund&amp;#039;s emphasis is on above average and increasing income, the fact that Lloyds is held while RBC and BARC are not is an endorsement, but the size of the holding does not correspond to the high opinion of the likes of Jimsusan.  ghu
