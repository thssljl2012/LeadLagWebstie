Be careful with the sharesave options, if you decide to take part, spread your risk. Purchase an equivalent amount every month into an all-share tracker to safe guard your investment. I know I will have just wasted 2 mins of my time writing this - but by purchasing ever more stock in RBS, they are effctively passing further business risk over to the employees who partake in the scheme.       FYI    From the FT website;    BoA shelves plans for sale of China Construction Bank stake    Implications for RBS (Reduce TP 18p)    The sale of RBS insurance business, suggested to be worth &amp;pound;7bn at the time of the first rights issue in April, has stalled. The BoA announcement suggests RBS may also find selling its &amp;pound;1.3bn stake in Bank of China difficult.     The FT reports Bank of America has shelved a $3bn (&amp;#128;2.1bn) sale of China Construction Bank stock following objections from Beijing, igniting fears that some cash-strapped overseas banks could struggle to offload their lucrative holdings in the country&amp;#146;s banks. RBS holds a 4.3 per cent stake in Bank of China that could raise more than &amp;pound;1.3bn ($2bn) if sold after the lock-in period expires this month, the original cost was &amp;pound;800m.     VALUATION AND RECOMMENDATION &amp;#150; The sale of the BoC stake might be perceived as a &amp;quot;catalyst&amp;quot; for RBS. However, even if it does sell the stake, we disagree that this is central to the investment case. We think the main driver of the share price will be falling profitability and the &amp;pound;1.7 trillion balance sheet is likely to shrink for the next few years. Rec is reduce TP 18p.
