So in order to win this prize we are running a virtual stock market game.  You will have   $ 10,000   available to buy shares on Thursday 11th December.    Share prices are to be obtained from your daily newspapers  eg, Melbourne  Herald Sun.  Newspapers report the last trade price on the ASX from the previous day so use that as an indicator when compiling your shares.     So check out Thursday&amp;#039;s paper and work out your shares and post them up!    For example     as at 8/12/08 Herald Sun  (In todays paper 09/12/08)     CBA  $ 32.80 by 240 shares = $ 7,872.00   NAB  $ 20.96 by 101 shares = $ 2,116.96                                  Total - $ 9988.96      The competition will run for just under two weeks and shares can be traded once during the allotted time but you must nominate the price you are buying it at and the sell price.    The strongest monetary performance wins the book.  If some posters have the same shares listed as another poster then the earliest post time will come into play.    Good luck to all!                            Where is the link?  I&amp;#039;ll forgo the prize even if I win!!
