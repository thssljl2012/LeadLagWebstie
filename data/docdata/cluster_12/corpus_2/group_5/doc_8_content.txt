Co lowers guidance primarily due to lower sales across its end markets, changes in product mix, restructuring charges and potential impairment charges. As a result of continued deterioration in business conditions, AATI will expand its cost reduction initiatives and reduce its workforce by ~12% by the end of December 2008. This reduction is in response to the current macroeconomic environment and is one of several broad-based cost cutting initiatives the co is pursuing. The resulting annual cost savings are expected to be between $4.0-5.0 mln. AATI expects to incur an initial restructuring charge of ~$0.8-$1.2 mln, related to costs associated with employee severance and restructuring expenses. Additionally, the co will be performing an impairment analysis of its goodwill and intangible assets of ~$17.0 mln in Q4 as several indicators have been identified that suggest that a more than temporary impairment might exist at this time. 5:56PM AATI lowers Q4 revs to ~$18 mln vs $19.4 mln consensus : 5:03PM Chartered Semi lowers Q4 revs and EPS guidance (CHRT) 1.20 -0.05 : Co lowers Q4 EPS to ($0.34)-(0.28) vs $0.21 consensus, down from ($0.25)-(0.21), lowered revs to $377-386 mln vs $419.6 mln consensus, down from $350-360 mln. Co "As the quarter is progressing, we are seeing some of our customers postponing their deliveries due to, what we believe are, weaker market conditions and their intent to keep inventories low. We are therefore revising our outlook for the fourth quarter. Due to the uncertain business environment that continues to cloud our business visibility, we are aggressively identifying additional areas for cost reduction in addition to those that are being implemented currently." 4:34PM TrimTabs estimates all equity mutual funds post outflow of $2.8 billion in week ended Wednesday, December 10th : TrimTabs Investment Research estimates that all equity mutual funds posted an outflow of $2.8 billion in the week ended Wednesday, December 10, versus an outflow of $12.1 billion in the previous week.

Ongoing economic weakness and uncertainty surrounding a bailout for automakers weakened equities, while commodities advanced on rising oil prices and a weaker dollar. The U.S. House of Representatives approved yesterday a $14 billion plan to aid Ford (F 2.90, -0.35), General Motors (GM 4.12, -0.48), and Chrysler, but the plan is encountering resistance in the Senate. Failure to secure Senate support will prolong the process of getting automakers funds, leaving them to continue burning through cash. Cash burn has been problematic for automakers as they contend with softer sales. Sales are expected to remain pressured as consumers battle job losses. Initial jobless claims for the week ended December 6 increased 58,000 to 573,000. Continuing claims increased to 4.43 million from 4.09 million. Both levels were worse than expected and are similar to what are typically seen in recessions. In other economic data, the October trade deficit climbed to $57.2 billion from $56.6 billion. According to the data, exports dropped significantly. Exports had been a point of notable strength earlier this year, yet with weakness spreading overseas economic activity will encounter further pressure in the fourth quarter. Exports have also been challenged by a strengthening dollar, which makes dollar-denominated goods more expensive to foreign buyers. However, the dollar dipped nearly 2% this session, giving way to gains in commodities. In turn, the CRB Commodity Index advanced 4.3% this session. However, crude was the real gainer, climbing more than 12% for a time. It finished with an advance closer to 9%, around $47.40 per barrel. Oil's gains come on the belief that OPEC will cut production when it meets December 17 as the cartel aims to realign supply with demand. Softer demand has the International Energy Agency forecasting a drop in global oil demand for 2008, which would be the first time demand has shrunk in 25 years. Assuming economic conditions improve, the IEA expects a slight increase in demand in the back half of 2009. Oil's advance made energy (-0.4%) a strong performer for much of the session. It gained more than 3% before finishing lower. Financials (-8.5%) were the worst performers of the session, led lower by the likes of Bank of America (BAC 14.91, -1.78) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 29.94, -3.58). Financials continue to encounter pressure as investors assess the sector's earnings prospects. Meanwhile, wholesaler Costco (COST 52.06, -1.63) announced better-than-expected earnings per share results for the latest quarter, and Dow component Procter &amp; Gamble (PG 58.58, -0.54) confirmed its second quarter and fiscal 2009 outlook. Eli Lilly (LLY 35.62, +0.61) reaffirmed its outlook for fiscal 2008, and issued upside guidance for fiscal 2009. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK 36.08, +0.64) traded higher after receiving unanimous approval from the FDA for the company to market Advair for adult use. Its strength, along with Lilly's, helped the health care sector (+0.2%) outperform. Health care was the only sector to close higher.DJ30 -196.33 NASDAQ -57.60 SP500 -25.65 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 676/2.07 bln/2082 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 709/1.47 bln/2420 1:06PM Actel confirms fourth quarter 2008 guidance (ACTL) 10.76 -0.01 : Co releases its business update for Q4 of fiscal 2008, which is unchanged from previous guidance: Co believes that fourth quarter 2008 revenues will be flat to down four percent sequentially (current consensus is for Q4 revs down ~2.1%).
