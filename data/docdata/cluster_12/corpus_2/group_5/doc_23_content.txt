         Hi Fools,  At the Cemex website they mention they are paying dividends in the form of stock shares and if investors have ownership of ADR's, they can order Citibank to convert them into full or partial cash.  A few questions:  The Cemex website last mentions June 2008 stock dividends, and nothing more recent, are they continuing to give dividends?  Is Citibank in some form still performing this service for investors, or is some other entity taking this over?    Cemex states that the Mexican government won't tax the stock dividends, but that the U.S. government taxes them as income gains.  Does this mean that even the non-cashed shares are treated as  paid out dividends (and therefore taxable at 15%), or even as short term capital gains (at 25-35%)?  Looking at the debt to equity ratios for Cemex for the latest quarter on Morningstar, shows it to be 0.49.  What other debt would make the company's survival in jeopardy?  Thanks! -Grey
