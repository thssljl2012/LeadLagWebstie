Lolly, If there is no NSS situation, then I am confident the company&amp;#039;s fundamentals will eventually come through. They will gradually use improving cash flow to retire the RME shares, and by May 2009 we&amp;#039;ll see 400M shares outstanding and $10M in earnings, or EPS of 2.5 cents (just about the current share price). In 2010, we&amp;#039;ll see 200M shares and $20M in earnings, or 10 cents EPS (a 4-bagger at a P/E of 1!). If there IS a NSS situation, and if it is as big as I believe (well over 200M), then this could get very explosive. Scenario A takes more time than Scenario B. But they both make me a ton of $$. But nobody is trying to force you to buy. You can just walk away. Seriously, Citibank might be a better investment for you. Wadi Rum
