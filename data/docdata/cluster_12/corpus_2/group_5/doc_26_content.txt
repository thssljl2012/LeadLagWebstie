Exactly where you said.      The owners pockets to offset operating loses.      When CBA negotiations start SUM will have nothing to do with it.   It will be team operating costs. Profit/loss statements.      SUM was vital with regards to attracting investors a few years back. Without the SUM revenue safety net I shiver to think where the league might be right now.
