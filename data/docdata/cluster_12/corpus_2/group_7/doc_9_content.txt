         Patmcgee3   I'm interested in seeing how the likes of CBA, NAB , St George fare as well. Westpac I'm sure has it's fingers in the cds/cdo pie.   Here's a few links. Remember too that Australia first tier banks are all government guaranteed. Seemed pointless to me at the time because no Australian bank was at risk of collapse but Krudd wanted to be seen as the new boy doing what was good for Australia.     CBA - appears ok. Under pressure from the collapse of Storm Financial. Twelve billion in cash and assets.   http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific_busin...   NAB - Seems sound enough although getting jittery about its UK exposure. Looks as though it will dump some of it's UK assets.   http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssBanks/idUSSYD341904200901...   St George. Merger talks with Westpac last year. Don't know much about it except it's Perth based and a big home lender. Mortgage market over there is not under pressure from bad loans.  Westpac. Not sure about CDS/CDO exposure. CDS's should be ok providing the risk is in Australia. Still making good profits. This link is interesting.   http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssFinancialServicesAndRealE...   This is another link worth reading. All four big banks CBA, Westpac etc retain their AA rating.   http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/business/story/0,28124,...   With all banks government guaranteed can't see much of a problem all in all.  Cheers Harmy
