     The NBA is set to borrow $175 million Feb. 26, marking one of the first league financings since the implosion of the credit markets last fall.      The money, which will be available to 15 teams, supplements an existing $1.7 billion leaguewide credit facility that uses the NBA's media contracts as   collateral to secure loans for the clubs. The NBA surveyed its teams, and 15 responded they would like to tap into the new borrowing.      While the league said it is pleased to borrow in an extremely illiquid credit market, the deal came at a cost, with interest rates up to 8.27 percent,   hammering home the notion that the era of cheap money in sports is over. The 15 teams can use the money for any purpose, but covering operating losses may be   high on the list.      "In this economic environment, it's tremendous that the league can place such a facility," said Alex Martins, chief operating officer of the   Orlando Magic, which plans to borrow from the new debt. "It certainly helps us bridge the time period between now and when we move into our new events   center in 2010. We've been operating at a $15 [million] to $20 million [annual] loss over the past half-dozen years, so it helps us."                                                                                            New NBA Debt                                               Amount                  Rate                  Term                                              $100 million                  8.27 percent                  Seven years                                              $75 million                  7.45 percent                  Five years                                               Source:  NBA                                                            Each of the 15 teams can borrow a maximum of $11.66 million from the debt proceeds.      The private-placement deal was arranged by JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. In a private placement, non-banking lenders such as pension funds and   insurers extend the cash, commonly at fixed rates for five- to seven-year terms and at rates higher than what banks offer for floating-rate loans.      Harvey Benjamin, the NBA's executive counsel for business and finance, said it's important not to compare the rates with what the NBA had been   paying before the credit market collapse - about 200 to 300 interest points less for similar debt, sources said - but rather, what borrowers of similar   standing are paying in today's environment. In that light, he said, the 8.27 percent the NBA will pay on $100 million of the debt, and the 7.45 percent   on the remaining $75 million, is favorable.    link to full
