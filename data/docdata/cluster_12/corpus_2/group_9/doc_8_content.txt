hi GR          Had a look for sitloti, not sure what it relates to. Thanks for the ideas. I have been using the comm to help fund resi but feel the climate in becoming strong for comm so want to strenghten that side but will need to use the equity in the unencumbered comm to do it.   Could one of the MB's let me know which one of the big 4 have good comm lending product, currently with CBA   Appreciate the help
