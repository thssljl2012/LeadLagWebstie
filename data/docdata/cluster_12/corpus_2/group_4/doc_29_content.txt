From:      http://business.theage.com.au/busine...1107-5k6s.html      THE collapse of Allco Finance Group into receivership is in danger of creating a domino effect among its sharemarket-listed real estate and investment offshoots, with a flurry of statements from them warning of likely defaults on their debt repayment deals.  Allco&amp;#039;s demise has already taken with it the group&amp;#039;s subsidiary, which owns the management company that runs its Rubicon property trusts, Rubicon America, Rubicon Europe and Rubicon Japan.  The directors of Rubicon Holdings Australia called in receivers acting for National Australia Bank after deciding on Wednesday that the business was no longer a going concern. That came a day after Allco appointed administrators, having collapsed under the weight of $1 billion of debt.  The Rubicon &amp;amp;quot;triplets&amp;amp;quot; sought to reassure their investors that RHA&amp;#039;s failure had no immediate effect on Rubicon Asset Management (RAM), which runs them. RAM, though, remains an asset of its parent entity that is now in the hands of a receiver looking to recover any debts on NAB&amp;#039;s behalf.  RAM and the trusts are still viable, the ASX was told, although their shares have been suspended after the respective stocks went into a trading halt immediately in the wake of Allco&amp;#039;s receivership.  The suspensions  with Rubicon Europe at 0.5, Rubicon America at 2 and Rubicon Japan at 1.2  will continue until next Friday, when all three expect to update investors about their financial and operational positions.  However, the Rubicon trusts  whose sharemarket values have been wiped out because of the global credit crunch on their property interests  underlined the severity of the effect of Allco&amp;#039;s wipe-out on their own debt problems.  And both Rubicon Europe and America warned that the handover of Allco to receivers could trigger &amp;amp;quot;change of control&amp;amp;quot; conditions in their lending agreements and so lead to them to defaulting on hundreds of millions of dollars of loans.  Furthermore, Rubicon Europe stated that this almost definitely would be the case under complex debt reduction deals with NAB and investment bank Credit Suisse.  The European trust, like its siblings, has been trying to sell real estate assets to pay back both lenders, but sales have dried up in recent weeks.  All three businesses are engaged in urgent talks with Allco&amp;#039;s receiver Ferrier Hodgson about their management agreements and the employment status of the group&amp;#039;s staff.  It is expected that receivers will soon start to cut staff to reduce costs, although key executives could be re-employed directly by the trusts following the severing of the management deals.  The same situation faces another Allco-related ASX fund, Record Realty. Record&amp;#039;s securities were suspended at 1 for a further week yesterday as it also sought information from the receivers about the future management of its business. Record was directly run by Allco.  Allco Equity Partners, the listed private equity investment company in which Allco Finance has a 36% stake, insisted yesterday that its move to terminate its management deal with the group was valid.
