   Ravi,    thanks for your answer.    The problem, as I stated, is with _FQDN_ host name resolution, NETBIOS   broadcast name resolution - assuming NETBIOS is enabled - would be fine   for _short_ name resolution only.   I can&amp;#039;t predict how users will reference a server short vs. FQDN, but as   they have a properly configured DNS suffix search list, I would like DNS   to be working so that I am pretty sure I can catch all requestes.    Changing TTL at record level only for those servers hosted at remote   sites would make sense if there weere a smart and easy way to do that,   but I am not aware of any (say - I add a server I need to change TTL for   that new server manually).    Thanks - Gabriele.    &amp;amp;gt; -------- Original Message --------   &amp;amp;gt; Subject: RE: &amp;amp;#91ActiveDir&amp;amp;#93 DNS records TTL   &amp;amp;gt; From: &amp;quot;Sabharanjak, Ravi BGI SF&amp;quot; &amp;amp;lt;Ravi.Sabharanjak@barclaysglobal.com&amp;amp;gt;   &amp;amp;gt; Date: Tue, November 04, 2008 1:42 am   &amp;amp;gt; To: &amp;amp;lt;ActiveDir@mail.activedir.org&amp;amp;gt;   &amp;amp;gt; If you go the TTL route, I would recommend changing it on the record   &amp;amp;gt; level instead of at the zone level. It&amp;#039;ll only work when the record is   &amp;amp;gt; cached though, before the network outage.   &amp;amp;gt;     &amp;amp;gt; How about setting the netbios node type for the remote office to be &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;   &amp;amp;gt; type? The clients would fall back to broadcast in case the name   &amp;amp;gt; resolution fails via DNS and WINS.   &amp;amp;gt;     &amp;amp;gt; -Ravi   &amp;amp;gt; ________________________________   &amp;amp;gt; From: ActiveDir-owner@mail.activedir.org   &amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;#91mailto:ActiveDir-owner@mail.activedir.org&amp;amp;#93 On Behalf Of Gabriele   &amp;amp;gt; Scolaro   &amp;amp;gt; Sent: Monday, November 03, 2008 4:29 PM   &amp;amp;gt; To: ActiveDir@mail.activedir.org   &amp;amp;gt; Subject: &amp;amp;#91ActiveDir&amp;amp;#93 DNS records TTL   &amp;amp;gt;     &amp;amp;gt; Dear all,   &amp;amp;gt;     &amp;amp;gt; we have some small offices (range 5-30 users) where we did not place a   &amp;amp;gt; domain controller for some reasons - primarily because there is no   &amp;amp;gt; secure room for a DC (it&amp;#039;s a 2K3 AD, no RODC).   &amp;amp;gt; Locally only few servers are installed and mainly function as file/print   &amp;amp;gt; server, plus DHCP and DNS &amp;quot;caching only&amp;quot; server that all clients target   &amp;amp;gt; to as primary DNS server.   &amp;amp;gt;     &amp;amp;gt; When the WAN link to HUB DCs goes down I saw the Kerberos service   &amp;amp;gt; tickets are still valid (kerbtray) so users can access local file shares   &amp;amp;gt; and printers (unless they restart the machine or login just after the   &amp;amp;gt; WAN outage), but DNS cached records expire very soon in the DNS server   &amp;amp;gt; cache (I think default TTL is one hour or so for the entire zone).   &amp;amp;gt; Genrally this generally is not a big problem (no connectivity to the   &amp;amp;gt; HUB, nothing works, so no DNS worries!), but some users located at some   &amp;amp;gt; remote sites that need to access an application server located at that   &amp;amp;gt; remote site can&amp;#039;t resolve FQDN host name of those local servers because   &amp;amp;gt; the record is expired in the local DNS cache.   &amp;amp;gt;     &amp;amp;gt; Does it make sense to extend the TTL to say 8 hours? Any other   &amp;amp;gt; idea/approach? (I would avoid transferring zones to remote sites as   &amp;amp;gt; secondary).   &amp;amp;gt; I&amp;#039;m conscious that extending TTL will impact name resolution   &amp;amp;gt; accuracy/updateness.   &amp;amp;gt;     &amp;amp;gt; Thanks - Gabriele.    &amp;amp;gt;     &amp;amp;gt; --    &amp;amp;gt;     &amp;amp;gt; This message and any attachments are confidential, proprietary, and may be privileged.
