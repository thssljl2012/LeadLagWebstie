 City Centre   42 Acre Regeneration   Retail &amp; Leisure - Page 333 - SkyscraperCity      Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  Chris B                         You are correct that when the plans for the PSDA (as it was then) were drawn up, a replacement for the Paradise Street store was pencilled in for a unit on Lord Street (I believe it may actually have been where Barclays Bank now is, rather than Costa, but definitely in that area).      I think what changed the plans though was the closure of the Index chain of catalogue shops in mid-2005. This allowed Argos to acquire the Bold Street branch of Index, and thus maintain two stores in the city centre. In view of the fact that the Bold Street branch at one point was the most profitable Index in the entire country, and there is no reason to suggest it would not be similarly successful for Argos, they probably thought it was not worth pursuing a store in the PSDA any more, and pulled out. The timing of their disappearance from material relating to the PSDA would tally with this.      I think if we were going to see an Argos open up in Liverpool One, we would have seen evidence of it by now. Personally, I think the two they have are sufficient, as like Mostly Lurking notes, I don&amp;#039;t see how they could sustain three stores, not without cannibalising sales anyway.                         Remember seeing something similar myself.   The only problem now though is that the store on Paradise Street was an EXTRA.  This leaves us as a major city without an EXTRA,  unless you want to include the one in Birkenhead.  Before you all shout, I know there is one in Speke and one in Bell Vale but thats no good for anyone living in the north end of the city who doesn&amp;#039;t drive.      Come on Argos, convert the branch in St Johns into an EXTRA, Please !!!!!
