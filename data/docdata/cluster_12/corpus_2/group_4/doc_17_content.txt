Thank you for your detailed response.                      Not that high, but high enough. I&amp;#039;ll give you another detailed response.    Barclays pay grades - roughly equivalent to levels of authority, but not always. I&amp;#039;ll include some examples of jobs that fall into each. Then you can guess what my job is, based on the fact that I don&amp;#039;t fall on to this scale.    B1 - Cashiers  B2 - Cash Managers (look after Cashiers), Human Resources Assistants, your average call center worker.  B3 - Personal Bankers, Counter Managers (look after Cashiers and Cash Managers), some Branch Managers, some Assistant Branch Managers.  B4 - Some BMs, some ABMs, Mortgage Sellers, some Premier Relationship Managers.  B5 - Some BMs, some PRMs.  B6 - Some BMs, Area Performance Managers.  B7 - Area Directors.    The grades of BMs also relate to the size of the branch, if you&amp;#039;re wondering. A small, single site branch might be a B3 branch, with a B3 branch manager. Such a branch will have a few cashiers and maybe a seller, otherwise the manager is expected to sell as well. A B6 site, for example, might be Swindon or Reading branches - massive branches with 10+ sellers. The last branch I worked in was a B5 branch across three sites, with about 25 staff including six sellers.
