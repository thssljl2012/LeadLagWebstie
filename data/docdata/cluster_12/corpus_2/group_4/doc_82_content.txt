Another view of the coming surprise for Gen Ys           Quote:                         Financial crisis brings good times to an end      Leesha McKenny   November 16, 2008      THE children of the economic boom, generation Y, are about to get a reality wake-up call.      As the Reserve Bank of Australia downgraded its expectations for growth last week and the sharemarket reflected growing fears of a recession, the next 12 months threatens to be a new world for young workers, warn pundits.      Demographer Bernard Salt said an economic downturn will prove a turning point for those aged between 15 and 30 as fewer job options in a contracting economy force them to make compromises for the first time.      &amp;amp;quot;In some respects the looming recession in 2009 will abruptly end the long Indian summer of generation Y&amp;#039;s youth,&amp;amp;quot; he said. &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;#039;ve spoken to a lot to baby boomers and generation X about generation Y and there&amp;#039;s definitely the feeling that what these young people need is a jolly good recession to shake them up.&amp;amp;quot;      TD Securities senior strategist Joshua Williamson said younger people accustomed to job jumping will find it harder to secure a position as vacancies start to dry up.      &amp;amp;quot;The big question is how long this credit crunch will go for,&amp;amp;quot; he said. &amp;amp;quot;And generation Y has never known a high degree of uncertainty - we&amp;#039;ve had strong employment growth, we&amp;#039;ve had strong incomes growth.      &amp;amp;quot;They&amp;#039;ll possibly notice credit will be harder to obtain. Some of them may not be provided with credit as easily as they would have 12 or 24 months ago.&amp;amp;quot;      Mr Williamson said this could be a &amp;amp;quot;defining moment&amp;amp;quot; for young people accustomed to using credit to fuel high levels of discretionary spending during a 16-year period of cheap debt and good liquidity.      &amp;amp;quot;I think that will be a big thing for many of them who have only known buoyant economic times, full employment and an ability to choose between jobs.&amp;amp;quot;      Along with a rise in enrolments for university courses next year, commentators are saying a recession traditionally leads to a tightening of the jobs market for university leavers.      Graduate Careers Australia executive director Cindy Tilbrook said while the pain might be eased by vacancies due to an ageing workforce and an continuing skills shortage in areas such as health and engineering, those with a &amp;amp;quot;less defined&amp;amp;quot; career path from humanities or generalist degrees were more likely to struggle to find work.      &amp;amp;quot;They are the ones who feel it even in good times because their outcomes are not as good as those in skill-shortage areas,&amp;amp;quot; she said.      Mr Salt added that young people today were better equipped to handle a recession than previous generations - and might even turn out to be more resilient for the experience.      &amp;amp;quot;Generation Y is the most educated in history. They&amp;#039;re articulate, they&amp;#039;re confident, they&amp;#039;re well-travelled, they are knowledgeable,&amp;amp;quot; he said. &amp;amp;quot;They are incredibly plugged in, good with relationships and identifying opportunities.&amp;amp;quot;      &amp;amp;quot;I suppose the real question will be, will they want to adapt to [jobs that] they don&amp;#039;t really enjoy. Will they just grin and bear it, or will they maintain their flighty ways?&amp;amp;quot;      Those flighty ways also mean that generation Y is less tied to commitments, such as a mortgage or marriage and children, which can all cause financial pain during an economic downturn, Mr Salt said.      &amp;amp;quot;So I think it is generation X that is really going to cop it between the eyes,&amp;amp;quot; he said.                      http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/...319000858.html
