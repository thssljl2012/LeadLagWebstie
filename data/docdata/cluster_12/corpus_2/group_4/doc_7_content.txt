Just for the record, and in case it makes a difference, our major banks are Australian-owned: BNZ, ANZ, National and Westpac (ANZ owns National or vice versa; I forget, yet bank with both).  There are others of course, but the big four are Aussie-owned.    Several years ago the NZ Govt did inject cash (600M I think) into the BNZ but instead of going that route again we sold it to the Australians a few years later.    In 1984 things were seriously different.  We were broke and raising money from the US on credit cards, thanks to our late Prime Minister of the time, Rob Muldoon (Right) and his &amp;#039;Think Big&amp;#039; civil projects.  When the Labour government, led by David Lange (Left), came into power in the 84 election they worked to correct that.    But yes you are correct Nasty. It&amp;#039;s not a prop-up for the bank/s.  It&amp;#039;s insurance/guarantee for depositors&amp;#039; funds.  In my work I saw the first draft proposals come through our office a good six months ago.  I&amp;#039;m not aware of any downgrade in credit ratings for our banks.    Life in the Shire ambles merrily along, for now            Honey, you couldn&amp;#039;t handle half of me
