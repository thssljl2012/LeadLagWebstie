       Commentary 1:31 PM, 26 Nov 2008    Tony Boyd      QBE&amp;#039;s sterling appetite  QBE chief executive Frank O&amp;#039;Halloran, who is rightly known as the great acquirer of the global insurance industry, today chalked up another landmark deal with the purchase of ZC Sterling in the United States.  At the same time he is taking the opportunity to restock the QBE war chest with $2.1 billion in fresh capital so that QBE can easily cope with another $2 to $3 billion in acquisitions in 2009.  In cementing his reputation as the master of cross border M&amp;amp;amp;A, O&amp;#039;Halloran today provided the market with some pretty strong indications that QBE had found his successor.  Buried in the 146 pages of documents released today, QBE revealed that chief operating officer, Vince McLenaghan has been acting president and chief executive officer (the Americas) since June this year. He moved to the US to replace Tim Kenny who retired in June.  O&amp;#039;Halloran&amp;#039;s confidence in McLenaghan is obvious from his transfer to the US to lead the due diligence on ZC Sterling. At 49 years of age McLenaghan is one of the youngest executives in QBE&amp;#039;s top ranks, O&amp;#039;Halloran has been running QBE for more than a decade. But whenever retirement is mentioned the 62-year-old reaffirms his enthusiasm for the job.  The ZC Sterling deal fits the QBE model for conservative acquisitions in the insurance sector. It involves paying up front for the full revenue uplift while locking in the vendors to deliver on future growth in return for further payments in year two and three.  ZC Sterling will cost $US575 million up front and potentially up to another $US525 million if it meets profit forecasts in 2009 and 2010. ZC Sterling will add additional gross written premium of $US425 million in 2009 and $US575 million in 2010.  QBE also paid $US120 million for two underwriting agencies that are expected to generate gross written premium of $US100 million in 2009.  Net earned premium for 2009 is expected to be 25 per cent higher than previously forecast by the company at $14 billion.  The spate of recent acquisitions in offshore markets will mean that in 2009 only 20 per cent of QBE&amp;#039;s net earned premium will come from its Australian operations. That tells you that under O&amp;#039;Halloran and chairman John Cloney QBE has become a truly global company.  It&amp;#039;s capacity to keep expanding is formidable. Deutsche Bank analyst James Coghill recently estimated that QBE generates fresh capital from profit retention of $400 to $500 million each half year.  QBE said today that following its capital raising, which is being handled by JPMorgan, Macquarie and Merrill Lynch, QBE will have regulatory capital around two times the minimum capital required by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.  The company admitted today that movements in markets since June had negatively affected the earnings on its $23.3 billion in investment assets but the portfolio was conservatively constructed with only 7.6 per cent in equities.  QBE will end 2008 having made about $US2 billion in acquisitions, about the same as 2007. The ZC Sterling deal looks like a classic counter-cyclical move that should benefit from the likely hardening of insurance rates caused by the capacity constraints following AIG&amp;#039;s near collapse.  The big unknown is whether this latest deal will be O&amp;#039;Halloran&amp;#039;s swan song.
