From MediaBiz      DISH Network and the Community Broadcasters Association (CBA) on Wednesday announced a partnership plan that would help prepare customers for the Feb. 17, 2009 digital TV transition.       As part of the deal, DISH Network said it will make an effort to promote and sell its suite of digital-to-analog converter boxes specifically to customers in need with a portion of the proceeds going to support CBA&amp;#039;s digital transition education efforts.       DISH Network, a leader in the digital transition, is proud to partner with the CBA in this widespread effort to offer over-the-air consumers the tools and resources they need to continue enjoying their favorite channels following the switch, said Tom Stingley, DISH Network&amp;#039;s executive vice president of sales and distribution.      CBA vice president of technology Greg Herman went on to endorse DISH&amp;#039;s converter boxes, saying the units &amp;quot;offer a substantially more intelligent and appropriate option for consumers and will help avoid the numerous problems created by the distribution of boxes that block analog signals.
