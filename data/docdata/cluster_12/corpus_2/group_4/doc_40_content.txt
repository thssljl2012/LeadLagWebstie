            Quote from: Armedpawn on November 06, 2008, 09:51:36 AM    Ya i thought the Rockefeller where related Rothschild in blood?And all those names u said above i have always considered to be ashkenazi zionists and not anglo white europeans.Anyways i will have to read that book to get a full understanding of why alex calls them anglos.   I&amp;amp;#039;m not sure about the blood relations, but early on the Rothschilds understood the problems if they named all their holdings after themselves, and they began to name them after their agents.  In 1831 they formed a bank in Belgium, but named it after their agent, it becoming the Lambert bank.&amp;amp;nbsp; Lambert also married a Rothschild, just as the CEO of Barclays is married to a Rothschild.  Another of their chain of banks was named after their agent, Erlanger or d&amp;amp;#039;Erlanger (he was French.)&amp;amp;nbsp; He financed the South during the Civil War while other of their operations financed the North.&amp;amp;nbsp; Erlanger&amp;amp;#039;s son married the South&amp;amp;#039;s finance manager&amp;amp;#039;s daughter, whom he met when she came to France with her father.&amp;amp;nbsp; The son moved to the South with his wife and established railroads, hospitals and even towns across the south.  It&amp;amp;#039;s not one book about the Rothschilds, but many books and other sources you can find by searching google.com and books.google.com.
