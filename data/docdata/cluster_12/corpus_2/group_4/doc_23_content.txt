           P.S. for those that use the Barclays Telephone Banking service,  don,t be surprised if the call is diverted to a call centre in Qatar?, or maybe Abu Dhabi?.  (in the near future).    So Barney Rubble asks Fred &amp;amp;quot;Say buddy, do the Middle East do banking call centres?&amp;amp;quot;  ...Fred retorted &amp;amp;quot;Sure Barney.......ABU DHABI DO!&amp;amp;quot;   [Irky hears the the odd cough &amp;amp;amp; the sound of crisp packets rustling in the audience - &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;#039;ll get me coat&amp;amp;quot;, he concedes)
