         Some of the news stories coming out of the Abu Dhabi International Exhibition and conference, ADIPEC, which opened today and lasts for three days   Omani Minister says there&amp;#039;ll probably be a slow-down in some of their downstream projects   http://www.reuters.com:80/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtili...    ABU DHABI, Nov 3 (Reuters) - A global financial crisis will affect Oman&amp;#039;s oil and gas development projects and may cause delays, Omani Minister of Oil and Gas Mohammad bin Hamad bin Seif al-Rumhy said on Monday. ...  &amp;amp;quot;The recent financial problems will have an impact because most of our projects are on project finance,&amp;amp;quot; Rumhy told Reuters at an oil and gas conference. &amp;amp;quot;It is a more challenging environment than six months ago. If we can&amp;#039;t borrow, we will have to delay.&amp;amp;quot;  Rumhy named the Duqm refinery and petrochemical complex project as one of the developments that could face delays.  &amp;amp;quot;Oman&amp;#039;s development plans will continue but certain projects will be revisited,&amp;amp;quot; he added.  The government announced plans at the end of 2006 to build the Duqm Refining and Petrochemical Complex, which would see the construction of Oman&amp;#039;s third refinery at al-Duqm in the southeast of the country.  The plan, which is faced with rising costs, would include a 300,000-bpd refinery and a petrochemicals facility including a polypropylene plant with a capacity of 1.2 million to 1.5 million tonnes a year. Commercial production had been set for 2012.  Rumhy also said he expected Oman&amp;#039;s oil production to rise to 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2009 from 750,000 to 760,000 bpd this year and gas output to remain steady at 60 million cubic metres per day....   But the UAE Minister, opening the conference, has urged Middle East producers to keep investing, despite lower prices (full text of speech, long story, with lots of irrelevant verbiage):   http://www.wam.org.ae:80/servlet/Satellite?c=WamLocEnews&amp;amp;amp...   ...  &amp;#039;&amp;#039;The challenges facing world economy today should not prevent us from continuing investments in the petroleum industry but on the contrary it should serve as an impetus to prepare for the next cycle of growth,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he indicated.  &amp;#039;&amp;#039;The petroleum Industry is characteristically a long term investment industry where prices rise and fall in response to market forces, but one basic constant never changes: the continuously growing demand for energy in a world where population density is increasing.  &amp;#039;&amp;#039;It is common knowledge that the age of easy oil is gone forever.  Consequently we need to seize the opportunities offered by new technology to advance exploration techniques for new discoveries, increase recovery rates from existing fields, improve efficiency, and streamline our operations to reduce costs,&amp;#039;&amp;#039;he added.   And Shell and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, ADNOC, have announced an MoU for Shell to explore for deep gas offshore.    http://www.reuters.com:80/article/marketsNews/idUSSP39833920...    SINGAPORE, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) have signed a preliminary deal to jointly explore, develop and produce offshore gas fields in Abu Dhabi, Shell said on Monday.  &amp;amp;quot;ADNOC and Shell Abu Dhabi signed a memorandum of understanding today under which Shell will evaluate potential joint exploration, development and production with ADNOC of offshore deep gas fields prospects in Abu Dhabi,&amp;amp;quot; Shell said in a statement.  &amp;amp;quot;Once the evaluation is completed, Shell hopes to move forward rapidly with final agreements in order to quickly begin joint exploration and development activities.&amp;amp;quot;   AIUI, the MoU is designed to focus on the pre-Khuff (very deep). Nothing on the Shell website yet, as far as I can see, so I&amp;#039;ve no idea of the location of the acreage.   More announcements later this week perhaps, plus whatever G Brown and P Mandelson have to say here about their hopes of getting the Gulf states to pump multi-billions into the IMF bail-out fund!  Abu Dhabi  still  has a bit left after the purchase of the Barclays stake  Man Siarad
