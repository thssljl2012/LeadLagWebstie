         Is anyone interested in starting a movement online to vote down Barclays&amp;#039; sell-off to mid-east investors? We could put together an alternative proposal so that existing investors have the right to buy on those same terms and the new investors only get their foot in the door if we don&amp;#039;t. I&amp;#039;d be happy to start a Facebook or perhaps even put together a website...
