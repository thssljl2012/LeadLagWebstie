   &amp;amp;quot;In addition to the public subsidies and billions of dollars of increased revenue, the Yankees will benefit from a change to Major League Baseball&amp;#039;s 2002 collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which allows teams to deduct new-stadium building costs from the revenue-sharing payments they make. For the Yankees, whose $200 million player payroll makes them the largest contributor to the revenue-sharing pool, this means 40 percent of their share of the price tag may be borne by the remaining 29 baseball teams.
