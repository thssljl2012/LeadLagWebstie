       &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;if dry cargo rates are down 95%,why cant i ship stuff much cheaper?&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;  Credit spreads???  Half full ships spreading costs across fewer goods in the hold???  Half of fleet put in mothballs so half number of ships moving half the number of goods leading to same amount of goods per transit???  Goods shipping is down because demand is down.  Just look at the foreign car manufacturers.  Insurance costs through the roof, or not available???  Thank you AIG.  Pirates aren&amp;#039;t helping but costs should be 10% increase at the most.  I read that the shipping industry is really locked up.  Apparently you used to be able to do business on a letter of credit but now you need a pledge of your first born male and have him in the bank&amp;#039;s special holding hotel before you are good to go.
