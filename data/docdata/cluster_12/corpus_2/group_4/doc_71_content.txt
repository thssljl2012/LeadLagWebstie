 American News:     KING GEORGE V DEAD, EDWARD VIII IS KING: King George V, beloved by loyalists in the former British Empire, died after a lethal dose of morphine and cocaine administered in his bed by his physician Lord Dawson on January 20. Dawson said he wished to stop his suffering for him and his family. George V&amp;#039;s health had already deteriorated after the First World War, when he was depressed by the outcome and started chain smoking. He had also suffered many respiratory problems previously. This led to him being restricted to his bed in Ottawa, Canada after the Syndicalists took over the British Isles. His son, Edward has taken the throne. The Entente have gone into a state of mourning, as Edward VIII now has to decide the best course for his nation.     LA PLATA WAREHOUSE EXPLODES, UNKNOWN CAUSE: A warehouse in Buenos Aires exploded along the waterfront of the Plate River.

REVOLT IN CHICAGO: A Syndicalist protest in Chicago quickly turned into a riot as several American First Union Party members began hurling stones at the protesters. The AFUP is another major independent party that advocates stronger federal leadership, which would be considered fascism. The AFUP supporters then began club Syndicalists. When the police arrived to control the riot, Syndicalists began to swarm the police officers and disarm them. Eventually, a gunfight broke out. AFUP supporters used torches to burn several stores down in order to cover their retreat. Eventually, more police managed to keep the situation under control. This incident has sparked more minor protests around the nation, condemning the Syndicalists, AFUP, and government alike. The overall casualty report is 13 police officers, 30 Syndicalists, and 12 AFUS supporters dead, as well as over 80 wounded. Property damage is still being calculated. Jack Reed has not been blamed for the riot, as he had no affiliation with this particular Syndicalist group. However, Huey Long, leader of the AFUP and one of the presidential candidates in the 1936 election, has been blamed, due to his speeches against Marxism.
