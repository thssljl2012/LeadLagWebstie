 Was reading the facebook.com.au case yesterday and thought about a possible opportunity. Do you think this would work?     The problem:  Identity management. In the world of work, reputation equates to income, and so it&amp;#039;s important for senior managers in listed companies to protect their identity. Nothing is as crucial to one&amp;#039;s identity as a name, and I would be upset if someone registered danielnerezov.com only to turn in it into a directory with links to irrelevant websites.     The solution:  Offer senior managers in listed companies an efficient personal branding solution where I register a relevant domain name and then offer that person the purchase of this name, plus additional services like a website, detailing their bio etc.     e.g.  I register RalphNorris.com (who is ceo of commonwealth bank) and then contact him about selling him the domain, together with additional products.     As far as I can tell, judging by the case in facebook.com.au, Ralph wouldn&amp;#039;t be able to appeal and try to take the name from me because it&amp;#039;s neither a trademark, neither is it a unique name, and neither was it purchased to hinder Ralph in earning a living. So, given these reasons, I&amp;#039;m not sure if ralph would pay. I mean, would you?    Thanks
