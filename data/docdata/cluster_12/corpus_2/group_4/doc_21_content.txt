         Hi Precinct   There goes another slab of a British company, to foreign ownership.   There was a thread here a couple of days ago about ownership of British companies, particularly foreign ownership - British Steel for example, is owned by an Indian company. Whether it is foreign companies operating in the UK or outright ownership of a British company by a foreign company is immaterial. What matters is that it is extremely detrimental to the economy to have a large proportion of the British economy owned by others. Australia used to be in the position of being &amp;amp;quot;owned&amp;amp;quot; by British companies as did most Commonwealth countries and those companies simply treated Australia as a cash cow. Malaysia, which I think you are now resident in, was exactly in exactly the same position.  I find it quite ironic that the boot appears to be on the other foot and it is the UK who now finds itself in a position of being &amp;amp;quot;foreign&amp;amp;quot; owned.  It goes without saying that foreign companies operate for the benefit of their own shareholders and their own country. They will extract the maximum benefit from the country they operate in and pay the least amount of tax and the least amount of wages they can get away with. Transfer pricing, sleight of hand Country of Origin certificates and other little tricks are all used in their efforts to maximise profits for themselves.  The UK must be losing an enormous amount of money which is being siphoned out of the  economy if the scale of foreign ownership is anything like it appears to be.  Regards Harmy
