I would suggest a $150k- $180k commercial bill for between 30 - 60 days and rolled over until you make more concrete plans.      There are some great bargains in shares at the moment so allocate say $20k to blue chip - CBA, BHP, Rio - for 3 yrs min.      Consider purchasing a property/apartment off the plan (OTP) soon.  You require 10% deposit now and settle in 2 or 3 yrs time or upon completion.  You also have the advantage of paying no stamp duty or very little in Melbourne if you buy this type of property before work starts.  Your 10% is also accruing interest during this period.   You can still purchase an OTP apartment in Melb for low $300&amp;#039;s and receive a great rental return as the vacancy rates are very low at present and will continue in the future.      I am working for a company that sells OTP properties throughout Oz and Victoria is still the only state that offers the stamp duty concessions.      Remember, diversification is the key especially in the current economic climate.      Hope this helps
