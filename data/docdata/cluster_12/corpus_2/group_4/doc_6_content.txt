Quote:                          Banks line up      Only last week the Commonwealth Bank moved to protect its loans of at least $600 million with an unlimited charge over ABC&amp;#039;s assets, which include more than 1200 centres in Australia and New Zealand.      The bank has already written down $100 million worth of ABC Learning notes it held.      Westpac, ANZ and the National Australia Bank are also owed more than $100 million each.      They have been supporting the company since it was plunged into crisis in February when it announced its half-year earnings had fallen 42% after hefty property developer payments were stripped out of its accounts on the orders of its new auditors.
