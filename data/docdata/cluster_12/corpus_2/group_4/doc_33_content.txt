Their superstore on Paradise St was one of the first to go and I vaguely remember seeing L1 plans with an Argos store on them , in fact I think they may have originally envisaged having the corner store where Costa Coffee is .                      You are correct that when the plans for the PSDA (as it was then) were drawn up, a replacement for the Paradise Street store was pencilled in for a unit on Lord Street (I believe it may actually have been where Barclays Bank now is, rather than Costa, but definitely in that area).    I think what changed the plans though was the closure of the Index chain of catalogue shops in mid-2005. This allowed Argos to acquire the Bold Street branch of Index, and thus maintain two stores in the city centre. In view of the fact that the Bold Street branch at one point was the most profitable Index in the entire country, and there is no reason to suggest it would not be similarly successful for Argos, they probably thought it was not worth pursuing a store in the PSDA any more, and pulled out. The timing of their disappearance from material relating to the PSDA would tally with this.    I think if we were going to see an Argos open up in Liverpool One, we would have seen evidence of it by now. Personally, I think the two they have are sufficient, as like Mostly Lurking notes, I don&amp;#039;t see how they could sustain three stores, not without cannibalising sales anyway.
