    Mega Corruption alleged in Qadirpur&amp;#039;s privatisation           Friday, 07 Nov, 2008   02:29 AM PST             ISLAMABAD: Workers union of the Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDCL) has sought the intervention of the prime minister and president to stop the privatisation of Qadirpur Gas Field, which generates $155million annual revenue and accounts for over 30 per cent of OGDCLs total gas production.         While speaking at a news conference here on Thursday, General Secretary OGDCL (CBA) Mohammad Aqleem Khan and other officer bearers of the union threatened boycotts and protests against the privatisation of what they called the national asset and backbone of Pakistans energy generation if both the political leaders did not put off the sale of the gas field immediately.         We can even sacrifice our lives to save this national asset, observed President of the OGDCLs Officers Association, Aslam Khan Niazi.          If the field was sold to foreign companies they would sell gas $7 per mmbtu (million British thermal unit), while OGDCL was selling at Rs124 per unit. Mr Niazi said that gas would become so much expensive that the fertilisers and chemicals industries of Punjab would not be able to operate. They country would be strangulated economically as the Qadirpurs gas to power generation companies would not be available anymore and electricity consumers would have to pay high charges for power generated through thermal.         The workers said that it was beyond their comprehension as to what had made the government to decide to put on sale the profit-making gas field, in which, they say, British Petroleum and Austrias OMV were interested.         The union leader said that the Privatisation Commission had valued the total assets of the gas field at $2billion while its real cost was over $7billion. OGDCL has so far extracted 1.7trillion cubic feet from one zone of Qadirpur gas field alone, while two other field were yet to be dug. The OGDCL has put total gas reserves from the field at 2.5 trillion cubic feet.         The union leader said that while valuing the gas field, the authorities had not included the value of the remaining two zones which were yet to be put in use by the OGDCL. They accused the authorities and big fish for eyeing millions of dollars in kick backs in case they facilitated the sale of the Qadirpur gas field.         This is a scandal bigger than that of the sale of Pakistan Steel Mills, which could not be materialised owing to the timely intervention of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, said the unions president, Chaudhry Mohammad Akram. He said the workers would also get a stay from the court against the controversial sale of Qadirpur gas field.         He said that OGDCL was producing 64 per cent of the total oil production of the country, while the remaining 34 per cent was produced by 30 multinational companies altogether.         They said the gas field also paid $40.57million annual royalty, $10.59million in excise duty to the government, $52.3million in sales tax and $79.08million in income tax. Its sale would create numerous problems for the country within a few years and its industry would crumble like a house of cards, he warned and appealed to all the industrialists of the country to come out and oppose the sale of the gas field for the sake of Pakistans future.           http://www.dawn.net/wps/wcm/connect/...vatisation+aah
