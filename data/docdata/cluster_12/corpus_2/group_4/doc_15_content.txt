         Hi Harmy   There was a thread here a couple of days ago about ownership of British companies, particularly foreign ownership - British Steel for example, is owned by an Indian company. Whether it is foreign companies operating in the UK or outright ownership of a British company by a foreign company is immaterial. What matters is that it is extremely detrimental to the economy to have a large proportion of the British economy owned by others.   Yes I read that other thread with interest. It is ironic that France is probably the most protectionist country of it&amp;#039;s own major companies in the EU (they are currently proposing EU-legislation that would protect &amp;#039;key companies&amp;#039; against foreign take-over), and yet it is they that took over British Energy just last month.  And here we have 1/3rd of another of the better British companies being sold off abroad. The further irony is that if Gordon Brown had have had a policy of putting money away while the sun shone, rather than hosing it down the drain, Barclays would not have to sell out to foreign sovereign wealth funds (i.e. countries who have and are saving while the sun shines, and are investing it for their own futures).
