Looks like the much touted rail link between Adelaide and Darwin is a financial disaster and will be hard to sell.       http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au...17-643,00.html           FreightLink in voluntary liquidation       Cath Hart   November 07, 2008       FREIGHTLINK, the owner and operator of the Adelaide to Darwin freight line, has placed its $1.2 billion business in voluntary administration.         The project had been hailed by former prime minister John Howard as Australia&amp;#039;s gateway to Asia.      The move was prompted by the failure of the FreightLink board, which includes former deputy prime minister Tim Fischer, to secure support from all 10 of its mezzanine noteholders for the sale of the troubled company to a bidder by the end of September.       The FreightLink board yesterday reassured customers of the company, owned by the parent Asia-Pacific Transport Consortium, that it would be &amp;amp;quot;business as usual&amp;amp;quot; on its 2244km railway between the Port of Darwin and Adelaide.       FreightLink chairman Malcolm Kinnaird said yesterday the board was &amp;amp;quot;very disappointed that the sale process, which had yielded an attractive bid, had been thwarted by the inability to achieve consensus.&amp;amp;quot;       The collapse of the sale -- which relied on consensus among lenders, shareholders and mezzanine noteholders -- comes seven months after FreightLink put itself on the market at the behest of its senior bankers, and occurred despite the preferred bidder&amp;#039;s offer being &amp;amp;quot;significantly higher&amp;amp;quot; than senior debt.       Mr Kinnaird said FreightLink had &amp;amp;quot;considerable debt&amp;amp;quot; -- understood to be about $500 million, including $300 million in senior debt -- incurred to fund the railway&amp;#039;s construction.       He said the outlook for the business under a &amp;amp;quot;more appropriate capital structure was positive and would allow the business to continue to grow and prosper&amp;amp;quot;.       The Adelaide-Darwin rail corridor, which received state and federal government funding, was touted as the key to unlocking increased Asian trade into Australia, but demand was overestimated and competition from sea freight underestimated.       The FreightLink board yesterday appointed Steve Parbery from PPB as administrator, and the company&amp;#039;s lenders -- understood to be ANZ, the Royal Bank of Scotland and 14 other foreign banks, mostly based in Singapore -- appointed KordaMentha partner Martin Madden as receiver.       Mr Madden said he hoped to have the sale completed by &amp;amp;quot;the back end of January or early February&amp;amp;quot;.       &amp;amp;quot;Christmas is obviously an awkward time,&amp;amp;quot; he said.       &amp;amp;quot;A considerable amount of work was done on the earlier sale by UBS -- we intend to piggyback on what they&amp;#039;ve done to refresh the sale process and hopefully shorten it.&amp;amp;quot;       Mr Madden said he hoped earlier bidders for FreightLink would return to the table but he was not sure the new deal would be equal to or better than the old one that the three mezzanine noteholders had been unable to accept.       &amp;amp;quot;They obviously were unhappy with the previous offer. Whether we do better now remains to be seen,&amp;amp;quot; he said.       It is understood the preferred bidder from the earlier sale was selected because they were able to fund their offer from their own balance sheet.       The deal would have resulted in the banks being fully paid out and mezzanine noteholders would have received an undisclosed percentage of their investment.       A committee of mezzanine noteholders was formed to consider the offer. Those in agreement gradually left until the only remaining members were three dissenting noteholders, understood to be seeking a contribution from the banks.       One of the dissenters was believed to be based locally while the other two were from overseas.       A source close to the deal said the demand for the banks at the top of the capital structure to compromise and make a return to the mezzanine noteholders was &amp;amp;quot;extraordinary&amp;amp;quot; and something that &amp;amp;quot;simply doesn&amp;#039;t happen in Australia&amp;amp;quot;.       One source said the mezzanine noteholders&amp;#039; inability to agree had &amp;amp;quot;caused the insolvency of this important piece of Australian infrastructure and delayed a sale, which may result in a lower price. The question for them is whether they get a better deal now.&amp;amp;quot;       Darwin-based Territory Resources&amp;#039; logistics and procurement general manager Blake Cousins said the miner still anticipated moving 500,000 tonnes of iron ore each day by train from its Frances Creek project 190km south of Darwin to the Port of Darwin &amp;amp;quot;seven days a week&amp;amp;quot;.       &amp;amp;quot;As far as we&amp;#039;re aware it&amp;#039;s business a usual and our rail services are still running and we&amp;#039;re still delivering iron ore into Darwin,&amp;amp;quot; he said.
