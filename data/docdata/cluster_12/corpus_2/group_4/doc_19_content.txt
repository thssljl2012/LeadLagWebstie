 Hi - I&amp;#039;ve just accepted a job in Abu Dhabi with Big 4 consulting firm. Can anyone suggest the best way to do banking in AB.      It would be good if i could set this up before I go out. I&amp;#039;m with Barclays at the moment, but should I look at other providers, local banks, offshore?      All help appreciated.      Thanks
