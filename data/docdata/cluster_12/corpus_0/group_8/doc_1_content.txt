Well, that didn&#8217;t take them long did it? I said it here months ago that if we voted a banker in it would be one big grab fest for the bankers and voila. Only to save sound big businesses in need a temporary injection of course. Superannuation funds, which could include the Cullen Fund, will play a major role in the multibillion-dollar equity investment pool proposed at last week&#8217;s Jobs Summit as a salve to recession-hit firms&#8217; balance sheets.

Hodges said that at last week&#8217;s summit it was made clear that a number of superannuation fund investors including KiwiSaver providers and potentially even the New Zealand Superannuation or Cullen Fund &#8220;would dearly love to be able to invest into part of the SME sector but there aren&#8217;t easy mechanisms for them to find partner businesses in which to invest&#8221;.
