By China WatcherFor the many anti-China bashers, so-called experts, economists and critics who predicted that Chinas economy will collapse way back in 1995 due to its infrastructural bottlenecks and the poor management inefficiency because of its perceived lack of human rights and freedom of speech, the results showed otherwise.Some sincere and truthful economist (devoid of a hidden agenda) predicted that the Chinese economy is going to recover first from the economic slum. From the recent market developments in Asia, it was the expectation of a Chinese second stimulus package which has generated renewed and strong interest in the markets from Japan to Indonesia. Most Asian markets were up yesterday.The surprising news that comes from Bloomberg (a media supporting Western type human rights blatantly) indicated that the Industrial Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) is now the largest bank in the world in terms of market capitalization.
