  KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 15  Minority shareholders of listed firms should be careful with investments as they will be hit hard next year following difficulties in the economy, according to the Minority Shareholders Watchdog Group (MSWG). Its chief executive officer Abdul Wahab Jaafar Sidek also did not discount the possibility of some firms closing down, fully or partially, in facing the uncertainty brought on by external factors. &#8220;Minority shareholders will be hit very hard. Let&#8217;s not kid ourselves as this time, it is more serious than the last financial downturn,&#8221; he told reporters after a briefing today. He said that whatever happened overseas would definitely impact local firms.  IOI WCT30%S       1582.25%1049.13%  MAYBANK TELEKOM TENAGA DIGI AIRASIA  CITIBANK AIGTEMASEK 7%eagles27975@gmail.com
