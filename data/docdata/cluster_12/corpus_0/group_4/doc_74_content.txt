 Washington DC sues Bank of America in tax case Fri Oct 31, 2008 4:26pm EDT WASHINGTON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Washington, D.C., filed a $105 million suit against Bank of America on Friday that alleges the bank failed to notify the city about fraudulent checks that were part of an embezzlement scheme.  &amp;#8220;To date, at least 116 fraudulent tax refund checks worth more than $34 million have been identified as having been laundered through Defendant Bank,&amp;#8221; it said. The city is alleging that bank employees cut checks for phony refunds that they deposited at Bank of America branches in the district and Maryland, offering gifts and cash to various tellers and employees for helping in the scheme.  The scheme was uncovered when another bank, SunTrust (STI.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), informed federal authorities in 2007 that it had received a suspicious check for a large sum, leading federal authorities to raid the homes of city employee Harriette Walters and others. Walters and her niece Jayrece Turnbull have since pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to conspiracy to defraud the city. District Chief Financial Officer Natwar Gandhi is seeking to fire 14 employees in the Office of Tax and Revenue who the U.S. attorney&amp;#8217;s office has identified as receiving checks from Walters.
