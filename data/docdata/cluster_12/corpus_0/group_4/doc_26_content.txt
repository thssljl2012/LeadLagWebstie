Courtesy and Thanks: Dawn Union forms strategy to reverse privatisation order By Waseem Shamsi Saturday, 08 Nov, 2008   02:14 AM PST   SUKKUR: With the federal government totally refusing to budge an inch from the decision of privatizing Qadirpur gas field, the gas field union and its workers have come out with a long term strategy to undo the decision, which they called the brain child of minister for privatisation Syed Naveed Qamar, and aimed to deprive Sindh of its biggest natural resource of oil and gas.  The field was inaugurated by Shaheed Muhtarma Benazeer Bhutto in 1995, and the workers say that, its privatisation would badly damage the party&amp;#8217;s overall image, especially in Sindh province. Joint secretary of the union Zahid Bhutto talking to this scribe on phone termed this as conspiracy of the minister privatisation and warned that, the workers would not allow the sale of the field, which was being done at a throwaway price. He said that, Sindh had a valid claim on Qadirpur gas field for which all the political parties of Sindh had extended unanimous support to the field workers and had joined in a mass protest rally at the site field, last month and had blocked the national highway for several hours. He said that, the workers would start sitting on hunger strikes from November 10 in all important districts of Sindh and in front of press clubs and would also cordon the residence of federal minister Naveed Qamar on November 16 at Hyderabad. As a next step, he said that, the union would also seek legal remedy by filing a petition in the Sindh high court. He further said that, the present government, which was claiming everyday to comply with the will of the people, had in fact gone against them and urged the president and prime minister to set aside the privatisation of Qadirpur gas field in the interest of people of Sindh. http://www.dawn.net/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn%20Content%20Library/dawn/news/pakistan/sindh/union+forms+strategy+to+reverse+qadirpurs+privatisation+aah &amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;- http://www.dawn.net/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn%20Content%20Library/dawn/news/pakistan/corruption+alleged+in+qadirpur+fields+privatisation+aah Corruption alleged in Qadirpur&amp;#8217;s privatisation By Sher Baz Khan Friday, 07 Nov, 2008   02:29 AM PST   ISLAMABAD: Workers union of the Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDCL) has sought the intervention of the prime minister and president to stop the privatisation of Qadirpur Gas Field, which generates $155million annual revenue and accounts for over 30 per cent of OGDCL&amp;#8217;s total gas production. While speaking at a news conference here on Thursday, General Secretary OGDCL (CBA) Mohammad Aqleem Khan and other officer bearers of the union threatened boycotts and protests against the privatisation of what they called the national asset&amp;#8217; and backbone of Pakistan&amp;#8217;s energy generation&amp;#8217; if both the political leaders did not put off the sale of the gas field immediately. We can even sacrifice our lives to save this national asset,&amp;#8217; observed President of the OGDCL&amp;#8217;s Officers Association, Aslam Khan Niazi. If the field was sold to foreign companies they would sell gas $7 per mmbtu (million British thermal unit), while OGDCL was selling at Rs124 per unit. Mr Niazi said that gas would become so much expensive that the fertilisers and chemicals industries of Punjab would not be able to operate. They country would be strangulated economically as the Qadirpur&amp;#8217;s gas to power generation companies would not be available anymore and electricity consumers would have to pay high charges for power generated through thermal. The workers said that it was beyond their comprehension as to what had made the government to decide to put on sale the profit-making&amp;#8217; gas field, in which, they say, British Petroleum and Austria&amp;#8217;s OMV were interested. The union leader said that the Privatisation Commission had valued the total assets of the gas field at $2billion while it&amp;#8217;s real cost was over $7billion. OGDCL has so far extracted 1.7trillion cubic feet from one zone of Qadirpur gas field alone, while two other field were yet to be dug. The OGDCL has put total gas reserves from the field at 2.5 trillion cubic feet. The union leader said that while valuing the gas field, the authorities had not included the value of the remaining two zones which were yet to be put in use by the OGDCL. They accused the authorities&amp;#8217; and big fish&amp;#8217; for eyeing millions of dollars in kick backs&amp;#8217; in case they facilitated the sale of the Qadirpur gas field. This is a scandal bigger than that of the sale of Pakistan Steel Mills, which could not be materialised owing to the timely intervention of the Supreme Court of Pakistan,&amp;#8217; said the union&amp;#8217;s president, Chaudhry Mohammad Akram. He said the workers would also get a stay from the court against the controversial sale of Qadirpur gas field. He said that OGDCL was producing 64 per cent of the total oil production of the country, while the remaining 34 per cent was produced by 30 multinational companies altogether. They said the gas field also paid $40.57million annual royalty, $10.59million in excise duty to the government, $52.3million in sales tax and $79.08million in income tax. Its sale would create numerous problems for the country within a few years and its industry would crumble like a house of cards, he warned and appealed to all the industrialists of the country to come out and oppose the sale of the gas field for the sake of Pakistan&amp;#8217;s future. http://www.dawn.net/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn%20Content%20Library/dawn/news/pakistan/privatization+of+three+state-owned+entities+approved-wk Privatisation of three state-owned entities approved By Mubarak Zeb Khan Friday, 07 Nov, 2008   10:21 PM PST   ISLAMABAD, Nov 7: Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani on Friday approved privatisation of three strategically important state-owned entities&amp;#8212; Qadirpur Gas Field, Small and Medium Bank, and Heavy Electrical Complex&amp;#8211; for raising funds to overcome the balance of payment crisis. As one of the strong conditionality, the decisions of privatisation came two days ahead of the scheduled meeting of the executive board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which will take decision regarding loan and term and conditions to help Pakistan pay its foreign debts in the next couple of years. But, the government took the decision despite strong criticism from the unions of these entities, who already threatened boycotts and protests against the privatization of what they called the national assets&amp;#8217; and backbone of the country&amp;#8217;s energy. As members of the opposition during the past 10 years, PPP leaders had always questioned the sale of state owned entities and asked for a parliamentary debate before making any transactions. This latest move by the PPP government presents a stark contrast to their previous stance. Pakistan requires foreign aid worth $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion for repayment of its debts in the current fiscal year. A similar deficit is also expected for next year. Chairing the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCOP), Prime Minister Gilani gave the go ahead for initiating the process for privatising 37 per cent shares of the Oil and Gas Development Company Limited&amp;#8217;s (OGDCL) Qadirpur Gas field with transfer of operational control. The CCOP also allowed the bidding of Heavy Electrical Complex (HEC) and Small &amp;amp; Medium Enterprises (SME) Bank. &amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
