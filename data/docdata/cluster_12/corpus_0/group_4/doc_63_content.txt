The Manila Standardhttp://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=news6_nov14_2008BUSINESS outsourcing may not be the most glamorous industry in the world, but it is one of the few bright lights amid the doom and gloom of the global financial crisis.The two countries that have benefited the most from outsourcing, India and the Philippines, expect to see some initial pain from the financial turmoil, but the industry is confident it will ride out the storm.In the Philippines the business process outsourcing industry expects growth this year of between 35 percent and 40 percent on revenues of around $7 billion.We are part of the solution, not part of the problem, Oscar Sanez, the chief executive of the Business Processing Association of the Philippines, said in a recent interview.The sector expects annual growth of around 40 percent with revenues hitting $12 billion by 2010 and employing one million people compared with 300,000 this year.In India, where the industry generates some $40 billion in annual export revenues, the story is much the same, although it admits that it could expect some initial pain.The sector traditionally views bad times as offering opportunities as Western companies cut costs by moving work to cheaper destinations offshore.India leads the world when it comes to outsourcing with more than half the global business, while the Philippines is a distant second with around 10 percent.Both countries place a great deal of importance on the sector as its growth creates jobs and much-needed revenue.Rick Santos, the Philippine country chairman for global property services company CB Richard Ellis, told Agence France-Presse that the crisis would actually drive more BPO business to the Philippines.You will see many more companies having to go offshore just to survive, he said.He said he expected about 502,000 square meters of Philippine office space to be leased this year, up 52 percent from 2007.India and the Philippines are the preferred destinations for European and American banks, and IT companies for outsourcing their back room and call center operations due to the highly educated work force and English-speaking skills in both countries.Sanez said that despite the financial turmoil he was confident the BPO industry in the Philippines would continue to see growth.Judging from the investor meetings weve been having recently, our clients will want to ramp up their outsourcing activities in order to accelerate cost savings, he said.The Philippines is in a very strategic position due to its strong and successful experience with BPO, particularly with large American and British multinationals giving it a high level of credibility and trust especially in critical times.He conceded that in the short term, there could be a bit of distraction due to management and ownership realignments in the banking sector.But this should not affect outsourcing operations as these are critical functions, especially those that connect with customers, he said.Some 85 percent of the BPO business in the Philippines is in banking and comes mainly from the United States.In India the BPO industry expects there will be a short- to medium-term impact on the sector as much of its business is IT-related.Some of the pain from the bankruptcy of Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers, the sale of Merrill Lynch and the US governments bailout of insurance giant AIGall ravaged by credit woesis already being felt, industry sources say.But its still very much a mixed picture in India where companies are at best cautious on the outlook for the sector and not peering too far into the future because they say that all the dominoes have yet to fall.
