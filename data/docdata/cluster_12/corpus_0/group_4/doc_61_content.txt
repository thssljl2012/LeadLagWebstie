   Professor Paul Secunda over at Workplace Prof Blog wrote an interesting Nov. 3, 2008 story entitled Facebook and Work Do Not Mix Part Deux. It is about employers firing employees for comments they may have made on Facebook. Paul questions whether the employees would have a cause of action.   Unfortunately, for most employees who are employed at will, the answer will be know. Employees covered under a CBA just cause standard may (will) fare better as most arbitrators require a nexus to work to sustain discipline. Even in states that have off duty statutes, such as New York Labor Law Sec. 201-d there is a huge exception for conduct that causes a conflict of interest. Is disparaging your employer a conflict of interest?? Probably not as they are two different concepts. However, I am sure this will be litigated.  Mitchell H. Rubinstein
