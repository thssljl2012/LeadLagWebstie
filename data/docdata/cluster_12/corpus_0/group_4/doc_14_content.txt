Word from Fiji is that Frank Bainimarama&amp;#8217;s regime has gone on a car razy buying spree, more than 200 cars to be exact, before the 2009 budget announcement later this month by it&amp;#8217;s coup-maker interim Minister of Finance, Frank himself. Sources from Fiji&amp;#8217;s ministry of money say they had allocated $15 million for this car purchase exercise and guess whose got it all! Yep, Col Aziz Mohammed and the hypocritical wannabee holy man, Freddie Keshwan. Reliable sources say that Col Aziz and Freddie in cohorts with Frank and Aiyaz Khaiyum were able to redirect all that government vehicle purchase business toMerchant Bank. Aziz is the Chairman of Merchant while Freddie is its $400,000 CEO. Their argument was that taxpayers money needed to flow back to a local company owned by locals which is fair enough. But thestench is this. Merchant Bank&amp;#8217;s interest rate is 18% while other banks like ANZ and Westpac are offering much lower rates at 10%-13%. ANZ and Westpac are in better positions to offer more discount due to their sheer size which Merchant doesn&amp;#8217;t have. So why would Frank want tothrow away more scarce taxpayers money to Col Aziz and Freddie when he canget a much cheaper deal with other banks? It&amp;#8217;s because Aziz, Freddie, Sereana Qoro, Frank and his supporters are playing a tit-for-tat game with Australia, New Zealand, USA and other countries that still have them on travel, education and otherbans. ANZ and Westpac are foreign owned banks with its shareholders made up of mostly institutional and individual investors from these countries. Naturally, Frank and Co. will try to block doing business with these foreign companies, just like how they tried to kill Fiji Water, a company owned by the Resnicks of USA. Another reason why Frank is signing off $15million to Merchant Bank is because he wants to artificially prop up the financial results of the company controlled by himself and his boys and girls in Aziz Mohammed, Freddie Keshwan, Sereana Qoro, and their Board members. Again, all these at the expense of the taxpayers with hardly any new money created by these coup supportersthrough new investments or new economic activities to pump fresh crispy money into the depressed Fiji economy. And there is more to it. In return forFrank&amp;#8217;smilitarygovernment vehicle purchase business, Aziz Mohammed, Freddie Keshwan and Sereana Qoro will reward their master by selling Frank their Merchant Finance house, once a home to ousted Prime Minister Qarase at a ridiculously below market price. That Merchant Bank house was advertised once for tender only a few weeks ago but sources say that that was only procedural with the buyer already identified as Frank Bainimarama. Apparently, these sources say that the said house is right next to Ballu Khan&amp;#8217;s house he recently sold at more than $1 million dollars to one Manubhai family which means that the sale would have pumped up the value of properties next to it and around it, including this soon to be Frank&amp;#8217;s house. These sources said a similar kind of deal was made by Siti Rabuka when he was Prime Minister and incidentally, it wasa property located near thiscontroversial Merchant Bankhouse in Muanikau. And guess whose going to finance Frank&amp;#8217;s Muanikau home purchase! Yep, Merchant Bank again.
