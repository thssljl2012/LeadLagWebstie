 PSFK - Trends PSFK is excited to announce Steve Roberts, CEO and Founder of ShopText, as a speaker in our Good Ideas in 2009 Salon.  Steve will be participating in our first discussion surrounding ideas and innovations in the Mobile space on the morning of Tuesday, November 18th. ShopText has developed a technology that brings the shopping experience directly to the cell phone, enabling consumers and brands to interact via text message.  This new model literally takes retail anywhere, to a point where brick and mortar stores and even internet connections are no longer necessary. Steve Roberts launched ShopText in November 2006. Prior to ShopText, Steves marketing and internet experience includes COO of McCann Ericksons $200 million relationship marketing company MRM Partners, CFO of McCanns $650 million marketing services companies and CFO of Modem Media (acquired by Digitas in 2004), where he led the companys IPO in 1999, and drove its profitable growth to a run rate of $160 million in revenue. Prior to Modem Media, Steve held several global and international PL management positions at United Technologies. Prior to joining UTC in 1990, Steve structured debt financing for radio, paging, cable and newspaper acquisitions and leveraged buyouts in the Corporate Finance Group of Continental Bank (now Bank of America). Steve has an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago and a B.A. from Middlebury College. Tickets for this and all other Good Ideas in 2009 Salons are available for purchase here.Similar posts:  barbie girl
