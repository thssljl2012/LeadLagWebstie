I&amp;nbsp;am thoroughly furious with Religious organizations. We now need to get a bill through the California Legislature that does not allow religious organizations to create or donate to any political campaign. While that's going to take a while, here's something that we can all do immediately.GANK THIS ON TO YOUR JOURNAL AND PASS IT ONThe Mormon Church and its members were some of the largest donors in the Prop 8 measure. As many of your know, Mormon church members are required to tithe a portion of their income to the Church. Universely, we need to avoid putting any more money into the Church's coffers by boycotting all companies where a Mormon church member holds an officer's position or a large majority interest. This includes:MARRIOTT HOTELSPRICELINE.COMALBERTSONS GROCERY STORESK-SWISS SHOESHOUSE OF FABRICSNATIONWIDE INSURANCE INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES SUCH AS ALLIED.SWIFT TRANSPORTATIONEARTH SHELLCORVISHUNTSMAN CHEMICALOAKLEYNPS PHARMECEUTICALSMEGAHERTZ CORPORATIONCORNERSTONE REALTY INCOME TRUSTKNIGHT TRANSPORTATION (TRUCKING)MERIT MEDICALPLUS all those companies that are directly owned by the MORMON CHURCH outside of Utah, many of which are FOR PROFIT.Join the effort and put your dollars into non-Mormon companies that deserve your support!
