Recently the privately owned Mission Viejo Country Club sold a seven acre parcel of their land for around $20 million to a private developer. Following is an update on this proposed housing development from Mission Viejo city manager Dennis Wilberg. UPDATE ON MISSION VIEJO COUNTRY CLUB PARCEL &amp;#8220;On October 14, Planning, Public Works, and Public Services staff met with Salim Rahemtula of Watermarke Properties and several of his project consultants regarding the seven-acre parcel they purchased from the Mission Viejo Country Club at Oso Parkway and Montonoso drive. Mr. Rahemtulla stated their current proposal is to construct a 250-unit apartment project with 32 affordable units.  The project name is AndalucIa at Mission Viejo. The proposed project would be a combination of one and two bedroom units. The front building off Oso Parkway would be 3 to 4 stories in height, and the back building near the Mission Viejo Country Club upper parking lot would be 4 stories in height. The proposed project assumes a partial density bonus with relief requested for building height. They are interested in using our CbA 20% set-aside funds to offset project-related costs and have been working with Jim Williams and Celeste Brady on various development scenarios for their pro-forma. Mr. Rahmetulla indicated they would like to secure entitlement permits from the City by next January.&amp;#8221; Gilbert comment. Without seeing the plans for parking, park space set-aside, access for fire and emergency vehicles, etc. I will take a wait and see approach to see how this is handled by the planning commission and our city council majority where we already have concerns about future development in our &amp;#8220;built out&amp;#8221; city. Note: There is no on street parking in this area of our city. Note: How timely that councilman, and new real estate salesman, John Ledesma just promoted a waiver of developer fees at our last two meetings!
