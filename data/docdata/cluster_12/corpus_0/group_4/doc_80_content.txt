Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn ran this screen cap, noting that Forest City Enterprises's share price reached an over-ten-year low yesterday, closing at 5.56.    It is worth noting that Barclays Global Investors UK Holdings Ltd., an investment management subsidiary of Barclays Bank, which just publicly reaffirmed the lucrative naming rights deal for a new arena in Brooklyn, not long ago became one of the largest institutional investors in Forest City Enterprises.    On June 30, 2008 Barclays Global Investors purchased 2,440,986 shares at $32.21 for a total investment of $78,648,568.  The current value is estimated around $13,571,882.    Since Barclays is so bullish about the project, might they double down while the stock is cheap?
