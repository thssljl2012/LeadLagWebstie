On Friday, Forest presented at a Bank of America conference and the webcast is posted on their site here.  After the prepared presentation, an analyst asked what risks remain with their Utica Shale play?  Forest stated that the main risk was that the horizontals wouldn't produce at expected rates but that the early testing results are "encouraging".  This most likely accounts for the increased volume and price gains the juniors saw on Friday afternoon and bodes well for the weeks ahead leading up to the Forest announcement sometime over the next 45 days.
