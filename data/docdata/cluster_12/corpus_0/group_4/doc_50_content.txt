President elect Barack Obama appointed Rep. Rahm Emanuel as his future White House Chief of Staff. The move indicates Obama has not yet extricated himself from those dirty D.C. waters. Below is a list of Mr. Emanuel's top contributors. They have a distinctly Wall Street vs. Main Street flavor. As you peruse the list, note the presence of the bailout boys, as well as numerous private equity underwriters (PEU's).Congressman Rahm Emanuel2008 Election CycleContributor TotalUBS AG $63,700AT&amp;T Inc $49,950Blackstone Group $47,000JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co $45,700Grosvenor Capital Management $38,900Goldman Sachs $32,950Citigroup Inc $28,500Lehman Brothers $27,600National Amusements Inc $26,900Texas Pacific Group $23,000Merrill Lynch $20,800Mf Global $20,400CME Group $19,650Carlyle Group $16,250Morgan Stanley $16,200Evercore Partners $16,100Madison Dearborn Partners $16,100Bank of America $16,000Kirkland &amp; Ellis $15,500Bailey Perrin Bailey LLP $13,800Eton Park Capital Management $13,800Get out of the pool, Barack! It's the same filthy water you mentioned early in your campaign. Last night, you asked the public to keep you clean in your inspirational acceptance speech. I'm complying. Don't ask, if you don't want to be told. It doesn't look like that "new dawn of American leadership" has broken.
