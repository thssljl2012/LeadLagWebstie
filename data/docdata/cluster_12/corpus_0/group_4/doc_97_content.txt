                        Citibank started its generally meaningless Live Richly advertising campaign in 2001. The campaign strategy was to urge customers to not work hard, not consider money to be all that important, and to find meaning and value in their lives through relationships with loved ones, rather than through conspicuous consumption. A few years later that campaign was largely superceded by a new flavor of the month campaign revolving around identity theft. Remember Identify theft? When that didnt work they resorted to things like online bill-pay instant Win games.In April 2007, after months of research, the bank settled on the Lets Get It Done, theme, a strategy which it was hoped would get customers to use more of Citis services to get it done and a rallying cry for employees to get behind the banks apparent turnaround. After a 2-month $30 million advertising flight, the strategy did not, in fact, get it done for the bank.       And so, after nearly three decades in mothballs, and more than $451 million in brand advertising in 2007, Citigroup is resurrecting the theme, The Citi Never Sleeps, the campaign that was used to usher in the original A.T.M. and 24-hour banking.But as anyone who watches the news or reads the papers knows, Citigroups troubles are somewhat larger than their ill-conceived advertising strategies. According to the most recent Customer Loyalty Engagement Index, Citi ranks last among some formidable competitors. Ranking are as follows:   Bank      of AmericaJP      Morgan ChaseWachoviaPNC/Bank      of NY Wells      FargoWashington      Mutual Citi         In addition to a general lack of meaning or differentiation among consumers, and loan problems contributing to about $20 billion in losses, the bank apparently has problems in integrating the many pieces of the company that were sutured together over the last couple of decades. And with investors battering Citibanks shares (close to $2 last week), the government stepped in Sunday night with a plan to rescue what was once the nations most powerful bank.    Financial experts have suggested that it would not be surprising to see a public backlash emerge over the rescue plan, specifically in requiring neither a change in top management nor the sale of parts of the bank and for privatizing profits made from the banks high-risk bets, but placing losses on the taxpayers shoulders. All of which will require real and actionable engagement with the brand  something beyond an expensive new advertising campaign. Yes, the Citi never sleeps. And now you know whats keeping it up at night.
