      Finsec members at ANZ have gone on the front foot this week in defence of staffing levels in their branches. Conference calls were held on Wednesday evening for ANZ delegates and members to formulate a plan of action, which is now being put in place. Last weeks announcement came as a bolt from the blue for ANZ staff, said Kelly Smith from ANZ Whakatane, one of Finsecs ANZ retail team on our Union Council. Its been good to talk to Finsec members from around the country and come up with a plan to influence the review of ANZ retail staffing. ANZ staff are now completing a survey to assess how current staffing levels are working, and analyse the impact of reduction of staff numbers. They are also signing petitions to CEO Graeme Hodgson and Managing Director of ANZ Retail Wayne Bezant urging the bank to ensure the branch review delivers decent staffing levels. Finsec members have also been in communications with the bank to ensure that the voluntary redundancy processes are fair and correct.
