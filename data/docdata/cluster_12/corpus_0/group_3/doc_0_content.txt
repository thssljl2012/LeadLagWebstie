AppSense is the leading provider of user environment management solutions for the enterprise. User environment management enables the configuration and personalization of virtual, standard desktops by treating user specific data as a separate layer of the desktop. This user layer is applied as needed and is accessible in any environment. Keeping user data separate means it is no longer tied to a specific machine and so can be applied to any desktop environment when needed. In this way, the user experience remains consistent and predictable while the corporate desktop is standardized and delivery automated. Companies such as Citi, WellSpan, Bank of America, Clifford Chance and HP are using AppSense technology in their virtual environments today.read more
