It looks as if the LloydsTSB takeover ofHBOS is on again, after it wobbled a bit last week. But could the guarantee to keep jobs in Scotlandbe interpreted as racial discrimination? Employment lawyer Matthew Whelan thinks so.When selecting people for redundancy, he argues, ifthe company fires itspeoplein Halifax but protectsthose in Scotland, this could amount to indirect discrimination in favour of Scottish people. Lloyds TSB would have to show a legitimate business reason to justify such discrimination. He concludes: HBOS and Lloyds may have shot themselves in the foot by including this provision in the deal - had it not been made explicit then it may not have been an issue. It could be the wording used - it may not have been so controversial if the statement was on the geographical focus of the new bank, rather than specifically mentioning jobs. There may well be legitimate and carefully considered reasons for this decision which are not apparent from what we know. It also begs the question of whether the banks were aware of the legal risks of the inclusion of this intention. The redundancies are some way off and therefore we will have to wait to see what, if anything, comes of this. I&amp;#8217;m almost certain that something will come of it, especially now that the bankingunions and local MPs are on the case. Whether or not it comes to court remains to be seen. It would be an interesting test case if it did. It is more likely, though,that the threat of legal action will be enough to squeeze further concessions out of the new company and a behind-the-scenes deal will be done. The last thinga newly mergedorganisation needs is a high profile legalcase hanging over it.
