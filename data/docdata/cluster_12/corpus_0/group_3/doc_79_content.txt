Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn    Congressman Dennis Kucinich (D-OH) sent a 16-page letter to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg yesterday (with 12 additional pages of attachments), raising "serious questions" about Yankee Stadium land assessments, PILOTs and tax-exempt financing. Can similar questions about the still-known-as Barclays Center arena be far behind?    DDDB has the press release, along with a link to the Congressman's letter, which also includes a reminder to the Mayor:       I request that the City promptly fully comply with the Subcommittee's requests for   documents that should have been produced on August 6, 2008 &amp;#151; over two months ago &amp;#151; and provide two witnesses for the upcoming Subcommittee hearing.     link
