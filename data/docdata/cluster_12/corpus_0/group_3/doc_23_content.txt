       Pollination  by insects, mainly bees, is worth $217 billion worldwide each year, according  to a study recently published in Ecological Economics and highlighted in Business Week.&amp;nbsp; That's equivalent to  9.5% of the world's crop production. (And two-and-a-half times as much as the  U.S. government's recent  loan to bail out insurance giant AIG, to put it into  perspective.) Interestingly, the study noted that crops that depend on  insect pollinators, like fruits, vegetables, and oilseed crops, are higher in  average value than crops that don't, like cereals and sugar cane.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And the  consequences of pollinator loss on consumer well-being (defined economically)  could be even greater than the direct value of crops pollinated by insects. But the  finding that chilled me to the  bone was the possible consequences for the crop category known as "stimulants."  Because that includes coffee.  ...the  results indicate that for three crop categories - namely fruits, vegetables and  stimulants [coffee, cocoa] - the situation would be considerably altered  following the complete loss of insect pollinators because world production would  no longer be enough to fulfil the needs at their current  levels.  It's  true...coffee  needs bees too.&amp;nbsp; And, like millions of others around the globe, I need  coffee to survive. (Incidentally, the shade-grown coffee that many of us favor because it's friendlier to birds is friendlier to bees as well, attracting close to 10 species of native sweet bees and far more bees than coffee grown in the sun.) Bottom  line: insect pollinators feed us and enhance the quality of our lives.&amp;nbsp; But, in  addition to colony collapse disorder, which is affecting U.S.  honey bees, insect pollinators are in decline all over the world.&amp;nbsp; It's worth  paying attention to their plight.
