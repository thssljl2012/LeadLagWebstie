      I can't stop thinking that the truest and most longest-lasting impact to financial brands won't be investor reputation or trust, but rather the psychological scars on employees.Talk about the ground literally falling out from under their feet.I mean, here we had a large group of well-educated, motivated people who played by the rules, and then the rules changed.&amp;#0160; Dramatically.&amp;#0160; One day, employees from the important to the inconsequential played their parts in running profitable businesses; the next (or after torturous weekends), the businesses were gone.&amp;#0160; And so were the jobs.It must be hard for them to watch all the media coverage of the greed on Wall Street.&amp;#0160; It's accepted wisdom that those employees did something wrong, whatever that something might have been.&amp;#0160; They deserved to lose their jobs because of, well, whatever they did.&amp;#0160; Were they guilty of trying to grow their companies?&amp;#0160; Was it bad that they pursued profits for themselves, their investor, and shareholders? No, of course not.&amp;#0160; It was't even unethical.&amp;#0160; At worst, if at some level the salepeople knew that what they were syndicating as fine food assets actually reeked of rotting fish, could't that be seen as no different than a brand marketer making the purposeful, conscious claim that, say, a cologne or beer drove women mad with desire?These firms had standards, visions and mission statements.&amp;#0160; Their businesses have been regulated and reported upon for many years.&amp;#0160; Outbound marketing relied on implicit standards, if not explicit rules, about the risks and rewards of investing.&amp;#0160; They've spent many millions building name recognition.&amp;#0160; But what does the branding say to the people who are still working those digs?&amp;#0160; How do you repurpose it to recruit new staff once this current meltdown is history?I'm not sure the traditional tools of brand communications are up to the challenge.Hasn't everything changed?&amp;#0160; One could imagine, say, Barclays Capital's 10,000 new Lehman traders and staff as a new business, not an extension of an old brand name.&amp;#0160; A new company needs new definitions not only of principles, but the actual processes and systems that will make them real.&amp;#0160; These are the fundamentals that won't shift if and when the context shifts again.What a great opportunity for a management team to come together and co-invent the behaviors that will define the brands.&amp;#0160; Otherwise, they risk creating great-looking communications that risk leaving the employees behind.
