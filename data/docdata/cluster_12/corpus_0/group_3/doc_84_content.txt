Trust Melbourne (the city that holds Design close to its bosom) to be the home of the latest initiative from ANZ Bank; a Breakout   Learning Centre designed by Hassell.  (http://www.hassell.com.au/en.html)As the title suggests, this large, flexible, multi-purpose space is designed to encourage creativity, however it is in the execution that the freedom from constraints of a normal office environment is apparent. Forget about boring corporate colors, obvious branding and drab office furniture (in the style of hit series The Office).  The furnishings and design of this space use contradictory materials and colors with startling results; plywood, paint and patterned rubber with industrial raw finishes all topped off with a pop of fire engine red or frog green! There is various size meeting rooms depending on the type of learning activity which have state of the art technology to enhance the experience. Perhaps my favorite design features are the Tree of Knowledge and the Giant Foot.  Just like a fairytale, this tree grows between floors in a natural raw shape reminding us that the childlike imagination is where creativity is ripest. The Giant foot sits beneath the tree and reminds us about reality and perception.   Kate Vandermeer
