CALIMAGThe Manila Bulletinhttp://www.mb.com.ph/INFO20081021138444.htmlThe financial crisis may have put the US economy in excruciating agony right now, but this same misery, ironically, stands to benefit the Philippines. The countrys business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, in particular, is expecting a windfall as a result of US firms moving their outsourcing needs to the Philippines where the cost of labor is much cheaper.Industry players, as well as research firms and observers, are one in saying that the American financial crunch could pose no danger to the Philippines and could, in fact, bring in more outsourcing jobs.Benedict Hernandez, president of the Contact Center Association of the Philippines (CCAP), stated in a circular that the growth forecast for the industry remains "robust" at 30 percent this year.The growth figure, according to Hernandez, is based on a mid-year assessment with the groups members, who represent 80 percent of the industry, and from industry suppliers who report about 35 percent growth in orders for their equipment this year."We believe that the global financial situation is driving even more interest from US-based companies in the Philippines as a lower cost and superior quality destination for their contact center outsourcing needs," he stated.Interestingly, Hernandez said some CCAP members have "even reported an increasing interest from other countries like the United Kingdom and Australia to take advantage of a lower-cost, superior value offering of the Philippines."He added: "We are excited to grow to more than 200,000 employees generating over  billion [sic] this year as our industrys contribution to nation building."Oscar Sanez, chief executive of the Business Process Outsourcing Association of the Philippines (BPAP), was also quoted in television saying that the outsourcing sector isnt expecting any slowdown but is actually looking forward to getting more jobs from the US.Canada-quartered IT analyst firm XMG buttressed the industrys assertion, saying IT and the offshoring industry will remain as bright spots in the next two years."Industries such as the financial, insurance and manufacturing industries, which will all take a direct hit by the slowing economy, will slash jobs. This increases the potential talent pool for larger and upbeat business process third party vendors with healthy sales pipeline for business process services," the XMG report said.However, XMG said it has revised its growth forecast for outsourcing to 24.2 percent from the 34 percent it predicted in 2007. The cut, the analyst company said, is due to "reduced investments by captive operations.""The global financial upheaval will have a deleterious effect across most industries, but the IT industry and offshoring specifically will still experience double digit growths," said XMG chief analyst Lauro Vives.He added: "These numbers are rare bright spot during tough times."XMG said the research results are in-line with its expectations that the technology services sector will continue to hold steady regardless of the economic situation."No matter what the economic situation dictates, the sought after resource will always be people and expertise."A lawmaker, meanwhile, said the emergence of JP Morgan Chase as the largest US bank augurs well for the country as it is expected that it would soon offshore more back office jobs to the Philippines.Catanduanes representative Joseph Santiago, chairman of the House information and communications technology committee, said in a statement that JP Morgans acquisition of Washington Mutual Inc. (WaMu) is a boost to the country since WaMu is a key client of call center operator PeopleSupport.PeopleSupport, which was recently acquired by India-based Aegis Corp., runs three call centers in the country and employs around 8,000 Filipino agents."When American firms slash costs due to mergers or an economic slowdown, the first to go tend to be high-paying USbased jobs. They hardly bother to reexamine toward scaling down their low-cost outsourcing activities here, at least not on the basis of cost," he stated."Among US banks, JP Morgan is the most comfortable with the Philippines. The bank has been here for 47 years. It has become totally acclimatized to our political and economic conditions," Santiago noted."Our sense is, now that it has become larger, JP Morgan would be inclined to build up in a big way its contact centers and other back offices here," he added.JP Morgan first outsourced customer support jobs to the Philippines in 2003 by putting up a 900-seat contact center in Makati City. The US bank recently launched a new 1,400-seat contact center in Taguig City.After acquiring Bear Stearnsin March and then WaMu last month, JP Morgan has emerged as the largest US bank in terms of market capitalization, surpassing Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.Santiago, meanwhile, stated he expects the American International Group Inc. (AIG) to sell its local outsourcing subsidiary, AIG Business Processing Services Inc. (AIG-BPSI).AIG-BPSI provides back office operations and contact support services for AIG businesses worldwide.
