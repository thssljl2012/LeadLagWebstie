From the mailbag:   Barclays Capital today "surprised" all of their IT contractors in the US (and quite a few permanent employees on both the Lehman and Barclays sides) with an end of shift termination notice, in typical Lehman fashion.  Managers and vendors alike were forbidden to disclose this info in advance.   Given that the most senior members of just about every IT team with any sort of production support responsibilities WERE contractors (web, server, database, messaging, networks) - it should be interesting to see how the ongoing Lehman integration efforts (and even just BAU activities) proceed after today.
