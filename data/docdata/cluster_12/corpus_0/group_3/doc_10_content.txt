  I had lunch today with my friend and former client from Lehman Brothers-John Ng--who I believe is one of the best 'networkers' and people connectors I have met!  When I worked with John several times over the last few years--I observed his amazing way to navigate throughout the firm-the different populations and create a real synergy between people. He also has a great knack for knowing something about each person and would incorporate that into his introduction and then was able to have a terrific 'exit' strategy as he would move on to others to introduce me to after I spoke at the event and we were practicing our networking skills at the cocktail party.  I had lunch today with John and he is now at&amp;nbsp; Barclays since the closing of Lehman where he spent most of his career after going to college in Minnesota--when he relocated from HongKong where his parents still live. When I met him, he was in procurement and I do know--(an excellent negotiator) and now is in the global real estate group. He is a true professional&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;jng@barclayscapital.com  Our story today was such a great reminder of 'creating an ice breaker'--as we sat down and started to order, I noticed John's shirt had an interesting monogram--- I found out it was his name in Chinese!&amp;nbsp; I saw the unique lettering and asked him about it and as he smiled and told me the meaning, we both agreed---'what a terrific way to begin a conversation!'  Like I said--John Ng is one of those individuals that truly embraces the true power of relationship building and networking!! I know I will always remember the monogram on his shirts!!
