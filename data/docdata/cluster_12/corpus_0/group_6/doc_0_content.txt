     As the old Sesame St song goes, one of these things is not like the others. And the odd one out in terms of pay is PSIS, which lags well behind the banking industry ?for example, between 9 and 20% less than comparable roles at ANZ National Bank. In previous years, PSIS members have pushed for greater pay parity with their colleagues working in the banks. While good pay increases have been achieved, pay parity looks set to be a key priority for 2009. Finsec members at PSIS will start off a big year of negotiations (BNZ, Westpac, ANZ National all to follow) with on-site meetings in the last two weeks of January to discuss the most important issues they want addressed as part of their collective employment agreement. Finsec members can check the date of their meeting here: http://www.finsec.org.nz/PSIS/PSIS%20Claims%20Meeting%20Schedule%20Jan%2009.pdf Staff will also be signing a collective letter to the PSIS board, asking for parity with similar jobs in the banks and seeking an agreement between PSIS and Finsec on how we can work together in future.
