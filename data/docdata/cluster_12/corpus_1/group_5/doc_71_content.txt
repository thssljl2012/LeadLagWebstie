SEOUL, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Citibank Korea, a unit of Citigroup , will receive capital from its parent to lift its capital ratio, a source from the bank with knowledge of the plan said on Friday, without giving the amount of fresh funding.  'Details will be announced early next week,' he said by telephone, asking not to be identified before the announcement.  Citibank was spotted selling dollars in South Korea's foreign exchange market to fund the capital increase, a dealer said.  Local media outlet Yonhap Infomax reported Citigroup   (nyse: C -  news  -  people ) was set to inject about $400 million-$500 million into its local unit.
