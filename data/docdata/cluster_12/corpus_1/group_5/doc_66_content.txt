Citi announced the completion of the sale of Citibank Privatkunden AG &amp;amp; Co. KGaA, its German retail banking operation, and certain of its affiliates, to Crdit Mutuel-CIC, a French banking group.   Crdit Mutuel-CIC paid an all-cash consideration of $6.6 billion, which includes an estimate of 2008 earnings through closing. The transaction results in an estimated after-tax gain of approximately $4 billion, including the impact of a benefit of a currency hedge put in place post-signing.   Citi said its Tier 1 capital ratio for the third quarter ended September 30, 2008, on a pro forma basis for the close of the transaction is expected to be higher by approximately 60 basis points.   Commenting on the sale, Citi's chief executive Vikram Pandit said, 'The transaction is another strategic step that significantly strengthens Citi's key capital ratios and allows us to reallocate capital to the best growth opportunities for the overall franchise.' The operations sold to Crdit Mutuel-CIC have assets of $15.6 billion and deposits of $11.8 billion at current foreign exchange rates. It had 3.25 million customers, 6,800 employees and operates 340 locations, including branches and advisory centers, throughout Germany.
