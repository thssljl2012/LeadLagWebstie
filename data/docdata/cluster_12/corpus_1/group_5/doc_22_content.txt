The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) said it would not block the proposed acquisition of BankWest and St Andrew's by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). The watchdog said due to current economic conditions, BankWest could no longer compete as aggressively.  ACCC chairman Graeme Samuel said that prior to the global financial crisis, BankWest, a subsidiary of the United Kingdom bank HBOS, was a keen competitor in the marketplace, but international events had overtaken the Australian operation.  'Until recently, the bank was in the process of significantly expanding its presence from its home state of Western Australia into the eastern states through a major branch roll out,' he noted.  However, the ACCC said it received evidence that BankWest's expansion plans were to be significantly scaled back, as a result of the funding difficulties experienced by its UK parent.  The ACCC considered information provided by BankWest that its aggressive pricing was driven by its east coast expansion strategy.  The watchdog said it also examined whether alternative buyers for BankWest would be likely to continue with BankWest's expansion strategy and aggressive price competition.  'Following inquiries with financial regulators, BankWest's parent company, Australian and overseas banks and other consortia which may have had an interest in acquiring BankWest, the ACCC concluded that an alternative buyer was unlikely in the current funding environment,' the watchdog said.  The ACCC also concluded that, even if another buyer were in a position to acquire the business, it was highly unlikely that they would choose to invest the capital necessary to continue with its expansion plans.  However, the ACCC expressed that its decision today should not be viewed as a green light to the acquisition of other regional banks by the big four.  'The ACCC will closely analyse the competition implications of any further proposed acquisitions of regional banks,' the regulatory group said.  On Wednesday, CBA closed $1.50 or 5% lower at $28.50.
