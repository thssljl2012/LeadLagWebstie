Oregon State Economist Tom Potiowsky and Logan Taylor, a Bank of America vice president with the bank's derivative-products group, provided their outlooks on the economy at a Friday luncheon sponsored by Salem City Club.  Both observers of the economy predicted the recession would continue well into next year, but they also saw a few good omens.  Potiowsky, whose economic forecasts are used to set state policy, said he anticipates that Oregon will see job losses through the third quarter of 2009. It may be 2010 before Oregonians feel confident about the economy and modest job growth returns, he said.  Despite recent declines in energy and other commodity prices, skittish consumers have been reluctant to spend money.  'We kept harping on them in boom times, 'You need to save, you need to save!' Now, they decide to save,' Potiowsky said.  Oregon is well-positioned to benefit from the economic stimulus programs that the Obama administration is expected to roll out next year, Potiowsky said. The programs to upgrade the nation's infrastructure are expected to emphasize sustainable development, one of Oregon's strengths, he said.  Bank of America's Taylor said loose lending standards and complex financial products set the stage for the downturn.  Bankers became enamored with products such as credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations that are so complicated that they often confuse financial professionals.  The more complex the product, the more attractive it seemed to be to Taylor's peers, he said.  'I think banks are being much more thoughtful, much more careful, about the risks they are taking,' Taylor said. 'Long-term, I think that's a positive.'  mrose@StatesmanJournal.comor (503)399-6657  November jobless rate  The latest state unemployment statistics are expected to be released next week.
