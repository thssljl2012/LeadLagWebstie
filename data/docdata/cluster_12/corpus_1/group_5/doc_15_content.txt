Westpac successfully raised A$2.5 billion through an issue of new shares on Tuesday at an 11% discount to its previous share price, increasing its tier 1 capital ratio to 8.32%.  (CBA), which owns ASB, is widely seen as the next bank likely to raise fresh capital to lift its tier one ratio over the 8% threshold now seen as necessary for Australian banks.  The share prices of CBA, ANZ and NAB lost 8%, 5% and 5% respectively on Tuesday after Westpacs announcement forced many investors to the realisation that capital raisings would be necessary for some to keep their tier one capital ratios above 8%. CBAs tier one ratio was 7.5% at its last trading update.  Westpac said its share issue at A$16 a share was heavily oversubscribed.
