OPES Prime's liquidator will reopen mediation talks between ANZ and Merrill Lynch over the next month in an effort to secure a settlement on behalf of creditors for the role the two companies played in funding the collapsed stock-lending firm.  The move comes as ANZ faces further legal headaches in the US after a class action was filed against the bank and its top executives yesterday, claiming the lender misled US investors by failing to disclose the risks associated with its $650 million exposure to Opes Prime.  The claim, lodged in a New York court, is for unspecified damages and names chairman Charles Goode, chief executive Michael Smith and chief financial officer Peter Marriot among defendants.  A Florida-based law firm, Vianale &amp;amp; Vianale, which specialises in securities claims, filed the suit on behalf of investors who acquired ANZ's US-listed shares between March 2007 and July.  The complaint alleges ANZ and its executives violated US securities laws by 'disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts'.  'The lawsuit charges that ANZ failed to disclose its exposure to risk, given all the money it had lent to Opes Prime,' Kenneth Vianale, principal of the firm, told BusinessDay.  'While the company said they were managing that risk, they weren't.'  An ANZ spokesman said the bank intended to vigorously defend the action. He labelled the lawsuit as 'incomprehensible' because the issues surrounding Opes Prime did not result in any material financial loss to the bank.  While ANZ's provision bill ran up to nearly $2 billion over the past year, Opes Prime represents only a fraction of any losses.  The bulk of write-offs were linked to other problem corporate exposures and credit protection against a series of corporate bond trades.  In Australia, ANZ is facing at least two class actions from aggrieved Opes Prime customers, both of which are expected to play out over years.  But the bank could secure a significant reprieve after Opes Prime liquidator John Lindholm, of insolvency firm Ferrier Hodgson, agreed to re-enter mediation despite initial efforts at a settlement collapsing in October.  Mr Lindholm has previously demanded ANZ and Merrill Lynch pay more than $300 million to resolve the creditors' claims, a sum the banks rejected as unrealistic. Details of the latest settlement claims remain confidential.  Mr Lindholm has previously argued that ANZ unfairly changed the terms of its share-lending contracts with Opes Prime just before the broker collapsed, bolstering its security when the company was already insolvent.  He has also accused Merrill Lynch of rewriting a charge with Opes that was put in place more than a year earlier but never registered. Both companies have denied any wrongdoing.  'In the interest of avoiding a protracted and costly litigation, it has been agreed by ANZ, Merrill Lynch and the liquidators to reconvene the mediation,' Mr Lindholm said.  If a settlement cannot be reached by the end of January, Mr Lindholm said he would launch legal proceedings against ANZ and Merrill Lynch.  Mediation talks will again be overseen by Alex Chernov, QC.  Opes Prime collapsed in March, prompting ANZ and Merrill to seize shares worth $1.5 billion from customers of the creditors and sell them to recover their secured debts.
