Where MidCoast has at times had up to $80 million invested, it currently has around $56 million, with organisations such as Deutsche Bank and Macquarie Bank.  It has been selling off some of its investments since last Christmas because it believed 'the time was right', Mr Hanington explained.  'We've made some excellent money up till now. We have managed our investments well, and seen a good return for them over the last four years in particular.  In the last four years, for example, MidCoast has made over $4.25 million in bank bill rates, he said.  'Not one of the financial people we deal with saw the January credit crunch coming,' he said of the collapse of the US sub prime market which fuelled the world downturn.  The two $1 million cash investments MidCoast has now lost (or all but $109,000 of it) were with portfolios through with the Commonwealth Bank and the ANZ.  No-one could have predicted such an outcome when dealing with two of Australia's most popular banking institutions, Mr Hanington said.  The ANZ Bank-issued Aldo Floating Rate Note which MidCoast invested in to the tune of $1 million will return about $109,000, while the Commonwealth Bank-issued Palladin CDO of $1 million will have a nil return of capital.  'This is very disappointing as both products were placed with two of Australia's leading banks and still fall outside their own capital protection mechanisms, and the guarantees recently introduced by the Australian government.'  They had AAA or close to AAA ratings, and therefore were considered 'safer' than other investments available at the time.  'Council invested in these products because at the time the deals were both rated higher than any Australian bank, with higher than benchmark returns, and - based on historical data for such a rating - at very little risk of default.'  While MidCoast had no direct exposure to the US sub prime markets, the fallout from the sub prime crisis affected Aldo's Floating Rate Note (FRN) and led to a return of investors of $109,195 for every million dollars invested.
