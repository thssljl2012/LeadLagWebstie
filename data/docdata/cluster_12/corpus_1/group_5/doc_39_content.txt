France's second-largest retail bank, Credit Mutuel-CIC, has purchased the German branch of the American financial conglomerate Citigroup for 5.2 billion euros.  In a statement on Friday, Citigroup said the deal was all-cash and involved its German retail banking operation, Citibank Privatkunden, and some of its affiliates.  Credit Mutuel said the purchase would give it a strong foothold in the German consumer credit sector with more than seven percent of the market.  Credit Mutuel has more than 5,000 branch offices in France and employs nearly 60,000 people.  In 2007, it recorded profits of 2.73 billion euros.
