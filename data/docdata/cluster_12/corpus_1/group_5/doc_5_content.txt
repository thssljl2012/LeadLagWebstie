The Australian government's special purpose vehicle will be established as a financing trust, which will provide liquidity to car dealer financiers, through the securitization of eligible loans provided to car dealers.  The government's special purpose vehicle plan is expected to be established by January 1, 2009.  Moray McDonald, managing director of Esanda, said: 'We are pleased to lend our dealer funding expertise to the government's policy development. After the trauma of losing their financiers, these dealers want a committed partner. We expect a lot of interest and we would encourage dealers to talk to us now.'  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, or ANZ, has announced that it plans to help auto dealers and their customers as part of the assistance plan announced by the federal government. Through its wholly owned subsidiary Esanda, ANZ said that it will help fill funding gaps to commercially viable car dealerships following the withdrawal of GE Money Motor Solutions and GMAC from the Australian market.
