SYDNEY, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Macquarie Bank, Australia's top investment bank, has added US$400 million to an offer of government-guaranteed bonds, according to a market source, bringing the total issue size to US$2.1 billion. Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group also added more to its US$1.75 billion government bond issue sold last week with a US$100 million increase, according to a joint lead. The new issue size is now US$1.85 billion. Aussie banks are rushing to raise funds worldwide under a new government guarantee put in place late November to help banks weather the global credit crisis. A total of US$9.4 billion in government-guaranteed bonds has been raised by Australian bank. (See for details). The Macquarie bond increase followed demand from investors in the U.S., the Middle East and Asia, the source close to the deal said. The extra bonds were sold to fund managers, central banks and banks. The increased offer brought the number of investors in the deal to more than 35, with over half in the U.S and the rest in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. More than 50 percent of the total offer, including the increase, was bought by fund managers, the source said. The increase is expected to boost the offer's liquidity now that its size allows the securities to be eligible for electronic trading in the U.S., the source said.
