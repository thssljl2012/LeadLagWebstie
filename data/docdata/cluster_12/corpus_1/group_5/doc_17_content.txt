 Overseas companies may buy into fast-growing regional financial institution Bank of Queensland Ltd (BoQ), taking advantage of the low share price and weak Australian dollar, an analyst says.  BoQ launched a review on Thursday to investigate ways to maintain growth, including takeover opportunities and strategic partnerships as the Brisbane-based lender aims to fill the vacuum left by St George and BankWest. 'Given BoQ's PE (price equity ratio) (is) trading around its all time historical low at 9.5-times for fiscal 2009, and the weakness of the Australian dollar, offshore investment in BoQ cannot be ruled out,' Goldman Sachs JBWere analysts Ben Koo, James Freeman and Elizabeth Rogers wrote in a note to clients.  The bank was trading at a premium, compared with the banking sector, because of the possibility of another company buying a stake, the analysts said. They rate BoQ a 'hold'. BoQ shares were trading at 81 cents, or 7.9 per cent, at $9.44 at 14175 AEDT.  The stock, which has slumped 47 per cent this year, reached a five-year low of $9.34 on December 2.
