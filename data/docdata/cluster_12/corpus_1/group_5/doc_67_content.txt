DUBLIN, Ireland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/d53177/ukrainian_banks) has announced the addition of the '' report to their offering.  During the first three months of 2008, Ukrainian banks continued growing at the solid pace they posted last year.  Banking sector assets grew xx% yoy to reach USD xx bln as of April 1, 2008. Banks loan portfolios expanded by xx% yoy to USD xx bln, mostly driven by a xx% yoy increase in retail loans to USD xx bln. Growth in customers' deposits accelerated to xx% yoy to USD xx bln and banks' equity rose by xx% yoy to reach USD xx bln. The sector's net income increased by xx% yoy to USD xx bln.  The key drivers for the earnings growth remained net interest income (+xx% yoy to USD xx bln), fee &amp;amp; commission income (+xx% yoy to USD xx bln) and further efficiency improvement (Cost/Income fell to xx% from xx% a year ago).  However, Ukrainian banks face two main challenges: Tougher access to the international borrowing pool, which has forced most Ukrainian banks to postpone plans to raise foreign debt  The National Bank of Ukraine, as it clamped down on the money supply to curb accelerating inflation, sucked excessive liquidity from the market. Banks funding bases halved over the last 6M  Under current market conditions, we think foreign-owned banks, which are continuing to tap external markets for financing and halving their borrowing costs, are best positioned. In an environment of falling NIMs, we also favor lenders with strong fee &amp;amp; commission generation and room for efficiency improvement.  We apply the Gordon Growth Model and peer valuation methods to value Ukrainian banks.
