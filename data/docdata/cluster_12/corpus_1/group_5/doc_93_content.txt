ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., Dec. 11 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- EMCORE Corporation (Nasdaq: EMKR), a leading provider of compound semiconductor-based components and subsystems for the broadband, fiber optic, satellite, and terrestrial solar power markets, today announced preliminary unaudited financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2008.  Fiscal Year 2008:  For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, consolidated revenue increased by $69.7 million, or 41%, to $239.3 million from $169.6 million as reported in the prior year. International revenue increased by $48.8 million, or 107%, to $94.4 million from $45.6 million when compared to the prior year. Both of the Company's reporting segments experienced an increase in annual revenue when compared to the prior year. Annual revenue for the Fiber Optics segment increased by $60.9 million, or 55%, to $171.3 million from $110.4 million as reported in the prior year. The increase in Fiber Optics annual revenue was primarily due to incremental revenues associated with the growth of the Company's parallel optical transceiver business and acquisitions completed during the year, which added approximately $41.6 million of revenue in fiscal 2008. In February and April 2008, EMCORE acquired the telecom, datacom, and optical cable interconnects-related assets of Intel Corporation's Optical Platform Division (the 'Intel Acquisitions'). On an annual basis, Fiber Optics revenue represented 72% and 65% of the Company's total consolidated revenue for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. Annual revenue for the Photovoltaics segment increased by $8.8 million, or 15%, to $68.0 million from $59.2 million as reported in the prior year. The increase in Photovoltaics annual revenue was primarily due to EMCORE's recently launched concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) terrestrial-based components (solar cells and receivers) and solar power systems products. U.S. government contract revenue decreased by $8.8 million, or 43%, to $11.6 million from $20.4 million, as reported in the prior year, due to the termination of engineering and manufacturing contracts. On an annual basis, Photovoltaics revenue represented 28% and 35% of the Company's total consolidated revenue for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, consolidated gross profit decreased by $0.5 million, or 2%, to $29.9 million from $30.4 million as reported in the prior year. Consolidated gross margins decreased from 17.9% in fiscal 2007 to 12.5% in fiscal 2008. On a segment basis, annual Fiber Optics gross margins increased from 18.4% to 20.7% which was primarily due to increased revenue which provided a greater base on which to allocate certain fixed costs, benefits associated from the use of contract manufacturers and better utilization of our China manufacturing facility. Gross margins also increased due to the implementation of certain cost reduction initiatives and improved efficiencies driven by facility consolidations. Our Fiber Optics segment also incurred approximately $5.4 million in expenses related to inventory write-downs and product warranty accruals in fiscal 2008. Annual Photovoltaics gross margins decreased from 17.0% in fiscal 2007 to a negative 8.3% in fiscal 2008 due to significant project losses on several initial CPV solar power systems installation projects, which was primarily the result of higher than expected material, freight and installation costs. Our Photovoltaics segment also incurred approximately $13.5 million in expenses related to inventory write-downs, contract losses, and product warranty accruals associated with our CPV-related business in fiscal 2008. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, selling, general, and administrative (SG&amp;amp;A) expenses decreased by $14.2 million, or 25%, to $43.6 million from $57.8 million as reported in the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, SG&amp;amp;A expenses decreased from 34.1% to 18.2%. The decrease in annual SG&amp;amp;A expenses was primarily due to a reduction of non-recurring legal and professional fees of approximately $17.4 million associated with the Company's review of historical stock option grants and patent litigation in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, approximately $7.6 million of SG&amp;amp;A was related to the Intel Acquisitions with $2.2 million related to Intel Corporation's transition services agreement (TSA) charges associated with the Intel Acquisitions. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, research and development (R&amp;amp;D) expenses increased by $9.5 million, or 32%, to $39.5 million from $30.0 million as reported in the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, R&amp;amp;D expenses decreased from 17.7% to 16.5%. In fiscal 2008, approximately $8.1 million of the increase in R&amp;amp;D expenses was related to the Intel Acquisitions with $2.6 million related to Intel TSA charges.  Total operating expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008 decreased by $4.5 million, or 5%, to $83.3 million from $87.8 million as reported in the prior year. Fiscal 2008 operating expenses included $4.8 million of non-recurring Intel TSA charges and an increase of $0.9 million related to stock-based compensation expense. As of September 2008, the Intel TSA expired and no TSA expense will be incurred in fiscal 2009.  For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, our operating loss decreased by $4.1 million, or 7%, to $53.4 million from $57.5 million as reported in the prior year.  Non-operating income recognized during fiscal 2008 includes a gain of $7.4 million from the sale of preferred stock and warrants of WorldWater &amp;amp; Solar Technologies Corporation. Interest income totaled $0.9 million, a decrease of $3.2 million from $4.1 million of interest income reported in the prior year. This reduction was primarily due to lower average cash, cash equivalents and investment balances when compared to the prior year.  Non-operating expenses during fiscal 2008 included a decrease in interest expense of $3.4 million, when compared to the prior year, due to the February 2008 conversion of the Company's convertible subordinated notes to equity. Fiscal 2008 also included a loss totaling $4.7 million related to the conversion of the convertible subordinated notes into equity and $4.3 million in stock-based compensation expense related to the modification of stock options held by terminated employees in December 2007. Further impacts on non-operating expenses included an impairment charge totaling $0.5 million relating to the decline in the market value of the Company's investment in Lightron Corporation, a Korean public company and contract manufacturer, a $1.0 million charge related to the write off of the Company's investment in Velox Corporation, a private company, a $1.1 million charge associated with disposed fixed assets, and $0.7 million in foreign exchange losses associated with the Company's operating activities in Spain, China, and the Netherlands.  The Company's net loss increased by $0.3 million, or 0.5%, to $59.0 million in fiscal 2008 from $58.7 million in fiscal 2007. This represents a reduction in net loss per share of $0.28 from $1.15 net loss per share reported in the prior year to a $0.87 net loss per share for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008.  Fourth Quarter 2008:  For the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2008, consolidated revenue increased by $13.6 million, or 29%, to $60.6 million from $47.0 million as reported in the same period last year.  Quarterly Fiber Optics segment revenue increased by $14.9 million, or 48%, to $46.1 million from $31.2 million as reported in the same period last year. The increase in Fiber Optics revenue was primarily due to the Intel Acquisitions, which added approximately $16.3 million of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008. Fiber Optics revenue represented 76% and 66% of the Company's total consolidated fourth quarter revenue for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Quarterly Photovoltaics revenue decreased by $1.3 million, or 8%, to $14.5 million from $15.8 million as reported in the same period last year. The decrease in U.S. government contract revenue of approximately $5.3 million offset the increase in Photovoltaics revenue from space and terrestrial CPV-related product sales. Photovoltaics revenue represented 24% and 34% of the Company's total consolidated fourth quarter revenue for fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively.  For the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2008, consolidated gross profit decreased by $8.8 million, or 106%, to a negative $0.5 million from $8.3 million as reported in the same period last year. Compared to the prior year, consolidated gross margins for the fourth quarter decreased from 17.4% to a negative 0.8%. On a segment basis, fourth quarter gross margins for Fiber Optics decreased from 17.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 to 8.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 which was primarily due to significant inventory valuation write-downs in the fourth quarter. Our Fiber Optics segment also incurred approximately $5.4 million in expenses related to inventory write-downs and product warranty accruals in fourth quarter fiscal 2008. Fourth quarter gross margins for the Photovoltaics segment decreased from 17.3% as reported in the same period last year to a negative 31.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 due to approximately $6.9 million of inventory write-downs and product warranty accruals associated with our CPV-related business. For the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2008, SG&amp;amp;A expenses decreased by $9.0 million, or 55%, to $7.6 million from $16.6 million as reported in the same period last year. As a percentage of revenue, quarterly SG&amp;amp;A expenses decreased from 35.4% to 12.5%.
