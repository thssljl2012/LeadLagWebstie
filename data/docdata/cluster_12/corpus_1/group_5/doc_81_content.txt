Australian mortgage broker Aussie Home Loans said it has reached agreement with GE Money to acquire GE-owned rival Wizard, which includes its franchise distribution network covering over 160 outlets in city and regional areas around Australia and over 300 mortgage advisors.   As part of the acquisition, Aussie's 33% shareholder, The Commonwealth Bank of Australia, will refinance up to $4 billion worth of Wizard-originated home loans.

The price of the deal, announced by all three companies, was not disclosed.   SOUND OFF!   Send a letter to the Editor, Stuart Papavassiliou at sppapa@monitordaily.com.
