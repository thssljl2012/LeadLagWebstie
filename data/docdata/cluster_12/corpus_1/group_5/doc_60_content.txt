Bank of America plans to sell some of its China Construction Bank shares at a discount to raise up to $3 billion, a Hong Kong newspaper reported on Monday.   Bank of America, which currently owns 44.71 billion H-shares or 19.13 percent of the issued share capital of China Construction Bank, aims to sell some of the Chinese bank shares at more than a 10 percent discount, Apple Daily reported, citing market sources.   The sources said some 6 billion shares would be on offer at a discount of 12 to 17 percent.   Officials at the banks could not be immediately reached for comment.   UBS is the arranger of the deal, the newspaper said but gave no further details.   Shares of China Construction Bank have fallen more than 30 percent so far this year to end at HK$4.59 on Friday.
