The Times   SVG EAGER TO EASE PAYMENTS TO PERMIRA AS CLOUDS GATHER   The private equity investor SVG Capital has requested its parent company, the buyout firm Permira, to renegotiate existing contracts relating to funding given by SVG. SVG is in its own difficulties due to the effect of the credit crunch on raising equity and wants to scale back the amount given to Permira, which is facing concerns about its ability to sell portfolio companies and get a reasonable return for its investors. Last week SVG had commitments of 1.25 billion pounds to its parent, but had only one billion pounds of cash and bank facilities available to meet these commitments.   INEOS ASKS BANKERS TO WAIVE COVENANTS.   The chemical company Ineos has been hit hard by an abrupt decline in demand for plastics, and is now asking its creditors for a revision of the terms of its loans. The company has requested a waiver of two covenants worth seven billion euros that it made with a banking syndicate led by Barclays and Merrill Lynch. Ineos has been caught unawares by the global economic downturn and reports that shipments to customers are at between a third and a quarter of their normal levels. 'We have seen something unprecedented', stated the company's chief executive Tom Crotty. 'Our customers are closing their plant or destocking'. FORMER EXECUTIVES OF MG ROVER STALL PUBLICATION OF REPORT   Four former directors of the defunct British carmaker MG Rover have held up the independent inquiry into their conduct by claiming that the Department for Trade and Industry (now the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform) did not assist the company enough as it failed. The 'Phoenix Four' were initially welcomed when they took over the business from BMW in 2000, but quickly caused fury by awarding themselves a total of up to 42 million pounds in pay and pensions (whilst the workers' pension fund sank further into debt). The report was meant to be published some months ago, but the former directors' claims had resulted in a need for investigators to interview a number of fresh witnesses.
