ANZ Bank shares have slumped after the bank said it has a credit exposure to child-care provider ABC Learning Centres of about $182 million.  The bank's shareswere recently down $1.98, or 10%, for the day, at $17.02.  ANZ made the disclosure after ABC Learning today went into voluntary administration and its bankers subsequently appointed receivers and managers.  'ABC Learning Centres group was treated as a non-performing loan and an individual provision taken as part of ANZ's 2008 results,'' the bank said.  'ANZ will make further adjustments to provisions as required.''  ANZ also confirmed its exposure to Allco Finance Group was insignificant.
