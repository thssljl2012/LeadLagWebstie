 First, it didnt raise capital decisively early in the year. Back in the spring, Barclays was seen as in a totally different league from the likes of its UK peers, Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS. It would have been able to reinforce its balance sheet from a position of strength. But the bank was in denial. It insisted until it was blue in the face that it didnt need capital. By the time it started its capital-raising Odyssey in the summer, the weather had already turned stormy.   Second, Barclays turned its back on a UK government rescue last month only to pay through the nose for capital from Abu Dhabi and Qatar. The board convinced itself that taking the taxpayers shilling would amount to heavy-handed nationalisation. As more details of the UK rescue scheme have emerged, the scaremongering looks exaggerated. The argument also ignores the risk that the two Middle Eastern sheikhs might themselves want to meddle. They will, after all, end up with over 30pc of the banks shares roughly double what the UK government would have owned.   The decision might have been finely balanced were it not for the high cost of this capital raising. Barclays is sticking to the line that it is only costing it 30m a year more than raising the money from the UK state. But this is a spurious figure based on only partial analysis. The total hit suffered by shareholders is more like 2bn, according to a breakingviews analysis.   People, and institutions, find it extremely hard to say sorry. Barclays is no exception. It insists that it did not make any misjudgments. Maintaining such an attitude could lead to an increasing loss of support from its non-Arab shareholders. By contrast, if Barclays was more humble, it could start to repair relations with investors. It might then even find that they were willing to back it in an alternative, less expensive capital injection.
