Brent Horst, Home Hardware's Director of Corporate Applications shared, 'Our Dealer-owners are the core of our business and we're constantly looking for ways to improve the quality and timeliness of the services we provide them. The lion's share of our information exchange with partners is through electronic file transfer and we saw a number of opportunities to improve our service levels by enhancing our capabilities in that area.' After a thorough evaluation process, Home Hardware chose MessageWay. 'We found that many of the other solutions we looked at required us to change the way we do business,' said Horst. 'MessageWay gave us much more flexibility to address the file exchange requirements for our retailer network without having to change our business processes. As an added benefit, we also see more opportunities to extend MessageWay into our supplier community.' Greg Faubert, MessageWay President and CEO noted, 'Home Hardware was very disciplined and methodical in their evaluation, and they had a well-defined vision of how a managed file transfer solution should fit into their business model. That played right into MessageWay's strengths. Our service-oriented architecture enabled them to adapt the solution to match their business environment and processes, not the other way around.'
