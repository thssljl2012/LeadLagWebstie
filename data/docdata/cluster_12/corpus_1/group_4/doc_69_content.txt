The merger of Westpac and St George is heading towards the finish line, with the Federal Court of Australia rubber-stamping the arrangement yesterday.  The deal sees St George shareholders receive 1.31 Westpac shares for every St George share they own, as well as a final dividend and special dividend totalling $A1.25 per share.  The new Westpac shares issued as part of the merger will commence trading on a deferred settlement basis today and on a normal settlement basis on December 2.  St George chief executive Paul Fegan has resigned rather than work under Westpac boss Gail Kelly, walking away with a $A4 million payout after only being in the top job for 12 months.  Further senior management departures are expected once the merger is complete.  Earlier this month, St George shareholders voted overwhelmingly in favour of the merger, with around 95% of the votes cast at a special meeting showing approval of the deal.  The $A17 billion merger attained Federal Treasury approval in late October, and a green light from the Australian Competition and Commerce Commission before that.  Australias federal treasurer, Wayne Swan, has imposed some tough conditions: Westpac will have to maintain the existing number of Westpac and St George branches and ATMs, including those in non-urban areas.  It must also keep all Westpac and St George retail banking brands, including Bank SA, maintain dedicated management teams for St George and Westpac retail banking distribution, and retain a corporate presence in the southern Sydney suburb of Kogarah.  The conditions will also require the removal of foreign ATM fees for Westpac customers using St George ATMs and vice-versa.  Together Westpac and St George would have over 1200 branches and 2700 ATMs in Australia, and 10 million customers.  The combined entity would become Australias largest financial services company, leapfrogging market leader Commonwealth Bank.
