FROM cradle to grave in four years. Rubicon is the textbook case on how to make connections, make a killing and get away with it.  The Rubicon model: exploit big contacts to establish an asset management company, float three externally managed trusts, attract some friendly press, use equity to raise debt, use both to go on a property spending spree, devise a baffling array of special vehicles, rip out as many fees as possible and often and large as possible, hold critical unit-holder meetings at Christmas, keep share prices up with share buybacks, sell down personal trust holdings, then flog it to Allco using board connections before the market tanks.  Thanks to the Allco deal, the men behind Rubicon pulled out $64 million in cash. They may have already snipped another $50 million to $150 million in fees.  National Australia Bank appointed receivers to Rubicon Holdings on Friday. Rubicon Holdings owns Rubicon Asset Management, which manages the three listed disgraces  Rubicon Europe, Rubicon America and Rubicon Japan.  NAB has a $20 million exposure to Rubicon Holdings and $170 million in loans to the three listed trusts.  Rubicon founder Gordon Fell was late hopping on the financial engineering bandwagon but did not waste a second once aboard.  Together, the three trusts accumulated assets worth more than $5 billion in two years. At their peak, their combined market value was $1.2 billion. For the year to June 2007, Rubicon Asset Management, the private entity owned by Fell, Coe and Matthew Cooper, gouged $120 million in fees.  The trusts were spruiked to the market as a safe investment in property boasting a high yield. Such was the sophisticated structuring and presentation, concocted by Fell and Cooper, that retail investors were easily duped.  The gearing levels were too high and the portfolios slapped together to exploit bull market conditions.  Rubicon America was the first, listing in 2005. Its ASX moniker, RAT, was apt. Rubicon Europe came next and Rubicon Japan in October 2006.  In each case, the underlying properties were impressively leased on a long-term basis and borrowings were similarly arranged long term, and at fixed rates, and hedged into Australian dollars.  In December 2006, however, RAT and REU acquired large mezzanine loan portfolios. Each was financed substantially from borrowings.  This was a material change to the business. They went from supposedly offering safe yields, to punts on somebody else's real estate debts.
