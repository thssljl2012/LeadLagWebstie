Skilled young people worldwide will benefit from a 5million (about Shs15billion) new global investment partnership between Barclays and UNICEF.  The partnership, dubbed Building Young Futures, will focus on providing young people with access to education, vocational training, employment and supporting opportunities for entrepreneurship. The young people will attain skills in entrepreneurial development, leadership, small business management and book keeping among others.  In a communication issued to Daily Monitor on Wednesday, Mr Marcus Agius, chairman of Barclays said, despite the difficult current economic conditions, it  is vital that  business continues to  invest in sustainability.  Mr Agius said helping to develop and empower individuals and  communities was vitally important in a move to stimulate global  economic growth. He said Barclays, aligning its community  investment  programmes to  their core business, maximises  great  impact; delivers social benefits on the ground, and  develop  future  markets for its business.  Mr David Bull, executive director of UNICEF UK, said individual projects will seek to raise the educational attainment of disadvantaged children, and increase the number of young people gaining  employment or starting their own  business by providing  them with the necessary skills and opportunities via mentoring, microfinance and financial training.  The partnership involves an unprecedented degree of collaboration between UNICEF UK and a corporate  partner on the design and  delivery of a global initiative.  Apart from the 5million investment fund, Barclays will provide business and financial expertise throughout the three-year project. The partnership forms part of Barclays wider five-year, $150m flagship community investment programme.
