We would like to stress that a previous headline for this article, which implied that Ms Staveley had been declared bankrupt, was factually incorrect and apologise for any distress caused.  Glamourous City figure Amanda Staveley, whose company is in line for a bumper 40m payout for helping line up a 7bn cash injection into Barclays, was brought close to bankruptcy - by the very bank she has now helped to refinance.  Staveley, 35, pictured at a football match in Liverpool, is a partner in PCP Gulf Partners. It advised Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al Nahyan this week on investing 3.5bn in Barclays - a move that will give the sheikh a 16% stake in the bank.  But only four years ago, Staveley, a former girlfriend of Prince Andrew, was being sued by Barclays for more than 1m.  She had personally guaranteed a loan for a business she ran, but the operation ran into trouble.  Staveley was targeted with a bankruptcy petition, but eventually struck an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) with Barclays and other creditors.  An IVA gives someone who owes money a breathing space to pay off some or all of their debts.  Staveley has emerged as a key adviser to Sheikh Mansour and the Abu Dhabi royal family.  She played a pivotal role in lining up the takeover of Manchester City Football Club by Sheikh Mansour.
