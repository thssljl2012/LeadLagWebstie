 (Marketwire Via Acquire Media NewsEdge) TROY, MI, November 10 / MARKET WIRE/ --   North American Bancard (NAB), a 'Top 35' bank card acquirer (Source: Nilson Report, March 2008) today announced the creation  of a new company division dedicated to serving the electronic payments  processing needs of organizations and downstream clients requiring a  merchant services segment specialist. The company's Alliance Division will  develop and manage channel relationships with value-added resellers,  software developers, ASPs, financial institutions, specialty merchants, and  others desiring integrated payment solutions paired with meaningful and  ongoing merchant account management services. 'Our Alliance Division has been formed in response to the growing presence  of POS, order-entry, billing and enterprise management solutions fitted  with payment applications,' said Marc Gardner, Founder &amp;amp; CEO of North American Bancard. 'Integrated solutions are here to enhance productivity  and profits -- but bringing it all home requires a tuned-in and responsive  payments partner. We're moving to fill the 'issues-ownership' gap so often  the by-product of third-party technology intermediations, a deficiency not  addressed by the majority of competitors in our service space.' Leading the new division is David L. Tepoorten, a payments industry veteran  with 24 years' experience in merchant portfolio, ISO and Acquirer bank management. 'North American Bancard has the ideal engine in place to rescue  under-serviced merchants in a layered technology marketplace. The payments  landscape is populated with many moving parts. Our team is fully conversant  in the features and functionality of NAB's multi-platform payments product  suite, and adept at managing the various relationship components intrinsic  to electronic payments processing.' NAB's Alliance Division will also provide sales channel support via  integration and/or processor certification assistance to its partners,  working with them to market their payments-enabled applications to targeted clients. 'We're in the business of helping our customers outperform their        competition,' said Tepoorten. 'By extension, we show our customers and  partners how one can effectively utilize payment options and delivery  mechanisms to grow revenues, achieve automation gains, reduce operating  expenses and achieve compliance with the rules governing bank card  acceptance -- the primary driver behind every merchant's bank card acceptance costs.'
