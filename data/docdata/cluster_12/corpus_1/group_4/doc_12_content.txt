TOKYO, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Three more companies on Monday started providing price data on U.N. carbon offsets to the state-backed Japan Bank for International Cooperation, bolstering the bank's role as a supplier of such information in Japan.   The three are Barclays Capital Japan, orbeo/Rhodia Japan and Sumitomo Corp, JBIC said in a statement.   The Japanese government and big companies, including utilities, have been active in buying offsets to help the world's fifth-biggest polluter meet its greenhouse gas emissions reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol.   But most of the transactions have been made over the counter, and there is little price data available.   JBIC, which extends yen loans to developing nations and helps fund international energy projects involving Japanese companies, last year launched an Internet-based noticeboard to help buyers and sellers exchange information about such offsets.   The offsets, called Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs), are based on U.N.-led clean energy projects in developing countries.   Japanese companies can use CERs to help them meet voluntary emissions reduction targets.   Since April, JBIC in a joint venture with Nikkei Digital Media has updated indication prices for issued CERs weekly with help from five CER buyers -- Eco Securities, Fortis, JPMorgan, Natsource Japan and Marubeni Corp.   As of Monday, the bid price was 1,919.0 yen ($19) per tonne for CERs in spot delivery of 50,000 tonnes in carbon dioxide equivalent, having almost halved since a peak in July.   JBIC on Friday launched a similar online noticeboard for clean energy and industrial gas projects abroad, aiming to boost early stage investment in projects in developing countries that would generate CERs.   More than 150 companies have access to JBIC's secondary market platform, including Japan's top banks and utility firms. About 20 firms abroad have in the past year obtained membership to take part in CER trading, JBIC has said.   The amount of offsets traded via the website is not known as participants are not required to report to JBIC.
