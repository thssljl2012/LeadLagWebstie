 National Australia Bank (NAB) has launched an institutional placement of shares to raise approximately A$2.0 billion to strengthen its balance sheet and take advantage of organic growth opportunities. The placement has been fully underwritten by Goldman Sachs JBWere, Merrill Lynch and UBS AG, Australia Branch.  This initiative is consistent with NABs previously announced intention to raise capital equivalent to its next two Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) shortfalls.  More favourable market conditions have enabled NAB to accelerate its capital management plans and accordingly, upon successful completion of the placement, NAB will no longer proceed with its underwrite of the DRP for the 2008 final dividend.  Following the placement, NAB will also offer retail shareholders the opportunity to participate in a non-underwritten share purchase plan (SPP) at the institutional placement price. The  SPP will provide eligible ordinary shareholders on the register at 5.00pm on 13 November 2008 with the opportunity, without incurring brokerage or other transaction costs, to  subscribe for up to A$10,000 worth of NAB ordinary shares (subject to obtaining expected relief from ASIC) . However, NAB will reserve the right to scale back applications under the  SPP if total demand exceeds $250m. Further details of the SPP will be provided to eligible shareholders in due course.  The capital raising will result in NAB moving immediately to a Tier 1 ratio of approximately 8.0%.
