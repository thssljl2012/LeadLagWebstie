St George Bank Ltd chief executive Paul Fegan has resigned, after the bank's merger with Westpac Banking Group was approved by shareholders last week.  Mr Fegan, who was expected to resign, will leave with a termination payout of about $2 million.  He will also receive payment for any amounts in respect of accrued salary, leave and other entitlements. 'Given that St George shareholders have overwhelmingly endorsed the merger, it's now appropriate to make my decision about the future,' Mr Fegan said on Monday in a statement. 'I am very proud that I leave the bank in a very good position, particularly given the challenges the sector has faced around the world.' St George's merger with Westpac got the green light from the Federal Court on Monday.  Trading in St George shares on the Australian stock exchange will be suspended from the close of trading on Monday.  Mr Fegan had been chief executive since February this year after former boss Gail Kelly left to become head of Westpac.  He joined St George in 2002.  Mrs Kelly wished Mr Fegan well. 'I would particularly like to thank him for his strong leadership of St George over this challenging 2008 year and for his assistance in ensuring the merger gets off to a good start,' she said. 'I wish Paul and his family every success for the future.'  2008 AAP Brought to you by
