Key Accomplishments/Items During the Quarter  Global Hotline, Inc. successfully renewed or extended two contracts with existing customers during the three months ended September 30, 2008. Global Hotline, Inc. announced its intention to pay down the majority of its outstanding debt at the rate of $4 million per year over the next three years. They have $9 million of debt maturing during the next year and expect to repay $4 million and refinance the remaining $5 million.        Global Hotline, Inc. was impacted by the severe financial difficulties experienced by its largest insurance client, AIG, and a slight reduction in the telecommunication sector. Global Hotline has taken the following actions to secure the return to profitability:  1. Repositioned capacity to a second major insurance customer and to its rapidly growing credit card business.        2. Global Hotline, Inc. has commenced work for a new client, a major European insurance company.  3. Management has acted quickly to implement operating expense reductions, including a scaling back in new hires.  The company's CEO, Derek Schneideman, said, 'At a macro level, the deepening world-wide financial crisis is impacting the Company's revenue and profit projections. Therefore, the Company has revised its annual revenue guidance to $64 million, an increase of $25.3 million or 65% over the prior year. The combination of the measures we implemented in late in the September 30, 2008 quarter, at both subsidiary and corporate levels are expected to be reflected in a return to profitability in Q4 for Global Hotline, Inc., if not the entire Company. Looking to the future for FY2009/10, we expect to generate approximately $1.8 million at the corporate level from dividends from our equity investments, profits from Global Hotline Philippines, Inc. and from management service agreements from our subsidiaries.' 'We are meeting the challenges of this, almost unprecedented, economic downturn with a thorough restructuring of all our operational costs, and a greater emphasis on those business operations most likely to produce revenue, cash, and profits. We expect to make some use of our shelf registration statement to raise new capital to sustain and, where prudent, to expand operations of our Business Process Outsourcing ('BPO') business units. To date, the shelf registration statement has not been utilized. We remain dedicated to the transformation of IA Global from our current structure into a Services focused corporation comprising 3 business divisions, i.e. BPO, Financial Services and, in the future, B2B Services. To reinforce this ongoing change in the Company's business model and to create greater brand equity management is evaluating the merits of changing the Company's name and its stock symbol. Additionally, in order to achieve our mid-term ambitions the company will divide itself into two functional business divisions, BPO (including Human Capital Services) and Financial Services. The Financial Services Division will be lead by an experienced financial services executive. An announcement regarding this new position will be made shortly. The end goal of the Financial Services Division will be to build an independent business entity that, at a future point, can be spun-off from the Company by way of a public listing or a private sale.' 'At the business unit level we are disappointed by the sudden drop in Global Hotline, Inc.'s Q2 revenues caused by the near collapse of AIG and its effect on the insurance industry as a whole. Aggressive action has been taken to rectify any negative impact on Global Hotline, Inc.'s forecasted results. To this end we have revised our sales projections by eliminating any forecasts of new large Q4 orders such as have occurred in most prior years. On a positive note, Global Hotline Philippines is experiencing a growing demand for its outsourced services as companies, worldwide, seek to reduce both their cost of goods sold and operational expenses. Our minority investment in Taicom Securities, has grown more slowly than anticipated due to the adverse economic climate, however, Taicom has recently started to increase in pace and we are confident that this business will add significant value to the Company in the coming fiscal year. The combination of the actions we have taken, and those actions we will take in the future, are aimed exclusively at protecting and enhancing shareholder value and to ensuring the Company as a whole is well positioned for a turnaround in market conditions.' 'In support of the Company's cost reduction activities commencing on December 1, 2008, I will no longer accept any bonus payments that may be due under my compensation package. I will continue this policy until we have seen an improvement in our stock price and the Board of Directors feels that the Company is tracking to its mid-term business goals,' the company's CEO, Derek Schneideman stated further.
