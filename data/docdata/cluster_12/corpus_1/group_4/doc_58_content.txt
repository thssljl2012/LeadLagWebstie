The order includes four superjumbo A380s, 10 of the long-range A350-900s, five wide-bodied A330-200s and 42 single-aisle planes from the A320 family.  Airbus did not give a value for the deal. The official list price for the 61 jets amounts to $US8.99 billion ($A13.56 billion) but airlines usually negotiate discounts to the catalogue price.  The order is good news for the European planemaker, whose parent company is EADS, at a tough time for the industry. Airbus' customer airlines are battling volatile fuel prices, tighter credit conditions and diminishing passenger traffic amid the global economic slowdown.  The International Air Transport Association is forecasting airline losses may exceed $US5.2 billion ($A7.85 billion) this year.  Although the recent nosedive in oil prices has brought some relief to airlines, allowing them to start reducing ticket prices, analysts warn that balance sheets are worrying.  Grupo Marsans said the 61 jets it ordered will be operated by subsidiary or related airlines. President Gonzalo Pascual said in a statement they are intended to 'enhance our position on the short- and long-haul sector' in the mid to longterm.
