St George Bank shareholders have approved Westpac Banking Corp's $16 billion merger proposal.  St George chairman John Curtis said after the bank's extraordinary meeting today to approve the merger, that there had been a strong vote in favour of the mostly scrip deal.  'Over 94% was a very strong endorsement, ' Mr Curtis told journalists. 'I think the benefits of this deal were obviously very clear to our shareholders.  A count of votes cast by St George shareholders had 282.12 million shares, or 94.55% in favour of the merger, with 16.28 million, or 5.45% against.  The deal needed 75% of the total votes cast to be in favour of the merger for it to be approved.  Curtis said it was a combination of reasons that convinced shareholders of St George, Australia's fifth largest lender, to merge with Westpac, the country's second biggest bank by market value.  'Creating a bigger, stronger bank between two very well run banks, in this climate today made a lot of sense,' Curtis said.  'Secondly, the business model, which Westpac proposed to us - it was a model that was all about retaining the St George culture, retaining the brands, the branches, the ATM network - that was something that we found very compelling.  'And then the premium for St George shareholders - 1.31 Westpac shares was 28.5% above the spot price at the time.'  The Finance Sector Union (FSU) has estimated that as many as 5000 jobs could be at risk due to the merger.  Curtis told journalists that the number was pure speculation although in his presentation earlier to shareholders warned there may be job losses.  'Yes, unfortunately there may well be some job losses, mainly in the back office and head office functions, which are inevitable with any merger,' Curtis said.  'But Westpac have given a commitment to minimise job losses through natural attrition and redeployment wherever possible.  'However, whilst the board understands that there will be some inevitable short-term pain, the acceptance of the Westpac proposal is all about trying to create a stronger and even better bank for customers, staff and shareholders over the ensuing years, particularly having regard to the current uncertain economic outlook.'  Westpac is offering 1.31 of its shares for every St George share and a special dividend payment.  Curtis said St George had performed well in its fiscal 2008 year and had 'punched above its weight'.  He said that all banks were facing difficult and turbulent financial times.  'Despite the recent action taken by the Australian government, our financial services sector is expected to continue facing a number of challenges in the coming year,' Curtis said.  'These include softening growth across the broader Australian economy, slower growth in lending products and an increase in credit defaults.  'In this environment, the earnings growth for all banks, including St George, is expected to slow.'  St George shareholders will receive their new Westpac shares on December 1.  -AAP  Building a new shop? Want to do a mystery shopping survey?
