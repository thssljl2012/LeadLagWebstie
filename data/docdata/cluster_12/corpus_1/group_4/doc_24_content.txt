The Crown is set to reap a $1 billion cash dividend from the wholesale funding guarantee scheme as banks have to pay upfront to receive government backing.  And if financial markets don't normalise, said Treasury special adviser Michael Reddell, and the scheme is extended beyond the two-year window, the Government could receive as much as $5b. The cash would be amortised over the life of each wholesale bond issue, rather than appearing as a ''misleading cash windfall'' in the Crown accounts, he said.  ''We wouldn't want governments thinking they can spend that.''  Reddell also revealed that, in the improbable circumstance of one of the major commercial banks defaulting on an issue, the Government would enjoy no special creditor privileges.  ''Let's say it was $10b,'' he said. ''We'd pay that $10b and put ourselves in a position as creditors and claim back from the assets of the bank when those assets are liquidated.''  It would be unfair to other creditors to put itself ahead in the queue. ''We'd be a standard unsecured creditor,'' he said. The chance of default is considered extremely remote.  The Reserve Bank has priced the guarantee at a level low enough that it will be used when needed but high enough to encourage banks to graduate to non-guaranteed funding when conditions allow.  The big four _ ANZ National, Westpac, BNZ and ASB _ will be charged 0.85% on terms less than one year and 1.4% for anything longer.  Predicting revenue generated by the guarantee was difficult as it was unclear how long the credit crisis would last and, given the fiscal deterrents, how many banks would take up the guarantee offer.  David Tripe, head of banking studies at Massey University, said ''Many of the Australian-owned banks may choose to access funding through the parent company as it will be charged less by the Reserve Bank of Australia.''  Reddell said: ''The revenue from the scheme will depend largely on how much it is used and for how long. ''If markets normalise quite rapidly the revenue will be limited. That would be a highly desirable outcome.  ''More likely, the scheme will be used for some time. If, simply as an example, $40b of paper is guaranteed, revenue would be around $400 million per annum.''  If, however, it underwrote only $10b on three-month paper, ''we'd only get $20m of revenue'', he said. For $50b at two years and another $50b at five years would see the scheme generate about $5b revenue, which Reddell reiterated would be amortised rather than treated as a cash windfall.  ''The money is, in effect, an insurance policy. It needs to be used to pay down debt now in effect, kept against the possibility of claims being made on the guarantee.''  After all, as an unsecured creditor, there is no guarantee the Crown will get all its money back in the event of a default.  Total bank wholesale liability stands at around $150b but some of the paper does not mature until 2011, so only a portion will need to be refinanced during the next two years.  At ANZ National, for instance, $4.6b is maturing this year; another $7.1b is due for rollover next year; $2.6b falls due in 2011.  Much depends on what happens in international markets. The full unwinding of Lehman Brothers or the fate of large hedge funds (the subject of much speculation) could send markets into another spin.  The prospect of another shock, Reddell said, fell into the ''Rumsfeldian known unknowns and unknown unknowns'' category.  Next Story: Milk powder reflects fall in commodities
