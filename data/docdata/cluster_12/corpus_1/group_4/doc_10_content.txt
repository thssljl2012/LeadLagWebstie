ANZ offering online direct access to shares  Works like an online bank account  An initial deposit of $1000 is required  OCCASIONALLY a new investment product arrives that changes the whole market.  ING's online savings maximiser was one, switching Australians on to the idea of a simple internet account that paid a high rate of interest.  Now ANZ may well have given birth to another - the modestly titled online investment account.  Like the ING product, this one is incredibly simple but powerful.  The idea is to give anyone with an ANZ bank account direct access to the share market without going through a broker or having to worry about selecting individual shares.  It works in exactly the same way as an online bank account except that the balance will fluctuate directly in line with the performance of the ASX 200 index.  Dividends are paid twice yearly and fees are very low and compare favourably to brokerage, particularly for regular, small investments.  From an investment point of view, the product gives even the very smallest investor access to at least four very attractive features:  * The ability to use dollar cost averaging to enhance returns by buying a set amount of shares every week, month or year.  *The ability to automate the investment process, by setting up periodic withdrawals.  *The simplicity of a single online account that will hold all tax return records.  *Buying an index of the top 200 Australian companies, taking the stress out of selecting individual stocks.  ANZ's MD of investment and insurance products, Geoff Cohen, said the product was born out of research showing that many Australians were keen to invest in the growth of the share market.  What stops them - apart from the sort of bear market we are in now - is a lack of time, a fear of mistakes, a lack of knowledge and the cost of investing.  'We set out to meet all of their concerns in one product that operated just like an online bank account,'' said Mr Cohen.  'I can assure you there is a lot of hard work involved in making something that is so simple to use.  'But our tests on focus groups make us confident that this product will fill a lot of different investment needs.''  The account works on a $1000 initial deposit with minimum extra investments of $100.  The balance of the account will go up and down with the share market with entry and exit fees of just 25 basis points (25 for every $100) and management fees of 1 per cent a year.  To use the current market as a guide of how dollar cost averaging would work with the account, imagine you are investing $100 every month.  Near the end of the bull market last year, you would have bought roughly half as much of the ASX 200 index as you would be getting now.  So you are buying much more when shares are 'on sale'' and fewer when they are expensive, which can greatly improve total returns even in a bear market.
