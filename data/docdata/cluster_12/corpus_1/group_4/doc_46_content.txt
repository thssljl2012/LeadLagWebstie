Norwegian shipping company Odfjell SE (OSE:ODF) said on Thursday (6 November) that it has signed a ship sale and lease-back agreement with nabCapital, a division of National Australia Bank Limited.   The agreement covers the sale of the 2005-built 40,000 dwt tanker Bow Sky and the lease-back of the vessel on an 11-year charter.   The transaction results in a net gain of USD32m and is part of Odfjell's measures to strengthen its equity position following the Norwegian retroactive tax imposed last year.   Odfjell, headquartered in Bergen, Norway, is a leading provider of bulk liquids transport and logistics services, with a fleet of some 115 parcel tankers and tank terminal operations in Europe, the US and Asia. The company reported a turnover of over USD1bn in 2007.   One British pound (GBP) is worth approximately 1.60 US dollars (USD).
