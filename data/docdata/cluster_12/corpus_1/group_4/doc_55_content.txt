All of the senior investment banking team and equity research team of the former Lehman Brothers' Israel operation have also joined Barclays Capital. The team, under Len Rosen, will report to John Winter, head of investment banking for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) at Barclays Capital. Mr Winter said: 'Barclays Capital is delighted to further extend its strong franchise into Israel. We are proud to play a central role in the continuing development of the country's economy and to be an integral part of Israel's financial markets. The addition of the former Lehman Brothers team, which has for many years been the pre-eminent investment banking operation in Israel, brings a whole new range of capabilities and opportunities to our team and clients, both in Israel and around the world, adding to our existing strength and global reach.'  Barclays Capital, the investment banking division of Barclays, has expanded its European, Middle East and Africa investment banking franchise into Israel, with the takeover of Lehman Brothers' Israel operation. The bank has appointed Leonard Rosen, formerly CEO of Lehman Brothers for Israel, as CEO of Israel at Barclays Capital.
