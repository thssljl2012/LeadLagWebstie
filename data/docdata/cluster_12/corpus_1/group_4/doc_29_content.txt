AMP NZ Office Trust has renewed 50% of its bank debt facility early with its 2 existing banks.  Chief executive Rob Lang said all of the trusts $485 million bank debt had been due to expire in October 2009. However, the trust sought a new arrangement ahead of time, negotiating a new 3-year term with the Bank of New Zealand &amp;amp; Westpac for $242.5 million of the facility, with the remainder to be addressed before October 2009.  Mr Lang said: This provides financial security for the trust to continue to grow, while also helping to manage &amp;amp; reduce risk to earnings. The facility renewal &amp;amp; the outcomes achieved demonstrate the trusts ability to access credit in challenging &amp;amp; difficult credit market conditions. Other banks had also shown keen interest.  The new blended interest rate for the total bank facility is 7.87% (including margins), up slightly from 7.56%.  The trusts bank gearing (bank debt:total assets) at 30 September was 26.3%, well below its self-imposed ceiling of 40%. 84.7% was hedged through interest-rate swaps for an average of more than 5 years. The swap portfolio isnt exposed to any swap maturities or unhedged swap maturities in the next 12 months, and no more than 25% of the trusts debt cover matures in any 12-month period for the next 4 years.  AMP NZ Office Trust, New Zealands largest listed investor in prime commercial office property, is managed by AMP Haumi Management Ltd.  Want to comment? Email bobdey@propbd.co.nz.
