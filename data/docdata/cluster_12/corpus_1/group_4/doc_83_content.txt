 after 'overwhelming' demand for shares Article from: AAP Font size:    article:   article:  November 10, 2008 01:17pm NAB will place shares with institutions at $20 each, after its offer was oversubscribed following "overwhelming" demand, the head of the bank's n operations Ahmed Fahour said.  NAB announced the $2 billion share placement to institutions and sophisticated investors earlier today.  It took just one hour to build the book from the fixed price offer of $20 per share, said Mr Fahour.  The pricing is equivalent to a 9.7 per cent discount to NAB's closing share price on Friday of $22.15.  The books closed at 12.30pm (AEDT) after NAB received a very strong response to the placement, which would allow the bank to pursue organic growth opportunities, Mr Fahour said. "Our capital raising plan was based around underwriting the shortfalls in our dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) for the final fiscal 2008 dividend and the first half for fiscal 2009 dividend," NAB deputy chief executive Michael Ullmer said. "If at any time there was the opportunity to raise an equivalent amount of capital or more through a share placement we would do that, providing the discount required was modest and we were able to achieve equity between shareholders," he said. "So the price we went to the market today was a fixed price of $20 (a share), which is a 9.7 per cent discount." This discount is much lower than that applied to other share placements around the world, he Mr Ullmer said. "It's a lower discount that we've seen in our local market with a number of financial institutions in recent times."
