Today's experts are Amanda Davidson of London-based financial adviser Baigrie Davies; Melanie Bien of mortgage broker Savills Private Finance; and Andrew Elson at the Leeds office of financial adviser Bates Investment Services.  M. G. writes: I have contributed to the State pension scheme as an employee for 38 years. As the rules are due to change so that anyone retiring after 2010 must have paid National Insurance for only 30 years rather than the present 44 years for men to receive the full State pension, can I stop my NI contributions now?  A. E. replies: I'm afraid not. It may be frustrating for those over 46 who have paid NI all their working lives to learn that, though they qualify already, they must carry on. But this is because NI contributions are used to fund not only pensions, but other payments such as unemployment, sickness and bereavement benefits.  Balance: A diverse portfolio creates stability in a volatile market  B. H. writes: A number of my Isas have fallen sharply in value. Among the worst performers are JPMorgan Natural Resources, Invesco Perpetual Latin America and Neptune Russia and Greater Russia funds. Of the 14 funds I have invested in through equity Isas, I am already down more than 10,000. What should I do?  A. D. replies: The funds you mention are very volatile, which means they are likely to have been affected more than others by the fallout from the worldwide credit crunch.  Given that markets tend to recover in the long term - though when is not certain - you would be well advised to stay with the funds.  However, you might want to consider the balance of your portfolio. When choosing funds it is best to start with a structure rather than merely buying a fund that looks attractive or is a current 'best buy'.  Your structure, or asset allocation, is determined by the amount of risk you are prepared to take. Any well-balanced portfolio will have some more risky and some less risky investments.  That way when markets take a tumble not all investments are so badly hit and in some downturns certain types of investment can even prosper. That makes your portfolio more resilient to a downturn.  Best of both worlds?  L. L. writes: My mortgage deal is coming to an end and I cannot decide whether to take out a fixed-rate deal or a tracker mortgage. I have heard that drop-lock mortgages offer the best of both worlds. Is this right?  M. B. replies: A drop-lock mortgage allows you to start with a tracker to benefit from reductions in the base rate.  But if rates start to rise you can lock into a fixed rate without facing a penalty. Often there is no new arrangement fee either. However, the tracker rates are unlikely to be as competitive as normal trackers.  Barclays, Nationwide and Lloyds TSB-owned Cheltenham &amp;amp; Gloucester offer such mortgages.
