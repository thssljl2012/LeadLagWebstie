Try Youth and Community Services chief executive Damien Mowlam says the group has spoken with the administrators and receivers of ABC Learning and the federal government in a bid to purchase or manage via corporate partnerships between 20 to 40 centres in Melbourne and eastern Victoria. 'We've been in contact with ABC prior to (last week's) announcement and were told that they weren't selling any centres in Australia or New Zealand, and then we've been in contact with the receivers and they've said they haven't made a decision yet which way it'll go, in terms of if they're going to sell or carry on as normal.' With access to capital, Mr Mowlam said the organisation was well placed to finance the purchase. 'We're probably one of the not-for-profits that has got some capital and access to more capital so... we do think there might be a limit on how many not-for-profits can put their hand up and have got the capacity to manage the centres.' Try Youth and Community Services has not ruled out bids to take over centres interstate, Mr Mowlam said. 'Our preference right now is Victoria, but we also feel that there's probably a lack of quality not-for-profits in some of the smaller states,' he said. 'So we certainly would look at assisting communities in Tasmania or South Australia where there's not a whole lot of not-for-profit providers. 'As a community-based organisation we'd be very concerned to see the centres shut because they're such a vital part of society, so we're hoping to work with the government to ensure that at least a large majority of them stay open.'
