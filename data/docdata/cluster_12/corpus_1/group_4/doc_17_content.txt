This year's RSA Conference theme is built around Alan Turing - the British cryptographer, mathematician, logician, philosopher and biologist - and will celebrate his legacy and contribution towards digital computers today. Experts and historians agree that Turing had a deeper understanding of the vast potential of computer science than anyone in his era, and is often considered the father of modern computer science.
