AUSTRALIA'S largest bank worth $48 billion, formed by the approved merger of Westpac and St George banks, will start trading next Tuesday.  Fiery opposition by retail shareholders and staff at today's meeting on Westpac's merger with BankSA parent St George Bank failed to prevent an overwhelming vote in favour of the marriage.  The merged Westpac and St George bank overtakes Australia's largest bank, the Commonwealth by more than $2 billion on current trading values (13:15 AEST).  Most of the bank's 150,000 retail investors approved the merger with 89 per cent voting in favour and 9.8 per cent against - giving the deal its required 75 per cent majority.  Strong institutional support saw almost 95 per cent of proxies in favour of St George Bank's $14 billion takeover with its big four rival Westpac and only 5 per cent against.  St George Bank shares are expected to be delisted from the Australian Securities Exchange on Monday, pending court approval of its scheme of arrangement.  New Westpac shares begin trading on Tuesday, November 18, combining Australia's third and fifth largest banks combined to become Australia's biggest bank.  Chairman John Curtis told a packed Sydney Convention Centre that the transaction - based on a 1-for-1.31 share swap in favour of St George's shareholders - has remained largely undisturbed over the past seven months despite the upheaval in world financial markets.  Westpac has had a straight run at St George as the liquidity turmoil put paid to any competing bid from both National Australia Bank and ANZ, its two most likely domestic competitors, or a large overseas institution.  And that was despite the Dragon keeping the door open for a higher offer, having stated all along that its unanimous recommendation was subject to no superior bid emerging.  St George confirmed today it did not receive another approach to even consider knocking Westpac out of the way.  Support for the deal has also grown in recent weeks after the sweetening of the original terms under which Westpac agreed to allow St George to declare a one-off special dividend of 31c a share - equivalent to the entire earnings growth in the bank's profits this year to $1.32 billion.  That is on top of the final 94c dividend it declared for its second half.  The one-off payment is equal to 1 per cent of the total offer price, and while the top-up is small, it has gone some way to accelerate the push for the merger which will see St George shareholders owning 30 per cent of the combined bank.  St George directors will also take three of the seats on the board of the revamped Westpac group, led by the chairman, John Curtis, who will become deputy chairman if the vote is overwhelmingly approved as expected.  Westpac will then move quickly to take formal control of its new subsidiary with the handover date now set for December 1.  That will also signal the end of St George's independence as a financial institution which began as a small Sydney building society in the 1930s before becoming a bank in 1992.  Westpac pledged in May to retain BankSA and other brands under its merger proposal for St George Bank. There would be no net reduction in ATMs or the retail network, it said in a 76-page document detailing the proposal.
