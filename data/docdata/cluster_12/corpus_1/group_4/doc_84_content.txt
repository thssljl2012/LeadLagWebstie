THE PARENT company of Leeds-based Yorkshire Bank plans to invest millions of pounds in Yorkshire businesses following a 1.3bn share  placement.  National Australia Bank (NAB) has raised the money to fund organic  growth and strengthen its balance sheet.  Chief executive John Stewart says the group is looking at a number of  opportunities in Yorkshire.  'We are planning to invest millions  in Yorkshire. If Yorkshire  businesses are in difficult times and are looking for someone to back them  we will.'  He said the aim of the fundraising was so that the bank could continue  to look after customers given the turmoil banks have got themselves  into.  He added: 'We will still be a prudent bank, but while banks all over the world are getting in to trouble and seeking government help, we  are in great shape.  'NAB is one of the most strongly capitalised banks in the world and is one of just over a dozen banks globally to hold a AA rating. This capital strength is terrific news for Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks.  'As well as providing certainty in the current environment, our capital strength is undoubtedly attractive and reassuring to business depositors and retail savings customers alike.  'We're also well placed to continue to explore quality organic opportunities in the UK and our other geographies.'
