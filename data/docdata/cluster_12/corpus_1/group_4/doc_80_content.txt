UK banks must take advantage of last week's announcement of 4 billion in funds from the European Investment Bank (EIB) the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has said. FSB National Chairman, John Wright, welcomed the announcement by the Chancellor but warned that the funds must be actively promoted by the banks in order for the support to trickle down to small businesses.  Speaking at a meeting with Alistair Darling, Business Secretary Lord Mandelson, EIB President Philippe Maystadt and business and banking representatives, Mr Wright said the EIB funds were a step in the right direction following the FSB's calls for a 1 billion Small Business Survival Fund.  However, he warned that banks and the Government must rewrite the application criteria to ensure that the money gets to those small businesses that need help immediately.  According to an FSB poll conducted over the last two days, one-third of small and medium sized businesses have seen an increase in costs on existing and new finance in the last two months, while another one in three complained about a decrease in the amount of new credit. Mr Wright said: 'The Government must insist more banks apply to the EIB so more small businesses can access the much needed funds. Over 80% of small businesses use the four major banks yet only one  Barclays  currently supplies EIB finance.'
