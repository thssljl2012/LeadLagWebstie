 Market watch top headlines Australian reports Aust markets:  :  :  World reports World commodities:  World markets:   WPL, SGB, WBC, CBA, LLC, FXJ, NHC, KCN, TEN, TAH, SHL, FPA, ABS,   AAP 2008-11-13   Digital media services group Destra Corporation Ltd has been placed in voluntary administration after television and radio station operator Prime Media Group Ltd withdrew financial support.  Richmond, Victoria-based Destra on Thursday appointed Tony Sims, Grant Sparks and Andrew Smith of PPB as administrators.  Prime had provided working capital assistance to Destra, which has attempted to deal with bank debt through asset sales. 'Continued adverse trends in the consumer and advertising markets and unprecedented capital market volatility have, however, contributed to making asset sales difficult,' Destra said. In addition, a party recently withdrew from sales negotiations. 'These events have significantly impacted the group's cash flow outlook,' Destra said. It posted a $79.45 million net loss for the year to June 30, 2008 compared to a $15.67 million net profit for the previous period.  The company had liabilities of $67.93 million at the end of the 2007/08 financial year.
