CHRISTMAS in Central Park was, by all accounts, a peak on the party calender. On a sultry night last November, Sydney's grassy Domain was transformed into wintry New York, with an artificial ice-skating rink ringed by lavish marquees styled like American diners, offering hamburgers, hot dogs and drinks for 1500 guests of financial firm Citigroup. 'It was a pretty flash do,' one guest says. As end-of-year parties go, the top end of town has always liked to celebrate in style.  But this year's party calendar looks like the poor cousin to the ghosts of Christmas past.   Christmas has been cancelled by several big Australian firms, including Citigroup, which have culled parties for staff and clients amid the global economic downturn. Others have scaled back on food, drink and guest lists rather than risk an excessive show of good cheer. 'We're not talking quite hair shirt stuff, but we are not in a money-spending mode,' says Barclays Capital chief executive Nicholas Johnson. 'Extravagance in the current climate by anybody is, I think, pretty inappropriate.' For Barclays, that has meant shifting the staff Christmas party from a waterfront restaurant to 'a few drinks in the boardroom full stop'. For other companies, Christmas has been cancelled outright. Investment firms ABN Amro, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, as well as credit card company American Express, are among those to have shelved staff and client Christmas celebrations until at least next year. Investment bank JPMorgan, which declined to comment, is also thought to have called off its end-of-year parties.  The trend was set during the Spring Racing Carnival at Flemington Racecourse, where the number of exclusive marquees was down for the first time in many years.   Citigroup spokeswoman Judy Hitchen says the decision to forgo an expensive Central Park-style party was about 'managing expenses to market conditions'. ABN Amro's 700 Australian staff received an internal memo a fortnight ago saying their end-of-year party was cancelled, in line with an edict from its owner, the dour Royal Bank of Scotland.
