-  Watch out for Opportunistic Thieves This Wintry Weekend  Organised car thieves will be roaming the streets this weekend looking for innocent motorists attempting to defrost their cars, warns Swinton (http://www.swinton.co.uk/).  Britain is facing a Baltic cold snap this weekend with the Met Office warning that we could face temperatures as low as minus 10degreesC on Saturday.  Motorists who leave their cars unattended to de-ice windscreens give thieves an open invitation and worse still, invalidate insurance policies says the UK's leading high street car insurance ( http://www.swinton.co.uk/car/) retailer, Swinton.  Steve Chelton, Insurer Development Manager at Swinton said: 'We are predicting a hike in these type of attacks during the cold snap this weekend. On frosty days it's incredible how many drivers leave their car running and nip back inside to finish getting ready - an open invitation for thieves.  'Last week in Manchester a gang who call themselves 'The Ice Bandits' were arrested over the theft of more than 40 cars which had been left running by their owners!'  Last year, Swinton (http://www.swinton.co.uk/) saw a 20% hike in the theft of cars by opportunistic ice-bandit type thieves.  Scotland and North Yorkshire are set to experience the coldest weather this weekend with London and the South East also in line for wintry conditions. Swinton is urging all drivers across the UK to take care this weekend.  On frosty winter mornings Swinton recommends that motorists use de-icer and a purpose-made ice scraper to clear the windscreen.
