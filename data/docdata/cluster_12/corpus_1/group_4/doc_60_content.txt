By Muhammad Ahmad Noorani  ISLAMABAD: The previous management of the Bank of Punjab (BoP), involved in the fraud of Rs 8.6 billion, was getting instructions directly from the top men of the then Punjab government and not from any player of the federal government, top NAB officials told The News.  They said they obtained this information during investigations of the arrested BoP officials. A senior NAB official, related with the case, told The News that the investigation conducted by the NAB points towards the then rulers of the Punjab as the BoP officials, who played a key role in awarding debts of Rs 8.6 billion on fake collaterals, NICs and documents, were receiving instructions from them.   Sources in the NAB say that even if the absconder Hamesh Khan, who was the president of the BoP at the time the loan was awarded, was appointed by some federal authority, the BoP officials involved were receiving instructions from top officials of the then Punjab government.
