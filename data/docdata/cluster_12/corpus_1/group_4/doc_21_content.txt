The outage followed a massive input of invalid data from one of the bank's big merchant customers.  An ANZ spokesman said the nationwide failure, which occurred at 1.45pm (AEDT), should be fixed by about 4.30pm. 'The slowness is causing time-outs for transactions in many cases which in turn is resulting in transactions not being processed,' the spokeswoman said. 'We're currently investigating what happened to make sure it won't occur again.''
