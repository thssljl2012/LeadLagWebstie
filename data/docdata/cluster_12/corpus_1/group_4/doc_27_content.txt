IMF Australia is preparing a potential class-action lawsuit against ABC Learning's receivers, auditors and former directors.  John Walker, the managing director of IMF  which organises class-action lawsuits  said he had the backing for the move of 20% of the failed child-care company's shareholders.  That 20% includes a mix of small 'mum and dad' investors and large corporate shareholders, he said.  Mr Walker said he would wait for Tuesday's creditors meeting to determine whether he would move legally, but was concerned the bank-appointed receivers would ensure a syndicate of eight banks, ABC's major financial creditors, would be paid at the expense of other creditors.  'Shareholders are worried that the company will be stripped for the banks and there will be nothing left,' he said.  Mr Walker also raised questions about the syndicate's 'secured position' as creditor of debts up to $1.25 billion in credits and shares.  An ASIC document shows on June 25 an 'oral agreement' for a charge was made between ABC Learning Development Pty Ltd, the principal company under the ABC umbrella, and CBA Corporate Service representing the bank. Mr Walker said yesterday that charge had provided no extra money to the now defunct child-care group, but rather had been made to secure the banks' money. The ASIC document filed on June 30 formalised the agreement.  Mr Walker said if the charge was made while the company was insolvent it would become void under section 588FJ of the Corporations Act.  'It will be up to the banks to prove that ABC Learning wasn't insolvent on June 25,' he said.  Last week The Age revealed the syndicate of eight major financial creditors had formed an alliance to keep ABC together into the new year, in part to improve its chances of getting a better return from any sale.  Representatives of the four major banks could not be contacted last night for comment.
