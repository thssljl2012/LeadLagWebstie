Filed under: Outsourcing  An ongoing battle for control of leading Dutch bank ABN-Amro appears certain to have huge repercussions for a number of IT outsource departments across the globe.  Barclays had appeared close to a deal for a big-money merger with the Amsterdam-based firm which would have had a major impact on the large IT outsource departments the pair employ.  Both companies have invested vast amounts of money on a multi-sourcing policy in recent years, engaging a number of different specialists to fit bespoke IT needs. Barclays in particular has been a keen outsourcer, conducting recent deals with large IT vendors such as IBM and Accenture as well as awarding smaller contracts to more specialist companies, such as Xansa and Getronics.  Any changes that might have been expected by a merger of the two banks, however, have now been thrown into doubt after the Royal Bank of Scotland entered the bidding with a bigger-value deal, worth some 49 billion, which also comes with the backing of the bank's allies, Spanish firm Santander and Belgian giant Fortis.  And with many financial analysts firm in their belief that the consortium deal may win the bidding war, a number of IT outsource departments in the UK and internationally will be anxiously awaiting the next salvo in the big-money banking deals.
