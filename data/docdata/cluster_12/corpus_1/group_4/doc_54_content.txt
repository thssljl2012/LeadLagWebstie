Altiums managing director, Simon Lord    The Manchester office of investment bank, Altium, has advised contract cleaning company LPM Group, which is backed by private equity house Sovereign Capital, on a 12m refinancing package to provide working capital and cash to support potential acquisitions.  Kent-based LPM, which significantly boosted its presence in Manchester when it bought rival firm Intercity Group in June for an undisclosed sum which boosted group turnover to 35m, secured the money from Clydesdale Bank, part of National Australia Bank.  Refinancing is vital to businesses as they grow and this transaction demonstrates that deals can still be achieved despite tightening lending conditions, said Altiums managing director Simon Lord.
