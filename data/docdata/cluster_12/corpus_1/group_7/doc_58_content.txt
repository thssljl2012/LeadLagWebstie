 (Repeats)  TAIPEI, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Foreign banks invested billions of dollars into Chinese banks earlier in the decade, seeking not only good investment opportunities but also future strategic partners to tap a fast-growing market.  But as they are squeezed for cash at home, a growing number are selling up to raise money, severing ties with valuable strategic partners.  Following are some of the major foreign banks that have sold some or part of their investments in Chinese banks in the past two months:  ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND  On Jan. 14, RBS said it sold a 4.26 percent stake in Bank of China for $2.34 billion. The sale was a clear sign the beleaguered British bank was scaling back its overseas ambitions.  BANK OF AMERICA  On Jan. 7, the largest U.S. bank by assets said it sold a 2.5 percent stake in China Construction Bank (CCB) for $2.83 billion.  UBS  On Dec. 31, UBS said it sold a 1.6 percent stake in Bank of China for $835 million, at a discount, to institutional investors. UBS was struggling to repair its balance sheet after massive investments in risky U.S. assets forced it to take nearly $49 billion of writedowns, more than any other European bank.  TEMASEK  The Singapore state investor has been rumoured to want to sell stakes in CCB and Mingsheng Bank. Temasek's portfolio shrank 31 percent in the eight months to November amid a rout in global financial markets, and CEO Ho Ching will step down in October to be replaced by Chip Goodyear, ex-CEO of BHP Billiton.
