Prudential's football-mad boss Mark Tucker is well aware what happened the last time the mighty insurer rolled out a hefty rights issue. It got a red card.  The one-for-six cash call at 308p went down like a lead balloon in the City. Indeed, it cost chief executive Jonathan Bloomer his job, because he had told institutional shareholders the group would not need to raise an additional 1bn capital to help fund UK expansion.  With Tucker now eyeing the Asian assets of stricken US insurer AIG, speculation has been rife that he would have to announce a major fundraising to finance any deal. Pru's shares have continued to reflect the uncertainty, losing an 81/4p gain to close a further 41/2p cheaper at 2561/2p.  Report from the LSE  But industry gossip last night suggested he has decided not to go down the rights issue route - at least not now. He still has much of the 527m sale proceeds from internet bank Egg in the group's coffers and can apparently draw on a war chest of 1bn-plus.  Bids for AIG's Philippine Life Insurance business have to be tabled by February 23 and the earliest the sale can be finalised is the first week of March. Prudential already generates a third of its profits in Asia and Tucker would love to get his hands on PLI.  Analysts will therefore be all ears today when the Pru reports sales figures for the fourth-quarter. The numbers will be fairly irrelevant as everyone will want to hear whether Asian expansion is on the immediate agenda.  Other insurers continued to wilt under aggressive selling pressure amid growing concern about the mountain of worthless debt securities they have been sold by beleaguered banks.  Rights issue gossip accompanied the 6p fall to 41.1p in Old Mutual Securities. Fund manager Landsdowne Partners has disclosed it holds a 0.31 per cent short position in the insurer.

Deutsche Bank remains cautious and says that although a lot of the bad news is in the price, experience from the banks sector suggests the shares will not recover quickly.  Lloyds broker Chaucer, on the other hand, rose 33/4p to 463/4p on persisting talk of a 61p a share cash offer from the sector's Footsie champion Amlin, 4p off at 351p.

A spokesman for fund manager SVG Investment Managers, which holds 7.2 per cent of StatPro, said: 'The group's funding success is due to its robust business model, good prospects for growth and cash generation'.
