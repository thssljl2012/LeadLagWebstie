ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., Feb. 9 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ --  EMCORE Corporation (Nasdaq: EMKR), a leading provider of compound semiconductor-based components and subsystems for the broadband, fiber optic, satellite, and terrestrial solar power markets, today announced preliminary unaudited financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2008.  Quarterly Results:  Revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $54.1 million, an increase of $7.2 million, or 15%, from $46.9 million reported in the same period last year and a decrease of $6.5 million, or 11%, from $60.6 million reported in the immediately preceding quarter. Both of the Company's reporting segments experienced an increase in quarterly revenue on a year-over-year basis. When compared to the immediately preceding quarter, revenue from the Fiber Optics segment decreased and revenue from the Photovoltaics segment increased.  Revenue for the Fiber Optics segment was $39.2 million, a $5.2 million, or 15%, increase from $34.0 million reported in the same period last year and a decrease of $6.9 million, or 15%, from $ 46.1 million reported in the preceding quarter. The year-over-year increase in Fiber Optics revenue was due primarily to the Company's February and April 2008 acquisitions of the telecom, datacom, and optical cable interconnects-related assets of Intel Corporation. The $6.9 million decrease in revenue from the preceding quarter was due primarily to a significant drop in demand from our customers in this very unfavorable macroeconomic environment as well as continued pressure on selling prices as we compete to maintain or increase our market share positions. We continue to receive design wins from major customers and believe that the Company is well-positioned for an increase in revenue once the overall economy improves. The Fiber Optics segment represented 72% of the Company's consolidated revenue for the first quarter of both fiscal 2009 and 2008.  Revenue for the Photovoltaics segment was $14.9 million, a $2.0 million, or 15%, increase from $12.9 million reported in the same period last year and an increase of $0.4 million, or 3%, from $14.5 million reported in the preceding quarter. On a year-over-year basis, all three of the Photovoltaics segment's product lines - satellite solar power, terrestrial concentrating photovoltaic ('CPV') and service contracts - experienced an increase in revenue. The Photovoltaics segment represented 28% of the Company's consolidated revenue for the first quarter of both fiscal 2009 and 2008.  After excluding non-recurring inventory reserve adjustments, as set forth in the attached non-GAAP tables, the first quarter consolidated gross profit, on a non-GAAP basis, was $7.2 million and the non-GAAP consolidated gross margin was 13.3%. On a GAAP basis, consolidated gross profit was $1.6 million, a $8.5 million, or 84%, decrease from $10.1 million reported in the same period last year and an increase of $2.1 million from a negative $0.5 million reported in the preceding quarter. On a GAAP basis, consolidated gross margin was 2.9% compared to 21.5% in the same period last year and an improvement from negative 0.8% in the preceding quarter.  On a segment basis, first quarter non-GAAP gross margin for the Fiber Optics segment was 11.2% and 18.8% for the Photovoltaics segment. On a GAAP basis, Fiber Optics gross margin was negative 1.1%, a decrease from 23.5% in the same period last year and 8.9% in the preceding quarter, with the decrease primarily due to a general decline in average selling prices, especially for the telecom component products, unabsorbed overhead expenses and inventory valuation write-downs totaling approximately $4.8 million. On a GAAP basis, Photovoltaics gross margin was 13.7%, a decrease from 16.4% in the same period last year with the decrease due primarily to lower terrestrial solar project margins, unabsorbed overhead expenses associated with our CPV-related business and inventory valuation write-downs of approximately $0.8 million. The Photovoltaics segment's first quarter gross margin represents a significant improvement from a negative 31.6% gross margin in the preceding quarter.  Sales, General, &amp; Administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 totaled $12.2 million, a slight increase from $11.9 million reported in the same period last year and a $4.8 million increase from $7.4 million in the preceding quarter. As a percentage of revenue, quarterly SG&amp;A expenses were 22.5%, a decrease from 25.3% in the same period last year and an increase from 12.3% in the preceding quarter. The decrease in year-over-year SG&amp;A expenses was primarily due to a reduction in non-recurring legal and professional fees and, to a lesser extent, on reduced staffing levels. The increase, when compared to the preceding quarter, was due to the reversal, in the preceding quarter, of certain incentive compensation and tax accruals that totaled approximately $5.2 million.  Research &amp; Development expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 totaled $8.1 million, an increase of $0.7 million, or 9%, from $7.4 million reported in the same period last year and a decrease of $3.3 million, or 29%, from $11.4 million reported in the preceding quarter. As a percentage of revenue, quarterly R&amp;D expenses were 15.0%, a decrease from 15.8% in the same period last year and from 18.7% in the preceding quarter. As part of the Company's continuing efforts to reduce costs, management has implemented initiatives to focus our R&amp;D efforts on projects that we expect to generate returns on within 12 months.  As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, the Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment as of December 31, 2008. As a result of the unfavorable macroeconomic environment and a significant reduction in the Company's market capitalization during the period, we determined that the goodwill related to our Fiber Optics segment was impaired resulting in a $31.8 million non-cash impairment charge. The Company also recorded a non-cash impairment charge totaling $1.9 million related to in-process research &amp; development (IPR&amp;D) acquired through the Company's February 2008 acquisition of the telecom-related assets of Intel Corporation. As part of cost cutting initiatives intended to generate cash, management discontinued certain R&amp;D projects, two of which were associated with the Company's capitalized IPR&amp;D. As of December 31, 2008, the Company's balance sheet no longer reflects any goodwill associated with its Fiber Optics segment or any capitalized IPR&amp;D.  After excluding non-cash and non-recurring expenses, as set forth in the attached non-GAAP tables, non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter totaled $16.5 million. On a GAAP basis, first quarter operating expenses totaled $54.1 million, an increase of $34.8 million from $19.3 million reported in the same period last year and an increase of $13.1 million from $41.0 million in the preceding quarter. In the prior year period, non-cash stock-based compensation expense totaled $0.8 million and, in the preceding quarter, operating expenses included $22.2 million in non-cash charges related to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets.  After excluding non-recurring and other non-cash charges, as set forth in the attached non-GAAP tables, the first quarter non-GAAP operating loss was $8.8 million. On a GAAP basis, the consolidated operating loss for the first quarter was $52.5 million, an increase of $43.3 million from a loss of $9.2 million reported in the same period last year and a $11.0 million increase from $41.5 million reported in the preceding quarter.  Non-operating expenses recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 included net interest expense of $0.1 million, $0.5 million of expense related to foreign exchange losses associated with the Company's international operations, and a $0.4 million non-cash impairment charge related to a publicly-traded available-for-sale security.  After excluding non-recurring, non-operating and other non-cash charges, as set forth in the attached non-GAAP tables, the first quarter non-GAAP net loss was $8.9 million. On a GAAP basis, the consolidated net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 was $53.4 million, an increase of $39.0 million from $14.4 million reported in the same period last year and an increase of $12.2 million from $41.2 million reported in the preceding quarter.

The December 31, 2008 order backlog is comprised of $30.2 million related to our Photovoltaics segment and $23.0 million related to our Fiber Optics segment.  Liquidity:  At December 31, 2008, cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and available for sale securities totaled approximately $18.8 million, working capital totaled $75.4 million, and outstanding loans under the Company's $25 million secured line of credit with Bank of America totaled $15.4 million. Shortly after the close of the first quarter, the Company sold its remaining interests in Entech Solar, Inc. (formerly named WorldWater and Solar Technologies Corporation) for $11.4 million in cash which is not reflected in the quarter-end cash balance. During the first quarter, the Company freed up $2.6 million in cash that was previously tied up in auction rate securities. As previously disclosed, the ...
