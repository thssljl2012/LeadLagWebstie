SHANGHAI, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp hopes soon to obtain regulatory approval for a fund management venture in China, the Shanghai Securities News reported on Tuesday. The planned venture with China's Western Securities, originally announced in November 2007, may win approval from Chinese regulators in the first half of this year, the U.S. bank's Asia Pacific chairman, Christopher Sturdy, was quoted as saying. Sturdy did not specify the size and structure of the venture, but when Bank of New York first announced its plan in 2007, it said the venture would be owned 51 percent by Western Securities and 49 percent by Bank of New York. The U.S. bank also plans to cooperate with major Chinese financial institutions in areas such as dollar settlements and trade financing, Sturdy was quoted as saying.
