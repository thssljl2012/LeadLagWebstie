SYDNEY -(Dow Jones)-  (WBK) said Friday it plans to raise around A$500 million in Tier 1 capital by issuing new listed hybrid securities, which will help boost balance sheet flexibility.  In a statement, Sydney-based Westpac said the hybrid securities, to be known as Westpac Stapled Preferred Securities II, will more effectively utilize Westpac's hybrid capacity following the redemption of St.George Hybrids in late March. 'Westpac SPS II will add to Westpac's capital resources and enhance its balance sheet flexibility,' Chief Financial Officer   Phil Coffey  said.  All Australia's major banks have sought to boost their Tier 1 capital positions in recent months to provide a bigger buffer against deteriorating market conditions and rising bad debt levels.   -By Lyndal McFarland, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-3-9650-0637; lyndal.mcfarland@ dowjones.com   (END) Dow Jones Newswires 02-19-092034ET Copyright (c) 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
