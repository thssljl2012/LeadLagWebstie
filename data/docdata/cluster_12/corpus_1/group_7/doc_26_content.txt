MORTGAGE Choice has suffered a 22 per cent slump in half-year profit and cut the size of its interim dividend.  The result comes after the slowing economy crippled demand for new home loans last year  But the mortgage broker is confident the combination of low interest rates, the Government's grant to first home buyers and declining house prices have put it in a good position for the second half of 2008-09.   The franchise's net profit fell to $8.25 million for the six months to December 31, from $10.6 million a year ago, while total revenue fell 6.7 per cent to $79.8 million from $85.5 million.   Revenue from new loans fell 21 per cent to $25.6 million. Managing director Paul Lahiff said this mirrored nationwide trends, with data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing nine months of consecutive declines in overall loan approvals from January last year.   The company said it would pay a first-half dividend of 4.75c a share compared with last year's 6c. 'There was no deliberate policy. We are looking to as best we can pay 100 per cent of profit out as dividend, but there was less profit to distribute, so we reduced the dividend by about 21 per cent,' Mr Lahiff said. Mortgage Choice's bottom line was also affected by the decision of lenders to reduce the size of their commission payments. Local lenders argued that because their funding costs had increased because of the credit crunch, they were less willing to pay the same level of commissions to brokers.   Mr Lahiff said this resulted in a 15-20 per cent reduction in bottom-line revenue.   To help offset this and the impact of a slowing economy, the broker diversified into personal loans, equipment leasing and insurance.   It offers personal loans through St George Bank and GE Money, equipment finance through Macquarie Bank and home and contents and life insurance through ALI. 'It's taking off, but at the end of the day our primary business is residential mortgages, so I don't think you are going to find that it is going to be more than 10 per cent of our overall revenue base,' Mr Lahiff said. Mr Lahiff expects the next six months to be easier than the last, and as such has adjusted the previously announced full-year profit forecast from a 45 per cent fall to a 25 per cent fall.   Mortgage Choice's share price rose 4.1 per cent yesterday to close at 76c.   Meanwhile, Financial planning group Count Financial, which made an unsuccessful informal offer for the broker in June, said it remained interested in the company. Count holds a 15.2 per cent stake.
