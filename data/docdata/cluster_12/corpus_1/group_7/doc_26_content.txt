ANZ has become the first of the 'Big Four'' banks to formally take the axe to its dividend as rising bad debts and impairment charges caused by the global financial crisis cuts a swathe through its profits.  The bank, which currently ranks number four by stock market capitalisation out of the majors, will slash its full year dividend by 25 per cent in order to bolster its balance sheet given the need to make further provisions against its earnings.  That will see the 2008 pay-out of $1.36 a share trimmed by around 34 cents by the time ANZ reports its full year results at the end of October.  Such a move will save the bank an estimated $500 million. The first sign of the extent of the dividend cut will come when the bank releases its first half year results for the six months ending March 31 on April 29.  ANZ sharesrose 9 cents, or 0.7%, to $12.59 in early trade, while the broader market gained 0.3%.  Cash earnings dive  The cut was flagged in a comprehensive trading update for the first four months of its current financial year in which the bank indicated that whilst its cash earnings - the industry's preferred measure of profit - were up 18% on the same period last year, further impairment charges would see the net figure dive by 11% to $1.2 billion.  That figure includes another $370 million set aside for a mark-to-market charge on trades on volatile credit markets. The post-tax charge will also include increasing impact of ANZ's exposure to complex derivative trades.  If those are excluded from the bank's performance in the four months to January, the bank said its earnings for period compared to 2008 would be down by 4%.  That was despite a 16% rise in income growth as ANZ benefited from a 'flight to quality'' as customers moved their money to what they regard are 'safer banks'' whilst the fall in the Australian dollar helped boost revenue in its global markets operation.  Its powerhouse domestic division also gained from similar factors, in particular the majors' grip on the local lending market, albeit ANZ said that volume growth had slowed.  And while profit before rising bad debts was 14% ahead, the division will report only flat earnings at the first half as a direct consequence of higher bad debt charges.  Such a factor is beginning to blight the forthcoming results of the majors, with Commonwealth, Westpac and National Australia Bank all indicating that the tide of poorly performing loans in the corporate sector was beginning to sweep into the wider economy.  Bad debts in line  ANZ also confirmed today that its current bad debt charges to cover collective and individual provisions was running at between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion - in line with the industry's's expectations and higher than in 2008.  This was a direct result on the economic slowdown with the figure set to be impacted by the downturn now hitting its major domestic market.  As a result, analysts have indicated that the banks would be under pressure to cut their dividend payouts in order to conserve cash as they bunker down to see out what is likely to be a tough 12 to 18 months before the recession-hit global economy starts to recover.  CommBank and Westpac have dropped veiled hints that their payouts to shareholders could be trimmed in coming months but ANZ, which was the first 'major'' to start raising its bad debt charges substantially, has taken the bolder although riskier line by taking a lead in actually doing so.
