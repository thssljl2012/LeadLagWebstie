SAS, business analytics and software services company, has had a solid year in the Australian market, with growth in new software licence revenue in 2008 despite tightening economic conditions.  SASs managing director for Australia and New Zealand, Gordon Clubb, said our 2008 growth in new software licence revenue was particularly gratifying, coming in at eight per cent over the number for 2007, and the number of employees also grew in 2008, up nearly 10 per cent to 210.  Clubb said new customers for SAS Australia last year included Elders, Data Action and Australian Central Credit Union, while National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Bankwest/HBOS were among existing customers who expanded their use of SAS' market analytics and business intelligence solutions.  SAS Australia also achieved strong growth in its customer education business, reflecting the desire of organisations to continue to drive an increasing return on their SAS investment, Clubb added.  Clubb said the focus going forward would be on business analytics and 'in today's testing business climate, organisations must switch the operational emphasis from automation to innovation.'
