FT reports: The liquidators of Lehman Brothers' Hong Kong operations have been approached by more than 250 parties interested in the bank's assets, it has been disclosed.  Prospective buyers include private equity groups, hedge funds and property investors. The unexpected level of interest offers hope to thousands of creditors of the eight Hong Kong entities, which account for the bulk of the bank's Asian operations excluding Japan.  The revelation came at a media briefing in Hong Kong, the first since KPMG, the professional services firm, was appointed as a liquidator after the collapse of the US bank in September.
