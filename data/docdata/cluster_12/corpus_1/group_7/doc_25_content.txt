Emmanuel and Julie Cassimatis hope to revive Storm primarily to pursue claims of negligence and other alleged wrongdoing by the Commonwealth Bank and other lenders.  'The CBA has shut us down and we intend to fight this injustice,' the couple said yesterday.  'The bank deceived us and, more importantly, deceived our (their) clients, many of whom had made a fortune for the bank as the market rose, by saying we were responsible for the margin loan accounts.'  The Commonwealth Bank has denied any wrongdoing.  Storm, based in Townsville, collapsed with debts of more than $78 million last month.  Many of the firm's 14,000 clients who took out margin loans face huge debts and the loss of their homes because of the stockmarket's nosedive.  Storm administrators Raj Khatri and Ivor Worrell of Worrells Solvency and Forensic Accountants will recommend a course of action when they convene the second meeting of creditors, probably next month.
