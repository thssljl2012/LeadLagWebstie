Year End 2008 Financial Results  For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company reported net income of $278.7 million, or $3.46 per diluted share, on revenues of $533.8 million, as compared to net income of $25.4 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, on revenues of $294.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Net income for 2008 included a pre-tax gain on derivatives not designated as hedges of $249.9 million and 2007 net income included a pre-tax loss on derivatives not designated as hedges of $20.3 million. EBITDAX (defined as net income, plus (1) exploration and abandonments expense, (2) depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, (3) accretion expense, (4) impairments of long-lived assets, (5) non-cash stock-based compensation expense, (6) ineffective portion of cash flow hedges and unrealized (gain) loss on derivatives not designated as hedges, (7) interest expense, (8) bad debt expense and (9) federal and state income taxes, less other ancillary income including interest income, gathering income and rental income) increased to $400.6 million in 2008, as compared to $216.3 million in 2007.  Production for 2008 totaled 7.1 million barrels of oil equivalents (MMBoe) (4.6 million barrels of oil (MMBbls) and 15.0 billion cubic feet of natural gas (Bcf), an increase of 41% as compared to 5.0 MMBoe (3.0 MMBbls and 12.1 Bcf) produced in 2007. Excluding production from properties acquired in the acquisition of Henry Petroleum LP and certain of its affiliated entities (Henry), 2008 production increased 24% over 2007.  Timothy A. Leach, Concho's Chairman and CEO, commented, Despite difficult market conditions at year end, 2008 was an outstanding year for Concho. During the year, we made significant operational advances on our core New Mexico Permian assets, added a new core area in the Wolfberry, and grew proved reserves significantly despite a more than $50 per barrel drop in oil prices from year end 2007 to year end 2008.  Oil and gas production expense for 2008, including taxes, totaled $91.2 million, or $12.88 per barrel of oil equivalent (Boe), a 19% increase per Boe over 2007. This increase was due primarily to higher commodity prices, resulting in significantly greater production taxes, (which averaged $6.18 per Boe in 2008 as compared to $4.84 per Boe in 2007) and the addition of the Henry properties, which have higher per unit operating expenses than the Companys legacy properties.  Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense (DD&amp;A) for 2008 totaled $123.9 million, or $17.50 per Boe, compared to $76.8 million, or $15.28 per Boe, in 2007. The increase in depletion expense was primarily due to the Henry acquisition for which the depletion rate was higher than the Companys legacy assets, the capitalized costs associated with new wells that were successfully drilled and completed and the downward revision in proved reserves at year end 2008 as a result of the decrease in year end oil and natural gas prices used to determine proved reserves.  Exploration and abandonment costs for 2008 totaled $38.5 million, an increase of 32% over 2007. The increase was primarily due to $31.6 million of leasehold abandonments, principally related to exploration acreage outside of the Companys core operating areas. The largest components of this charge were related to the Companys leasehold positions in the West Texas Barnett / Woodford Shale play in Culberson County, Texas ($9.7 million), and the Fayetteville Shale play in Arkansas ($9.0 million).  Impairments of long-lived assets increased to $18.4 million in 2008 as compared to $7.3 million in 2007. This increase was primarily the result of lower commodity prices at year end 2008 as compared to 2007.  General and administrative expense (G&amp;A) for 2008 totaled $40.8 million. Recurring cash G&amp;A for 2008 totaled $31.3 million, stock-based compensation (non-cash) totaled $5.2 million, and $4.3 million was attributable to certain employee bonuses to be paid over a two year period commencing July 31, 2008 under the terms of the Henry purchase agreement.  Net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008 included the effect of a $249.9 million pre-tax gain on derivatives not designated as hedges, $6.3 million of which was cash payments attributable to settlements of derivative contracts and $256.2 million of which was a non-cash mark-to-market unrealized gain. Additionally, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, the Company paid cash settlements totaling approximately $30.6 million associated with its derivatives contracts designated as cash flow hedges (accounted for as a reduction in oil revenues).  Total costs incurred for oil and natural gas properties was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008, including $339.0 million for exploration and development drilling activities and $838.0 million for property acquisitions (including $206.5 million of deferred tax liability recorded with the Henry acquisition).  Fourth Quarter 2008 Financial Results  For the three months ended December 31, 2008, Concho reported net income of $128.8 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, on revenues of $119.2 million, as compared to net income of $6.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, on revenues of $98.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2007. EBITDAX increased to $103.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2008, as compared to $75.5 million in the same period of 2007.  Production for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 totaled 2.3 MMBoe (1.6 MMBbls and 4.6 Bcf), an increase of 65% as compared to 1.4 MMBoe (0.9 MMBbls and 3.2 Bcf) produced in the quarter ended December 31, 2007. Excluding production from properties acquired in the Henry acquisition, fourth quarter 2008 production increased 28% over fourth quarter 2007 production.  Oil and gas production expense, including taxes, for the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled $25.3 million, or $10.94 per Boe, a 6% per Boe decrease over the $11.67 per Boe in the fourth quarter 2007. This decrease in per unit oil and gas production expense was due primarily to lower production taxes per BOE ($3.86 per BOE in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $6.20 per BOE in the fourth quarter of 2007) as a result of lower commodity prices in the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, which was partially offset by the higher per unit operating costs of the Henry properties as compared to the Companys legacy properties.  DD&amp;A for the fourth quarter 2008 was $20.77 per Boe, compared to $15.53 per Boe in the same period of 2007. The increase in fourth quarter DD&amp;A expense was primarily due to the acquisition of the Henry properties for which the depletion rate was higher than the Companys legacy assets, capitalized costs associated with new wells that were successfully drilled and completed, and the decrease in the oil and natural gas prices between the periods which were utilized to determine the proved reserves.  Exploration and abandonment costs for the fourth quarter of 2008 totaled $18.2 million. Approximately $16.6 million resulted from acreage impairment costs associated with the Companys undeveloped leasehold in various non-core assets, including the previously mentioned West Texas Barnett/Woodford Shale and the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas.  G&amp;A for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 totaled $13.7 million. Recurring cash G&amp;A for the quarter totaled $11.4 million, stock-based compensation (non-cash) totaled $0.3 million, and the remaining $2.0 million was attributable to certain employee bonuses to be paid over a two year period commencing July 31, 2008 under the terms of the Henry purchase agreement.  Fourth quarter 2008 net income included the effect of a $206.2 million pre-tax gain on derivatives not designated as hedges; $22.8 million of which were cash receipts attributable to settlements of derivative contracts and $183.4 million of which was a non-cash mark-to-market unrealized gain. For the quarter, the Company received cash settlements totaling approximately $2.1 million associated with its derivatives contracts designated as cash flow hedges (accounted for as an increase in oil revenues).  Operations  For the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, the Company commenced the drilling of or participated in a total of 243 wells (199 operated), 211 of which had been completed as producers and 31 of which were in progress and one of which was unsuccessful as of December 31, 2008. In addition, the Company participated in 242 gross recompletions (226 operated), 220 of which had been completed as producers, 17 of which were in progress and five of which were unsuccessful as of December 31, 2008.
