ING Medical Properties Trust joined other listed property entities yesterday in reporting a bottom-line loss arising from non-cash items for the December half. Unlike others reporting recently, its operating profit before tax &amp; unrealised elements was down. Revaluations didnt feature. That pretax &amp; pre-unrealiseds profit was down 10.1% to $5.87 million, on revenue up 13% to $11.3 million. The trust had a $4.7 million unrealised forex gain ($207,000 in 2007), but swung from a $1.3 million gain on interest-rate swaps to a $15.7 million loss. The trust had a $2.95 million tax gain in 2007, but a $2.4 million expense this time, taking net earnings from a $5.1 million profit to a $2.8 million loss, down 156%. Basic &amp; diluted earnings/unit dropped from 3.62c to a negative 2.01c.  Nevertheless, the general manager of trust management company ING Medical Properties Ltd, David Carr, was delighted with the performance: For the 12 months to December 2008 the trust was the top-performing NZ Stock Exchange-listed property stock, with a positive gross return of 1.13%, compared to the sector average gross return of minus 20.8%. The trust also outperformed all Australian listed property entities during the period and was the third best-performing stock in the NZX50 Gross Index. The trusts portfolio remains well established against the ongoing headwinds of a weak economic climate, as is shown by the improvement in occupancy levels by over 2% since June 2008. The medical &amp; healthcare activities of the trusts tenants provide a high degree of occupational &amp; rental income certainty in the current environment, as the demand for medical &amp; healthcare services continues to expand. This, in conjunction with Australasias aging demographic profile, increased public health expenditure &amp; growing numbers of people taking out private medical insurance, places the trust in a more defensive &amp; resilient position. The trust is firmly positioned to capitalise on the opportunities in the sector, including current discussions with a number of the trusts existing tenants about making provision for their future growth &amp; occupancy requirements. Mr Carr said the operating profit fell primarily as a result of the increase in the trusts cost of debt and the staged leasing-up of Ascot Central. Mark-to-market adjustments on interest-rate hedges &amp; foreign currency positions were made in accordance with IFRS reporting standards.  He said the accounting treatment of these unrealised items would have no effect on the trusts cashflow position or cash distributions to unitholders for the year, and the trust had reaffirmed its year-end cash distribution guidance of 8.5c/unit (including a second-quarter distribution of 2.125c in cash, no imputation credits). The trusts banking facility with the ANZ National Bank is committed through to March 2011, and this will provide investors with confidence that the bank fully supports the trust &amp; its activities. The proceeds of $4.3 million received from the deferred settlement of the Waitemata land sale have been used to reduce the trusts debt:total-assets ratio to 33.9%. Mr Carr said progress on leasing at Ascot Central had taken the portfolio occupancy level from 94.3% to 96.4%. Ascot Central occupancy is at 75%. Only 3% (by income) of the trusts leases are due to expire in the June half. Beyond that, 2% will expire in each of the following 2 years.  The trust completed 22 rent reviews in the December half, 19 of them CPI-based reviews, which achieved an average increase of 4.9% over the passing rent. The trust has 35 rent reviews remaining to June, with about 80% to be reviewed by CPI.  bobdey@propbd.co.nz.
