NEWSPAPER group Johnston Press look set to sell their Irish titles to help tackle a 465million debt burden.  The publishers, who also own The Scotsman and regional papers in England, have appointed Dublin's Raglan Capital to deal with bids.  Among the titles they are believed to want to offload are the Leinster Leader and the Kilkenny People.  Edinburgh firm Johnston grew rapidly under former boss Tim Bowdler, who turned them into the UK's second largest newspaper group.  But as advertising revenues have fallen, the group's share price has dived from 4.90 in 2007 to just 8p yesterday.  Johnston have also appointed accountants KPMG to negotiate with their banks.  They hope Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and National Australia Bank will agree to refinancing debt facilities, which are due to expire in September next year.  Yesterday's accouncements came weeks after new chief executive John Fry took up his post after a boardroom reshuffle.
