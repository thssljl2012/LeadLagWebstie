 The recent approach from Cowdery's Resolution investment vehicle was discussed by the Prudential board but no more talks are taking place.  Cowdery is thought to have made other approaches since Resolution floated on the stock market last December, raising 600m from investors including the Pru. advertisement The Sunday Telegraph said other businesses on the shopping list were likely to include life assurer Clerical Medical and Friends Provident.  The newspaper said the Prudential was prepared for Cowdery to renew his advances. And while the Pru is willing to consider a sale of the business, any buyer would have to pay a large premium to the implied stock market value.  Cowdery - a former insurance salesman - founded the Resolution insurance com-pany in 2003 and went on to buy a number of assets and firms, including Swiss Life UK and the life businesses of Abbey National in 2006.  It was bought by Pearl Assurance for 4.98bn last year before Cowdery launched a new investment business with the same name.  Resolution is hoping to build an acquisition warchest of more than 5bn to snap up firms across life assurance and savings sectors, banking and credit, asset management and insurance markets.  The sale of the Pru's UK arm would enable the blue-chip firm to focus on its faster-growing Asian operation.  It is currently examining a bid on its own or with a partner for the Asian insurance assets of the AIG Group.  The Pru's shares surged 28.5p to 285p on Friday after it reassured investors on its capital position, announcing a 1.7bn buffer and annuity funds that could withstand a repeat of the Great Depression.  It also posted better-than-expected full year new business figures, with UK sales ahead by 4% at 947m in 2008.
