SYDNEY, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp, Australia's No. 2 lender, has launched a Tier 1 capital issue of around A$500 million ($323 million) to replace a maturing hybrid issue and boost its balance sheet, it said on Friday. The issue, called Westpac Stapled Preferred Securities II (Westpac SPS II), offers a mandatory conversion after five years, mirroring Tier 1 issues by other Australian banks. Tier 1 is a form of very liquid capital that banks are required to maintain as a cushion to protect bank deposits. It is the closest type to equity and also the most expensive form of debt for banks. The last Australian Tier 1 offer took place five months ago when Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group raised just over A$1 billion in similar securities due in 2014 at 250 basis points over BBSW. Westpac's SPS II consist of preferred securities that will mandatorily convert into ordinary shares with a 1 percent discount in September 2014. Initial pricing suggested a margin between 370 and 400 basis points over the bank bill swap rate. The margin will be determined on Feb. 27 following a one-day institutional bookbuild. The offer primarily targets holders of securities issued by St George Bank, now part of Westpac, and maturing on March 31. It is also offered to new investors. The issue is led by a large syndicate of joint books including Citi, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs JBWere, Macquarie, nabCapital, UBS and Westpac. The securities are expected to be rated A+ by S&amp;P and Aa3 by Moody's, with distributions to be fully franked, non-cumulative and based on a floating rate. Key dates of the offer: Bookbuild: Feb. 26 Announcement of margin: Feb. 27 Closing of offer: March 27 Issue date: March 31 Mandatory conversion: Sept. 30, 2014 ($1=1.549 Australian Dollar) (Reporting by Cecile Lefort) Keywords: WESTPAC/ (cecile.lefort@reuters.com; +612-9373-1234; Reuters Messaging: cecile.lefort.reuters.com@reuters.net) COPYRIGHT Copyright Thomson Reuters 2009.
