Berkery Noyes Teams Up with Seneca Financial Group to Provide Restructuring Advice  - Strategic partnership to aid troubled companies -  NEW YORK, Feb. 17 /PRNewswire/ --  Highlights:     --  Berkery Noyes and Seneca Financial Group form partnership offering         restructuring services.     --  Corporate restructuring is often a better choice than bankruptcy.     --  Team of experienced professionals has proven track record of success.     Berkery, Noyes &amp; Co., LLC (www.berkerynoyes.com) and Seneca Financial Group (www.senecafinancial.com) are pleased to announce the formation of a strategic partnership to advise companies seeking restructuring services in the global information, media, health and pharmaceutical industries, as well as education, financial, B2B, marketing services, and related technology areas. Armed with deep market knowledge, the partners will work with companies to develop new business models to reflect the realities of the current economic and financial marketplace, as well as restructure balance sheets that are over-leveraged by today's standards.  John Shea (http://www.berkerynoyes.com/team/member/john%20t._shea.aspx), Chief Operating Officer of Berkery Noyes commented: 'Given today's economic environment, we anticipate a growing need for our brand of on-the-ground advisory service.  A company's successful restructuring hinges upon having a team comprised of professionals who understand a business and its industry in a granular sense and have the capability to devise and implement a successful restructuring plan.'  'The fundamentals of the restructuring business have changed in profound ways over the past three years. Today's bankruptcy code makes it very difficult for a company to successfully reorganize under the court's supervision,' said James Harris (http://www.senecafinancial.com/SenecaProfessionals/President.html), founder and CEO of Seneca. 'Bankruptcy may no longer be the right answer.  Given current conditions, companies would be well advised to examine other options to transform their businesses into more efficient generators of cash flow.'  James Harris founded Seneca Financial Group in 1993 to focus exclusively on restructuring advisory services (http://www.senecafinancial.com/Services/fin_rest/index.html). A sample of Seneca's previous engagements include: Texaco, Federated Department Stores, LTV Corporation, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Parmalat and America West Airlines.  Prior to founding Seneca, Mr. Harris was a Managing Director at Lehman Brothers and headed the firm's restructuring advisory services. Prior to joining Lehman in 1982, Mr. Harris was a senior lending officer at Citibank N.A. where he worked with Mr. Shea.  Berkery, Noyes &amp; Co., LLC has completed over 450 M&amp;A transactions since its founding by Joseph Berkery in 1988. Since its inception, Berkery Noyes has focused its efforts on the information and media industries (http://www.berkerynoyes.com/pages/sectors/index.aspx).
