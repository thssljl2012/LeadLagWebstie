LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland is looking to sell all or part of the Asian operations it acquired when it bought parts of ABN Amro in 2007 and to dispose of its Charter One commercial banking business in the Midwest United States, The Independent newspaper reported on Friday. RBS had sounded out Asia-focussed bank Standard Chartered and Australia's ANZ about buying the Asian operations, including assets in India, the newspaper reported without citing any sources. The Independent said RBS was understood to be considering selling retail banking operations in the region while keeping licences and a wholesale banking foothold in key centres such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and India. The bank's Indian retail business is the most desirable part of RBS's Asian network given restrictions on opening branches in the country, the newspaper reported, adding that ANZ would need to acquire a licence to do a deal given that it sold its Indian business to Standard Chartered in 2000. In the United States the newspaper reported that RBS wanted to sell the Charter One brand operating in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio which it bought in 2004 for $10.5 billion. The British bank hoped to keep its retail banking operations on the East Coast, it added. Finding a buyer for Charter One could prove tough in the current environment but RBS had received at least one expression of interest, The Independent said. A spokeswoman for RBS said that, as previously announced, a strategic review was underway at the bank. 'We would not comment on any speculation that might pre-empt the strategic review,' the spokeswoman said. The bank's acquisition spree over the last 10 years has been widely blamed for making it vulnerable to a global financial crisis that has seen the British government bail out RBS, taking a 70 percent stake in the 282-year-old lender.
