Organisers of a meeting of Storm Financial investors in far north Queensland are expecting a strong crowd in Cairns tonight.  The Townsville-based financial services company collapsed in January after the Commonwealth Bank demanded full repayment of corporate debt.  It is estimated former clients in the Cairns region have accumulated debts of more than $100 million.  The Storm Investment Consumer Action Group was set up in response to the collapse and has been holding meetings in regional centres to keep angry investors informed.  About 600 people met in Townsville last month and similar gatherings have been held in Rockhampton and Mackay this week.  About 200 people are expected to turn out in Cairns this evening.  Many Storm clients are facing financial ruin after losing their life savings.
