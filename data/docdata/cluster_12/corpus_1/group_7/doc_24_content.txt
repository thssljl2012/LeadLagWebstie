Shearman &amp; Sterling has posted a 4.9% dip in revenues to $876m (608m) for 2008, along with a 9.6% fall in profits per equity partner to $1.665m (1.15m). The firm's London office posted a 14.1% drop in revenue, down from $132.6m (94.6m) in 2007 to $113.8m (79.1m). The percentage declines recorded by Shearman were similar to those reported by Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom and in the middle of the pack for major New York firms that have so far posted their results. 'It was the second-best year in the firm's history,' said senior partner Rohan Weerasinghe. 'That we did as well as we did is a testament to the strength of our platform globally.' Shearman is more global than some of its US peers, with 45% of its lawyers based overseas, but less diversified in its practice mix, with only 22% of its revenues deriving from litigation.  Weerasinghe identified Shearman's global leveraged finance group, and its London office generally, as weak performers, though he added that many corporate lawyers were busy restructuring their old deals.  One bright spot is the Abu Dhabi office, which is doubling in size, and last year represented the Mubadala sovereign wealth fund in forming a joint venture with General Electric. Another is Latin-American project finance. Shearman recently advised the banks on a pair of billion-dollar Chilean projects, and helped the Panama Canal Authority to finance its historic $5.25bn (3.64bn) expansion. A third bright spot is the arbitration group led by Emmanuel Gaillard, whose top clients, the Algerian energy group SONATRACH and the former shareholders of Yukos, are among the world's most litigious. Despite the M&amp;A slump, Weerasinghe says that his corporate group 'did fine' last year. Shearman's headline deals at the end of the boom included Huntsman's aborted acquisition by Hexion, Dow Chemical's aborted joint venture with Kuwait, and Dow's delayed acquisition of Rohm &amp; Haas. Post-boom, Shearman represented Merrill Lynch in its acquisition by Bank of America, and the firm is helping Bank of America to unwind its derivative contracts with Lehman Brothers.  Rivals are now asking if Shearman will suffer in the long term after the fall of Merrill Lynch, of most lucrative clients. Former managing partner John Madden said that while Bank of America's general counsel's office remains in flux, Shearman did work for both legacy banks, and hopes to broaden its relationship.  Weerasinghe argued that Shearman is well-positioned to weather the downturn because it had spurned aggressive growth during his three years at the helm, negotiated favorable real estate leases, and trimmed its long-term debt by nearly 40%. There are no current plans to match rival firms' layoffs. 'I look on 2009 as a period of challenge,' says Weerasinghe, 'but also a time of tremendous opportunity.'  Shearman &amp; Sterling on the
