Insurance tycoon Clive Cowdery has sounded out Prudential to see if it is willing to sell its UK business, reports said .  The recent approach from Mr Cowdery's Resolution investment vehicle was discussed by the Prudential board but no more talks are taking place.  Mr Cowdery is thought to have made other approaches since Resolution floated on the stock market last December, raising 600 million from investors including the Pru. The Sunday Telegraph said other businesses on the shopping list were likely to include life assurer Clerical Medical and Friends Provident.  The newspaper said the Prudential was prepared for Mr Cowdery to renew his advances. And while the Pru is willing to consider a sale of the business, any buyer would have to pay a large premium to the implied stock market value.  Mr Cowdery - a former insurance salesman - founded the Resolution insurance company in 2003 and went on to buy a number of assets and firms, including Swiss Life UK and the life businesses of Abbey National in 2006.  It was bought by Pearl Assurance for 4.98 billion last year before Mr Cowdery launched a new investment business with the same name. Resolution is hoping to build an acquisition war chest of more than 5 billion to snap up firms across life assurance and savings sectors, banking and credit, asset management and insurance markets.  The sale of the Pru's UK arm would enable the blue-chip firm to focus on its faster-growing Asian operation. It is currently examining a bid on its own or with a partner for the Asian insurance assets of the AIG Group.  The Pru's shares surged on Friday after it reassured investors on its capital position, announcing a 1.7 billion buffer and annuity funds that could withstand a repeat of the Great Depression.  It also posted better-than-expected full year new business figures, with UK sales ahead by 4% at 947 million in 2008.
