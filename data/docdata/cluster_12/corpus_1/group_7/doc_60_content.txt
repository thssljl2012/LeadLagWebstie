SYDNEY, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Investec Bank (Australia), a unit of Investec, has priced A$200 million ($127.7 million) of five-year bonds backed by an Australian government guarantee at 130 basis points over swap, a market source said on Wednesday. The offer, which was Investec's second issue under the guarantee introduced in November, was jointly led by Commonwealth Bank of Australia and UBS. Australian banks have this year raised more than A$57 billion equivalent of funds under the government guarantee. Most of the bonds were sold in U.S. and Australian dollars and are all rated triple A by S&amp;P and Moody's. Spreads of government-guaranteed bonds have tightened significantly in the last weeks as investors become more familiar with the asset class, a banker said. Bonds issued by Australia's major banks only pay around 15 basis points more than similarly rated bonds issued by semi-government borrowers such as Australian state treasury departments, down from a gap of around 100 basis points in December. Investec earlier in the month sold A$400 million of three-year bonds backed by the government at 125 basis points over swap and BBSW. Investec is part of the Investec group operating in South Africa, the UK and Australia. The Australian unit is regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.
