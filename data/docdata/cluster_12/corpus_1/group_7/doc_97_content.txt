Integrates FlexFutures Algorithmic Trading Platform Were very pleased that Millburn Ridgefield has chosen FlexFutures as its algorithmic execution platform, said Vijay Kedia, president and CEO of FlexTrade. As todays listed-derivatives markets become more automated, its critical for asset management firms such as Millburn to have access to innovative execution tools to reduce market impact and minimize slippage. With FlexFutures, Millburn can execute through multiple brokers from a single front-end, using an array of sophisticated, customizable algorithms. Built to seamlessly integrate with order management systems, black boxes, and other proprietary or third-party systems, FlexFutures comes fully integrated with real-time allocations, compliance and broker restrictions, and is pre-loaded with a suite of rules-based trading execution strategies, including enhanced Icebergs and Time Slicing, which can also be used to execute exchange-listed calendar spreads. While there were many off-the-shelf front-ends available for trading futures, we found that FlexTrades execution management software was able to provide the deep level of sophistication and customization we required, said John Mattia, Vice President of Trading. FlexTrade is now fully integrated into our trade-execution process. FlexTrade has been able to scale to all the exchanges and products that we trade quite well, and its flexibility has allowed us to quickly adapt to changing market conditions.
