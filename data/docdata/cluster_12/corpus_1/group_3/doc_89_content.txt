A rare 1million bank note is being sold at auction today - with a guide price of only 40,000. Unfortunately, the deal isn't quite as good as it seems, as the note is no longer legal tender.It was one of seven given to the UK by the U.S. in the Marshall Aid plan after the Second World War.Wartime credit crunch: The US issued this rare 1 million bank note to a bankrupt Britain after World War IIThe U.S. gave the huge loan to the Bank of England in a bid to prop up the ailing economy at the time. The nine 1 million notes were shared around the financial institutions and were used to loan money against.The deal has startling similarities to today's global financial crisis, except in this case the bank had to pay the money back.Although the notes - numbered 000001 to 000009 - were cancelled just two months later in October 1948, Britain has only recently finished repaying the debt.Seven of the notes were destroyed while the other two were given as mementos to the respective US and British Treasury secretaries at the time.One of them is now owned by businessman Bill Parkinson who has spent 50 years amassing a stunning collection of 253 vintage bank notes which he is now selling.The one million pound note - the highest valued bill in the world - has a guide price of 40,000 while an 1832 5 version is set to fetch 35,000. The entire collection is valued at 500,000. Tristan Chant, of London-based Spink auctioneers which is selling the notes, said: 'The one million pound note is part of a very good collection.'It is on Bank of England watermarked paper and was issued by the Treasury.'It was issued in connection with the Marshall Aid plan after World War Two and was intended for internal use between financial institutions as a way of tracking money.'The notes were in use for only a period of six weeks and were not meant for public circulation.'It is one of the rarest examples of British currency around today and is the highest denomination note.'Mr Parkinson, 68, who owns Moorhouse Brewery in Burnley, Lancashire, started his collection through a friend who worked as a bank clerk for Lloyds.He said: 'One day a farmer came in with 400 pounds in one pound notes.'They turned out to be treasury notes from the First World War and my friend brought some to show me.'I bought four at face value and that's how I got interested in collecting bank notes.'But the collection has got so big that the only notes I don't have are so rare and expensive that if I was to buy them it would cost me too much.'If you collect paintings you can hang them up and appreciate them, but with some of mine they are so valuable I have to keep them locked up in a bank and there's no enjoyment in that.'Mr Parkinson said the time was right to sell the notes while he had control over the collection, especially as his three children had no interest in the notes.The one million pounds note, which is green and eight-inches wide, is a Treasury note issued on August 30, 1948.Printed on it is the wording: 'This Treasury note entitles the Bank of England to payment of one million pounds on demand out of the consolidated fund of the United Kingdom.'There is also a stamp mark on it showing the date of October 6, 1948 which was when the note was cancelled.Britain wasn't alone in receiving funds under the Marshall Aid plan.From 1948 to 1951 the US loaned seven billion pounds - about 100 billion pounds in today's money - to western European countries.The US was happy to loan the money at the time as it took the view that a strong western Europe was needed to act as a buffer to contain the rise of communism in Russia.The second one million pound note was sold by Spink auctions about 20 years ago to another private collector.The sale will take place at Spink's auction house in Bloomsbury.No comments have so far been submitted.
