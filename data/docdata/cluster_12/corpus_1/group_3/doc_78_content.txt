Dale, president and CEO of CLIA.The Contribution of the North American Cruise Industry to the U.S. Economy in 2007 study was conducted by Business Research &amp;amp; Economic Advisors (BREA) in Exton, Pa., and analyzes the economic benefits to the U.S. economy from five principal sources: spending by cruise passengers and crew; shoreside staffing by cruise lines in U.S. cities; expenditures by cruise lines for goods and services; U.S. port services; and vessel maintenance and repair.Among other key Hawaii findings:     --  Tourism-related businesses such as tour operators, airlines, hotels,        restaurants and providers of ground transportation were the        beneficiaries of nearly two-thirds of the cruise industry spending,        receiving $462 million.    --  Another $32 million was spent with businesses in such sectors as food        processors, petroleum refiners, insurance companies, advertising        agencies and health services providers. Nationwide, the North American cruise industry continued to have a significant and growing impact on the U.S. economy in 2007, positively affecting every state in the country.
