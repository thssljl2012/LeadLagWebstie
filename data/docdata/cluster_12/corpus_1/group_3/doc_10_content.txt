 CUTTING the number of smoking areas in the CBD will force people to light up on public footpaths, Launceston smokers said yesterday.The claim comes after the Launceston City Council decided to look at banning smoking in Trustees Court, near the Centreway Arcade, where a $150,000 public toilet development will begin later this year.Commonwealth Bank call centre employees Jessica Court and Wendy Burton use Trustees Court to smoke during their three daily breaks.'If they ban smoking here, it will be hard for people who work in the call centre - 90 per cent of them smoke,' Ms Burton said.'People from Bakers Dozen come out here to smoke, and lots of people who work in Centreway Arcade, and a lot of young people who get off the bus around the corner.'If it's a no-smoking area, where will all those people smoke? They'll have to go out on the street where all the people are. At least it's sheltered here.'The pair estimated more than 100 smokers used the court at different times of the day.The public toilet development, which was approved at the council's Monday meeting, will replace the existing men's public toilet near Tasmanian Perpetual Trustees.The new $125,000 building will contain seven unisex toilets with disabled access and a $25,000 roofed, paved seating area will be constructed outside the toilets.
