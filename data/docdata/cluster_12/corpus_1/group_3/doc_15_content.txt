SAN DIEGO -- An insurance company will pay San Diego $1.625 million to settle a claim brought by the city to recover lost revenues from a Chargers game that was canceled as a result of the 2003 wildfires, City Attorney Michael Aguirre announced Tuesday.The city determined the Oct. 27, 2003, Monday Night Football game between the San Diego Chargers and Miami Dolphins could not be played at Qualcomm Stadium because of ash and smoke, so the game was moved to Arizona.As a result, the city missed out on about $500,000 from its cut of stadium sales, taxes and other revenues, Aguirre said.  After the fires, the city filed a claim with its insurer, Lexington Insurance Co., a subsidiary of AIG, seeking to recover some of the money, Aguirre said.The claim was denied, so Aguirre, with the help of consumer attorney Harvey Levine, sued Lexington Insurance in 2006 in a bid to recover the money.Lexington Insurance recently agreed to pay the city $1.625 million to settle the lawsuit. Levine will get about $400,000 of the settlement in attorney's fees, according to Aguirre.
