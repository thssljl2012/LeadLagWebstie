The Village of Fredonia is feeling the effects of the countrys economic flux, officials said during Mondays Village Board meeting. Because of the current reported instability of the villages bonding agent, XL Capital Insurance Co., the villages AAA bond rating has been reduced to B-2. Mayor Michael Sullivan said the village has done nothing to create this situation but is being punished for the weaknesses in the financial markets. Village Administrator Rick St. George said he is working with the local M&amp;amp;T Bank to arrange a procedure to secure 1- year bond anticipation notes for the village when needed.
