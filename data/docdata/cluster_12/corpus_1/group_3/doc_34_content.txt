A consultancy which helps busi-nesses make their websites and particularly their online shopping services more usable and therefore more profitable has acquired a competitor in a move designed to strengthen both firms.Foolproof, one of the UK's leading user experience consultancies, has acquired Usability by Design in what has been described as the first signs of consolidation in the niche market.Foolproof is a Norwich-based business with a second office in London, while the business it is has bought is based in London. Both firms use hi-tech equipment to examine closely the experiences of shoppers when using various online communications - and advise their clients how to improve their offering to boost sales.The purchase will cause no redundancies.Usability by Design's founder, Graham Uff, and its user experience director, Sean Smith, will take senior roles at Foolproof.The entire business will operate under the Foolproof brand.Peter Ballard, founding partner at Foolproof, said: Usability by Design were one of the pioneers of user experience in the UK.Graham and Sean bring with them a wealth of experience to the Foolproof team, as well as some fantastic blue chip clients.The user experience industry is still showing strong growth and it can be hard to build your business organically because of the shortage of experienced people.This acquisition will be seen as one of the first signs of consolidation in the industry and has enabled us to add senior practitioners to our team, strengthen our offering and positioning in the market and establish a robust platform for our continued success.Mr Uff said: The acquisition by Foolproof made perfect sense to us. It secured our ability to continue delivering the quality of service that our existing clients expect, whilst joining a company that is leading the way in developing user experience as a strategic discipline.Sean and I are delighted to be able to bring our own experience to the Foolproof team to grow its presence both here in the UK and internationally.Usability by Design's clients include the John Lewis Partnership, Waitrose, Avis, Reed Business Information, Ebookers and the RSPB.Foolproof's clients include HSBC, Aviva, Lloyds TSB, Thomson, Center Parcs and RBS.Foolproof was named earlier this year by clients as the UK's number one supplier of usability services in an industry survey.
