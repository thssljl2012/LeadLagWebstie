A division of KBS Cos. of Newport Beach, Calif., bought Five Tower for about $73 million, or around $327 a square foot, keeping the price per square foot for sales in that office market on the rise. CB Richard Ellis handled the transaction.The highest trade was in 2005 when BPG Properties sold 300 Four Falls, which is 290,000 square feet, for a rich $100 million price tag, or $340 a square foot.Though the sale of Five Tower didnt set any records, its not a bad showing for this market where money is tight and getting deals closed difficult. A partnership involving Oliver Tyrone Pulver; Cornerstone Real Estate Advisors, which is a subsidiary of MassMutual; and Brandywine Realty Trust put the building up for sale in May. The eight-story, 223,000-square-foot structure at 300 Barr Harbor Drive in West Conshohocken was completed in 2002; its about 98 percent leased up.Keystone Foods, the largest supplier beef and chicken to McDonalds, is one of the lead tenants, at 35,000 square feet; Nationwide Insurance takes a 27,000-square-oot floor; British Technology Group and Eli Lilly and Co. also each occupy floors and the Lenfest family-related entities also have space in the building.Eight Tower across the bridge in Conshohocken has its own story.A joint venture among Pulver, Brandywine and Apollo Real Estate Advisors Value Enhancement Fund broke ground on the 16-story, 345,000-square-foot building at the same time that the tech bubble burst in early 2001. The building was vacant for nearly two years; by the end of 2003 it was 35 percent occupied. The office market gradually rebounded and the building is 92 percent leased up.The property, which overlooks the bridge connecting Conshohocken to West Conshohocken, also includes a 1,100-vehicle garage. An estimate put a sale price at around $100 million. CB Richard Ellis is marketing this building, too.
