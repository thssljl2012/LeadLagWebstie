'Since the Board appointed me to the CEO role three months ago, I have refined Ikanos' priorities, realigned our resources to better serve our customers, and have begun to improve the way we define our new products to address broader markets. These changes will help us build upon our leadership position in designing and developing products that enable advanced broadband services in the digital home.' In addition, Ikanos announced that it has retained the investment banking firm Barclays Capital as its financial advisor to assist it in exploring and evaluating strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.
