The guarantee pledged by the Government today applies to six lenders - four banks and two building societies.The move comes ten days after the Government increased the statutory limit for the deposit guarantee scheme for banks and building societies from 20,000 to 100,000 per depositor. Today's move sets no limit to the funds guaranteed at the six named lenders. The guarantee expires in September 2010: The banks and building societies covered are: Allied Irish Bank Bank of Ireland Anglo Irish Bank Irish Life and Permanent (Permanent TSB) Irish Nationwide Building Society Educational Building Society The guarantee also extends to subsidiaries of these banks and building societies. Other financial institutions, many of which are owned by foreign institutions, are not covered under the new scheme. However, they can avail of the Governments previous Deposit Protection Scheme on sums up to 100,000 but the foreign-owned bank must make a request to the Financial Regulator to be covered to this amount. For example, NIB has applied to increase its coverage to this amount, while Rabo has not beacuse they feel their parent is financially strong enough. They are: National Irish Bank, which is owned by Danish bank Danske ACC and Rabodirect, which are owned by Dutch bank Rabobank Ulster Bank and First Active, which are owned by Royal Bank of Scotland Bank of Scotland (Ireland) and Halifax, which are owned by Lloyds TSB/HBOS IIB Bank, which is owned by Belgian bank KBC Credit Unions Postbank, which is jointly owned by An Post and Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis - Simon Carswell and anna  Caolla
