The company behind a failed $1 billion project to build a golf course and 2,600 housing units in the Meadowlands offered a plan it hopes will keep claim holders at bay by finishing landfill cleanup and prepping the property for sale.The East Rutherford-based company, EnCap Golf Holdings, filed a reorganization plan in a Newark federal court late Tuesday, the deadline imposed by a bankruptcy court judge.EnCap filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in May after the state killed the project, which had become bogged down by delays, environmental violations and cost overruns, according to court records.In June, Wachovia and other banks that hold mortgages on EnCap's 785-acre Meadowlands property asked the judge to dismiss the company's bid for bankruptcy protection as a 'bad faith' filing. But earlier this month, Judge Novalyn Winfield ruled EnCap's court protection would continue through Sept. 30, the deadline for the company to come up with a plan to pay its creditors.In a reorganization plan and disclosure statement that totaled about 200 pages, EnCap urged claim holders to consider a proposal that, it said, would maximize investors' assets by remediating the contaminated site.'EnCap's ability to realize proceeds from sales of all or portions of the Site to developers is conditioned upon its completion of the remediation of the Site,' EnCap manager James F. Dausch wrote in the disclosure statement.If EnCap's plan were rejected, years of costly, taxpayer-financed litigation could follow, the company warned.Private stakeholders also could face tremendous risk, an attorney for the company's bankruptcy case said. Wachovia Bank is owed $155 million on the project and the insurance company AIG has an exposure of $148 million on a performance bond, the attorney, Michael Sirota, said.'I think that if the stakeholders separate the history and emotion and get down to the decision of what's good for the state and what's good for the stakeholders, this plan makes abundant sense and should be endorsed,' Sirota said. 'And EnCap has made no demands in exchange .., including any continuing interest in the project.'Among EnCap's unsecured creditors, Lyndhurst is owed nearly $4 million and Rutherford is owed $640,000. EnCap owes its general contractor, Mactec, $15.8 million.CONTINUED 1   2 Next
