The insurer American International Group said Friday it plans to sell off a number of business units to pay off its massive government loan.On the brink of failure last month, AIG was bailed out when the government offered it an $85 billion loan during the ongoing credit crisis that saw Lehman Brothers Holdings file for bankruptcy protection and Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. sold to Bank of America. In return for the loan, the government received warrants to purchase up to 79.9 percent of AIG.Shortly after the deal, newly appointed Chairman and Chief Executive Edward Liddy said he planned to quickly raise funds through asset sales but hoped to hold on to as many of AIG's insurance operations as possible.- THE ASSOCIATED PRESSGM launches Traverse crossoverGeneral Motors Corp. on Friday officially launched full-scale production of the its new Chevrolet Traverse at its overhauled former Saturn plant on the outskirts of Nashville.Troy A. Clarke, president of GM North America, said the eight-seat crossover will appeal to drivers of large SUVs and trucks seeking better fuel economy.'This is a vehicle that's got the interior space or utility of a Chevrolet Tahoe, but a much better fuel economy and a much tighter exterior package,' Clarke told reporters after a launch ceremony at the plant.Clarke said the Traverse is poised to take advantage of a downsizing trend among consumers. Drivers tend to want to move down to smaller vehicles in increments, so most are not likely to want to skip from a larger SUV to a small car, he said.- THE ASSOCIATED PRESSHistoric hotel to reopen in 2009A historic New Orleans hotel shuttered since Hurricane Katrina will reopen in late spring 2009 with a $135 million renovation, project backers said Friday.The former Fairmont Hotel will again be known as The Roosevelt and will have 505 rooms, including 125 luxury suites, dining and drinking venues, entertainment space and convention rooms.'Our goal is to return The Roosevelt to its original luster and bring back its fabled splendor,' said Sam Friedman, part of the ownership group First Class Hotels LLC.The hotel will be managed by Hilton Hotels under its Waldorf-Astoria brand.
