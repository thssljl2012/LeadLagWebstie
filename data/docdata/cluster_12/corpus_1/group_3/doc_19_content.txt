 EAST RUTHERFORD The New Jersey Nets' present home could become  a film studio?That's one of the ideas being floated by some Bergen County officials trying to figure out what could be done with the Izod Center in East Rutherford after the Nets move to Brooklyn.The team has pushed the move to the new Barclays Center back to at least 2010.Some local officials  including East Rutherford Mayor James Cassella  are claiming the film studio idea is an underhanded way to get the arena closed to avoid competition with Newark's Prudential Center.But Tom Meyers at the Bergen County Film Commission says the film studio idea is worth a feasibility study.Steven Gorelick at the New Jersey Motion Picture and Television Commission thinks a studio could bring hundreds of part-time and full-time jobs.
