profit growth and low lending losses was over for the banking industry, with the global credit crisis likely to take years to unwind.The comments came as ANZ's full-year profit slumped 23%, after earnings were pummelled by nearly $2 billion in provisions for bad loans and while revenue growth stalled after ANZ was hit by charges linked to complex credit exposures.Despite the "unprecedented" financial crisis,  was likely to avoid slipping into a recession, Mr Smith said. However, there was no way the local economy could avoid the global turmoil, with unemployment tipped to rise and lending growth to slow."We believe it will take two or three years for the world to work through this international crisis and the economic impact that will flow from it," Mr Smith said.For banks this meant being forced to slow the pace of lending to preserve funds while the rate of souring loans particularly among business would rise."In financial markets and banking we're at one of those points in history where the game has changed," Mr Smith said. ANZ yesterday reported a $3.02 billion cash profit for the year to September 30, disappointing investors after earnings fell short of market forecasts, in part due to larger than expected provisioning with the rate of losses quickening in the second half.The earnings drop marked the bank's worst profit performance in nearly two decades and follows   Bank this week posting a 10.7% drop in earnings to $3.9 billion.However, the profit and high capital reserves of ANZ contrast with many large banks in Europe and the US, which continue to suffer savage losses on problems linked to the global credit crunch.But ANZ has been among the hardest hit of the big n banks, as problem corporates have been squeezed by the global liquidity crisis.It has also been caught out lending hundreds of millions of dollars to failed stock lending firms including Opes Prime and Chimaera offshoot Primebrokers. Both have caused legal headaches and spurred a widespread overhaul of its institutional business.Total credit charges of $1.95 billion for the year were up from $522 million for 2007. The latest figure includes $1.13 billion in specific bad loans, extending to an exposure to collapsed US investment bank Lehman Brothers, several commercial property clients and bill payments group Bill Express.Meanwhile, the bank substantially increased its collected provision as it braced for more lending losses in a tougher environment.Analysts said the bank needed to take control of its bad debt expenses."ANZ is a growth story - but it's been about bad debts rather than revenue or capital growth," said Wilson HTM analyst Brett Le Mesurier.ANZ shares dropped 5.2% to $18.01 yesterday.ANZ is also preparing to spend $320 million over two years as part of a top-level restructure aimed at improving efficiencies. About 500 jobs are expected to be lost, although this could be higher.Mr Smith, who was appointed to the bank a year ago, said he would be tougher on costs as the economic environment slowed.Elsewhere, ANZ took a bigger than expected $721 million hit to revenue as a result of tough accounting rules surrounding the bank's holdings of credit derivatives instruments.Mr Smith expressed frustration at the write-downs as they were forced on the bank because of new rules requiring derivative assets to be revised at current market values.This had exaggerated losses despite the underlying instruments remaining healthy, Mr Smith said.Excluding the impact of the credit impairment charge, ANZ's cash earnings would have grown 13%, Mr Smith noted.     : send photos, videos &amp;amp; tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or  us.
