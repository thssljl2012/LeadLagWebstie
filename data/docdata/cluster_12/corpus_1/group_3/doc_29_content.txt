Champion Australian swimmer Grant Hackett said today he would one day like to move into national politics but he has not yet decided which party to join.Hackett, who won gold in two Olympics in his favourite 1500m freestyle event but came home with the silver medal from the Beijing Games, is still considering whether he will swim for one or two more seasons.In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph he said that he would like to move into politics after the career in finance that he plans to commence in coming months.'Certainly, I don't have any qualms about saying I'd love to get into the top echelon of politics because it gives you the opportunity to contribute at the highest level and have the greatest impact,' Hackett said.'I'm a very passionate person and I'm ambitious.'Being a minister -- of course I'd love an opportunity to do something like that and have the ability and talent and skills to be able to contribute at that level. It's a long-term thing.'The 28-year-old, who has accepted a position at Westpac Bank which he intends to start in the next few months, said he was interested in economics, mental health and sports.But he would delay any foray into federal parliament until he has spent a decade in the corporate world, saying he needed more experience before he would be able to contribute fully.'My political persuasion and which party I would actually go to is undecided at this stage,' he told the paper.'I could go either way if I felt that party was to do the best job and worked the best as a team.'AFPWould you like to Comment?Email ID (1):Email ID (2):Email ID (3):Email ID (4):Email ID (5):
