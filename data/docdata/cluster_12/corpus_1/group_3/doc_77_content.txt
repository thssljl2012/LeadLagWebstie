Peter Mandelson will fly to Moscow next week as controversy continues to swirl around his friendship with Russias richest man, Oleg Deripaska. The Business Secretary is to lead a delegation of top British corporate figures and is expected to meet prominent Russian tycoons and Kremlin ministers. He will be the first Cabinet Minister to visit Moscow for more than a year, following a diplomatic freeze between Britain and Russia.  British Embassy officials refused to say whether he will meet Mr Deripaska, who entertained him on his private yacht in Greece during the summer, and with whom he has enjoyed several dinners in recent years. One said it was too early to say whom Lord Mandelson would meet. Diplomats said the Moscow trip, with three days of official meetings, was originally set up for the peers predecessor, John Hutton.

Russia's richest man Deripaska in a sweat to keep empire intact over urgent 1bn debt   Lord Mandelson had agreed to go ahead with it after Gordon Brown appointed him to the post in a shock return to the Cabinet earlier this month. The visit is certain to keep the focus on Lord Mandelsons friendship with a man said by the Wall Street Journal to be under investigation by U.S. and British authorities over a  33million wire transfer from one of his companies via Barclays Bank. It comes amid speculation that the FBI may release details of an explosive telephone call between Mr Deripaska and former associate Mikhail Cherney. The content is believed to explain why Mr Deripaska has been refused a U.S. visa. The Daily Mail described last week how Lord Mandelsons former aide, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, gave details of a dinner in Moscow between the peer, Mr Deripaska and financier Nat Rothschild.  He also revealed that Lord Mandelson, the former EU trade commissioner, dined with Mr Deripaska on another occasion, when they argued over Russias entry to the World Trade Organisation and tariffs Moscow was imposing on Finnish timber imports. The peer has denied any conflict of interest between his friendship with Mr Deripaska and decisions he made as an EU commissioner. Lord Mandelsons visit has received an unusually warm welcome from the Russians considering the icy relations between the two countries. There have been clashes over the Alexander Litvinenko polonium murder in London, Moscows refusal to extradite suspect Andrei Lugovoy, a round of diplomatic expulsions, the closure of British Council offices, several business disputes and Britain giving asylum to enemies of premier Vladimir Putin. Yuri Fedotov, Russian ambassador to London, said last night: This is a very important visit and we hope it will open new perspectives in our trade relations. 'It is a demonstration that there is a very clear intention on both sides to have good business-to-business relations despite misunderstandings in other, political, areas. If we cannot agree on certain things, we should put them in square brackets and avoid a situation where other areas  like trade or cultural relations  are held hostage. Privately, Kremlin officials are grateful for Lord Mandelsons measured response to the Russian invasion of Georgia in August, when he argued against economic sanctions on Moscow.No comments have so far been submitted.
