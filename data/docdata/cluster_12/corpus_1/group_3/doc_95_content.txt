kbb London will be a CarbonNeutral eventkbb London is set to make history at Earls Court in May 2009 as the first CarbonNeutral exhibition for the kitchen bedroom and bathroom market in the UK.It may even be a world first for this sector and as a CarbonNeutral event, kbb London will be the ideal platform for other environmentally aware companies to showcase their products.'Almost every major company in the KBB sector is doing something to reduce its environmental impact on the planet, such as reducing the energy consumed by appliances during their working lives or the amount of water used in the bathroom', said kbb London event director Paul Sweeney. 'We are part of the KBB market too and wanted to support the efforts of the other companies by providing a carbon neutral exhibition.'Working with TheCarbonNeutral Company whose other clients include worldwide brands such as Honda, Corus, and Barclays, UBM Live will offset the carbon calculated to be produced by kbb London by helping to fund a programme in India which reduces emissions through a waste heat recovery project and is combined with an initiative that promotes an innovative lighting solution for midwives.'Offsetting the carbon produced by kbb London fits in with the ethos of our parent company United Business Media,' explained Sweeney. 'Environmental issues are part of our DNA. In our offices for example we have central waste bins, recycle plastic and paper and have an ongoing policy to reduce printing from computers. The Earls Court venue for kbb London has converted its basement into a waste recycling centre, and for some time now we have used cotton rather than PVC banners and recyclable carpets at all of our exhibitions.'Environmental issues will be an important feature of kbb London and we will be providing all of our exhibitors with information that will help them to reduce their carbon footprints as well.'Established in the mid 1990s, The CarbonNeutral Company is the world's leading carbon consulting and carbon offsetting company. It uses its experience to help corporate clients and individuals to reduce CO2 in a way that delivers commercial, personal and environmental benefit. In addition to helping UBM calculate the amount of carbon produced by kbb London, it will be providing information that will be available at the event to help other companies reduce its carbon footprints too.FeedbackAccording to research, almost 80% of FTSE companies consider climate change to be a business issue, and seen as a greater priority for companies and government than terrorism or competition from the developing world.How important are carbon neutral issues to your company?
