ANZ customers oppose reductions in branch staffing numbers according to polling undertaken by bank workers union Finsec. ANZ recently announced a review of its branch network and have called for voluntary redundancies from staff.93% of customers polled said they did not support a reduction in frontline staff in ANZ branches. 96% of customers polled said branch staffing cuts would have a negative impact on customer service. Customers we talked to overwhelmingly oppose major reductions in ANZ branch staff numbers. They say staffing cuts could result in decreased customer service and we think the bank needs to listen to that, said Andrew Campbell, Finsec Campaigns Director. ANZ has said it will not be consulting customers during the branch review process. In light of our polling results we call on ANZ to reconsider that position. Customers have expressed very strong concerns about the impact of staff reductions and we believe ANZ customers deserve to have a say in the future of their bank, said Campbell. In a survey of branch staff in ANZ National conducted last year 66% of respondents said existing staffing levels across their team had a negative impact on customer service. Further cuts could worsen the impact of understaffing on customers, said Campbell. The goal of the branch review should be to ensure a strong ANZ branch network that delivers high quality customer service. Earlier this year the bank pledged to increase frontline staff and we call on ANZ to keep that promise to ensure customer service is improved as a result of the branch review, said Campbell. Finsec staff polled ANZ customers leaving branches over the period 1-3 October. 332 customers were polled in total. Polling was conducted in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Dunedin. Customers were asked the following questions:Do you support a reduction in frontline staff? Yes or No.Do you believe a reduction in frontline staff will have a negative impact on customer service? Yes or No
