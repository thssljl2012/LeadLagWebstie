Too little information is available on the operations of the Hindu Credit Union (HCU) for the Government to intervene in the ongoing troubles at the cash-strapped financial institution, which is under a liquidation order, Minister in the Ministry of Finance Mariano Browne says. The Credit Union Members Group (CRMG) had written to Government requesting a cash infusion of $100 million and a loan of $200 million to save the HCU group. But yesterday, Browne said Government could not facilitate this. 'In the absence of any information, and there is a requirement on our part and prudence requires that the court process be followed so we could have full and fair disclosure in terms of what is at risk before any decision is made, and to say and to make any decision at this stage of the game would be very premature,' Browne said during yesterday's post-Cabinet news conference at the Diplomatic Centre, St Ann's. Labour and Small and Micro Enterprise Development Minister Rennie Dumas, who is now reviewing an appeal of the HCU liquidation filed by its president, Harry Harnarine, also told reporters there is a major difference between his role and that of the Government in this matter. 'One is that there is a process laid down in law in which the Minister of Labour has a role as tribunal,' he said. Dumas added that the role of the Government in treating with 'a matter in which some members have asked for relief' is a separate issue. Commissioner for Co-operative Development Charles Mitchell seized control of the HCU on Friday and, under Section 58 of the Co-operative Societies Act Chapter 81:03, ordered that it be wound up. Harnarine planned to counter with a High Court action to prevent Mitchell selling off the HCU's assets, even as a forensic report showed the HCU's accounts in a $487 million deficit. Asked if the Government could not undertake a bailout for the HCU, similar to the multi-billion bailout by the United States Government of insurance giant AIG, Browne said the circumstances of HCU and AIG 'are completely different'. 'AIG is important to the full structure of the American banking sector insofar as it may have issued a number of risk guarantees and, therefore, if AIG were to fail then you would also have a ripple effect throughout the entire banking structure, and on that basis AIG needed to be recused,' said Browne.
