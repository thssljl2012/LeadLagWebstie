Barclays is set to introduce a new loan product to help law firms meet New Year expenses, as firms begin to feel the pinch from the prolonged credit squeeze. The bank, one of the :UKs leading lenders to law firms, is looking at introducing a short-term debt product to help firms struggling with their cashflow to pay their VAT and professional indemnity fees, which are due in January.The news comes as bankers and accountants across the City report substantive measures being taken by law firms of all sizes to boost cashflow as the severe credit crisis impacts on the profession.Measures include making short-term delays to partner distributions to avoid costly borrowing, while others are dipping into overdrafts to meet expenses.Naz Vahid, global market manager for Citi Private Banks law firm group, estimated the bank has seen a 20%-30% increase in overdraft uptake over the last three months, particularly among larger firms, as clients delay paying bills, leaving firms with reduced cashflow.She told Legal Week: Pretty much across the range of law firms, we have seen firms make a call for capital, with firms approaching their bank for increases in capital loans. There has also been a trend for firms not to distribute cash to partners as rapidly.Nick Anthony (pictured), head of the professionals and public sector services team at Barclays Commercial Bank, said: Overdrafts and new loans are more expensive across the board and are likely to remain so in the short and medium term. With what has gone on in the banking sector, the list of suppliers that now meet law firms needs will be reduced, probably at a time when they will need the most help.Separately, several firms have talked to their accountants about the possibility of paying their January tax bills early amid fears over the solvency of their own banks. Before the Government bailout of financial institutions, including major law firm banker Royal Bank of Scotland, they were concerned cash would be safer with the Inland Revenue than sitting in the bank.Baker Tilly head of professional services George Bull commented: We have had a lot of queries about paying tax earlier up until this week and, if you have any concerns whatsoever about your bank, it is a very popular idea.One City managing partner said: Firms do not necessarily have all the cash sitting there waiting. People were very worried about the banking environment and their short-term borrowings, particularly those firms that are heavily indebted.
