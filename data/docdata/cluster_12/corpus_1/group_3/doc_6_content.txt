 More than a third of entrepreneurs do not believe that Britain is a good place to run a business, new research reveals.According to the poll by Orange, 36% of respondents disagreed that the UK is conducive to entrepreneurship, compared to 32% who believed it offers a positive business environment.Released to coincide with Small Business Week, the latest findings from the mobile company's SMS Business Jury also analysed entrepreneurs' attitude towards what drives company success.More than two fifths said a good reputation is key, while over a quarter believed satisfied customers is important. In contrast, 19% of respondents attributed success to achieving high profits. Despite the current economic doom and gloom, 12% of those polled said they were more driven as a result of the downturn with 5% saying they had become more innovative.When it came to the personal qualities of a company founder, drive was seen as the most vital quality. This was followed closely by knowledge and passion. Only 3% said education was key, with 2% citing ruthlessness.Asked to comment on which company sets the gold standard as an example of a successful British businesses, 47% of those surveyed chose Tesco, 13% said Marks and Spencer and 12% cited Dyson. Perhaps unsurprisingly given the recent banking collapse only 1% picked Barclays.Martin Lyne, director of small and medium enterprise at Orange Business, said: 'This is a great insight into the current mindset of Britain's businesses during these difficult economic times. 'It's hugely encouraging to see the value placed on good reputation and customer satisfaction. There is also a great resolve and fighting spirit among the owners and managers of Britain's smaller businesses. 'With the hope of a stronger economy, we can look to put the great back into Britain as a place for running a business.'  BusinessZONE - 15-Oct-2008 Categories: News Story read: 66
