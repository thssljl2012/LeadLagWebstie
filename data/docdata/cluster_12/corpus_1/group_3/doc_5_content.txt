Tower Hamlets Council ,Trafalgar Way ,Wood Wharf ,Mini-Canary Wharf passes outline stageWorld's largest yacht squeaks throughPoplar towers hit the buffers for a second timeONE of Europe's largest building projects was given a unanimous thumbs-up by councillors tonight (Thursday).The 7.98 hectare Wood Wharf project passed the outline stage at Tower Hamlets Council's Strategic Development committee meeting, as representatives lined up in support of the 14-building mixed use scheme.Despite concerns over the future of the historic dockside, councillors voted to approve the ambitious building project to the east of Canary Wharf, which is due to be developed in phases over the next ten to 15 years.Wood Wharf will feature office buildings, 1,668 residential units, a high street, cafes, restaurants, health centres, and a record 153million Section 106 contribution to the local community. The Wood Wharf Partnership - a union of Canary Wharf Group, Ballymore and British Waterways - predict the scheme will provide 25,000 jobs for the area.However, councillors were split down the middle when it came to the prospect of mooring the world's largest yacht in Canary Wharf.Aquiva's revived plans for a 180-cabin hotel have been earmarked as a top Olympic attraction, which will measure 15 metres more than Barclays' HQ at One Churchill Square.But committee chair Shafiqul Haque had to step in to cast the deciding vote after the application for the 170-metre craft became deadlocked at 3-3. Cllr Haque voted in favour of Aquiva's record-breaking craft, despite objections from Meridian Place residents who argued their views would be ruined by a permanent fixture 'the size of a football pitch'.Plans for a residential scheme next to Poplar Dock were less successful, as councillors refused to grant permission for Helix-London for a second time.Trafalgar Way Ltd and McDonalds reduced the number of units in its tower by around 40 to 355 in a bid to gain planning permission at the second attempt. But councillors still believe the development is too dense for its position next to the A13 overlooking the Aspen Way roundabout in Poplar.Board members criticised the high density of family housing which could see up to 200 children on site near a roundabout, and re-iterated concerns about the poor air quality which dogged the first application earlier this year.Cllr Stephanie Eaton said: 'I love the design of this building and would so like to be able to support it. But for me the amendments that have come before us are not sufficient to allay the serious concerns I have about the quality of life of residents living in this property.'For more details on tonight's plannng decisions, log on to www.wharf.co.uk this week or pick up The Wharf on Thursday October 16.
