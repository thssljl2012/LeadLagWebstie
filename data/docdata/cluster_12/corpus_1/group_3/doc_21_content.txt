HOPES that ANZ and Merrill Lynch would pay hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation to former clients of Opes Prime Stockbroking have been dashed after settlement talks with the failed company's liquidators broke down last night.The parties are unlikely to return to mediation again.The banks now face years of complex and expensive litigation in several courts as Opes Prime clients pursue them for shares they lost when the banks seized the clients' share portfolios.Earlier this week, 67 clients, backed by litigation funder IMF, filed a claim in the Federal Court seeking up to $150 million from ANZ.Opes Prime liquidator John Lindholm of Ferrier Hodgson had asked the banks to pay more than $300 million to resolve the creditors' claims, a sum the banks rejected as exorbitant and unrealistic.Mr Lindholm accused ANZ of restructuring its securities lending agreements with Opes Prime just before the broker collapsed  actions he told creditors that had unfairly favoured ANZ and disadvantaged Opes Prime.He also accused Merrill Lynch of rewriting a charge with Opes that was put in place more than a year earlier but never registered.Mr Lindholm had intended to extract a sum that would cover his complaints about these deals plus a sweetener that might resolve damages claims by creditors.'Without a settlement, litigation between the liquidators and the banks is unavoidable.'A spokesman for ANZ said the bank had participated in the mediation 'in good faith with a view to achieving a sensible and commercial settlement to cover all claims'.'But unfortunately it seems that was not able to be achieved.'
