AN award-winning chef is to bring his dining experience to Lytham. Thirty-five jobs are to be created when The Sparling opens at the former Conservative Club later this month.Chef Warrick Dodds and local businessman Michael Botes have joined forces to open the new restaurant and pub on the site which until now has been home to the Hastings Club.It is the second such pub of its kind in the North West after the success of its Barton gastro pub on the A6, near Preston, which opened last year.Work is currently underway to transform the former Conservative Club on Hastings Place into a restaurant, bar and conference centre.Warrick has worked under celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal and has cooked for pop superstar Robbie Williams while he stayed at the award-winning Stanley House hotel in East Lancashire.He said: 'The Sparling brand is all about using the best local produce, cooked to perfection. 'We promise Lytham some great traditional British classics, showcasing everything the region has offer in terms of great food.'Our team will also create the first ever signature Lytham dish. 'Our Barton restaurant has been a great success right from the word go. We have visitors from across the North West including celebrities and household- name footballers.'We're proud of our progress and delighted to have secured such a prest-igious site.'The hard work has already begun to give the people of the Fylde a great dining experience in time for Christmas.'Mr Botes teamed-up with business partner James Allan for their Fylde venture, with funding being secured by Barclays Bank.Mr Botes added: 'People are coming from all over to sample Warrick's cooking  he is certainly developing a fan club!'Even during the current economic slowdown, The Sparling at Barton is packed throughout the week. 'Our formula is quite simple; we want to create a perfect dining experience that encourages cust-omers to come back and tell others about it.'Lytham is a unique town and its residents demand something special from the town's restaurants and bars so we look forward to meeting that challenge.'Some quarters might be surprised to see us investing so much during what are troubled economic times but there is always a demand for quality restaurants.'
