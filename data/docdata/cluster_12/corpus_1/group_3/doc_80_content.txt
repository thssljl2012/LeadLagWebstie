THE West Australian Supreme Court's damning decision against bankers of the Bell Group appears to have strengthened the hand of Opes Prime Stockbroking's liquidator as he considers initiating a huge damages claim against ANZ and Merrill Lynch.A week after ANZ and Merrill Lynch abandoned mediation talks with Opes liquidator, John Lindholm of Ferrier Hodgson, the 2643-page Bell Group decision has boosted the hopes of lawyers managing the numerous Opes Prime cases in courts across the country.Senior lawyers say there are striking similarities between the actions of the banks in the Bell case and the actions of ANZ and Merrill Lynch in the days before Opes collapsed in late March.The WA court found that, in taking charges over Bell assets when the group veered close to collapse in early 1990, its bankers received trust property knowing that this stemmed from breaches of fiduciary duties by Bell directors. Bell directors breached their duties by refinancing the group because the deal exposed other Bell companies to potential losses and bumped aside the claims of non-bank creditors.Mr Lindholm believes ANZ unfairly changed the terms of its share-lending contracts with Opes Prime just before the broker collapsed, bolstering its security when the company was already insolvent.He also argues that Merrill Lynch, realising its own position was in serious jeopardy because its secured charge with Opes had never been registered, hastily redrafted the charge and registered it the day after the company collapsed.Slater &amp;amp; Gordon partner David Andrews, who is preparing a class action on behalf of Opes clients, said he was encouraged by the WA court decision, although he had not analysed the reasons for the decision.'I think the Opes liquidators can take encouragement from this decision,' Mr Andrews said.
