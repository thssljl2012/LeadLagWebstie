Singapore - For electronics and mobile phone producer LG, there was a no better way to contribute to society and enjoy work-life balance at the same time than running with their colleagues at the recent Frost &amp;amp; Sullivan corporate race.Now in its third year, Let's Frost the Race was held last Saturday atNational Parks' HortPark. It saw 43 teams from the likes of NEC, Barclays Capital and Keppel Logistics paying sums of $500 for a team signing up. All proceeds from the race will be donated to PEACE-Connect Neighbourhood Link, which is a neighbourhood link aimed at promoting purposeful community life.Wayne Tang, public relations and corporate marketing manage for LG says the run has enabled the team members, who were all relatively new to the company, to know each other better. 'It was a good opportunity to learn about each other as an individual outside the office environment,' he adds.Foong Leng Lee, senior sales director, APAC for Frost &amp;amp; Sullivan says corporate races such as this one can prove beneficial to team-building. This is also just one of the many team-building exercises which the company does as well, which include dragon-boat lessons, bowling tournaments and street soccer matches. 'These sessions are a great platform for 100-over staff to meet each other and interact outside work and also allows them to bond and catch-up with each other,' Foong adds.While Foong admits that the donation sum may be a little pricey, it did not deter the teams who viewed it as an opportunity to contribute to a charitable cause. 'I am aware of at least 15 teams who took the time to hold regular team training sessions in preparation of this run. Some held practices on Saturday mornings and then enjoyed breakfast together, while others trained on weekday evenings and continued their session by having drinks together. Whichever way, they have all gotten to know each other much better, through this run and through the preparation for it,' she says.
