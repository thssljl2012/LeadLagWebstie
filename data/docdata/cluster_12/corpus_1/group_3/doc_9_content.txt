AS OPES PRIME creditors mull whether to put the failed margin lender into liquidation this week, Opes receivers are in talks with two of the directors responsible for the collapse over the millions they owe the company.One of the receivers appointed by ANZ Bank, Sal Algeri, of Deloitte, said they were close to a settlement with Julian Smith. 'He's co-operating and we're getting an arrangement with him in terms of settling his position,' Mr Algeri said.The receivers have begun proceedings against Laurie Emini but said they had been talking with him and hoped to settle before the matter went to court. Mr Algeri would not say how much the two were estimated to owe, other than to say it was in the millions.The settlement will not affect investigations by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission into the pair, and another director, Anthony Blumberg, who have been prevented from leaving the country while the commission's investigation of the collapse continues.The odd man out is Mr Blumberg, who is being sued for $14 million worth of debts he ran up with Opes before it was put into administration in March.However, the receiver's endeavour may come to nothing. The administrators are recommending that creditors place Opes, and its related companies, into liquidation on Wednesday.The administrators, led by John Lindholm, of Ferrier Hodgson, have said the main claim in liquidation would be to overturn Merrill Lynch's and ANZ's secured charge over Opes assets. Opes was already insolvent when the transaction was made, Mr Lindholm said.Actions in liquidation against ANZ alone could yield $270 million, he said. But creditors also have reason to hold back from putting the company into liquidation.A recent court ruling determined that the accounts of Opes clients were not automatically closed out when administrators were appointed. This means that most clients, now creditors, were still exposed to the huge sharemarket losses since March, which potentially destroys the amounts they are owed by Opes or, in some cases, they may now owe money to the company.The administrators determined last month, before the current sharemarket rout, that as many as 75 per cent of Opes clients would be worse off from the ruling.The receivers said they had also been unable to collect the vast majority of debts owed by Opes clients precisely because most of the accounts had not been closed off.The administrators are expected to provide an update on the mediated settlement, being conducted with the two banks and the securities and investments commission, at the creditors meeting. The administrators say significant progress has been made in the mediation, and the deadline has been extended until next Monday.
