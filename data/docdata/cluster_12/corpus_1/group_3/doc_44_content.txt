The financial crisis that has seen a wave of banking mergers and takeovers has placed a question mark over the future of more than 30 bank branches across Notts.Bradford and Bingley is the latest bank to hit trouble, the Government announcing yesterday that it would be nationalised and its savings business sold off to Spanish banking giant Santander, which owns Abbey.The move comes only days after Alliance and Leicester shareholders voted to allow the troubled bank to be taken over by Santander.And it follows proposals for Halifax Bank of Scotland Group - which is heavily exposed to the troubled housing market - to seek shelter in the arms of Lloyds-TSB.Bradford and Bingley, a former building society which joined the Stock Exchange and became a bank, has 14 branches across Notts in locations ranging from Arnold to Ruddington.Alliance and Leicester, another former building society which de-mutualised to fund expansion, has five branches in major centres like the city, Mansfield and Beeston.HBOS, which trades under the Halifax brand in England, has 12 bank branches in Notts, with three branches in Nottingham alone.This means that more than 30 bank branches will be affected by the merger and takeover deals sweeping the banking market amid the financial crisis.None of the banks has so far indicated what changes the deals might lead to in branch networks.All have said that they will seek to achieve cost savings, though.The meteoric growth of the financial services industry over the past 15 years has played a key part in the expansion of the High Street, with banks occupying a significant number of key premises in the city centre.Property agents say the quality of bank premises could provide strong opportunities for fashion chains and coffee shops looking for extra branches.Ben Tebbutt, a partner with Nottingham property agents Fisher Hargreaves Proctor, said: 'Bank premises tend to be attractive properties in very good locations, and for that reason I suspect they may well prove interesting to fashion chains or coffee shops - even in the current circumstances.'Banks will have to dispose of these properties and they will therefore have to be realistic about the price they accept from developers, who will be looking to build the loss from any vacant period into the deal.'Source: Nottingham Evening Post
