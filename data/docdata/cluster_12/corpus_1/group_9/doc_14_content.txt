Gulf International Bank (GIB), owned by the six GCC states, expects to post a full-year profit after shareholders bailed it out by taking toxic assets off its books, its chief executive said yesterday.  GIB sold toxic asset-backed securities worth $4.8 billion (Dh17.63bn) to its shareholders, including the governments of Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, Yahya Alyahya said, in the latest sign Gulf banks have not avoided global turmoil.  He said the assets, settled on March 27, included exposure to collapsed US bank Lehman Brothers and other international securities severely hit by a global stock market rout.'The fact that we have sold the securities portfolio really saves the bank from any future losses on securities,' Alyahya said. 'The actual amount will depend on exchange rates on day of settlement, it may be slightly less than $4.8bn.'Banks across the oil-exporting Gulf have seen sharp declines in quarterly profits and some have made losses as the credit crisis hits their lending businesses, they book provisions for bad loans and write down investments. One bank hit severely by the global crisis was Kuwait's Gulf Bank, which had to be rescued by the government after posting steep losses related to trading in derivatives.  Bahrain-headquartered GIB, with assets of $25bn, posted combined losses of $1.15bn in 2007 and 2008.'Going forward, I expect 2009 to end with a positive net profit,' Alyahya said, declining to be more specific.  The Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (Sama) owns 37.6 per cent of GIB, while the Saudi government holds 16.5 per cent.  Bahrain, Oman and UAE own 7.2 per cent each, while Kuwait and Qatar each hold 12.1 per cent of the bank.  Yahya said GIB's customer deposits have increased by about 10 per cent since it announced the sale of the assets last week.'We are able to get more funding from markets and clients, and are able to get funding at lower margins,' he added.As a wholesale bank, GIB's funding depends on the interbank lending market, where borrowing costs spiralled as global credit markets tightened late last year.
