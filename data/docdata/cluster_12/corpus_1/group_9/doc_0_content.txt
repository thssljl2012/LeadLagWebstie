The Finance Sector Union (FSU) says Bankwest staff are considering a strike to protest against job cuts.  The bank, which was taken over by the Commonwealth bank last year, has announced it will slash 400 jobs, but will not reveal which staff will go until next week.  The FSU has sent a resolution to the bank calling for it to consider voluntary redundancies and increased severance packages.  A spokeswoman for the FSU, Di Marshall, says that resolution has been rejected, and members are now considering industrial action. 'As a union we're not ruling out any anything that they decide as responsible and appropriate action,' she said. The FSU has accused the west Australian Premier of abandoning Bankwest employees facing redundancy.  Earlier this week, the West Australian Premier, Colin Barnett, said he was disappointed, but that the situation could have been a lot worse.  Ms Marshall says Mr Barnett should fight for West Australian jobs. 'They're feeling totally abandoned by the Premier,' she said. 'It is his role to support all employees in this state and there's no indication that he's even listening, let alone supporting them.'
