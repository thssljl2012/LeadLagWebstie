The Stevedoring Employees' Retirement Fund (SERF) and the Seafarers Retirement Fund (SRF) officially merged to create a $2.6 billion Maritime Super this month.  Former SERF chief executive and now Maritime Super chief executive, Peter Robertson, said merging both funds would provide more services to members at a lower cost.  'There's now a much greater resource to provide financial planning advice, enhance our delivery for members both face to face, online and on the telephone. The key focus is keeping costs down across the services we offer to all member,' he said.  The fund now offers five different investment options to members; growth, balanced, conservative, cash enhanced and cash. Prior to the merger, SERF had three options and SRF had four options and those investment options were aligned on 1 January.  In terms of insurance, Robertson said the fund did not have a sole insurance provider just yet. SRF went through an insurance tender shortly and chose AIG Life as the fund's insurer before the merger and SERF was self insured prior to the merger.  'Given members have been covered we haven't focused on insurance at this time that is on the agenda at this time,' he said.  Maritime Super has outsourced it financial planning service to Industry Funds Financial Planning (IFFP).
