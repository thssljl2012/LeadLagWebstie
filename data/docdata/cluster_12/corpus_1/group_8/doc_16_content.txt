United Stationers has reached a new $150 million securitisation agreement with a group of lenders, replacing a similar $250 million financing accord that was set to expire 20 March.  In SEC filings, United said it had agreed to sell all its customer accounts receivable, on an ongoing basis and at a small discount, to a consortium that comprises entities of Bank of America and PNC Bank.  Combined with other funding sources, (including a $625 million bank credit facility expiring in 2012) the company said, the new facility provides the wholesaler with around $900 million in committed debt capacity.
