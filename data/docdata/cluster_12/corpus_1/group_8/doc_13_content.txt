Barclays shares jumped by a fifth yesterday on growing hopes that it can avoid partial nationalisation.  The company said it had held talks on the sale of its iShares business, which could raise up to 4billion to strengthen its finances, and gave an upbeat assessment of trading since the start of the year.  Barclays became the latest in a growing list of major banks to sound a note of optimism, following similar statements from US rivals Citigroup, Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase. It said its businesses continue to perform well and have had a strong start to 2009. Confirming speculation that it was considering selling iShares, part of its investment banking arm, the company said it had held talks with a number of potentially interested parties as part of its practice of regularly reviewing the groups portfolio. It stressed that no decision regarding the disposal of any business had been taken by the board, but the City thinks iShares could attract keen interest from potential buyers.  The disposal would give Barclays, headed by chairman Marcus Agius and chief executive John Varley, increased flexibility as they hold talks with the Treasury and the Financial Services Authority about joining the Governments asset protection scheme.
