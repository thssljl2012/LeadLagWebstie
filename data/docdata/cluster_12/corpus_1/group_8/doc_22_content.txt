SYDNEY -(Dow Jones)- Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ.AU) Chief Executive   Mike Smith  said speculation that it in discussions with Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.LN) about making a bid for its Asian assets is premature. 'I don't think (RBS has) actually given out any information memorandum, so I think it's all preemptive,' Smith told reporters when asked about reports that ANZ has hired outside advisers to help it fashion a bid for the RBS assets.   -By   Ross Kelly  , Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-8235-2957; ross.kelly@dowjones.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires 03-01-092058ET Copyright (c) 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
