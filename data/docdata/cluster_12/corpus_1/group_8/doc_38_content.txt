 2:03 pm  Golden handshakes for corporate high-flyers are in the Federal Government's sights, as it moves to hand shareholders more power over executive termination payments.  The Productivity Commission will also hold an inquiry into the issue of executive pay.  Under the current laws, executives can be paid up to seven times their annual remuneration package before the payout needs shareholder approval.  But federal Treasurer Wayne Swan says the Government will amend the Corporations Act so that shareholders will have to approve any payout which exceeds one year's base salary. 'I think the community has been rightly offended by some excessive payments and this is an important initiative and the Government will legislate to this effect,' he said. The Government will also legislate to extend the range of executives whose termination payments can be subject to shareholder approval and broaden the definition of 'termination benefit' to catch all types of payment and rewards given at termination.  The reforms will not prevent existing contracts on termination payments from proceeding.  The Australian moves come as the US congress examines legal options to force insurance giant AIG to return $250 million worth of executive bonuses.  Mr Swan and Superannuation Minister Nick Sherry announced the reforms, also saying that former ACCC chairman  will be an associate commissioner to the Productivity Commission.  The Productivity Commission will look at the relationship between company performance and how much its senior managers are paid.  Commission chairman Gary Banks will preside over the examination, along with commissioner Robert Fitzgerald.   The Government says the inquiry will also examine international trends and responses to the problems of excessive risk taking and corporate greed.  The Productivity Commission is required to provide a final report within nine months.
