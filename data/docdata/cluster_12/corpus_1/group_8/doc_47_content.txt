United Stationers Inc. said it reached a new, $150 million securitization agreement with a group of lenders, replacing a similar $250 million financing accord that was set to expire March 20.  In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Deerfield business-products distributor said it had agreed to sell all its customer accounts receivable, on an ongoing basis and at a slight discount, to a group that includes entities of Bank of America and PNC Bank.  Combined with other funding sources, (including a $625 million bank credit facility that expires in 2012) United Stationers said, the new facility provides the distribution concern with about $900 million in committed debt capacity. The company 'continues to have access to attractive funding sources,' said Chief Financial Officer Victoria J. Reich.
