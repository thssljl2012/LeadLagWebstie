Merchant cooperative Unimer is introducing Key Account Managers and internal account management to create tailored solutions for individual merchant members and the buying groups operating in the UK and Ireland. This new structure aims to provide a more comprehensive service offering to ensure members achieve the most out of their Unimer membership. Suzanne Millward, Unimer marketing manager, will, in addition to her marketing responsibilities, take over the responsibility for a number of geographical key accounts in the South East and will also manage the CBA (Central Buying Association) as a Key Account. Ian Young and Mark Rynhoud have both been promoted to Key Account Managers and will manage Unimer's strategic accounts in the North and South respectively. Young has been with Unimer for 10 years, and will now also manage the relationship with NBG (National Buying Group). Rynhoud, who is currently covering the South East, will assume the responsibilities of managing the H&amp;B buying group. The new team's key objective is to further develop relationships with members and enhance the opportunities in the marketplace.
