NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)-  (CAG) said it lowered prices in some segments like cooking oil to compete better with private label products, but said it expects its overall volumes to improve sequentially as it works to re-energize some of its brands.  On a conference call, the company's executives said they expect inflation to moderate significantly in the fourth quarter.  Separately, ConAgra said it is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims related to its February 2007 peanut butter recall.  The company said it does have an insurance policy with Lexington Insurance Co, a subsidiary of  (AIG), that ConAgra believes covers a very large part of the associated losses. However, during the third quarter a coverage dispute developed with the carrier and ConAgra initiated litigation to enforce the policy.  As a result of this dispute, the company has taken a pre-tax charge of $25 million, or 3 cents a share.  -Anjali Cordeiro; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2408; anjali.cordeiro@ dowjones.com   (END) Dow Jones Newswires 03-26-091120ET Copyright (c) 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
