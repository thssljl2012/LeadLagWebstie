 NAB - which is poised to slash jobs and is the only major bank to impose a disloyalty charge for using a 'foreign' ATM - is refusing to budge.   Furious Westpac and St George customers hit with the unpopular fee since Tuesday will be refunded, after a senior executive admitted it was unfair.   The victory comes as Australian banks are forecast to grab more than $5 billion in fees this year.   Westpac's group executive of retail banking, Peter Hanlon, advised staff of the change of heart in a message yesterday. 'Many of you have had the feedback from customers, friends and family regarding the unfairness of this fee. As a result we have reviewed our position,' Mr Hanlon said. However, the NAB and Bankwest stood firm on their 50c charge for customers withdrawing money from machines outside their network.   NAB spokesman Andrew Wheaton said: 'Our fees are under constant review to ensure they remain competitive at all times'. New rules introduced this week allow consumers to be slugged twice - first by their own bank for using a 'foreign' ATM, and by the owner of the rival machine.   The charge by the machine owner is typically $2 and must be disclosed before the transaction.   Consumer groups have accused banks levying 'foreign' ATM fees on their own customers of double dipping.   Prime Minister Kevin Rudd attacked unjustified costs, saying: 'Businesses, households - everyone - is facing a really tough time and we don't want to see anyone adding to that burden by unnecessary charges.' A recent Fujitsu Consulting report found Australians endured the most expensive bank fees in the Western world because of a lack of competition. But the  claims the charges are mid-range compared to those in other countries.
