Hardwoods Distribution Income Fund (the 'Fund') today announced that one of its largest customers, Monaco Coach Corporation ('Monaco'), had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States. Monaco's bankruptcy filing caused the Fund to reevaluate the expected recoverability of accounts receivable owing from Monaco, and to reassess the market value of specialized inventory specifically held to service the requirements of this long term customer.   As a result of this process, the Fund determined that an additional allowance for doubtful accounts, and a write-down in the carrying value of inventory, was warranted. The Fund estimates a charge to earnings of Cdn$1.8 million will be recorded in the Fund's fourth quarter of 2008 related to this matter. After reflecting this additional charge to earnings, the Fund's US operating subsidiary would no longer be in compliance with the financial covenant contained in its US credit agreement, which requires the US subsidiary to maintain a certain fixed charge coverage ratio. However, the US subsidiary has been advised by its US lender that the lender will waive the writedowns associated with the Monaco bankruptcy when calculating the fixed charge coverage ratio, which is expected to result in the US subsidiary remaining in compliance with its financial covenant. 'It is unfortunate that the challenging economic climate in the United States has caused one of our long term customers to cease operations and seek bankruptcy protection', commented Maurice Paquette, President and Chief Executive Officer. 'Market conditions remain very difficult for our customers, and this elevates our credit risk. Although Monaco is just one of our approximately 2000 active accounts, they were one of our largest customers, comprising approximately 3.4% of the Fund's annual sales in 2008. We notified our lender of an anticipated covenant default, and are pleased that they have agreed to work closely with us to resolve this matter,' said Paquette. The Fund's 2008 fourth quarter financial results are scheduled to be released after market close on March 25, 2009.
