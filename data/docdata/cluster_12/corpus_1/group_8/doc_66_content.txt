The New Albany-based truck parts manufacturer said it paid about $400,000 to amend a $47.5 million credit facility it created with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) in January. The amendment eliminates a first-quarter operating performance covenant and changes performance requirements for the year.  The credit facility itself had replaced a previous $50 million agreement that had put compliance pressure on the company.  Spokesman John Hyre declined to speculate on whether the company would have fallen out of compliance had it not amended the facility, but said the move gives Commercial Vehicle (NASDAQ:CVGI) much-needed room to breathe.  In the two months since the company signed on for the facility, it has launched a $10 million cost-cutting plan that includes plant closures and job cuts. Commercial Vehicles top executives also took a voluntary pay cut. (The amended facility) gives us cushion, based on the continuing deterioration in the economy and the impact its had on our end markets, which are construction ... and Class-A North American trucks, he said. Its something were comfortable with. The amendment also limits capital expenditures through the first half of the year at $4.3 million and $9.7 million for the year.  Commercial Vehicle hasnt filed final fourth-quarter and full-year financial data with the Securities and Exchange Commission but a preliminary report to investors last month said revenue last year was up 10 percent at $764.5 million while operating income fell 14 percent to $16.1 million. The companys bottom line likely will swing to a loss, however, as it writes down most or all of its $230 million in goodwill and intangible assets as of the end of 2008.  The company, which makes and supplies interiors and other systems for trucks and buses, lost $3.3 million on $696.8 million in revenue in 2007.
