MOSCOW, March 11 (Reuters) - Russian petrochemicals firm Sibur is seeking more than $2 billion from Russian state bank VEB and Western banks and has repaid a $200 million loan ahead of schedule, the firm said on Wednesday.  Sibur will use the fresh credits for new projects, including developing a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plant and a polymers plant, its strategy director Sergei Komyshan told reporters.  In March the firm paid off early its $200 million syndicated loan, organised by the London branches of ABN AMRO and Citibank, which was due this August.
