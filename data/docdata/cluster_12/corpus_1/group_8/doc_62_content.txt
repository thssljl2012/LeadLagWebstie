Australia's big banks are expanding or looking to extend hardship policies for borrowers by offering home loan repayment 'holidays' to those who lose their jobs during the economic downturn. Australia's   Ltd (CBA) on Wednesday flagged a 'blanket offer for those who experience unemployment' as part of its existing policy.  Chief executive Ralph Norris said the scheme would have been announced earlier if the Victorian bushfires and the floods in Queensland in February had not overwhelmed customer assistance staff.  The bank would impose no form of disqualification and was willing to have discussions with any mortgage customer who had lost their job.  Mr Norris rejected suggestions the bank introduced the scheme after getting a nudge from the federal government. 'This is very much the bank's idea. It goes back to a decision we took some six weeks ago,' he told ABC Radio. CBA said the policy was driven by the unprecedented nature of the global economic downturn, which is expected to lift Australia's unemployment rate to seven per cent by mid-2010, from a current 5.2 per cent. 'We wanted to work with any of our customers who become unemployed, and so we're offering them the opportunity to have a six month and up to twelve month repayment holiday on their home loan,' a spokesman told AAP.  Interest on the loan would still capitalise, and repayments recommence as normal at the end of the moratorium period.  The term of the loan would also be extended by the length of the repayment freeze.  ANZ Banking Group Ltd said it was looking at a similar offer, on top of its existing mortgage repayment deferral for customers experiencing hardship. 'We're looking at how we extend and formalise those and we certainly hope to be in a position in the near future to announce an extended hardship package, particularly for those who face unemployment,' an ANZ spokesman said.  Westpac said it had offered a range of measures to customers who encounter financial troubles for many years, including repayment holidays. 'Ours is on a case by case basis, and its been in place for over 10 years,' A Westpac spokesman told AAP. 'We always continue to review (those measures), I know we're increasing the number of specialists we have in that area. 'We're always looking at enhancing it.' Westpac said the federal government was well aware of its measures offered to customers experiencing financial pressure. 'We've had a dialogue with the government over a long period of time on how we're dealing with financial hardship,' the spokesman said.  National Australia Bank said it offered repayment holidays in hardship cases on a case-by-case basis.
