MOSCOW, March 11 (Reuters) - Russian petrochemicals firm Sibur said on Wednesday is seeking more than $2 billion from Russian state bank VEB and western banks, and has repaid its $200 million loan ahead of schedule.   If the deal goes through it would be the second major Western loan to a Russian firm since the credit crunch shut Russian borrowers' access to international capital markets late last year. The only deal on record so far is oil firm Rosneft's $1.35 billion pre-export loan.   Sibur will use the fresh credit for new projects, including developing its polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plant and a polymers plant, strategy director Sergei Komyshan told reporters.   'We've received comforting letters from export agencies that support financing, but there are still no guarantees,' Komyshan said, adding that ecological tests might need to be done first before the firm received any credit.   VEB would lend money and help organise loans with Western banks after obtaining guarantees from international export agencies Hermes and others, he said.   Sibur is controlled by Gazprombank, the banking arm of Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom.   The company said it needed to spend $1.441 billion to bring its polymers plant in Tobolsk in western Siberia onstream in 2012. It will have a capacity of 500,000 tonnes a year.   It also plans to spend 564 million euros to build a 330,000 tonne per year PVC plant in Kstovo on the Volga river in central Russia.   Sibur is asking VEB to provide a quarter of the credit needed for the polymers plant in Tobolsk and 60 percent for the PVC plant in Kstovo.   The firm has already used 10 billion roubles ($284.8 million) of its own funds on the two plants -- about 10 percent of the total cost -- from its own funds.   Sibur also said it paid off its $200 million syndicated loan this month, organised by the London branches of ABN AMRO and Citibank. It had been due in August 2009.
