RIVERSIDE, Calif., March 10 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Fleetwood Enterprises, Inc. (OTC Bulletin Board: FLTW) ('Fleetwood'), a leading producer of recreational vehicles and manufactured housing, today filed voluntary Chapter 11 petitions for itself and certain operating subsidiaries in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District ofCalifornia inRiverside. The filings do not include any of the company's foreign or non-operating entities.   Fleetwood's motor home and manufactured housing businesses will continue to operate while the company seeks buyers for these business units. While Fleetwood believes it has sufficient cash to operate its businesses in the immediate term, the company is also in advanced discussions with its senior secured lenders for new, debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing to supplement existing working capital. As of Jan. 25, 2009, the company had bank cash of approximately $23.0 million  Filing at this time preserves Fleetwood's right to revisit its Dec. 12, 2008 Exchange Offer, in which the company issued its 14% senior secured notes. Under Chapter 11, the company has a 90-day period from the Offer's effective date in which to revisit the terms; that period will expire shortly. Terms of the senior notes effectively restricted the company from seeking investment in its businesses in view of subsequent deterioration in the market.   The filing also facilitates the closing of Fleetwood's travel trailer division, which the company has commenced. This division accounted for losses of $65.3 million 'Although we made substantial progress in restructuring this division and improved the product offering, current market conditions proved too severe to continue the turnaround,' stated Elden L. Smith  Today's events follow three years of restructuring that management undertook in the face of worsening market conditions and, more recently, unprecedented credit restrictions affecting both dealers and customers. Management's actions included selling two non-core businesses, restructuring and decentralizing operations, reducing headcount company-wide by more than 70%, and adding new distribution points and a modular division. Despite these efforts, however, management determined that a Court reorganization would offer the best means of addressing the company's existing debt structure and ongoing losses in travel trailers, which cannot be supported in the current economy. 'We will use the Chapter 11 process to more rapidly restructure our overhead, pursue potential buyers, and definitively resolve our debt issues,' Mr. Smith said. 'Fleetwood is one of the most widely recognized names in our industries, with strong market share, an extensive dealer network and enthusiastic customer support. As important as these assets are, we must take additional steps in response to today's deepening economic challenges. 'We appreciate the support of our loyal dealers and customers. We want to assure them that we intend to continue doing business in motor homes and manufactured housing while we complete the processes before us. We will work with our dealers to support the continued sales of Fleetwood motor homes and manufactured homes.' Mr. Smith went on to say that 'The RV industry has sound long-term prospects, as RVers remain faithful to the lifestyle, and we anticipate a strong rebound when the financing environment stabilizes and consumer confidence improves. In our manufactured housing business, we see growth opportunities that arise from positive demographic trends, the growing need for affordable housing in this country, and commercial modular applications, particularly for the military which represents an important segment of our market. We will be able to compete more effectively now that financing advantages of site-built homes over manufactured homes have narrowed. We are taking steps to ensure our businesses will be ready when the current markets turn up again.' Fleetwood has filed first-day motions that ask the Court to approve, among other things, payment of employee wage and benefit charges that were incurred before the petition was filed, and the continuation of certain sales incentive programs, warranty service, cash collateral, and cash management systems. The company is working with its largest national lender, Bank of America, to continue to provide competitive RV dealer and consumer financing during the reorganization period. 'The vast majority of our suppliers and dealers should see no disruption in our business,' Mr. Smith emphasized. 'We will continue to support our current and future product development and manufacturing.' The company's consolidated balance sheet as of Oct. 26. 2008, showed assets of $558.3 million  The company expects to incorporate the impact of the filing on its fiscal third quarter results and file its Form 10Q as soon as it is completed.
