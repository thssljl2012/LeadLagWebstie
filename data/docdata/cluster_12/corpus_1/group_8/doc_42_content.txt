CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- There is new hope for job seekers this morning, especially those who have been laid off from companies like Bank of America and Wachovia.   Some financial services in the Charlotte area will start hiring again very soon.   One groups say primarily jobs in the accounting and financial areas should see some gains in the next quarter.   Robert Half International does a hiring survey every three months on a national basis with 30 or markets. Charlotte is one of those markets.   The group independently surveys about 200 CFOs from large and smaller companies about their hiring trends. The Queen City fared better than most areas in hiring for accounting and finance professionals positions. 'As companies have contracted and realized that their staff may be smaller than they like, they've been looking at the idea of possibly bringing in more talent, said Michael Steinitz, Robert Half International. And it's actually a really good time to improve your talent pool and make sure you have the best people on your staff.' Their research shows that while some companies still plan reductions, other companies will add staff. An overall net increase of one percent is expected, which is up seven points from last quarter.
