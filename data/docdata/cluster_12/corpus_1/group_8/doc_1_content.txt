AUSTRALIA'S $21 billion margin-lending industry is set for a major regulatory and legislative overhaul in the next few months.  The move comes with the industry being fingered as one of the main destroyers of investor wealth during the past 18 months.  Between June last year and December 30, the number of margin calls received by the 205,000 Australians with margin loans increased 458 per cent, as the share market dropped 40 per cent.   The Reserve Bank's March quarter figures on margin lending are yet to be released but Simon Bond from ABN AMRO Morgans suggests this figure could deteriorate significantly following the drop in the equities market and the fact that many stocks that previously had a high leveraged ratio such as Macquarie Group, Fairfax and Pacific Brands, have seen their share price battered in the past few weeks.   It is no surprise that the market is behaving erratically. Investor sentiment is down because of concerns about the global credit market crisis, fears of a recession in Australia and excessive leverage. There is at least $64billion in outstanding margin-lending accounts along with other leveraged products such as CFDs.   It is not being helped by headlines such as troubled insurance conglomerate AIG being hit by a record $US61.7billion ($97.8billion) shortfall, and HSBC's consumer finance division requiring further capital injections for several years.   Other concerns include what will happen to financial stocks if the corporate regulator ASIC lifts the ban on short selling on March 6 and allows hedge funds back in to short-sell them.   And there is still a lot of risk in the market. Two of the country's biggest margin lenders, Leveraged Equities and the Commonwealth Bank's CommSec, have a list of approved margin-lending stocks that must be feeling a lot of heat at the moment given the high loan to value ratios (LVRs), on some of the more speculative stocks that it offers clients with a diversified portfolio.   While this is a good product during bull markets, because it allows clients with a portfolio including four blue-chip stocks to take out margin loans on small-cap stocks, when things go into meltdown, even blue chips look stressed, putting pressure on the whole portfolio.   For instance, at March 1, CommSec was offering LVRs (which is the ratio of the amount lent to the value of the equity) at 70 per cent for Network Ten, 70 per cent for Suncorp, 70 per cent for Harvey Norman and 70 per cent for Macquarie Group.   Leveraged Equities was offering lending margins of 75 per cent for listed property trust Mirvac, 75 per cent for Macquarie Airports and 75 per cent for Qantas.   In the case of port and rail operator Asciano, Leveraged Equities no longer offers it as an accepted stock for margin lending, but CommSec has kept it on with an LVR of 70 per cent.   Since January 1, Asciano's shares have fallen from $1.51 to a close yesterday of 63c after hitting a record low of 44c last Friday. To put the riskiness of this stock into some sort of context, in August 2007 Asciano's share price was $11.90.   It is no surprise then that Commonwealth Bank's margin lending business made 500 margin calls to clients on Monday, as the stock market plunged to its lowest level in five years.   According to Brian Phelps, executive manager of CFDs and geared investments at CommSec, the bank is trying to reduce the number of margin calls by sending clients SMSs before a margin call to give them time to either pump in more money or increase their equities. It is not hard to see why: margin lending is a lucrative business. According to Ratecity, margin lenders can earn anything from 7.8 per cent to 8.8 per cent on a variable margin loan.   He said back in October the bank made 2000 margin calls in one day. Margin calls force investors with margin loans to cough up extra cash or sell stock to avoid their stock being sold from under them.   Margin lending has been responsible for many high-profile company directors, including the backers of Allco Finance group, ABC Learning Centres' Eddy Groves and Melbourne business identity Geoff Lord, hit with massive margin calls.   The sheer magnitude of margin calls in the past year has forced at least one of the bigger margin lenders to upgrade its systems to cope with margin calls.   The Minister for Super and Corporate Law Nick Sherry confirmed yesterday that the regulation of margin lending would be 'greatly improved' by ensuring disclosure would be clear, succinct and contain information on commissions.   Sherry also confirmed margin lending would have its own tailored responsible lending obligations, including a requirement for the ultimate lender to know whether the capital being brought to the table by the retail borrower was in fact their own, or whether it was itself debt, such as equity from a home.   Reforms of margin lending are years overdue. Just ask the many hapless investors at Storm Financial, which was responsible for advising its clients on margin loan arrangements -- many now have portfolios which are worth less than the loans that have been taken out to buy them.   Blake Dawson partner Lisa Simmons said what happened at Storm raised the question of adequate regulation of credit and also the disclosure given to consumers of the brokerage/commissions which the advisers receive from recommending loan products.   Right now, credit is not a financial product for the purposes of the AFS licensing and this means consumers don't yet receive the same levels of disclosure about commissions on margin lending arrangements as are prescribed in relation to financial products.   Then there is the question of whether consumers were informed that the advice they received was biased and resulted in the advisers being paid a commission for the loans that were taken out.   The conclusion is overwhelming: margin lending is risky business and Sherry needs to look at ways to protect unsuspecting investors from themselves.
