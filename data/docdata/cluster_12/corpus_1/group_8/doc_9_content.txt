  A union has warned National Australia Bank executives to expect a Pacific Brands-type campaign criticising their salaries if it presses ahead with rumoured job cuts.  National secretary of the Finance Sector Union Leon Carter said there were rumours the NAB would announce job cuts on March 12 when the banks new chief Cameron Clyne unveils his corporate blueprint.  He said the size of the expected job cuts was not known, but a major announcement would not be made unless the figure was substantial.  Mr Carter warned the FSU would wage a campaign similar to that run by the Textile Clothing and Footwear Union against corporate salaries when Pacific Brands recently announced 1850 jobs would go.  It just defies logic that they can continue to pay themselves so much, Mr Carter said.  The only two groups that get any dividend from these cost reductions in the shedding of jobs are shareholders and the executives, who get a bonus. It is time that stopped.  Former NAB chief John Stewart received a fixed salary of $2.75 million, while several other directors received more than $1 million in the last financial year.  Mr Carter said with the Australian government bailing out the banks, the financial institutions should promise not to send jobs offshore.  If we are going to be bailing out and helping these banks, then that money has got to be conditional, and at the very least they can make one condition that no jobs go overseas, Mr Carter said.  The federal government announced last year that it would guarantee the $600-$700 billion deposits in Australian financial institutions.  NAB spokesman George Wright on Friday said speculation on job cuts was unfortunate but to be expected ahead of the March 12 strategy announcement.  We will not be making any comment on it (the rumour), other than to say that the bank is very strong, and there are parts of the business where we are hiring more people, Mr Wright said.  Rumours of job cuts at NAB come amid the current global turmoil that has hit financial institutions hard.  Last year ANZ announced about 1000 jobs would go in Australia and New Zealand.  There have been recent reports that Goldman Sachs JBWere may cut as many as five per cent of its employees in Australia.  Last year NAB chairman Michael Chaney warned bad debts would rise amid testing times in 2009 and dividend levels could not be guaranteed.  In February NAB said its first-half profit was likely to rise by about 20 per cent before provisions for bad debts thrown up the deteriorating economic climate.  NAB is due to post its audited first half 2009 results on April 28.
