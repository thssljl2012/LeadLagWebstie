The Federal Government is lobbying banks to cut fees after a report found they are charging some of the rich world's highest banking costs at a time of economic crisis.  Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, whose government has guaranteed the deposits and wholesale funding of Australia's banks, said he and the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, had recently expressed their concern in talks with local bank executives about high fees and charges. 'Absolutely. The Treasurer and I have met again with the banks in recent weeks and we have raised expressly the question of bank fees and charges,'' Mr Rudd said today in a radio interview. 'We will continue on this because everyone out there... is facing a really tough time and we don't want to see anyone adding to this burden by unnecessary charges,'' he added.  The report, released by Fujitsu Consulting on Thursday, said Australian households paid about 22% more in bank fees than households in Britain and 11% more than American households, partly because of weakening bank competition.  The report estimates Australian banks - dominated by the Big Four, NAB, CBA, Westpac and ANZ - will draw about $5.25 billion in fees from households this year.  It said the big banks could continue to lift bank fees and grow interest margins this year as they gobbled up market share surrendered by weaker non-bank lenders.  Banks on defensive  The Australian Bankers' Association (ABA), representing the banks, said it did not agree with the findings. 'ABA research shows Australia's bank fees rank about mid range compared to other overseas countries, and students, pensioners and low income customers access some of the least expensive banking services in the world,'' said ABA chief executive David Bell.  But Australian banking lacks intense competition, partly because the four major banks are forbidden from taking each other over by law. Even the competition regulator said this week that the sector bore some hallmarks of a 'comfortable oligopoly''.  The Reserve Bank recently imposed a reform on ATM fees, requiring the banks to inform customers of ATM charges when withdrawing at ATM's not belonging to their bank. 'Australian banking is very competitive ... our fees are competitively priced when you have a look at other countries,'' a spokesman for No. 4 lender ANZ said, adding the bank was constantly reviewing its pricing.  Australian banks have weathered the global credit crunch better than US and European peers, largely because they are not heavily exposed to subprime debt and because job losses have yet to have a real impact on local households.  But the slowing global economy and difficulties faced by large corporate borrowers are raising bad debts and curbing lending growth, putting pressure on profits.  On Friday, Australian regional lender Bank of Queensland said it would cut 150 positions, or about 10% of its staff, by the end of March. 5 Mar Australian households on average pay 22% more in bank fees than UK ...
