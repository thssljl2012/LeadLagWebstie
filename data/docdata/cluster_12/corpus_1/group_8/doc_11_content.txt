ANZ Banking Group Ltd has appointed Shayne Elliott as group managing director of its institutional business.  Mr Elliott, who will report directly to ANZ chief executive Mike Smith, will be responsible for the institutional banking division globally.  This includes relationship banking, global markets, transaction banking and specialised lending, and balance sheet management.  Mr Elliott, 45, joined ANZ on June 1 from EFG-Hermes, the largest investment bank in the Middle East, where he was head of business development. 'His experience in international corporate and institutional banking in Asia, Australia and New Zealand makes him uniquely qualified to continue the transformation and growth of the business and to contribute to the Groups super regional strategy,' Mr Smith said in a statement on Thursday.  Mr Elliott replaces Alex Thursby who had been acting in the role since August last year.  Mr Thursby will continue his permanent role as chief executive of ANZ's Asia Pacific operation.
