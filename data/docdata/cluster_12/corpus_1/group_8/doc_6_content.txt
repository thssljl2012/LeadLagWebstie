Significantly, the survey results showed that the market values of Gulf banks were less affected than their global counterparts.  The survey noted that several bankers expressed the opinion that among the factors that made the market values of Gulf banks less susceptible to the global crisis are: their activities are mainly concentrated on the local market as opposed to global banks that expanded their lending operations to a number of countries around the Gulf banks were not affected by the real estate mortgages crisis in and ready availability of liquidity because the Gulf countries were supporting local banks by depositing substantial revenues.  Financial allocations against failure in payments are considered to be the most important element that made the market values of Gulf less affected by the crisis. Beginning in the fourth quarter of last year, the substantial allocations made by Gulf banks are considered as a guarantee of their ability to cope with any effects of the global crisis and defaults in loan repayments.  Local bankers consider that despite the profits of Gulf banks being affected by their allocations, they gain in assurance against serious effects. Furthermore, the excellent profits achieved by Gulf banks during 2008 reflect their strong performance and ability to survive the current crisis.  The survey also noted several other factors that made Gulf Banks' market values less affected by the global crisis, these being semi-guaranteed consumer loans, the central banks' major role in eliminating risks of local banks, and substantial government spending to compensate for the shortage of funds for private sector projects.    2009 Al Bawaba (www.albawaba.com) Opinions - No Opinions found for this article //$("").attr("src", verify (form) if //show the loader //try to submit the form via ajax data $.post('index.php', data, function(serverResponse) else masterReplyOpinionId(id) Keep your contributions civil, tasteful and relevant.
