A strategic partner has offloaded 100 million shares of China Construction Bank (00939) just over a week before the lender reveals its results on March 27. The sale came before two strategic shareholders - Bank of America and the Singaporean government's investment firm Temasek - were expected to offload their shares, although the pair have promised not to sell their stakes in the mainland lender before May 7. Bank of America has 39 billion H shares available for sale and Temasek 13.5 billion. The US bank also has 25.5 billion shares that can only be unlocked from August 2011. A CCB shareholder yesterday reaped HK$405 million after placing 100 million shares through UBS during the midday break at HK$4.05 each, a discount of 2.9% to its morning close of HK$4.17. The placement price also represented a 2.6% discount to yesterday's close of HK$4.2. Sources said a Chinese strategic partner sold the CCB stake yesterday. A CCB spokesman noted the sale but declined to give details.
