ZURICH, March 26 (Reuters) - UBS has made a 305 million Swiss franc ($272 million) gain on a bond buyback announced a week ago that has also boosted its capital ratio, the Swiss bank said on Thursday.  UBS said it had bought back bonds for a total of 537 million francs relating to a principal amount of 842 million francs.  It also said the repurchase boosted its Tier 1 capital ratio by 0.1 percent. UBS had a Tier 1 ratio -- a key measure of capital strength -- of 11.5 percent at the end of 2008. It will update the figure with first-quarter results in May.  UBS said a week ago it would buy back up to 1 billion euros ($1.36 billion) of four subordinate issues with maturity dates between November 2015 and September 2019 and a notional value of around 7 billion Swiss francs.  IFR Markets, a Thomson Reuters online news and market analysis service, reported that UBS had bought the bonds back at a heavy discount, paying 62.50 and 65 percent of the principal amount on the four bonds.  Kepler Capital Markets analyst Dirk Becker said the fact UBS had not made a bigger profit by buying back more bonds was actually a positive sign:  'It shows investors are optimistic. They will only tender at these prices if they think UBS won't be able to pay back.'  UBS shares were down 4.1 percent at 12.22 Swiss francs at 1543 GMT compared with a 1 percent firmer DJ Stoxx European banking index.  The UBS move comes after U.S. bank Morgan Stanley netted a $2.3 billion gain last year after it repurchased $12.1 billion of fixed and floating rate long-term debt.  UBS, the world's biggest wealth manager, was one of the banks hit hardest by the subprime crisis, prompting it to raise capital three times in less than 18 months in order to shore up its balance sheet.
