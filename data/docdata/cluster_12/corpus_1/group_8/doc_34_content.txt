Strong recoveries by Lloyds Banking and Aviva, aided by buoyant oil companies, enabled Footsie to finish the day on a positive note.  Life assurance stock Aviva was the day's best performer, shrugging off the threat of a downgrade by Moodys, the credit rating agency, to claw back a portion of the heavy losses suffered last week after the company's poorly received results.  The performance was in stark contrast to other stocks in the insurance sector, most notably Legal &amp; General and Friends Provident, both of which were sharply lower.  Lloyds Banking started the day in the doghouse and ended it in the penthouse, as the market got to grips with the terms of the bank's participation in the government's Asset Protection Scheme (APS).  The government has taken a 65% controlling stake in Lloyds Banking Group, which could rise to 77%, for underwriting 260m of the bank's toxic assets. Chairman Sir Victor Blank and chief executive Eric Daniels will discuss the deal with shareholders on Monday as it emerged that 83% of the bad loans to be guaranteed by the government were on the books of HBOS.  Broker Charles Stanley believes the threat of complete nationalisation has been 'reduced significantly' through the deal. It believes Lloyds will be loss making in 2009 and potentially loss making in 2010, unless the outlook in the economy improves, 'but on a more positive note, at least today's announcement should improve the group's credit ratings and takes it a step nearer to a time when the market is able to value the group on an earnings basis.'  Pressure remained on Barclays, however, which has yet to announce whether it will place any of its assets in the, while HSBC also encountered a wave of selling ahead of going ex-rights this week.  With the price of oil rising towards the $50 a barrel level on the futures market, oils were back in demand. BP, Royal Dutch Shell and BG Group all headed higher but all were outperformed by Tullow Oil, which this morning announced it has made a 'significant' highly-pressured light hydrocarbon accumulation at its Tweneboa-1 exploration well offshore Ghana. Tullow has also finalised arrangements for $2bn of new reserve based lend debt facilities.  London Stock Exchange was marked sharply lower today after Japanese broker Nomura cut its rating on the stock from 'buy' to 'neutral' and advised clients to switch into Deutsche Bourse.  Mining giant Xstrata was also hit by broker comment, with Morgan Stanley cutting its price target for the stock from 750p to 330p. The US bank also cut its price target for Xstrata's sector peer Anglo American from 1450p to 1235p.  Elsewhere in the mining sector, Sterlite Industries (India), a unit of Vedanta Resources, said it has signed a new deal to buy substantially all the operating assets of Asarco for up to $1.7bn. It will pay $1.1bn in cash on closing for the Tucson based mining copper producer, plus another $600m over a nine year period. The price is about $1bn less than last year's projected estimate of $2.6bn as the value of mining assets has plunged and copper prices have tumbled.  Rio Tinto has agreed to sell its Jacobs Ranch coal mine in Wyoming to Arch Coal Inc for $761m in cash. 'The sale of Jacobs Ranch is a further illustration of the high quality of our assets and the strong value we are able to obtain for shareholders,' said chief financial officer Guy Elliott. 'This brings the total asset sales announced this year to $2.5 billion.'  As forecast, housebuilder Bovis has cut its final dividend after big write-downs and provisions pushed it into the red last year. Pre-tax losses for 2008 were 78.7m against profits of 123.6m, after inventory provisions of 75.2m, restructuring charges of 5.7m and impairment charges of 12.2m all totalling 93.1m. Broker Panmure Gordon has raised its rating for the stock from 'hold' to 'buy' following the results.  A confident Petrofac has upped its dividend by 55% after the oil and gas facilities provider reported a 39.1% jump in full year earnings. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose to $419m in the 12 months ended 31 December 2008, up from $301.3m the year before. Revenue rose 36.4% to $3.3bn.  Underwriter Brit Insurance, sponsor of the Oval cricket ground, has confirmed it is leaving the UK and will set up in the Netherlands. The move is reportedly due to unfavourable corporate tax regime in the UK, with Brit today adding the Netherlands has a strong financial services sector, stable fiscal strategy and excellent communications. Brit's profits in 2008 tax fell to 89.2m (2007: 191.2m) with net assets at 248.2p (2007: 248.0p). The dividend for the year is unchanged at 15p excluding special payments.  Fellow underwriter Chaucer reported its first loss in seven years due to the investment losses arising from the turmoil in the financial markets at the end of last year.  Insurer Hiscox revealed a 55% decline in annual pre-tax profit after hefty payouts following hurricanes Ike and Gustav and as investments suffered amid financial market volatility.  Elsewhere in the insurance sector, insurance-focused investment vehicle Resolution is sharply lower after it emerged that some of its directors, including founder Chris Cowdery, are under investigation by the Financial Services Authority for 'certain actions' that took place when they were on the board of the previous incarnation of Resolution, when the insurer was the subject of a tug of war between Friends Provident and privately owned Pearl Group.  Spirax-Sarco Engineering, the steam valve and pump maker, posted strong results for the full year but 2009 has started poorly as it prepares for a tougher market by cutting jobs. The group said in the early weeks of 2009, sales were down around 5% at constant currency, compared with the relatively strong early period in 2008. Pre-tax profits for 2008 were 90m from last year's 72.8m on revenue that increased 20% to 502.3m. Results benefited from favourable currency movements.  Sportswear retailer JJB Sports confirmed that it has received a number of second round offers for its Fitness Clubs business. The group said is currently considering the terms of these offers with its advisers and its lending banks.  Scottish cake and confectionery firm Lees Foods said its Patisserie UK unit has been placed in administration with immediate effect. The group said all attempts to sell the speciality bakery and desserts business, which currently employs 41 people at its facility in West Lothian, have been unsuccessful in the current climate.  Independent oil and gas firm Sterling is in advanced talks with its banks to defer the schedule of repayments on its loan until mid August.
