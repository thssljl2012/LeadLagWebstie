Cash-strapped housebuilder Barratt Developments should be added to the long list of companies reportedly queuing up to tap the market for funds, according to Citicorp.  The Financial Times reported Friday that dozens of British companies are preparing to issue fresh equity in coming weeks with bankers expecting more than 30bn to be raised this year through share offerings.  Citi reckons that Barratt's debt position will force it to be one of those issuing shares which, Citi predicts, would lead to 'large-scale dilution to existing holders'.  The US bank has downgraded its view on Barratt from 'hold' to 'sell' and chopped the price target from 80p to 50p.
