MELBOURNE -(Dow Jones)- Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) Friday named   Christine Ip  as head of its China operations as it looks to step up its presence in the region. 'Our goal is for ANZ to become a top-four foreign bank in China,' said ANZ North East Asia CEO Alistair Bulloch said. 'Christine will be responsible for building our institutional banking capabilities, growing our retail presence and further leveraging our partnerships with Bank of Tianjin and Shanghai Rural Commercial Bank,' he said in a statement.  Ip joins from Standard Chartered Bank, where she most recently oversaw that bank's consumer banking for China. She will commence with ANZ on Jan. 12, subject to regulatory approval.  She replaces   Andrew McGregor  as chief executive of ANZ Bank's China operations, who will retire following a 41-year career with the bank.   -By Lyndal McFarland, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-3-9650-0637; lyndal.mcfarland@ dowjones.com   (END) Dow Jones Newswires 01-08-091839ET Copyright (c) 2009 Dow Jones &amp;amp; Company, Inc.
