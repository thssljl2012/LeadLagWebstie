 Market watch top headlines Australian reports Aust markets:  :  :  World reports World commodities:  World markets:   SGM, BNB, CPA, CBA, MAP,   AFP 2009-01-24   Top US motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson said on Friday it will slash 1,100 jobs and production capacity as profits tumble following reduced sales amid a deepening recession.  The job cuts will be made over two years. 'We obviously need to make adjustments to address the current volume declines,' said Harley-Davidson's chief executive Jim Ziemer. 'But we are also determined to do that in a way that will make us more competitive for the long term.' The Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company suffered a 58 per cent reduction in profit to $US77.8 million ($A118.6 million) for the final quarter of 2008 from the same period a year earlier.  Worldwide retail sales of the iconic motorcycle maker fell 13.1 per cent while domestic sales were down 19.6 per cent.  For the full-year 2008, net profit fell 30 per cent to $US654.7 million ($A998.02 million) and sales dropped 2.0 per cent to $US5.6 billion ($A8.54 billion). 'We reduced our production levels prudently in 2008, helping our dealers achieve lower inventory levels,' said Ziemer, 'and we're going to show similar discipline in 2009.'
