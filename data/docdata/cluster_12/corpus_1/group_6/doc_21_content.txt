, 01:05 GMT  MELBOURNE, Jan 30 (Reuters Basis Point) - OneSteel Ltd , Australia's No. 2 steel maker, has raised the margin on  the refinancing of a A$300 million ($196 million) three-year  revolving credit to attract banks to take part in the deal,  sources said.  The company has lifted the margin to 240 basis points (bps)  over BBSY, from the 200 bps originally offered, two banking  sources said.  The margin is based on an interest coverage ratio of between  four and five times. The fees remain unchanged, the sources said.  OneSteel would not comment specifically on pricing.  'We do not provide any comment on pricing. Only to say the  margin on the new deal is higher compared to the old deal being  refinanced, but the base rate is lower,' A company spokesman  said.  In a separate statement, OneSteel said on Tuesday it has  received commitments for A$208 million for the refinancing.  Potential lenders have been invited to commit A$25 million or  more for a 50 bps fee and the senior lead manager title, or less  than A$25 million for a 40 bps fee and lead manager status.  Mandated lead arrangers Commonwealth Bank of Australia,  nabCapital and Westpac Banking Corp launched the refinancing in  November last year to OneSteel's existing lenders, as well as  potential new lenders on a best-efforts basis.  The deal is to refinance A$300 million in debt maturing in  September 2009 that is part of an A$800 million revolver that was  extended in May 2007.  The new loan is being borrowed through OneSteel Finance Pty  Ltd.  The steel manufacturer last tapped the syndicated loan market  in September 2007 for a A$1.1 billion five-year revolver arranged  by CBA and Westpac. The opening margin on that deal was 52.5 bps  over BBSY.  Lenders to that facility were: ANZ, Bank of America, Bank of  China, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, BBVA, HSBC, Mizuho Corporate  Bank, nabCapital, OCBC, Scotiabank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp,  TD Securities and WestLB.  The credit crunch has significantly reduced potential  lenders' hold appetites even to existing clients, market  participants said. Syndication times have also lengthened as  deals face tighter scrutiny by credit committees.  OneSteel said it would provide a further update on its debt  refinancing at the release of its interim financial results on  Feb. 17.  Separately, the company also announced it had replaced a  A$100 million bilateral loan due in May this year with a new  A$150 million deal that matures in September 2011, and that it  had extended two smaller bilaterals of A$50 million each until  December 2011 from June and August 2009.
