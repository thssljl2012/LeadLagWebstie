ORIGIN Energy's multi-million-dollar retail transformation project could be in jeopardy after it was revealed that a key international supplier had been blacklisted by the World Bank.  India-based Wipro Technologies, which employs hundreds of workers in Australia, was named Origin's preferred partner for the project late last year.  Wipro was expected to supply consolidated billing for gas and electricity to Origin's 3 million customers, based on the SAP software platform.  The complex project was set to kick off in May, with implementation in two years.  Under the contract, some Origin IT staff would be employed by Wipro.  'Origin is aware of recent media reports regarding Wipro not being able to contract to the World Bank, and is seeking clarification from Wipro on the issue,' an Origin spokesman said yesterday.  The World Bank slapped a four-year ban on Wipro in June 2007 for providing improper benefits to bank staff. The bank made the disclosure two days ago.  Suresh Senapaty, Wipro's global chief financial officer, said the shares offered to World Bank senior executives were in line with financial regulations and the company had nothing to hide.  'We offered those shares to all our customers and there was no concession or subsidy,' Mr Senapaty told The Australian from his Bangalore headquarters.  'The World Bank senior employees signed a declaration saying there wasn't a conflict of interest in accepting the shares.'  He said the company would be contacting all its customers to explain the situation.  Wipro's other local customers include ANZ Bank, Telstra, Axa, Cadbury's, and Hutchison.  IT services company Satyam is also on the World Bank's blacklist.
