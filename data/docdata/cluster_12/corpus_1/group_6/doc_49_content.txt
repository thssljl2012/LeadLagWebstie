Even as the ANZ National Bank is cutting 100 jobs to outsource work to India its chief executive is to attend attend a job summit on how to keep New Zealanders in work, the union for financial workers says.  Finsec said today the bank announced 100 job cuts this week in its latest move to cut costs and send work offshore to Bangalore in India.  The bank has also backed away from public commitments to provide all affected staff other work, said Finsec campaigns director Andrew Campbell.  'These staff face an uncertain future in a shrinking job market. In the middle of a recession, our most profitable company is pulling the rug out from dozens more Kiwi workers.  'ANZ National is displaying zero social responsibility in pursuit of maximum profits.'  Mr Campbell said ANZ National chief executive Graham Hodges would be attending the Government's upcoming Jobs Summit and should use the opportunity to commit to protecting New Zealand jobs in his own bank.  'The best thing that Graham Hodges can do to support New Zealand jobs is to keep his current staff in work.'  He should pledge to offer an alternative job to all staff affected by his offshoring, Mr Campbell said.  Finsec said most of the jobs were from Wellington and some from Auckland. Ninety jobs in institutional operations, retail payments and credit card operations were being offshored to Bangalore, India. In April last year, ANZ National announced the jobs of around 5 percent of its workforce, between 400 and 500 jobs, would be sent offshore.  Mr Campbell said in Australia only 38% of 538 ANZ employees who lost their jobs were redeployed back within the bank despite assurances about redeployment.  ANZ National Bank was not able to immediately respond to the union.
