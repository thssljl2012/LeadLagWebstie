HONG KONG  Bank of China stock tumbled yesterday after Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shings foundation sold shares worth about $500m in the lender, the latest investor to cut its investment in Chinas banking sector. Struggling investment firm Royal Bank of Scotland said it may also sell its own stake in the Chinese lender.  The Li Ka Shing Foundation sold 2-billion shares at HK$1,98 each  a 7,5% discount to Wednesdays closing price, according to a term sheet for the deal. The total amount raised in the sale, which closed yesterday , was $511m.  Bank of China, the mainlands third-biggest lender, fell 8,4% on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Lis sale should not be interpreted as scepticism about the Bank of Chinas prospects, a foundation spokesman said.   Li still controls 3-billion shares and the spokesman said he planned to hold them for a very long time'. The foundation has many investment projects and Mr Li buys and sells once in a while, so this is just a normal fund allocation, the spokesman said .  The sale comes a day after Bank of America, looking to raise money to cope with economic turmoil, sold a 2,5% stake in China Construction Bank for about $2,8bn.
