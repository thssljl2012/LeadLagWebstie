SENIOR National Australia Bank executive Ahmed Fahour has been sounded out by the Rudd Government to head its new corporate lending vehicle.  The Federal Government and the four major banks -- Commonwealth, NAB, Westpac and ANZ -- are finalising terms under which the new fund will operate.   The lending initiative is being established to cover any gaps in the refinancing of corporate loans due to the possible withdrawal of foreign banks from the Australian market.   If Mr Fahour agrees to take up the role it is not clear whether he would leave the bank or be seconded to the new agency.   As the former chief executive of NAB's Australian business, Mr Fahour has played an instrumental role in turning around the group's performance in the past four years.   However, speculation has been mounting that he will soon leave the group after he was moved out of the key role by NAB's new group CEO, Cameron Clyne.   Troubled offshore banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Germany's HypoVereinsBank, which are labouring under heavy writedowns, have traditionally provided funding to Australian companies as members of multi-bank loan syndicates.   But with the credit crisis intensifying in Europe and North America, the Federal Government has grown concerned that some companies may be unable to roll over their syndicated loans if the overseas banks are forced to beat a retreat to their home markets.
