SYDNEY, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Coal-to-groceries conglomerate Wesfarmers Ltd is close to a deal to refinance A$7 billion ($4.7 billion) in debt due over the next two years, the Australian Financial Review said on Monday.   In an unsourced report, the paper said Wesfarmers, which took on billions of dollars in debt to buy the Coles supermarket chain in 2007, had negotiated fresh terms with about two thirds of its creditors. 'The accord does not rule out a major capital raising by Wesfarmers in the coming weeks as the conglomerate battles challenging market conditions, slumping earnings and falling asset values,' the paper said. The company's shares took a hit last week after it said it might have to cut its dividend this year amid a slowdown in consumer spending and as the financial market turmoil slashes the value of some of its investments.   The paper said Wesfarmers' key relationship banks, which include Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and BNP Paribas were in the process of signing up to new refinancing terms.   New terms had not yet been discussed with its remaining creditors, though the debt extensions being negotiated with the key banks would not be dependent on being ratified by these banks.
