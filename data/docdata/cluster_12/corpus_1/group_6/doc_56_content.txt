 said it had restructured its premium services division. The new structure had separated Business and Corporate from the existing Institutional Banking and Market areas, the bank said.  The company said that the restructure followed the departure of group executive Stuart Grimshaw late last year.  Group CEO Ralph Norris said the separation of Business and Corporate, which included Agribusiness and Commsec Retail from Institutional Banking and Market areas reflected the increased importance of each to the company's business mix.'The separation of Local Business Banking, Corporate Financial Services, Agribusiness and Private Client Services areas from Institutional Banking and Markets under the responsibility of separate Group Executives recognises the increasing scale, diversity and importance of these businesses to the group' he said.The company said that these divisions had grown strongly and increased in customer satisfaction. The split would also seek to capitalise on these key measures.  The Commonwealth Bank also said that it had appointed Ian Narev as group executive business and private banking. Mr Narev would move from his current role as group head of strategy on January 27 2009. Mr Narev had been with the bank for 18 months, bringing with him experience as partner and dead of New Zealand for McKinsey and Company.  The company said an announcement on the replacement for Mr Narev as head of strategy would be imminent. Ian Saines would continue as acting head of institutional banking and markets until a permanent replacement had been found.  At 1038, CBA was up 8c to $27.43
