COMMONWEALTH Bank plans to split its corporate division from the institutional banking unit to better manage capital.  The restructure of the premium business services division of Australia's biggest lender will create a new business and corporate division, including agribusiness and private client services.  That will leave institutional and markets as a distinct unit.  The bank said in a statement today it had appointed group head of strategy Ian Narev as the new chief of the business and private banking division. Mr Narev will begin his role on January 27.  Southern Cross Equities analyst TS Lim said the new corporate banking divisions business was based around lending money to customers, whereas the institutional and markets division involved mostly charging fees for financial services.  Each segment has different capital needs (and) when you split them up you get away from cross-subsidisation of units, Mr Lim said.  That makes it more transparent and it will be better for the bank as a whole, as they can channel funds to where the greatest returns will be.
