HERRINGBONE, the upmarket clothing retailer that collapsed last month, has been put up for sale before its second creditors' meeting due in a fortnight.  Administrator Martin Green, of BRI Ferrier, advertised the business for sale yesterday as  a going concern. He told the Herald he had already received expressions of interest from competitors, including Rhodes &amp;amp; Beckett. He declined to name other suitors, saying they included smaller private equity players.  Herringbone, a one-time favourite with professional and finance industry workers, was unable to pay $4 million in debt after its founders, John Mutton and Matthew Jensen, secured funding of up to $7.9 million from St George Bank in July 2007 to expand the business.  Herringbone concentrated its stores near the country's financial districts, including in Chifley Tower and at Circular Quay in Sydney. But its cuff-linked well-to-do customers have been among the hardest hit in the financial crisis.  While St George is the biggest creditor, representatives of AMP Capital Investors and the Commonwealth Bank also attended Herringbone's first creditors' meeting last month, along with trade suppliers.  'It's got a good brand and a great niche market but they haven't really capitalised the business properly,' Mr Green said. 'It needs an investor or a trade sale to finance the business and move on.  'The business owes a considerable amount of money. Most of their borrowings have gone on fitting out shops and setting up the business.'  Money is also owed on Herringbone's head office property, owned by a company controlled by Mr Mutton and Mr Jensen called Mutjen.  About 90 per cent of the cost of the head office was borrowed, Mr Green said.  Since administrators were appointed, about 12 per cent of Herringbone's staff have been laid off, mainly from head office. Casual sales staff had been maintained to cope with Christmas sales.  The next creditors' meeting is likely to be adjourned for the administrator to consider offers for the business, which are due by January 19.
