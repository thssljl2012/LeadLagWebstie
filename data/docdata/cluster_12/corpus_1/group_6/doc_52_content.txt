The Australian finance sector is bleeding more jobs, with layoffs at American Express and reportedly at broker Merrill Lynch .  Merrill Lynch was bought by Bank of America as the global financial crisis escalated last year, and will not comment on the rumours.  American Express will not confirm numbers but the ABC understands there have been several rounds of lay-offs as part of the company's global drive to shed 7,000 staff.  The company says it is sending 50 call centre positions in Sydney overseas and it is doing everything it can to support those affected.  St George is also sending about 35 jobs to India as part of an ongoing plan to move part of its mortgage operations offshore.  Finance Sector Union national policy director Rod Masson says it is not necessary to send jobs overseas. 'Large and profitable organisations such as St George and its owner Westpac should be investing in Australian jobs,' he said. 'We need to have the skills being developed here in the finance industry so that we can be a strong financial player on a global scale as we move out of this global financial crisis.'
