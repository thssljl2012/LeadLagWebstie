VN-Index lost 5.05 points, or 1.62 percent, to close at a 10-day low of 307.13. Of its 175 members, 26 gained and 113 declined.  Trading remained quiet, with only 7.7 million shares being traded.  The outlook on corporate earnings is very gloomy, given the current economic situation, Huynh Anh Tuan, chief executive officer of the Ho Chi Minh City-based SJC Securities, said.  Companies have started to release 2008 earnings and many of them have made losses or missed their profit targets. For those who managed to make some profit, it was because of the gains they made in the first half of 2008.  In addition, people also lost a lot of their confidence in the market after HSBC said the Vietnamese market is no longer investable for overseas investors.  Besides, almost half of January has passed but we are still not yet clear how and when the government is going to implement its US$6 billion stimulus package to boost the economy. So, the market has no momentum.  Dau Tu Chung Khoan (Securities investment) newspaper quoted Kim Long Securities Company Deputy General Director Pham Vinh Thanh as saying, Companies with a strong cash flow and those not involved in finance are a good choice this year.  He added that petroleum, transport, technology and financial stocks would be his top picks when the market shows signs of recovery, without explaining his choices.
