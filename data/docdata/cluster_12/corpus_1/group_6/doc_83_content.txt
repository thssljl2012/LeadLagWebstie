The new division will include agribusiness and private client services.  The bank said in a statement it had appointed group head of strategy Ian Narev as the new chief of the business and private banking division. Mr Narev will begin his role on January 27. 'The separation of local business banking, corporate financial services, agribusiness and private client services areas from institutional banking and markets under the responsibility of separate group executives recognises the increasing scale, diversity and importance of these businesses to the group's overall business mix,' chief executive Ralph Norris said in the statement.  Mr Norris said an announcement would be made in the near future of the head of strategy and executive in charge of institutional banking and markets.
