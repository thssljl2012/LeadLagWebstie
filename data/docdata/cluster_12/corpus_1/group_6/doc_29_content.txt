Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd (CBA) has restructured its premium business services division, appointing two group executives to newly created roles.   In a statement on Monday, CBA said it would separate its business and corporate operations from existing institutional banking and markets areas to improve customer service.   The bank appointed Ian Narev as group executive business and private banking, responsible for both of those customer segments.   Mr Narev, formerly group head of strategy, will commence his new role from January 27, CBA said, adding that an announcement about a replacement head of strategy was 'imminent'. The appointment of a permanent group executive to the institutional banking and markets area would be announced soon, the bank said. Until then, Ian Staines will continue as acting group executive.
