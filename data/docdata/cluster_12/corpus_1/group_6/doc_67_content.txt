The New Albany-based company said the $47.5 million credit facility with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is due January 2012 and will be used for operating and working capital. The facility replaces a $50 million agreement originated in 2004 and set to expire next year but is paid in full.  Chief Financial Officer Chad Utrup said the new facility provides relief from recent covenant compliance pressures under our previous senior credit agreement while at the same time keeps our ongoing interest costs relatively unchanged. The previous agreement had a number of stipulations, including those that limited annual capital expenditures and restricted asset dispositions, acquisitions, dividends and company debt, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Commercial Vehicle at the end of the third quarter was in compliance with the facility.  The new facility, Commercial Vehicle said, has operating performance targets and capital expenditure limits, but only during the first year of the term. As a result, spokesman John Hyre told Columbus Business First, the company can focus more on the business and less on monitoring compliance terms.  The new credit facility cost the company about $2 million in financing fees; it expects to take on an $800,000 non-cash charge related to the previous facility.  Commercial Vehicle (NASDAQ:CVGI) hasnt reported its fourth-quarter results but has told stockholders it expects full-year share earnings to range between a loss of 8 cents to a profit of a penny. The company last year was hit with commodity pricing troubles and petroleum-related service costs as fuel and other commodities hit record highs.  The company earned $952,000 on $599.1 million in revenue in the first nine months of 2008.
