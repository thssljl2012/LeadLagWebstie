 Fitch Ratings yesterday put the bank on rating watch negative while it looks at the impact of the plummeting property market on its commercial property loans which made up 23% of its loan book at the end of September and includes some lending to developers. It said the move 'reflects the risks inherent in Clydesdale's large commercial property book' but noted the high probability it would be supported by parent National Australia Bank if necessary. advertisement It said it would resolve the rating over the next six months after reviewing the impact of the deterioration of the Clydesdale's commerical property book on the bank's performance in the six months to March 2009. 'Asset quality ratios at end-September 2008 remained sound, although Fitch expects further deterioration as a result of the rapidly weakening economy and falling property prices in the UK,' it said. It added that Clydesdale's mortgage portfolio was of good quality and it had only a small higher risk credit card and unsecured loan book. Clydesdale took a 175m charge in the year to September to cover loan defaults.  A Clydesdale spokesman said: 'The negative view is simply a reflection of the deteriorating market conditions all UK banks are operating in. 'Despite being one of the first banks to have their ratings reviewed this year, our long term and individual ratings compare strongly against our peers who were evaluated at an earlier stage in the economic cycle.' Other banks exposed to the commercial property market include HBOS, now part of Lloyds Banking Group, whose investments include a 50% stake in private housebuilding firm Crest Nicholson. In December the bank admitted that impairments on its corporate lending book totalled 3.3bn at the end of November.
