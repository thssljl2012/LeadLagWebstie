Article from:   The Australian  WESTPAC Banking and ANZ Banking Group are considering samurai bond raisings in Tokyo.  The raisings will reopen an international corporate debt market that seized up with the Lehman Brothers collapse last September.  If the Australian issues go ahead, they would be the first government-guaranteed samurai bonds, and the first samurais to be placed since the week before Lehman went under.  ANZ spokesman Paul Edwards indicated last night the bank had not committed but was studying the samurai market's potential.  'We do not have any specific plans at the moment but we will be updating Japanese investors in February.'  Westpac did not respond to a request for confirmation of reports that it would undertake a Tokyo raising this month.  Samurai are yen-denominated corporate bonds issued by non-Japanese financial institutions and corporations to Japanese institutional investors, with typical maturities of three to five years.  Australian banks raised almost $9 billion through samurai issues last year, mostly on better terms than those available to the credit-impaired major US banks, before the market snapped shut in mid-September.  ANZ was one of the very last issuers to tap the market with a Y88.5 billion raising (then worth $1.02 billion, before the Aussie crashed to the low Y60s) completed the week before Lehman collapsed.  The new Australian bank raisings, if they go ahead, could reopen an important corporate debt market, although only to financial institutions that are securely backed by government guarantees.  It is understood the Australian bond issues -- likely to be managed by the main facilitators in the Tokyo market, Nikko Citigroup, Daiwa Securities and Nomura Securities -- are being closely watched by several potential European and British issuers.  However, potential Japanese investors could be unnerved by the continuing travails of the European and British majors, highlighted this week by the German Government's second rescue of the Commerzbank-Dresdner Bank merger, this time at a cost of E10 billion ($19.3 billion).  The reopening of the samurai market would take some pressure off the major European and US corporate debt markets.  The European market, in particular, is said to be nearly glutted with paper issued by banks using their new government-guaranteed status for wholesale funding to recapitalise.  Australian banks have raised more than $US20 billion ($28.2billion) through US and European bond issues in the past month.  In the first stage of the global credit crisis -- the 12 months before Lehman collapsed -- the samurai market kept open a rare pool of global corporate funding as other sources dried up.  In the Japanese fiscal year to March 31, samurai bond issues raised Y2.64 trillion (about $40 billion at today's exchange rate), triple the raisings in the preceding 12 months.  The pace increased in the ensuing six months but Daimler's Y43.5 billion issue completed on September 12 was the last samurai raising.  Three days later, Japanese institutions found themselves holding Lehman bonds with a face value of Y195 billion and a practical value of zero.  The following month Iceland's Kaupthing Bank defaulted on interest payments on Y50 billion of bonds issued two years earlier.  Kaupthing, which has Y78 billion worth of samurai bonds outstanding, is now under Icelandic government control and, although there has been no final word, most holders have written off their investment.
