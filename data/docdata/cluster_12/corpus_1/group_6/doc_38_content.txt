Sydney-based creative agency Host has ramped up its offering, adding media to its services and immediately landing the strategic planning element on BankWest's $18m media account.  BankWest's buying duties, formerly handled by Starcom MediaVest, have been handed to Ikon Communications. The move adds to Ikon's buying clout as it already holds the Commonwealth Bank account. CBA acquired Bankwest in October last year.  Anthony Freedman, chief executive at Host confirmed that the agency has established a new media and communications unit called Bring, which will open next week with about $35m on its books. "With BankWest as well as a couple of other clients, it will be about $35m," he said. Former Zenith Optimedia client service director Simon Pugh has been appointed to head the new venture.  30 January 2009
