DUBLIN, Ireland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Research and Markets(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/d28383/mobile_content_a) has announced the addition of the 'Mobile Content &amp; Advertising Perspective / Vol. 2, Issue 1, Edition 1' report to their offering.  EVENT SPOTLIGHT  In November 2008, Visa announced that it would start a mobile payment trial using near field communications (NFC) technology in Guatemala. This will become one of the first attempts to use this technology in Latin America.  The service, called payWave, will be offered in partnership with Banco Industrial and Banco Uno (Citibank); the pilot will last about six months. About 5,000 NFC readers have been installed in strategic sites such as restaurants and stores, and about 200 clients will have data moved onto their mobile handsets. This is not the only mobile payments endeavor in the region: In Brazil and Mexico, for example, providers are using SMS as the communications medium. These services are a logical step for operators that want to offer their customers additional services both in order to add a revenue stream to that of voice and to reduce churn. The NFC trial by Visa, along with the other offerings available in the region, signal an ongoing move into mobile payment services in the region.  The author believes that mobile payments represent an important opportunity for mobile operators due to the lack of banking infrastructure in many areas, the ongoing adoption of advanced mobile services and the recent advances in mobile payment technology.
