(Close-Up Media via COMTEX) -- MGI   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating -- MoneyGram International, a global payment services company, announced it has expanded to 40,000 ExpressPayment agent locations in the U.S. with the rollout of its payment services at CVS and 7-Eleven stores across the country.  MoneyGram agents provide consumers with a variety of payment solutions, including urgent bill payment, prepaid card and money transfer services.  In the past two years, MoneyGram said, it has nearly doubled its number of its ExpressPayment locations, which include prominent retailers such as Walmart, Advance America and Albertsons stores as well as U.S. Bank branch locations. MoneyGram recently completed rolling out its services in 6,200 CVS stores and, through an agreement with Cardtronics, in 2,250 7-Eleven locations.  'The addition of the CVS and 7-Eleven stores allows MoneyGram to provide consumers with more convenient locations to choose from when they need to transfer money, pay bills, reload cards or top up phones,' said Greg Waltz, vice president and general manager of payment products at MoneyGram. 'With our robust network of 40,000 ExpressPayment locations, it is likely that a consumer will be able to access MoneyGram's affordable payment services in their own neighborhood and in the establishments they are likely to frequent on a regular basis.'  Waltz expects more retailers to add financial services in the near future as they seek ways to increase foot traffic and generate revenue. He says retailers are also recognizing an opportunity to serve the growing number of Americans who do not use banks or prefer to pay bills in-person.  'Urgent or same-day bill payment, in particular, is on the rise as more Americans are waiting longer to pay bills and looking for last-minute bill payment alternatives,' said Waltz. 'Our agents provide a valued service with our ExpressPayment service that enables consumers to make a same-day, cash payment to MoneyGram's more than 2,300 direct billers including credit card, telephone, mortgage and auto finance companies.'  MoneyGram Internationa is a global payment services company.
