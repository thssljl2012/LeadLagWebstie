COMMONWEALTH Bank of Australia plans to split its corporate division from the institutional banking unit to better service customers and improve capital management.  The restructure of the premium business services division of Australia's biggest lender will create a new business and corporate division, including agribusiness and private client services.   That will leave institutional and markets as a distinct unit.   The bank said it had appointed group head of strategy Ian Narev as the new chief of the business and private banking division.   Mr Narev will begin his role on January 27.  analyst TS Lim said the new corporate banking division's business was based around lending money to customers, whereas the institutional and markets division involved mostly charging fees for financial services. 'Each segment has different capital needs (and) when you split them up you get away from cross-subsidisation of units,' Mr Lim said. The premium business services division contributed $1.46 billion, or 31 per cent, of the bank's profit for the 12 months to June 30, 2008.   The separation of the divisions under their own executives 'recognises the increasing scale, diversity and importance of these businesses to the group's overall business mix', chief executive Ralph Norris said.   Shares in CBA closed up 8c to $27.43.   CBA is due to report its first-half earnings on February 11.   - AAP
