THE Commonwealth Bank Group has split its premium business services division in two.  And it has created two new roles to fill the shoes of Stuart Grimshaw, who resigned as group executive late last year.  The restructure separates the business and corporate division from the institutional banking and markets area.  Agribusiness and private client services have moved with the business and corporate division, now to be called business and private banking.  The group's strategy head, Ian Narev, will head up the new business and private banking division, while the head of institutional banking and markets is yet to be announced.  In the interim, Ian Saines will continue to act as institutional banking and markets group executive.  Prior to joining the bank 18 months ago, Mr Narev was partner and New Zealand head for McKinsey &amp; Co.  He will take up his new role on January 27.  The group's chief executive, Ralph Norris, said the restructure would enable the bank to improve its focus on servicing the diverse customer segments.  'The separation of local business banking, corporate financial services, agribusiness and private client services areas from institutional banking and markets under the responsibility of separate group executives recognises the increasing scale, diversity and importance of these businesses to the group's overall business mix,' he said.  Mr Grimshaw, the division's former group executive, left the bank in September to become chief executive of boutique funds management group Caledonia Investments.  Mr Norris said a new head of strategy would be announced soon.
