LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The 3.7 billion pound ($5.5 billion) Merseyside Pension Fund said on Monday it had hired fund firms M&amp;G, Blackrock, Newton and TT International to manage assets totalling about 360 million pounds.   The managers will each run active, unconstrained UK equities mandates of about 90 million pounds. The total is equal to a third of the pension scheme's UK equities allocation.   The assets in question are currently managed on a passive basis by Legal &amp; General Investment Management.   Active, unconstrained mandates give managers the freedom to explore different strategies, sectors and asset classes. They contrast with the passive, benchmark-tracking mandates which in the past have dominated pension scheme investments.   The commitment from the Merseyside scheme indicates that its trustees have not lost confidence in managers' ability to post benchmark-busting returns in spite of poor performance around the industry last year.   In the middle of last year, the Merseyside scheme also announced it was switching its European ex-UK equities portfolio to active management from passive. A scheme spokesman said the winner of the approximately 110 million pound mandate would be revealed later this month.   The scheme is also preparing to put out a tender for two bond mandates totalling about 300 million pounds and split evenly between UK gilts and corporate bonds. Hymans Robertson will act as consultant on the tender process. M&amp;G Investments is owned by UK insurer Prudential while Blackrock is now part of Bank of America following the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Newton Investment Management is owned by BNY Mellon and TT International is an independent UK-based fund manager.
