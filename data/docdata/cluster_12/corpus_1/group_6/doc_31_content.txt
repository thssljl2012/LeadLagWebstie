COMMONWEALTH Bank has split its CommSec online trading arm from its institutional banking unit, as part of a reorganisation of one of the bank's biggest business units.  The lending giant has also tapped the former McKinsey &amp; Co executive Ian Narev to head a newly created unit that will mostly lend to small to mid-sized businesses but will also be the new home for CommSec.  For years analysts have said CBA's premium business services operations should be split, arguing that the unit - which covers online trading and small business to high-end corporate financing - had become too big to focus effectively on customers.  The chief executive, Ralph Norris, acknowledged as much, saying the split 'recognises the increasing scale, diversity and importance of these businesses to the group's business mix'.  The premium business services unit delivered a 2 per cent lift in profit to $1.48 billion last year, nearly a third of group earnings. However, as CBA prepares to publish its first-half results next month, earnings are expected to come under pressure given its exposure to a clutch of struggling companies, including ABC Learning, Allco Finance and Babcock &amp; Brown.  CBA recently warned investors that provisions for bad debt could rise to as much as $2.5 billion, more than double last year's level, as credit conditions deteriorated.  The split of premium business services involves creating a unit to be known as business and corporate, which will oversee lending for small and mid-sized business, agribusiness and the CommSec operations.  Mr Narev's appointment puts him into a senior executive role at CBA after an 18-month stint as its head of strategy.  New Zealand-born Mr Narev oversaw the recent $2 billion acquisition of BankWest and the equity investment in Aussie Home Loans.  Based on recent performance, the new business and corporate unit will generate annual revenue of more than $1.7 billion, compared with about $1.9 billion for the institutional lending business.  The shake-up was triggered by the surprise exit in September of the head of premium business services, Stuart Grimshaw, who took on a role at the boutique funds manager Caledonia Investments.  CBA is expected to name a replacement to head the institutional and markets unit within the next few weeks.
