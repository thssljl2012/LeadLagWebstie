THE administrators of the failed investment firm Storm Financial have effectively shut the business down, sacking 115 staff and halting all further client transactions.  The move leaves thousands of Storm clients with an uncertain future over their investments, potentially facing losses totalling in the hundreds of millions.  At the end of 2007, Storm reported having $4.5 billion in funds under management with projections for more than $6 billion by 2008.  'The company's income had reduced very significantly over recent months, resulting in trading losses being incurred at a rate which the company could no longer absorb,' the administrators Raj Khatri and Ivor Worrell from Worrells Solvency &amp; Forensic Accountants said..  Storm Financial would no longer 'transact further business for clients', but they would introduce clients to alternative financial planners, they said.  Storm Financial is believed to have about 14,000 financial planning clients, including 3000 who had invested in Storm Financial branded products.  Most of those clients used highly leveraged margin loan facilities provided, for the most part, through the Commonwealth Bank.  By last month about 450 clients owed lenders about $30 million. That number has since fallen fell to about 300 clients owing about $20 million,  The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is investigating Storm Financial and allegations that clients were not properly informed when their accounts went into the red. At least two legal firms are considering mounting separate class actions. The first meeting of creditors will be held in Brisbane on Tuesday.  Staff manned Storm's offices around the country yesterday, including the company's recently expanded head office in Townsville, and its website was fully operational until late in the afternoon.  The company's founders, Emmanuel and Julie Cassimatis, could not be contacted.
