Our Bureau Mumbai, Sept. 22 major Lehman Brothers owes about $1 million in outstanding payments to its knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) vendor, eClerx Services. In a filing to the bourses on Monday, eClerx said that it earned about 13 per cent revenues from one of its top clients that had recently filed for a petition under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Act in a New York court. However, eClerx did not name the client. eClerx is a knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) company that provides services to clients in the manufacturing, retail and financial services space.Moreover, Barclays-, which is planning to acquire e certain operations of Lehman-, is also a client of eClerx. The client (which has filed for bankruptcy) has put us in a list of critical vendors and has recommended that our contracts get taken over by the buyer company, said Mr P.D. Mundhra, Executive Director, eClerx. However, clarity on this front will emerge only in the days to come, said Mr Mundhra.   Article E-Mail :: Comment :: Syndication ::
