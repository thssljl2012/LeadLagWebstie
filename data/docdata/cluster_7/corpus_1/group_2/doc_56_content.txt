Chemicals maker Incitec Pivot Ltd has entered into a three-year syndicated bank facility of $1.68 billion, replacing two-thirds of a bridging loan put in place to fund the company's takeover of fellow chemist Dyno Nobel.Incitec said on Thursday that lead arrangers and bookrunners for the facility were Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and Westpac Banking Corporation.Other participants are ANZ, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Citibank, Credit Suisse, HSBC, Rabobank and UBS.Incitec said all members of the syndicate were 'key relationship banks' for the company.Incitec Pivot finance director &amp;amp; chief financial officer, James Fazzino, said the new facility, achieved at competitive rates, would replace around two-thirds of a 365-day bridge loan arranged for the acquisition of Dyno Nobel.He said he was confident about the resolution of additional funding arrangements in the near future.'This will position Incitec Pivot well in terms of its future debt and equity capital needs and banking requirements,' Mr Fazzino said.Incitec acquired its 13.03 per cent holding in Dyno Nobel in August 2007.
