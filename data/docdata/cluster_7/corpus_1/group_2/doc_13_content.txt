The average rate of the governments five-year Treasury bonds (T-bonds) declined slightly to 7.089 percent during yesterdays auction from the previous rate of 7.099 percent after the auction committee made a partial award of the debt paper.During yesterdays auction, the government made a partial award of bids amounting to P2.9 billion as total tenders reached P10.69 billion.Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said the auction committee decided to do a partial award because of its comfortable cash balance.Had the auction committee awarded P7 billion worth of bids, the average rate would have gone up to 7.151 percent.However, Mendiola declined to attribute banks higher bids to the ongoing financial turmoil in the United States. Banks always try to big higher, he noted.Last week, US insurance firm American International Group (AIG) announced that it was facing a liquidity crisis while investment bank Lehman Brothers also filed for bankruptcy.Yesterdays T-bond auction is the last auction for the third quarter as Mendiola noted that the government is looking at reducing the amount of local borrowings in the fourth quarter of the year.Were thinking of reducing our borrowing. It will be lower than the borrowings in the third quarter, Mendiola said.However, he noted that there are no final figures yet.
