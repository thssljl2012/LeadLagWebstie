The Fed's failure to guarantee Lehman was a sign it had to draw the line in the sand somewhere.THE bankers have banked their million-dollar bonuses, billions in savings have been blown up and, now that the party is over the US Government is bailing out Wall Street again.In another emergency measure, the US Federal Reserve has invited investment banks to swap any "investment grade" assets they may care to dispose of into the Fed in exchange for US Treasuries.That means the Government gets the assets the banks can't sell and the banks get rock-solid government bonds that they can promptly sell and turn into cash.Not much of a penalty from the Fed for years of bull-market profligacy, especially as the Government bailed out Bear Stearns in March and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last week.However, the Bush Administration and its Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson have drawn the line at rescuing Wall Street's oldest bank, Lehman Brothers.This modicum of restraint in corporate welfare was no doubt due to the necessity to draw the line somewhere, especially as the likes of insurer AIG and savings and loan hulk Washington Mutual are also getting the wobbles, and General  and Ford both have their hands out for government largesse.The problem is that few really know a lot about Lehman's counterparty risks and obligations. What will be the knock-on effects of this bank collapsing into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection?What is the upshot for  where Lehman Brothers has a large retail exposure as a result of taking over Grange Securities two years ago? Lehman had sold roughly$2 billion worth of CDOs (collateralised debt obligations) and other fancy structured finance products to hundreds of local charities, churches, local councils, government agencies and super funds across the nation.Since the credit crisis last year, the value of these CDOs has fallen dramatically. Now, the counterparty to the transactions is headed for liquidation. What of the two-dozen councils shaping up for a class action against Lehman? Will there be anyone left to sue? What of St Vincent de Paul Society with its $9 million exposure, just to mention one case?Most CDOs were concocted by Wall Street investment banks for large fees - the same banks now receiving such largesse from the American taxpayer - but they were most often issued by a $2 company in an Atlantic tax haven. Try suing that.A further complication in this structured finance mess is that Lehman itself was often the "referenced" asset in the synthetic CDOs it liked to issue: via a Lehman CDS (credit default swap). These CDSs may not be worth much any more, if they ever were.In any case, the sale of Wall Street's confected and spliced-and-diced structured assets spread the rot around the globe. Most of us own this mess somewhere in a super fund, or at least indirectly.The situation on Wall Street is fluid, so fluid that Bank of America - which was touted along with Barclays as a potential saviour for Lehman - suddenly announced yesterday afternoon that it was buying Merrill Lynch for $US50 billion ($A61 billion).This shows just how desperate the situation is, that this proud 94-year-old brokerage dubbed "The Thundering Herd" is meekly capitulating to an offer from a retail bank. It can only suggest that it did not have much choice but to avoid Lehman's fate at all costs.While the Fed tries to bully the investment banks into setting up a fund to buy out their embattled rivals, it is clear from the Lehman experience that Wall Street banks want none of the downside. Otherwise, had the Fed guaranteed a sale of Lehman as it did for Bear Stearns, Lehman would have found a buyer.Instead, it has been left to fail after days of crisis talks between Wall Street chiefs and Fed and Treasury officials. Now there is speculation that Blackstone may manage the work-out of debts and real estate positions of Merrill and Lehman, and further speculation of other bank mergers: a tie-up between Morgan Stanley and Wachovia was cited as a possible outcome.In its release yesterday morning, the Fed said it would accept "all investment-grade securities", which presumably means anything rated above BBB. There is a lot of junk in that range. As Standard &amp;amp; Poor's, Moody's and the other agencies would - according to an  that turned up in the Securities and Exchange Commission review of ratings agencies - there will be some pretty dodgy assets swapped into the Fed for cash. Most CDOs, for example, still carry investment-grade ratings even though there are no buyers for them."The collateral for the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) also has been eligible collateral for Schedule 2 auctions will now include all investment-grade debt securities."Previously, only Treasury securities, agency securities, and AAA-rated mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities could be pledged," said the Fed release."These changes represent a significant broadening in the collateral accepted under both programs  the collateral has been broadened even as far as equities."In an emergency measure to prop up Wall Street at the time of the Bear Stearns collapse in March, the Fed had allowed banks to swap their high-rated securities for treasuries.Yesterday's announcement opens the gates right up - the swap deal not only broadened to all investment-grade debts but even as far as shares - hard on the heels of the biggest nationalisation in US history.These are dark days for global markets. Investors had better hope that it is indeed darkest before dawn.     : send photos, videos &amp;amp; tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or  us.
