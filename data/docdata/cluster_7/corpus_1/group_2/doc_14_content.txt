The exchange traded commodities were suspended after market makers lost confidence in AIG, the insurance company which has been rescued by an $85bn two-year US Government package, AIG backs 113 ETFS products.A market maker who did not want to be named said he would not be surprised if ETF Securities products did not trade again until Monday.In an earlier statement today, ETF Securities said: ETFS continues to be in close dialogue with AIG, the Exchanges and its market makers and Authorised Participants with the hope of returning to an orderly and liquid market on every Exchange as soon as possible. In its statement ETF Securities said: AIG confirmed that last night there was an announcement by the Federal Reserve Board, that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is providing a two-year, $85 billion secured revolving credit facility to AIG that will ensure the company can meet its liquidity needs.Although AIG has continued to honour all of its obligations, it is believed that market makers lost confidence in the insurer and were not prepared to be exposed to that risk. This resulted in erratic pricing with discounts to NAV emerging in early trading on Monday before the LSE suspended trading.
