 SYDNEY, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) pumped extra cash into the money market on Tuesday as risk aversion reached new extremes following the surprise rejection of the $700 billion U.S. bailout plan.With major banks around the world too scared to lend to each other, the RBA sought to ease some of the strain at home by adding A$1.95 billion ($1.56 billion) in repurchase agreements, above an estimated daily need of A$1.87 billion.The addition should further expand banks' cash cushion with the RBA, which was already at a record A$10.65 billion on Monday.Like many central banks, the RBA has been generous with liquidity in the past couple of weeks as turmoil in world markets led commercial banks to hoard cash.
