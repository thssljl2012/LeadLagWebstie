ST GEORGE Bank chief executive Paul Fegan is set to step down from his job oncompletion of the merger with Westpac. He is likely to leave the combined bank within a few months of the $18 billion deal being sealed in November.Mr Fegan's departure is widely expected after the decision of the St George board to support the revised terms of its tie-up with Westpac, which now needs only the backing of the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, and the formal approval of the Dragon's shareholders.Mr Fegan has spent the five months since the merger was announced ensuring that Australia's fifth largest bank remained focused on delivering on its promise of 8-10 per cent earnings growth in what will be its last year as an independent institution.While St George again re-affirmed its unanimous backing on Monday for the share swap merger terms of 1.31 Westpac shares for every St George share, Mr Fegan has insisted his bank should not be distracted from its business as a stand-alone organisation before it is swallowed by its bigger rival.The three big tests of Mr Fegan's operational plan have been satisfied by the ASX announcements over the past four weeks: Confirmation that it will turn in earnings growth of between 8 and 10 per cent for the year ending September 30, which should guarantee a net record profit of $1.32 billion; That it has already completed 40 per cent of its 2009 funding needs of $12 billion, despite the financing pressures resulting from the global credit crisis; and That it will pay out almost all of its profit growth this year amounting to about $160 million in a special one-off dividend to its shareholders before Westpac gets control of its finances.The position of Mr Fegan has been a focus of much debate since the merger with Westpac was unveiled in May.He was never a contender for the top job of chief executive of the combined group, as that was filled from day one by his former boss and former St George chief executive, Gail Kelly, who formally took on the role of Westpac chief executive on February 1.And while Mrs Kelly has indicated that the retail banking operations of St George will be run independently under the multi-brand business being planned by Westpac, it has been clear from the start that Mr Fegan is not interested in managing a slimmed-down version of his bank as a subsidiary.The Herald understands that Mr Fegan will stay on for a short time with the merged group to ensure a smooth handover following the expected agreement by the Dragon's shareholders.That will cap his only year in charge of St George since his appointment to the chief executive's job following Mrs Kelly's defection to Westpac in August last year.Mr Fegan was unavailable for comment yesterday as he is on an investor tour to New York and London.
