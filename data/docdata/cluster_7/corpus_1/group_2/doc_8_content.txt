The Queensland Government says it is being cautious with investments during the current market turmoil.American investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed earlier this week, while insurance giant AIG was rescued by the US Federal Reserve today.The Treasurer, Andrew Fraser, says Queensland has about $400 million tied up in Lehman Brothers and AIG, but he says that is a relatively small part of the state's investments. 'Obviously this is an hour-by-hour proposition in many ways,' he said. 'Everyone is making sure that we adopt very conservative strategies, that we are being very careful about where investments are at this point in time. But State Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg has told an Australian Industry Group function in Brisbane that there is still too much reliance on the resources sector. 'We do have a diverse economy, but it's not diverse enough,' he said.
