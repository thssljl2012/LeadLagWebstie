LONG-TERM credit markets are freezing over again and the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers is causing havoc in credit derivatives markets, potentially squeezing Australian banks' margins.In just four days, huge changes to the financial landscape have occurred, including Lehman Brother's bankruptcy and the sale of Merrill Lynch.Collectively, Australia's five biggest banks have exposure to Lehman Brothers of about $410 million, and secondary 'counterparty risk' through credit derivative contracts that may have involved Lehman Brothers.The vulnerability of insurer American International Group  despite the US Federal Reserve's $US85 billion ($A107 billion) heroics yesterday has also intensified the so-called credit crunch.ABN Amro's head of debt capital markets, Peter Block, said no long-term debt had been issued in the past few days.'These events rival anything any of us have ever seen in our business lives,' he said. 'We can expected continued instability.'Goldman Sachs JBWere analyst James Freeman said 'secondary impacts'  including exposures to counterparties, rising bad debts and a crisis of market confidence  were of greater concern.However, Mr Block said the Reserve Bank of Australia was injecting liquidity and banks were still lending short-term funds to each other. The yield on three-month Australian bank bills was 7.25% yesterday, just a quarter percentage point above the official cash rate.Macquarie analyst Tom Quarmby said Australia's five major banks were taking advantage of cheaper short-term debt, making it a bigger proportion of overall funding. On average, Commonwealth Bank, ANZ, Westpac, National Australia Bank and St George are now seeking about 15.8% of their funding in long-term wholesale markets, down from 17% less than a year ago. The percentage of short-term funding has jumped from 26.8% to 29.4%.But while all Australian banks are ahead in their capital-raising programs, analysts said an increase in long-term funding costs was likely to hit margins, and therefore the banks' ability to reduce standard variable rates.'We expect banks will not pass on the entire amount of further cuts to the official cash rate,' said Mr Quarmby and colleagues in a research report.'Look for the banks to retain five to 10 basis points on their standard variable mortgage rates if the cash rate is reduced by 25 basis points in October.'
