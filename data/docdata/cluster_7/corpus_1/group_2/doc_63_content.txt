LONDON -- J.P. Morgan downgraded U.K. banks Barclays , Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB to underweight from neutral, saying the three combined are still facing a capital shortage of 38 billion pounds ($70 billion). The broker also slashed its target price for all three banks and cut earnings estimates for the sector by 39% in 2009. It added that Lloyds TSB's planned acquisition of HBOS isn't in the best interests of shareholders and that lost revenue from the overlap between the businesses will outpace cost savings. On RBS, J.P. Morgan said it doesn't believe savings from the ABN Amro acquisition are feasible and it added Barclays' reliance on investment banking is a worry and makes its economic profit target look unattainable.Copyright
