LONDON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - British bank Lloyds TSB (News/Aktienkurs) moved to sell shares worth over 800 million pounds ($1.5 billion) on Friday after bank stocks surged a day after it agreed a 12 billion-pound takeover of rival HBOS. Lloyds said it was immediately placing up to 5 percent of its shares in issue. That could see up to 284 million shares placed, according to Reuters data. By 1433 GMT the Lloyds share price was up 25 percent at 297 pence, which would see up to 843 million pounds raised, although shares are typically sold in a placing at a slight discount. The accelerated bookbuild is due to close at 1700 GMT. Lloyds agreed an all-share deal to rescue HBOS on Thursday, after its rival's shares were battered in the past week by fears about its funding position. The deal will weaken Lloyds' capital position, and Lloyds said the placing would allow it to strengthen its capital and 'support the development of our business strategies.' The placing is being managed by Citigroup and Merrill Lynch.
