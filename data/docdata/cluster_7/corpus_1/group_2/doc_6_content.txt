Three major mortgage lenders have hiked their rates, signalling an end to the recent trend of falls in the cost of home loans.HSBC, Barclays's lending arm the Woolwich and internet and telephone bank First Direct all said they are passing on recent increases in the cost of borrowing to customers.The move brings to an end the most prolonged period of falling mortgage rates since the credit crunch first struck.Rates had been steadily falling since July, helping push the average cost of a two-year fixed-rate mortgage down to its pre-credit crunch level, as lenders once again competed for business.But wholesale funding costs have soared during the past week following the recent financial turmoil.Two-year swap rates, upon which fixed rate deals are based, have increased from 5.18% last week to 5.56% on Thursday.At the same time the three-month Libor rate, which affects the pricing of tracker mortgages, has soared from a recent low of 5.7% to nearly 6.28% - the highest level since December last year, and the biggest differential to the Bank of England base rate since September.Last week specialist lender GE Money, which lends under the First National and iGroup brands, announced rises of up to 1.6%, while smaller players, such as Yorkshire Building Society, have also increased the cost of some of their deals.Now that some of the major players have also increased their rates, other lenders are expected to follow suit in the coming days.But on a brighter note, Britannia announced it had cut the cost of its two and 10-year fixed rate mortgages and some of its tracker products by up to 0.3%.Editor's ChoiceNEW poems from some of Stroud's finest wordsmiths will accompany this year's Stroud Water Textile Festival.DJ JAGDISH Patel is one of Stroud FM's new radio presenters.WHY is it that three quintessentially English roles have gone to a couple of Americans and one Australian? Having just won two substantial Oscars this year it must be plain for any idiot to see that Britain has talent. So when this film's director Justin Chadwick says they were just perfect for the roles because 'they're great actors', it sticks in my craw. Though it is fair to say the Australian Cate Blanchett did a fine job as Queen Elizabeth I, I still think that it is insulting to Americans to assume they would be unable to cope with an unknown name in the lead, but it is an even greater insult to us. We have a treasure trove of talent in this country that is struggling to get noticed in a profession in which 88% are out of work. But we also have a myriad of big names as well, so shame on you Mr. Chadwick.SET in the early 1980s this film is based on the true story of hard drinking womaniser Charlie Wilson, who also had a penchant for coke. He was the liberal Democrat congressman from Texas said to have been totally responsible for organising the biggest undercover operation in the history of the United States. This involved supplying the Afghan Mujahideen with arms during the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the success of which unfortunately was the beginning of a very tricky future for the Afghan nation.
