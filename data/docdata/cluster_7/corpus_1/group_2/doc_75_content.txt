In August, net mortgage lending rose only by 2.1 billion; less than half the average rise over the previous six months. The number of approvals for house purchase was again very low and those for remortgaging also fell. Consumer credit rose by 0.4bn in August, slightly above the previous 6 month average of 0.3bn. Personal deposit growth continued to be weak and the annual growth rate declined by 0.7% to 4.0%.Table containing August 2008 figuresseasonally adjusted datamortgage lendingconsumer creditpersonal depositscompany financeAugust net change+ 2.1 bn+ 0.4 bn+ 0.2 bn+ 8.5 bn(previous month)+ 4.8 bn+ 0.1 bn- 0.1 bn+ 18.2 bnprevious six month average+ 4.7 bn+ 0.3 bn+ 2.2 bn+ 14.8 bnannual growth+ 11.4 %+ 3.6 %+ 4.0 %+ 26.2 %amounts outstanding nsa537.4 bn109.2 bn570.0 bn774.2 bnBBA statistics director, David Dooks, said of the latest data:'The low number of mortgage approvals in previous months predicted lower gross lending in August and, together with remortgaging, a much weaker net lending figure than of late resulted. Falling property prices, economic pressures on households, tighter lending criteria and anticipation of the Government's announcement on stamp duty all suppressed or delayed demand in August and will continue having an impact in the months ahead.Monthly fluctuations in consumer credit and deposits reflect the behaviour of families repaying as much as they spend on credit cards and using their current accounts for expenditure.'The full press release can be downloaded from the PDF link below.For further information, please contact:Brian Capon (020 7216 8810 brian.capon@bba.org.uk )David Dooks (020 7216 8837 david.dooks@bba.org.uk )Notes to Editors:The BBA is the leading UK banking and financial services trade association and represents its members, from 60 countries, on domestic and international issues.
