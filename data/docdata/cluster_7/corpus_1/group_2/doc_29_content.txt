Independent expert Grant Samuel says the current upheaval in global financial markets makes it 'extremely difficult' to make short-term estimates of the key value drivers for takeover target St George Ltd.The bank's board has recommended a $17 billion offer for the institution by Westpac Banking Corporation and it was revealed earlier this month that the independent expert had determined that the offer was fair and reasonable.According to a full copy of Grant Samuel's assessment, released Monday, the expert said estimating key value drivers such as underlying levels of asset growth, funding costs and net interest margins 'with any degree of reliability' was difficult.Further uncertainty exists over Australian banks accessing sufficient wholesale funding to replace maturing lines of wholesale funding, and their ability to meet asset growth requirements, Grant Samuel added.Grant Samuel has assessed St George's current valuation at between $30.13 and $33.40 per share based on an estimated market value of Westpac's shares of between $23.00 and $25.50.While the bottom end of the value of the consideration is slightly below the bottom end of the value range for St George, it is the range rather than an individual price that is relevant, Grant Samuel said.'There is a very substantial degree of overlap and over 85 per cent of the value range for the consideration falls within the St George valuation range,' Grant Samuel said.'Accordingly, the Westpac proposal is 'fair' and therefore 'reasonable'.'Westpac's shares Monday fell by 3.46 per cent, or 3.46 per cent, to finish at $23.15, while St George's shares closed 2.54 per cent lower at $30.70.The expert opinion is included in a scheme booklet to be sent to St George shareholders in mid October ahead of a vote on the merger proposal in Sydney on November 13.Under Westpac's offer, St George shareholders will receive 1.31 Westpac shares for each St George share they own, a 97 cent final dividend for the year to September 30, 2008, and a special dividend of up to $1.25 per St George share.In the absence of the Westpac takeover bid, St George's share price would have fallen in line with the recent rerating of the sector, and probably by at least as much as Westpac's share price, Grant Samuel said, adding that this rendered the takeover premium still intact.A stand-alone St George would currently be trading at less than $25.00, the expert added.Grant Samuel thinks if wholesale credit markets remain frozen, the flow through of incremental funding costs will impact St George's earnings growth relative to the major banks.As well, the likelihood of another party making a superior bid is relatively low, the expert said.The bank's board has unanimously recommended shareholders approve the deal, which, if successful, will lead to the biggest takeover in Australian banking history.
