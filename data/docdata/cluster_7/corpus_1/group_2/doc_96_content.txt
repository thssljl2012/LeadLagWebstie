The ban took place with immediate effect.The Sunday Telegraph and the Mail on Sunday have both reported that the group of hedge funds - none of which has been named - wants to be compensated for the losses they have incurred as a direct result of the ban.The FSA responded by saying it did not know of any forthcoming legal action: 'We're not aware of any legal challenge. We're clear that the new code provisions are both valid and necessary,' an FSA spokesperson said.Short-selling, is a form of speculation in which an investor sells borrowed shares. If the share price drops, the investor buys the shares back at a lower price and pockets the difference. Short-selling has been widely blamed for the share fall in HBOS' share price, which resulted in the bank needing to be rescued by Lloyds TSB, even though it was solvent.
