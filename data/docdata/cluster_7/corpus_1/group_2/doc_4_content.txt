New Zealand's market is breathing a sigh of relief as world markets take stock after Tuesday's financial turmoil. New Zealand's markets bounced back a bit on Wednesday after plummeting nearly 3% and local consumers have felt one of the few benefits to come from the slowing global economy with petrol prices the lowest in 17 weeks. 'The drivers for the increase in oil prices have been demand and a rapidly growing world economy. And we are seeing that world economy slowing down and we are seeing weaker economies particularly in the US...and that is having an effect,' says Mike Noon from the Automobile Association.Petrol has now fallen more than 10% since July's high of $2.19 while diesel has dropped by 16%. 'I don't think we're in the same market that we were in earlier this year with those amazing increases which hurt everyone so much,' says Noon. There is also cautious relief on the NZ sharemarket. 'We're seeing oil come back, we're seeing interest rates come back, we're seeing local stimulation as far as tax is concerned in our market so there are some good news aspects at the moment...but we do want to make sure that this credit issue is the main one that's cleaned up over the upcoming weeks,' says Gretchen Hanley from ABN Amro.In the United States the Federal Reserve Bank has bailed out insurance giant AIG, easing concern about the future for the 220 staff at New Zealand's AIG General and Life subsidiaries. 'If AIG the main company were to collapse...I think they would be purchased by another NZ-based company or a company wishing to enter the market here,' says Investment Savings &amp;amp; Insurance Association spokesman Vance Arkinstall. 'In the event of claims there are reinsurers who are actually sharing part of the risks.' Now all eyes are back on world markets to see if, or when, more carnage will come and how closely New Zealand will be to the fall-out.
