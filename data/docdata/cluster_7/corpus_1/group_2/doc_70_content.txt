THERE are few signs of it yet, but the credit crunch will begin to bite sooner or later.While its impact is inevitable, there is less certainty, and a very real danger in speculating, about how big  or small  the impact will be or indeed when it will reach here.And Treasury Minister Allan Bell remains confident that the Manx economy will weather the storm and could even emerge in a stronger position.As anxious staff at Bank of Scotland International and Clerical Medical wait to find out what the job implications will be of the Lloyds TSB takeover of HBOS, Mr Bell says it's unrealistic to expect we will not be affected by the increasing turmoil in the global money markets.He says there is every reason to remain positive with the latest national income figures showing net economic growth of well over eight per cent  making the Isle of Man one of the fastest growing economies in Europe.These figures are, however, 18 months old and cover the year ending March 2007.Unemployment remained virtually unchanged in August at just 1.4 per cent of the economically active population, bank deposits are healthy, there's more diversity in the finance sector, less dependence on the UK economy and the zero/10 tax policy has attracted new investment and helped us steal a march on our competitors.But Mr Bell warned: 'The Isle of Man is likely to slow down next year, things will be difficult.'Clearly the events of the last few days have taken the world financial situation into new territory and there is a danger in speculating on how that might impact on the Isle of Man in the future.'We will come out of this crisis eventually and the Isle of Man should be in a stronger position.'And insisting the Island should not talk itself into recession, he added: 'The task we face is to minimise the negative.'Chris Corlett, chief executive of the Department of Trade and Industry, said: 'There will be an impact. I suspect the impact will affect us in many and varied ways we have yet to understand.'The global economy is a vast, diverse beast. While certain facets may be adversely affected that doesn't mean all areas will be. With the Isle of Man being very small it's far easier to buck global trends.'Mr Corlett stressed that the Island was no longer dependent on single sectors as it had been in the past  agriculture and tourism  and even in sectors such as financial services there had been great diversification.Where once there was just saving banks, life and pensions, the Island has in the past decade seen a massive growth in corporate service providers, financial management and niche legal accountancy targeting the super-rich.He said financial services in the Isle of Man were relatively well-placed to weather the global economic storm.But he said it was too early to say what the fall-out would be of any Lloyds TSB takeover of HBOS.'These deals are done at the corporate level, the implications for subsidiaries are not known for many months if not years.'Manufacturing, too, has seen massive growth  37.8 per cent in the past four years, actually outstripping growth across sectors  and Mr Corlett believes these specialist industries such as laser optics, oil and gas valves, and aircraft components will see no decline in their markets.Niche services such as the aircraft and marine registers had also fared well and more growth in e-gaming was expected.'I'm not going to say everything is perfect because that would be complacent. But the fundamentals of our economy remain strong. It is more interconnected that it's ever been. You have to look at the global economy which as well as presenting threats does present advantages.'The Isle of Man can do very well by taking a small market share of a very big sector. The beauty of being small can be its advantage.'------------HOW IS THE CREDIT CRUNCH AFFECTING YOU?
