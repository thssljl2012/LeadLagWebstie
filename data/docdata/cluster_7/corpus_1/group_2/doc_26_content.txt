NATIONAL Australia Bank is facing renewed pressure to make at least $500 million in fresh write-downs against a portfolio of complex credit instruments as it prepares to rule off its accounts later this month.The move follows continued deterioration in global credit markets and fresh concerns that corporate loans globally could start to turn bad.Any further losses  which analysts say could blow out to as much as $1 billion  are likely to raise doubts over institutional banking boss John Hooper remaining in the role as Cameron Clyne prepares to take charge as chief executive next year.NAB has already flagged write-downs of some $830 million on holdings of asset-backed securities linked to the US housing market. The provisions, which cover its entire exposure to the troubled US housing market, come on top of a $181 million collective provision already raised against holdings of collateralised debt obligations in the first half.Focus has switched to what remains in NAB's conduit entities, particularly a $4.5 billion vehicle of corporate and infrastructure-backed securities.Included in this are about $1.6 billion of collateralised debt obligations that have exposures to European and US corporate names through traded instruments known as credit default swaps.Elsewhere there are some $831 million in exposure to European-based commercial property.NAB's conduits were initially set up to give its clients access to global capital markets through off-balance-sheet vehicles. Since the US subprime meltdown, there has been little investor appetite for the underlying assets.Adding to concerns over the health of NAB's portfolio, US lending giant Bank of America this week warned that credit weakness had started to spread from residential customers to US corporate borrowers.Citigroup analyst Craig Williams expects NAB could soon be forced to detail write-downs of between $500 million and $1 billion, mostly as a result of the market falling away for the collateralised debt obligations.'While the underlying positions may hold up, the dramatic deterioration in the market value of these instruments may force NAB's hand in making an impairment adjustment,' Mr Williams said.NAB shares slumped 4.8% to $23.88, leading a broader selldown among banking stocks.At the time of making write-downs against its US housing exposures, NAB said 'no material provisions' were required against the remaining conduit assets.A spokeswoman yesterday said NAB had made the 'appropriate provisions' against its conduits based on the review and the bank would continue to keep the market fully informed.Still, EL &amp;amp; C Baillieu told clients NAB's auditors or the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority could pressure for a top-up in provisions.'It is possible that depending on market conditions, NAB may choose or be forced to take further provisions on the non-residential assets,' EL &amp;amp; C Baillieu said in a briefing note.Mr Hooper stepped into the institutional banking role four years ago after the management purge that followed its foreign exchange trading scandal.Thought to be close to CEO John Stewart, the British-born Mr Hooper had a mandate to cut the risk on the balance sheet, overhaul the institutional bank's troubled culture and close out underweight positions operations in Asia.Other banks are regarded as having limited exposure to outside-purchased conduit assets.
