NEW YORK, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The cost to insure the debt of banks and brokers jumped on Monday after Lehman Brothers Holdings filed for bankruptcy, Barclays said. Credit default swaps on brokers are around 50 basis points to 100 basis points wider, while banks are 25 basis points wider, Barclays (nyse: BCS - news - people ) analysts said in a report. 'We expect liquidity to be extremely thin,' they added. 'The weekend's developments have substantially increased the market's systemic risk premia.'  tf.TFN-Europe_newsdesk@thomsonreuters.comcmr   Thomson Financial News Limited 2007.
