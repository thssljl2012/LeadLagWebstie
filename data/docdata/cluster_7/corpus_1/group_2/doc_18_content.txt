SAN FRANCISCO -- Moody's Investors Service said Thursday it placed Lloyds TSB and HBOS long-term ratings on review for possible downgrade on their planned merger. Both of their Prime-1 short term ratings were affirmed. The ratings agency believes the merger of two large financial institutions will face challenges given the difficult conditions in the global financial markets and the deteriorating economic environment in the U.K. During the review, Moody's will focus on several things, including the capital strength of the combined group, cost and revenue synergies, and quality of the joint loan books. Earlier Thursday, Lloyds said it will buy HBOS for 12.2 billion pounds ($22.2 billion) in a deal backed by British authorities.Copyright
