Car insurer Progressive Corp. saw the value of its assets decline nearly $325 million earlier this week, primarily because of big holdings in federally backed mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The Mayfield company said that because of the decline in value of its investment portfolio, it lost $135.2 million, or 20 cents a share, in August, compared with a profit of $76.9 million, or 11 cents a share, during the same month last year.Progressive disclosed the numbers in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and in its monthly results report.Progressive held more than $278 million in Fannie and Freddie stock. On Sunday, the federal government took over the two troubled mortgage underwriting companies, a move that essentially wiped out the value of the companies' shares. The decline in value wipes out about 7.6 percent of the stock holdings Progressive had at the end of June.Until a little more than a year ago, investors considered Fannie and Freddie stock to be among the safest investments on Wall Street, making it a favorite of risk-averse institutional investors such as insurance companies. That has changed with the nationwide collapse of much of the mortgage industry.
