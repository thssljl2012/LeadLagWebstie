On Tuesday the Reserve Bank of India joined the global rescue act mounted by central banks across the world. Unlike the US Fed which is in the ignominious position of having to bail out one financial institution after another, the latest being insurance giant AIG, RBIs rescue act was far less drastic. It is aimed at addressing liquidity fears. Thus banks in need of funds will be allowed to borrow more from the RBI, if necessary by holding less than the mandated 25% of deposits that banks need to hold in approved (primarily government) securities, or SLR (statutory liquidity ratio). Banks will also be given temporary access to additional funds through a second LAF (liquidity adjustment facility) auction. At the same time, in a bid to check downward pressure on the rupee that ended Tuesday at 46.93 to the dollar, it assured market players it would ensure adequate supply of dollars. Its move to raise the interest ceiling on non-resident deposits, both rupee and dollar-denominated is of a piece with this since higher rates will increase inflows from non-residents. On paper, its multi-pronged attack has the right touch, aimed at calming frazzled nerves without going overboard. But whether it will have to be followed up with more aggressive steps (a cut in interest rates a la the Peoples Bank of China) remains to be seen. Much will depend on whether the US governments bid to contain the ongoing financial tsunami succeeds. The decision to shore up AIG by agreeing to lend up to $85 billion in emergency funds in return for a stake of 79.9% and effective control of the worlds largest insurer is a marked departure from the hands-off approach to Sundays collapse of Lehman Bros. But then the US administration had no choice. Whether this will reduce already significant levels of financial market fragility and ward off materially weaker US economic performance remains to be seen. The Fed is clearly hopeful, which is why it held the Fed funds rate (indicative overnight interbank rate) unchanged at 2% in its meeting on Tuesday. Unfortunately, it has been wrong-footed before. For the moment, then, the RBI will have to wait and watch.
