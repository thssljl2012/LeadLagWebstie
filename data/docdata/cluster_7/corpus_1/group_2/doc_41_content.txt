SYDNEY, Sept 25 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB.AX: Quote, Profile, Research), the nation's top lender, may seek to offload its A$1 billion ($833 million) exposure in U.S. property markets under the U.S. government's planned $700 billion financial rescue package, The Australian newspaper said on Thursday.Earlier this year, NAB wrote off about A$1 billion due to its exposure to distressed U.S. mortgage backed securities, the highest by any Australian bank. 'We will take advantage of any opportunities there are, but we couldn't give any guidance to anyone about it at the moment,' the paper quoted a NAB spokesman as saying.The financial rescue package, which is being discussed by the U.S. Congress, will be open to non-U.S. institutions, the report said.It said the increasingly global nature of the crisis was underlined on Wednesday with the Reserve Bank of Australia entering into a $10 billion deal with the U.S. Federal Reserve to supply U.S. currency to banks operating in Australia.
