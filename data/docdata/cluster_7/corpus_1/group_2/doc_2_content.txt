Key issues examined by this report... - Subprime crisis. The US credit crunch caused by mortgage-backed securities led to increased provision for credit losses and higher net charge-offs. This affected the retail operations earnings of many leading banks in the US and Europe in 2007. - US credit card debt. In the aftermath of the US mortgage crisis, credit card debt in the US rose to unprecedented levels. A slowing of the mortgage expansion rate has resulted in a substantial shift to credit card borrowing from mortgage debt.        - Cross-border banking consolidation. Cross-border consolidation gained a new momentum following the recent $100bn acquisition of ABN AMRO by a consortium of European banks led by RBS.        - Rising interest rates. High interest rates combined with lower growth rates will adversely affect the demand for retail and corporate credit and also decrease the interest spreads, which in turn, will negatively impact on banks' profitability.
