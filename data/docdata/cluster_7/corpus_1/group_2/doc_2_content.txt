(RTTNews) - The U.S. Federal Reserve announced Tuesday that it has decided to hold short-term borrowing rates steady, ignoring calls for an interest rate cut that were prompted by the latest Wall Street turmoil. While recent signs of strain in the financial markets encouraged speculation that the Fed might lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, the central bank chose to stay the course for now.This included a reiteration of its concern about inflation, a surprise to many market experts, who had expected the Fed to back away from this rhetoric. The vote among Fed policy-makers was unanimous, the first decision made without a dissenting vote in nearly a year.The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making arm, announced that it has decided to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent. This followed similar decisions in June and August, as the Fed has held rates steady following the sharp cuts that took place earlier in the year.Expectations that the Fed might cut rates had built up over the past few days, as the collapse of some well-known financial firms led to a Wall Street selling spree on Monday.Tuesday's rate decision came with the approval of all 10 participating members of the FOMC, the first unanimous vote on rates since September of last year. Notably silent in the dissenting column was Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher, who had voted against the previous 5 rate decisions. Fisher had wanted higher rates to keep inflation in check.In the policy statement that accompanied the rate decision, the Fed acknowledged increased 'strains' in the financial markets lately and predicted that growth will be weighed down in the next few quarters by tight conditions in the credit markets, the continued decline in the housing industry, and some slowing of export growth.Despite this outlook, the Fed stated that moderate economic growth would be supported by the rate cuts it made earlier in the year, along with efforts it has made to provide liquidity to the financial markets.Meanwhile, the Fed stated that the outlook for inflation remains 'highly uncertain,' though it predicted that high inflation would likely moderate later this year and next year. This repeated the stepped-up anti-inflation rhetoric that it added to its policy statement in August.Many had expected the central bank to shift its ground somewhat in the wake of the recent financial crisis, moving away from fighting inflation and the implication of a possible rate hike to a view more aimed at stimulating the economy. This went as far as some economists predicting that the Fed could cut its benchmark rate by as much as a half of a percentage point.Stocks tumbled on Monday, dragged down by news that legendary Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers (LEH) had filed for bankruptcy and that rival Merrill Lynch (MER) had been forced into a hurried merger deal with Bank of America (BAC). The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 500 points, in the worst single-session performance since the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks in 2001.Markets remained fragile on Tuesday amid uncertainty about the future of insurance giant AIG (AIG), which likely will have to secure funds by the end of the day in order to avoid its own bankruptcy filing.This apparent instability in the financial markets, combined with signs of moderating inflation, convinced many that the Fed would at least start setting the stage for a rate cut down the line. A decline in energy prices seemed to take the pressure off inflation, and the crisis on Wall Street made further economic weakness seem like a more acute problem.Consumer price data released earlier on Tuesday helped underline the easing inflation concerns. A Labor Department report said consumer prices edged down 0.1 percent in August after jumping 0.8 percent increase in July. Energy prices were down 3.1 percent in the month, coming back after notable increases in the previous 3 months.Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy sectors, rose a modest 0.2 percent in August, slowing down from the 0.3 percent rate of growth seen in July.This tame inflation statistics, combined with the financial crisis of the past few days, fueled speculation of a rate cut.The debate over interest rates comes amid a broader discussion of what the government's role in the markets should be. Over the weekend, the Federal Reserve was among the government regulators that allowed Lehman Brothers to declare bankruptcy after earlier this year helping to broker the sale of Bear Stearns to JP Morgan (JPM).Experts have pointed out that the situations at the two firms were qualitatively different - Lehman suffered a solvency issue, while Bear Stearns was merely facing a liquidity crisis brought on by what has been described as a classic 'run on the bank.' Meanwhile, insurance giant AIG was teetering on the edge of its own bankruptcy filing as the Fed announced its rate decision, with regulators trying to decide whether that company should receive a bailout.While it did not intervene to prevent Lehman's collapse, the Fed still took steps over the weekend to help protect the general market from the ripple effect of the bankruptcy.As part of these efforts, the central bank broadened the collateral that can be pledged for its Primary Dealer Credit Facility, a loan facility created in response to the subprime mortgage crisis that allows primary dealers to borrow money from the Fed's discount window.The Fed also expanded the collateral for its Term Securities Lending Facility, a loan facility that was inaugurated during the recent financial crisis in an attempt to promote liquidity and support the functioning of the financial markets.This collateral for this lending facility will now include all investment-grade debt securities, the Fed announced. Previously this facility only accepted Treasury securities, agency securities, and AAA-rated mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities - basically only the safest securities.
