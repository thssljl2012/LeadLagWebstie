 National City Corp.Wachovia By ARIELLE KASS1:33 pm, September 29, 2008The stock of National City Corp. lost more than 60% of its market value Monday as yet another major troubled bank met its demise in a forced sale to a larger rival.National City's shares finished the day at $1.36, down 63% from last Friday's closing price of $3.71. The stock hit an intraday low of $1.25 earlier in the day.Despite the latest pummeling of the company's stock, National City spokeswoman Kristen Baird Adams said the Cleveland-based bank is different from Wachovia - the bank operations of which Citigroup has agreed to buy - and Washington Mutual, which last Thursday was purchased by JPMorgan Chase. National City's stock also took a beating last Friday after the WaMu announcement.Ms. Baird Adams said deposit inflows remain strong and the bank's liquidity is "ample." She said National City is still $7 billion in excess of its capital requirements, the same amount of money that was raised in a deal with private equity firm Corsair Capital and other investors in April."We certainly recognize the volatility and fear in the market, but we're quite confident," Ms. Baird Adams said. "We acted early and decisively to raise substantial capital." Avoiding Wachovia's problemMs. Baird Adams emphasized that National City has no option-adjustable rate mortgages, which she called among the riskiest mortgages, saying that Washington Mutual had about $52 billion of exposure and Wachovia $122 billion to such loans.She said National City does have a number of liquidating loan portfolios for business that the bank has exited. Those include mortgages originated through brokers and indirect auto, marina and RV loans. All told, the liquidating portfolios house between $17 billion and $20 billion.Ms. Baird Adams said just 10% of those loans would be considered troubled."By and large, the vast majority of those loans are performing quite well," she said.Ms. Baird Adams also said the bank has no exposure in California, where Wachovia was hit hardest. Analysts see Nat City in different boatHer comments, she said, have been reiterated by several analysts who since Friday have emphasized National City's stable capital position and the bank's aggressiveness in recognizing its non-performing loans.In the past week, Goldman Sachs has raised National City's rating to "buy," Fox-Pitt Kelton has brought it to "outperform," Citi called it a top pick and a very compelling buying opportunity and Barclays Capital initiated coverage, putting the bank's target price at $8 a share.Several analysts specifically said National City is not the next Washington Mutual."Many distinctions can be made between WM and NCC, most importantly that NCC is much better capitalized, better reserved, less exposed to residential real estate," Bernstein Research analyst Kevin St. Pierre wrote. "To date, NCC has shown no signs whatsoever of a flight in deposits."Oppenheimer analyst Terry McEvoy echoed the same thought."We spoke with a number of National City's competitors and not one suggested that they are seeing an inflow of new customers coming from National City," he wrote. "Management on Friday mentioned that deposit inflows have been strong throughout the quarter and it was business as usual in the branches."
