AUSTRALIA'S second biggest bank, Westpac, has spoken out against the business community to urge the Federal Government to pursue a strict emissions trading scheme with tougher reporting standards for business.In a submission to the Government, obtained by the Herald, Westpac warns against handouts for companies seeking to shelter themselves from the full force of the scheme. 'Utmost care must be exercised that compensation measures do not undermine the integrity of the scheme or alleviate the impact of the introduction of a carbon market,' says the submission, one of hundreds received by the Government in response to its green paper on the design of the scheme.The Australian Food and Grocery Council will today release its submission calling for bigger concessions for energy-intense, trade-exposed industries, including tariffs on imports from countries with less stringent environmental regimes.Amid the clamour for relief, Westpac has urged the Government to stick to its guns. 'The market must be allowed to function effectively, without overt interference from buffering policy mechanisms or overly generous compensation allocations which distort the market  [or] provide market participants with the means of avoiding the medium to long-term behavioural change intended by the introduction of a price on carbon.' The position is in stark contrast to the Business Council of Australia, which represents the country's top 100 companies. It has issued dire warnings of multiple bankruptcies under the scheme because proposed levels of compensation are 'not sufficient'. Westpac is a member of the council but has fallen out in the past over the council's reluctance under the former mining boss Hugh Morgan to state an early position on climate change.Westpac's former chief executive David Morgan, who is married to the former Labor environment minister Ros Kelly, was a driving force in establishing the Australian Business Roundtable on Climate Change in 2004 after frustration with the council over policy.Westpac's submission offers strong support for an emissions trading scheme. 'Doing nothing is not an option. Failure to implement an effective response to the challenges posed by climate change will endanger Australia's future economic prosperity,' it says. In an attempt to limit special case pleading by industry, Westpac proposes the process by which a company is deemed 'energy-intense and trade-exposed' - and therefore forced to participate in the scheme - be subject to regular review and determined five years in advance.
