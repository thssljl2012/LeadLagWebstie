And the events which have been unfolding across the pond prove it still holds true. Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest investment bank on Wall Street. It survived the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. On Monday, it became the biggest bankruptcy in history.On top of that, there was an emergency takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America for about 50bn. And insurance giant AIG went cap in hand to the Federal Reserve, asking to borrow as much as 40bn.So, how will this affect the UK economy? For starters, our economy will be hit as bankers lose jobs and confidence suffers. And the mortgage market could be hit as well.In recent weeks, we had seen tentative signs of a revival, with rate cuts on some mortgages. We will now see that trend go into reverse as lenders once again find it harder to raise finance.So what about our savings? Thanks to this credit freeze, The banks will remain hungry for savings deposits.This means savers should still be able to take advantage of rates topping 6%, particularly on fixed-rate bonds.However, over the longer term, savings rates will fall as the Bank of England is likely to start cutting interest rates quicker than expected as inflation falls and the economy needs stimulating.Although it is highly unlikely that the UK Government would allow a major British bank to fail, it is vital that you save prudently and ensure your bank or building society is covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.Under the FSCS the first 35,000 invested (70,000 for joint accounts) in any one institution is protected.But savers should be aware that some banks and building societies share a licence. For example, the Bank of Scotland, Birmingham Midshires, Halifax, Saga and Intelligent Finance are part of the same group and share a licence.Consequently, if a customer's money is split between two or more of these organisations, he or she would be eligible for only one lot of compensation.All the UK high street banks are members of the scheme and many, but not all, foreign banks offering savings accounts in the UK are also covered.In regard to pensions, falling stock markets are affecting the majority of people in pension schemes. Schemes fall into two categories: defined benefit and money purchase.A defined benefit scheme is where your employer promises to pay a percentage of your final salary as a pension, regardless of stock market performance.Therefore, any fall in the value of the scheme's assets will result in the employer having to make up the shortfall.The worry here is that large deficits will encourage the few remaining employers offering these schemes to close them and replace them with money purchase alternatives. This is where the level of pension available at retirement is determined purely by the size of the fund and its performance up to retirement.These schemes typically include stakeholder pensions and group personal pensions and any fall in the value of the investments held by the scheme would impact directly on the member. Anyone approaching retirement could be looking at a less comfortable one.In terms of investments, those people who hold shares either directly or via Individual Savings Accounts will have seen values fall significantly.Assuming you take a longer term view (five to 10 years) this is not such a problem as it is likely that markets will eventually recover.History shows that this is always the case but market timing is impossible to predict.However, anyone who needs to realise assets now for a specific purpose - for example to help fund a move into retirement or due to a change in their personal circumstances, will be left looking at substantial losses on their share portfolio.In summary, it has been clear for some time that the days of cheap credit and surging property prices are over.I believe that stability will eventually return but it may be some time coming, possibly not until 2010 onwards.The situation should turn around as the economic cycle continues and, if you can focus on the long-term, now could represent an excellent opportunity to drip money into the stock market to take advantage of lower prices.If you can invest for the long-term (five to 10 years-plus) drip feeding your cash into the market either monthly or on an ad-hoc basis is a good approach.By purchasing shares when the market is high and when it is low, the 'average price' paid is reduced.However, the most important advice I can give is do not make any hasty decisions and always seek independent advice.
