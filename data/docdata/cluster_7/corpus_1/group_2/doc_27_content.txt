 The UK's retail performance has remained in growth territory despite consumers facing a number of increasing economic pressures including rising food prices, a depressed housing market and tougher credit conditions according to the latest Retail Distribution Review from Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets. The report, compiled by Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets' Economics team, analyses the impact that inflation and employment growth are having on the retail distribution sector and take the pulse of its current financial health.Retail distribution remains a key area of focus as companies review their balance sheets and look to realise more cost efficiencies. We predict that retail activity as a whole will continue to slow in the latter half of the year, reflecting lower household disposable incomes. However, performance will vary across different sectors and consumer borrowing may help to cushion the blow. Food and internet sales should remain solid, although large clothing retailers operating in a more highly competitive environment may see their margins shrink further.Capital spending to modernise and increase store capacity will continue, and the allure of emerging markets will see international operators looking to invest in new growth areas. We are confident about the medium-term prospects for the retail distribution sector, despite the tough market conditions it faces.Richard Price, MD and Head of Lloyds TSB Corporate Market's Retail Sector commented: Food sales have held up so far, although some commentators are attributing this partly to higher food prices. There has also been a shift towards the value end of the market.Limited mortgage availability arising from the on-going credit crunch, and the Monetary Policy Committee's inability to cut interest rates given the two way pull of high inflation and declining UK economic growth is feeding through to those sectors usually driven by house moves. Consequently sales of big-ticket items such as furniture and large electricals remain depressed for many retailers.Whilst there are some signs that the weakening pound is providing support - at least for the London market - with overseas shoppers active in the capital over the summer, there is no doubt conditions will be difficult for the remainder of this year at least.
