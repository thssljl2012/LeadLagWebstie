Alarm bells over crashed tour operator XL Leisure have rung for months, aviation industry insiders said today following the departure of the group's chief executive in May after being made bankrupt.XL, which has claimed to be Britain's third-largest tour operator and operates XL Airways, became the 24th tour operator or airline to go bust in Britain this year after it went into administration last night.The failure is a major blow for Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, the finiancier behind last year's takeover of West Ham football club. He is a major shareholder in Eimskip, the Icelandic shipping group which is an associate company of XL and stands behind a 207million (164.8million) loan guarantee to the firm.Yesterday an Eimskip spokesman said: 'The likelihood that the loan will fall on Eimskip has increased.'XL's collapse follows the failure to refinance borrowings reckoned to run to more than 200 million as it became the latest operator to fall foul of the soaring price of airline fuel.However industry insiders have been sounding the alarm about the group since the departure of Peter Owen its chief executive. He quit in June citing personal reasons.It then emerged that a fortnight before he had become bankrupt.Owen, 61 and a former British Airways and Aer Lingus executive, had also been chairman of the business class airline Silverjet, which failed in May. It has also emerged that Owen owed Silverjet 240,000 when it went bust.The collapse will also see Barclays take a hit understood to be up to 10million. It is understood Barclays was the hedge counter-party to XL's fuel hedging policy.Rather than call in XL's liability and force it into insolvency, it is understood Barclays agreed to convert it into a loan.The failure of XL was seen as good news for its larger rivals.Tui, the Thomson travel group saw its shares rise 9p to 230 p while Thomas Cook was up 7p at 242p.Reader views (0)No comments have so far been submitted.Add your commentName:Your email address will not be publishedEmail:Town and country:Your comment:Terms and conditions make text area bigger You have  characters left.Remember me - this will save your name, location and email address for when you leave your next comment.Email me a link to these comments.
