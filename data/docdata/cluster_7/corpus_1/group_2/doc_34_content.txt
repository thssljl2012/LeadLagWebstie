MARK Little, the Scottish boss of Barclays Wealth, has again plundered Adam &amp;amp; Co by poaching Chris Cowan to bolster his Edinburgh team. Cowan joins Duncan Hunter, who has moved from Barclay's headquarters in London to expand the group's investment management division.The news comes on the back of several big hires for the firm, including Douglas Noble, poached from Adam &amp;amp; Co last year. He now heads the Edinburgh office, overseeing the firm's private banking and investment management divisions. He was joined by James Osborne and Cherie Hamoudi, who joined the investment management team in August from Turcan Connell.Little, who joined from Deutsche Bank in 2006, has moved to reorganise his team after the defection in the spring of 27 staff fund managers to Williams de Broe amid speculation that they were not happy with Barclays' holistic approach to fund management.Little said: 'At the end of the day this business is about talent and we needed to upscale our intellectual capacity. The events with Williams de Broe have allowed me to do that. 'It is a real coup for us to secure someone of Duncan's experience to our Edinburgh operations and I am confident that both Duncan and Chris will help further develop our offerings within Scotland.'It has been suggested that because we are big there is an automatic assumption that we don't offer levels of service to our clients. I find that insulting because the whole ethos of what we are about is to give world class service to our clients. 'That is why I fought very strongly to have offices in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Belfast. The reason I did that is because I wanted to serve our clients 24/7 real time.'
