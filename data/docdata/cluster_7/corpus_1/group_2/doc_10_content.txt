A week ago there were five big banks in the UK. Today, after a remarkable week in the global economy, there are effectively four, following the rescue of HBOS by Lloyds TSB.A lot has been written about the job implications of the merger as well as the unprecedented pressure on HBOS's stocks.But what about consumers? Will borrowers and savers see any benefits or will they be clobbered?Between them, Lloyds TSB and HBOS have a number of brands, and it is likely there will be some consolidation in the market.'We need to wait and see how many of these survive the merger,' said Louise Cuming, head of mortgages at Moneysupermarket.com'Obviously, if some of these disappear, customer choice and competition will be eroded, which can only be to the detriment of borrowers.'Lloyds has always run a very conservative ship and I have no doubt the merged operation will have a diminished appetite for higher-risk specialist lending. 'This could leave borrowers without squeaky clean credit ratings or large deposits without a hope of being accepted by the new super bank.'Therefore, the slightly riskier part of the housing market populated by first-time buyers and sub-prime borrowers is set to stagnate even further, which won't be good for the market as a whole.'Lloyds TSB and HBOS control six major mortgage brands - Lloyds, Cheltenham &amp;amp; Gloucester, Halifax, Bank of Scotland, BM Solutions and Intelligent Finance.'The consolidated company will have nearly 30pc of the UK mortgage market,' said Michelle Slade, an analyst at Norwich-based data provider Moneyfacts.co.uk'Halifax and Cheltenham &amp;amp; Gloucester are both major and well known brands in the UK and it is unlikely that these brands will disappear. 'By keeping at least the majority of the current brands, the new group will likely maintain a hold over their mortgage market share.'And she added: 'As more and more companies enter into mergers, we inevitably start to worry about a lack of consumer choice. 'If one provider has a major hold in any aspect of a market, it results in consumers being worse off.'Andrew Hagger, another analyst, said it would be interesting to see which direction the enlarged organisation would take.'Whilst the new combined mega-bank will reportedly have retail savings balances in excess of 200bn, potentially making it a force to be reckoned with, it will be interesting to see the customer acquisition strategy it adopts,' said Mr Hagger, of Moneynet.co.uk'HBOS has, for many years, had a reputation for offering extremely competitive products, making it a regular player in best-buy tables, particularly in the savings, current account and credit card arenas.'On the other hand, Lloyds TSB products have been less competitively priced than HBOS, although both brands have in the past made extensive use of TV advertising to plug their wares.'So will the keenly priced HBOS products be pulled from the shelves or perhaps be toned down? Or will the enlarged Lloyds TSB take a more aggressive stance?'The events of the last few days will undoubtedly involve all UK lenders taking an even more cautious approach to personal lending, and with an increased unwillingness between banks to lend to each other, will we see a further spike in savings rates in an effort to tempt more retail deposits through the front doors of their high-street outlets?'
