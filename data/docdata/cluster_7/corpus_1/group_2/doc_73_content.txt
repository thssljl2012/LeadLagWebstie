(Reuters) - Lloyds TSB (LLOY.L: Quote, Profile, Research) sold shares worth 767 million pounds on Friday to take advantage of a surge in bank stocks to boost its capital a day after its 12 billion-pound takeover of rival HBOS (HBOS.L: Quote, Profile, Research).Lloyds announced the placing on Friday afternoon and later said it had sold 284.4 million shares at 270 pence each. This amounted to around 5 percent of Lloyds's current issued share capital.The sale price was at a 5.5 percent discount to Lloyds' closing share price of 285.75p, up 20 percent on the day.Lloyds agreed an all-share deal to rescue HBOS on Thursday, after its rival's shares were battered in the past week by fears about its funding position.The takeover will weaken Lloyds' capital position, but Lloyds said the placing would allow it to strengthen its capital and 'support the development of our business strategies.'

Its shareholders will own 56 percent of the enlarged group.The shares were sold via an accelerated bookbuild on Friday afternoon managed by Citigroup (C.N: Quote, Profile, Research) and Merrill Lynch (MER.N: Quote, Profile, Research).(Reporting by Steve Slater; Editing by Greg Mahlich)
