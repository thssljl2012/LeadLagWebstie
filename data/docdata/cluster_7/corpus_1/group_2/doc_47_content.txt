Australian financial stocks plunged after Lehman Brothers failed to find a saviour over the weekend, raising the prospects of a fresh round of global write-offs and reigniting fears that there is no end in sight for the credit crisis.Shares of NAB were hammered, losing as much as 4.9%, or $1.17, to $22.79, taking it back to May 2000 lows, bringing its year-to-date losses near 40%.Macquarie Group, whose business has spread into areas similar to Lehman's, has dropped as much as 9.2%, or $4.06, to $39.95, to levels not seen since November 2004. Shares in Macquarie have lost nearly half their value since the beginning of the year.Macquarie is ''not as vanilla as a major bank in Australia. It's probably a bit more inventive,'' said Lisa Jarvis, financial adviser at ABN Amro Morgans.Regarding Macquarie, Ms Jarvis said, ''we're factoring in a worse case scenario. That is for Lehman to fail. It sets a precedent for the weakest stocks flailing in the US market.''Ms Jarvis said the market is struggling to understand how much of counterparty risk would be unleashed on to financial services companies that have done business with Lehman. Investors would also be looking for the next major investment bank to collapse, she said, with concerns about the viability of insurer American International Group rising.Panic sellingNo banks were immune to the panicked selling.ANZBank gave up as much as 3.6%, or 62 cents, to trade at $16.63.ANZ, along with NAB, have announced billions of dollars in write-downs tied to the fall in asset values this year.The Commonwealth Bank of Australia shed as much as 3.4%, or $1.47, to $41.52 while Westpac has lost as much as 2.4%, or 57 cents, to $22.95.The uncertainty in banking rose from every quarter.The Wall Street Journal reported Bank of America would buy US investment bank Merrill Lynch for $44 billion, after its stock lost more than one-third of its value last week on credit crunch fears.Adding to the jitters among local financial service stocks, former Babcock &amp;amp; Brown chief Phil Green has quit the infrastructure investment business' board.The announcement sent the company's shares tumbling as much as 26.5 cents, or 14%, to $1.635 in early trade.Financial stocks have lead losses today, with the sector declining 2.7% while the overall market is trading 1.4% lower, or 69.3 points to 4834.5.
