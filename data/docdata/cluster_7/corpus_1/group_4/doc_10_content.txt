THE Federal Government won't rule out the Budget going into deficit if that's what it takes to stimulate a slowing Australian economy.  Assistant Treasurer Chris Bowen said that the community wants the Government to respond flexibly to the current global financial crisis.   The Government will this month release its mid-year economic and fiscal outlook, which is almost guaranteed to show slowing growth and rising unemployment. 'I think the Australian people would expect the Australian Government to do whatever is necessary to ensure robust growth,' Mr Bowen said. 'We've indicated our position, which is that we're fiscal conservatives and we will have a Budget surplus across the cycle. 'But the Australian people would want us to deal with the emerging situation flexibly and decisively.' But Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull warned the Government against making any rushed decisions. 'The Rudd Government has to take very great care that it doesn't fritter that away in poorly designed and poorly executed economic policy decisions,' he said. The economic turmoil is likely to mean some good news for consumers - economists are predicting the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will cut official rates by half a percentage point when its board meets tomorrow.   Mr Bowen called on banks to pass on to consumers as much as possible of this week's expected interest rate cut. 'We continue to talk to the banks and say that they should pass on as much as they can at all times,' he said. Mr Turnbull continued his campaign for the banks to pass on the full extent of any rate cut. 'They are in a position to do so in my view,' he said.
