SYDNEY, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Australian property trust GPT (News)   Group plans to buy back up to A$700 million ($454.2   million) of notes due in March 2009 to reduce its debt, it said   on Wednesday.   GPT will use the proceeds of a A$1.6 billion share placement   completed last month. The equity raising consisted of an   institutional sale of A$1 billion and a retail component of A$550   million expected to close on Friday.   GPT did not give details on the bond buyback timeframe and   pricing levels, saying the debt reduction would depend on   investor feedback.   The buyback involves A$325 million 6.00 percent fixed rate   notes and A$375 million in floating rate notes both maturing on   March 30, 2009.   Westpac Institutional Bank and UBS are jointly managing the   buyback.   Australia's property sector has been among the biggest   casualties of the global credit crunch, and GPT has been hit   especially hard. It has borrowed in foreign currencies and was   exposed to the recent dramatic slide in the Australian dollar   when it lost 24 percent in just two months.   GPT is rated BBB by Standard&amp;amp;Poor's and Aa2 by Moody's.
