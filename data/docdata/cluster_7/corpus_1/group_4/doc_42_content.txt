The wage price index for the September quarter grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent, keeping the annual rate at 4.1 per cent.   This is comfortably within the the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) perceived line in the sand at 4.5 per cent.   Economists had forecast a one per cent increase for the September quarter after a 1.1 per cent increase in the June quarter.   Still, the central bank's focus now is on keeping economic growth afloat in the face of a sharply-slowing world economy and expects inflation will be tamed as the economy slows.   Economists expect the RBA to cut the official cash rate by at least a further 50 basis points next month, on top of the 200 basis point worth of easing seen since September.
