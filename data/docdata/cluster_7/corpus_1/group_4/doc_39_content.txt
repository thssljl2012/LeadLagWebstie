Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd chief executive officer Ralph Norris says loan losses and provisions will increase significantly in the first half of fiscal 2009 because of company failures and the economic slowdown. 'We remain cautious about the outlook for at least the next 18 months,' Mr Norris will tell the bank's annual general meeting in Melbourne on Thursday. 'Loan losses will increase and the Group's exposure to Lehman Brothers, Allco Finance Group Limited and ABC Learning Centres Limited will result in significantly higher first half provisions,' Mr Norris says in a copy of his speech released to the market on Thursday morning.
