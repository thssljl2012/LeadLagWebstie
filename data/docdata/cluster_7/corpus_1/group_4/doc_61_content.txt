The Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday responded to continued signs of a slowing economy with an interest rate cut of 75 basis points.  RBA Governor Glenn Stevens announced in Sydney that the bank's official cash rate target would move to 5.25 percent, from the 6.0 percent level established in October.  Most analysts had anticipated a rate cut of 50 basis points, and it marked the third straight monthly meeting at which the RBA reduced rates, with the OCR target having been slashed 100-basis points in October in reaction to the global financial crisis. The RBA also cut rates 25 basis points in September.  Tuesday's move takes the rate to its lowest level since December 2003.   by RTT Staff Writer  For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com
