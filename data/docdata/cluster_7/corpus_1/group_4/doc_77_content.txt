(RTTNews) - A gauge of activity in Australia's services sector tops Wednesday's economic data calendar for the Australia-New Zealand region.  A weak result is expected when the Australian Industry Group releases its Performance of Service Index for October. the report follows a long list of weak economic reports in recent days, leading to Tuesday's larger-than-expected 75-basis point interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia.  Last month, the PSI turned in a reading of 44.9, with readings below 50.0 indicating contraction of activity in the surveyed sector. The AiG's PSI report is set for release at 22:30 GMT.  Two hours later, the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases its monthly report on the nation's trade balance and a look at building construction approvals for September.  In the previous period, the trade balance registered A$1.364 billion. Most economists are expecting the balance to shrink to A$500 million for September.  In August, building construction approvals fell 3.7 percent from the month before and was 8.6 percent lower than one year earlier. Analysts, on average, are forecasting the month-on-month total to drop by 1.0 percent and the full year figure to decline 14.3 percent.  New Zealand's calendar of economic data releases is clear for Wednesday.
