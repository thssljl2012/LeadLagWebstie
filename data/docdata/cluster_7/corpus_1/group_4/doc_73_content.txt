Westpac announced yesterday it would cut its interest rate by 0.65 percentage points, denying home borrowers about $30 in savings if it passed on the Reserve's full cut. 'Westpac is sensitive to the challenges being faced by many working families,' Westpac's head of retail and business banking, Peter Hanlon, said. 'However, we are still having to meet substantially higher funding costs.' The NAB chief executive in Australia, Ahmed Fahour, announced the bank would pass on just 0.62 percentage points, citing higher funding costs. 'Despite the RBA cash rate reduction, it is now apparent that the cost of borrowing money anywhere in the world has become a lot more expensive,' he said. ANZ was yet to announce its decision.  Some smaller banks are viewing the decisions by the major banks as an opportunity to tempt new customers.  AMP Banking announced it would cut its standard variable rate by the full 0.75 percentage points, effective from a week and a half.  But other smaller, non-bank lenders continue to struggle to raise funds in a credit constrained world.  GE Money has not passed on the last 1.75 percentage points in interest rate cuts to wholesale customers, which include mortgage brokers and managers.  A company spokesman said GE Money, which raises funds with the backing of its AAA-rated parent company General Electric, was still considering whether it would pass on Tuesday's cut.  He said it had not lowered its rates because GE Money relies on wholesale debt markets and did not have a deposit base.
