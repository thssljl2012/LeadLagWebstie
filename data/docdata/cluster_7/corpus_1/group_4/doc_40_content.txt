The decisive move by the Bank of England earlier this month to cut the base rate by 1.5% means that the recession may be a lot shorter than a painful 18-month downturn.  Already the mortgage market is showing signs of greater competitiveness. After Barclays refused government support to bolster its balance sheet and turned instead to the Middle East, last week Woolwich launched a fixed rate and tracker hybrid product. It is priced at 3.99% for the first year and will then move to 1.99% above Barclays' base rate, currently 3%.  Since its maximum LTV is 60% the hybrid is not suitable for most first-time buyers, but at least it indicates that lenders want to lend again in the remortgage market and through brokers too.  Its low rate means clients remortgaging to this deal will have cash in hand now with the certainty of low payments until 2010. And with interest rates seemingly heading south it will offer clients flexibility, ensuring they benefit from future rate cuts as long as Barclays keeps its own base rate in check.  And fund manager Elliot Associates has snapped up the remnants of edeus to help its management team launch new venture Exact. The key point here is that the hedge fund made a fortune by foreseeing the sub-prime crisis and has a track record of calling things correctly. If it can see light at the end of the tunnel, perhaps we should too.  Of course, these might not be the green shoots of recovery the market wants but at least they are seeds of hope that will develop over time. Mortgage Strategy hopes this trend continues.
