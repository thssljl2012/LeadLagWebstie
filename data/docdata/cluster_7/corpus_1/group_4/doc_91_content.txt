TREASURY head Ken Henry will address the National Press Club today as the Government and Opposition row over economic figures prepared by his department.  Opposition frontbencher Andrew Robb yesterday accused Treasury of manipulating forecasts in the Mid Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, released last week, to spare the Government embarrassment.  Treasury has forecast growth at two per cent while the Reserve Bank of Australia has predicted it will go to 1.5 per cent. 'It has got a smell of manipulation about it,' he told parliament.   This morning, however, Mr Robb said Treasury was not the target of his attack. 'My comment was not directed in any sense at the Treasury,' Mr Robb told ABC radio. 'The Mid Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook is a Government document, not a Treasury document, and my comments have been deliberately misconstrued as an attack on Treasury by the Government as an attempt to silence anybody who asks legitimate questions of the Government.' Assistant Treasurer Chris Bowen said the Government had not pressured Treasury. 'Absolutely not, and it's offensive for Andrew Robb to say that,' Mr Bowen told ABC radio. 'For a very senior figure in the Opposition to undermine the credibility of Treasury figures and to question the integrity of the head of the Treasury is particularly concerning at any time, and extremely concerning at a time of great uncertainty where confidence is the Australia economy is so important, extremely irresponsible.' Last month, Opposition senators subjected Dr Henry to an intense grilling in a Budget estimates hearing.
