Investors are now having to look harder for the best interest rate possible.  Westpac and Kiwibank lowered their mortgage interest rates yesterday and investment rates are also slipping.  National Bank's E-saver account now offers seven percent interest down from 8.4 percent and ASB's Fast Saver account is offering 6.5 percent, down from 8.4 percent.  Chris Tennent-Brown, an economist with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia says the flipside of cheaper mortgages is that it is getting harder for savers. 'You can still get reasonable rates on longer term investments, so people just need to look a little bit harder. Term deposits have been so rewarding over the last few years.'
