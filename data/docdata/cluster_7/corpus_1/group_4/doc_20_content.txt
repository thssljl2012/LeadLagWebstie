China's State Council has moved to pursue an active expansionary fiscal policy and a looser monetary policy in a bid to bolster the Chinese economy amid signs of a slowdown in economic growth elsewhere in the world.  The Chinese authorities approved a 4 trillion renminbi ($585 billion) stimulus package, which represents about 15% of gross domestic product. The money will be spent over the next two years to finance programmes in 10 major areas including property, utilities, infrastructure and technological innovation.  The package includes funds already earmarked in earlier plans, say market participants, but the State Council has brought forward projects and been more specific about its stimulus plans. The Chinese authorities are expected to spend 400 billion renminbi in the fourth quarter of this year.  The macroeconomic policy changes unveiled represent one of the few major shifts during the 30 years since the beginning of reform and the opening up of the economy in 1978, according to analysts at Barclays Capital.
