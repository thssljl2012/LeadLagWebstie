 Falling interest rates have help make tracker mortgages, which 'track' the Bank of England base rate more attractive to borrowers.  They have doubled their share of the mortgage market in the past year and lenders ensure they are not inundated with applications for the products by only offering uncompetitive deals to borrowers with a deposit of at least 25 per cent.  But home owners may be tempted to consider fixing their monthly payments with the new deal from Barclays instead as it is the most competitive on the market, according to experts.  Barclays, which lends under the Woolwich brand, is offering a one-year fixed rate deal of 3.99 per cent, after which borrowers will switch to a lifetime tracker of 1.99 per cent above the base rate.   The mortgage is available to people with a 40 per cent deposit who pay a 995 arrangement fee, although other options are available for people with only a 30 per cent deposit or those who do not want to pay a set up charge.   Other lenders have offered one-year fixed rate loans in the past, but none do so at the moment, and the rate is currently the most competitive on the market.   But experts warned that borrowers are locked into the deal for three years and will have to pay an early redemption fee of 1 per cent of the amount borrowed if they want to exit it sooner.   Barclays also today relaunched its offset tracker mortgages, under which people can use their savings to reduce the interest they pay on their mortgage.   It is offering rates of 2.09 per cent above base rate for term for people with a 40 per cent deposit, and 2.49 per cent above it for people with a 30 per cent deposit.   The lender has yet to relaunch its other tracker products, which were withdrawn last week. And it has also not yet announced whether it will be reducing its standard variable rate mortgage.
