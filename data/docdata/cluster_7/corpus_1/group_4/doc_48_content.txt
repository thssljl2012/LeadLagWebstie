A short time ago the Reserve Bank of Australia surprised some in the market with a bigger than expected rate cut of 75bps to take the official cash rate to 5.25 per cent.  Most market analysts had expected a rate cut of 50bps.  While the CBA have been quick off the mark to announce a rate cut, it may be forced to explain to Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan why it did not pass on the full rate cut.  'If they can't (pass the rate cut) in full they'd better have a pretty good explanation,' Mr Swan said yesterday.  The Treasurer is currently holding a media conference.  CBA's complete home loan variable rate will fall to 7.74 per cent, from 8.32 per cent, while its economiser base variable rate will fall to 7.23 per cent, from 7.81 per cent.  The rates are effective from November 10.  The bank had previously cut its home loan interest rate by 0.21 basis points on October 30.
