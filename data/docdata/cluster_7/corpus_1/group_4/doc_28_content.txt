A Sydney academic who expects zero interest rates by 2010 correctly tipped Tuesday's 75 basis point rate cut by the central bank.  Almost all economists from major banks and financial institutions surveyed by AAP had forecast a 50 basis point move by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).  The RBA announced at 1430 AEDT Tuesday a 75 basis point rate cut, taking the cash rate to 5.25 per cent.  Interest rates were lifted to that level in December 2003, and stayed there until March 2005 before being raised again.  University of Western Sydney associate professor of economics and finance Steve Keen said he was tipping a 75 basis point rate cut 'to surprise everybody'. Dr Keen expects interest rates to fall to two per cent in 2009, before hitting an unprecedented zero per cent in 2010.  He based his RBA rate cut prediction on weak house price and retail sales data. 'Some of the data that has come out in the last couple of days must have them worried,' said Dr Keen, who is also tipping a 50 basis point rate cut in December.  Fourteen of 15 economists surveyed by AAP last week had forecast a 50 basis point rate cut by the RBA.
