BANKWEST warned the Federal Government the industry was losing competition and the big four banks were tightening their grip on customers three months before it surrendered its independence as Australia's sixth biggest bank to the Commonwealth.  The West Australian group was mounting a big push into the eastern states when it expressed serious concerns that the global credit crisis was driving smaller players out of the market.  Its warning - contained in a detailed submission to the Government's inquiry into banking sector competition in mid-July - proved to be prophetic. Shortly afterwards, its British parent, HBOS, fell victim to the financial chaos.  HBOS's desperate need to shore up its balance sheet and its subsequent rescue by the larger British bank Lloyds TSB led to the decision early last month to sell its Australian retail banking and wealth management divisions for $2.1 billion - less than their book value.  The move ended the British group's 13-year flirtation with branch banking in Australia and BankWest's aggressive push into NSW, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia, which it had launched little more than 15 months ago.  The eastern states expansion plan, which was to include 125 retail branches and 35 business banking centres and had resulted in the creation of 3000 jobs over four years, is expected to be axed by the Commonwealth as soon as it takes formal control of BankWest in January.  However, CommBank intends to keep the BankWest brand and its 128 branches and business centres in WA, which will operate alongside CommBank's 87 outlets there.  BankWest is the country's sixth biggest retail bank, and best known in NSW for its bright orange open-plan 'stores' in big shopping centres.  While announcing the expansion in July last year, BankWest and HBOS said it was directly aimed at challenging the dominance of the big four banks - Commonwealth, Westpac, ANZ and National Australia Bank. They cited research that the big four had a grip on 70 per cent of all bank customers and that by offering better interest rates and more competitive products BankWest would be able to prise business away from them.
