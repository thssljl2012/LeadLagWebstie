The number of jobs advertised fell sharply in October, for the sixth consecutive month, as fears about the global financial crisis cut into hiring expectations.  Jobs advertised online and in newspapers tumbled 5.9% in October to an average of 231,135 per week, bringing it 9.8% lower than a year earlier, according to ANZ Bank, which prepares the monthly survey. That's the biggest monthly drop since February 2001. In trend terms, total job ads dropped 2.6% in October.  The resources states of WA and Queensland led the dive, with monthly decreases of 14.8% and 14.1%, respectively. Demand for commodities has underpinned Australia's growth in recent year, making the economy sensitive to any economic slump in Asia. However, no Australian state was immune to the drop in job ads. Victoria lost 11% and New South Wales gave up 11.9%, according to the release. 'The latest job advertisements data suggest the global financial crisis has had a substantial impact on the Australian economy,' said ANZ Head of Australian Economics Warren Hogan in a release. Mr Hogan predicts hiring intentions will 'continue to soften' until they trigger a slowdown in job growth and an unemployment rate of 6.5% by 2010.  Internet job ads dropped 5.5% in October, the third consecutive decline in a row but the 'real weakness' was found in newspaper ads, which retreated 12.2% in October, or about 35% for the year - the weakest annual growth since 2001. 'The only weaker outcomes for newspaper job advertisements over the past 30 years were in 1991 and 1982 when the economy experienced recession,' Mr Hogan said. 'On this basis we will be monitoring the job ads series closely over the next few months. This will be an important indicator of the extent of the looming downturn in the Australian economy and the likely trajectory for unemployment over the next few years.'
