  Treasury chief Ken Henry says he is confident the Australian economy can avoid slipping into negative growth. Both the Treasury and Reserve Bank of Australia have revised down their growth forecasts due to the impact of the global financial crisis.  The Treasury has tipped annual gross domestic product growth to fall to two per cent, while the central bank has revised down its forecast to 1.5 per cent.  Dr Henry today said he was as confident as he could possibly be that Australia would avoid a quarter of negative growth.  Recessions are typically characterised by two consecutive quarters of economic growth.  We're trying our hardest to make sure that happens, that we do avoid a quarter of negative growth, Dr Henry told reporters after an address at the National Press Club today.  The Reserve Bank of Australia is also working hard on this, the Reserve Bank of Australia has cut the cash rate ... by 200 basis points since the start of September.  Most of the cut in official interest rates had flowed through to people with mortgages, Dr Henry said.  There were other reasons to be confident about the underlying strength of the Australian economy.  Corporate profitability in Australia remained high with national accounts figures showing corporate gross operating surplus had grown by 11 per cent in the June quarter.  Thats the highest rate of growth of corporate gross operating surplus in more than 20 years.  Dr Henry said low unemployment, a large pipeline of investment in the engineering, construction and resources sectors, as well as stimulus action taken by various governments would buoy the economy.  Dramatic action has been taken and is likely to be taken globally, and when added to the actions that have been taken domestically... (it) gives one reason to be confident that Australia can indeed avoid a negative quarter of growth.
