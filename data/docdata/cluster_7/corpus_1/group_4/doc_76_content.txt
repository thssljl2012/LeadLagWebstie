  The Federal Government wont rule out the budget going into deficit if thats what it takes to stimulate a slowing Australian economy. As the Australian share market prepared for a boost at the open this morning, Assistant Treasurer Chris Bowen said he believed that the community wanted the government to respond flexibly to the current global financial crisis.  The government will this month release its mid-year economic and fiscal outlook, which is almost guaranteed to show slowing growth and rising unemployment.  I think the Australian people would expect the Australian government to do whatever is necessary to ensure robust growth, Mr Bowen said.  Weve indicated our position, which is that were fiscal conservatives and we will have a budget surplus across the cycle.  But the Australian people would want us to deal with the emerging situation flexibly and decisively.  But Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull warned the government against making any rushed decisions.  The Rudd government has to take very great care that it doesnt fritter that away in poorly designed and poorly executed economic policy decisions, he told reporters.  The economic turmoil is likely to mean some good news for consumers - economists are predicting the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will cut official rates by half a percentage point when its board meets tomorrow.  Mr Bowen called on banks to pass on to consumers as much as possible of this weeks expected interest rate cut.  We continue to talk to the banks and say that they should pass on as much as they can at all times, he said.  Mr Turnbull continued his campaign for the banks to pass on the full extent of any rate cut.  They are in a position to do so in my view, he said.  The Australian sharemarket is expected to open higher today after Wall Street rallied on Friday.  Earlier today, the December Share Price Index futures contract on the Sydney Futures Exchange was up 50 points at 4086.
