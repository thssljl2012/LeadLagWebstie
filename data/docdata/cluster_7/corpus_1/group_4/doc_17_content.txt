 Market watch top headlines Australian reports Aust markets:  :  :  World reports World commodities:  World markets:   WPL, SGB, WBC, CBA, LLC, FXJ, NHC, KCN, TEN, TAH, SHL, FPA, ABS,   AAP 2008-11-13   Radio broadcaster Austereo Group Ltd says the market is more demanding and its first half results will be slightly lower than the previous comparable period.  But the operator of the Triple M network and stations, including 2DAY FM in Sydney and Fox FM in Melbourne, says it is confident of the strength of radio in challenging times.  In August, Austereo forecast earnings to continue growing this financial year after buoyant ratings and advertising revenue helped drive a 5.1 per cent lift in profit for 2007/08.  At the time, it reported net profit of $48.8 million, saying it expected a rise of up to three per cent in radio advertising sales in capital city markets in the first half of fiscal 2009.  On Thursday, chairman Peter Harvie revised those industry estimates downwards. 'Based on the market year-to-date figures, it is our belief that the July-December '08 half capital city revenue will be around minus 3.5 per cent,' Mr Harvie said. 'We also believe that Austereo's first half financial results will be slightly below the previous comparative period. 'We are confident of the strength of radio in challenging times.' Mr Harvie said that in 20 years to 2007, four years were in negative industry growth for all media.  Against that trend, radio outperformed the combined growth of the major media categories of metropolitan radio, television and press in each of those years, he said.
