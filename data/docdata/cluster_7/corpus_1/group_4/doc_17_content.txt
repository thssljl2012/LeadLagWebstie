CONSUMER group Choice has placed its own 'help wanted' ads looking for an alternative buyer for BankWest in an attempt to promote competition in the sector.  Commonwealth Bank has agreed to buy BankWest for $2.1 billion from beleaguered British banking and insurance group HBOS.  But, using an image of a weeping sun and a recorded message with an American accent, Choice argues another purchaser could 'give BankWest its smile back' - for $2.6 billion. Choice spokesman Christopher Zinn said there was 'far too much concentration' in the retail banking market.'BankWest's plans for more than 100 new BankWest branches across the eastern seaboard have already been scrapped by the (Commonwealth Bank),' he said.Recently Westpac won government approval for its merger with St George, although shareholders must still approve the deal.  And the purchase of BankWest will remove another player from the market, further strengthening the Big Four - Commonwealth Bank, Westpac, ANZ and National Australia Bank.  However, a Commonwealth Bank spokesman said competition was 'alive and well' in Australia, as evidenced by the competitive home loan rates available.  Last month there was speculation the Australian Government might relax its four pillars policy in view of the global credit crisis that has weakened banks worldwide.  But, announcing a deposit guarantee scheme, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said the Government was committed to the four pillars policy, which was instituted to ensure competition in the market.  KPMG banking partners Andrew Dickinson and Michelle Hinchliffe said there were now few players beyond the Big Four. And the Government would be 'extremely reluctant' to allow those four to merge.
