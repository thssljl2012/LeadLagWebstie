Online bookmaker Centrebet International Ltd says Australians can expect either a 50 basis point or 75 basis point official interest rate cut next month.  Centrebet says it is the first bookmaker in Australasia to field bets on the official Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announcements on interest rates.  It also has future plans to accept bets on world oil prices and currency moves.  Centrebet's media chief Neil Evans said on Thursday that punters were expecting a significant cut to the cash rate, which stands at 5.25 per cent. 'The 0.26 per cent up to and including 0.50 per cent reduction has opened a $2.25 favourite on Centrebet, just ahead of the 0.51 per cent to 0.75 per cent cut, quoted at $2.40,' Mr Evans said in a statement. 'We expect punters to back both, although our feeling is the initial financial target now of a 0.75 per cent cut will slowly filter back to a 0.50 per cent announcement. 'Yet, some punters might consider the full 1.0 per cent reduction very good value at $7.00, considering the continued economic downturn and the brutal counter-effect the NSW slash-and-burn mini-budget is seemingly having on professional confidence.' 'Punters can get $11.00 for official rates to stay the same.' The online wagering and gaming company said forecasts suggested the official cash rate was headed for a generational low.  In August, the company posted a 17 per cent growth in net profit for fiscal 2008 and forecast double digit net profit growth of between 10 per cent and 15 per cent in financial year 2009.
