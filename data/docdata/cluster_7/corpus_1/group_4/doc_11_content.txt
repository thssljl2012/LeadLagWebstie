Expectations for inflation have fallen sharply as consumers become increasingly glum about the outlook for the local and global economy, a survey has found.  The Melbourne Institute survey of consumer inflationary expectations found the expected median inflation rate was at 3.3 per cent in November, compared with 4.4 per cent the previous month.  The proportion of respondents expecting prices to rise in the next 12 months decreased by 13.1 percentage points to 61.7 per cent in November - the lowest reading since March 2001.  The proportion expecting prices to fall was 2.1 percentage points higher in November at 6.0 per cent.  Melbourne Institute research fellow Sam Tsiaplias said consumers wound back their outlook on inflation due to the prospect of slower growth and higher unemployment. 'This month's significant decline in consumer inflationary expectations reflects increasing pessimism regarding domestic and global economic conditions,' Dr Tsiaplias said in a statement.  The number of respondents who expected inflation to fall back within the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) target band of two to three per cent over the economic cycle rose to 9.5 per cent in November, from 8.4 per cent the previous month.  The survey of 1,200 people aged 18 years and over was conducted between the 3rd and 9th of November.  The RBA cut interest rates by 75 basis points at its monthly board meeting on November 4.  Separated by professions, clerks and salespersons had the highest expectation for median inflation at 5.0 per cent, with the 'retired, unemployed and home duties' category recording the lowest at 3.2 per cent.
