 The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has left the door open to further falls in official interest rates, after revising down its estimates for economic growth and warning of the need to avoid a sharp slowdown in the months ahead.  The central bank on Monday said growth in domestic demand had moderated significantly in recent months and that given the weakness in the global economy it expected the local economy would 'remain below trend for some time.' The RBA also said it appeared likely its preferred measure of underlying inflation was nearing its peak in quarterly terms and would 'begin to decline' in the next few quarters.  Its main task in coming months would be to find a balance between softer domestic economic conditions and the need for inflation to fall back to within its two to three per cent target band. 'In reviewing that stance of policy each month in the period ahead, the board will be seeking to strike the appropriate balance between avoiding an unduly sharp weakening in demand and the need for inflation to fall back to the target over a reasonable period,' the RBA said in its quarterly statement on monetary policy.' The RBA made 'modest' downward revisions to its estimate for gross domestic product (GDP) growth out to December 2010.  It now expects annualised GDP growth of 1.5 per cent to December 2008, 1.5 per cent to June 2009 and 1.75 per cent to December 2009.  The new estimates compare to its previous forecast for two per cent, 2.25 per cent and 2.50 per cent, respectively.  But while the RBA also still consumer price inflation (CPI) and underlying inflation falling in 2009, the timetable for the expected decline to its target band has been pushed out to December 2010, from June 2010, when both measures are expected to reach three per cent.  Annualised underlying inflation is now seen at 4.5 per cent to December 2008, four per cent to June 2009 and 3.5 per cent to December 2009.  That compares to an earlier forecast for 4.5 per cent, 3.75 per cent and 3.25 per cent, respectively. 'These central forecasts reflect a judgment as to the net effect of a number of powerful influences, some contractionary and some stimulatory, on the Australian economy,' the RBA said. The RBA said the deterioration in the global economy could continue if stresses in financial markets were ongoing.  It also said the global economy could bounce back given the stimulatory measures taken by governments around the world to support their economies, including the federal government's initiative to inject $10.4 billion into the Australian economy. 'On the other hand, the global economy could rebound faster than currently anticipated,' it said. 'If so, the slowing in the domestic economy, especially in the resources sector, could be smaller than forecast here, and the decline in inflation would be more modest.' The central bank has already embarked upon an aggressive policy easing, with three rate cuts totalling 200 basis points since September, to leave the cash rate standing at 5.25 per cent.  Debt futures markets are currently pricing in a further 50 basis point cut in December, and more in the first half of 2009 to counter expected weak economic growth and rising unemployment.  The markets believe the cash rate could be lowered to 3.50 per cent by the end of June next year.  The RBA also noted that domestic demand growth had moderated significantly, led by the household sector, which had cut back on borrowing and seen is wealth fall due to declines in house and equity prices.  Business conditions had also softened and investment intentions appeared to be being scaled back.  Labour market conditions had softened and wage pressures were likely to abate.
