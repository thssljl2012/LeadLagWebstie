Business conditions have dropped to their lowest level in at least 14 years in the face of the global financial crisis and a slowing domestic economy, a new survey shows.  The Commonwealth Bank-Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) business expectations index found business conditions fell to an index of 41.1 in three months to September.  This is the lowest level since the survey began in 1994.  A level below 50 indicates business conditions are contracting. 'Australian businesses are negotiating some extremely heavy weather at the moment,' ACCI's director of industry policy and economics Greg Evans told reporters in Canberra.  Businesses expect the index will fall further to 40.6 in the December quarter.  All components of the index - sales, profits, investment and employment growth - fell during the September quarter. 'We are particularly concerned if that carries through to investment intentions - investment drives jobs and growth,' Mr Evans said. He expects employment growth will moderate further. 'Given the slowdown in the world economy and our domestic economy, an unavoidable consequence of that is going to be rising unemployment.' In the May budget the government forecast unemployment rising to 4.75 per cent by June next year, but this was expected to rise in this month's budget review.  The Reserve Bank expects the jobless rate could increase to five per cent next year compared to its present level of 4.3 per cent. 'We are concerned that could indeed happen and in fact could go higher, especially if there is a drop off in investment intentions on behalf of business,' Mr Evans said. 'Continuing business investment is so important in protecting the jobs of Australians.'  2008 AAP Brought to you by
