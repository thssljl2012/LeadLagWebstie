HONG KONG  The Australian central bank slashed its key interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to 5.25 percent rather than by the half-percentage point that had been widely expected on Tuesday, joining a global wave of rate cuts to fight the financial crisis.  The S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index in Sydney cut earlier losses to end Tuesday at 4,215, down 0.15 percent. It had been down 1 percent before the banks announcement.  In Japan, the Nikkei 225 closed up 6.3 percent after a holiday Monday. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was flat, up 0.22 percent at 14,375 as investors waited for the outcome of the U.S. elections.  International economic data have continued to point to significant weakness in the major industrial economies, and there have been further signs that China and other parts of the developing world are slowing as well, the Reserve Bank of Australia said in a statement accompanying its decision on Tuesday.  Deteriorating international conditions and falling commodity prices will have a dampening influence on the Australian economy.  The Australian cut was the third in just over two months. Last month, the central bank reduced the cost of borrowing by a surprisingly large full percentage point. The bank is taking advantage of the fact that, unlike the United States and Japan, it has plenty of room for maneuver to lower rates still further.  The U.S. Federal Reserve Board last week lowered its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point to 1 percent, its second big rate cut this month.  The European Central Bank and the Bank of England cut rates last week and are all but certain to deliver yet another cut on Thursday.  Unlike Japan, South Korea and others in the Asia-Pacific region, Australia has little exposure to reduced demand for consumer goods and cars. Cutbacks in consumer spending in markets like the United States and Europe has badly hurt economies that rely on these exports.  But the financial crisis has not left the country unscathed. Statistics released this week showed a sharp drop in retail sales and house prices and likely helped persuade the central bank to lower the cost of borrowing.  The f grim data from the United States also add to the fears of global recession. A measure of overall manufacturing activity in the United States fell last month to its lowest level in 26 years, according to data released Monday.  Also on Monday, U.S. automakers announced that sales of new cars and trucks in the United States plummeted in October to the lowest levels in 25 years.  In Japan, Nissan cut its profit forecast and scrapped its dividend plans, prompting its share price to fall 11 percent on Tuesday.
