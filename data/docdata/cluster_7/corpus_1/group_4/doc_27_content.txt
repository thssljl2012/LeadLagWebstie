National Australia Bank Ltd plans to raise about $2 billion by selling shares to institutional investors, as the country's biggest bank by assets aims to strengthen its balance sheet.  The institutional placement, fully underwritten by investment banks Goldman Sachs JBWere, Merrill Lynch and UBS AG, will be used also to allow NAB to grow its business organically, the Melbourne-based bank said in a statement.  NAB said the placement meant the bank would no longer need to underwrite the dividend reinvestment plan for the 2008 final dividend because more favourable market conditions had allowed the bank to speed up capital management plans.  NAB also will offer retail shareholders the opportunity to buy up to $10,000 of shares at the institutional placement price and without brokerage or other transaction costs.  NAB said it reserved the right to limit applications if total demand exceeded $250 million.  NAB's Tier 1 ratio will rise to eight per cent after the capital raising.  2008 AAP Brought to you by
