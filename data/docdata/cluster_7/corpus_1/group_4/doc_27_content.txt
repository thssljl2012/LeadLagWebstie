Predictions that the worst of the financial crisis is over could come back to hurt federal Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner, one of his backbench colleagues says.  Mr Tanner has said the worst of the credit crunch had passed in Europe and the US.  South Australian Labor backbencher Mark Butler on Tuesday refused to speculate on whether the worst of the crisis had passed.  'You see some improvement in the financial markets but I'm pretty wary of predicting how these things go, they have a habit of biting you on the bum,' Mr Butler told reporters.  Deputy Opposition Leader Julie Bishop questioned the government's economic growth predictions after Treasury included assumptions about future interest rate cuts in its latest forecasts.  'You don't factor in interest rate reductions. They said it was unusual,' she told reporters Tuesday.  'What assumptions has the government made on interest rate reductions in order to come up with a growth figure that had a two in front of it?'  Last week's mid-year budget review forecast a growth rate of 2.0 per cent for the current fiscal year, more optimistic than the World Bank's 1.8 per cent estimate and the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA's) estimate of 1.5 per cent.  Ms Bishop's concerns were echoed by frontbench colleague Andrew Robb.  'It's got the smell of manipulation about it,' he told reporters.  'I think they were required to get a two in front of the forecast so the prime minister wasn't embarrassed.'   2008 AAP  Brought to you by  When news happens:send photos, videos &amp;amp; tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us.  9:31AM SA war veteran's medals stolen  9:29AM No ABC Learning staff shortages: Gillard  9:14AM Harvey Norman sales fall 2.8 per cent
