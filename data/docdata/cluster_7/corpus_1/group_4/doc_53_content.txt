/PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX/ -- SBP   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating -- Santander BanCorp (NYSE: SBP; LATIBEX: XSBP) ('the Corporation') reported yesterday its unaudited financial results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2008. The Corporation reported net income of $16.1 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008 and a loss of $8.2 million for the third quarter of 2008. These results incorporate a one-time before tax provision related to a claim receivable of $25.1 million resulting from certain securities sold under agreements to repurchase for which Lehman Brothers Inc. ('LBI') was the counterparty. On September 19, 2008, LBI was placed in a Securities Investor Protection Corporation liquidation proceeding.  The Corporation's financial results reflect the following:  -- An improvement of 64 basis points in net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, to 4.40% for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 versus 3.76% for the same period in 2007 and an improvement of 120 basis points to 4.76% for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 compared to 3.56% for the same quarter in 2007.  -- Non-interest income for to the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, increased $23.3 million or 24.2% and $5.9 million or 19.4%, respectively as compared to the same periods in prior year.  -- Operating expenses for the nine and three-month periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 reflected a decrease of $10.6 million or 4.1% and $12.4 million or 10.9%, respectively as compared to the same periods in prior year.  -- The Efficiency Ratio, on a tax equivalent basis, for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2007 was 59.21% and 65.59%, respectively, reflecting an improvement of 638 basis points. For the quarter ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, the Efficiency ratio, on a tax equivalent basis, was 59.00% and 68.81%, respectively, reflecting an improvement of 981 basis points.  -- The Corporation's total assets experienced a $1.0 billion decrease to $8.2 billion at September 30, 2008. This decrease is partially attributed to a reduction of $502. 3 million in investment securities available for sale during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008, the sale of $194.7 million in impaired loans to an affiliate further described below and the Corporation's ongoing efforts taken to reduce risk weighted assets;  -- The provision for loan losses represented 112% of the net charge-offs for the nine months ended September 30, 2008; and  -- Total non-performing loans (excluding other real estate owned) were reduced by $84.8 million to $209.6 million or 3.26% of total loans as of September 30, 2008 from $294.4 million or 4.16% of total loans as of December 31, 2007. This decrease in non-performing loans is partially attributed to the sale of certain impaired loans to an affiliate for $194.7 million in cash.

This one-time event is expected to be compensated by eliminating the interest cost of an expensive repurchase agreement. This event could represent approximately an average $4 million in additional annual net interest income. Despite the challenging environment, the Corporation registered a significant improvement in its net interest margin, double digit growth in non-interest income during the nine- month period ended September 30, 2008, and a reduction in operating expenses and non-performing loans.'  Net Interest Income  The Corporation's net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 was $268.1 million, an increase of $34.4 million, or 14.7%, compared with $233.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007. This improvement was mainly due to a decrease in interest expense of $79.4 million or 29.2% when compared with the same period in prior year. The average cost of funds on interest-bearing liabilities experienced a decrease of 129 basis points from 4.78% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2007 to 3.49% for the same period in 2008. This was influenced by the reduction in federal funds rates made by the Federal Reserve since June 2007 which resulted in a lower cost of short term borrowings. Interest income reflected a reduction of $45.0 million or 8.9% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 mainly due to decreases of $31.8 million or 7.1% principally caused by changes in rate and to a lesser extent to a decline in volume in interest income on loans and $12.1 million or 23.8% in interest income on investment securities attributed a decline in volume and also a decrease from a rates.  The Corporation's net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2008 reached $92.4 million compared with $76.0 million for the same period in 2007, reflecting an increase of $16.4 million, or 21.5%. There was a decrease in interest expense of $38.5 million or 40.9% when compared with the same period in prior year due to a decrease in average cost of funds of 164 basis points from 4.81% to 3.17% for the quarter ended September 30, 2008. Interest income reflected a reduction of $22.1 million or 13.0% for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 from $170.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 to $148.0 million mainly due to a decrease of $15.4 million or 10.2% in interest income on loans.  The average interest-earning assets at September 30, 2008 decreased $269.0 million or 3.2% when compared with figures reported at September 30, 2007. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease of $210.0 million in average investment securities due to a reduction of $347 million of investment securities available for sale during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008, which includes $221 million of investment held as collateral of the securities sold under agreements to repurchase with LBI. There was a decrease of $165.8 million in average net loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared with the same period in 2007.  For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008, the decrease in average investment available for sale and average net loans was partially offset by an increase of $106.7 million in average interest bearing deposits.  The decrease in average interest-bearing liabilities of $229.6 million or 3.0% for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008, was driven by a decrease in average borrowings of $524.1 million when compared to the nine- month period ended September 30, 2007.  For the three-month period ended September 30, 2008, net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, reflected an increase of 120 basis points from 3.56% for the quarter ended September 30, 2007 to 4.76% for the quarter ended September 30, 2008. The 120 basis points increase in net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, was mainly due a decrease in interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities of $38.5 million or 40.9% principally due to a decrease in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities of 164 basis points. This reduction in interest expense was principally due to the significant reduction of 197 basis points in the cost of average borrowings (comprised of federal funds purchased and other borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and commercial paper issued) from 5.62% for the third quarter of 2007 to 3.65% for the same quarter of 2008, reflecting the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts.
