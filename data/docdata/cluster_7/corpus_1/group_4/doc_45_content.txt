SYDNEY, Nov 6 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank said on Thursday it had loan exposure of about A$140 million ($94.8 million) to collapsed childcare operator ABC Learning Centres Ltd.   It also said that though it was not a lender to Australia's Allco Finance Group Ltd, which also collapsed this week, it had loaned money to entities within the group.
