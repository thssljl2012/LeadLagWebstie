The Australian dollar was weaker at midday as estimates that Europe is already in recession stirred more fears about a slowing world economy.  But the domestic currency could get a boost today if the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cuts interest rates by only 25 basis points instead of the 50 basis points economists are expecting.  In early afternoon trade, the dollar was at $US0.6682, down nearly 1.5 US cents from yesterday's close of $US0.6825.  The dollar struggled today, after the European Commission said the region's economy was likely to have entered a recession this year.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia currency strategist Joseph Capurso said the dire economic news from Europe had hurt the local currency as traders worried about a slowing global economy.  'That raises questions about the world economy and Australia is a small, open economy, so you get hit from whatever happens overseas,'' he said. 'That's the reason we saw softening.''  The Brussels-based European Commission forecast economic growth in the 15-member euro zone contracting by 0.1% in the third and fourth quarters of 2008.  The European economy shrank 0.2% in the second quarter of this year, the commission estimated.  Mr Capurso said the Australian dollar could surge to $US0.6850 this afternoon if the RBA cut rates by a smaller than expected 25 basis points.  He said the RBA expected the banks to match in full any official rate cut this month, amid a fall in wholesale funding costs in recent weeks.  The RBA slashed rates by 100 basis points in October on the expectation the banks would not pass on in full an official easing in monetary policy.  'Commercial banks have passed that on to their clients: the Reserve Bank was not expecting that,'' Mr Capurso said about how the major banks cut lending rates by 80 basis points in early October and by another 20 basis points at the end of last month.  All 15 economists surveyed by AAP, including the Commonwealth Bank, are expecting a 50 basis point rate cut announcement which would take the cash rate to 5.5%, for the first time since May 2006.  The RBA board met this morning and is due to announce the outcome of its monthly board meeting at 2.30pm.  With Victoria on holiday today, foreign exchange liquidity is thinner than usual.  The bond market was firmer at noon. The yield on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was at 5.363%, down from yesterday's close of 5.405%, while the yield on the June 2011 bond was at 4.518%, down from 4.568%.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December 10-year bond futures contract price was at 94.635, up from yesterday's close of 94.590 while the December three-year contract price was at 95.465, up from 95.415.
