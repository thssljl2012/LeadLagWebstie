The Australian balance of goods and services was a surplus of $1.460 billion, seasonally adjusted, in September, which was almost triple market expectations for a $500 million trade surplus.  It was also the biggest since June 1997, when the trade surplus was $1.540 billion, and the second biggest on record.  The September trade surplus was a 17.7 per cent improvement on August's downwardly revised $1.240 billion surplus, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said on Wednesday.  In September, exports rose by eight per cent, much of it due to a strong rise in non-rural commodity exports, including a 19 per cent jump in metal ores and minerals and a 14 per cent increase in coal exports.  Meanwhile, imports climbed seven per cent, in a month when the Australian dollar was still trading above 80 US cents, but economists expect this sector to slow in tandem with a weakening domestic economy.  ANZ senior economist Katie Dean said a rise in exports in coming months would ensure a run of monthly trade surpluses until mid-2009, when contract prices for key commodities were renegotiated. 'We'll see exports in general weaken over the next six months because of a weakening in the global economy,' she said. 'The big test for the trade balance will be in the first half of 2009 when we expect contract prices for commodities will be negotiated.' Ms Dean said exports surged in value terms in September, despite a weaker Australian dollar, because contract prices for key commodities like iron ore were negotiated in mid-2008 when the Australian dollar was worth about 96 US cents. 'When the Australian dollar fell, the commodities sector was well supported,' she said. The Australian dollar hit a 25-year high of 98.49 US cents in mid July, before falling below 80 US cents in September, and 60.12 US cents in late October, marking a 40 per cent decline in three months.  NabCapital senior economist David de Garis said the weaker Australian dollar helped the export sector.  On the imports side, he said fuel accounted for a third of the increase while consumer goods were static.  Commonwealth Bank senior economist Michael Workman said the trade numbers for September were very good and expected them to be healthy for the next few months. 'It looks like they will stay around a $1 billion over the next four to six months,' he said. 'It looks the import side would be the one that weakens a bit more.' Imports are generally weaker when the local economy slows, as a weaker Australian dollar raises the costs of the imported goods. 'Traditionally, if we have a slowdown underway imports tend to suffer, particularly on the consumption side,' he said.
