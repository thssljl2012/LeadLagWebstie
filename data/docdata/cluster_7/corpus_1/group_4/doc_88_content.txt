32 WST   if 0) Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan has urged banks to pass on an interest rate cut as fast as possible if the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) lowers the cash rate when it meets on Tuesday.  "If there is a decision from the Reserve Bank to cut rates I would urge all banks to pass it on as rapidly as is possible," Mr Swan said.  "We have volatile markets out there at the moment. I would expect all of the banks to pass on any cut should it be announced tomorrow.  "If they can't (pass on the rate cut) in full, they'd better have a pretty good explanation."  The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is tipped to announce an official cut of 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, on Melbourne Cup Day. AAP  Ads from Yahoo!
