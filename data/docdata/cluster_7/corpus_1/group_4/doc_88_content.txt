New Zealand's unemployment rate increased to 4.2 per cent in the September quarter, the highest since the end of 2003, but data released was less gloomy than expected.  Despite the increase in the overall unemployment rate, with the total labour force also growing, the number of people working was also up slightly to the highest level since the Household Labour Force Survey started.  Statistics New Zealand's (SNZ) figures released on Thursday showed the seasonally adjusted number of people employed increasing 0.1 per cent in the quarter to 2.17 million, while people unemployed rose 6.3 per cent, or 6000 people to 94,000.  The labour force participation rate nudged ahead by 0.1 percentage points in the quarter to a record-equalling high of 68.7 per cent.  The median predictions of economists in a Reuters poll was for a participation rate of 68.3 per cent, an unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent and a 0.6 per cent fall in employment for the quarter.  After falling throughout 2007, the unemployment rate has increased in the first three quarters of this year.  With the economy in recession since the start of the year a material deterioration in the labour market was expected to follow, with business confidence surveys pointing to falling employment intentions.  SNZ said the male unemployment rate increased by 0.3 percentage points to 4.2 per cent in the September quarter, while the female unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points to 4.1 per cent.  The number of people employed rose by 3000, with male employment down 5000 or 0.4 per cent, while female employment rose 8000 or 0.8 per cent. That followed a number of large changes in female employment in recent quarters, SNZ said.  Female employment reached 1.02 million, the highest level since the survey started. Female fulltime employment was up 6000 and part-time up 2000, while male full-time employment grew a 'modest' 0.1 per cent but male part-time employment was down 5000.  The rise in the labour force participation rate to 68.7 per cent was a result of a 0.4 percentage point rise in the female labour force participation rate to 62.6 per cent, while the male rate fell 0.4 percentage points to 75 per cent.  Total number of actual hours worked per week decreased 0.9 per cent seasonally adjusted in the September quarter, although the number of usual hours worked was up 0.6 per cent.   2008 NZPA  Brought to you by  When news happens:send photos, videos &amp;amp; tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us.  10:20AM African, Asian join library of genomics  10:20AM Fijians look for quick recovery  10:05AM CBA confirms $170m exposure to Allco
