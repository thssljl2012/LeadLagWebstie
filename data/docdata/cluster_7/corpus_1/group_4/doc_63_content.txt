 Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan has urged banks to pass on an interest rate cut as fast as possible if the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) lowers the cash rate when it meets tomorrow.  If there is a decision from the Reserve Bank to cut rates I would urge all banks to pass it on as rapidly as is possible, Mr Swan told reporters in Brisbane.  We have volatile markets out there at the moment. I would expect all of the banks to pass on any cut should it be announced tomorrow.  If they cant (pass on the rate cut) in full, theyd better have a pretty good explanation.
