Mortgage lenders have been slammed for failing to pass on cuts in the cost of borrowing despite the hefty reduction of one and a half percentage points in the base rate.  Interest rates were slashed to three per cent on Thursday, their lowest level in more than half a century.  However, first-time buyers and remortgaging borrowers hoping for a reprieve in rates have been left disappointed.  Lucky: James Staunton secured a tracker deal with Woolwich last month  Though existing borrowers with tracker loans will benefit, the shock base rate cut on Thursday has meant virtually all trackers have been withdrawn for new borrowers.  Standard variable rates, which mainly apply to borrowers whose special rates have reached the end of their term, have not been cut in many cases. Tracker loans mirror more exactly any rise or fall in the base rate.  Abbey angered borrowers and consumer groups last week by raising rates on its new tracker mortgages by up to half a point only two days before the base rate decision.  Apparently shocked by the scale of the base rate cut, Abbey then withdrew these new rates anyway. Woolwich also increased the cost of its tracker deals last week by up to 0.4 of a point. It followed Nationwide Building Society, which increased some of its trackers by the same amount, and Halifax, which increased its trackers by up to half a point. All three withdrew these offers after Thursday's decision.  Trackers remain popular. Melanie Bien, director at mortgage broker Savills, says remortgaging borrowers who want a variable rate are better off with a tracker because the rate is more transparent than discounted rates and SVRs.  'With a tracker, the borrower knows the pay rate will always mirror movements in the base rate,' she says. 'This isn't always true with a lender's SVR, particularly at the moment when they are under extreme funding pressure and are stretching their profit margins.'  One of the few trackers still available is from HSBC at 0.99 of a point above base rate for the term of the loan and there is a 799 fee.  This looks like an appealing option compared with the best two-year fixed rate of 4.99 per cent with the Woolwich, with a fee of 995.  'If you want a tracker it's too late,' says David Hollingworth at broker London &amp;amp; Country Mortgages. 'Lenders have reviewed their tracker ranges completely and only a handful remain,' he says. 'Hopefully, new deals will re-emerge this week.'  James Staunton, 31, was lucky to secure a tracker deal at 0.99 of a percentage point above base rate with Woolwich, part of Barclays, last month.  After the latest base rate cut, James, a PR for recruitment companies, will pay 3.99 per cent.  'It seems clear that interest rates are set to stay low and could even fall further,' says James, who lives in Vauxhall, south London. 'I was keen to benefit if rates fell and so far that's paid off. With a tracker I know I will always benefit in full from any base rate cuts.'  However, savers - who outnumber borrowers by eight to one - have less cause for cheer. Last week's cut will be reflected in lower savings rates.  Rachel Thrussell, savings expert at moneyfacts.co.uk, says: 'It usually takes at least a month for cuts to filter down into savings rates, but such a large rate cut is bad news for savers, particularly those who rely on their money to generate an income.'
