(RTTNews) - Business confidence in Australia sank to a record low in October, according to a closely watched survey by National Australia Bank.  The bank's business confidence index, a barometer of businesses' feelings about economic conditions declined by 21 points to a reading of minus-29.0 from the September reading of minus-8.4.  It marked the 10th consecutive month of declines, with negative numbers indicating the number of pessimists is greater than the number of optimists. 'Continuing volatility in global equity markets, emergency financial packages, falling commodity prices, and continuing talk of a global recession have finally broken business optimism and now fear reigns supreme,' said NAB group chief economist Alan Oster in a statement. 'Indeed it is worth noting that confidence readings are worse than the bottom of the 1990s recession has more to do with fear of the unknown than actual current outcomes.' The fall in confidence paralleled the drop in current conditions, another part of the NAB survey. Business conditions plunged 10 points to a reading of minus-11 in October from minus-1 in September.
