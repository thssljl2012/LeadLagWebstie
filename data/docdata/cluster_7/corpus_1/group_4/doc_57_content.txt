Deteriorating business conditions saw a subsequent drop in confidence for the September Quarter, the latest Commonwealth Bank  ACCI Business Expectations Survey has revealed.  Expected Economic Performance and General Business Conditions indicators fell to their lowest level since the survey began in 1994, while growth indicators such as Sales Revenue, Profits, Employment and investment also declined during the quarter.   The survey shows businesses are also expecting unemployment to increase over the next three months.   Despite weaker growth, the indexes for Wage Growth and Non-Wage Labour Costs indicate cost pressures remain a problem for business.   However the experts are trying to remain positive as selling prices continue to moderate and export sales still expand, albeit only marginally. 'There is no doubt Australian businesses of all sizes are facing the challenges brought about by tighter operating conditions,' says Commonwealth Bank Corporate Financial Services Executive General Manager Robert De Luca. 'It is important to note that although confidence has been muted, declines in actual activity such as hiring and capex have not been so severe.' According to Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Director of Industry Policy and Economics Greg Evans, this will be buoyed by a moderation of inflation and a further interest rate cut brought about by the recorded weakening in demand.   De Luca says a lower interest rate environment should help to stimulate demand over the coming months and the focus for businesses now should be on 'sound cash flow management'.  * Trader Business Media welcomes feed regarding articles published online.
