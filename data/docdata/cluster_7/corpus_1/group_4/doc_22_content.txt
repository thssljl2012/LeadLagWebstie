Retails sales dropped more than expected in September as consumer spending dried up amid fears of an economic slowdown.  Monthly retail sales fell 1.1%, seasonally adjusted, from a revised 0.6% gain in August, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show, as the lingering effects of decade-high interest rates combined with fears for the economy to put a lid on spending. Analysts had expected a drop of 0.5%.'It's a pretty sharp contraction and doesn't bode well for household spending going forward and contributing to GDP growth in the third quarter,' said Moody's Economy.com Matt Robinson.  In trend terms, retail sales for September gained 0.2%, from 0.3% in August, in line with analysts expectations.   The Reserve Bank, which meets to discuss a rate cut tomorrow, had focused on retail sales six months ago when it raised rates to a decade high. 'You've now got the double-downward pressure of the tight monetary policy of six months ago as well as the global financial market turmoil. And the global economic slowdown is going to doubly weigh on household consumption.'Other signs of weakness are filtering through the economy, as well.  Jobs advertised online and in newspapers tumbled 5.9% in October to an average of 231,135 per week, bringing it 9.8% lower than a year ago at this time, according to ANZ Bank, which prepared the monthly survey.  That's the biggest monthly drop since February of 2001. In trend terms, total job ads dropped 2.6% in October.  czappone@fairfax.com.auBusinessDay
