Victoria may be the next state to sink into a budget deficit after plunging stamp duty revenues erased much of the State Government's surplus in the September quarter.  The Brumby Government's surplus shrank about 80% in the September quarter from a year ago to just $95.8 million.  The state's unfunded superannuation liabilities also blew out to $3.8 billion as the global financial turmoil generated investment losses.  The shrinking surplus comes just two days after the New South Wales Government predicted its budget would sink into a deficit of $917 million this fiscal year because of weakening revenue. It slashed spending and raised tolls in a bid to return to surplus.  'I wouldn't be surprised to see the (Victorian) budget has deteriorated,' said ANZ Bank senior economist Mark Rodrigues. 'We've already seen it with the Commonwealth and NSW.'  'It's a natural consequence of a weaker economic outlook than we expected when the budgets were released in the mid-year.'  The Victorian Government recorded a surplus last fiscal year about $1.5 billion, including $458.1 million in the September quarter last year.  The Government blamed the smaller surplus on slumping stamp duty. It said investment losses for the quarter totalled $753 million.  The Age, with Chris Zappone, BusinessDay
