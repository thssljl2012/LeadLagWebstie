The Australian dollar made modest gains on Wednesday, with all eyes on the US Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee, which is widely expected to provide further stimulus to the struggling economy and financial markets.  At the local close, the dollar was trading at $US0.6677, having dropped to $US0.6617 after the inflation data. It had advanced to as high as $US0.6720 offshore, well above $US0.6636 late here on Tuesday.  The dollar was slightly higher at 59.56 yen, supported by firmer stock markets. The Australian currency tends to gain when markets are less risk averse as investors seek out assets still offering reasonable yield returns.  The Fed is likely to focus on quantitative easing policies at its latest meeting after the target range for federal funds rate was cut to zero last month.  Fresh action from the Fed could give the US dollar a short-term boost, but should also improve investor risk appetite and draw investors back into higher-yielding currencies like the Australian dollar in the longer run, analysts said.  'The Aussie was pretty rangebound with everyone waiting for the Fed,'' said Katie Dean, senior market economist at ANZ.  'Any policy move should provide a bit of a relief rally for the US dollar and support views that the US economy will probably be first out of the downturn.''  Earlier, the Aussie had dipped after domestic data showed fourth-quarter consumer prices fell 0.3%.  The drop in the consumer price index, the biggest since 1997, backed views the Reserve Bank of Australia will opt for at least a 75 basis points rate cut when its monetary policy board meets early next week.  The Aussie rose to a high of $NZ1.2593, its best since August 13, ahead of a widely expected rate cut in New Zealand.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to slash its key cash rate by 100 basis points to 4%, taking it below Australia's benchmark rate for the first time since late 2003.  'If they shock markets by cutting less than 100 basis points, it could prove pretty bad for the New Zealand economy and that should help the Aussie against the kiwi,'' ANZ's Dean added.  New Zealand slipped into a recession early last year, but its cash rate is still amongst the highest in the developed world.  Aussie bond futures were higher, helped by the soft inflation numbers at home and a rally in US Treasuries. Benchmark 10-year US Treasuries rose in Asia, buoyed by hopes the Federal Reserve will move a step closer to buying long-dated government bonds.  There has been speculation the Fed will start buying longer-dated Treasuries. Three-year bond futures rose 0.045 points to 96.965, while the 10-year bond futures added 0.135 points to 95.945.
