VEHICLE sales in December recovered for the first time in six months to post their biggest percentage gain since late 2007 as consumers responded belatedly to aggressive interest rate cuts.  Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed vehicle sales grew by a seasonally adjusted 1.8 per cent in December. This marked the firstly monthly rise since June even as Australia's two largest car financiers GE Money and GMAC withdrew from the market.  The ABS data showed vehicle sales rose to 77,039 for the month, partially reversing the effects of November's 5.2 per cent decline.  CommSec chief economist Craig James said the biggest percentage rise in vehicle sales in 13 months was a delayed reaction to large interest rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) in September, October, November and December.  'We're starting to see the influence of lower interest rates come through,'' he said.  'It's interesting, when interest rates are cut, there's a perception people immediately change their behaviour and buy homes and cars. But for the ordinary individual, for a big purchase like a car there's a degree of thought to that.''  Major lenders GE Money and GMAC withdraw from car financing n December but Mr James said this had not hurt vehicle sales as buyers borrowed instead from traditional lenders such as banks.  The recovery in vehicle sales was driven by a 3.5 per cent increase in demand for four wheel drives, reversing five consecutive months of decline.  Sales of passenger car rose by a mere 0.7 per cent, the first increase since May.  The 'other'' category, which includes trucks and buses, rose by 3.1 per cent, partly undoing a .9 per cent fall in November.  A shade over one million vehicles were sold in Australia in calendar 2008, with the 'other'' segment comprising 22 per cent of sales as the mining and construction industries continued to upgrade their fleets.
