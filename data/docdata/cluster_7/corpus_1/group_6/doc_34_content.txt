Analysts expect the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut interest rates by several per cent in the first six months of 2009, after the International Monetary Fund predicted falling economic growth. The central bank appears likely to cut rates by one per cent to 3.25 per cent at its February 2009 meeting, while markets believe rates could reach 2.5 per cent by April 2009
