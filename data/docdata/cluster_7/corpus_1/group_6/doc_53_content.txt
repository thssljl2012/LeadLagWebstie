Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  THE dollar was slightly weaker at noon as the first contraction in South Korea's economy since 1998 had investors selling the commodities-driven currency.  At 12.00pm (AEDT), the dollar was trading at $US0.6549/53, down from Wednesday's close of $US0.6552/55.  During the morning, the currency moved between $US0.6541 and $US0.6642.  The local currency rose early in the local session as a firmer finish on Wall Street strengthened investor sentiment in favour of risk-sensitive assets, such as the Aussie.  The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 3.51 per cent and the tech-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 4.6 per cent.  However the first contraction in South Korea's economy for a decade, shrinking 5.6 per cent, had a negative effect on the dollar, Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Joseph Capurso said.  'One of the things we suspect that is pushing the Australian dollar down is the very weak GDP data report out of South Korea this morning,'' Mr Capurso said.  'That was much, much weaker than expected.  'The fear in the market is that the South Korean numbers could be looked as a pre-cursor to the Chinese numbers that are coming out (later today).'  China is Australia's second largest export market.  Mr Capurso said the Chinese GDP data would be the key to the dollar's performance during the rest of the Asian session.  'The economists' median annual growth is 6.8 per cent (down from nine per cent),'' he said.  If the GDP data was below forecast, Mr Capurso said the dollar could test $US0.6450, if not lower.
