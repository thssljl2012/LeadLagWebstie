Australian consumer prices fell by the most in a decade last quarter as a huge drop in petrol helped pull annual inflation down sharply, justifying talk of another aggressive cut in interest rates next week.   CNBC.com  Measures of core inflation showed some stickiness with the cost of food, tobacco, housing, rents and clothing all still rising, suggesting deflation was a distant danger in Australia.   Yet such was the dire outlook for global growth that analysts were convinced that inflation would slow further, allowing the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to ease as it desired. 'It tells us that the inflation pulse in the economy is definitely coming off,' said Warren Hogan, head of Australian economics at ANZ. 'If the RBA was tending to want to do another aggressive cut, then this certainly doesn't stand in the way.' The central bank holds its monthly policy meeting on Feb. 3 and investors are counting on a cut of at least 75 basis points in the 4.25 percent cash rate.   Wednesday's report from the government showed its consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, the biggest drop since late 1997 and down from a 1.2 percent increase the previous quarter.   The decline was driven by a steep 18 percent drop in petrol costs, while the cost of cars, drugs and finance also eased. That was balanced somewhat by an 8 percent jump in fruit prices, along with gains in rents, fast food and tobacco.   The CPI was up 3.7 percent on the same quarter a year earlier, a marked slowdown from a 5.0 percent pace in the third quarter and well below the RBA's own forecast of 4.25 percent.   Analysts also suspect consumer prices could be flat or even fall again this quarter, dragging the annual pace back into the central bank's 2 to 3 percent target band.
