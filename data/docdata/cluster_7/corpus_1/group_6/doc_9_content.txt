Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  AUSTRALIA'S headline consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.3 per cent in the December quarter, for an annual rate of 3.7 per cent.  The trimmed mean CPI rose 0.6 per cent in the December quarter, for an annual growth rate of 4.2 per cent.  The weighted median CPI rose 0.9 per cent in the December quarter, with an annual rise of 4.5 per cent.  Market economists had expected the average of the two underlying measures to rise by 0.8 per cent in the December quarter for an annual rate of 4.4 per cent.  The market consensus for the headline CPI was for a fall of 0.4 per cent in the December quarter, for an annual pace of 3.6 per cent.  The ABS calculates the trimmed mean and weighted median measures on behalf of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which uses them to gauge the underlying trend in inflation.  Unlike the headline CPI, the RBA's underlying measures are subject to revision due to the seasonal adjustment of some of their components.
