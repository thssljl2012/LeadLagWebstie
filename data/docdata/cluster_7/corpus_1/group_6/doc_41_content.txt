Australia's inflation rate fell the most in more than a decade in the last three months of 2008, and the government said it was evidence of how fast the world economy is deteriorating.  The 0.3 percent drop in the consumer price index to the end of December compared with the three months to the end of September was slightly less than the 0.4 percent decline expected by many economists.  But it was the biggest quarterly fall since the third quarter of 1997, and reduced the annual inflation rate to 3.7 percent _ down from 5 percent in the 12 months to September, the Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed. 'I think it's now clear that inflation in Australia is subsiding _ as it is of course around the world _ and it's subsiding in response to the global financial crisis which is slowing growth dramatically in the global economy,' Treasurer Wayne Swan told reporters in Canberra.  The consumer price index fall _ spurred by an 18 percent decline in the cost of gasoline _ raises expectations that Australia's central bank will again cut interest rates next week.  The Reserve Bank of Australia has been cutting interest rates aggressively to try to stop the economy falling into recession because of the global financial crisis. In December, the bank cut its key cash rate by one percentage point to a six-and-a-half year low of 4.25 percent.  The government has also ramped up spending to stimulate the economy, with a 10 billion Australian dollar package launched last October. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has indicated more stimulus measures may be announced soon.
