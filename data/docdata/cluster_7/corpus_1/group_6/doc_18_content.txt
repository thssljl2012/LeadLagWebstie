THE dollar opened weaker as a fall in oil prices from a record low in US consumer confidence dragged commodities-driven currencies lower.  At 7am AEDT, the dollar was trading at $US0.6622/26, down from yesterday's close of $US0.6653/56.   During the offshore session overnight, the currency moved between $US0.6570 and $US0.6715.   Oil prices fell as the Conference Board reported US consumer confidence was at an historical low in January.   The board's consumer sentiment index fell to 37.7 points in January, from 38.6 the previous month.   Light sweet crude futures for delivery in March, settled down $4.11 at $41.58 a barrel.   Latitude FX lead sales executive, Jim Devonport, said the dollar had climbed in London trade before the weak consumer confidence report in the US. 'It did not look too comfortable after poor economic data out of the US,' Mr Devonport said from Auckland. 'Risk aversion snapped back in and sold the Aussie.' The confidence report dragged the price of oil down, Mr Devonport said. 'If people are not happy to go out and spend, there is no demand,' he said. 'They are not going to drive their cars.' Gold, Australia's third largest export by value, also was weaker.   The price of gold in Sydney at 7.17am AEDT was $US896.05 per fine ounce, down $US11.55, or 1.27 per cent on yesterday's local close of $907.60.   The Thompson/Reuters CRB index, a measure of global commodities markets, was 2.82 per cent lower.   Mr Devenport said the release of the consumer price index (CPI) for the December quarter later today would not stop the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) from lowering the cash rate to stimulate the economy.   Market forecasts are for headline inflation to fall 0.4 per cent in the quarter, when the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) releases the CPI data at 11.30am AEDT today, and for an annual rate of 3.6 per cent, down from five per cent. 'It may not be too much of a concern for the RBA as it will still cut interest rates,' Mr Devonport said. 'Inflation is basically on the backburner at the moment as you can see with the rest of the central banks around the world.' For the local session, Mr Devonport forecasts the dollar to trade between $US0.6580 to $US0.6700.
