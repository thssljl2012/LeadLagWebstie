TODAY'S fall in the consumer price index (CPI) for the December quarter is further evidence of the impact of the global recession and falling commodity prices on the economy, Treasurer Wayne Swan said.  Consumer prices fell for the first time in two years during the December quarter because of lower prices for petrol, cars, health products and financial services.   The 0.3 per cent fall was the biggest drop since September 1997, data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics said.   Mr Swan said the moderation in underlying inflation compared to recent quarters also suggested that inflation pressures were easing more broadly. 'While the annual inflation rate remains high, this reflects inflationary pressures from earlier in 2008,' he said. 'Inflation is expected to continue to ease over the next six to 12 months, as the full effect of weaker world economic conditions flows through.' The annual inflation rate fell to 3.7 per cent from 5.0 per cent in the 12 months to September, dragging it back towards the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) 2 to 3 per cent target band.   The average of the RBA's weighted median and trimmed mean underlying measures rose 0.75 per cent in the December quarter compared to 1.25 per cent growth in the previous quarter.   But this cut the average underlying annual rate to 4.35 per cent from 4.7 per cent in the 12 months to September.
