Asia's major economies reported a slew of gloomy news on Thursday showing the global crisis was hitting harder, as export-dependent nations feel the pinch from the worldwide slowdown.  China's economy slowed sharply in the final quarter of 2008 to just 6.8 per cent as thousands of factories that sold to overseas markets shut, pulling the full-year growth figure down to 9.0 per cent, official data showed.  South Korea said its economy was in the worst shape since the East Asian financial crisis a decade ago, following a 5.6-per cent contraction quarter-on-quarter in the final three months of last year.  Japan meanwhile announced a 35 per cent plunge in exports in December as consumers worldwide tightened their belts even more, driving Asia's biggest economy further into recession.  'Exports tumbled so much that you cannot believe your eyes,' said Naoki Murakami, chief economist at Monex Securities in Japan.  The three nations have the biggest economies in Asia, and the data reflected similar gloom across the rest of the region.  National Australia Bank group chief economist Alan Oster described Asia's economic health as 'in a word, poor - and decelerating quickly'.  'One of the big problems is when we look at industrial production and GDP across the region, we see quite rapid declines,' Oster told AFP.  Many of the region's national economies were 'trade-exposed' and faced growing problems as global fortunes declined, he said.  'We broadly see the global economy as going into a period where 2009 looks like its going to be the worst year since World War II.'  Singapore reported on Wednesday it was facing its worst-ever recession after the economy contracted by 16.9 per cent in the final quarter, its biggest fall on record.  In China, as many as six million people from the countryside have lost their jobs in the cities because of the economic crisis, the National Bureau of Statistics said as it released the economic data for 2008.
