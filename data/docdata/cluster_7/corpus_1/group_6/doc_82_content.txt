The incoming administration has pledged to rebuild America, and housing data this week will shed light on how much work is needed.On Thursday, two days after Barack Obama takes office, the government will report on housing starts for December, and analysts expect a new record low.'The lethal combination of tight credit conditions, declining household wealth, falling home values, excessively high inventory levels and rising unemployment will once again restrain housing activity,' according to Bank of America analysts. For November, the Commerce Department reported that U.S. home builders slashed construction of new dwellings, with starts falling 18.9% to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 625,000, the lowest since records began in 1959. Analysts polled by MarketWatch are looking for an even worse result for December -- an annual rate of 600,000.While lower starts are bad news for jobs, cuts are needed to winnow down the over supply.Analysts at IHS Global Insight expect a 'mild drop' in starts for December.'Going forward, starts and permits will continue to drop over the first half of this year, but a second-half rebound is likely, provided financial markets continue to thaw and interest rates remain low,' according to a research note from Global Insight.On Wednesday, the Senate Finance Committee meets about the nomination of Timothy Geithner as Secretary of the Treasury. Obama has said he expects Geithner to be confirmed, despite some recent controversy involving Geithner's initial failure to pay some taxes and a housekeeper who briefly worked for Geithner without proper immigration papers.
