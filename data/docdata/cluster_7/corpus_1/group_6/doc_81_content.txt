The Australian dollar has ended the local session slightly higher as firmer equity markets outweighed poor economic data from key trading partner South Korea.  At 1700 AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at 65.68/73 US cents, up from Wednesday's close of 65.52/55. It was also buying 58.4 yen, 50.4 euro cents and 47 pence.  During the day, the currency moved between 65.22 US cents and 66.41.  The domestic currency started the local session on the front foot, following Wall Street's strong close to reach its intra day-high of 66.41 US cents.  The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 3.5% and the Nasdaq composite index rose 4.6%.  Forecast senior currency analyst, Lee Wai Tuck, said positive sentiment on Asian equity markets helped boost the appeal of risk-sensitive currencies such as the Australian dollar.  Australian share markets ended firmer, with the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index closing up 1.28% and the broader All Ordinaries index 1.09% higher.  ''With Asian stock markets firmer today, we have some demand for those higher-yielding units against the yen,'' Mr Lee said from Singapore.  ''The Aussie is still recovering from yesterday's low.''  But the first contraction in South Korea's economy for a decade soured market sentiment on the Australian dollar, with the commodities-driven currency hitting its day low a few hours after the release of the Korean data.  South Korea is Australia's third-largest export market.  The Bank of Korea reported the nation's economy contracted 5.6% in the fourth quarter of 2008.  That nation's economy last shrank on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter of 1998, at the end of the Asian economic crisis.  For all of 2008, South Korea's economy grew 2.5%, its slowest performance since a contraction of 6.9% in 1998.  ''The GDP data of minus 5.6% was the worst since 1998,'' Mr Lee said.  ''It was one of the reasons why the Aussie came off.''  China and Japan also reported poor economic keys, although both results were in line with forecasts. China's GDP grew 6.8% in the December quarter, its weakest pace in seven years, while Japan's exports slumped 35% in December.  Mr Lee said the Australian dollar would take its lead from equity markets in the US and the UK in Thursday's offshore session.  If markets remain stable, the Australian dollar could reach 66.20-30 US cents, he said.  Economic data due for release in the US on Thursday include housing starts and building permits, both for December.  At 1600 AEDT, the Reserve Bank of Australia's trade weighted index was at 54.2, up from Wednesday's close of 53.9.
