: RBI has reduced GDP growth expectations for 2008-09 to 7%, a drop from the previous 7.5-8%. A few days earlier, the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council reduced the growth forecast for 2008-09 to 7.1% from 7.7%. However, most external projections assume growth of between 6.5% and 7% in 2008-09. No one knows how bad the macro news is. For Q1 and Q2 of 2008-09, GDP growth figures from CSO were 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively. Q3 figures wont surface before February 2009 and until then, one wont know the impact of global recession and slowdown. How bad will 2009-10 be? Montek Singh Ahluwalia said the Planning Commission reviewed assorted econometric models and decided global slowdown would shave off between 1.5% and 2.5% from baseline growth. On a base of 7.5%, after netting out the effects of tight monetary policy, which reduced growth before the global crisis, this means GDP growth of between 5% and 6%. The range of forecasts by assorted institutions (Assocham, Allianz, Morgan Stanley, Citibank, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Nomura, World Bank and IMF) is between 5.3% and 6.5%, with IMF also having reduced its forecast for calendar year 2009 to the 5% range. Icriers 3.9% is only for the first half of 2009-10.  Except for the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council, no one inside the government has given a firm projection for GDP growth in 2009-10. RBI has said that 2009-10 will be worse than 2008-09; the Prime Minister has also suggested something along similar lines. However, the Economic Advisory Council has projected 7% to 7.5% in 2009-10, with 7% during first half and 7.5% during the second. This is difficult to swallow. The council believes that the savings rate will be 31% and investment rate 32%, both reduced by 4% from baseline figures and the council presumably expects consumption to increase because of agricultural growth, NREGA and Pay Commission awards. With an incremental capital output ratio of 4, we should then get 8% growth. But the recent increase in savings hasnt only been in the household sector. There have been significant contributions from public and private corporate sectors. Within the household sector, the increase has occurred as financial savings, not physical savings. Question marks are greater for investments. Investments have been driven by the public and private corporate sectors. There are no signs yet that monetary policy changes have had the desired impact and there is a...
