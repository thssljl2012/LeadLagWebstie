SYDNEY, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Australian consumer prices fell by the most in a decade last quarter as a steep drop in petrol helped pull annual inflation down sharply, signalling scope for another aggressive cut in interest rates next week. Measures of underlying inflation favoured by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) rose by a shade less than expected in the fourth quarter. The central bank aims to keep inflation in a 2-3 percent band over the long run. --------------------------------------------------------------- KEY POINTS: - Q4 consumer price index -0.3 pct q/q (market forecast -0.4 pct) - Q4 consumer price index +3.7 pct y/y (forecast +3.6 pct) - Q4 trimmed mean +0.6 pct q/q (forecast +0.8 pct) - Q4 trimmed mean +4.2 pct y/y (forecast +4.4 pct) - Q4 weighted median +0.9 pct q/q (forecast +0.8 pct) - Q4 weighted median +4.5 pct y/y (forecast +4.4 pct) - Click on for a brief story. COMMENTARY: JOHN EDWARDS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, HSBC 'The numbers are as expected, at least for the headline. It removes any conceivable impediment to the RBA cutting rates next week by 75 basis points. The most important point about the result is the trimmed mean CPI is up 0.6 percent, which is half of the increase for the previous quarter. It means in an annualised sense, underlying inflation is back within the RBA's band. Inflation is no longer a problem.' MARKET REACTION: - The Australian dollar held steady after the data. Bond and bill futures edged up as the data only reinforced expectations for another sizable cut in interest rates at the RBA's monthly policy meeting next week.

Analysts tend to average the two measures to arrive at a general level for underlying inflation. - The RBA has already anticipated a slowdown in inflation by cutting its key cash rate by 3 percentage points since September, taking it to a six-year low of 4.25 percent in an effort to cushion Australia from global recession. - The central bank holds its monthly policy meeting on Feb. 3 and releases its quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy on Feb. 6 (Reporting by Sydney newsroom) Keywords: AUSTRALIA ECONOMY/VIEW (wayne.cole@reuters.com ; +61 2 9373 1813; Reuters Messaging: wayne.cole.reuters.com@reuters.net ) COPYRIGHT Copyright Thomson Reuters 2009.
