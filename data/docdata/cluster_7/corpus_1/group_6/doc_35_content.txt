Sterling staged a strong rally on speculation Bank of England rates could finally be approaching their low point.  The pound added to its recent gains, jumping 1.3 per cent against the euro before hitting 1.11 euros - the highest level in nearly a month. It traded at $1.52 against the dollar.  The BoE surprised many traders by cutting the Bank Rate by half a point to 1.5 per cent - less than the one point cut many City economists were calling for.  The ever-dipping sterling finally rallied - for now - after the Bank of England's latest rate cut  Analysts said that the smaller-than-expected reduction could be a sign Governor Mervyn King and his colleagues do not want to see dramatic further sterling declines.  The pound suffered 25 per cent slumps against the euro and the dollar last year, but it has shown signs of stabilising in 2009.  Economist Matthew Sharratt of Bank of America said: 'Sterling's declines argue for a go-slow scenario. It seems that its fall was one of the reasons the Bank of England took its foot off the accelerator.'  The Bank said in a statement yesterday that the currency decline 'may help to moderate' the pain being wrought by the economic downturn.  But analysts say that if sterling continues to stumble, overseas investors could lose their appetite for UK  government debt.  That would make it harder for the Treasury to fund its prodigious borrowing requirement.  Yesterday's reduction puts official rates at their lowest level since the BoE was founded in 1694.  While economists say the Monetary Policy Committee could trim another half-point from rates in February, the emphasis now will switch to more unorthodox ways of  propping up the economy.  The BoE hinted at this in its statement, saying that continued falls in the supply of credit point to the need for 'further measures' to increase the flow of lending.  The Bank failed to spell out what these measures could include. But the Treasury is drawing up a range of possible moves including new guarantees or capital injections.  Chancellor Alistair Darling has suggested the Bank and Treasury could join forces and embark on radical deflation-fighting measures.  Roger Bootle, economic adviser to accountants Deloitte, said: 'To prevent a depression and persistent deflation, the MPC needs to go the whole hog and cut rates to zero.  'And once it has done that, it will have to resort to other measures designed to boost the quantity of money in the economy and lower longer-term rates of interest.'
