Consumer prices fell for the first time in two years during the December quarter due to lower prices for petrol, cars, health products and financial services.  The consumer price index fell 0.3 per cent in the December quarter, the biggest drop since September 1997, data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.  Mr Swan said the moderation in underlying inflation compared to recent quarters also suggested that inflation pressures were easing more broadly. 'While the annual inflation rate remains high, this reflects inflationary pressures from earlier in 2008,' he said. 'Inflation is expected to continue to ease over the next six to 12 months, as the full effect of weaker world economic conditions flows through.' The annual inflation rate fell to 3.7 per cent from 5.0 per cent in the 12 months to September, dragging it back towards the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) two to three per cent target band.  The average of the RBA's weighted median and trimmed mean underlying measures rose 0.75 per cent in the December quarter compared to 1.25 per cent growth in the previous quarter.  But this cut the average underlying annual rate to 4.35 per cent from 4.7 per cent in the 12 months to September.  Mr Swan warned there had been a rapid slowdown in the global economy. 'The sort of data we are now seeing, internationally, for the December quarter in terms of many developed countries is very stark, very stark,' he said. 'The premium now is to support jobs and to support growth and to support jobs and this government puts an absolute emphasis on supporting growth and jobs.' The treasurer said the government's $10.4 billion economic stimulus package delivered in December had a beneficial impact in terms of consumption.
