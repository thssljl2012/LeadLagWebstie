THE Australian dollar was weaker at noon as increased expectations of lower interest rates and negative economic data hit the high-yielding currency.  At 12.00pm (AEDT), the dollar was trading at $US0.6471/76, down 1.92 per cent from Thursday's close of $US0.6599/02.   During the morning, the currency moved between $US0.6468 and $US0.6525.   ABN Amro currency strategist, Greg Gibbs, said the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's decision to slash its key interest rate by 150 basis points on Thursday continued to raise market's expectations of another aggressive rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on Tuesday, February 3. 'The dollar is trending lower, reflecting the interest rate outlook that opened up more risk of (rate) cuts post the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's decision yesterday,'' Mr Gibbs said. 'That continues to play a role.''   Since September, the RBA has lowered the cash rate by 300 basis points, to 4.25 per cent, in a bid to stimulate a slowing economy.   Mr Gibbs said the RBA was more likely to cut by 100 basis points, following Thursday's decision in New Zealand.   Mr Gibbs said the economic data around the world had been 'atrocious'', with Japan's latest data not helpful towards the dollar.   Japanese unemployment jumped to 4.4 per cent in December from 3.9 per cent in November, official figures show.   Industrial output in Japan plunged a record 9.6 per cent in December from the previous month, the biggest drop since records were released in 1953. 'The Japanese data this morning was very weak,'' Mr Gibbs said.   Private sector credit fell 0.3 per cent in December, the first montly decline since 1992, RBA data showed.   Credit growth was 6.7 per cent for the year to December, down from an annual pace of 16.4 per cent 12 months before. 'In this environment, it's hard to say anything positive for the Australian dollar,'' Mr Gibbs said.   Mr Gibbs said the dollar would remain under pressure for the rest of the local session, with the risk of hitting mid-$US0.63.   At 12.00pm the Reserve Bank's trade weighted index was at 53.5, down from Thursday's close of 54.7.   The bond market was mixed at noon.   The yield on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was at 4.090 per cent, up from Thursday's close of 4.077 per cent, while the yield on the April 2012 bond was at 2.918 per cent, down from 2.965 per cent.   On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March 10-year bond futures contract price was 95.910, down from Thursday's close of 95.925, while the March three-year bond futures contract price was at 97.060, up from 97.025.
