Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has pledged $4 billion for a lending fund for commercial property companies to stabilise financial markets should foreign banks fail to roll over as much as $75 billion in business loans.  The Government will provide $2 billion and the remainder will come from the nation's four largest banks - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, ANZ, Westpac, and NAB, a spokeswoman for Mr Rudd said this morning.  A shortfall in credit could push Australia's economy into its first recession since 1991, worsening a surge in job cuts at companies including BHP Billiton following a drop in demand from China and waning consumer spending. Governments in the US and Europe are bolstering measures to underwrite bank lending after recapitalisation efforts failed to restore credit flow.  The new fund will only offer loans to companies on commercial terms when the Government and the banks agree the property assets and income would be economically viable. It could be used to refinance existing syndicated loans if a member of the lending group withdraws, it said. The fund may also lend up to another $26 billion for commercial property projects by government guaranteed debt.  Overseas banks accounted for more than half the $285 billion in syndicated loans issued to Australian businesses since 2006, Mr Rudd said this week, citing Merrill Lynch figures. About $75 billion is due to be rolled over in the next two years.  Stimulus  Since October, Mr Rudd and Treasurer Wayne Swan have announced almost $45 billion in aid for families, pensioners, bond markets, home buyers, and extra spending on schools and roads to boost growth in the economy.  The spending boost came after credit markets froze following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, prompting governments and central banks around the world to bail out financial institutions and try to revive growth.
