(CEP News) Frankfurt - The European Central Bank's Governing Council has decided to cut its main refinancing rate by 50 basis points to 2.00% on Thursday, as expected by a majority of economists and analysts. Including this most recent cut, the central bank has trimmed rates by a total of 225 basis points since October 2008. 'Although the ECB still seems reluctant to ease rates much further, we do expect the bad data to convince the ECB that a 50bp cut is required on January 15,' Bank of America's Gilles Moec said ahead of the rate annoucement. The ECB also announced that, from Jan. 21, its marginal lending rate would be set at 3.00%, while the deposit rate would fall to 1.00%.
