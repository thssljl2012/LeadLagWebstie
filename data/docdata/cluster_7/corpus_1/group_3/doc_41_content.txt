OPPOSITION Leader Malcolm Turnbull has backed the government's strategy, saying it provides particular justice to pensioners.Mr Turnbull said today's announcement was a 'very significant' economic stimulus.'We trust that the government has taken into account advice from Treasury and considered the impact that this stimulus may have on the Reserve Bank's ability to continue to reduce interest rates,'' Mr Turnbull told reporters in Canberra.'But nonetheless, we're not going to argue with the composition of the package or quibble about it, it has our support, it will provide a stimulus to the economy, that's for certain, and above all it gives justice to Australia's aged pensioners in particular.''The Reserve Bank of Australia last week cut the official cash rate by a surprise full percentage point.Financial markets are predicting further rate cuts before the end of the year.'The RBA may view the extra fiscal pump-priming as negating the need for some of the forecast monetary policy easing,'' TD Securities senior strategist Joshua Williamson said today.
