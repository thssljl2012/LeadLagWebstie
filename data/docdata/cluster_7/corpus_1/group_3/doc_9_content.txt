The banks have refused to give any detail as to why they can't pass on the benefits of an interest rate cut, opposition Treasury spokeswoman Julie Bishop says.The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to hand down an interest rate cut of half a percentage point Tuesday, but the banks have indicated they won't be able to pass on the cut because of costs.'The banks have clearly convinced (federal Treasurer) Wayne Swan that they need the benefit of the rate cut rather than passing it onto say small business borrowers or mortgage holders, but we don't have any of that detail as to why the banks cannot afford to pass on the benefit of an interest rate cut,' Ms Bishop told ABC radio.'The banks did complain of higher borrowing costs earlier in the year and increased their margins on the official cash rate by half a percentage point.'That margin has been maintained and the banks went on to make a record profit throughout this year.'There were also mixed messages coming from Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Mr Swan, Ms Bishop said.'Given that Kevin Rudd is talking of the need to pump-prime the economy, for a $20-billion infrastructure fund, it's confusing when Wayne Swan says that it's more important to protect the banks' profit than stimulate the economy, when he's talking of an interest rate cut.'It's important that the banks remain profitable, but at a time when the economy needed to be stimulated, the question was how much of the cut the banks could pass on, she said.'And we've heard very little from the banks.'Ms Bishop said the opposition's offer to sit down with the government on a bipartisan level to discuss the economic situation was rejected.'So we are dealing with the available evidence and the available evidence shows that the banks are highly profitable and could afford to pass on an interest rate cut to those people who desperately need it.'Meanwhile, the Australian Industry Group has echoed the federal government's sentiment.AIG chief executive Heather Ridout said the banks should endeavour to pass on any interest rate cut in full, but it might not be practicable.Ms Ridout described the current economic climate as 'very unusual and problematic'.She said if the banks did not fully pass on any interest rate cut, they would owe the public an explanation.'If (passing on a cut in full) is not practicable then in the interests of transparency the banks should seek to give some explanation for their actions and put some substance around their reasons for not doing so,' Ms Ridout said.She said there was a strong case for a cut in official interest rates with a slowing in the manufacturing, services and constructions sectors.'A faster winding back of the restrictive monetary policy adopted over the past year is now due,' she said
