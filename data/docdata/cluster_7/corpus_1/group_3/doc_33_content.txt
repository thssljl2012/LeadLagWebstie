 Market watch top headlines Australian reports Aust markets:  :  :  World reports World commodities:  World markets:   NHF, CMJ, MCP, GPT, AAP 2008-10-27 Investment house Argo Investments Ltd says its earnings have been impacted by the equity market meltdown which will continue to squeeze its profits and dividends for the foreseeable future.Chairman Chris Harris told the company's annual general meeting in Adelaide that global market volatility continued to make investment decisions difficult, with fundamental earnings and valuations being overwhelmed by macroeconomic events. 'Falling interest rates and input costs should provide some relief from slower revenue growth as the economy contracts but company profits and dividends are likely to remain under some pressure in the foreseeable future,' Mr Harris said. 'With cash reserves of around $220 million and no debt, Argo remains in a strong position, well prepared to capitalise on opportunities as they present themselves in the market.' Managing director Rob Patterson said the company had spent about $80 million on investments since June 30, the largest being in explosives firm Orica Ltd, Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd, mining giant Rio Tinto Ltd and bauxite miner Alumina Ltd. 'Argo's total portfolio return for the (2007/08) year was negative 15.3 per cent, mainly reflecting our underweight position in energy and natural resource companies, which considerably outperformed the overall market,' Mr Patterson said. 'While we have increased our energy and natural resource exposures in recent years, we have also been mindful of the much lower dividend yields from these companies.' Mr Harris said there was 'some cause for cautious optimism' despite slowing growth in the economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China. 'Over the longer term, the continued industrialisation and growth outlook for these developing countries, particularly China and India, remains solid and Australia's proximity as a trading partner to Asia is of long-term strategic benefit,' he said. Argo Investment recently announced a 23 per cent increase in net operating profit, for the 12 months to June 30, to $182.3 million, excluding gains made on the sale of shares in its investment portfolio.Including one-off gains made through investments in stocks that were taken over, taking in Coles Group Ltd and Dyno Nobel Ltd, Argo Investment's bottom line profit surged 71.5 per cent to $294.11 million.Shares in Argo Investments were down 19 cents, or 3.07 per cent, at $6.00 at 1415 AEDT.
