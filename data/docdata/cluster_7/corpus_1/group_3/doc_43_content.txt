Housing affordability continued its slight improvement as lower house prices offset a rise in borrowing costs in the September quarter, a survey says.The Housing Industry Association/Commonwealth Bank affordability index rose by three per cent in the September quarter.The average national index of 109.1 points was 1.1 per cent below its level of a year earlier, however.It was the second straight quarter in which housing affordability rose after hitting a record low during the March quarter. The index has been running for 14 years.HIA chief executive Chris Lamont said expected cuts to interest rates in the next few months would make housing more affordable.The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) lowered its cash rate by a quarter of a percentage point to seven per cent on September 2, with the commercial banks passing the fall in full to borrowers.The RBA lowered its key interest rate again, by a full one per cent, to six per cent, on October 7, with markets pricing another like total cut by the end of this year.The latest cut was after the current index period.'First home buyer affordability has been languishing at or near record lows for a long time now, but aggressive interest rate cuts and the additions to the first home owners grant, particularly for new housing, provide some welcome relief,' Mr Lamont said.Monthly mortgage repayments fell by 1.5 per cent to $2,785 in the September quarter from $2,827 during the June quarter.First home buyers used 27.5 per cent of their monthly income to pay their mortgage, down from the June quarter, but it was still the fourth highest proportion of salary required to service a home loan.The HIA said the rate cuts were expected to improve housing affordability in the next report.The September quarter survey found housing affordability rose in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Hobart, and in regional areas of Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania.Mr Lamont said the federal government's recent trebling in its first home owners grant for new houses to $21,000 would lift the confidence of buyers hoping to enter the housing market.
