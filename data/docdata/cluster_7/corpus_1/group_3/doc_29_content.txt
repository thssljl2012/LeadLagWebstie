He says while exports to Europe and the US are likely to suffer, the current economic volatility gives China more strength to drive prices down.'We're in an environment of a global slow down with the most risks in the global economy since the 1930s,' he said. 'If the Chinese can't negotiate a better price for their products now, they never can.'
