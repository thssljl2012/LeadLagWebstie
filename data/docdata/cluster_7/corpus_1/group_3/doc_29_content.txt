THE Australian finance industry is poised for its most dramatic round of consolidation since the so-called 'Big Bang' mergers of the early 1980s after the Commonwealth Bank pitched a bid for BankWest.Sources confirmed that a CBA offer of more than $3 billion to buy the Perth-based bank was rejected in the past week by its troubled British owner, HBOS.While the offer has since been withdrawn by CBA, the move is confirmation that HBOS has put its Australian assets up for sale.Other bids are now expected from local banks and possibly foreign players, including the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC).The consolidation game being played out is the biggest since 1982 when a series of mergers produced the empires of Westpac and National Australia Bank.Westpac is likely to augment its empire in December with the acquisition of St George.BankWest is a preferred acquisition target of CBA and ANZ despite growing speculation that Brisbane-based Suncorp was also now open to takeover offers.Suncorp is the least preferred target simply because it is a more complex business with footholds in commercial insurance, funds management and life protection.Any bank desperate to snare Suncorp's banking operations would need to find a buyer of the general insurance business before mounting a firm bid with QBE tipped as a likely partner.Speculation has been rife in the past week that HBOS was preparing to sell its Australian operations to bolster its cash-strapped balance sheet.HBOS, which is in the midst of merging with British rival Lloyds TSB, has come under severe financial pressure this year as the global credit crunch has intensified.Suncorp is also dealing with emerging bad debt problems through its exposure to the Queensland property sector.But the group has encountered big liquidity problems this year as it has scrambled to unearth alternative funding sources to the international securitisation market which has all but frozen up.This gap in the bank's funding mix has forced Suncorp's board to review its long-held strategic policy of operating as an independent provider of financial services.Suncorp scrip yesterday outperformed all other bank stocks, rising 42 or 4.3 per cent to $10.03.
