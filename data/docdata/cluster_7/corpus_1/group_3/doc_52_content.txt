British homeowners have finally been given some relief after four major mortgage lenders pledged to pass on the half per cent interest rates cut.Halifax, Lloyds-TSB, Barclays and the RBS group, which includes Natwest - cut their standard variable rates by 0.5 per cent after rates were slashed around the world.However, many big names including the Nationwide and Abbey remained silent and today there was a fresh blow as new figures showed a record plunge in house prices.The latest data from the Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, revealed prices have tumbled 13.2 per cent since this time last year.The 13.2 per cent drop is the largest ever recorded by its price index, which posted a year-on-year decline of 12.7 per cent in August.Annual house price inflation, which compares prices over the past three months with the same period last year, also dropped to a record low.The plunge of 12.4 per cent takes the average cost of a home down to 172,108, although there are signs the fall could now finally be stabilising.Property values only fell 1.3 per cent last month, the smallest fall since February, and the 5.2 per cent drop in the third quarter of the year was in line with the 5.1 per cent fall in the second quarter.

Martin Ellis, Halifax chief economist, said: 'The overall price decrease in the three months to September was very similar to that in the previous quarter, indicating that the trend rate of decline may be beginning to stabilise.'The ongoing pressures on householders' income, combined with the reduction in the availability of mortgage finance, however, mean that market conditions will remain challenging.'  The Bank of England, U.S. Federal Reserve and European Central Bank yesterday announced the rate reduction within minutes of each other.The emergency cut - taking the UK base rate to 4.5 per cent - was the first coordinated move since the terrorist catastrophe of September 11, 2001.City analysts believe further aggressive cuts will be necessary, with some predicting the base rate will plummet to a 50-year low of 3 per cent next year.The Bank of England brought forward the cut by a day amid intense pressure to tackle the economic crunch which has already cost thousands of jobs in banks and retail.The decision, coupled with the Government's 500billion finance-sector rescue package, puts banks on the spot.They are under pressure to repay the help by both cutting interest rates and ending the lending drought which is crippling business, the housing market and the high street.Passing on the full half-point rate reduction will leave a homebuyer with a 150,000 variablerate mortgage 47 a month better off.The shock cut in borrowing triggered suspicions that the Bank's supposedly independent Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets rates, had succumbed to political pressure.  The Prime Minister announced the news in the House of Commons at the same time as the Bank of England made details public.Gordon Brown told MPs: 'We are showing we will do everything in our power to maintain the stability of the economy in the interest of every single British person.'However, Tory leader David Cameron said the test will be whether banks pass on the benefits to home-buyers and business.He challenged the Prime Minister: 'Aren't they the real tests that need to be met and can you explain how you will be measuring whether they are met?'News of the rate cut followed crisis talks between Mr Brown, Chancellor Alistair Darling, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King and the heads of the Financial Services Authority.Apart from the cuts in Britain, Europe and the U.S., central banks in Canada, Sweden, Switzerland and China also reduced the cost of borrowing.The moves were welcomed by business leaders, retailers and City analysts, although many argued for more.The decision risks increasing inflation, which is expected to top 5 per cent when the official figures are published next week.However, business leaders insist the risk of recession - even a 1930s style Depression - is far more real.The MPC insisted the decision was taken independently and justified the need for the emergency cut by issuing a statement offering a dire analysis of the economy.Economist Roger Bootle, adviser to Deloitte, said interest rates might have to fall to a record low of 2 per cent to give the economy the kiss of life.
