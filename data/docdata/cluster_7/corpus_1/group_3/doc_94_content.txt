The US Federal Reserve cut a key interest rate by half a percentage point today to steady an economy teetering on the kind of financial collapse that the United States suffered in 1929.Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his colleagues ratcheted down their key rate by half a percentage point to 1.5 per cent. The action revives the central banks rate-cutting campaign which had been halted in June out of concerns that those low rates would worsen inflation. Since then, however, economic and financial conditions have dangerously deteriorated, forcing the Fed to reverse course.The fact that the Fed felt it couldnt wait until its regularly scheduled meeting on October 28-29 underscored the urgency of the situation.The Fed took the action in a coordinated move with other central banks, which also were cutting their rates.The Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Sweden and China cut their official rates today, a day after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut its cash rate by one percentage point to 6.0 per cent.The pace of economic activity has slowed markedly in recent months, the Fed said. Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit.Although inflation has been high, the Fed believes that the recent drop in energy prices and the weaker prospects for economic activity have reduced this threat to the economy.
