 Blocked funds worth about $3.3bn  COLONIAL First State has suspended daily withdrawals from its some of its funds, after the Federal Government's bank deposit guarantee prompted some investors to take out their money.Colonial First State, which is the fund management arm of Commonwealth Bank, said the sudden actions of other fund managers to suspend fund redemptions have had a roll on effect on its mortgage funds, causing an increased level of redemptions in the last few days. 'Although Colonial First State has continued to prudently manage its mortgage funds, given these developments in the marketplace, it is in the best interests of all investors in Colonial First State's mortgage funds to suspend these funds,' it said. 'This decision will enable Colonial First State to take a measured approach to processing withdrawals in an orderly fashion.The funds affected are worth approximately $3.3 billion. They are Colonial First State Wholesale Income Fund, FirstChoice Wholesale Income option, FirstChoice Income option, Managed Investment Funds - Mortgage Income Fund, Bricks and Mortar Fund, Guaranteed Mortgage Fund and the Rollover and Superannuation Fund - Mortgage option.Colonial is the latest in a string of investment funds to freeze withdrawals.At least 13 investment funds not covered by the Government's guarantee have frozen almost $12 billion in assets, leaving investors unable to withdraw their capital.The exodus of funds saw the Government re-jig its scheme last Friday by putting a premium on deposits over $1 million.
