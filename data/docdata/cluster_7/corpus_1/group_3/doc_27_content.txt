 - The big trade surplus in August is a reminder of the tensions at work in the Australian economy.On one hand, the boom in commodity prices is continuing.That was confirmed late on Wednesday when the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said its commodity price index has risen by another 0.5 per cent to another record high.The boom is admittedly becoming a little patchy.Total commodity prices have risen by 47.8 per cent in foreign currency terms over the past year, but base metals prices have fallen by 21 per cent, having peaked in May last year.The RBA does not include iron in its base metals price index.Despite this patchiness, the price rises are flowing through into higher export revenues.Exports of goods and services jumped by $1.486 billion in August, to be $6.044 billion or 33 per cent higher than a year earlier, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said.Within the total, coal exports rose by $943 million to $4.511 billion to be $2.778 billion or 160 per cent higher than a year before.Metal ores and minerals exports have also surged, hitting $4.719 billion in August, $1.573 billion or 50 per cent higher than August last year, thanks in large part to higher iron ore contract prices negotiated earlier in the year.This will act as a stimulus to economic growth, by boosting incomes and fostering increased production and investment in new capacity.In fact the potential for the commodities boom to boost economic growth was a major reason the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) delayed cutting interest rates during the winter while evidence of economic slowdown accumulated relentlessly .The trade figures added to that mountain of evidence.Imports are driven mainly by domestic spending.The August figures showed imports of goods and services fell by $575 million to $23.246 billion, a rise of $2.836 billion or 14 per cent - less than half the rise in exports - over the year.Consumer goods imports stalled after the first quarter of this year and have since fallen in each of the past three months.The trend estimated by the ABS has been flat since April, running in parallel with domestic retail trade which hit the wall at about the same time.Along with some volatility in oil imports, these trends have produced a seasonally adjusted trade surplus of $1.364 billion in August.It was a stunning $2.061 billion turnaround from the $697 million deficit in July.It was also the biggest ever surplus in dollar terms, aside from June 1997 when the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its hoard of gold by $1.8 billion, boosting exports in that month.But the story behind the figures is more important.The forces acting to slow the economy - high interest rates, high oil prices, a high exchange rate, falling share prices and a climate of fear and gloom - are gaining the upper hand.This shift in the balance is not only reflected in the trade figures and other economic indicators, but the policy response.The change in direction of interest rates - an official cut last month, another almost certain next week and probably more in coming months - is one.Moves at the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) meeting in Canberra, just concluded, to fast-track the development of a list of national infrastructure priorities should also be seen as a part of this.
