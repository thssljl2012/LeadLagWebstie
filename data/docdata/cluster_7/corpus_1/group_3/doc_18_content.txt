SYDNEY, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Australia's third-largest lender, raised A$1.081 billion ($853.9 million) in Tier 1 capital, the bank said.ANZ is the fourth Australian bank to raise this type of capital targeting retail investors in 2008, with further issues expected to follow.National Australia Bank (NAB) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) are eyeing similar issues to bolster their balance sheets, according to market sources.NAB is expected to announce a Tier 1 issue after its annual results on Oct. 30. CBA is likely to refinance A$750 million of Tier 1 perpetual exchangeable resettable listed securities (PERLS II) which roll over on March 15, 2009, sources said.ANZ's hybrid offer, whose margin was set in September at 250 basis points over the bank bill swap rate, closed on Tuesday.Around 90 percent of the notes were placed with retail investors with the balance sold to institutions, a joint lead said.The issue, to be rated A+ by S&amp;amp;P and Aa3 by Moody's, was led by an unusually large syndicate of joint leads including ANZ, Citi, CommSec, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs JBWere, JPMorgan, Macquarie and UBS.ABN AMRO Morgans and Credit Suisse acted as co-managers.The issue targeted retail investors by offering franked dividends, which have tax benefits, and was particularly popular because of a lack of hybrid supply in Australia and an attractive return for yield-starved buyers.ANZ's offer is part of a relatively new type of Tier 1 capital, called non-innovative Tier 1, that offers a cheaper form of capital compared with ordinary equity.Banks are required to maintain Tier-1 as a buffer to protect bank deposits.The offer consisted of convertible preference shares (CPS) that will mandatorily convert into ordinary shares with a 2.5 percent discount in June 2014. The maximum conversion number has been set at 11.5274 ANZ ordinary shares per CPS.Dividends on the CPS are preferred, fully franked and non-cumulative. The notes will pay a dividend of 6.8752 percent per year.
