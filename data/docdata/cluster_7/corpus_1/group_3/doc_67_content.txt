Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley was the fourth UK bank to call it a day since the credit crunch started 14 months ago. Three building societies have also shut up shop. In this not so brave new world there will be less choice for both borrowers and savers. Here, we examine the profound effect the banking crisis is having on all our personal finances.HomeownersProperty owners are at the sharp end of the credit squeeze. The number of mortgages to choose from has fallen by more than 1,000 in a year.And even though the Bank of England base rate has dropped from 5.75 per cent to 5 per cent since last August, the price of home loans has bounced up and down with little warning.At the same time, banks and building societies have become far more cautious. They want bigger deposits, job security and have cut the amount they are prepared to lend.Money Mail has commissioned research from data analyst Defaqto which illustrates starkly the extent of the squeeze.In August 2007, homebuyers and remortgagers were able to borrow on average 92 per cent of the property price for a fixed rate home loan, today the average is close to 80 per cent.So even after the 10 per cent fall in property prices, the average first-time buyer must find a 15,000 bigger deposit than a year ago.Homeowners who failed to put down a deposit, or paid only a small fraction of their house cost up-front, are in dire straits.Time running out: Some banks are hanging on by their fingertipsSome have been stranded with negative equity, where their property is worth less than the amount they have borrowed.That's fine if they want to stay put, but moving will be impossible unless they can save a considerable sum. Worse, they now face 'payment shock' when their current fixed rate or discount deal ends.Lenders don't want borrowers with small deposits or none at all, so, rather than remortgaging, they could be forced on to the standard variable rate which can be as high as 7 per cent.For someone who took a typical 4.95 per cent fixed-rate two years ago, that would mean paying an extra 187 a month on a 150,000 mortgage.Even those who can remortgage have less choice. In August 2007, there were 1,595 fixed rate mortgages to choose from, today there are just 1,189. The number of tracker deals available is roughly unchanged, according to Defaqto.And, because of the credit crunch, those deals that are available are expensive.The average two-year fixed rate is at 6.24 per cent, meaning monthly repayments on a typical repayment 150,000 mortgage over 25 years are 989.Leading economists expect aggressive cuts in interest rates with Bank of England base rate falling, possibly to 3.5 pc down from 5 pc, according to consultancy Capital Economics.Under normal conditions economists estimate that fixed-rate deals would now cost around 4.5 per cent, giving repayments on a typical mortgage of 834 a month.This makes the cost of the credit crunch to the average person mortgaging around 155 a month or 3,720 extra over the term of a two-year fix.LandlordsProperty was seen by many as the surefire long-term investment. Some have based their entire retirement strategy on buy-to-let, taking huge mortgages in the hope that they will make thousands as house prices soar.Now they are suffering on two fronts. House prices are down 10 per cent in a year and the number of buy-to-let lenders has fallen by almost one-third, making the market less competitive.There are 1.1 million outstanding buy-to-let mortgages. In total, the banks have lent almost 132.5 billion, most in the form of interest-only mortgages, where property owners pay back just the interest of a loan and not any of the capital.Those lenders that are still in the market are imposing much stricter criteria for buy-to-let loans. In particular, they want bigger deposits and higher rents to cover the mortgage repayments.In August 2007, the minimum deposit for a mortgage was 17.4 per cent, today it is 24 per cent, Defaqto says.And fees have rocketed, too. For a smaller deposit landlords can now expect to pay an up-front fee 3 per cent of the amount they are borrowing - equivalent to 4,500 on a typical 50,000 loan.Many would have mortgages with as little as 10 per cent deposit, and the rent these deals would cover only the mortgage repayments.Today, most lenders would expect the rent to be around 25 per cent their mortgage repayments.As a result of all this, 12,100 landlords have fallen three months behind with their home loans.Before the credit crunch began, the ten biggest lenders of buy-to-let mortgages were Mortgage Express (part of Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley), Birmingham Midshires (part of Halifax/Bank of Scotland), Paragon, Bristol &amp;amp; West (part of Bank of Ireland), Cheltenham &amp;amp; Gloucester (part of Lloyds TSB), Northern Rock, Capital Home Loans, The Mortgage Works (part of Nationwide BS), The Mortgage Business (part of Halifax/ Bank of Scotland) and Barclays.Today, of these, Capital Home Loans and Paragon are not currently lending new money, Mortgage Express and Northern Rock have been nationalised, Birmingham Midshires is to become part of Lloyds TSB and The Mortgage Business has closed.'There is a real double whammy here of rising rates and a toughening of criteria. So while rental income and demand for rented housing is still high, you just can't borrow as much,' says David Hollingworth, from brokers London &amp;amp; Country.To add to these woes, interest rates on buy-to-let are also stubbornly high.The average two-year fixed rate has barely changed over the year at 6.42 per cent, putting monthly repayments on a typical 150,000 interest-only deal at 802, the average three-year fixed rate has risen from 6.56 per cent (repayments of 820) to 6.89 per cent (repayments of 861), and the average five-year fixed rate has increased from 6.53 per cent (repayments of 816) to 6.76 per cent (repayments of 845).SaversThe loss of another building society is bad news for savers. Rates on Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley accounts, which are generally higher than on equivalent Abbey accounts, are likely to be cut back at some stage.Recent mergers and takeovers will mean less competition for your money and lower interest rates. Already FirstSave, part of the First Bank of Nigeria UK, has cut its leading internet account by 0.26 percentage points from today.And top-paying High Street accounts from both Halifax and Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley could disappear. The situation will be made worse as the Bank of England cuts the general level of interest rates.Savers should grab fixed-rate deals. AA Savings (part of HBOS) is a best buy at 5.77 per cent after tax (7.21 per cent) for one year.Anglo Irish pays 5.64 per cent (7.05 per cent) for one year or 5.6 per cent (7 per cent) for two years.The Post Office is launching a one-year fixed-rate bond at 5.4 per cent (6.75 per cent) today. With Anglo Irish and Post Office, where the deposit-taker is Bank of Ireland, all your money is guaranteed until September 28, 2010.Be wary of variable rate accounts for large banks which have a record of treating savers shabbily.On internet accounts, the best of the Big Four comes from NatWest at 3.38 per cent after tax (4.22 per cent before tax) on 5,000 - well below rates paid by Halifax, Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley and Alliance &amp;amp; Leicester.Even Abbey at 3.36 per cent (4.2 per cent) once the initial bonus is stripped out is a poor deal.Building societies offer much better deals. Nationwide e-Savings pays 4.04 per cent (5.05 per cent) and Yorkshire BS Internet Saver 4.56 per cent (5.7 per cent).Barclays, Halifax and Abbey have all cut rates they pay to some savers this summer, even though Bank of England base rate has stayed at 5 per cent since April.
