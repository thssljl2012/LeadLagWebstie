Royal Bank of Scotland is expected to announce billions of pounds of fresh writedowns due to a further deterioration in the value of risky assets as the financial crisis deepens.Analysts' forecasts for additional writedowns range from 1bn to more than 3bn. Edinburgh-based RBS wrote down 5.9bn in the first half of the year and is expected to reveal more for the second half when it releases a prospectus for a rights issue later this week. Shareholders will be offered 15 billion of new shares, with the government buying any shares that investors do not want. advertisement The prospectus, due by the end of this month, is expected to be released on Friday.Sandy Chen, analyst at Panmure, forecasts RBS will lose 6.8bn on writedowns and impairments in the second half, although that figure includes losses on traditional bank lending as well as structured credit.Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette &amp;amp; Woods last week estimated RBS will post another 2bn of writedowns, Cazenove has estimated the bank will take another 3bn and Fox-Pitt Kelton is estimating 1bn. The new writedowns are likely to be focused on the structured credit portfolio, where values of securities linked to tarnished US housing assets have fallen in value.RBS declined to comment, but warned on October 13 that conditions had deteriorated and said its second-half profits would fall short of analysts' expectations. 'We expect that the deterioration in economic and financial market conditions may lead to a rise in impairment charges and further asset writedowns in the fourth quarter,' the bank said then.RBS is also expected to follow Barclays and raise funds from bonds backed by the government once its prospectus is released.Barclays raised 3 billion euros from the sale of three-year bonds and is the only bank to so far take advantage of the government guarantee, for which banks pay a fee to the Treasury.Strong interest in the Barclays offer - which attracted demand for over 4 billion euros of bonds and was placed with 167 investors - lifted optimism the bonds could help unfreeze funding markets blocked up during the credit crisis.
