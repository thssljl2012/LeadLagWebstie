 PHILLIP COOREY CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENTKEVIN RUDD has sought and received a personal assurance from the Chinese Premier, Wen Jiabao, that China's demand for exports would remain strong enough to prop up the Australian economy in the face of the global slowdown.Mr Rudd revealed the call yesterday as the Opposition Leader, Malcolm Turnbull, claimed credit for the 0.8 percentage point interest rate reduction the major banks agreed to pass on, following the Reserve Bank's decision on Wednesday to cut rates by a full percentage point.The Opposition spokesman on finance, Joe Hockey, berated the Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens, for raising interest rates during the election campaign while the Howard government was warning of an economic slowdown because of the growing international crisis.With the rapidly slowing global economy now a reality, Mr Rudd said he rang Mr Wen at 9pm on Monday to quiz him about his growth projections for China. Mr Rudd said he was told growth would slip from 'something like 11 and 12 per cent down to 9 and 10 per cent', still strong enough to sustain a healthy demand for Australian commodity exports.Outlining his reasons for the rate cut on Tuesday, Mr Stevens warned of 'significant moderation in growth in Australia's trading partners in Asia' and some decline in commodity exports and prices.Mr Rudd believes China is the greatest militating factor against the global crisis and said the Communist nation was 'now critical for Australia's continued economic performance'.'Part of the long-term strategy of this Government, and the strategy for the period immediately ahead, is how to more deeply and broadly engage with the Chinese economy,' he said.The Treasurer, Wayne Swan, said there was no need for immediate panic over commodity exports because the record high prices Australia was receiving for iron ore and coal were locked in until March and spot prices were relatively high.Mr Turnbull, who was surprised by the size of the Reserve Bank's rate cut, insisted yesterday that the banks were profitable enough to pass it on in full. He cited the Commonwealth Bank's $2 billion bid for BankWest as evidence they had plenty of money.Mr Turnbull said the pressure he had exerted in the lead-up to the rate decision led the banks to pass on 0.80 percentage points.'I've got no doubt that it was our pressure  that has encouraged the banks to pass on more than perhaps they would have liked to,' he said, though he was 'not taking credit for any particular amount of it'.Mr Swan said Mr Turnbull was delusional and that 'the whole world revolves around his ego'.The Queensland Premier, Anna Bligh, backed Mr Turnbull by saying the banks should explain why they were not passing on the full cut.Since November 7 the Reserve Bank has increased rates three times and reduced them twice. The reduction on Tuesday came despite high inflation. Mr Hockey said the Government and the Reserve had 'badly misread all of this'.He said he was angry at the November 7 rate rise, which had further cruelled the Coalition's election prospects. 'The Reserve Bank needs to answer some questions about what they knew and what they were aware of late last year, and the House of Economics Committee will properly quiz them on that,' he said.
