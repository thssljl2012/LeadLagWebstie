  The sharp fall in the Australian dollar will support economic growth as it will relieve pressure on exporters and import exposed industries, Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner says.The Australian dollar was trading at a five-and-a-half-year low around 60.20 US cents today, having failed to gain much traction from buying intervention from the Reserve Bank of Australia.The currency has dropped about 37 per cent from a peak in July of 98.49 US cents.On balance that's a good thing, because we have seen a lot of people in export industries and import exposed industries that have been really squeezed by the high dollar, Mr Tanner radio this morning.They're getting some welcome relief now and that will contribute to greater economic activity in the economy.So it has some downsides, there is no question about that, but in the current circumstances it is an important stabiliser to help to keep growth and employment ticking over.He said the dollar has been specifically targeted because it was very much connected to commodity prices.The world sees our dollar as an indicator of the prices of minerals and we have seen of course those prices at record levels in recent times and the Australian dollar was a near record levels too, he said.Now, because world growth is slowing, the demand for those commodities has dropped, therefore the prices are dropping and our dollar is dropping with it.
