Financial institutions on Wednesday began offering savings accounts for first home buyers eligible for a federal government cash handout of up to $850 a year.The first home saver accounts are available at major institutions across the country, including ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, AMP, Members Equity and several credit unions.However, consumer group Choice warns potential savers that not all the accounts are the same and that interest rates offered vary.The government will provide a 17 per cent contribution - or $850 - on the first $5,000 of individual contributions made each year.Housing Minister Tanya Plibersek said the government is investing $1.2 billion to help young people save for their first homes through these accounts. 'The biggest barrier to home ownership is saving a deposit and first home saver accounts will bring the dream of home ownership closer for hundreds of thousands of Australians,' Ms Plibersek said. 'First home saver accounts are a practical way for young people to save a bigger deposit for a modest first home.' The deal also offers a low tax rate of 15 per cent - the equivalent of superannuation accounts.This means a couple both earning average incomes, putting 10 per cent of their income in the new accounts, will be able to save more than $88,000 after five years depending on interest rate returns.This is almost $13,000 more than they would have saved in a standard variable savings account.However, Choice has discovered not all of these accounts are created equal. 'Consumers need to be aware that not only do interest rates on offer differ but the way interest is calculated can make a big difference to the final deposit that's saved,' Choice spokesman Christopher Zinn said. 'For example, ANZ pays 6.99 per cent interest in months when regular savers make a deposit, but in other months accounts earn just 0.01 per cent.' Mr Zinn said the Commonwealth Bank's interest rate is also currently below the Reserve Bank of Australia's cash rate and interest is credited annually instead of the preferred monthly or quarterly regime.Also, some accounts may penalise consumers who want to switch to a different account provider with an exit fee.Choice's pick of institutions so far - based on a benchmark that takes into account the interest rate, account keeping and exit fees, fair and simple interest rate calculations and minimum deposit requirement - are AMP Bank and the two teachers credit unions of NSW and Victoria.The federal Treasury estimates that around $6.5 billion will be held in first home saver accounts after four years with a take-up of 730,000 accounts.Ms Plibersek said the accounts will be open for those aged between 18 and 65, but family members can also contribute. 'One of the greatest hopes for Australian parents and grandparents is to see their children and grandchildren well settled in a home of their own,' she said.
