DOZENS of non-bank lenders have failed to pass on successive interest rate cuts to borrowers as politicians ignore their greedy tactics.While both sides of politics pressure the big banks to pass on official interest rate cuts, non-bank lenders are getting away with charging as much as 5 per cent more than the big four on a standard home loan, The Sunday Telegraph reports.Because the industry is unregulated, there is nothing stopping non-conforming lenders from ripping off home owners whose credit history or lack of documentation stops them getting a loan from a bank.Mortgage brokers are also earning huge commissions by signing up borrowers - even if they cannot afford the repayments.Non-conforming lenders, such as Liberty Finance, are slugging customers 13.65 per cent for a standard variable home loan, compared with the nation's biggest home loan lender, the Commonwealth Bank, with a standard variable rate of 8.53 per cent.One lender to buck the trend is Aussie Home Loans, which last night slashed its rates by 30 basis points.But other non-bank lenders admit they will hike rates further, despite the ANZ announcing on Friday it will cut its standard variable rate by 25 basis points. The other big banks are expected to follow suit this week.Non-conforming contracts include low-doc loans that do not require borrowers to provide proof of income and ability to service the mortgage.The Reserve Bank cut interest rates by a full percentage point this month, and further cuts are expected.But a Liberty Financial sales representative told The Sunday Telegraph: 'We offer non-conforming loans, so our pricing is different to banks.'Since the start of this credit crisis, our rates have increased, and they will definitely go up.'GE Money - with a standard variable rate of 12.89 per cent yesterday - said its rates were higher because it gave loans to riskier clients with little or no documentation.A GE spokesman confirmed the hike was also due to higher commissions paid to mortgage brokers.Brokers generally earn a 60 per cent higher commission on low-doc sales than on standard mortgages.On a $300,000 loan, a broker would receive a $2400 upfront commission on a low-doc sale, compared with $1500 for a standard mortgage.Low-doc loans worth more than $8 billion were written last financial year - up 26 per cent year-on-year.Last month, a Reserve Bank report found 8.5 per cent of households in Australia with non-conforming loans were at least 90 days behind in repayments, up from two per cent in 2004.Finance monitor Cannex found 16 non-conforming lenders were being serviced by brokers last month, six fewer than at the corresponding time last year.A spokesman for Treasurer Wayne Swan said: 'The Government and families expect all lenders to provide as much interest-rate relief as possible in the current circumstances.'
