Activity in Australia's services sector has declined for a sixth straight month, as turbulent financial markets and a weak housing market subdue the economy, a report shows. The Australian Industry (Ai) Group/Commonwealth Bank Performance of Services Index rose 5.6 points to 44.9 in September. It was the first easing in the pace of activity decline since May, after the index hit a record low - 39.3 points - in August. The number, based on a survey of 200 firms, has remained under the 50 level since April. 'The persistent spectre of global financial instability, as well as ongoing weakness in the Australian housing market, has ensured that individuals and companies remain cautious,' Ai Group chief executive Heather Ridout said. 'The turmoil in global financial markets in recent weeks has contributed to weakness in consumer and business confidence in Australia and across the globe.' Commonwealth Bank of Australia senior economist John Peters said the weak services sector illustrated a cooling economy, which was why the RBA cut interest rates. The central bank cut the overnight cash rate on September 2 by 25 basis points, from a 12-year high of 7.25 per cent. It was the RBA's first rate cut since December 2001. Markets are forecasting the central bank will cut rates again next Tuesday. 'Lower interest rates and lower petrol prices will help cushion the slowdown, as will the recently lower Australian dollar,' Mr Peters said. 'But a period of sluggish growth and some upward pressure on the unemployment rate looks to be well and truly in the economic frame.' Despite lower fuel costs and the September 2 cut, activity contracted in seven of the nine services sector during the month, Ms Ridout said. Only the sectors of personal and recreational services and transport and storage experienced an expansion in activity, seasonally adjusted, during the month. Activity fell in all states, with the rate of contraction accelerating only in Queensland.
