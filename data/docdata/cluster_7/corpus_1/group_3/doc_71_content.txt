Commonwealth Bank of Australia has agreed to buy British bank HBOS's Australian unit BankWest for A$2.1 billion ($1.5 billion), to boost its market share in fast-growing Western Australia, the bank said on Wednesday.CBA, Australia's second-largest bank, also said it had had exploratory talks with Suncorp-Metway, which on Monday revealed it had received approaches for its banking and wealth management businesses, but no sale process was underway.CBA said it would raise A$2 billion of Tier 1 capital in an institutional placement of securities to help fund the BankWest deal. 'BankWest provides a significant opportunity to further develop the Group's business in the fast growing Western Australian market,' Commonwealth chief executive, Ralph Norris said. 'The strength of our current capital and funding position combined with the strategic value of this transaction makes this an attractive opportunity for the Group and its shareholders,' Norris said. Like many other lenders around the world hit by the global credit crisis, British banks are scrambling to raise funds to shore up ailing balance sheets. HBOS has accepted a UK government-backed takeover bid from rival Lloyds TSB.Consolidation in Australia's banking sector has been widely expected as its big four players bulk up to weather the financial market turmoil.Westpac Banking, Australia's fourth-biggest bank, is close to acquiring the No. 5 bank St George, while Suncorp-Metway said on Monday it had received several approaches for its banking unit.CBA would also acquire HBOS's life insurance and wealth management business in Australia, St Andrews, but not its other Australian businesses, Capital Finance Australia Ltd, BOS International (Australia) Ltd and HBOS's Australian Treasury operations.In the same statement, CBA said it had marked down its holding of notes in troubled childcare operator ABC Learning Centres, which would detract A$100 million from its net profit in its fiscal 2009.It also reiterated that it its exposure to failed U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers could reduce 2009 net profit by about A$100 million.The BankWest purchase, which CBA said would be earnings per share accretive immediately, is conditional on the receipt of all necessary competition, regulatory and government approvals.
