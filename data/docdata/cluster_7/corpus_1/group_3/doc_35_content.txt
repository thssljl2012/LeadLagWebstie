Australia's banking sector could shed more than 10,000 jobs in the coming 12 months as banks look to rein in costs amid an expected slowdown in lending growth, an industry analyst said Friday. Andrew Dickinson, head of banking at KPMG in Australia, said he expects each of Australia's major banks could cut around 2,000 positions each, with trends towards offshoring and outsourcing likely to continue. Several of Australia's big banks have embarked on restructuring programs in recent months and all are tightening the reins on costs amid tumultuous conditions for banks globally. Among the moves, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) Chief Executive Mike Smith has started streaming the Melbourne-based bank's management structure, while Westpac said it has cut back-office staff in its BT wealth management arm. John Mulcahy, chief executive of banking and insurance group Suncorp-Metway Ltd, told reporters Friday that his group has had an effective hiring freeze on, meaning a reduction in staff numbers by attrition, but could not rule out redundancies. However, there is no timetable on any decisions around staffing numbers, he said. The pending merger of Westpac Banking Corp. (WBK) and St. George Bank Ltd, will add to the number of job cuts as the two look to boost synergies and cut overlaps, KPMG's Dickinson said. The equivalent of around 10% of St. George's current employee base could be cut from the merged group, he said.
