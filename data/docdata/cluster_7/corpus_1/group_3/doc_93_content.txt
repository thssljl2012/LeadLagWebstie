The UK banking sector may not be in profit for at least the next five years.The Bank of England's financial stability report warns that if mortgage arrears rise from 1.3 per cent to 4.4 per cent and corporate insolvencies rise from 0.6 per cent to 1.7 per cent, both-stress tested estimates, then, over the next five years, profits at best are only likely to match losses.Its stress-test calculates estimated losses of Barclays, HBOS, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, Nationwide, and RBS to be around 130bn over the next five years while estimated profits are only 80bn to 130bn. The report estimates worldwide losses of $2.8trillion as a result of the finan- cial crisis. It says UK losses have doubled from 62.7bn to 122.6bn over the last six months.Liberal Democrat deputy leader Vince Cable believes the Bank of England has underestimated the situation. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The Today Programme this week, he said: 'It has ignored the second rounds of bad losses that the banks could face with a seriously falling housing market. Research suggests that, on average, big financial crises wipe out 15 per cent of GDP - that is six to seven years of growth.'UBS senior economic adviser George Magnus says: 'The default rates of corporate debt have not even started to get to levels you would expect from a recession, which is in excess of 15 per cent to 20 per cent, so the total losses will be a lot bigger.'Savills director Melanie Bien says five years without profits could force banks to be more inventive.She says: 'Strategies of banks would change and they would have to come out with better products.'Premier Mortgage Services corporate manager Martin Reynolds says: 'Anything that makes lenders realign and look to attract more business would be good for mortgages.'
