The housing market is facing more bad news, with migration to New Zealand down to its lowest level in almost seven years and a continued flood of people to Australia.A net annual gain of just 4400 migrants was announced yesterday.This was almost half the level of a year ago and the lowest annual gain since October 2001.The Statistics New Zealand figures came out just before today's expected cut in the Reserve Bank official interest rate, which most economists expect to be lowered 1 per cent to 6.5 per cent.That would be the biggest rate cut yet, and would probably push mortgage rates down sharply and give some support to a weakening house market, despite the low migration figures.Reserve Bank governor Alan Bollard will make his announcement on interest rates at 9am.Usually Dr Bollard would simply issue a brief statement, because the announcement comes just six weeks after he last cut rates, by half a per cent.But yesterday the Reserve Bank said Dr Bollard would hold a press conference.Meanwhile, Statistics NZ said that in the year to September, 86,700 people arrived permanently, while 82,300 left. The resulting net gain of 4400 people was down from 8300 in the September 2007 year.Monthly arrivals were almost 10 per cent lower, while new departures fell almost 5 per cent.In September alone there was a net migration gain of just 10 people, compared with an average gain of more than 600 a month in the past six months.For the year, the net outflow to Australia was 33,900, compared with 26,200 in the September 2007 year.That was higher than previous peaks in the January 1989 year and the December 1979 year.ASB Bank economist Jane Turner said waning net migration was one of the main drivers of a weakening housing market.'Residential investment has already contracted 15 per cent and is expected to fall further in the next year.'The world credit crisis meant the present weakness in migration to New Zealand was likely to be short-lived because it would be harder for Kiwis to find work in Britain, ASB said.Kiwis overseas may also start heading home as they did in large numbers after the 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States.National Party finance spokesman Bill English said the Labour government had failed to deal with the causes of the wave of departures to Australia and other countries.The 82,000 leaving the country was the highest number for a year since 1979, and more than half of them went to Australia, he said.The exodus showed New Zealand needed to grow so New Zealanders could enjoy higher wages and a better quality of life at home.He also pointed to past tax cuts in Australia as an attraction.
