Efforts by governments and policy makers around the world to support financial markets have lowered the chances of global ruin, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) says.Measures taken by national governments to guarantee bank deposits have revived confidence, as central banks addressed capital and liquidity issues markets, RBA governor Glenn Stevens said on Tuesday.And while there was more work to be done on the detail of the plans, major policy makers understand the gravity of the economic climate, he said in a speech at a Trans-Tasman Business Circle lunch on 'Australia, New Zealand and the international economy'.Mr Stevens said the RBA had supported the steps taken by the Federal Government in announcing a general guarantee of deposits held in financial institutions, to allay any public anxiety about the security of savings.'Steps in these directions, in the context of what other countries were doing, were sensible and the RBA supported them,' he said.'As is also the case in other countries, the design features of the various guarantees will be important.'Mr Stevens the central bank was working with Treasury on the details of the Australian arrangements.'The RBA is working with our colleagues in the Treasury on the details of the Australian arrangements, including on how to maintain continued healthy functioning of Australia's short-term money markets,' he said.Mr Stevens said while it was hazardous to make predictions, it appeared the key elements of dealing with the root issues of the global financial crisis were starting to come into place.'Policy-makers in the major countries do 'get it',' he said.'The plans are not precisely uniform across countries - that is never achievable anyway - but we can, I think, see the shape of a broad common outline.'It addresses the issues of liquidity, capital and confidence.'There is much more work to be done on the yet on the design details, and one area in which further international co-operation would be helpful is in the area of making these various guarantee arrangements broadly consistent.'But the world, it seems to me, is getting on to a better path.''As a result, the likelihood of a global catastrophe has in fact declined over the past couple of weeks.'Mr Stevens observed that confidence in financial markets had been hammered over the past year, and particularly in the past six weeks.'Optimism seems also to have been a casualty of recent financial events abroad,' he said.'As outcomes have been rather unlike what the sophisticated modern set of institutions and markets were supposed to have delivered.'But Mr Stevens also said that in countries where monetary policy settings had been prudent, and where inflation prospects permitted, interest rates had been eased to support economic growth in the face of the crisis.In Australia, the RBA this month cut the cash rate by 100 basis points to six per cent.Mr Stevens said the bank had brought forward reductions that might ordinarily have taken place over several months.While consumer price inflation was likely to remain high in the immediate future, forces that will dampen pressures on prices in 2009 now appear to be building.Mr Stevens said Australia won't see evidence for that for another six months or so.Mr Stevens said the federal government's $10.4 fiscal billion stimulus package announced last week would flow through the Australian economy during the summer while the recent depreciation of the Australian dollar would also support the economy as global growth slows, as expected.'These changes will act to lessen the extent of the likely slowdown in Australia's economy, even as global forces work the other way,' he said.Looking ahead, Mr Stevens said while growth in China was slowing the country's emergence was continuing.China said on Monday gross domestic product for the first three quarters of this year had grown by 9.9 per cent after increasing 11.9 per cent in 2007.'Right now, China's economy is slowing,' Mr Stevens said.'This is a reminder that China's economy has cycles, like economies everywhere.'But even if it slows a lot, it will pick up again in due course and will probably grow pretty strongly, on average, over many years.'Mr Stevens also expects Australian households to start lowering their debt levels, or at least pare back debt growth.'Household credit growth will not be as fast as it was for the past decade and a half,' he said.'Perhaps we will need also to get better at turning borrowing for housing into more dwellings rather than just higher house prices.'
