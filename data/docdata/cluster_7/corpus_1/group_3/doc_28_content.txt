Australian consumer confidence plunged in October as global financial market turmoil stirred worries about the economy, a survey shows.The latest consumer sentiment index has fallen to its second weakest level since early 1992, in the aftermath of the last recession.Economists say the dire reading vindicates the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) surprise decision on Tuesday to cut interest rates by one percentage point for the first time in 16 years.The Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index dived by 11 per cent to 82 points in October, an unusually large fall comparable with the 1987 stock market crash and the tech wreck of early 2001.The latest measure is just three index points above July's 16-year low reading, and reverses September's seven per cent improvement.The survey of 1,200 people was taken in the days before the RBA slashed the cash rate to a two-year low of six per cent, a move which surprised economists who were expecting a smaller half a percentage point cut.Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said the sharp drop in consumer sentiment showed the RBA needed to act to restore confidence.'As indicated by the double-digit fall in the index a strong, positive message was required from the Reserve Bank,' Mr Evans said.Consumer confidence fell 15.7 per cent in November 1987, following the stock market crash, and by 13.2 per cent in March 2001 after the tech wreck.Mr Evans said RBA would most likely cut rates by 50 basis points in November, as part of a 100 basis point rate easing in the next three to six months to ease credit conditions.JPMorgan economist Helen Kevans said widespread expectations of a rate cut failed to stem October's fall in consumer sentiment, as people doubted whether the banks would match an RBA rate easing.'While there was widespread speculation prior to the consumer sentiment survey that the RBA would cut the cash rate by as much as 50 basis points at its October meeting, at the same time there was an equal amount of speculation that domestic commercial banks would not pass on in full the cut to the official rate,' she said, adding the RBA's latest rate cut would boost consumer sentiment in late 2008.During the September 30 to October 5 survey period, the US share market's Standard and Poor's 500 index posted its biggest-ever points drop, while a string of European governments in Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands and the UK bailed out failing banks.The poll was taken just before the Australian dollar dived below 70 US cents for the first time in four years.Consumers surveyed were gloomy, with the measure asking people about economic conditions in the next year falling by 20.2 per cent.Since October 2007, this reading has declined by 45 per cent.Respondents were also less keen on spending, with the measure asking people about buying a major household item falling by 19.7 per cent in October.
