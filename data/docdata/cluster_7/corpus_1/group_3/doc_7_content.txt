(RTTNews) - Home sales in Australia declined for a third straight month in September, according to a report published Friday by the Housing Industry Association.The Association said sales of new homes decreased 1.8 percent, following a drop of 1.3 percent in August.The decrease came despite September's 25 basis point cut in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of Australia, the first rate reduction in seven years. Sales of stand-alone houses fell 2.3 percent in September, the eighth consecutive month of declines for detached house sales, with the HIA report saying the short-term outlook for detached house construction is not very bright. 'Lower interest rates and a stimulus to first-home buyers should, however, lead to a gradual recovery emerging over the first half of 2009,' the reports said.
