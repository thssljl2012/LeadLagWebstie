leading a broad-based sell-off in British banks, as the UK government prepared to announce a rescue package for its crippled financial sector.''It's certainly an attractive price, indicating some distress and willingness to sell. CBA's definitely got an attractive deal,'' said Mark Nathan, a portfolio manager at Fortis Investment Partners.CBA, Australia's second-largest bank, also said it had had exploratory talks with Suncorp-Metway, which operates the country's sixth-biggest bank, but added that it was not currently involved in a sales process.''It does set an indicative benchmark price for what Suncorp's worth,'' said Nathan.CBA's purchase of BankWest, at 20% below book value, looks cheap compared to Westpac's takeover of St George Bank at 2.7 times book value.''The Commonwealth Bank regularly reviews acquisition opportunities but rarely have we seen a quality asset such as BankWest become available on such attractive terms to us,'' Ralph Norris, Commonwealth's chief executive said.Like many other lenders around the world hit by the global credit crisis, British banks are scrambling to raise funds to shore up ailing balance sheets. HBOS has accepted a British government-backed takeover bid from rival Lloyds TSB Group.Suncorp on Monday revealed it had received approaches for its banking and wealth management businesses. CBA has been tipped as a front runner to buy the assets. Analysts believe CBA could afford both.''We think so. They're raising funds for this, so they still maintain a very strong Tier 1 ratio and capital position. They remain well placed to consider a Suncorp opportunity,'' Macquarie analyst Ben Zucker said.The acquisition of BankWest would boost CBA's earnings per share immediately, and create annual pre-tax cost synergies estimated to be at 20-25% of BankWest's cost base, CBA said.The deal, expected to be completed end January 2009, did not require HBOS or CBA shareholder approval, but would depend on regulatory approvals.''We can't preempt the outcome, but expect any issues that would emerge can be overcome,'' a CBA spokesman said.
