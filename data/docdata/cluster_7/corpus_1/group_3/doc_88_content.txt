Activity in Australia's service sector contracted for a sixth straight month in September, though falls in petrol prices and interest rates helped slow the pace of decline, a survey showed.The Australian Industry (AiG) Group-Commonwealth Bank Performance of Services Index (PSI) rose 5.6 points to 44.9 in September, thanks in large part to an improvement in the transport sector. However, it remained below the 50 line marking the threshold between expansion and contraction.Of the nine sectors covered, only transport and recreational services showed any growth in the month. A drop in petrol prices and a cut in interest rates from the Reserve Bank of Australia was countered by turmoil in financial markets and weakness in the home building sector.CBA senior economist, John Peters, said the ongoing weakness in services was one reason the RBA cut rates in September, and added to the case for another easing this month.''The broadly-based weakness now evident in the services sector is weighing on the economy more generally,'' he said.''A period of sluggish growth and some upward pressure on the unemployment rate looks to be well and truly in the economic frame.''Investors have fully priced in a cut of at least 25 basis points in the 7.0% cash rate at the RBA's policy meeting next week, with a real chance it could ease by 50 basis points. Still, the survey did show some improvement from the record lows hit in August. The measure of new orders rose by 6.1 points to 44.5, while the index of sales rose 6.3 points to 42.2.Employment continued to contract though at a slower pace as that index rose 2.6 points to 47.0.Input costs eased a little but the index remained high at 71.0, while selling prices dipped 0.7 points to 52.5, pointing to continued pressure on profit margins.Reuters
