Nickel miner Mirabela Nickel Ltd's attempts to complete the syndication of $US280 million in senior debt has been delayed by two months due to market uncertainty.Mirabela had hoped to complete the syndication of the $US280 million debt, underwritten by Credit Suisse and Barclays, by early December 2008. 'Due to the uncertain credit markets, this syndication process is now delayed by approximately two months,' Mirabela said in a statement.But the miner said there was 'strong interest in the syndication'. 'Credit is available for quality projects at the right price.' Mirabela, whose activities are focussed on Brazil, said it had received feedback from preliminary debt marketing indicating that its Santa Rita project was 'considered a particularly high quality Project, capable of attracting finance even in a difficult market'. Mirabela said that market feedback suggested the syndication was best delayed 'by two months to allow credit and commodity markets to stabilise'. 'Also, some banks have a preference for new credits to be approved in the new year,' the miner said. Mirabela said it had taken action to help ensure that the syndication is successful.The capital cost of Santa Rita had been reduced by $US40 million, including reduced spending on exploration work and on the proposed port upgrade, and support facilities and services which were not essential to beginning production. 'As a result, the senior debt requirement is reduced to $US240 million, of which $US80 million is already drawn under the bridge facility provided by Credit Suisse and Barclays,' Mirabela said.
