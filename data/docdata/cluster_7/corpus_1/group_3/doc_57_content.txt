HOMEBUYERS across Australia will be able to take advantage of the Federal Government's first home saver accounts from today.The scheme, which passed parliament in June, is a key component of the government's $2.2 billion affordable housing package.From today, the accounts will be offered by major financial institutions across the country, including ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, AMP, Members Equity and several credit unions.Housing Minister Tanya Plibersek today officially launched the scheme at a western Sydney credit union.Treasurer Wayne Swan said the accounts brought the dream of home ownership closer to reality for many Australians. 'We promised to take action on housing affordability, so it's great to see these first home saver accounts will provide real help to thousands of young Australians trying to buy their first home,'' he said.People saving for their first home will need to put $5000 into their account each year to qualify for the full $850 government top-up.
