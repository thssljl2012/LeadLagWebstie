'The recent cuts in interest rates have provided some much-needed relief for business, however business costs are still rising and volatility in financial markets is providing concern,' Mr Vaughan said.Respondents to the survey said general business conditions dipped further than anticipated in the September quarter.Interest rates, petrol prices and the cost of doing business were still a challenge, the survey showed. Commonwealth Bank corporate financial services general manager South Australia and Northern Territory Joe Formichella said the results showed the resilience of SAbusinesses.'The upturn in confidence in the September quarter shows that many SA businesses are adapting well to the challenging economic climate,' he said.'This is also indicative of prudent management and strategic forward planning.'Mr Vaughan said the fall in general business conditions highlighted that the state was not insulated from worldwide economic troubles. He said while global markets remained volatile, continued vigilance was required to ensure SA businesses remained strong.Mr Vaughan said respondents indicated they were concerned about labour shortages and the increase in costs.
