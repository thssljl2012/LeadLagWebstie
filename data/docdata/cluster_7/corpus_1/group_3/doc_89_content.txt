Ms Bishop today urged the banks to pass on the full interest rate cut and not retain part of it to boost their profits. The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to hand down an interest rate cut of half a percentage point tomorrow, but the banks have indicated they will not be able to pass on the cut because of costs. Ms Bishop said failure to do so could jeopardise people's jobs. 'One of the most important ways to keep our financial sector strong is to ensure that Australians keep their jobs so that they can pay off their mortgages ... their bank loans,' Ms Bishop told reporters in Perth. 'And that is why if there is an interest rate cut tomorrow it should be passed on in full so that people can keep their jobs and keep paying off their financial obligations. 'Elsewhere around the world we are seeing unemployment rising ... it's over six per cent in the US ... it's over 7.5 per cent across Europe, about eight per cent in France and about 11 per cent in Spain.' Ms Bishop said the government's decision to spend money on national infrastructure was a long-term solution and would not help household budgets in the short term. She said Treasurer Wayne Swan should stop protecting the big banks. 'You've got the treasurer acting as the chief executive officer of one of the big banks and doing all the talking,' she said. 'Let's hear from the banks as to why they believe they cannot pass on in full an interest rate cut.'
