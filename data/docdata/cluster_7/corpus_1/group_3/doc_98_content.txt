AUSTRALIA'S Big Four bank chiefs have refused to commit to freeze their senior executives' bonuses, but say their pay is likely to suffer anyway.The British Government moved last week to cap the pay and bonuses of British banking executives, but Westpac, ANZ, National Australia Bank and Commonwealth Bank have so far refused to make similar commitments. The four bank chiefs last year earned a total of more than $20 million in salaries and bonuses. A spokeswoman for ANZ chief Mike Smith - who last year received a $9 million sign-on bonus - said her boss's pay would drop, as it is linked to the bank's plunging share price. The pays of the other three chiefs - Westpac's Gail Kelly, NAB's Ahmed Fahour, and CBA's Ralph Norris - are also understood to be linked to their tanking share prices. A spokesman for Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan said executive pay was a matter for the banks.
