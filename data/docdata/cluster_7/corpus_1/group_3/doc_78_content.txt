Business conditions plunged in the September quarter, falling to mid-2001 levels as the economy continued to cool.The index of business conditions dropped 11 points to -4 index points in the three months to September, one of the biggest quarterly falls in the past two decades, according to the National Australia Bank's quarterly business survey.The weakness filtering through the economy has also begun to show in a fraying demand for workers. 'The proportion of firms reporting the availability of labour as a constraint on current output has fallen from a recent record of 72% in early 2008 to 66% in the September quarter,' said NAB group chief economist Alan Oster in a statement. 'While the proportion of employers nominating labour shortages as the main constraint on their 12 month profit outlook has fallen from a recent record of 33% to 13% in the latest survey.' Slumping consumer demand and slower lending activity pushed down all of the components of the gauge to levels seen in 2001, when business conditions stood at -11 index points, NAB said.Trading conditions contracted 11 points to -4 points, profits have also lost 10 index points to rank -8, and employment - which was flat in the June quarter - edged down 3 points to -3 points.Business confidence, a forward looking indicator, increased 1 index point to -7 index points for the December quarter, below their mid-2000 levels. 'Businesses expect conditions to slow significantly further in the December quarter of 2008,' Mr Oster said. 'Confidence in their own industry has stabilised, albeit at low (negative) levels which continue to remain lower than mid-2000.' Economists have been forced to revise downward their expectations for global growth amid the disruptions to the global economy triggered by the credit and banking crisis, which has sucked up money, devalued assets and pushed companies to the brink of collapse.The bank said major economies would slow further 'due to lags associated with negative wealth effects from lower equity and house prices'. 'Recessions are forecast for the US, Europe, Japan and UK, while growth moderates in developing economies,' the bank said in a statement.czappone@fairfax.com.auBusinessDay
