 DANNY JOHNFURTHER across-the-board cuts in lending rates are expected as the major banks switch their focus from the hard-pressed housing market to the wider business sector in an effort to avoid the credit crunch-hit economy slipping into recession.National Australia Bank yesterday became the second of the Big Four banks to announce another 0.2 of a percentage-point drop in its interest rates, following the move by its rival ANZ on Friday.ANZ cut its rates by 0.25 percentage points, taking the total of its most recent reductions to slightly more than the surprise economy-boosting percentage- point fall announced by the Reserve Bank two weeks ago.In a move that reflects growing concern among political, economic and business leaders, NAB said its lower interest rate will apply not only to its mortgages but also to loans to businesses and the farming industry - two of the sectors that the bank counts as major customers.For hard-pressed home owners, the mortgage rate will drop to 8.36 per cent from next Monday in a move that will take the savings on the repayments on an average $250,000 loan to more than $200 a month since the RBA's reduction.Ahmed Fahour, the chief executive of NAB's Australian division, underlined the need to extend the impact of the lower rates to the wider community to avert the present slowdown worsening.'We will do everything we can, while still acting responsibly, to help our customers get through these current challenges,' he said yesterday.The decisions by NAB and ANZ will put increasing pressure on the other two big banks, Commonwealth and Westpac, which are expected to push through matching reductions in the next few days.
