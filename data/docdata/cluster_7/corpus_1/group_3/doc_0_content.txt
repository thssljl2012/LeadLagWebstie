A major interest rate cut in Australia is expected to boost that country's real estate industry and is putting pressure on New Zealand's Reserve Bank to be just as generous.The Reserve Bank of Australia has slashed the official cash rate by a full percentage point and Australia's five major banks have passed on 80 percent of the rate. For borrowers with a $300,000 mortgage, it translates to a saving of $164 a month.Phil Naylor from Australia's Mortgage and Finance Association says it is good news for Australians wanting to get into the housing market. 'It was a massive surprise but a very great welcome as well. This will be a great kick-start for mortgage industries. People who have been hovering on the sidelines for some time will come back into the market.' Analysts say the move will put pressure on New Zealand's Reserve Bank to follow suit when it makes its next official cash rate announcement on October 23. ANZ National Bank chief economist has told the Herald that he believes the RBNZ will cut the rate by a percentage point to 6.5 percent by the end of the month and possibly before the next scheduled review.Australia's rate cut from seven to six percent, is the biggest the RBA has made since 1992. It was double the amount analysts had been expecting.America's Federal Reserve is also mulling with the idea of cutting rates. US Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke says he must consider whether the current interest rate policy remains appropriate.
