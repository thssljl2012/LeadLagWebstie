St George Bank Ltd has increased annual cash profit by 13.9 per cent, in contrast to two of its bigger rivals, as it prepares to join Australia's third biggest bank Westpac Banking Corp.Cash profit, St George's preferred performance measure, jumped to a record $1.32 billion in fiscal 2008, from $1.16 billion the year before. Net profit gained 0.9 per cent to $1.17 billion.Last week, National Australia Bank Ltd, the country's third biggest, reported a cash profit fall of 10.7 per cent while ANZ Banking Group Ltd's figure slumped 23 per cent.St George chief executive Paul Fegan said his bank had increased profit by focusing on growing the traditional banking products of deposits and loans while avoiding investing in hedge funds and complex asset backed securities, that have caused banking losses around the world.'The credit quality of the bank was the underpinning quality,' Mr Fegan told AAP.'I'm not embarrassed to say this goes to the fundamentals of banking - you gather deposits, rent it out and expect to get it back.'We don't play in the institutional space and sometimes people say its boring, but through the cycle, it makes a lot of difference.'St George announced a final dividend of 94 cents and would make a special payment as part of the takeover deal of 31 cents, for a second half total of $1.25. The entire payout for the year ended September 30 is $2.44, up from $1.68.The bank's total income grew 9.4 per cent to $3.58 billion in fiscal 2008, while its ratio of expenses to income declined to 38.7 per cent, from 42.5 per cent, as St George limited cost increases.'The result was broadly in line with market expectations and guidance,' said Morgan Stanley analyst Richard Wiles, who has an 'evenweight' rating on St George.'They've definitely been disciplined in controlling their costs.'Mr Wiles said the bank used one-off gains in revenue - profit on the sale of Visa shares and payments from AIG for insurance arrangements - to fund an 29.7 per cent increase in provisions and loan impairment reserves to $620 million, which was prudent given the slowdown in the global economy.Shares in St George fell 52 cents, or 1.94 per cent, to close at $26.30, after rising as high as $28.39.Westpac, which has agreed to buy St George in a scrip deal worth $15 billion, declined 24 cents to $20.26.Westpac's offer, announced in May, was again recommended by the St George board, after gained approval from Treasurer Wayne Swan last week. Westpac is offering 1.31 of its own shares for each St George share, valuing St George shares at $26.54 each.The combined company will be Australia's second largest bank by market value, worth about $53.4 billion, after Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd's $56.2 billion.Only mining giant BHP Billiton will have a bigger market value in Australia, at $88.3 billion.Westpac will retain a distinct St George brand and Mr Fegan said the bigger bank can learn customer service from its takeover target.'They're buying a world class franchise with a business mix that's very clear and brands that are very tangible which customers respect ... a high level of customer satisfaction and low level of attrition,' Mr Fegan said.'These things can be transferred into the new entity and help Westpac with the transformation of itself.'Morgan Stanley's Mr Wiles agreed, pointing out that Westpac chief executive Gail Kelly, the former head of St George, had indicated that she wanted to improve her bank's customer focus.'St George has a reputation of being customer friendly,' he said.St George's retail bank satisfaction score of 75.5 per cent compares with the average for the major banks of 69.9 per cent.Risks to the merger for Westpac, other than those related to integration, include the need to improve St George's capital position and manage its credit quality, just because St George had grown so fast over recent years, Mr Wiles said.St George's Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio is 6.6 per cent, above the required minimum of 6.25 per cent.Westpac will reporting its full-year profit on Thursday. The average forecast of analysts, according to Reuters data, is for cash profit to grow 6.1 per cent to $3.72 billion.
