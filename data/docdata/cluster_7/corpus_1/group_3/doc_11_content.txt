Clive Peeters Ltd says it expects to post a loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 as weakened consumer confidence translates into subdued trading for the electrical goods retailer.The company said conditions would remain challenging for the remainder of 2008/09 but the government's recent economic stimulus package and interest rate cuts had improved prospects for the Christmas trading period.The company said today it expected a net operating loss of around $1 million for the three months to September 30.Clive Peeters said the financial year started well, with delivered sales being over budget in July but that sales for August and September were below budget by six per cent and 12 per cent respectively.Like-for-like sales for August fell 10 per cent, and overall sales for September dropped 14 per cent compared with the period in 2007.'Weaker floor traffic accounted for the sales decline, with sharp falls across all states in August and September 2008,' the company said.The retailer derives around 60 per cent of its earnings from whitegoods and said there was a climate of fear and uncertainty among consumers.'The main contributor appears to be the significant impact on consumer confidence due to the unprecedented events affecting the global and Australian financial sectors, and availability of credit, and emerging concerns about job security ...'It said these worries added to concerns about interest rates, fuel costs and the cost of living.Clive Peeters said consumer sentiment was expected to improve because of government stimulatory initiatives, such as the First Home Buyers grant, and interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia.'These initiatives have not yet translated to any significant sales uplift for the company into October because, in the main, the relief has not yet found its way to consumers,' the company said in a statement.'The board believes that the overall outlook for retail has improved as a result, giving better prospects for an improved Christmas trading period, and beyond.'Notwithstanding the improving sentiment the board believes that retail conditions for at least the remainder of fiscal 2009 will remain very challenging.'-AAPBuilding a new shop?
