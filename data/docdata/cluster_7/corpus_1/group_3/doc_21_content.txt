(Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX: Quote, Profile, Research), the country's No. 2 lender by assets, has offered as much as A$3 billion ($2.4 billion) to troubled British bank HBOS (HBOS.L: Quote, Profile, Research) for its Australian operation BankWest, the Australian Financial Review reported on Thursday.A Commonwealth Bank spokesman said the bank would not comment on the speculation.Without citing sources, the paper said the offer was below the level HBOS, which is the subject of a UK government-backed takeover offer from fellow British bank Lloyds TSB LLOYD.L, was willing to sell for.Media reports in August had said CBA may offer over A$6 billion for BankWest, but valuations since then have been hammered by a string of high profile bank collapses caused by the credit crisis.The Lloyds-HBOS tie-up was announced last month after a slump in HBOS' share price stirred fears the bank might fall victim to the credit crunch. HBOS is Britain's biggest mortgage lender.Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ.AX: Quote, Profile, Research) and National Australia Bank (NAB.AX: Quote, Profile, Research) are also interested in BankWest but have not been as aggressive as CBA, the paper said.In the same report, the Financial Review also said that Australian insurer Suncorp-Metway Ltd (SUN.AX: Quote, Profile, Research) had received a number of informal approaches from larger rivals, including CBA and ANZ.ANZ, Australia's third-largest lender, said it did not wish to comment on the BankWest or Suncorp-Metway reports, and Suncorp had no comment on the speculation.Suncorp in August posted a near halving in year profit for fiscal 2008, hit be the turbulence on global markets, and has seen its shares drop 43 percent so far this year.
