SYDNEY, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) injected some extra cash into the money market on Wednesday as banks' reluctance to lend to one another kept money market rates stubbornly high.The RBA sought to ease some of the strain by adding A$4.669 billion ($3.71 billion) in repurchase agreements, slightly above an estimated daily need of A$4.632 billion.The addition should keep banks' cash cushion with the RBA around a record A$11 billion.Like many central banks, the RBA has been generous with liquidity in recent weeks as turmoil in world markets led commercial banks to keep hold of cash.(Reporting by Anirban Nag) . ng
