Colonial First State, the wealth management arm of Commonwealth Bank, has become the latest and biggest fund manager to block investors withdrawing money following the government's guarantee of bank deposits.Colonial has frozen daily withdrawals from $3.3 billion worth of funds that have significant investments in mortgages.It brings the total amount of money locked up within investment funds to more than $24 billion.CBA shares slumped on the news, falling $1.83, or 4.5%, to $39.01 and dragging down the general market.Colonial's move comes as industry representatives meet with Treasury officials in Canberra today to discuss ways of halting the financial drift away from funds uncovered by the government guarantee, to banks enjoying explicit support. 'The sudden actions of other fund managers have had a roll on effect on Colonial First State's mortgage funds, causing an increased level of redemptions in the last few days,'' Colonial said today. 'This decision will enable Colonial First State to take a measured approach to processing withdrawals in an orderly fashion.Colonial has also suspended applications, daily withdrawals and switches from one fund to another. The affected funds will continue to make pension payments and pay distributions to investors. Investors will have an opportunity to withdraw funds every three months, depending on the available proceeds of the fund.The funds affected are the Colonial First State Wholesale Income Fund, FirstChoice Wholesale Income option, FirstChoice Income option, Managed Investment Funds - Mortgage Income Fund, Bricks and Mortar Fund, Guaranteed Mortgage Fund and the Rollover and Superannuation Fund -Mortgage option.Colonial's decision comes after other blue-chip fund managers Perpetual, AXA, and Australian Unity put blocks on funds last week.The funds sector estimates up to $12 billion of funds have been frozen to stem a flight of cash to government guaranteed financial institutions.But Morningstar, a financial ratings agency, said before Colonial's move that about $21 billion had been frozen in mortgage and other investment funds.Sydney Morning Herald
