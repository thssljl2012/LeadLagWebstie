MELBOURNE, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Australia needs to examine its policy of blocking the top four banks from merging so that they don't fall behind rapidly consolidating U.S. and UK rivals, a executive of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group said on Thursday. Brian Hartzer, the head of ANZ's Australian operations, said one implication of the recent wave of mergers among U.S. and UK banks could be that Australian banks would start to look 'pretty small'. 'If we want to have the strength of balance sheet to be able to take advantage of opportunities, both domestically and offshore ... if we want to be able to compete with the firepower of the world banks, when this situation settles down, we need to take a look at the restriction of the structure of the industry,' Hartzer said. The Australian government recently renewed an 18-year-old policy, called the 'four pillars', banning the big four banks from merging with each other, to preserve competition. But there have been calls for an end to the policy, which critics in the industry and outside say stunts the growth of Australia's top four banks: ANZ, National Australia Bank (nyse: NAB - news - people ) , Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp. (nyse: WBK - news - people ) ANZ, the No.3 bank, has for now concentrated on expanding in Asia, and Hartzer said opportunities in the region remained plentiful and would not be much affected by the current global credit turmoil. 'The relative amount of investment we need to make certainly is not so dramatic to be hugely affected by what is going on. We have to be a bit more cautious from an inorganic perspective, but from an organic perspective there is still plenty of opportunity, and we are going after it,' Hartzer said.  . ng   Thomson Financial News Limited 2008.
