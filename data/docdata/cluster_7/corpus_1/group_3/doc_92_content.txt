 The service sector shrank for a sixth consecutive month in September according to the AiG Performance of Service Index. The metric printed at 44.9, a slight improvement over last month's reading at 39.3, a 5-year low. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates by 25 basis points in September, allowing for the uptick. That said, the economy continues to face substantial headwinds both domestically and abroad, keeping the reading below the key 50 'boom-bust' level. Looking at trading in index swaps, the market is pricing in 150 basis points in additional monetary easing from the RBA over the next 12 months.
