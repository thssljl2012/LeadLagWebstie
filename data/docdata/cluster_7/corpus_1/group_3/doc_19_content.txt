First-home buyers are having to put up more cash for a mortgage as banks toughen up on lending.Just as interest rates are falling, mortgage add-on fees have risen, and banks want 20 per cent deposits and higher incomes before approving loans.Based on the latest prices, this would mean a $45,000 deposit on an average home in Christchurch's cheaper suburbs, such as Linwood, Aranui or Bexley.Christchurch financial consultant Mike Columbus, of New Zealand Home Loans, said: 'Most new-home buyers are not in the market now because all of a sudden they need a bigger deposit. Twenty per cent is standard.'That's dropped a lot of buyers out of the market. Interest rates have dropped, but I think not many people are in a position take advantage of it. So that's a huge shift, and it's only just happened.'Mortgage broker John Archer, of Roost in Christchurch, agreed. 'It's certainly more difficult to get a loan these days.'He said banks would sometimes lend more than 80% of a home's value, but they demanded a registered valuation, lender's mortgage insurance, an application fee and a low-equity fee of about 1% of the property's value. There were also the usual legal fees.'Three months ago, no problem; they didn't want a valuation and most would be happy to waive most of those sorts of charges,' he said. 'Now they have really tightened up.'The extra charges would add thousands of dollars to a loan, putting many would-be buyers out of the market.Archer said he had seen buyers forced to cancel contracts on homes after missing out on loans they had been confident of getting.The past few months have also seen lenders become stricter as homes have lost value, while the credit crunch and a run on funds triggered a world banking crisis.Risk-averse lenders are also coming down harder on income criteria, requiring hundreds of dollars more in monthly pay packets.Columbus and Archer said that in many cases parents were having to help their adult offspring to boost the deposit or by co-signing a loan.ASB Bank head of retail banking Ian Park said it was now hard to get a mortgage with a low deposit, especially without a high income, and he advised first-home buyers to save 15% or 20% of a house's value.He said the bank had increased the income required to approve a loan to allow for rising living costs and any future interest rate rises.Redcliffs couple Sam Bridgman and Chandra Littlewood were after a first home last year but are now trying to save a bigger deposit.With one-year-old son Arlo to care for, they are down to a single income and wary of being overstretched when they buy.'There were some good places out there a year ago, but they were expensive,' Bridgman said. 'But you didn't need much deposit, so that wasn't a hindrance. We could've got a 90% loan and there weren't any of those extras. 'You don't normally budget for that when you are buying a house.'He said the couple were 'keeping a watching eye' on the market now, and were still keen to buy when they could.'We want to feel the money we are paying is going towards something of our own rather than something else. We're not big drinkers and we're putting aside a little bit every week, but it takes longer than you think on one income,' he said.
