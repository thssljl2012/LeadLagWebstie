Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board member Roger Corbett says the country is likely to see another quarter of negative economic growth. 'I think we're likely to see a further quarter of negative growth,' Mr Corbett told journalists after an American Chamber of Commerce in Australia lunch in Sydney. Mr Corbett's remark on Thursday comes after RBA deputy governor Ric Battellino earlier this week said 'GDP is likely to fall in 2009'. The RBA board meets on April 7 to discuss monetary policy.  Financial markets are divided over whether the central bank will leave the cash interest rate on hold, or reduce it. The cash rate currently stands at 3.25 per cent. The RBA's most recent published forecasts in February projected the economy to grow by an annualised 0.5 per cent in 2009.  The most recent reading for gross domestic product showed the economy contracted by 0.5 per cent in the December quarter of 2008 - the first quarterly contraction in eight years.  Another quarter of negative growth would see the economy formally enter a recession. The March quarter growth figures will be released in June.  Mr Corbett, who is a former chief executive of Woolworths Ltd, also said monthly retail sales figures released on Wednesday weren't as bad as some thought.  He said the sales figures for February would still be the 'envy' of other countries in the OECD.  Retail trade at current prices fell 2.0 per cent in February to a seasonally adjusted $18.873 billion, the ABS said on Wednesday.
