The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment rose by 7.5 per cent in December to 92.0 index points, from 85.5 points in November.  Most of the 1,200 consumers polled were surveyed after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut the cash rate by 100 basis points on December 2 to 4.25 per cent.  Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said the lift in consumer sentiment in December was not a given after a 'disappointing rise' of only 4.3 per cent the month before. 'Despite the announcement of a further one per cut in the Reserve Bank's cash rate, an 18.4 per cent fall in petrol prices and a share market rally in recent weeks, it was not obvious that the consumer sentiment index would have shown such a significant jump,' he said on Tuesday. 'The gloom surrounding the global economy and the associated threat to Australia could have easily overwhelmed all the positives. 'The index is now up 12.1 per cent over the last two months, 16.4 per cent from its low point for 2008 and 3.3 per cent above the average reading for 2008.' Mortgage holders are becoming more confident after the recent slashing of the overnight cash rate by the RBA, Mr Evans said.  Since September, the central bank has cut the cash rate by 300 basis, to a six-and-a-half year low of 4.25 per cent, as it tries to head of weakness in the domestic economy. 'With the banks now having passed on around 2.7 per cent of the three per cent in rate cuts over the last three months, households are responding,' Mr Evans said. 'The confidence of mortgage holders surged by 11 per cent in December compared to 1.6 per cent for tenants.' Mr Evans said four of the five components in the index rose in December, with those surveyed less optimistic about the economic outlook in five years. 'Last month opinions on 'family finances compared to a year ago' fell by 7.8 per cent but saw an increase of 4.6 per cent in December,' he said. 'Expectations for finances over the next twelve months improved by 5.3 per cent. 'The one year outlook for economic conditions improved by 5.7 per cent.' A 28.2 per cent jump into whether now was a good time to buy a major household item, following a 15.8 rise in November, was good news for retailers, Mr Evans said. 'It is sending a welcome message to beleaguered retailers as they move into the critical last few weeks before Christmas,' he said. 'Some restoration of confidence towards spending is the clear objective of the government's bold fiscal stimulus package.' On the housing front there was a lift in the 'Time to buy a dwelling index', up 39.4 per cent from its September reading, Mr Evans said. 'It is at the highest level since March 2002 when the housing boom was well established in Australia,' he said. Mr Evans expects the RBA to cut interest rates by 0.5 per cent when it next meets on February 3, and forecasts further rate cuts to boost the economy. 'In fact, we assess that with US rates likely to reach zero and European rates one per cent, there is ample scope for Australia to cut rates to below three per cent,' he said.
