The jobless rate has risen to the highest level in a year and economists are expecting unemployment to rise in 2009 as the Australian economy slows.  The national unemployment rate was a seasonally adjusted 4.4 per cent in November, the highest rate since November 2007, Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows.  The jobless rate jumped by 0.1 percentage points from October's 4.3 per cent level, as total employment fell by 15,600 to 10.75 million.  Economists had expected an unemployment rate of 4.5 per cent for November, with 15,000 job losses.  HSBC chief economist John Edwards said Australia's unemployment was likely to rise to six per cent in late 2009 as the local economy slowed - but not to the point of recession.'We would expect to see an unemployment rate of six per cent by the end of next year but I think we'll avoid recession,' Dr Edwards said.'To still be at 4.4 per cent in November 2008 is pretty good.'Full-time employment rose by 8,800 to 7.695 million, reversing two months of declines.  Dr Edwards said the rise in full-time employment in November showed the Australian labour market had weathered the economic slowdown in the second half of 2008.'This is still a relatively strong outcome but I think we'll see a weaker number next year,' he said.Meanwhile, part-time employment fell 24,400 to 3.055 million.  The participation rate in November was 65.1 per cent, compared with 65.2 per cent in October, with the latest result lower than market forecasts of 65.2 per cent.  JPMorgan chief economist Stephen Walters said Australia's jobless rate was on track to hit nine per cent by the end of 2010, as the mining sector led the way with job cuts.'Our call for a nine per cent jobless rate within two years is supported by the avalanche of job losses announced recently, including many in the mining sector, which led the charge during the long employment boom,' he said.'Also, the leading indicators of employment, including this week's ANZ job advertisement series and the employment component of the NAB business survey, have collapsed.'Mining giant Rio Tinto announced on Wednesday it would axing 14,000 staff worldwide while the ANZ banking group has confirmed it would retrench 400 jobs by the end of 2008.  Mr Walters said the rise in Australia's jobless rate in the next two years would be less severe than the early 1990s recession.  But he said the unemployment rate would still be high as struggling older workers stayed in the labour market.'We suspect, though, that labour force participation will be slower to decline this time around, which will inflate the unemployment rate,' Mr Walters said.'This is because of high skilled migration flows, older workers staying in the workforce longer to compensate for the fact that their retirement nest-egg has dwindled, and second income earners from many households seeking work to make fraying financial ends meet.'RBC Capital Markets senior economist Su-Lin Ong said the data showed Australia's labour force was shrinking at a more subdued pace.'There were no great surprises in today's survey which confirmed a labour market which looks to be deteriorating at a modest pace for now,' she said.'More importantly, the leading indicators hint at a much weaker labour market ahead with further job shedding and a potentially quicker pace of increase in the unemployment rate.'Ms Ong said a weakening labour market and uncertainty about job security would dent the effectiveness of recent interest rate cuts and the federal government's $10.4 billion stimulus package.'Just how far the unemployment rate rises over the next 18 months will factor heavily into the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy deliberations,' she said.
