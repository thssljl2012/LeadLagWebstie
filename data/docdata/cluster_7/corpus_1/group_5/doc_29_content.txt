More than half of all businesses expect the global economic downturn underway will continue to put pressure on sales and profits in 2009, a survey says.  A Dun &amp;amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;amp;B) business expectations survey found 58% of executives expect profits to fall in the March quarter of 2009.  Moreover, 54% of respondents said they were preparing for a drop off in sales over the same period.  'The decline reflects the slowdown in consumer spending, which has been noticed by 28% of firms, and the poor results experienced in the first three quarters of 2008,'' the report, released on Monday, said.  Interest rates were the number one concern for most executives, despite a sharp reduction in the official cash rate from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) over the past three months.  D&amp;amp;B chief executive Christine Christian said the there was hope among executives that the RBA's actions would help promote spending.  But she said the size of recent cuts 'indicates that the current downturn is likely to impact Australian businesses into 2009''.  The RBA has reduced the cash rate by 300 basis points, or three percentage points, to 4.25% at its past four board meetings.  Although recent falls at the pump has eased the impact of petrol prices, the cost of fuel remained at the forefront of executives' minds, as did the volatile Australian dollar.  The report found 73% of executives said their businesses had been hurt by the local currency's dramatic fall from 98.49 US cents in mid-July to about 60 US cents in late October, with wholesalers suffering the biggest impact.  'Falling commodities prices have caused the Australian dollar to drop markedly in recent months, forcing businesses to pay more for their imports,'' Ms Christian said in a statement.  'On top of this, the global liquidity crisis has also resulted in significant cash flow challenges for some businesses and forced many organisations to postpone growth plans as access to credit has dried up.''  While economists believed the threat of inflation had receded and was now expected to fall, the survey found selling price pressures remained alive and well.  The survey's measure of selling prices rose 17 index points to 79 points - its highest reading in the history of the survey - with 82% of firms expecting to raise prices, compared with 3% expecting a decrease.  D&amp;amp;B economic consultant Dr Duncan Ironmonger said he expected Australia to come through the current global downturn 'in better shape than most industrial countries''.
