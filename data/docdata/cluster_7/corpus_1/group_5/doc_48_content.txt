TOKYO, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Japan's annual core consumer inflation slowed in November as energy costs continued to retreat from their summer peaks, while industrial output slumped, underscoring fears the world's No. 2 economy will return to deflation next year.  In a sign of further trouble for an economy already in recession, the ratio of jobs available to those looking for work fell to a nearly five-year low.  ************************************************************  KEY POINTS:  -- Annual nationwide core consumer inflation slowed to 1.0 percent in November from 1.9 percent in October, lower than a consensus forecast of 1.1 percent.  -- Tokyo area core consumer inflation slowed to 0.8 percent in December from 1.1 percent in November, matching a consensus forecast.  -- Industrial output fell 8.1 percent in November, posting the largest fall on record and dropping more than a median market forecast for a 6.8 percent slide.  -- The jobless rate rose to 3.9 percent in November from 3.7 percent in October, less than a median market forecast of 4.0 percent.  -- The jobs-to-applicants ratio for November fell to a near five-year low of 0.76 from 0.80 in October, slightly lower than the median market forecast. The number means 76 jobs were available per 100 applicants.  -- The Nomura/JMMA Japan Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) showed manufacturing activity contracted for the 10th straight month in December to a new record low.  COMMENTARY:  YASUO YAMAMOTO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MIZUHO RESEARCH INSTITUTE  'The output data was worse than expected and production declined not only among export-oriented industries such as automakers but also industries overall.  'As the November data shows, inventories have risen despite a decline in output. This means there is no sign of a halt in the falling trend in output yet.  'With companies such as automakers and semiconductor makers suspending production lines during the year-end to the beginning of the next year due to falling demand from overseas, the downward trend in Japan's industrial production is likely to continue.  'The Bank of Japan may not lower interest rate as it is already near zero. Rather the central bank will likely expand measures to help corporations' funding.'  KYOHEI MORITA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, JAPAN, BARCLAYS CAPITAL  'The data reaffirmed a sharp slowdown in consumer inflation due to falls in oil prices, the yen's rise and declines in raw material prices. But the trend has not yet reflected a worsening of the economy. It will probably take three quarters to reflect that, so I expect consumer prices will be pushed down further around the July-September quarter next year by the economic downturn.  'From around June, I expect consumer prices to start falling from a year earlier, and that trend will likely continue in 2009 and then towards the latter half of 2010. If we call that deflation, Japan will likely fall into deflation from next June.  'The Bank of Japan will likely focus on steps to help corporate finance for a while, and it should be the job of government fiscal policy to deal with the real economy at the moment.'  TAKESHI MINAMI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NORINCHUKIN RESEARCH INSTITUTE  'The rise in core CPI subsided from the previous month mainly due to declining gasoline prices. As crude oil prices have slumped to about $30, core CPI could begin to log year-on-year falls from around May next year.  'In light of growing deflation fears in the global economy, the Bank of Japan could soon be pressured into implementing policy steps that could be defined as quantitative easing. One possible and feasible measure would be raising the amount of JGBs it buys from the market.  'The latest jobless rate rose from the previous month as expected. As more part-time and contract workers are being laid off, the rate will likely rise over 4 percent.'
