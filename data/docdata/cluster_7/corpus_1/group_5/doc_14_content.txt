WELLINGTON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - New Zealand's annual current account deficit widened in the third quarter on higher priced oil imports. The annual deficit stood at NZ$15.5 billion ($8.9 billion) in the September quarter compared with a NZ$14.9 billion deficit in the previous quarter, data showed on Monday. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast an annual deficit of NZ$15.5 billion. The data is not expected to affect the central bank's interest rate outlook. *************************************************************** KEY POINTS: - Q3 seasonally adjusted deficit NZ$4.08 billion from NZ$4.6 billion in Q2 as foreign investors earned less from their New Zealand investments. - Actual, unadjusted Q3 deficit NZ$5.99 billion vs forecast deficit of NZ$6 billion. - Deficit put at 8.6 percent of GDP, compared with 8.4 percent in Q2.

Some of that was a case of history, drought, the exchange rate and weakening terms of trade, but it is enlarging at a time when it would be preferable for it to be shrinking, and in the short term it should widen further.' SU-LIN ONG, SENIOR ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS 'The deficit was much as expected, but that doesn't make it any less ugly. Exports were under pressure from falling commodity and dairy prices, while import values were lifted in part by the weaker Kiwi dollar. 'The deficit is heading in the wrong direction and our concern is what this might mean for New Zealand's credit rating. Crucially, the budget outlook has deteriorated and the ratings agencies have counted on strong government savings to compensate for the country's structural current account imbalance. 'Ultimately, we doubt New Zealand will be downgraded, but it's a risk investors should be aware of.' JOSHUA WILLIAMSOM, SENIOR STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES 'It is in line with expectations, but it is still much larger than the second quarter. This shows that the external imbalances are widening. This is becoming more of a concern, more so because we are expecting a severe and prolonged recession in New Zealand. 'It doesn't mean a lot for the kiwi because it was in line with expectations, and we are not expecting a lot of trade this week ahead of the holidays. 'But the deficit should narrow next year with fewer imports as the economy slows.' MARKET REACTION: The New Zealand dollar was unchanged after the data at $0.5743/53, while the March bank bill contract was flat with the yield at 4.41 percent compared with the 5 percent cash rate.
