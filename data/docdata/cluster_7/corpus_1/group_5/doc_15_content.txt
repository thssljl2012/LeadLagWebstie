HEARTENING. That's the word Treasurer Wayne Swan used yesterday to describe new figures that show a slight rebound in confidence in Australia's economic future.  Yesterday gave us the first indications that successive cuts in official interest rates and a fall in fuel prices, combined with the Federal Government's $10.4 billion stimulus package, are finally gaining traction with cautious consumers.  The Westpac-Melbourne Institute Index of Consumer Sentiment rebounded strongly by 7.5 per cent.  Westpac chief economist Bill Evans described the results as something of a surprise, given that 'the gloom surrounding the global economy and the associated threat to Australia could have easily overwhelmed all the positives'.Mr Evans said that of most significance was the 28 per cent jump in positive sentiment regarding whether now was a good time to buy a major household item.'It is sending a welcome message to beleaguered retailers as they move into the critical last few weeks before Christmas,' he said.According to Mr Swan: 'It's pleasing today to see consumer sentiment figures which certainly do reflect a lift in consumer confidence.'We can't read too much into one set of figures - but certainly these figures show that Australians are backing the economy,' he said.The figures were 'encouraging and heartening', the Treasurer said.  On housing, the WMI Index indicates a strong revival in residential construction next year, and the Time to Buy a Dwelling Index is now at its highest level since March 2002, when the last housing boom began to take hold.  Further evidence of the recovery in the housing sector was evident yesterday when figures for October housing finance approvals released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics increased by 1.3 per cent - their first rise since January this year.  Importantly, these numbers relate to the month before the Reserve Bank's last two aggressive reductions of interest rates, leading economists to the conclusion that the figures could be heralding the start of a recovery.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief economist Michael Blythe said potential homebuyers were responding to the RBA's large interest rate cuts, as well as the boost to the first-home owners grant.'The aggressive easing undertaken by the RBA since September has shown its first signs in the October housing finance data,' Mr Blythe said. Housing Industry Association chief economist Harley Dale said the figures were encouraging but it was still very early days.'The number of loans was still 24 per cent down on the numbers for October last year, a sign of just how weak the home lending market is now,' Mr Dale said in a statement.'Nevertheless, amid a constant barrage of negative updates on the economy, we did get a rise, albeit a small one.'- with AAP
