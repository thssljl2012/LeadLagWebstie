THE dollar was higher at noon, as positive sentiment from local and overseas share markets lifted the currency above $US0.6500.  At 12pm (AEDT), the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6505/10, up from Friday's close of $US0.6442/45.  During the morning, the local unit traded between a low of $US0.6457 and a high of $US0.6505.  The dollar started the local session at $US0.6460/65 at 7am (AEDT), after being dragged higher after Friday night's positive session on Wall Street.  The US Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 3 per cent despite employment data which showed more than half a million people lost their jobs in the US in November.  Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Joesph Capurso said some investors thought the US jobs data indicated a bottom in the market. 'That actually got investors thinking that maybe the falls or the lows in the US stock market had reached their bottom so they bid it up and that took the Aussie up along for the ride,' Mr Capurso said. 'It's continued that trend, although at a much slower rate, this morning.' The share market followed the US lead when it opened on Monday morning - the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was up 3.38 per cent at 12pm (AEDT), while the broader All Ordinaries had risen 3.07 per cent.  Mr Capurso said he did not expect the positive sentiment on equity markets to last, given the likely stream of further poor economic data due for release. 'We think markets will then start to move in the other direction,' Mr Capurso said. He expected the Australian dollar to struggle to hold above $US0.6500 for the remainder of the local session. 'I think the markets are defying gravity at the moment, but gravity eventually wins over,' Mr Capurso said. There was one piece of local economic data today - a survey from ANZ found  in newspapers and on the internet fell by 8.6 per cent, seasonally adjusted, in November.
