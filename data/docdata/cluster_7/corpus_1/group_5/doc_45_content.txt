MORE than half of all businesses expect the global economic downturn to continue to put pressure on sales and profits next year.  A Dun &amp;amp; Bradstreet business expectations survey found that 58 per cent of executives expect profits to fall in the March quarter of the new year. Moreover, 54 per cent of respondents said they were preparing for a drop in sales over the same period.  'The decline reflects the slowdown in consumer spending, which has been noticed by 28 per cent of firms, and the poor results experienced in the first three-quarters of 2008,' the report said.  Interest rates were the number one concern for most executives, despite a sharp reduction in the official cash rate from the Reserve Bank of Australia over the past three months.  Dun &amp;amp; Bradstreet's chief executive, Christine Christian, said there was hope among executives that the bank's actions would help promote spending. But the size of recent cuts indicated 'the current downturn is likely to impact Australian businesses into 2009'.  Over its past four board meetings the Reserve has reduced the cash rate by 3 percentage points, to 4.25 per cent.  Although recent falls at the pump have eased the impact of petrol prices, the cost of fuel remained at the forefront of executives' minds, as did the volatile Australian dollar.  The report found 73 per cent of executives said their businesses had been hurt by the local currency's dramatic fall from US98.49c in mid-July to about US60c in late October.  'Falling commodities prices have caused the Australian dollar to drop markedly in recent months, forcing businesses to pay more for their imports,' Ms Christian said.  'On top of this, the global liquidity crisis has also resulted in significant cash-flow challenges for some businesses and forced many organisations to postpone growth plans.'
