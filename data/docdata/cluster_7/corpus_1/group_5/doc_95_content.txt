Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  THE dollar was lower at noon on improving US dollar sentiment.  At 12.00pm (AEDT) the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6828/33, down from Friday's close of $US0.6858/65.  During the morning, the local unit traded between a low of $US0.6803 and a high of $US0.6838.  The dollar reached $US0.6920 during Friday night's New York trading session, when the US Government announced it would loan $US17.4 billion ($25.49 billion) to troubled US automotive firms.  But the unit failed to sustain the rally and promptly dropped back below $US0.6900, before opening the local session at $US0.6832/37 at 7.00am.  A senior currency strategist at financial markets research group Forecast, Lee Wai Tuck, said the market moves suggested some investors believed the recent bout of US dollar weakness had been overdone.  'It seems that the perception is that the recent fall in the US dollar - with the euro going up to $US1.4700 and US dollar/yen dropping to 87 lows - it may have been a bit too much,'' Mr Lee said from Singapore.  'So there's a bit of a correction at the moment.''  The dollar was stronger against the Japanese yen during morning trade, benefiting from weak data from Japan.  Japanese exports fell 26.7 per cent in the 12 months to November, the sharpest recorded decline since statistics began to be compiled in 1980.  Also, the Reuters Tankan survey showed sentiment among Japanese manufacturers reached an historic low in December.  'That's actually weighing a bit on the yen,'' Mr Lee said.  At 12.00pm the Australian dollar was trading at 61.39/46 Japanese yen, up from Friday's close of 61.19/26 yen.  The weaker yen was welcomed by Japanese equity markets, with the Nikkei 225 index up more than 1 per cent.  Mr Lee said market conditions were thin ahead of the Christmas period.  The Reserve Bank of Australia's trade weighted index was at 54.8, up from Friday's close of 54.7.  Meanwhile, the Australian bond market was weaker at noon.  The yield on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was 4.093 per cent, up from Friday's close of 4.023 per cent, while the yield on the June 2011 bond was at 3.140 per cent, up from 3.093 per cent.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange the March 10-year bond futures contract price was at 95.895, down from Friday's close of 95.965, while the March three-year bond futures contract price was at 96.635, down from 96.670.
