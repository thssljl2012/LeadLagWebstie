Latest figures confirm that New Zealand's recession deepened in the three months to September, as the economy shrunk for the third consecutive quarter.  Statistics New Zealand data out on Tuesday showed gross domestic product contracted 0.4 per cent in the September quarter. The decline follows falls of 0.3 per cent in the March quarter and 0.2 per cent in the June quarter.  ANZ Bank said confirmation of three quarters of contraction was old news. 'Forward indicators suggest that this recession is far from over, and there is a possibility that we face a fourth consecutive quarter of contraction in Q4.' The result was slightly under expectations in a Reuters poll of economists, in which the median forecast was a quarterly decline in GDP of 0.5 per cent.  For the year to September, GDP was up 1.7 per cent.
