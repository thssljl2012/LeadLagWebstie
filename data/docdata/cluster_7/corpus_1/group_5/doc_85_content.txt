SYDNEY, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank on Thursday said it would offer $11 billion in a repurchase tender, part of a global effort to ease liquidity constraints in U.S. dollar debt markets. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) offered to lend $11 billion in a 84-day repurchase tender on Monday. The previous 21-day repo conducted in November drew bids for just $2.74 billion of the $10 billion on offer. This repo may draw more demand as it covers the year-end when many banks and funds prefer to be as liquid as possible. This will be the fourth RBA repo of U.S. dollars after it and a number of other central banks established and then expanded U.S. dollar swap lines with the Federal Reserve to meet a desperate demand for dollar liquidity.
