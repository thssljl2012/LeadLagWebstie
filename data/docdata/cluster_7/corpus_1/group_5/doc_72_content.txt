The Australian dollar was firmer at noon as the highest US jobless claims since the early 1980s weakened the US unit against a range of currencies.  Expectations of another shocking US retail sales number, due for release on Friday night, are tipped to keep the local currency above $US0.6700 during afternoon trade.  At 1200 AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6690/95, up 1.5 per cent, or a full US cent, from Thursday's close of $US0.6591/95.  During the morning, the local unit traded between an opening high of $US0.6739 and a late morning low of $US0.6681.  Overnight, the Australian dollar hit 68 US cents for the first time since early November.  The high point also marked a 13 per cent improvement on late October's five-and-a-half-year low of $US0.6012, but the Australian dollar has still lost more than 31 per cent since hitting a 25-year high of $US0.9849 in mid-July.  The domestic currency benefited during offshore trade as the worst US jobless claims data in 26 years weakened the US dollar, sending the euro to a two-month high.  New claims for US unemployment benefits rose 58,000 to 573,000 in the week ending December 6, the US Department of Labour said.  It was the largest number of people applying for benefits since November 1982.  ICAP senior economist Adam Carr said the dire US employment data boosted currencies across the spectrum, including the Australian dollar. 'We've seen the US dollar sink against most major currencies,' he said. 'The jobless claims didn't help, being the lowest since 1982. 'The news flow is bearish for US dollar.' The Australian dollar was expected to hold above $US0.6700 on Friday night as traders expected US retail sales data for November to show another steep decline. 'The balance of risk to US retail sales is to the downside,' Mr Carr said. Economists are tipping a 1.9 per cent decline for the month. 'The US retail sales will be weak,' Mr Carr said. 'There's not a lot of support for US consumers.' At 1200 AEDT, the Reserve Bank of Australia's trade weighted index was at 54.7, up from Thursday's close of 54.0.  The Australian bond market was firmer at noon.  At 1200 AEDT, the yield on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was at 4.273 per cent, down marginally from Thursday's close of 4.275 per cent, while the yield on the June 2011 bond was at 3.190 per cent, down from 3.345 per cent.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December 10-year bond futures contract price was at 95.760, up from Thursday's close of 95.745, while the December three-year contract price was at 96.765, up from 96.620.
