(RTTNews) - Consumer confidence in Australia staged a comeback in December, according to the latest survey from Westpac Bank and the Melbourne Institute.  The group's Consumer Sentiment Index, published Wednesday, rose by 6.5 points or 7.5 percent in December.  The index remained 18.2 percent below its level in December 2007.  The survey of 1,200 people rose 4.3 percent in November.  The survey was conducted shortly after the 100 basis point cut in interest rates taken last week by the Reserve Bank of Australia, a move that sent rates to 4.25 percent. The lower rate was reflected in the mortgage holders category, where sentiment in December increased 11 percent.  The index of family finance sentiment was up 5.7 percent for the month and 4.6 percent higher than one year ago.  by RTT Staff Writer  For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com
