Westpac Banking Corporation has defended its decision to not pass on in full the most recent interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).  Chief executive Gail Kelly said Westpac's decision to pass on the 0.8 percentage point reduction of the full one percentage point rate cut announced by the RBA on December 2 was wise, given that funding costs remained high. 'We have a track record over the course of this whole year of being very thoughtful and considered in regards to our interest rate decisions,' Mrs Kelly told journalists after the bank's annual general meeting in Sydney on Thursday. 'I'm very pleased with the way we've tackled that. 'There is no question that funding conditions remain very difficult.' Mrs Kelly said foreign banks were exiting Australia, leaving a funding gap and increasing pressure on local banks. 'In the very difficult operating environment we are seeing that some of the foreign banks are seeking to return to their home countries. 'That will put some additional requests for financing on the local major banks here,' she said. 'Certainly we are, and have been, open for business for all our customers here in Australia and we'd like to be able to continue to support our customers within Australia.'  2008 AAP Brought to you by
