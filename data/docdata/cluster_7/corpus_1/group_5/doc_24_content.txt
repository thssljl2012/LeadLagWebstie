The Australian stock market will offer investors the best buying opportunity in a generation in 2009, after the bourse suffered its the biggest annual decline ever in 2008.  Australia's main share indices are expected to rebound by up to 30% in the second half of 2009, making up some of the losses in 2008, as the yields on stocks eclipse those offered by cash or bonds and equity investors anticipate an economic recovery.  Investors in 2008 have ridden a 35% plunge in the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index to 3594.4 at 11.10am today, from the end of 2007, and a 37.5% slump in the broader All Ordinaries index to 3525.4, in a year marked by large corporate collapses and unprecedented fluctuations in financial markets.  the volatility is likely to continue into the first half of 2009, and the market may fall further before it gains.  The drop in share values has pushed up the average earnings yield to around 11%, levels not seen since the early 1980s.  The dividend yield is now around 8.5%, including tax benefits from franking, a level last reached in the early 1990s, and only twice before that.  The returns on shares are now significantly higher than the alternatives, with the 10-year government bond yielding a little over 4% and the best term deposits return about 7%.  Interest rate cuts  With economists expecting the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to continue to cut the cash rate in 2009, those returns will probably be eroded.  'You've got the market as cheap as it's been since the 1970s,' Platypus Asset Management portfolio manager Simon Bonouvrie said.  'At some stage, especially if the RBA keeps lowering the cash rate, people are going to focus on the equity market and take on more risk to generate higher returns.'  Mr Bonouvrie, who helps manage about $1.2 billion in equities, is expecting the S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index to rise to around 4500 by the end of 2009. That would equate to about a 30% return over the next 12 months.  History seems to be on his side.  The 32% drop in the sharemarket in 1974 during the oil shock was followed by a 49% surge in 1975, one of the best five annual returns.  During the Great Depression, shares fell 34% in 1930, then bounced 11% in 1931.  Cheap shares  The historical longer term performance after such slumps is also encouraging.  The 10 year return after 1990, 1974 and 1930, when the dividend yield rose to around today's level, was above average, according to AMP Capital Investors head of investment strategy Shane Oliver.  'Shares are certainly cheap, there's no doubt about that,' said Dr Oliver, who helps manage $101 billion of assets at AMP.  But while the long-term prospects for the local bourse look good, in the short term stocks are likely to continue their violent fluctuations.  'There will be continued big rallies and big dips in the short term,' Perpetual Ltd head of Australian equities John Sevior said.  Any rebound in the sharemarket also depends on a recovery in the US economy, where the domestic economic problems of the past 16 months originated.  What started as a problem in the little known area of US sub-prime mortgages and investment products related to the high-risk loans, caused a rapid rise in credit rates as banks refused to lend to each other, doubting whether they would get their money back.  That led to the initial falls in global and the Australian sharemarkets, led by financial stocks.  But credit rates stayed high as it became apparent the US sub-prime investment products were held by many financial institutions around the world. Continued
