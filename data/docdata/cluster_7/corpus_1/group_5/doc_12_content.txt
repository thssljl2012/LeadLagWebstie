The New Zealand dollar had a languid night with Christmas approaching and figures today expected to show the economy shrunk for three quarters in a row.  The kiwi was little changed against the major currencies at 8am today from 5pm yesterday.  It was buying US57.64c from US57.60c, and edged up to 0.4139 euro and 51.99 yen from 0.4120 euro and 51.90 yen.  The NZ dollar did sink against its Australian counterpart, buying A83.80c at the local open from A84.60c at 5pm. The trade weighted index was 56.21 at 8am from 56.20 at the local close.  ANZ bank said the September quarter gross domestic product figure, due at 10.45am today, could add a little extra spice to the Christmas financial markets but expectations would have to be well off the mark if the NZ dollar was to break recent trends.  The GDP data would confirm the economy contracted for the third successive quarter, but that was old news, ANZ said. 'Forward indicators suggest that this recession is far from over, and there is a possibility that we face a fourth consecutive quarter of contraction in Q4.' A Reuters poll of 12 economists' forecasts the GDP fell 0.5 percent in the three months to September, after dropping 0.3 percent in the March quarter and 0.2 percent in the June quarter.  The US dollar rose against the yen after the Bank of Japan followed last week's interest rate cut with a warning that the health of Japan's economy had deteriorated and was likely to get worse. But investors' equally dim view of the US economy hurt the greenback against the euro, which rose in holiday-thinned trade.  Traders said volumes were razor-thin in the lead-up to the Christmas holidays, aggravating even the slightest moves in the currency markets.
