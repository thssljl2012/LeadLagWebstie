The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut the cash rate by 100 basis points in December to boost confidence in households and businesses and in anticipation that its board would not meet again until February.  On December 2, the RBA board lowered the cash rate to a six year low of 4.25 per cent, from 5.25 per cent.  Board members considered it was appropriate to shift monetary policy from its roughly neutral position to a clearly expansionary setting.'The board saw a need for the reduction in the cash rate, and bank lending rates, to be large enough to have a noticeable effect on financing decisions of lenders and borrowers,' the minutes of the board meeting, released on Tuesday, said.'Members also took account of the fact that a board meeting was not typically scheduled in January, given that the local markets tended to be relatively thin over the summer break and statistical and survey data, as well as liaison information, were less timely.'Overall, members judged that the two-month break between meetings was one consideration in favour of a substantial reduction in interest rates at this meeting.'Last week, RBA governor Glenn Stevens did not rule out the possibility the central bank would not alter rates in January, although traditionally no meeting is held in the month.'I will not be at the office, but I won't be far from the office,' Mr Stevens said at the Australian Business Economists annual dinner in Sydney.  Debt futures markets are pricing a 25 basis point cut to the cash rate in January.  The board said the size of the December cut would place monetary policy in an 'expansionary setting', indicating interest rates would be at a level to help stimulate the flagging domestic economy.'Accordingly, members felt that, on this occasion, a reduction of 100 basis points was appropriate and would contribute to supporting confidence among households and businesses,' the minutes said.'Given trends in money market yields, the board expected that most lending rates would fall significantly.'Since September the central bank has cut the cash rate by three percentage points, reversing the 12 rate rises between mid-2002 and March this year.  Recent data indicated to the board that a significant moderation in demand and activity had been occurring, which would help the lower pace of inflation.'With confidence affected by the financial turbulence and a decline in the terms of trade now under way, members thought that more cautious behaviour by both households and businesses would result in private demand remaining subdued in the near term,' the minutes said.'Given these circumstances and the associated easing in capacity pressures, there would be downward pressure on inflation in Australia over the year ahead.'Global disinflationary forces were likely to assist in this regard, though members acknowledged that the depreciation of the exchange rate meant the decline of inflation to the target could take longer than would otherwise have been the case.'The Australian dollar has depreciated by around a third since hitting a 25-year high of 98.49 US cents in mid-July.  An appreciable downturn in the global economy over the past couple of months, with international forecasts suggesting growth in both developed and emerging economies in 2009 would be substantially lower than predicted a few months earlier was taken into account for its effects on the local economy.
