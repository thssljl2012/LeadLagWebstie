A slump in the domestic housing market, a further slide in household spending and reductions in exports and company investment levels all contributed to the reduction in growth, amid the world financial downturn.  Data from Statistics New Zealand showed gross domestic product contracted 0.4 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30 following falls of 0.3 percent in the March quarter and 0.2 percent in the June quarter.  The result was slightly below market expectations of a quarterly decline in GDP of 0.5 percent.  For the year through September, GDP was up 1.7 percent, the government agency said.  In the three months, manufacturing activity slid 2.5 percent, with the largest falls in food, beverage and tobacco manufacturing, while construction was down 1.2 percent. Declines of 1.4 percent in transport and communication, 1.8 percent in wholesale trade, and 1.2 percent in retail, accommodation and restaurants drove the decrease.  For the first time since 1991, service industries recorded a second consecutive quarter of decline, shrinking 0.2 percent in the quarter.  The surprise was that activity in primary industries rose 2.1 percent in the quarter, with agriculture up 6 percent driven by dairy production and cattle processed for meat. 'Forward indicators suggest that this recession is far from over and there is a possibility that we face a fourth consecutive quarter of contraction,' the ANZ Bank warned in a statement.  JP Morgan chief economist Stephen Walters said public spending was the only part of the economy that was growing. 'The corporate sector is clearly very pessimistic,' he said. 'This means that interest rates still have to come down.' Economists expect the nation's Reserve Bank to cut its key interest rate from 5 percent to as low as 3.25 percent in coming months. Since July it has cut the official cash rate from its high of 8.25 percent.
