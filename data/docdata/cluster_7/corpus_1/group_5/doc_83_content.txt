 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The dollar has given back most its earlier gains against the euro after a report on the U.S. housing sector beat expectations, which improved overall sentiment and reduced safe-haven flows into the greenback.   Though a report on pending home sales showed a dip in October, the decline wasn't as sharp as economists were expecting. The National Association of Realtors' index for pending sales of previously owned homes decreased 0.7% on the month, compared with expectations for a 3.5% decline.   This helped U.S. stock markets rebound from earlier losses, and lured currency investors away from 'safe bets' on lower-yielding currencies such as the dollar and the yen. Instead, investors began buying higher-yielding currencies such as the euro.   The euro is now only modestly lower against the dollar.   Early Tuesday, the euro was at $1.2905 from $1.2936 late Monday, while the dollar was at 92.62 yen from Y92.96, according to EBS. The euro was at Y119.55 from Y120.30, while the pound was at $1.4789 from $1.4904. The dollar was at 1.2110 Swiss francs from CHF1.2049 late Monday.   Despite the general move away from the greenback, the U.S. currency remains much stronger against the Canadian currency after the Bank of Canada cut interest rates an aggressive 75 basis points Tuesday, bringing the benchmark rate down to 1.50%.   The U.S. dollar was recently higher at 1.2632 Canadian dollars from C$1.2535 late Monday.   The Canadian dollar 'is expected to remain under selling pressure on softening economic fundamentals and falling crude oil prices,' said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon.   -By Dan Molinski, Dow Jones Newswires; 201 938-2245; dan.molinski@dowjones.com   Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=%2BMcNpk7BTRKDnX6TXbKO2A%3D%3D.
