Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  THE dollar was higher at noon after stronger commodity prices and further rallies on Wall Street lifted the currency towards $US0.6700.  At 12pm (AEDT), the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6613/17, up from Monday's close of $US0.6532/37.  During the morning, the local unit traded between a low of $US0.6605 and a high of $US0.6684.  The dollar opened stronger at $US0.6673/77 at 7am (AEDT), boosted by higher commodity prices and a rallying stock market during New York trading.  That positive sentiment continued at the start of Tuesday's local trading day, but the unit soon hit resistance just below $US0.6700 and fell back towards $US0.6600.  Head of currency strategy at NAB, John Kyriakopoulos, said Tuesday morning's price action mirrored the currency's previous attempts to break above $US0.6700.  'You did have a decent rally and there would have been a bit of cautiousness because we haven't sustained moves above 66 US cents for some time now,' Mr Kyriakopoulos said.  'We've had some moves above 66 US cents, but they haven't held.'  Mr Kyriakopoulos said the local currency reacted negatively to the latest NAB business survey, but moves were limited.  'I'm not saying that the currency is immune to bad news on the economy, it's just that there's an awful amount of bad news already priced in,' he said.  'The market's already pricing in probably a good chance of recession in Australia.'  The survey found business confidence fell to a record low in November, while business conditions also continued to deteriorate.  While the actions of US and other governments had managed to offset the recent run of dire economic data and improve market sentiment, Mr Kyriakopoulos said he expected any Australian dollar rallies to be limited.  'It's hard to say that you're going to have another four to five US cent rally from here while the RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia) is still cutting rates,' he said.  'There's still a lot of pessimism around about the global economy.'
