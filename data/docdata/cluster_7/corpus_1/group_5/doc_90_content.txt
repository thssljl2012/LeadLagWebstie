 Market watch top headlines Australian reports Aust markets:  :  :  World reports World commodities:  World markets:   RIO, WAN, QAN, STO, WBC, BLY, AEO, BOQ, OZL, FMG, FXJ,   AFP 2008-12-12   The US trade deficit rose unexpectedly in October as a weak global economy hurt both imports and exports and the gap with China widened, a government report shows.  The 1.1 per cent deficit jump in October to $US57.2 billion ($A87.0 billion) contrasted with analysts' expectations of a drop to $US53.5 billion ($A81.37 billion) and fuelled fears of a sharper than expected contraction of the world's most developed economy.  The politically sensitive trade deficit with China increased marginally to $US27.9 billion ($A42.43 billion) in October from $US27.8 billion ($A42.28 billion) the previous month, the Commerce Department report said on Thursday.  The total volume in US goods and services trade fell 1.7 per cent in October, with declines in both imports and exports, also pointing to a deepening global economic crisis, the report showed.  October imports fuelled by petroleum were down 1.4 per cent from September to $US208.9 billion ($A317.72 billion) while exports dipped 2.4 per cent across all the major categories to $US151.7 billion ($A230.72 billion).  It marked the third straight month of declining exports and imports, underscoring weakening US international trade amid the global slowdown from record peaks in July, when US exports hit $US168.1 billion ($A255.67 billion) and imports $US229.4 billion ($A348.9 billion).  The total trade deficit for the first 10 months of 2008 was $US590.9 billion ($A898.71 billion) with analysts expecting it to cross the $US700 billion ($A1.06 trillion) mark for the whole year. 'As world growth slows dramatically, and many of America's largest trading partners slide into recession, export markets are looking significantly more challenging for US firms,' said Meny Grauman of CIBC World Markets.  Export demand, a key support for growth in the first three quarters of 2008, 'is in the process of collapsing in response to recessionary conditions in Europe and Japan, as well as the sharp rebound in the US dollar,' said IHS Global Insight economist Brian Bethune.  The global slowdown is also curbing US investment in plant and equipment, noted Christopher Cornell, an economist at Moody's Economy.com.  Exports of industrial supplies and materials and imports of capital goods both fell in October, leading declines of their respective categories, he said. 'Investment is strongly procyclical, and these constitute another indicator of a global recession,' he said. The October trade figures also signalled a steeper decline in economic growth for the fourth quarter of 2008. They 'imply that a larger share of the rapid decline in US domestic demand will come from falling domestic production than previously estimated, pushing down GDP at a pace in excess of five per cent annualised,' said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist with Bank of America.  Exports of civilian aircraft were down 28 per cent to $US1.6 billion ($A2.43 billion), which could be partly attributed to a Boeing strike that ended late October.  Net imports of petroleum in October rose by 2.5 per cent to $US32.7 billion ($A49.73 billion) and experts said the trade deficit would have improved had it not been for the oil buying surge in the aftermath of the September hurricanes.  The trade deficit with Canada, the United States largest trading partner, narrowed by 21 per cent to $US6 billion in September. The gap with Mexico, the second largest trading partner, narrowed by 2.8 per cent to $US4.8 billion ($A7.3 billion).  The deficit with Japan rose to $US6.0 billion ($A9.13 billion) from $US5.6 billion ($A8.52 billion).  The yawning trade gap with China remains a concern as it accounts for nearly 60 per cent of the total deficit in manufactured goods, said the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition. 'The fact that a single country, China, now accounts for almost 60 per cent of the US trade deficit in manufactured goods should gravely concern president-elect (Barack) Obama and the Congress,' said Auggie Tantillo, the coalition's executive director.
