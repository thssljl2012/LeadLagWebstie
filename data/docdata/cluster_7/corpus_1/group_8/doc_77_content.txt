Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief currency strategist Richard Grace has suggested that the Australian dollar has reached the bottom of its cycle and is likely to break above the two month trading range top of US68.5c over coming months.  At this stage of the year, a rise in the dollar is likely to have mixed implications, with farmers generally yet to purchase their inputs, meaning they are still exposed to a welcome reduction in the price of fertiliser and chemical should the dollar pick up against the greenback.  However, unless the predicted bounce happens reasonably rapidly, farmers will have already locked in their input costs, meaning a declining dollar will lead to lower real term cash prices.  Mr Grace said that the comeback in the dollar was unlikely to happen soon.  An upside break will be difficult until we have seen a break of the tight-range in the major currencies, so partipants need to be patient, he said.  Mr Graces predictions come following the decision by the RBA to leave interest rates unchanged at 3.25pc and are in line with the CBA view that a terminal cash rate of 2.75pc, higher than that predicted by other market analysts, is more likely.   The relative insulation of the Australian economy to the ill-wind sweeping the world economy at present is another factor the CBA believes will be supportive of the Australian dollar.
