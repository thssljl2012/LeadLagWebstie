By Martin de Sa'Pinto and Jason Subler A drop in Chinese exports, sliding German factory orders and falling prices in Japan yesterday underscored the weakness of the world economy, even as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said governments were too slow in ridding banks of toxic assets. The depth of the problems facing the financial sector was highlighted by Swiss bank UBS, which said on Wednesday earnings would remain at risk for some time as it revised up its full-year net loss to Sf20.9 billion (R190 billion). This deflated optimism sparked by signs of recovery at US bank Citigroup, which had fuelled strong gains on US and Asian bourses, but European stocks rallied from early losses. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of pan-European shares was up 0.8 percent by 11am in London. 'So weak of late, the market has been latching on to the idea that financials have priced in the worst. The market has digested the UBS results and decided they are not as bad as expected,' said Bernard McAlinden, a strategist at NCB Stockbrokers. IMF managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said he still expected the world economy to recover from mid-2010, but only if governments moved quickly to implement stimulus plans and banks' balance sheets were cleared of toxic assets. 'On the bank restructuring side things are really lagging; I'm afraid that if it goes that way for two or three more months, then recovery in 2010 will be difficult,' he said. The effects of the downturn are being felt on trade flows, with China reporting that its trade surplus shrivelled to $4.84 billion (R50.8 billion) in February, much lower than expected. Exports fell by a quarter from a year earlier.  'China has finally and spectacularly succumbed to the world financial crisis on the export side and it's difficult to see why that would improve in the short term,' said Paul Cavey, an economist with Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong. South Korea joined governments that are pumping money into their economies with plans for a supplementary budget worth $20 billion in March to boost domestic demand. Despite governments' best efforts, however, economic data show no signs of getting better. Fears of deflation surfaced after Japan said wholesale prices fell 1.1 percent year-on-year in February, the biggest annual fall in nearly six years. Azusa Kato, a BNP Paribas economist, said: 'Price declines are spreading from materials to other goods, and consumer prices are likely to start falling.' In Germany producer prices fell 1.2 percent month-on-month in January. Manufacturing orders for the same month fell eight percent. 'The prospects for industrial production remain extremely subdued,' said the Economy Ministry. Britain said its goods trade gap had widened more than expected in January, as the trade balance with non-EU countries slid to a record deficit. - Reuters
