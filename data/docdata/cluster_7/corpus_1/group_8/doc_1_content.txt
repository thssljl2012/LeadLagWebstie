The National Australia Bank (NAB) monthly business survey's measure of business conditions fell nine index points to minus 20 points, a level last seen in June 1992,  The measure of business confidence rose 10 index points in February, to minus 22 points.  But the lift in business confidence followed the worst reading of confidence in the survey's 20 year history in January.  A reading below zero indicates pessimists outweigh optimists.  The February survey's measure of forward orders, trading conditions, export sales, profits, capital spending and employment all stayed negative.  NAB chief economist Alan Oster said areas expected to be recipients of the federal government's second stimulus package provided the improvement in confidence.  On February 3, the federal government said workers earning under $100,000 would receive a cash handout as part of their second stimulus package worth $42 billion to boost domestic spending.  This followed the government's first stimulus package where pensioners, families and carers received one-off payments, in total $8.7 billion, during December. 'While business confidence improved in February, that is very much driven from improved expectations in the retail and wholesale sectors,' Mr Oster said. 'In turn, those sectors are the ones most likely to benefit from the next round of government cash handouts.' Mr Oster said the economy was unlikely to recover in the near-term. 'There is little in the survey to suggest that activity levels might be bottoming with continuing falls in mining and manufacturing activity very prominent,' he said. 'Nor is there much solace to be found in the employment, forward order and capex data in the survey.'
