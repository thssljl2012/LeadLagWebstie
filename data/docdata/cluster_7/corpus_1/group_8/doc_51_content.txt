SYDNEY, March 6 (Reuters) - The Australian government is lobbying local banks to cut fees, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said on Friday, after a report found they were charging some of the rich world's highest banking costs at a time of economic crisis.   Rudd, whose government has guaranteed the deposits and wholesale funding of Australia's banks, said he and the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, had recently expressed their concern in talks with local bank executives about high fees and charges. 'Absolutely. The Treasurer and I have met again with the banks in recent weeks and we have raised expressly the question of bank fees and charges,' Rudd said in a radio interview. 'We will continue on this because everyone out there...is facing a really tough time and we don't want to see anyone adding to this burden by unnecessary charges,' he added. The report, released by Fujitsu Consulting on Thursday, said Australian households paid about 22 percent more in bank fees than households in Britain and 11 percent more than American households, partly because of weakening bank competition.  The report estimates Australian banks -- dominated by the four majors, National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank , Westpac and ANZ -- will draw about A$5.25 billion ($3.36 billion) in fees from households this year.  It said the big four banks could continue to lift bank fees and grow interest margins this year as they gobbled up market share surrendered by weaker non-bank lenders.  Australian banking lacks intense competition, partly because the four major banks are forbidden from taking each other over by law. Even the competition regulator said this week that the sector bore some hallmarks of a 'comfortable oligopoly'.
