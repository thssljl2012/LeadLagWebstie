Australia releases official February employment data on Thursday and analysts expect the jobless rate to rise to 5 percent from 4.8 percent the previous month. * Aussie traded at $0.6325, little changed from $0.6352 before the data release, but well below $0.6415 seen here late Monday. * Against the Japanese yen, it was down at 62.57 yen from Monday's 63.03 yen. * Aussie bond futures pared earlier gains as investors sold into their recent strength, even though sentiment across equity markets remained fragile. * Three-year bond futures were up 0.005 points to 97.02, while the 10-year contract lost 0.01 point to 95.895. * April rate futures showed investors are still betting Australia's weakening economy will push the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut interest rates by 50 basis points at its next policy meeting on April 7, from a record low of 3.25 percent now. * April rate futures lost 0.01 points to 97.2, indicating investors were pricing in a rate cut of 45 basis points in April. * According to calculations by ThomsonReuters, there is a 95.2 percent chance RBA will cut rates to 2.75 percent in April. * Economic news from across Asia on Tuesday offered little cheer. Japan's finance minister pledged to keep the country's recession-hit economy afloat. * An ailing Japanese economy is bad news for Australia because Japan is the top buyer of Australian exports. * South Korea's central bank dismissed speculation it overstated its foreign exchange reserves, which have dropped more than 20 percent in the past year as authorities spent $50 billion defending the plunging won.
