As a result, the average market AMD/USD exchange rate became 372.11 AMD/$1.  Ad of today it is 361.28 AMD/$1.  The prices for imported products have shown a rise of 205 in Armenia, though the prices for some home-made products have risen as well, Gevorgyan said.  She pointed out that the situation may worsen after April 1, when the new gas, energy and water prices officially take effect.  Although the rise will not be considerable, it may cause panic and a jump in prices, which will influence the economy, Gevorgyan said.
