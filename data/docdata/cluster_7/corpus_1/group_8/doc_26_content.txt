The Australian share market is expected to continue to rise on Monday, after United States markets strengthened for the fourth day in a row.  On Wall Street on Friday, stocks lifted in choppy trading amid optimism that the worst may be over for the financial sector and, perhaps, the US economy.  The benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average index rose 53.92 points, or 0.75 per cent, to 7,223.98, and the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 5.81 points, or 0.77 per cent, to 756.55.  The Nasdaq was up 5.4 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 1431.50.  CommSec chief economist Craig James said the local bourse could rise by 20 or 30 points on Monday.  That's basically 0.75 per cent, just like they had in the US, Mr James said.  We got a good lead in from European and US markets, another rise for the Dow, so it does set up an extension of the rally for ourselves.  The big question is: is this the end of the bear market?'I don't think that anyone has the answer to that. It's much too early.  On Friday, the Australian stock market closed more than three per cent stronger after financial stocks drove the biggest one day percentage gain in more than three months.  The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 109.7 points, or 3.39 per cent, at 3345.2, while the broader All Ordinaries index added 104.3 points, or 3.27 per cent, to 3294.7.
