TOKYO, March 12 (Reuters) - Japanese government bonds edged higher on Thursday on expectations that an auction of five-year JGBs may draw solid demand from investors.   Data confirmed on Thursday that Japan is mired in recession with the economy contracting in October-December at its sharpest pace since the oil crisis in 1974, buoying demand for safe-haven debt.   Bond selling by financial firms to take profits and cover losses on their equity holdings has ebbed, despite a fall in Tokyo shares, after remarks by U.S. bank executives eased worries about the health of the financial sector.   The Ministry of Finance offered 2 trillion yen ($20.55 billion) of five-year notes with a 0.8 percent coupon, as expected, matching with the coupon level offered last month.   The results will be announced at 0345 GMT.   'The market is getting the sense that a wide range of investors including major banks may buy the new issue, and the sale will go smoothly,' said a senior trader at a Japanese bank.   June futures rose 0.11 point to 138.61 after drifting in and out of negative territory in early trade.   Futures initially drew support from a jump in U.S. Treasuries the previous day but dipped briefly on caution ahead of the debt auction, traders said.   The benchmark 10-year yield edged down half a basis point to 1.305 percent, after rising as high as 1.315 percent to match a one-month high touched the previous day.   The five-year yield fell a basis point to 0.740 percent , reflecting potentially solid demand for the new issue, traders said.   The Nikkei share average was down 1.1 percent.   The Japanese economy shrank a revised 3.2 percent in the final quarter of last year, a slightly smaller contraction than forecast, but economists warned of further contraction in the next two quarters.   U.S. Treasuries rallied on Wednesday after demand at a record reopening of 10-year notes was not as weak as feared, while Wall Street rose after JPMorgan Chase's chief executive said his bank was profitable in January and February, echoing comments by Citigroup's CEO a day earlier.
