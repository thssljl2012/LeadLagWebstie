SYDNEY, March 12 (Reuters) - Australian employment rose  unexpectedly in February as firms took on more part-time labour,  but the jobless rate still jumped to its highest in almost four  years as many more people went looking for work.  Thursday's report also showed a steep fall in full-time jobs,  which tend to pay more. Analysts tend to place more weight on the  trend in the unemployment rate, which is rising far faster than  many had expected.  *************************************************************  KEY POINTS:  - Feb employment +1,800 mth/mth, seasonally adjusted (Reuters  poll: -20,000)  - Feb full-time employment -53,800, part-time +55,600  - Feb unemployment rate 5.2 percent, seasonally adjusted  (forecast 5.0 pct)  - Feb participation rate 65.5 percent, seasonally adjusted  (forecast 65.0 pct)  - For a brief data table click on  COMMENTARY:  HELEN KEVANS, ECONOMIST, JPMORGAN  'The rise in the unemployment rate did meet our expectations.  We expect that the unemployment rate will shift significantly  higher over the next few months. By the end of 2010 we actually  see it up as high as 9 percent.'  We do highlight April as a key risk that the RBA may deliver  another rate cut.'  JOHN EDWARDS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, HSBC  (nyse: HBC -  news  -  people )  'Today's numbers remind us of the resilience of Australian  employment given a relentless flow of bad news. The increase in  unemployment reminds us that we are not creating jobs  sufficiently rapidly to absorb new entrants to the workforce.  We are looking at a jobless rate of 7 percent in the first  half of 2010 and a flat GDP growth this year.'  BRIAN REDICAN, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MACQUARIE  'The headline number was very resilient again, but many  people have serious doubts about the reliability of that number.  On the whole, it's a weak report. Full-time jobs were down  sharply and the rise in the unemployment rate will have a  negative impact on consumer confidence. It will add to pressure  on the Reserve Bank to cut in April. We expect it to ease by 50  basis points.'  JOSHUA WILLIAMSON, SENIOR STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES  'The Reserve Bank is more likely than not to cut interest  rates because we do have a very strong jump in the unemployment  rate and a large fall in full-time work, which is going to drag  down hours worked and drag down full-time income growth'  STEPHEN ROBERTS, ECONOMIST, NOMURA  'It's a weak number. I see a very high chance of a rate cut  in April, maybe up to 50 basis points. I expect the jobless rate  to exceed 7 percent by the end of 2009 and be above 8 percent by  end of 2010. GDP is looking at negative quarters most of the way  through the first, second and third quarters with a possibility  to return to positive growth in the fourth quarter.'  MARKET REACTION:  The Australian dollar blipped higher on the  surprisingly firm headline employment number, but then faltered  on the high jobless reading. Interbank futures climbed  as investors bet the jump in unemployment would add to pressure  for a cut in interest rates in April after the Reserve Bank of  Australia (RBA) skipped a chance to ease this month.
