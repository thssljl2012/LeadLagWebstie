SYDNEY, March 12 (Reuters) - Australian employment rose  unexpectedly in February as firms took on more part-time labour,  but the jobless rate still jumped to its highest in almost four  years as many more people went looking for work.  Thursday's report also showed a steep fall in full-time jobs,  which tend to pay more. Analysts tend to place more weight on the  trend in the unemployment rate, which is rising far faster than  many had expected.  *************************************************************  KEY POINTS:  - Feb employment +1,800 mth/mth, seasonally adjusted (Reuters  poll: -20,000)  - Feb full-time employment -53,800, part-time +55,600  - Feb unemployment rate 5.2 percent, seasonally adjusted  (forecast 5.0 pct)  - Feb participation rate 65.5 percent, seasonally adjusted  (forecast 65.0 pct)  - For a brief data table click on  COMMENTARY:  STEPHEN ROBERTS, ECONOMIST, NOMURA  'It's a weak number. I see a very high chance of a rate cut  in April, maybe up to 50 basis points. I expect the jobless rate  to exceed 7 percent by the end of 2009 and be above 8 percent by  end of 2010. GDP is looking at negative quarters most of the way  through the first, second and third quarters with a possibility  to return to positive growth in the fourth quarter.'  MARKET REACTION:  The Australian dollar blipped higher on the  surprisingly firm headline employment number, but then faltered  on the high jobless reading. Interbank futures climbed  as investors bet the jump in unemployment would add to pressure  for a cut in interest rates in April after the Reserve Bank of  Australia (RBA) skipped a chance to ease this month.
