WELLINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - New Zealand's terms of trade   fell for the third quarter in a row in the fourth quarter as a   lower New Zealand dollar lifted import prices.   Export volumes fell 1.8 percent during the quarter on lower   crude oil exports as production declined. A rise in dairy   products helped to moderate the overall fall in export volumes.   The declines backed views that trade will remain a drag on   growth in the near term.   ***************************************************************   KEY POINTS:   - Q4 terms of trade down 0.9 percent (Reuters poll -2 pct).   - Export prices up 2.5 percent (Reuters poll 0.0 pct), led by   higher food and beverage prices.   - Import price index rises 3.4 percent (Reuters poll +2.9   pct), driven by higher computer and machinery parts prices.   - Terms of trade for services, mainly tourism, fell 6.5   percent, the largest fall since the series began in the June 1997   quarter COMMENTARY:   MICHAEL GORDON, MARKETS ECONOMIST, WESTPAC   'The weaker exchange rate through the quarter had quite a   sizeable impact on prices for both imports and exports, but   setting that aside, the major price movements are where we   thought they would be.   'Fairly widespread price increases for imports, reflecting   the currency, but quite a substantial fall for petroleum, to keep   the prices subdued.   'Import and export prices are close to what we thought, and   look like they'll contribute to Q4 GDP, which although it won't   be a great number, will get some small support from the trade   position.'   CRAIG EBERT, SENIOR MARKETS ECONOMIST, BNZ   'It looks a little more robust on the prices side and if   anything a bit weaker on the activity side, the volumes.   'For GDP it keeps the negative tone, although it may not push   it lower than the 0.6 percent fall we have, but it attaches a bit   of a downside risk.'   ROBIN CLEMENTS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, UBS   'It didn't fall as much as the consensus, but there was such   a wide spread of expectations, and a large part of that is   because export prices were up.   'It means that whilst export prices have been falling the   import side is affected too, the fact that terms of trade fell by   less means that channel is not impacting New Zealand quite as   harshly.'   MARKET REACTION:   - The New Zealand dollar was unmoved by the data at   $0.5040/45. The yield on June bank bill contract was also   unchanged at 2.81 percent compared with the 3.5 percent official   cash rate.

A rise in the terms means more imports   can be purchased, a fall means less imports can be bought.   - The New Zealand dollar trade weighted index, as   measured by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), fell 11.8   percent on the previous quarter. A weaker New Zealand dollar   generally increases export earnings, but also raises import   costs.   - New Zealand's trade deficit for the year ended Jan. 31   NZ$5.48 billion ($2.75 billion).   - The Reserve Bank is expected to cut its cash rate by at   least 50 basis points to 3 percent on March 12, on top of the 475   basis points of cuts since last July.   - The latest ANZ Bank commodity price index showed prices   fell for the seventh month in a row in February to their lowest   level in three years, although when translated into NZ dollar   terms returns rose 1.9 percent, the first rise in four months.
