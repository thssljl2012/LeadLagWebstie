Australian firms ran down inventories at the fastest pace in 22 years last quarter, dramatically increasing the risk of an outright contraction in the economy and adding to the case for more rate cuts.   Monday's figures from the government also showed company profits sank 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter, while a private survey showing Australian manufacturing activity hit record lows in February as demand slumped. 'The figures were awful,' said Rob Henderson, chief economist markets at nabCapital. 'We calculate that inventories took around 1.3 percentage points from growth. Without a huge rise from net exports, gross domestic product (GDP) will be negative.' Inventories fell 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter, confounding expectations of a 0.3 percent rise and the biggest drop since 1986.   This represented a subtraction from GDP of A$3.6 billion ($2.3 billion), or about 1.3 percentage points, when analysts had looked for a drag of just 0.2 percentage points.   That was a hard blow since GDP had been expected to have risen by 0.1 percent in the quarter, from the previous quarter. The data are due out on Wednesday, just a day after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) holds its monthly policy meeting.

'It means all the risks are to the downside and GDP could be substantially weaker now.' The risk of a sizable fall in GDP could prompt the central bank to cut its 3.25 percent cash rate at its meeting on Tuesday, even though it has been hinting it would like to pause after lowering its cash rate by 400 basis points since September.
