At 1630 AEDT, the yield on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was 4.120 per cent, down from Friday's close of 4.235 per cent, while the yield on the April 2012 bond was at 2.997 per cent, down from 3.099 per cent.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March 10-year bond futures contract price was 95.905, up from Friday's close of 95.790, while the March three-year bond futures contract was at 97.010, up from 96.920.  The Australian bond market rallied at both ends of the yield curve during both off-shore and local trading, outperforming US Treasuries.  Deutsche Bank fixed income strategist David Plank said the prospect of a weak labour force report prompted a move towards safe-haven assets. 'It's possible that nobody wants to be short our market into our employment data on Thursday,' Mr Plank said. 'The employment report could be anything, just given the nature of that employment report. 'We've had a couple of OK reports, we're probably due a weak one.' Economists expected the nation's to have lost 20,000 jobs in February, with the unemployment rate forecast to reach five per cent, up from 4.8 per cent in January.  Other local economic data due this week included National Australia Bank's February business survey (Tuesday), the Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey of consumer sentiment (Wednesday)and housing finance data for January (also Wednesday).  Mr Plank said weak equity markets also lent some support to fixed-income securities.  While local stocks finished in positive territory, albeit only just, bourses across Asia were mostly in the red during afternoon trading. 'Today was one of those days where a lot of the Asian equity markets were down. That probably helped sentiment,' Mr Plank said 'We've had a good day. We've rallied about 10 basis points since this morning.' With little US economic data due out for the week, Mr Plank said the focus would be on the $US63 billion ($A98.3 billion) issuance of US Treasury bonds and notes.
