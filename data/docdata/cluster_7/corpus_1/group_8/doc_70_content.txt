A Melbourne Institute survey of consumer inflationary expectations reports the expected median rate of inflation at 2.2 per cent in March, down from 2.3 per cent in February.  The March result was half the 4.4 per cent registered last October and the survey's lowest reading since December 1998.  Melbourne Institute research fellow Sam Tsiaplias said recent economic news had lowered consumer expectations of price rises.  Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 0.5 per cent in the December quarter, the first contraction in the domestic economy in eight years, Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data showed last week. 'The low inflationary expectations observed this month are consistent with the weak December GDP figure, and suggest that the potential inflationary effects of the Reserve Bank's easing in monetary policy, in the last seven months, have been extremely mild to date,' Dr Tsiaplias said. The survey of 1,200 people aged 18 years and older was conducted after the release last week of the December gross domestic product (GDP).  Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell 0.3 per cent to an annual rate of 3.7 per cent in the December quarter, official data showed.  Dr Tsiaplias said consumers expecting inflation to fall within the Reserve Bank of Australia's target range of two to three per cent rose to 9.9 per cent in March, up from 9.5 per cent. 'For the first time since September 2007, this proportion is higher than the 12 month average of 8.8 per cent,' he said. 'The median expected inflation rate of 2.2 per cent in March is also well within the Reserve Bank's target band, and is at its lowest point since December 1998.' The ratio of respondents who expect prices to increase rose to 53.3 per cent in March, from 52.7 per cent the month before.
