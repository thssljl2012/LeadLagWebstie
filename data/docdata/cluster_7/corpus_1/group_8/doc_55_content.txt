SYDNEY - Australia's central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at 3.25 per cent Tuesday, after deep cuts in the last few months to help stimulate the rapidly slowing economy.  The board of the Reserve Bank of Australia decided to end the run of cuts - for now - that have slashed the key rate from 7.25 per cent at the beginning of September to its lowest level in more than 40 years.  The bank and the government have moved quickly since late last year to try and stop Australia from following most of its trading partners into recession as financial markets plummet around the world.  Governor Glenn Stevens said the world economy remains very weak and stock markets and banking systems in several important countries are still under pressure despite massive stimulus packages. 'The Australian economy has not experienced the sort of large contraction seen elsewhere,' Stevens said in a statement. 'Nonetheless, economic conditions are clearly weak and given the speed and scale of the global economic deterioration and its effect on confidence, weak conditions are likely to continue in the near term.' He said the current level of the bank's key interest rate is appropriate for now but would be reconsidered in one month.  Analysts had mixed views about whether the bank would cut rates a fifth time in a row. Some had said it would wait longer to see if the economy would pick up in response to earlier cuts and a US$26.6-billion government stimulus package.  The decision came after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported retail sales - an indicator of consumer demand - rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent in January. That was far lower than the 3.8-per-cent increase in December but beat market expectations of a 0.5-per-cent fall.  The statistics bureau also reported Tuesday imports fell 6.8 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms in the three months to the end of December, the biggest quarterly fall in imports since 1982. Exports fell by just 0.8 per cent.  The figures suggest gross domestic product growth may be higher than expected.  GDP grew at a razor-thin 0.1 per cent in the September quarter. The December quarter figures are due for release Wednesday. If the September figure is revised downward and the December figure is negative, Australia would be considered technically in recession.
