The Australian dollar closed weaker on Monday after further worries about the fate of US financial firms caused an increase in risk aversion and dragged the local currency back below 64 US cents.  At 1700 AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at 63.97 US cents, down from Friday's close of 64.21 US cents.  The last time the unit closed below 64 US cents was on Wednesday, March 4.  During the day, the unit moved between a low of 63.89 US cents and a high of 64.51 US cents.  The Australian dollar rose at the start of the local trading week but turned south as Asian equity markets gave back initial gains after a senior US republican senator stoked fears about the fate of troubled US financial firms.  Richard Shelby, the ranking member of the Senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs said some banks should be allowed to fail rather than be bailed out.'If they're dead, they ought to be buried,' Senator Shelby told the US television network ABC.'We bury the small banks. We've got to bury some big ones and send a strong message to the market.'A senior currency strategist at financial markets research group Forecast, Lee Wai Tuck, said the comments triggered an increase in risk aversion and caused investors to exit equity markets and the high-yielding Australian dollar.'The nervousness continued over the future of US banks,' Mr Lee said from Singapore.'That's why the Aussie went down to $US0.6389.'Mr Lee said a positive finish on the Australian share market, as well the prospect of merger and acquisition activity involving Australian companies, helped the local currency stabilise.'Along the pipeline there may be some demand for Aussie dollars for Aussie assets,' Mr Lee said.'That's why you are still seeing interest to buy the Aussie on dips.'At 1700 AEDT, the Australian dollar was at 62.88 Japanese yen, down from Friday's close of 63.07 yen, and at 50.53 euro cents, down from 50.96 euro cents.  The euro finished at 1.2662 US dollars, up from Friday's close of 1.2599 US dollars, and at 124.46 Japanese yen, up from 123.72 yen.  The US dollar finished at 98.29 Japanese yen, up from 98.21 yen.  Meanwhile, the Australian bond market closed stronger after investors flocked to safe-haven assets ahead of a raft of key local data releases this week.
