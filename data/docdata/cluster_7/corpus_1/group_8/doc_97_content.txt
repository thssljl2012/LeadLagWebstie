EXTENDED sale periods, successive rate cuts and the Rudd government's stimulus package are behind January's better-than-expected retail sales figures, the retailers' association says.  New data shows retail spending touched a record high of $19.2 billion in January, a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent increase on December.   Retail sales had surged 3.8 per cent in December when the government doled out cash payments as part of its stimulus package.   Economists had expected a 0.5 per cent decline in January.   Australian National Retailers' Association (ANRA) chief Margy Osmond said the good news allayed fears of a downturn after the Christmas period. 'Access Economics analysis prepared for ANRA estimates that the combination of the stimulus package and interest rate cuts has boosted retail spending by about $1.3 billion over December and January,' Ms Osmond said in a statement. 'If the federal government and Reserve Bank hadn't intervened with aggressive monetary and fiscal policy stimulus, we'd be looking at a completely different set of numbers. 'Equally, if retailers hadn't extended their sale periods or used heavy discounting to attract shoppers, the results wouldn't be so positive.' The continued impact of recent interest rate cuts and the Rudd government's second stimulus package, worth $42 billion, would be 'vital' to maintaining confidence in the retail sector, Ms Osmond said.   The decision by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to keep interest rates on hold showed they were taking a 'watching brief' on the economy, she said. 'However, we'd remind them that consumer confidence is still very brittle with job prospects uncertain.'  What is this?
