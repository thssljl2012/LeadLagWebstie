* Dollar funds costlier, swap spreads wide as January levels  * June eurodollars price in 3-month LIBOR even higher  * New Zealand has wide-ranging rate cut expectations  * South Korean markets prepare for steady rates outcome  SINGAPORE, March 9 (Reuters) - Dollar funding costs climbed in Asia on Monday on growing fears ailing U.S. automakers and financial institutions, with dollar swap spreads moving to their widest since early January.  New Zealand's money markets braced for a reduction in policy rates by as much as 65 basis points (bps) when the central bank meets on Wednesday, while South Korean markets appeared set for policy rates to be kept on hold this week.  Despite the heightened aversion to risk, investors were strangely reluctant to hold safe-haven dollars even as they pushed down Asian share markets, notably Japanese stocks.  Credit risk weighed heavily on money markets as investors worried about automaker GM's ability to survive outside bankruptcy, and as Citigroup's slumping shares raised anxiety about other banks.  In Singapore, 3-month dollars  were quoted at 1.29833 percent, up from 1.285 on Friday and a steady rise from 1.09 percent in mid-January.  The TED spread , a risk measure of the spread between interbank rates and Treasury yields, rose to 108 bps while the spread between 2-year swaps and Treasury yields was at 79.25 points, as wide as levels last seen in early January.  More worryingly, June eurodollar futures were pricing 3-month LIBOR at 1.44 percent, a level last seen at the end of December.  'It's a number of things. No let-up to bank problems and quarter-end also playing a part,' said Ashok Sekar, director of futures and options sales at The Royal Bank of Scotland.  NEW ZEALAND, KOREA RATE CUTS  Elsewhere, there were wide-ranging expectations of how far the Reserve Bank of New Zealand will cut interest rates when it meets on Wednesday in markets torn between the bleak domestic economic situation and Australia's decision to stand pat on rates last week.  New Zealand bank bill futures rose  and overnight-indexed swaps  fell, indicating traders expect a rate cut, even if they differed on the extent. One-month OIS was at 2.87 percent, implying a 63 bps reduction in the cash rate.  'It could be 50 bps, it could be 65 bps,' said Imre Speizer, senior markets strategist at Westpac Bank. 'Anything from 0 to 50 bps will be disappointing and we would see rates go up.'  South Korean markets were primed for the Bank of Korea to keep the base rate steady at 2 percent, even though a Reuters poll [ID:nSEO174465] showed 8 out of 15 respondents forecast a rate cut.  Korea's benchmark 3-month certificate of deposit rate  has barely moved in the past two weeks, staying around 2.45 percent. The 3-month treasury bill yield was at 1.64 percent, down just slightly from 1.71 percent three weeks ago.  Those who felt the Korean authorities would be reluctant to cut rates again cited the won's weakness and the uptick in inflation as reasons. The won is down 19 percent against the dollar this year, while annual consumer prices inflation in February was a higher than expected 4.1 percent.  'Even before the last spike in inflation reading, the general sense is that Bank of Korea wants to hold back the last couple of cuts to preserve its ammunition,' said Woon Khien Chia, a strategist at The Royal Bank of Scotland. 'That inflation figure rubs it in further.' (Editing by Kim Coghill)
