SYDNEY: Australia's central bank considered cutting interest rates at its policy meeting this month but chose to pause to gauge the effect of past easing, noting there was still room for further stimulus if needed. In the minutes of its March policy meeting released on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) acknowledged the bleak outlook for global growth, but noted that previous steep cuts in rates combined with substantial fiscal stimulus were working to support domestic demand. As it was, the policy-making board decided to hold the key cash rate at a record low of 3.25 percent, surprising many in the markets who had bet on a cut. The RBA had already eased by an aggressive 400 basis points since September, dragging variable mortgage rates sharply lower and delivering interest savings of well over A$500 ($330) a month to those on an average mortgage. Still, the RBA left the door open for further cuts if needed. Financial markets are betting the RBA will have to cut again given the tide of grim economic news abroad. Investors are pricing in an easing of around 25 basis points at the next policy meeting in April, and an ultimate bottom beneath 2.5 percent. In particular, surveys of Australian business had found recessionary levels of sales, confidence and hiring. The RBA's decision to skip a cut came just a day before data on gross domestic product showed Australia's economy had shrunk by 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, the first contraction in eight years. reuters
