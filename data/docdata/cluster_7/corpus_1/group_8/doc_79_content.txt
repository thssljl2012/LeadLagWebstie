SYDNEY: Activity in Australia's service sector slumped anew in February reaching record lows as firms reported big falls in sales, new orders and employment, an industry survey showed on Wednesday.  The Australian Industry Group (AiG)-Commonwealth Bank Performance of Services Index (PSI) dived 8.8 points to 32.2 in February, with all sectors reporting weakness in demand.  The grim report suggests the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is not done cutting interest rates, even though the central bank skipped a chance to ease its monthly policy meeting on Tuesday.  'While this month's call on interest rates was understandable, there is scope for further rate reductions,' said Heather Ridout, chief executive of AiG. 'Monetary policy will need to remain agile in the face of numbers such as these.'  The survey's index of sales sank 6.6 points to 32.6, again the lowest reading in the six-year history of the series.  The heaviest declines in sales were in the wholesale trade, personal &amp; recreational services and transport &amp; storage sectors. Both retail trade and communication services saw previous growth evaporate in February.  Worringly, the index of new orders tumbled 11.5 points to a lowly 26.4, pointing to further pain ahead.  And in a grim sign for the labour market, the measure of employment fell 7.1 points in February to 37.9, marking the strongest rate of job-shedding in the survey's history.  'Very weak services sector activity is broad-based as both business and consumers clamp down on spending activity,' said John Peters, a senior economist at CBA. That pointed to further policy easing in coming months, he added.
