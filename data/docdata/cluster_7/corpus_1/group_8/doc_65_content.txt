Consumer expectations of inflation have fallen to a decade low as the economy continues to decline, a survey shows.  A Melbourne Institute survey of consumer inflationary expectations reports the expected median rate of inflation at 2.2 per cent in March, down from 2.3 per cent in February.  The March result was half the 4.4 per cent registered last October and was the survey's lowest reading since December 1998.  Melbourne Institute research fellow Sam Tsiaplias said recent economic news had lowered consumer expectations for inflation.  The report follows news last week that Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) shrank by 0.5 per cent in the December quarter. It was the first contraction in the domestic economy in eight years, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) figures showed. 'The low inflationary expectations observed this month are consistent with the weak December GDP figure and suggest that the potential inflationary effects of the Reserve Bank's easing in monetary policy, in the last seven months, have been extremely mild to date,' Dr Tsiaplias said. The survey of 1,200 people aged 18 years and older was conducted after the release of December's GDP report.  Inflation fell 0.3 percentage points to an annual rate of 3.7 per cent in the December quarter, ABS data has also showed.  Dr Tsiaplias said the proportion of consumers expecting inflation to fall within the Reserve Bank of Australia's target range of two to three per cent rose to 9.9 per cent in March, up from 9.5 per cent previously. 'For the first time since September 2007, this proportion is higher than the 12-month average of 8.8 per cent,' he said. The proportion of respondents who expect prices to increase rose slightly to 53.3 per cent in March, from 52.7 per cent the month before. The proportion of respondents who expected prices to stay the same or fall declined to 30.5 per cent in March, from 34.1 per cent.
