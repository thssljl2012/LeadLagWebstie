There has been an unexpected lift in business confidence as retailers and wholesalers look forward to the Federal Government's second round of cash handouts.  From tomorrow, families will start receiving $900 payments as part of the Government's $42 billion economic stimulus package.  The National Australia Bank's Monthly Business Survey shows a spike in confidence, despite business conditions falling nine points in February, to -20.  That is a level not seen since June 1992.  NAB economist John Sharma says the recent volatility in business confidence appears to reflect announcements of government stimulus measures aimed at consumers. 'Generally they're quite pessimistic, although on the positive side, we find that retailers and wholesalers are a bit more positive than a number of other sectors because they feel that they're the ones most likely to benefit from the stimulus package,' he said. 'These two are among the most confident of all sectors.'
