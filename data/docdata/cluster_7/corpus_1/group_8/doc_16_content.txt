The dollar was mixed on Wednesday as the market reacted to news of a sharp fall in Chinese exports, sparking fresh concerns about the spreading economic gloom. The European single currency eased to 1.2672 dollars in London trade from 1.2679 dollars late in New York on Tuesday.   Against the Japanese currency, the dollar slipped to 98.53 yen from 98.72 yen.   Traders had sold the dollar on Tuesday after US bank Citigroup's upbeat profit outlook sent world stock market soaring, reduced the currency's safehaven appeal, dealers said.  On Wednesday, global equity markets largely extended gains on a wave of positive investor sentiment despite more weak economic numbers.   It emerged that China's trade surplus and exports fell sharply in February as the world's third-largest economy took a harder than expected hit from the global downturn.   The figures took markets by surprise and analysts said the gloomy data would deepen concern about how China weathers the crisis despite a massive stimulus package aimed at bolstering the slowing economy.   Chinese exports were down 25.7 percent in February year-on-year, while the trade surplus stood at 4.84 billion dollars -- a dramatic reduction from more than 39 billion dollars the previous month. 'The China trade report for February released today has brought the trade picture more into balance with what is happening elsewhere around the world,' said economist Derek Halpenny at The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London. 'Of course, the collapse in exports in China is a clear reflection of the collapse in domestic demand in the US and elsewhere,' he said. Investors have bought the dollar and yen the in recent months amid the global financial crisis as the currencies are viewed as less risky than rivals such as the euro.   However, the yen appears to be losing some of its appeal owing to the sharp downturn in the Japanese economy and the dollar can come under pressure too when there is any positive news to trade on..   In midday London trade on Wednesday, the euro was changing hands at 1.2672 dollars against 1.2679 dollars late on Tuesday, at 124.86 yen (125.16), 0.9224 pounds (0.9222) and 1.4754 Swiss francs (1.4706).   The dollar stood at 98.53 yen (98.72) and 1.1643 Swiss francs (1.1598).   The pound was at 1.3738 dollars (1.3743).   On the London Bullion Market, the price of gold eased to 901.26 dollars an ounce from 901.50 dollars an ounce on Tuesday.
