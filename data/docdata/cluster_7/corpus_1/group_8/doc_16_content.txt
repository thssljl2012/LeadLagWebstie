The central bank had been sounding like it wanted to holds rates at 3.25 percent after cutting by a huge 400 basis points since September, and some media commentators had agreed.  * But the latest tumble in global equities and the risk that Australian GDP figures on Wednesday will show the economy shrank last quarter, argued for another cut right now.  * March interbank futures rose 0.065 points to 97.040, showing investors leaning back toward a cut of at least 25 basis points, and possibly 50.  * Local dollar dropped to a low of $0.6288, a level last seen on Feb. 2, and compared to $0.6332 seen here late Monday. Against the yen, it fell to 61.22 yen  from Monday's 61.69.  * Aussie bond futures rose as sovereign debt benefited from the safety flight out of equities, and as the yield curve steepened ahead of a possible interest rate cut.  * Three-year bond futures rose 0.075 points to 96.875, and the 10-year contract added 0.045 points to 95.77.  * Australia also releases at 0030 GMT its fourth-quarter current account deficit and export contribution to gross domestic product, and retail sales for January.  * Retail sales were boosted sharply in December following the government's A$10.4 billion cash handouts, but analysts are unsure how much of that bled into January.  * The median forecast is for a 0.6 drop in sales, but estimates range from a 3.0 percent dive to a 1.2 percent jump.  * The U.S. government rescued insurance giant AIG for the third time in five months after it posted the biggest loss in U.S. corporate history at $61.7 billion in the fourth quarter. [ID:nN02363433]  * HSBC launched Britain's biggest rights issue, raising 12.85 billion pounds ($18 billion) to help it overcome big losses in the United States, where it plans to shut most of its consumer lending business. [ID:nHKG49918]  * The onslaught of awful news pushed U.S. stocks to a 12-year low as investors fled risky stocks, and rushed for safer assets including Treasuries and U.S. dollar, which rose to a near three-year high. [US/] [USD/]  * Oil prices dropped 10 percent to $40 a barrel on Monday as a deteriorating world economy threatened to further hit fuel consumption. [O/R]  (Reporting by Koh Gui Qing)
