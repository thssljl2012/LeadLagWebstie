SYDNEY, March 3 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar hovered at a one-month low on Tuesday as a rout in  and more dire economic data from abroad revived the risk of a rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) later in the day. * The RBA announces the decision to its March policy meeting at 0330 GMT. The central bank had been sounding like it wanted to hold rates at 3.25 percent after cutting by a huge 400 basis points since September, and some media commentators had agreed.  * But the latest tumble in global stocks and the risk that Australian gross domestic product figures on Wednesday will show the economy shrank last quarter, argued for another cut right now.  * In another sign Australia's economy has yet to feel the full impact of the , Australia's agricultural bureau forecasted a 17 percent fall in the country's key commodity exports to A$162 billion ($102 billion) in 2009/10. [ID:nSYD462306]  * March interbank futures YIBH9 rose 0.085 points to 97.06, showing investors leaning back toward a cut of at least 25 basis points, and possibly 50.  * Local dollar traded at $0.6298, near a low of $0.6288 last seen on Feb. 2, and compared to $0.6332 seen here late Monday. Against the yen, it fell to 61.23 yen AUDJPY=R from Monday's 61.69.  * Aussie bond futures rose as sovereign debt benefited from the safety flight out of equities, and as the yield curve steepened ahead of a possible interest rate cut.  * Three-year bond futures YTTc1 rose 0.08 points to 96.88, and the 10-year contract YTCc1 added 0.065 points to 95.79.  * Australia also releases at 0030 GMT its fourth-quarter  and export contribution to gross domestic product, and retail sales for January.  * Retail sales were boosted sharply in December following the government's A$10.4 billion cash handouts, but analysts are unsure how much of that bled into January.  * The median forecast is for a 0.6 drop in sales, but estimates range from a 3.0 percent dive to a 1.2 percent jump.  * U.S. stocks fell to a 12-year low on Monday after the U.S. government rescued insurance giant AIG AIG.N for the third time in five months, and as Britain's HSBC HSBA.L hit shareholders with an $18 billion cash call. [ID:nN02404364]  * The drop on Wall Street is likely to lead Asian stocks lower on Tuesday, further weighing on the Aussie.
