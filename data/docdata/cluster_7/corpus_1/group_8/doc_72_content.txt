[GB/]  * Aussie interest rate futures  rose 0.045 points to 97.20, showing investors were back to betting the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will cut interest rates by 50 basis points on April 7 from 3.25 percent as the global crisis deepens.  * According to calculations by ThomsonReuters, there is a 93.4 percent chance of the RBA cutting rates to 2.75 percent in April.  * The RBA held rates steady last week at its monthly policy meeting, confounding some investor expectations for a 50-basis-point cut. Decision came a day before economic data showed a day later Australia's economy shrank last quarter for the first time in eight years.  * The local dollar managed to eke out modest gains, inching up to $0.6343 from $0.6423 late Friday. It gained slightly against yen to 63.18 yen  from Friday's 63.07 yen.  * Economic data from Japan, Australia's largest export market, affirmed views that the country is mired in its deepest recession in a generation.  * Japan set a record current account deficit in January, its first deficit in 13 years as the global crisis sapped demand for Japanese exports.
