Lower interest rates and increased government grants continued to entice buyers back into the housing market in January, new figures show.  Housing finance commitments for owner-occupied housing rose 3.5 per cent in the month, seasonally adjusted, to 55,628, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.  It was the fourth monthly rise in a row and slightly below economists' forecasts of a four per cent increase.  The number of loans for the purchase of new dwellings fell 1.4 per cent January, while commitments to build homes was up 2.5 per cent.  ANZ economist Alex Joiner said Australians were still entering the property market in January amid falling housing prices and low interest rates.  Between September and December, the Reserve Bank of Australia cut the cash rate to 4.25 per cent, from 7.25 per cent in August, a bid to cushion the local economy from the global economic downturn.  The cash rate currently stands at 3.25 per cent, following a further reduction in February.'People are getting back into the market at this time and taking the opportunity of softer prices and lower interest rates,' Dr Joiner said.'There is an opportunity to enter the property market now and that is why housing finance approvals are still rising.'The proportion of first home buyers taking out housing loans rose to 26.5 per cent in January, the highest share of first home owners since the data series started in 1991.  In October, the federal government doubled the grant to first home owners to $14,000 for established dwellings and tripled it to $21,000 for newly built properties.  Dr Joiner said first home buyers were leading the way.'They are getting additional assistance from the government,' Dr Joiner said.'If they are taking advantage of the government's handouts that will hopefully stimulate the building sector in the coming months.'The recovery in housing finance should be viewed with caution as economists forecast the jobless rate to rise significantly in 2009, Dr Joiner said.'They don't want to over-extend themselves in their borrowing, especially if there is a threat they may lose their job later in the year.', he said.The ABS will release labour force figures for February on Thursday at 1130 AEDT.  Westpac economists said the rise in housing finance commitments was in line with market expectations for a four per cent gain, and represented a solid result.'We expect housing finance to rise further in the months ahead,' they said.'However, as unemployment begins to lift significantly, the risk is that the recovery temporarily stumbles.'nabCapital senior economist Spiros Papadopoulos said first home buyers are still chasing the 'great Australian dream' of home ownership.'Indeed, first home buyers continue to set the pace in the housing market - 26.5 per cent of all financings in January were for first-home buyers.'Mr Papadopoulos said this was a record high in the data series, surpassing the GST-related peaks in 2000 to 2001.'This sector will continue to drive the growth in residential construction and new dwellings in the near-term,' he added.But investment lending is expected to remain subdued until the wider housing market improves.
