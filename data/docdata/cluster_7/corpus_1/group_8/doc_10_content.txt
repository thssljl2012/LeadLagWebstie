WELLINGTON, March 11 (Reuters) - New Zealand's terms of trade  fell for the third quarter in a row in the fourth quarter as a  lower New Zealand dollar lifted import prices.  Export volumes fell 1.8 percent during the quarter on lower  crude oil exports as production declined. A rise in dairy  products helped to moderate the overall fall in export volumes.  The declines backed views that trade will remain a drag on  growth in the near term.  ***************************************************************  KEY POINTS:  - Q4 terms of trade down 0.9 percent (Reuters poll -2 pct).  - Export prices up 2.5 percent (Reuters poll 0.0 pct), led by  higher food and beverage prices.  - Import price index rises 3.4 percent (Reuters poll +2.9  pct), driven by higher computer and machinery parts prices.  - Terms of trade for services, mainly tourism, fell 6.5  percent, the largest fall since the series began in the June 1997  quarter  (Click on for table)  COMMENTARY:  CRAIG EBERT, SENIOR MARKETS ECONOMIST, BNZ  'It looks a little more robust on the prices side and if  anything a bit weaker on the activity side, the volumes.  'For GDP it keeps the negative tone, although it may not push  it lower than the 0.6 percent fall we have, but it attaches a bit  of a downside risk.'  ROBIN CLEMENTS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, UBS  (nyse: UBS -  news  -  people )  'It didn't fall as much as the consensus, but there was such  a wide spread of expectations, and a large part of that is  because export prices were up.  'It means that whilst export prices have been falling the  import side is affected too, the fact that terms of trade fell by  less means that channel is not impacting New Zealand quite as  harshly.'  MARKET REACTION:  - The New Zealand dollar was unmoved by the data at  $0.5040/45. The yield on June bank bill contract was also  unchanged at 2.81 percent compared with the 3.5 percent official  cash rate.

A rise in the terms means more imports  can be purchased, a fall means less imports can be bought.  - The New Zealand dollar trade weighted index, as  measured by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), fell 11.8  percent on the previous quarter. A weaker New Zealand dollar  generally increases export earnings, but also raises import  costs.  - New Zealand's trade deficit for the year ended Jan. 31  NZ$5.48 billion ($2.75 billion).  - The Reserve Bank is expected to cut its cash rate by at  least 50 basis points to 3 percent on March 12, on top of the 475  basis points of cuts since last July.  - The latest ANZ Bank commodity price index showed prices  fell for the seventh month in a row in February to their lowest  level in three years, although when translated into NZ dollar  terms returns rose 1.9 percent, the first rise in four months.
