Westpac has become the latest bank to raise its long-term fixed mortgage interest rates, hot on the heels of similar moves by the other banks.  Westpac raised its 2 year fixed rate to 6.25 percent, up 0.35pc, with its 3 year rate rising 0.35pc to 6.5pc.  Its 4 year fixed rate is now 6.95pc, up 0.4 pc and its 5 year rate has been raised 0.5pc to 7.25pc.  This morning ASB raised its long-term fixed interest rates for the second time in as many weeks.  ASB raised its three-year fixed home loan rate to 6.50 percent, up from 6.15 percent while its four-year rate is now 7.15 percent, up from 6.55 percent.  Its five-year fixed rate is now 7.25 percent, up from 6.75 percent.  The bank has also dropped its floating rate to 5.80 percent from 5.95 percent.  TSB has already followed ASB's latest rise, bringing 4 year mortgage rates to 7.15 percent and 5 year rates to 7.25 percent.  This latest move suggests other banks will soon follow, as ASB was the first bank to raise long-term fixed rates on March 12 - the same day as the latest cuts to the Official Cash Rate - after months of falling mortgage rates across all banks.  Other banks followed ASB's lead within two weeks, with ANZ and National banks raising their long-term rates to match ASB's previous rates as recently as Monday.  Despite the OCR falling from 8.5 percent last July to the current record low of 3 percent, banks have recently begun hiking mortgage interest rates on loans of three years or longer.  Banks are blaming the rising cost of funding long-term loans, and ANZ National chief economist Cameron Bagrie has said the OCR is increasingly impotent to affect those rates.  Typically, banks must raise the funds for long-term mortgages by borrowing overseas. And if the interest rates our banks are charged offshore rise, so too do local retail rates.
