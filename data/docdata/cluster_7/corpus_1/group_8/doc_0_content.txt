The lowest interest rates in four decades has made Australians more confident about taking out a home loan even as the economy slows, a survey has found.  A poll by mortgage broker Loan Market Group found 41 per cent of people believed there had never been a better time to get a mortgage.  One in 10 respondents were even prepared to borrow more to take advantage of low interest rates.  Loan Market executive director John Kolenda said borrowers expected interest rates to be cut again, and wanted to benefit from softening property prices.  'The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has lowered the cash rate to 3.25 per cent and it's expected to come down over the coming months to two per cent, and that is obviously a encouraging prospective for property buyers,' Mr Kolenda said.  The RBA left interest rates on hold this month.  In February, it cut the cash rate by one percentage point to a 45-year low of 3.25 per cent.  Standard variable home loan rates have fallen below six per cent for the first time since the 1960s.  The online poll also found 34 per cent of respondents had maintained home loan repayments at levels before the RBA began slashing rates in September from a decade-high level of 7.25 per cent.  'Home owners taking advantage of the interest rate reductions this way will be saving themselves tens of thousands of dollars in interest in the long run,' Mr Kolenda said.  But six per cent said they had reduced their mortgage repayments so they could have more cash to spend.  Mr Kolenda said borrowers also wanted to take advantage of more generous first home-buyer grants.  'That is also likely to have a significant impact on the property market,' he said.  The Rudd government's first $10.4 billion economic stimulus package, announced in October, doubled the first home-buyer grant for established homes to $14,000, and tripled it to $21,000 for new dwellings.  The home-buyer boost is due to end in June.
