By Karolina Slowikowska WARSAW, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Poland's current account deficit widened in December as exports fell due to plummeting demand in the euro zone, and the government estimated unemployment has risen sharply. The official forecast of a 10.5 percent unemployment rate for January, the highest since March 2008 and up from 9.5 percent in December, underlined the impact of the global downturn on the EU's biggest ex-communist economy. The zloty currency, although largely unmoved by the current account data, lost 2 percent against the euro on the day as investors fled riskier emerging market assets. Poland's large cap index, WIG20, was down 4 percent at 1500 GMT. 'The data shows the economy is suffering more than expected from the euro zone recession. This is reflected in a very deep fall in exports, which reached 16.4 percent,' said Grzegorz Maliszewski, chief economist at Millennium Bank. 'This is a result of the worse-than-expected situation in Europe, our main trading partner.' The current account gap widened to 1.92 billion euros in December from a downwardly revised 1.637 billion euros a month earlier, central bank data showed on Thursday. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected it to reach 2.0 billion euros. The trade deficit stood at 1.688 billion euros in December. Underlining the spreading gloom, data showed euro zone industrial production plunged by a record amount in December, pointing to a deepening recession in the currency bloc. But the weakening of the zloty by about a third since an all-time high in July may help the trade balance by making imports more expensive and less attractive. 'The current account is likely to improve in the coming months due to faster falls in imports than exports because of the weakening zloty,' said Piotr Kalisz, chief economist at Citibank's Handlowy. Jozef Sobota, head of the central bank's statistics department, estimated the current account deficit stood at around 5-5.5 percent of GDP in 2008.
