The mortgage rate price war is entering a new phase with Westpac following Kiwibank's cut to floating rates by trimming both floating and six month fixed rates.  Westpac today cut its floating home loan rate to 6.49 per cent, down from 6.89 per cent. It also dropped its six month fixed rate to 5.79 per cent from 5.99 per cent.  This makes Westpac's six month rate the lowest in the market after BNZ's classic rate of 5.69 per cent.  However, Kiwibank still leads the field on floating rates, having cut its rate by 0.5 per cent to a historic low of 5.99 per cent earlier today.  The state owned bank's chief executive Sam Knowles said there were strong indications there would be a further cut by the Reserve Bank to the Official Cash Rate next month and Kiwibank was cutting in anticipation of this.  Westpac acting chief executive Bruce McLachlan said he believed there were still many uncertainties over the OCR review, but wanted to be proactive as people were looking closely at short- term rates in the current environment.  Knowles said the present interest rate market was 'extraordinary', having seen the floating rate fall from a high of 10.20 per cent five months ago to the current 5.99 per cent.  In comparison, the variable rate at ANZ and National Bank is 6.95 per cent, ASB's is 6.90 per cent and BNZ's TotalMoney rate is 6.49 per cent.  The Reserve Bank will next consider a change to the OCR, which is currently 3.5 per cent, on 12 March.
