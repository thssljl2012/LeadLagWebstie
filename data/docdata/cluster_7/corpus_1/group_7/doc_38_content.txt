The dollar retreated against the euro on Thursday as investors took profits from the greenback's recent rise and amid greater confidence on currencies in Central and Eastern Europe, dealers said.  The euro was changing hands at 1.2675 dollars late on Thursday compared to 1.2535 dollars on Wednesday. The euro also gained against the Japanese yen in London trading, rising to 119.30 yen against 117.45 yen on Wednesday.  The dollar was also up against the yen at 94.12 yen compared to 93.72 yen.'The US dollar is lower against most currencies, helped by hopes of a possible German-led effort to provide support for the weaker members of the eurozone as well as the Eastern European countries,' said Audrey Childe-Freeman, an analyst at US bank Brown Brothers Harriman.'That more positive sentiment is helping the euro to erode this week's losses,' she said. The euro hit a three-month low against the dollar on Wednesday amid fears over European bank exposure in Central and Eastern Europe.  Germany also announced drastic measures that would allow it to nationalise its banks for the first time in modern German history, helping ease concerns.  International financial institutions on Wednesday said they were also working on a plan to rescue the financial sector in Central and Eastern Europe.  The Hungarian forint, the Czech koruna, the Polish zloty and the Romanian leu all gained ground on Thursday after days of high volatility.  The market also continued to digest US President Barack Obama's strategy to help millions of homeowners avoid foreclosure and stabilize the reeling real-estate sector, including 75 billion dollars for at-risk homeowners.'Since it will likely take time to make an impact, similar to the stimulus plan and the revised bank bailout plan, we expect risk aversion will remain and keep the dollar supported,' said UBS analyst Geoff Kendrick in London.  The dollar can be boosted in uncertain economic times since investors tend to see it as a haven of stability.  Investors remained unconvinced by the 787-billion-dollar economic stimulus bill signed into law earlier this week by Obama, analysts noted.  And the dollar was also pulled lower after the Federal Reserve forecast late Wednesday that the recession-hit US economy would shrink in 2009.  In Asia, the Japanese central bank wrapped up a two-day meeting, announcing plans to buy up billions of dollars (euros) in corporate bonds from commercial banks as part of efforts to fight the credit crunch.  In London trading on Thursday, the euro changed hands at 1.2675 dollars against 1.2535 dollars late on Wednesday, at 119.30 yen (117.45), 0.8857 pounds (0.8818) and 1.4884 Swiss francs (1.4762).  The dollar stood at 94.12 yen (93.72) and 1.1743 Swiss francs (1.1774).  The pound was at 1.4309 dollars (1.4213).  On the London Bullion Market, the price of gold rose to 980.50 dollars an ounce from 964 dollars on Wednesday.
