SYDNEY, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Australian retail sales rose 0.8  percent last quarter as government hand-outs and falling interest  rates supported spending power, perhaps lessening the risk of an  outright contraction in the economy for that quarter.  The gain in real sales adjusted for inflation was smaller  than the median forecast of a 1.1 percent increase, largely  because prices rose by more than expected.  *************************************************************  KEY POINTS:  * Q4 real retail sales +0.8 pct qtr-on-qtr, seasonally  adjusted (Reuters poll median +1.1 percent, s/adj)  * Q4 nominal retail sales +1.8 pct, qtr/qtr  * For a data table click on  COMMENTARY:  STEPHEN ROBERTS, ECONOMIST, NOMURA  'It's a pretty soft result. It's quite modest when you  consider the amount of stimulus that was there in the  pre-Christmas period. It implies the Reserve Bank is expecting  GDP quarterly reading no better than flat.  'The combination of poor data from overseas and on balance  softish data suggests another rate cut in March, even if it's a  small one of at least 50 basis points, probably not 100bp.'  JOSHUA WILLIAMSON, SENIOR STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES  'It was weaker than expected, which shows that although the  economic stimulus package provided increasing sales in December,  it is not likely to be translating into increasing sales in first  quarter 2009.  'This would help put expectations at the central bank that  GDP growth will flatten in Q1...and suggests we are seeing  underlying weakness.  'Global developments will guide further interest rate cuts. I  am expecting a 75-basis-point cut in March.'  MARKET REACTION:  - The Australian dollar eased slightly after the data.  Bond futures remained sharply higher as worries over earu  zone banks and the global economic outlook dominated. Investors  are pricing in a rate cut of at least 50 basis points from the  REserve Bank of Australia in March.
