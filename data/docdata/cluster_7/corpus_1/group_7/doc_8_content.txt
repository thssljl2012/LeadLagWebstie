The Australian dollar jumped over half a cent after the Wall Street Journal said the US government may end up holding as much as 40% of Citigroup's common stock, citing sources familiar with the plan.  The dollar jumped to a high of $US0.6501 from $US0.6431 at around mid-day, up from $US0.6453 late in New York on Friday.  Local dollar also jumped against the yen to 60.30 yen on the Citigroup report from around 59.95 at mid-day.  The report also boosted the euro and sterling as traders said it eased fears a major US bank may collapse, easing investor risk aversion.  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke may offer clues on how the US government plans to clean up the financial sector when he delivers the Fed's semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Gains in the dollar may be capped by concerns at home that more Australian states could see downgrades after Queensland's credit rating was cut.  Standard &amp; Poor's cut Queensland's credit rating to 'AA+'' on Friday from 'AAA'' previously, saying the state's net financial liabilities as a proportion of operating revenue is likely to breach 100-110%.  Some analysts said Queensland's downgrade may shock investors because the state is a favourite among foreign investors given it is the largest seller of semi-government bonds.  Investors' flight to safety has pushed gold prices over $US1000 an ounce, and raised bids for US government bonds.  Aussie bond futures were up, with three-year bond futures rising 0.095 points to 97.005 and the 10-year contract up 0.12 points to 95.985.  US Treasuries soared on Friday as worries of bank nationalisation overshadowed a record $US94 billion sale of new government debt scheduled for this week.
