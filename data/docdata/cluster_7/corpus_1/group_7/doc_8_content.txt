Markets are pinning their hopes on the U.S. stimulus bill, ANZ National Bank Ltd. analysts led by Wellington-based Cameron Bagrie wrote today in a note to clients. Policy makers look prepared to throw the kitchen sink at the problem. Lets just keep our fingers crossed.  Benchmark interest rates are 3.25 percent in Australia and 3.5 percent in New Zealand, compared with 0.1 percent in Japan and as low as zero in the U.S., attracting investors to the South Pacific nations higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that currency market moves will erase profits.  Australias worst wildfires on record probably wont have any lasting impact on the Australian dollar, Morris said.  The wildfires left at least 108 people dead and may burn for days as winds fan flames across southern Victoria state, authorities said today. More than 300,000 hectares (741,316 acres) have been burnt and 750 homes destroyed with five large blazes still being fought today, the states Country Fire Authority said.  The immediate concern for the financial sector is the insurance costs, Morris said. There are also some concerns about the impact on agriculture but this has been rather small. The Australian dollar should be supported around 66 U.S. cents for the next couple of days.
