Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Glenn Stevens says economic activity would have been weaker without a fiscal stimulus package.'It would have been lower,' he told a House of Representatives Economics Committee hearing in Canberra on Friday.'2009 and to some extent 2010 would have been a lower pace of aggregate demand in Australia, absent those measures.'The federal government unveiled a $10.4 billion fiscal stimulus package in October that included cash handouts to parents and pensioners.  A new $42 billion fiscal stimulus package will give $900 cheques to many farmers, students and low to middle-income earners from April, as part of a $12 billion allocation.  Mr Stevens said no government could predict what the world economy would do, but stimulus packages were prudent.'It seems to me, what is in debate is will it be strong enough, or too strong, or about right?'That's always going to be hard to judge.'Do we want to have an effect in a year to 18 months from now?'That depends to a large extent on how long do we think the international situation will remain bad.'We don't know but at some point you have to make an assessment.'I think it (the stimulus) had a measurable effect over summer.'Mr Stevens said that even if households saved their handouts, the economy would benefit later.'That helps them be in a position to expand spending, even if that's some way down the track.'
