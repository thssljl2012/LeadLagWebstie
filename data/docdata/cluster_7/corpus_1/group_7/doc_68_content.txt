WARSAW, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Poland's current account deficit widened in December as exports fell on the back of plummetting demand in the euro zone and the situation was unlikely to improve soon, analysts said. The current account gap widened to 1.92 billion euros in December from a downwardly revised 1.637 billion euros a month earlier, central bank data showed on Thursday. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected it to reach 2.0 billion euros. Data also showed the trade deficit stood at 1.688 billion euros in December. 'The data shows the economy is suffering more than expected from the euro-zone recession. This is reflected in a very deep fall in exports, which reached 16.4 percent,' said Grzegorz Maliszewski, chief economist at Millennium Bank. 'This is a result of the worse-than-expected situation in Europe, our main trading partner.' Underlining the spreading gloom, data showed euro zone industrial production plunged by a record amount in December, pointing to a deepening recession in the single currency area. But the weakening of the zloty, which shed 30 percent since an all-time high in July, may increase the pace at which imports fall and improve the trade balance slightly. 'The current account is likely to improve in the coming months due to faster falls in imports than exports because of the weakening zloty,' said Piotr Kalisz, chief economist at Citibank's Handlowy. Jozef Sobota, head of the central bank's statistics department, estimated the current account deficit stood at around 5-5.5 percent of GDP in 2008. The zloty and bonds were little changed immediately after the data as the figures were broadly in line with expectations, dealers said.
