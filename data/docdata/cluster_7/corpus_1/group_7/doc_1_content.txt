0700 [Dow Jones] PREVIEW: China consumer inflationary pressures all but disappeared in January, PPI to fall for 2nd-straight month, as dwindling demand nudges world's 3rd-largest economy closer to deflation, opens room for more rate cuts, indicates Dow Jones poll. CPI last month tipped +0.6% on-year, 9th straight month of slower growth, to hit near 6-year low; PPI likely down 2.6% on-year in January vs December's 1.1% drop. ANZ Bank expects CPI to fall in February, heralding deflation at hand, as effect of Chinese New Year holidays disappears in February (week-long holiday fell in January this year vs February in 2008).
