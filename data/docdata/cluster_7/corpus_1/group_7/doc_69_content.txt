 Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens is a realist to say the least. His pessimistic outlook over the near-term failed to be outnumbered by his longer-term outlook of his engineered economy. In a semi-annual testimony to the governing parliament, Australias monetary chief Stevens stated that no policy response could stop near-term weakness. He further added that the South-Pacific nation would be suffering dearly in the coming 9 months as bad debts continued to rise. Unfortunately for the Reserve Bank, which began slashing rates in early June from 8.25% to 3.25% at the end of January, the effects of monetary easing has only begun, the Governor stated.   China  Stevens addressed optimism over Chinas economy. He went so far as to say that the Asian behemoth has yet to fully realize its economic strength. Indeed, their emergence hasnt finished, he professed. His strong belief that trade with China will drive his economy leads him to believe that the Australian economy will begin to recover in the following year.  Policy  Finally, Stevens pointed out that the bank will cut rates if needed. But as he pointed out, the effects of the fiscal stimulus, which was signed into law last week, will not be felt until the end of the year. Chances are, that with such a lagged policy effect that the RBA will cut in the near-term. Despite the substantial downside potential for overnight rate cuts, Stevens noted that there was little chance that they would be adopting a zero interest rate policy. He believes that rate cuts can get to the point of little impact. On a positive note, the Governor stated that half of Australian mortgages are actually ahead on payments and that interest rate cuts have worked best in his country thus far.
