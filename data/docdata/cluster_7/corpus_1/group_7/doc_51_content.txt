THE dollar opened at its weakest level in two weeks as US President Barack Obama signed into law his huge economic stimulus package.  At 0700 AEDT, the dollar was trading at $US0.6370/74, down from the previous close of $US0.6413/15.  It was the Aussie's poorest start to the session since February 3, when it began the day at $US0.6301/05.  During the offshore session, the currency moved between a low of $US0.6350 and a high of $US0.6450.  High-yielding currencies were sold overnight as traders doubted whether the US government's $US787 billion ($A1.21 trillion) stimulus would help the global economy.  President Obama signed the package into law early on Wednesday (AEDT).  OzForex corporate dealer Darren Richardson said traders were sceptical about whether the package would revive the global economy. 'There was another lag on equity markets combined with uncertainty over the stimulus package the US will provide the world economy,' Mr Richardson said from Toronto. 'That stimulated safe-house buying of the US dollar and selling of the Aussie dollar.' Wall Street was struggling in the final hour of New York trade, with the broader S&amp;P 500 index down 3.82 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was more than three per cent weaker.  Traders returning from the US President's Day holiday also belatedly reacted to a gloomy Group of Seven (G7) statement issued in Rome at the weekend.  The statement, from G7 finance ministers, said the global financial crisis had resulted in a 'severe downturn' that 'is expected to persist through most of 2009'. Mr Richardson said the dollar would be unlikely to fall below $US0.6350 today.  Retail sales data for the December quarter is due to be released at 1130 AEDT, with economists expecting the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures to show a rise of 1 per cent. 'We've seen the Australian economy more resilient than others. That shouldn't provide too much selling pressure,' Mr Richardson said.  Reserve Bank of Australia assistant governor of economics Malcolm Edey is due to address the Committee for Economic Development conference in Sydney this morning.  His comments are not expected to move the dollar as traders take direction from Asian equity markets.
