Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  THE dollar was firmer at noon, as investors gained confidence US authorities would pass President Barack Obama's huge fiscal package.  At 12.00pm (AEDT), the dollar was trading at $US0.6705/06, up from Monday's local close of $US0.6657/62.  During the morning, the local currency traded between $US0.6698 and $US0.6798.  The dollar started the local session higher at $US0.6783/87 at 7.00am, as investor sentiment to risk rose on hopes the US Congress would pass President Obama's fiscal stimulus package, worth about $US827 million ($1.229 billion) this week.  The US Senate voted to end its debate on President Obama's recovery package.  US Senators will move to a final vote on Tuesday (Wednesday AEDT), after which the bill will go through yet another round of negotiations with members of the House of Representatives.  RBC Capital Markets senior currency strategist, Sue Trinh, said the Australian dollar started firmer from the lift in confidence about the possible passage of the US fiscal stimulus package.  But reports of a Russian Association of regional banks re-jigging their loan portfolios with foreign banks had lowered markets' sentiment to risk.  'The dollar has taken a leg lower (this morning) with the rest of the major currencies on news that Russian banks and businesses may be asking foreign banks to reschedule their loans worth $US400 billion,'' Ms Trinh said.  'That has seen risk aversion injected back into a market that had otherwise been rather exuberant for at least the past two days on hopes that the US stimulus package will get passed.''  Ms Trinh said the fall in the National Australia Bank (NAB) monthly business survey's measure of business confidence, down 12 index points in January to minus-32 points, was 'pretty dismal''.  A level below zero indicates that pessimists outnumber optimists.  'Conditions are record lows, which is not helping the Aussie dollar,'' Ms Trinh said.  Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Glenn Stevens will deliver a speech to a conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, at 7.45pm today.  'The market will be breaking down his speech for any insight into the future path of monetary policy,'' Ms Trinh said.  At 12.00pm, the RBA's trade weighted index was at 55.4, up from Monday's close of 55.2.  Meanwhile, the Australian bond market was flat to firmer at noon.  The yield on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was at 4.355 per cent, where it closed on Monday, while the yield on the April 2012 bond was at 3.255 per cent, down from 3.300 per cent.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March 10-year bond futures contract price was 95.670, slightly up from Monday's close of 95.665, while the March three-year bond futures contract price was at 96.740, up from 96.695.
