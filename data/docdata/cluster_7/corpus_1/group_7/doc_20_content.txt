The U.S. dollar weakened against the yen in Asian trade yesterday, weighed down by disappointment over a lack of detail in a U.S. financial sector rescue plan, dealers said.  They said traders in Tokyo were catching up with events in the United States after a Japanese public holiday a day earlier.  The dollar slipped to 89.96 yen in Tokyo afternoon trade from 90.39 in New York late Wednesday.  The euro fell to US$1.2899 from 1.2904 and to 116.03 yen from 116.65.  Markets remained underwhelmed by the U.S. bank rescue package announced by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Tuesday. 'Markets had been buoyed - perhaps excessively - by hope and expectation in the run up to his speech, but were disappointed by the lack of clarity,' said Sumitomo Trust &amp; Banking analyst Saburo Matsumoto.  Traders were now waiting to see whether U.S. President Barack Obama would get Congressional approval for a separate economic stimulus package, he said.  In a hard-fought compromise, U.S. lawmakers agreed Wednesday on US$789.5 billion in tax cuts and spending to pump up the economy. 'The outlook for the U.S. economy remains uncertain and there is still room for possible further stimulus measures,' said Matsumoto. Caution  Caution also grew before Group of Seven finance ministers meet in Rome today and tomorrow, analysts said.  Economic worries pressured the euro after business confidence in the 16-member eurozone plunged to an all-time low in the first quarter, according to the Ifo research institute. 'Because the European Central Bank is very likely to cut its rates at the next policy meeting (in March), many players want to decrease their holdings of the euro,' Nomura Securities dealer Hiroshi Maeba told Dow Jones Newswires.  The ECB kept rates steady at 2.0 percent last week.  Jitters about the Russian economy were also hanging over the euro as European banks have strong exposure to the region, analysts said.  The dollar fell to 11,750 Indonesian rupiah from 11,892 a day earlier, to 1.5076 Singapore dollars from 1.5088 and to 1,392.9 South Korean won from 1,395.4.  At the same time it rose to NT$34.01 from 33.99, to 35.13 Thai baht from 35.02, and to 47.14 Philippine pesos from 47.06.
