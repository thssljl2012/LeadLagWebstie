A prominent economist says the downturn in the Japanese economy isn't likely to hurt Australia's farmers as much as its miners.   Saul Eslake, from the ANZ Bank, says news that Japan's gross domestic product has shrunk to its smallest level in 35 years is indeed a cause for concern  But he says Japan will still need to import agricultural commodities such as beef, seafood and dairy, which will remain relatively strong. 'I'm not sure that the agricultural sector will be hit nearly as hard as the resources sector, and of course that's against the background of the agricultural sector not having benefited to anything like the same extent as the resources sector did during the upside,' he says. 'People do still have to eat.' Mr Eslake says the outlook for coal, iron ore and base metal miners who export to Japan is a bit bleak but he doesn't believe the downturn in Asian economies will be long lived. 'I don't think we're looking at multi year declines in these economies or in the prices of those commodities' he says. 'There's more pain to come in the short term [job losses and mine closures] but a lot of it has already been felt.' Listen to Babs McHugh interview economist Saul Eslake
