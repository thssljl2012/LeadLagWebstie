- 7:24AM Smaller WA businesses are remaining positive in the face of worsening economic conditions - just.  A National Australia Bank survey of small to medium-sized businesses shows firms in WA are losing confidence in the economy fast but the majority still remain keen, leaving the survey's index marginally in positive territory.  However, businesses with annual sales of under $5 million were feeling the heat more than their larger counterparts, with those with sales between $5 million and $10 million strongly positive.  Despite the resources sector turmoil, companies involved in mining were the most positive, while the accommodation, health, business services and transport sectors had more positives than negatives.  Despite a poor last few months of 2008, many companies recorded profits as booked losses.   However, more small businesses believed the profit outlook for 2009 was not bright.  NAB WA business and private banking manager Andrew Whitechurch said that despite the deterioration in overall business conditions, the results were encouraging. 'But it's certainly not a time for complacency and it is concerning that smaller businesses in the state are finding it particularly tough going,' he said.
