 /Commonwealth Bank First Home Buyer Affordability report.   Real estate agents said many young buyers who had given up looking to buy a home could now afford to buy. 'The improvement in housing affordability means those on a more modest income can now contemplate a home of their own,' the HIA's chief executive Chris Lamont said. 'For would-be first-home buyers conditions have improved significantly and clearly many Australians are taking up the opportunity to get into home ownership.' Mr Lamont said lower interest rates have taken 31,158 Victorian households with home loans out of mortgage stress since December 2008, but 126,296 still remain under stress.   The average first home buyer now has to dedicate 19.5 per cent of their income towards mortgage repayments compared to 27.2 per cent in the September quarter. 'Previously a household would have to be earning in the order of $85,000 per annum to afford a modestly priced home without going into severe mortgage stress.' Mr Lamont said. Repayments have fallen even further since the Reserve Bank cut interest rates to a 45-year low earlier this month saving a borrower with a $300,000 loan another $186 a month.   House prices dropped 9.7 per cent last year, according the . Lower interest rates, higher government grants and falling property prices have led to a surge in first home purchases. The  said last week first-home buyers were behind one in four home purchases in December.   The report showed that affordability improved in all capital cities and regional areas.  Real estate agents said many young buyers who had given up looking to buy a home could now afford to buy.
