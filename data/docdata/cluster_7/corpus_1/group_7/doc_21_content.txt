30 workers have lost their jobs at Rio Tinto Alcan's aluminium smelter at Bell Bay in northern Tasmania.  The company is blaming the global economic crisis and a 70 per cent drop in the price of aluminium.  The company says reducing the number of permanent employees and introducing cost saving programs is essential if the Bell Bay smelter is to survive the downturn.  Most of the redundancies are in management and support roles but Rio Tinto Alcan says it will try to redeploy the staff at its other operations.  Economist optimistic  Despite the job losses, ANZ Bank's Chief Economist Saul Eslake says Tasmania won't feel the global economic crisis as badly as other Australian states.  Mr Eslake's told a Committee for Economic Development of Australia conference in Hobart that Tasmania won't be severely affected because it entered the downturn with an unemployment rate below the national average. 'There's been a lot of structural change in Tasmania's economy since the last recession,' Mr Eslake said. 'Tasmania had an above average share of sectors that usually get hammered in a downturn, sectors like mining manufacturing and construction, now those sectors represent a smaller proportion of the Tasmania's economy than the national average.'
