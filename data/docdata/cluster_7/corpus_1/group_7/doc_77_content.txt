WARSAW, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Poland's current account deficit widened to 1.920 billion euros in December from a   downward revised 1.637 billion euros in November, central bank   data showed on Thursday.   The bank's data also showed the trade deficit stood at 1.688   billion euros in December.   ***************************************************************** FORECAST:   Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a   December current account deficit of 2.000 billion euros.   MARKET REACTION:   The Polish zloty and bond yields were   unchanged after the data.   ANALYSTS' COMMENTS:   PIOTR KALISZ, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT CITIBANK HANDLOWY: 'The data is not surprising. It is slightly better than we   expected but close to the market consensus. It is absolutely   neutral for the zloty. 'The deep fall is just a continuation of a trend that   started in October. Falling imports are showing consumption is   weakening, which reflects the sharp (economic) slowdown. 'The current account is likely to improve in the coming   months due to faster falls of imports than exports because of   the weakening zloty.' GRZEGORZ MALISZEWSKI, SENIOR ECONOMIST AT MILLENNIUM 'The data shows the economy is suffering more than expected   from the euro-zone recession. This is reflected in a very deep   fall in exports, which reached 16.4 percent. This is a result of   the worse-than-expected situation in Europe, our main trading partner.' 'It is also worth noting we had a negative balance in   direct foreign investments. We suffered an outflow of FDI in December.'
