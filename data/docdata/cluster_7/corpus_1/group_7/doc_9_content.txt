CANBERRA, Australia - China's economy may have already reached bottom and its emergence as a major industrial power will continue for years, Australia's central bank chief said Friday.  Australia, now teetering on the edge of a recession, has 'plenty of potential' to benefit from China's long-term growth, said Reserve Bank of Australia Gov. Glenn Stevens.  Chinese economic growth had 'slowed down far more than was anticipated' late last year, Stevens told a routine parliamentary inquiry into the Australian economy.'There are some data sets that show something that looks like a bottom,' he said, referring to Chinese economic indicators for January. Reports have shown a rise in bank lending and a slower rate of contraction in manufacturing.  Stevens said it was too early to tell whether the 'tentative indications of a turn for the better in China' would continue.'I think what we've had is a reminder that China is an economy that has business cycles like all of us and it was never going to grow every year at 12 percent,' he said.'It seems to me still the case that the emergence of China as a large industrialized economy has years and years to run,' he said. 'So it will be a volatile ride on occasion as it is today, but I can't believe that the emergence has finished and it seems to me that Australia has plenty of potential to benefit from that over the long run as we did for the last couple of years.'Australia's 17-year run of economic growth before the current slump was tied to burgeoning Chinese and Indian demand for its raw materials such as iron ore, coal and natural gas.  Hopes that a Chinese economic recovery might be taking shape were dampened by figures that showed China's exports plunged 17.5 percent in January amid waning global consumer demand.  Beijing is trying to reduce China's reliance on exports by boosting domestic consumer spending with a 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) stimulus announced in November that is meant to pump money into the economy through higher outlays on highway construction and other public works.
