February 13 - OPEN: The New Zealand dollar slid against the greenback as the United States currency attracted safe-haven bids.  Investors were concerned about global stock market weakness and the effectiveness of US government policies in combating recession.  This tense climate meant the biggest losers among major currencies were the Australian and New Zealand dollars, which pay dividends, said Nick Bennenbroek, head of FX strategy at Wells Fargo in New York.  The Australian dollar was hurt after the Australian Senate just blocked passage of the government's A$42 billion (NZ$53.3 billion) stimulus bill. This is only likely to delay passage not kill it entirely but stimulus payments to households will slip from March toward May, perhaps adding to the case for another sizable rate cut in March.  By 8am the NZ dollar was buying US51.99c from US52.58c at 5pm yesterday. The damage was done by a 1c fall by the kiwi to US51.70c during a two-hour period which started around 9pm.  ANZ bank said that despite attempts to recover ground lost yesterday, NZ dollar moves were thwarted easily by equity falls. A minor recovery took place early morning as the kiwi continued to complete technical moves.  The New Zealand dollar was also lower at today's local open against the Japanese and European currencies, at 0.4052 euro from 0.4076 at 5pm and at 47.03 yen from 47.37.  The kiwi was largely unchanged against the Australian dollar, buying A80.09c at 8am, while the trade weighted index dropped to 52.65 from 53.05 at 5pm.  - NZPA  Next Story: Metlifecare suspends interim dividends
