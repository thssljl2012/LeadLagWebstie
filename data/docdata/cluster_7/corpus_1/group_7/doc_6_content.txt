FOR the newly unemployed, the chance of finding a job advertised in a newspaper or on the internet is becoming less likely by the month.  The number of advertised positions dropped 6.3 per cent in January, an ANZ series published yesterday showed.  On the bank's figures, the number of advertised jobs has fallen 34 per cent in the past year, and the series shows nine months of consecutive decline.  Measures of job ads are considered an early pointer to the state of the labour market and how difficult it is to find a job.  A broader picture will emerge on Thursday with the publication of the Bureau of Statistics' official report into the January labour market.  Although the job market has remained relatively resilient in the face of collapsing consumer and business confidence, the unemployment rate is expected to rise.  The political debate over the Government's $42 billion stimulus package - the Opposition has decried about half of the spending plan as wasteful - stalled yesterday amid concern for the victims of the Victorian bushfires.  But both sides of politics are ready to leap on the labour market figures in support of their views - the Government claiming that a rising unemployment rate demands swift intervention; the Opposition claiming that economic uncertainty underlines the need for prudence.  Job ads fell most on the internet, while newspaper ads rose slightly in January.  The ANZ's head of Australian economics, Warren Hogan, said the small rise in newspaper ads could be 'tentative evidence' that the Federal Government's $10.4 billion spending spree late last year had had a positive impact on the labour market.  But the bank's view is that unemployment will rise from 4.5 per cent to breach 6 per cent this year and peak around 7 per cent next year.  The jobs report on Thursday is expected to show that 18,000 jobs were shed in January, despite the boost provided by Government hand-outs. Continued...
