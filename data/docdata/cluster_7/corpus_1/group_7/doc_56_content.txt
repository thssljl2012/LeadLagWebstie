 IN WASHINGTON  US Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke held out hope yesterday for an end to the recession later this year while Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso called for global confidence in the dollar to stay strong.  As President Barack Obama said that the ''day of reckoning has arrived'' for the country to face head-on the deepening economic crisis, Mr Bernanke told lawmakers he sees a ''reasonable prospect'' for an end to the recession later this year if rescue and stimulus programs work as intended.  But the powerful central bank chief warned in his half yearly address to Congress that a full economic recovery could take two to three years or longer.  The US economy is in the midst of a ''severe contraction'' that has extended into the first quarter of this year, he said.  ''If actions taken by the Administration, the Congress and the Federal Reserve are successful in restoring some measure of financial stability and only if that is the case, in my view there is a reasonable prospect that the current recession will end in 2009 and that 2010 will be a year of recovery,'' Mr Bernanke said.  As he spoke, US consumer confidence plunged more than expected during February amid worsening business conditions and a deteriorating job market while home prices in top US cities fell a record 18.5 per cent in December, new data showed.  ''It is not clear that there is anyone out there who has any confidence left,'' remarked Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers. ''Consumer confidence is now an oxymoron.''  But Mr Obama, in his debut address to a joint session of Congress vowed to make $US2 trillion ($A3.06 trillion) in budget savings within a decade on what he called a new ''day of reckoning'' for the US economy.  He demanded budget sacrifices from both Republicans and Democrats and pledged to act ''boldly and wisely'' to revive the economy.  He has also met Mr Aso and both agreed the dollar must remain the world's key currency despite the US-bred economic crisis, Mr Aso said after their talks in Washington.
