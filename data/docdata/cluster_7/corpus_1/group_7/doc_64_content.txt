COLOMBO, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka's inflation,   as measured on a 12-month moving average, is expected to ease in   February for a fourth straight month due to the impact of price   drops in fuel, electricity, transport and food.   The median forecast of eight analysts predicted the 12-month   moving average had slowed to a nine-month low of 20.50 percent in   February. It hit a 6-year high of 23.4 percent in October.   From a year earlier, consumer prices are expected to have   risen 9.00 percent, the weakest annual rise since April 2006 and   its first single-digit value since July 2006, easing from 10.7   percent in January.   This measure of inflation hit a six-year high of 28.2 percent   in June and has fallen for seven straight months through January.   'The full impact of price reductions in fuel, transport,   electricity and LP gas would be seen in this month's inflation,'   said Danushka Samarasinghe, head of research at Asia Securities.   The government has reduced the prices of fuel and gas, though   not in line with sharply fallen global oil prices. It also   reduced public transport fares and electricity tariffs.   Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal has said annual   inflation should ease to around 8 percent in February and then   around 5 percent by end 2009.   Sri Lanka's monetary programme for this year is based on   growth of 5.0-6.0 percent and annual inflation of around 9   percent, the central bank has said.   The central bank, which targets reserve money to keep   inflation down, has said that strategy had worked.   The Census and Statistics Department introduced a new   inflation index formally in December 2007, with 2002 as the base   year, saying the old measure did not reflect the consumption   pattern of households.
