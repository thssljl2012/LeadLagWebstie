Credit card and personal loan applications have taken a dive despite a series of aggressive interest rate cuts, data from Australia's biggest consumer check agency shows. Credit requests fell by 14.9 per cent in the year to January, Veda Advantage said on Tuesday. Credit applications have declined on an annual basis for four consecutive months, and the drop in January follows a seven per cent fall in the year to December. Australian Bureau of Statistics lending finance data this week showed the value of personal loans fell by an annual pace of 13 per cent in December. Veda commands about 80 per cent of the consumer credit check market and provides credit history information to lenders. The drop in credit applications coincided with interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia in October, November and December that took the cash rate to a six and a half-year low of 4.25 per cent. The data was compiled before the RBA slashed interest rates in February by 100 basis points to a 45-year low of 3.25 per cent. Veda said credit inquiries in the December quarter of 2008 were down 9.1 per cent, or 149,000, compared with the same period in 2007, but they did not say how many credit applications were received. Personal loan applications fell by 15 per cent, or 105,000, when the final quarters of 2007 and 2008 were compared, which Veda said was the biggest drop since 2004. Veda Advantage chief executive Rory Matthews said Australians were more wary about taking on more debt. 'Australians remain wary of taking on more debt in this market, and our default data shows that 2008 was a difficult year for consumers with defaults rising throughout the year,' he said.
