The gain in real sales adjusted for inflation was smaller than the median forecast of a 1.1% increase, largely because prices rose by more than expected.  Analysts were disappointed by the small rise.  Nomura economist Stephen Roberts called it a 'soft result'. 'It's quite modest when you consider the amount of stimulus that was there in the pre-Christmas period,'' Mr Roberts said. 'The combination of poor data from overseas and on balance softish data suggests another rate cut in March, even if it's a small one of at least 50 basis points.''  TD Securities senior strategist Joshua Williamson said the numbers were weaker than expected and showed that although the economic stimulus package provided increasing sales in December, it is not likely to be translating into increasing sales in first quarter 2009. 'Global developments will guide further interest rate cuts. I am expecting a 75-basis-point cut in March,'' he said.  The Australian dollar eased slightly after the data. Bond futures remained sharply higher as worries over earu zone banks and the global economic outlook dominated.  Investors are pricing in a rate cut of at least 50 basis points from the Reserve Bank of Australia in March.  Retail sales account for around 23% of Australia's GDP and the sector is the biggest employer with about 15% of all jobs.  Sharp cuts in interest rates, falling petrol prices and a $10.4 billion government stimulus package all contributed to spending power in the quarter.  Yet consumer confidence was fragile as a tide of gloomy news abroad and talk of recession at home led households to bump up their savings and pay off debt.  A rise in sales in line with forecasts would suggest private consumption made a vital contribution to economic growth last quarter, perhaps helping avoid a negative GDP result.  However, consumer confidence has slid further this quarter despite 100 basis points of rate cuts and the announcement of a $42 billion spending package by the government.
