CANBERRA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - The Australian government decision to guarantee bank wholesale funding had worked very well, Australia's central bank said on Friday. 'It has made the banks very confident of their funding, so it has allowed them to continue lending to customers,' Reserve Bank of Australia Deputy Governor Ric Battellino said in testimony to parliament.
