Australia may get lucky and avoid a recession in 2009, although some analysts say possible further downgrades of state sovereign credit ratings could affect confidence in the broader economy.  The world's premier economies of the US, Japan and Germany are already in recession, along with 11 other industrialised countries that contracted last year.  But CommSec chief economist Craig James says Australia could enjoy its eighteenth consecutive year of growth as big interest rate cuts and federal government stimulus programs support the economy.  'While the global downturn is far bigger than the 2001 slowdown, it is not out of the question that Australia could avoid recession yet again,' Mr James said.  'No other country has received the same economic boost from all three factors - government spending, lower interest rates and a cheaper Aussie dollar.  'But whether meeting the technical definition of recession or not, the economy faces significant challenges over 2009.'  The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut interest rates by 400 basis points since September, taking the cash rate to a 45 year low of 3.25 per cent.  The federal government also unveiled two economic stimulus programs, worth a combined $52 billion, to boost infrastructure and consumer spending.  However, ICAP senior economist Adam Carr said the downgrade of Queensland's credit rating to AA-plus, from AAA, by Standard &amp; Poor's last week was likely to affect the view investors took of Australian state governments trying to raise debt finance.  '(There is a) good chance that it will be followed by more downgrades for other states,' he said.  'It's at least got to increase that likelihood.'  Until recently, Queensland was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the commodities boom but now it joins Tasmania as the only other state not to have a AAA rating.  Analysts expect NSW also eventually to have its credit rating downgraded because of its negative outlook. Continued...
