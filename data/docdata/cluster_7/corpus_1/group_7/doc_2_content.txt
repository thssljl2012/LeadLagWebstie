2113 GMT [Dow Jones] Australian government bond prices likely to come under some pressure in Asia session. Concerns about massive additional supply depressed U.S. Treasurys overnight and mood likely to flow into local trade. Tony Morriss, debt strategist at ANZ Bank, says some of the key leading indicators of global demand such as the Baltic Dry Index starting to look more upbeat, which is also weighing on Treasurys. Local focus is on a speech by RBA Governor Glenn Stevens later today. Few expectations that he will add to the significant commentary published last week. Prevailing view is that the RBA is approaching the end of its easing cycle, having slashed rates by 400 basis points since September. Australian 3-year bonds closed overnight 96.65, down 4.5 bps.
