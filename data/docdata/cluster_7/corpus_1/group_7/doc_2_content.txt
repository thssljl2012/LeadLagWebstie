The Australian dollar was marginally higher at noon as reports the Obama administration is planning to help US mortgage holders lifted sentiment for risk-sensitive assets. At 1200 AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6544/50, up from Thursday's close of $US0.6537/41. During the morning, the currency moved between $US0.6440 and $US0.6573. The Australian dollar started the local session near its intra-day low of $US0.6440 before news that US President Barack Obama's administration could emerge with a plan to ease the pains of homebuyers facing mortgage foreclosures, television reports said. Once reports of a possible plan appeared, US equities recovered most of their intra-day losses in the last hour of trade. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen nearly 250 points in earlier trading, but closed down just 6.77 points, or by 0.09 per cent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.73 per cent and the broad Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was up 0.17 per cent. Societe Generale chief foreign exchange dealer, Paul Milton, said news of the US package lifted market sentiment and the Australian dollar rose in tow. 'In the last hour of New York, (the Australian dollar) recovered most of its overnight losses on the back of the Obama package to help the mortgage belt in the US,' Mr Milton said. 'The Dow basically recovered around 250 points: it was down 250 and came back to flat on the news. 'The Aussie was basically bought on the back of that.' Mr Milton said the local currency had been sold in Thursday's offshore session on increased doubts about the federal government's $42 billion fiscal package. On Thursday, the South Australian independent senator Nick Xenophon voted with the coalition to reject the Nation Building and Jobs plan. 'There was quite a lot of negative sentiment over the last 24 hours ... doubt of the Rudd rescue package, and the uncertainty about that,' he said. The currency spiked, however, after reports near 1100 AEDT on Friday that Senator Xenophon had reached agreement with the government and would vote for the stimulus package. Mr Milton said the Australian dollar could test $US0.6600 during the rest of the Asian session. At 1200 AEDT, the Reserve Bank of Australia's trade weighted index was at 54.3, down from Thursday's close of 54.4. Meanwhile, the Australian bond market was flat to weaker at noon. At 1200 AEDT, the yield on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was 4.185, down from Thursday's close of 4.188 per cent, while the yield on the April 2012 bond was at 3.105 per cent, up from 3.050 per cent. On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March 10-year bond futures contract price was 95.845, down from Thursday's close of 95.850, while the March three-year bond futures contract price was at 96.900, down from 96.955.
