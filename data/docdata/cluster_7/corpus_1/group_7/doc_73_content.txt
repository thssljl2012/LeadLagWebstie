COMMENT: PIOTR KALISZ, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT CITIBANK HANDLOWY IN WARSAW 'A relatively large fall in industrial output shows that in the first quarter economic growth will probably slow to 2 percent or even below that level.' 'This data also confirms that the slowdown is connected with the slump in exports which can be seen in the manufacturing sector.' 'In our opinion, despite this data, the MPC will leave rates unchanged for fear of excessive zloty weakening.'
