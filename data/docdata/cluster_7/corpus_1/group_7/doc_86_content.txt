Big interest rate cuts and the boost in first home buyer grants will take at least another year to spark a recovery in home building, the nation's peak residential construction group says.  The Housing Industry Association (HIA) predicts that housing starts will decline this financial year before growing again in 2009/10 and 2010/11.  HIA chief economist Harley Dale said rate cuts since September and the increase in the first home buyers' grant, as part of the federal government's earlier $10.4 billion economic stimulus package, would start helping the home building sector during the next financial year. 'The first home owners' boost, mortgage rates at a 40-year low, and the housing components of the federal government's national building and jobs plan have the capacity to deliver a moderate recovery in residential activity,' Dr Dale said. Housing starts were forecast to fall by 17 per cent in 2008/09 to 132,190, the HIA's national outlook report for the December quarter of 2008 said. 'Current housing conditions remain, notwithstanding some spark from the first home buyer market,' Dr Dale said. The report predicted housing starts would grow by 13 per cent in 2009/10 and by a further six per cent in 2010/11 to reach 158,100 projects.  The federal government's earlier fiscal stimulus package, unveiled in October, doubled the first home buyer subsidy for established dwellings to $14,000 and tripled it to $21,000 for newly built homes.  The subsidy boost is due to be phased out mid-year.  The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has slashed interest rates by 400 basis points since September, taking the cash rate to a 45-year low of 3.25 per cent.  RBA governor Glenn Stevens told a parliamentary hearing on Friday he expected recent rate cuts to help the construction industry. 'For ordinary people looking in lower-price areas, (lower) interest rates have improved things a lot from the housing affordability point of view,' Mr Stevens told the House of Representatives Economics Committee in Canberra. 'I think you'll see the effects of that on housing finance and housing construction in the next couple of years.'
