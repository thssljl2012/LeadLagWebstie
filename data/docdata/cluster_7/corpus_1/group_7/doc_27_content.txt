SYDNEY, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Australian business investment rose strongly last quarter, defying predictions of a slump and despite weak global demand and sliding commodity prices, greatly lessening the risk of an outright contraction in the economy. However, Thursday's data also showed firms cut back on formerly upbeat spending plans for all of 2008/09 and were predicting little or no spending growth in 2009/10. **************************************************************** KEY POINTS: * Q4 real private sector capital expenditure +6.0 pct q/q, seasonally adjusted (median forecast -3.3 pct) * Q4 building investment +11.5 pct, plant/machinery +1.0 pct * 5th estimate for 2008/09 capex A$98.15 bln, down 4.4 pct on the fourth estimate * 1st estimate for 2009/10 capex A$79.87 bln, up 0.6 pct on the first estimate for 2008/09 * For brief table click on: COMMENTARY: RORY ROBERTSON, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, MACQUARIE 'The rise in plant and equipment offers hope that GDP will show a small rise rather than a negative reading. But further out its clear businesses are paring back their spending plans, and that process is just warming up. With equity market at new lows and the world enveloped in doom and gloom, spending is almost certain to be cut back further.' HELEN KEVANS, ECONOMIST, ANZ 'We expect capital expenditure to be significantly reigned in going forward. The RBA will definitely take this into consideration and at the moment we forecast a 50 basis point rate cut next week, that said it will be a very close call. The number did effect our GDP forecast. We had a flat GDP for Q4 but we do have a lot more data that's going to influence that number over the next few days.' STEPHEN ROBERTS, ECONOMIST, NOMURA 'The pretty strong set of numbers implies a positive GDP reading. The first estimate for 2009/10 is soft but not as soft as many would have thought. The Reserve Bank of Australia is likely to cut rates in March but it will probably be a small cut of 25 to 50 basis points. The RBA will still be oriented towards the impact of overseas events. There seems to be a lag running but realistically it can't continue for very much longer.' JOSHUA WILLIAMSON, TD SECURITIES, SENIOR STRATEGIST 'Business investments went against expectations and this suggests upside risks to GDP of 0.1 percent. This means that business investments have yet to react to the crisis. This poses some risks of a reduced interest rate cut next week, and even the possibility that the central bank will keep rates on hold. But I still think that business investments overall will fall about 20 percent this year given persistent weakness in the trade-exposed sectors.' PAUL BRENNAN, CO-HEAD OF MARKET ECONOMICS, CITI 'The headline figure is a little misleading because only the equipment figure goes into GDP, and that's 1 percent against the headline rise of 6 percent. That's still a good result considering what's been happening with business confidence and the tightening of financial conditions. The figures suggest that things remain relatively resilient on the corporate capex side, but looking ahead the capex plans are being cut back and that's not surprising. For the Reserve Bank of Australia, I don't think they'd be wanting to cut interest rates at the moment, I think they've done enough.' MARKET REACTION: - The Australian dollar firmed on the data. Bill futures sold off as the data were taken as lessening the chance of a further cut in interest rates at the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) policy meeting next week.
