CANBERRA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank still has more interest rate ammunition to use if needed to protect the economy from the global downturn, Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens said on Friday.   In just six months the central bank has cut its key cash rate by 4 percentage points to a record low of 3.25 percent, by far the most aggressive easing since a recession in the early 1990s.
