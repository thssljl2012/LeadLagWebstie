 (RTTNews) - During early Asian deals on Tuesday, the Australian dollar declined to new multi-day lows against the US dollar, the Japanese yen and the Canadian currency. On the other hand, the Aussie edged higher versus the European currency.  The Reserve Bank of Australia's board members believed that any economic stimulus would have little effect in the short term but could spur growth later in 2009, minutes from the board's February 3 monetary policy meeting revealed today.  At the meeting, the RBA reduced the nation's benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points to 3.25 percent, taking the rate down to its lowest value since 1964.  Government data showed Australia's economy grew by just 0.1 percent in the third quarter of 2008, and is believed by many analysts to have slipped into recession in Q4. The RBA board members optimistically predict a flat reading, the minutes showed.  Against the US dollar, the Australian currency edged down during early Asian deals on Tuesday. At 9:50 pm ET, the aussie-dollar pair touched a 5-day low of 0.6447, compared to 0.6506 hit late New York Monday. If the pair falls further, 0.634 is seen as the next target level.  The Australian dollar that closed Monday's North American session at 1.9689 against the European currency showed strength during today's early Asian deals.

An index measuring activity in Japan's service industry was lower by a seasonally adjusted 1.6 percent in December compared to the previous month, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said today, posting a score of 106.0.
