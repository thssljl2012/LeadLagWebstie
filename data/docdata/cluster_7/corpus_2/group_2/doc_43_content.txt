         Apologies if Im reporting old news, Bloomberg are reporting that Barclays need to raise another 7.5 Billion according to RBS analyst Ian Smillie :   http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601208&amp;amp;amp;sid=afN.uSZ4...   I recall a post describing a 1980s funding problem for UK banks which suggested that this time would be just like the last, most players would have to go back to the well several times.
