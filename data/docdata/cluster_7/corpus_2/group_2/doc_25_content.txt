That&amp;#039;s just me                      I presume you meant CDS. The shorts are buying CDS to spread fear about MS/GS.    Barclays will hopefully guarantee LEH&amp;#039;s trades. But there is a long way to go before we get there. Right now LEH&amp;#039;s commercial (non-financial) counterparties are shopping their contracts around with other broker-dealers.
