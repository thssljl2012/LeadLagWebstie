 Barclays Stockbrokers are displaying this announcement:  Important Information in trading of Exchange Traded Commodities (ETCs) Please be aware that following an LSE announcement a number of ETCs have been placed into an ongoing auction period and, as a result, are not available for trading. This is a market wide issue. Should you be placing an order online for an ETC, please ensure you monitor the status of your order as affected ETCs will be rejected as pricing is not currently available.
