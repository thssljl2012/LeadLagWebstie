           I keep watching the hit count go up on this thread, but nobody is posting anything.        Come-out, come-out whoever you are...    You have something to add to this discussion.... and we want to hear it...        Seriously... even if you don&amp;#039;t want to add something to the subject, you can comment on something you learned or did not know previously.      As for the issue with Lehman Brothers...    Euro jumps against dollar as Lehman Brothers falls bankrupt       &amp;amp;quot;The euro raced higher against the dollar on Monday, before cooling, as foreign exchange dealers reacted to the US financial crisis, following the collapse of investment giant Lehman Brothers. The European single currency had soared to 1.4481 dollars in Asian trading from 1.4229 dollars late in New York on Friday.&amp;amp;quot;         Some info on Lehman...

One thing for sure... you all better start watching your accounts - both investment and checking/savings, but especially the institutional investments. You are covered by the FDIC up to $100k on your daily accounts, but your 401Ks, Roths, and IRas are NOT INSURED. When these funds go broke... so do you.     Just ask those that worked at Enron.
