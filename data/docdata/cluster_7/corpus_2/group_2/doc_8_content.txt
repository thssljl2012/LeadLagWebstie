 The Reserve Bank of Australia is  lending the US Fed US$10 billion  to help fund the contemplated bail-out of US mortgage holders. I can&amp;#039;t really think that that is a wise investment of our stabilisation fund. When I recollect the climax of my career as a public servant in Australia was being unable to get a lousy A$1.1 billion for a collection of rail upgrades that had a BCR of 12.7, I positively weep.
