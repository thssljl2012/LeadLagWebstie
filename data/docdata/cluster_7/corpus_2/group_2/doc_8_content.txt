If I were Doyle, I would buy heavily tomorrow if POT takes a dive, may be a great opportunity for them to buy shares cheap.       f LEH is gone and MER is acquired at a premium, short-sellers will lose targets. I think people were shorting LEH/MER and hedging with BAC/JPM, etc. that&amp;#039;s why SKF was not soaring. But if shorts in brokers are unwinded, BAC/JPM may fall too or may not go up as much.      I believe in the fundamentals of my stocks, but I don&amp;#039;t want the broad market to crater. In an earlier post, I said how fertilizers, coal, energy stocks have become highly correlated. Hopefully correlation will drop and fundamentals will re-assert once systemic risk is perceived to be falling.      &amp;amp;nbsp;Fed is encouraging BAC to buy MER, they should encourage others to buy S&amp;amp;amp;P futures            thread start
