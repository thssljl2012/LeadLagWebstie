For quite some time on most of the threads , most of the talk has been about Ebays ever changing &amp;quot; policies &amp;quot;...Much has been said about quitting and moving on , emailing ebay and complaining, ect......I have tried this for a few weeks and have not found another site where the grass is Greener yet ,unfortunatly..I&amp;#039;m still not ready to start re-listing tho...I have been following Ebay stock on    http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=EBAY#chart1:symbol=ebay;range=6m;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined   You will have to copy and Paste the above   There is a LOT of information here if you look around , Major investors in Ebay for Starters....Ebay is pretty much owned by 5 Major Direct Holders ( 3 Directly involved with Ebay ) And Many large Institutional and Mutual Fund Holders..Once you are on the site ,If you click on the 2nd persons name , its very interesting how many purchases and sales of stock took place in a 2 year period..She made a LOT of $$$$$ in a short period of time..almost seems illegal ?..Anyway my point is that many institutions that manage many of out retirement funds and 501K&amp;#039;s have stock in Ebay ( Im with Morgan Stanley )...I for 1 am going to call my guy and ask him to NOT invest my money in ebay stock  from now on ( Its dropped $18 a share in less than a year anyway )........I don&amp;#039;t know if this will help open their eyes in any way or if any of you even care but i had to share this interesting information......
