         &amp;amp;quot;Is this money now gone given the Lehman Brothers collapse?&amp;amp;quot;   The bankruptcy court will decide who gets what remaining assets.  Some of Lehman&amp;#039;s debt business is being offered to Barclays.  I think that includes the Asset Backed Securities business where Lehman&amp;#039;s collects interest on bonds and then redistributes those funds to owners of its trust preferred stocks as &amp;amp;quot;dividends.&amp;amp;quot;  It is hard to know if your bond is included in that package or not.     &amp;amp;quot;Where do corporate bonds fall in the hierarchy of creditors during a liquidation?&amp;amp;quot;  Owners of Lehman&amp;#039;s common stock have probably lost everything.  They will be lucky to get even pennies on the dollar in payment.  Preferred stock holders are usually second.  Bond holders are usually third, but it depends on what assets if any are pledged to support the bond.  The word &amp;amp;quot;lein&amp;amp;quot; suggests there are some.  So it could depend on the quality of those assets.  Bottom line is no one knows for sure at this point, but stay tuned.  You will know one of these days.  If your bond is traded on an exchange, the market price will tell you if other investors are worried or confident.  If traded over the counter, you probably won&amp;#039;t be able to know.  But Goldman Sachs can probably get you an offer to sell the bond.  I would guess you will be lucky to get half of face value if you sell now.  I would wait to next interest payment date and see if you get paid.  If yes, hold.  If not, sell.   QuantumOnLine.com  is a great source of information on fixed income securities.  If your bond is not listed there, you can probably find other Lehman&amp;#039;s bonds.  If you then look at charts by ticker symbol, you will get  a quick glimpse of what others are doing with which of the Lehman debt issues.
