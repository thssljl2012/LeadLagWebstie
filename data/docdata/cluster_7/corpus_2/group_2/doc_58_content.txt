          The truth is that LLOY shareholders have been stiffed. BARC and LLOY will be the 2 weakest UK bank shares for the foreseeable future.   Gorging on such a huge takeover is value destroying for the existing shareholders ... just ask RBS shareholders who held shares prior to its purchase of ABN Amro. And exposure to the UK mortage market is not exactly what one would want.   Only time will tell who will be the winner in all of this. Lloyds + HBOS, Barclays + Lehman, RBS + ABN Amro. Currently size and diversity is strength (fingers crossed). I don&amp;#039;t see Barclays as weak. They are my number 2 behind HSBC.  You also should remember that at the half year HBOS had more than 20bn in capital and reserves.
