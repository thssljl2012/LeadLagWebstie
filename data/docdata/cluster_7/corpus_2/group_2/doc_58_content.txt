The term &amp;quot;death-spiral-financing&amp;quot; would seem to have more emphasis  today. Nasdaq.com has a great link for viewing Institutional  Holdings.       http://www.nasdaq.com/asp/holdings.asp?symbol=AOB&amp;amp;amp;selected=AOB&amp;amp;amp;FormType=Institutional       In my focus mainly on the china r/m scam sector I see the same  players in every uplisted china stock, Merrill Lynch, Lehman  Brothers, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Barclays, etc.  most all hold substantial positions. These carnivores are already  showing signs of cannibalism.      For the smaller (death-spiral) outfits taking these outrageous  underwriting fees and toxic paper options/warrants - the Roths,  Popes, etc. - it&amp;#039;s just a matter of time before they all run for  the exits too.
