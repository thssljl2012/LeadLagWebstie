Yes, but the mortages, and deposits they hold, don&amp;#039;t actually belong to them in any real sense. The deposits belong to the depositors, and the mortage assets only belong to them if the debtor fails keep up payments, on the outstanding loan, and they take the property back, in a repossession.   They will also hold similar but more complicated securities, bonds or loans, which pay them intrest. Many of which will be worth a great deal less than their national value.      What they &amp;#039;own&amp;#039;, is the future revenues that accrue as a result of holding these mortgages, and securities, and other loans, As well as the physical infrastructure, intellectual property, goodwill, and so on. (See Below)     When Lehman Bros went down the bulk of the assets boiled down to some prime new york real estate, and certain &amp;#039;star&amp;#039; investment teams, which Barclays and Nomura are in the process of buying.

Does this mean that another bank could buy them for 263 million.                         Yes          Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  JoanWitness                         Bradford &amp;amp;amp; Bingley.     If they went bust how much would the Government have to pump in to save them. It cost the Government 25 Billion to bail out Northern Rock.                            (See above) The vast bulk of their assset holdings will have been used as collateral for their own borrowing. In B&amp;amp;amp;B&amp;#039;s case this is large.     The cost of the bail out will depend on how much they owe (lots) set against how much they are worth, (not a lot)     It&amp;#039;s similar to stories you read of companies being sold for a pound.     This pound normally entitles you to call the companies assets your own. But also saddles you with it&amp;#039;s debt. Normally much larger than the asset base.
