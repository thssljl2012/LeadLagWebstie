BAC share is trading @ 28.19 (-16%) and ML                         shares are trading at 20.13 (+18.30%).                           For .8595 shares, ML shares should be worth 24.23 USD. The price                         difference of 4.10 shows that this deal is not 100% confirmed or                         there are other issues which is hindering ML from closing this 4.10                         USD gap.                           Anyway, the Bloomberg report is outdated and I would estimate                         that at USD 24.23 ( the full realized value). Temasek would have                         lost already 4.77 USD on each share .. or the deal is now only                         worth 42 billion instead of the initial 50 billion. So the stake is                         almost at break even point. Also, one would have to consider                         whether BAC will continue to appreciate in value. Do remember they                         have now absorbed ML&amp;#039;s balance sheet and alall the toxic asset and                         it&amp;#039;s going to be a negative effect on BAC&amp;#039;s stock price.                         Eventually, the share price of BAC will fall further ( I won&amp;#039;t                         expect it to start rising anytime soon). So Temasek is still                         possible to make a loss..&amp;amp;nbsp;                           Why would a SWF invest in something so risky? It&amp;#039;s really lucky                         that Temasek didn&amp;#039;t lose her pants in this investment, but it would                         be daft to claim that this is an astute investment. Temasek should                         be contented with a small loss in ML instead of the original 20-30%                         loss before being bought out by BAC today. And to say that Temasek                         made a strategic move to bail out all these banks for the greater                         good of the global economy is too far fetched.. Temasek has at most                         200 billion of assets and can only mobilize at most 20-30% of it.                         50-60 billion is not enough to recapitalize even one of the big                         banks&amp;#039; writedowns and future potential losses..                           I would just say it&amp;#039;s a bad investment right from the start and                         it&amp;#039;s lucky that Temasek is getting bailed out at the moment by BAC.                         But to even have to risk a 1% chance of bankruptcy (i.e like                         Lehman&amp;#039;s) is already too risky for a SWF whose main aim is to                         ensure capital preservation.                           &amp;amp;nbsp;                           &amp;amp;nbsp;                           &amp;amp;nbsp;                           &amp;amp;nbsp;                           &amp;amp;nbsp;                           &amp;amp;nbsp;                           &amp;amp;nbsp;                           &amp;amp;nbsp;                           &amp;amp;nbsp;                           &amp;amp;nbsp;                           &amp;amp;nbsp;                                                                               well, Temasek Holdings maybe can&amp;#039;t re-cap a big bank&amp;#039;s                         writedowns...                           but what it can do is give itself some time to exit itself from                         its other investments... and re-adjust its portfolio to ride out                         the coming recession...                           if ML was to fail at that point, market pressure would probably                         have caused Bear Stearns, Lehmans, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and god                         knows who else to go bankrupt much faster than the economy could                         handle... AIG would probably have gone down much earlier rather                         than now... And would Citigroup and Barclays have survived the                         bloodletting ??                           btw, AIG failing would probably have a much greater impact than                         ML, Lehman or Bear Stearns.... my guess is that anyone who has                         their entire insurance portfolio with AIG would probably find it                         worthless if AIG were to file for Chapter 11...                           the one year respite gave a lot of other banks the chance to                         consolidate their holdings and to cut back their losses... it gave                         time for the Fed to organise its resources and organise deals to                         keep as much business afloat, either thru re-cap or thru                         merger...                           now we have a gradual slide into recession(maybe), but if ML was                         to fail at that time, the world&amp;#039;s economy would probably have fell                         into recession much faster...                           &amp;amp;nbsp;                           this might not have been Temasek&amp;#039;s aim, it could have been pure                         dumb luck.. but this may have played a part in saving many people&amp;#039;s                         asses...
