I agree about the borrowing too much, but it seems like there&amp;#039;s a great deal of bad paper floating around, in other words, lending institutions handed out money to make people homeowners and such, who really, honestly couldn&amp;#039;t afford it. as an insurance company, I don&amp;#039;t understand AIG&amp;#039;s pre-bankruptcy claim, or their losses. what losses? from claimants, or, bad investments?                      Leverage. When a bank, insurance company or brokerage borrows money at 4% then puts it to work at 7% they make money. 3% money on their cash flow in this over simplified example. As long as the money supply costs stay below the return on lending there is a profit. But markets are fluid and ever changing. And top that off with the fact that mortgage paper is for 30 years most of the time, and you&amp;#039;ve got a recipe for trouble. Forget what kind of business it is. That matters but a little. We&amp;#039;ll just call &amp;#039;em banks, because they all deal in large sums of money.     When a bank puts out lots of paper at 7% and is borrowing at 4%, if that 4% goes to 5% they want to get rid of the 7% paper and try to let more out at 8%. But first, they have to get shed of the 7%. Normally there are plenty of investors willing to buy paper with a 7% return. The stability of the paper&amp;#039;s value would not be questioned as long as the mortgage holder was making payments on time and the underlying asset that backs the mortgage is worth more than the actual mortgage.     However, when in the middle of the game someone changes the rules, the value of the 7% paper gets dicier. Before the rule change, the entry price of the note was carried as its underlying asset value to the exit of the note. After the rule change, the institutions have to re evaluate on a quarterly basis and consider the current disposal value as the real value. As long as the markets behave in similar fashion to that of the past, steadily increasing in value, the paper is still good. Get a market bubble and retraction, and investors question the safety of their money with only a 7% return. In other words, it gets harder to sell the paper.     It is important for the bank to be able to sell its paper too, because a lot of the money made on these loans is from the up front fees paid for the origination of the loans. Now consider what happens when the investors refuse to touch the paper, because it&amp;#039;s not clear what the value is. For the bank to meet their obligations, they may be put in the position of having to sell these notes for less than what it costs them to originate them. Hence, the loss.     When the government gets these notes for a deep discount to their previous entry value in bulk, around 95% of the notes are still performing. The bank is distressed, so they are selling to raise cash, but most of the cash flow is still intact. And, when the market improves, the underlying asset will grow in value back to (or close to) its original value.
