 UPL Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Re: Barclays: Gas Supply to Outrun Demand Through 2010/nrg_guru   &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;   YOY NG production declines average 40%, as Aubrey McClendon of CHK likes to point out. This means that 40% of all production must be replaced each and every year. If the price of NG is too low then many producers will curtail drilling. This off course ultimately leads to higher NG prices and then higher production. Aubrey McClendon thinks that the price point for balance is about $8. So your point about replacing production by producers is true as long as prices remain high enough.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    I&amp;#039;m not sure if $8 is the magic number but I believe there are plays that require high $7 and maybe $8 NG to be profitable. For UPL the price is among the lowest ($4.85, breakeven at 10% ROR). Not sure what the economics across all the plays are (and these are constantly changing) but there is a feedback loop of sorts which will keep prices high, possibly at least $8 and if they go higher, UPL probably should hedge...&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Totally agree - I am a believer of the self-correcting thesis.&amp;amp;nbsp; We can all debate the price, but I do think that above $7-8 and we will see too much supply and below those levels for a sustained period we will start to see the self-correction.&amp;amp;nbsp; Problem in near-term is lots of companies hedged at recent high prices (XTO just added a bunch more hedges through 2010; CHK is 60% hedged in &amp;#039;09; BBG - just because I know - is 75% hedged in &amp;#039;09 and 50% hedged in 2010, based on &amp;#039;08E volumes), so if the price response is delayed, together with unfavorable weather and weak demand due to economic malaise (does anyone really believe the 3.3% GDP number), supply could get out of whack.&amp;amp;nbsp; I do not know what the exact amount of storage is these days, but a number of new storage facilities have been come online recently, so we probably could store 3.7-3.8 Tcf, not to mention filling pipes up to max allowable pressure.&amp;amp;nbsp; Take a look at a price chart for NG over last 3-4 years.&amp;amp;nbsp; Take away&amp;amp;nbsp;the recent spike and the &amp;#039;05 spike and the price has been pretty consistently in the $6-8 range and I would point out we were in the $4&amp;#039;s just two years ago around this time.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;Costs have moved up, so&amp;amp;nbsp;given the growth we&amp;#039;ve seen in that 6-8 context, I think maybe the new range for similar growth is $6.50-8.50.&amp;amp;nbsp;     &amp;amp;nbsp;    60 Bcf/d+, figure you lose 35-40% each year, so have to replace 24 Bcf/d just to stay flat.&amp;amp;nbsp; 1600+ gas rigs currently.&amp;amp;nbsp; Figure 25 day cycle time on average and if you&amp;#039;ll drill around 24k wells, which would have to average 1 MMcf/d each to achieve that replacement.&amp;amp;nbsp;          thread start
