Now keeping that thought aside,  would like to see some critical discussions and a deep dive on some below topics from financial gurus in this forum    - the current deleveraging that is going on  - how long one thinks this recession is gonna last  - ramifications on other sectors (not indian IT, everyone knows that)  - value of the dollar and role of the fed    IMO, I dont see any value putting money in the market when we might be looking at a sluggish market for a foreseeable future, would rather use that somewhere else. Is Warren Buffet buying by the way?                      As for de-leveraging and its effect - the effect is easy to guess isn&amp;#039;t it? The asset prices will come down.    As for how long this recession is going to last - well, officially, the recession still hasn&amp;#039;t begun in the US. Remember, it still has positive economic output. So, the economy is still expanding and hence, not under recession.    As for ramifications on other sectors - We can assume that the growth of all those companies and sectors that rely on debt to fund their plans will be affected. If they relied on capital markets for funds, then it depends on the investor mood for the sector, which right now seems to be ubiquitously bearish.    Value of the dollar, and the role of the fed - the former is in the down trend looking at the burgeoning account and trade deficits. It remains to be seen how the bailouts of about 400B given thus far by the feds to Wall street will be funded. If it would be funded by printing more currency notes, the increase in supply will further take the USD down. The downward pressure on oil prices is also pulling the USD down. As for the role of the fed, I think fed will cease to limit itself to the role of a central banker, and will become into this giant financial corp with interests in housing (FNM, FRE), and insurance (AIG).    Disclaimer - Not a financial guru by any means, in fact, I don&amp;#039;t think I am even a sincere student of financial markets. However, I do care to understand economics.    Regards,  R2I4C.
