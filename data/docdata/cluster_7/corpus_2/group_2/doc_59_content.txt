What would that number look like if just homeowners were bailed out?  How many of the 301,000,000 are homeowners?  Homeowners are the ones feeling the pinch of rising property taxes, rising insurance costs, making those monthly payments to AIG for PMI, and rising ARM loans they can&amp;#039;t re-fi because of the credit crunch.  So if 770,000,000,000 or even the $85,000,000,000 were distributed to just homeowners, to pay off their mortgages, etc...I don&amp;#039;t buy the argument that the cost of goods and services would then soar with all this influx of cash, because that cash would go straight back into the banks, making them cash heavy again by people paying off some of these bad loans and rising credit card debt.  Banks would now have cash to lend again, a whole new wave of homeowners and investors would buy up all the distressed properties and credit crunch is fixed.
