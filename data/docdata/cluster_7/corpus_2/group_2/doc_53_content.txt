          I just saw the CEO of Bank of America on MSNTV and he said the number of banks in the US will be cut in half from the current 9,500--that&amp;amp;#039;s close to 5,000 bank closures.  The big winnder will be the Rothschild&amp;amp;#039;s JP Morgan Chase and Barclays, which will be buying them up.
