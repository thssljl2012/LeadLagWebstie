That surely is the biggest point. Their current market capitalisation is now so low, relative to assets/liabilities, that if someone was going to step in (without some government assistance) they would already have made an offer. The fact they haven&amp;#039;t makes me think that their mortgage book is just simply considered too risky, and no-one will do it without some injection/underwriting etc. from the government. Or they are waiting to see if the government will blink first so they can get a better deal. But I reckon its a symptom that no-one wants them as they stand. Maybe the fact they have now got out of their obligations on buying up yet more dud mortgages from whoever it was (GCAM???) will make them a tad more desirable.
