   House sales tumble as slump bites      August 31, 2008           MELBOURNE&amp;#039;S property market has slumped dramatically over the past three months - and by a staggering 44 per cent over the past year.    Figures compiled by The Sunday Age reveal property sales have dropped from 2032 in the first four weeks of August 2007 to 1131 for the comparable period this year.      Hopes that the prospect of a rate cut on Tuesday would boost the market yesterday proved unfounded, with the clearance rate falling below 60 per cent for the first time this year.      Despite reports that buyers are returning to the market, the clearance rate fell 3 percentage points to 59 per cent.      The Real Estate Institute of Victoria&amp;#039;s chief executive, Enzo Raimondo, said yesterday&amp;#039;s auction results showed that buyers were holding off until the Reserve Bank decided to drop official interest rates.      &amp;#039;&amp;#039;Confidence in the market has not been forthcoming yet,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said. &amp;#039;&amp;#039;People are still waiting for an interest rate cut.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      Mr Raimondo said the downturn may even put some real estate agents out of business.      The Sunday Age figures, compiled from REIV data, reveal the true extent of Melbourne&amp;#039;s real estate slump. Sales were at least 30 per cent down year-on-year for the three months June to August. The slump was especially marked in July, when only 1100 properties were sold,  compared with 1721 the previous year.      The results are the latest in a number of economic indicators which show Victoria is suffering from a severe property slowdown. On Friday it was announced sales of newly built homes had dropped 7.2 per cent this month, while on the same day the Reserve Bank of Australia released figures showing finance for housing rose just 0.5 per cent in July, the smallestmonthly gain since 1989.       http://www.theage.com.au/national/ho...v.html?page=-1          Any armchair property experts care to comment ?
