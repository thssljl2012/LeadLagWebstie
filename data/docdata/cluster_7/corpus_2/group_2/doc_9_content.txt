From the late 1890&amp;#039;s until the late 1980&amp;#039;s all mortgages were underwritten and issued by local banks.  The key in the above statement is that they were underwritten.  If you wanted to buy a home you had to have a down payment, a job and good credit.  Your banker most likely even knew you on a personal level.      These mortgages were viewed all over the world as one of the safest places to invest in.  The local bank would bundle these mortgages in five million dollar bundles and sale them as Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs).  Because the mortgages were underwritten properly they were graded as A rated bonds (Full Doc Mortgages) and were very safe.      Then in the 80&amp;#039;s two things started to happen:      1.  Banks started merging and community banks started disappearing into mega banks.      2.  The world economy started to explode.  Where there was once a world wide economy of less than ten trillion dollars there was now a twenty five trillion dollar world economy, which has since grown to a sixty-five trillion dollar world economy.        As demand for US Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) grew, there were not enough of these &amp;amp;quot;full Doc Mortgages&amp;amp;quot; to fill the need.  So non banks formed by the brokerage houses started getting into the mortgage business.  Loans were being originated by mortgage brokers who were commission motivated not bankers who were there to watch after the banks best interest.  The bonds went from five million dollar offerings to one hundred million dollar offerings with very large profits to brokerage houses who bundled and sold them.      A new class of mortgage was created to fill the market demand for more bonds.  These mortgages started as things like stated income, but with a down payment and good credit, then to stated income, no down payment but good credit then to a No Doc loan.  Just sign this paper saying you can pay the mortgage and we will give you a loan.      This was referred to as the Sub Prime market.      The problem was when the Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) were now going to be issued they were not going to be rated high enough to sale in the bond market so the Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) had to be insured to raise their ratings.      Step in AIG which quickly became the worlds largest insurance company by insuring the Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs).  The bond that was filled with 70% sub-prime mortgages and 30% prime mortgages should have carried a junk rating, but by insuring them they were now A rated bonds.  Now that all the claims are coming in against AIG that they cannot pay, the US Government had no choice but to bail them out or the world economy would employed in ways most people could never imagine.  You see there are over one hundred trillion dollars in US bonds held all over the world, if those bonds imploded so would the economy of almost every country in the world.      This is just the tip of the iceberg, because the commercial loan sector is now starting to have large default rates, so we will have round two over the next three years.      Hold on its going to be a rough road ahead.                      Fascinating read, thanks!      I heard from someone else (my finance guy, he works for AG Edwards) that this is also the &amp;amp;quot;tip of the iceberg.&amp;amp;quot;
