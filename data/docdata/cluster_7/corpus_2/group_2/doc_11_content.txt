       Vanguard claims no holdings of AIG or Lehmans in their money market fund:  September 17, 2008 A word on Vanguard money market funds  The recent bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and widespread turbulence in the financial markets have prompted a number of questions about the impact on Vanguard funds, including money market funds.  Vanguard is confident in the stability of its money market funds, all of which are managed with the objective of maintaining a stable net asset value of $1 a share. Vanguard continues to manage its money market funds very conservatively and with extreme prudence, focusing on high quality, short-term money market instruments.
