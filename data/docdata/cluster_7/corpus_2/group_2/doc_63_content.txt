  If the Chinese or anyone else wanted to buy the stock via a stock issue, then the asking price would be closer to the company&amp;#039;s view of its net present value which is closer to $35 a share or five times the present share price.       What a joke.      Current market cap @ $7 = approx. $20 billion   Market cap @ $35 = approx $100 billion      For a company to be worth $100 billion it has to earn approximately $5 billion every year after tax, interest and capital spending (mining is an expensive business). Is this company even profitable yet? Even at the current market cap it has to earn about $1 billion per year to justify the valuation. For $20 billion would you rather own 100% of FMG or 66% of Woolworths or 33% of the Commonwealth Bank?
