  Hi  With regards to&amp;amp;nbsp;your question&amp;amp;nbsp;I thought it would be useful if I gave you a little background on our commodities trading company. We trade in principal capacity in Oil, Gold and Cement. Zenith will be the ultimate &amp;amp;quot;seller&amp;amp;quot; i.e. not the broker/dealer/agent but the actual seller of cement. We have long term agreements with the cement factories throughout Europe, North America and Africa. We purchase the cement in wholesale and then use our own balance sheet to transact with end buyers hence we do not act as brokers. The principal of Zenith is a well known Hedge/Fund manager, ex-banker who was previously a Managing Director at Barclays Bank, London. I am in charge of originating Zenith&amp;#039;s Cement trading business worldwide. I have a document detailing the specifications of the cement. Please revert with any questions you may have. I look forward to your response.   No contact address here-Mod
