  AIG, Fannie May, and Freddie Mac are not in trouble so much because they made loans, but because they invested in them.      The reason so many mortgage broker outfits went up in smoke is not because the loans they made went bad, but because their customer base dried up.      Regarding all this talk of making bad loans vs. making good loans &amp;amp;#8211; the reason so many banks and mortgage companies were doing so well is because they didn&amp;amp;#8217;t have to consider the risk when making the loans.  They sold them.  They were interested in the fee income, not the interest income.  They passed the interest income (and the risk) on to others.        Fannie May and Freddie Mac didn&amp;amp;#8217;t do mortgages, they bought them from banks and mortgage brokers.  Other investment firms and insurance companies (AIG, Merrill Lynch, etc.) would buy them to.  They&amp;amp;#8217;d bundle all the loans into mortgage backed securities and sell them to investors, investment firms, etc.        The mortgages that were bundled and sold by Fannie May and Freddie Mac had the perception of being backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government (and I guess with the bail out, the argument could be made that they were) so they were gobbled up by investors as high yielding bonds with little risk.  The mortgages bundled and sold by Lehmen Bros., Merrill Lynch, Baird, etc. were called Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMO&amp;amp;#8217;s).  Higher perceived risk, but more interest.  Investors liked these too because they paid higher than corporate bonds or treasury bonds.  Besides, even if a few of the loans in the portfolio default, it&amp;amp;#8217;s not like they all will, right?  Little risk here.  So the investment firms gobbled them up for their bond funds, insurance companies gobbled them up to invest their premiums received that weren&amp;amp;#8217;t being paid out, Fannie and Freddie were holding the actual mortgages, as were Merrill and Lehmen, etc.  Well, it turns out that a whole lot more of the loans can default than expected.        When that happens, and the bank was doing loans at 100%financing because the fee income was so great &amp;amp;#8211; just try collecting on your collateral in a soft market.  You financed a home at 100% in a hot market, you now have to unload the place for 50 &amp;amp;#8211; 80% of the outstanding mortgage (which doesn&amp;amp;#8217;t include paying a realtor or paying investors their interest coupon when you aren&amp;amp;#8217;t receiving any payments for the year it takes to sell the house), and try to make investors happy by paying back their maturing bonds as promised.  Not a good situation.      CRA was mentioned before, and there seem to be some misconceptions about it.  The original intent wasn&amp;amp;#8217;t to force banks to make bad loans in bad areas.  The intent was to put an end to the practice of redlining.  Banks would basically take a map on a wall and draw a red line around a group of neighborhoods and say, &amp;amp;#8220;To save time and money, we aren&amp;amp;#8217;t going to do any loans for any applicant that lives or does business in this area.&amp;amp;#8221;  What CRA required was that banks underwrite all loans on their individual merits and to put branches in these communities.  That means that the person who chooses to purchase a modest house within their means in the city that has acceptable income and strong personal credit can now get a loan that they wouldn&amp;amp;#8217;t otherwise get.  I will agree that the act has overreached in some respects in that banks will say, &amp;amp;#8220;This loan will satisfy our CRA quota so we have to do it.&amp;amp;#8221;  That, to me, is where the act goes wrong.
