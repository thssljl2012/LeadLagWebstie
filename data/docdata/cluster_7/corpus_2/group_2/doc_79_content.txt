 Any lender that can sell AAA mortgage backed securities... big 4, St George, Suncorp, Adelaide Bank, Resi, etc... many non-bank lenders (also these lenders tend to fund small mortgage managers so it&amp;amp;#8217;s a great outcome).     However, I would like to see a longer term commitment to create certainty.
