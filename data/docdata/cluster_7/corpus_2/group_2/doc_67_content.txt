 I also asked Matthew Richardson, from price comparison site moneysupermarket.com. He said:       While all regulated financial advisors in the UK must be authorised by the Financial Services Authority to give advice, it is not necessarily the case that they advise on all the products on the market.      &amp;amp;quot;Many banks employ in-branch advisors, who are a useful resource for customers wishing to talk about their financial situation. Bear in mind, however, that these advisors are likely to be &amp;#039;tied&amp;#039; to the bank&amp;#039;s products and not able to advise on products other than their own. While it is often the case that your bank will offer a wide range of products, it&amp;#039;s important to shop around to make sure you find the best match to your circumstances.      Whole-of-market Independent Financial Advisors can help you do this and be able to confirm they have searched the entire market, but be aware that any form of financial advice often carries a charge  whether implicit or explicit. These charges often consist of two parts: initial (a percentage or fixed amount taken out of your initial investment or product value) and annual (usually a percentage taken from your financial product every year you hold it).      To avoid these charges, those who are more familiar with financial services products, can use a price comparison site such as  moneysupermarket.com  which compares all available products. For example, at present, Barclays and HSBC are both offering an easy access cash ISA at 6.25 per cent.
