 FNM Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 5              This is bad news foir financials   I shorted XLF heavily Friday afternoon, and thought I was screwed when  the bailout was announced, and the WAPO article said preferred would be protected.  Turns out this is bad news for banks---very bad news.  Banks and insurance companies hold the vast majority of the $36 billion in preferred shares.  The banks also own some of the common.  I read somewhere that the banks had already written down $500 million of the preferred on their books.  I believe the preferred shares will now go down precipitously in value, and the banks and insurance companies like AIG(a component of XLF) will be forced to take big writedowns on the drop in value of preferred shares.  They will also lose the income from the preferred dividends.    No way to tell right now how the market will react initially.  CNBC, Cramer and a lot of other idiots(especially those with &amp;quot;some&amp;quot; insider knowledg who ran up the share prices of financials Friday) were cheerleading for a big Monday rally with financials leading the way.  Sometimes when these manipulators start pushing the wagon, the momentum can still push it farther uphill, but within time, probably within a few hours or days, reality will start to sink in.    If XLF goes up tomorrow, I will short it heavily.  If it goes down a little I will just hold on that increase in my XLF short position, and be thankful for the opportunity I got Friday.
