                                   Here&amp;#039;s the way I&amp;#039;ve explained it to my 16 yr old kids.&amp;amp;nbsp; I hope you&amp;#039;ve seen &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s A Wonderful Life&amp;quot;; it helps!&amp;amp;nbsp; I got into fundamentals, so please accept my apologies if you know most of this.&amp;amp;nbsp; *** This is my personal assessment. ***  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Mortgages are specific loans used to purchase houses - homes.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Typically  over the decades the loan has been for 30 years with a fixed interest rate, the house is used as collateral, those taking out the loan [the&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;#039;owners&amp;#039;]&amp;amp;nbsp;live in the house,&amp;amp;nbsp;and the &amp;#039;owners&amp;#039; have proven they can repay the loan.&amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; If the owners become delinquent on the mortgage payments, the house as collateral is taken by the mortgage lender - foreclosure.&amp;amp;nbsp; The owners lose all equity in the home and their credit rating tanks.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  For decades, mortgage lenders also known as mortgage brokers were also neighbors.&amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Here&amp;#039;s where &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s a Wonderful Life&amp;quot; comes in - When George writes mortgages for his fellow townspeople, he knows he will hold that mortgage for its&amp;#039; full term [typ 30 yrs] or the house is resold.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; It is critically important for him to know that the mortgages will be repaid.&amp;amp;nbsp; Multiple reasons: the mortgage payments include overhead [cost of doing business, salaries, etc], his profit, and bring in cash which he will use to write more mortgages.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; When people fall behind, he has the discretion to rework the&amp;amp;nbsp;mortgage terms, forgive payments, accept late payments without penalty and more. He knows why the Smiths are falling behind; Mr Smith broke his leg and is out of work [an example].  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;   If many people default and homes are foreclosed, his cash flow reduces to a trickle.&amp;amp;nbsp; He doesn&amp;#039;t have the funds to write new loans, pay the utilities or anything else.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Instead, George has a bunch of houses he now owns.&amp;amp;nbsp; To&amp;amp;nbsp;increase cash flow, he has to sell the houses.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;George is a businessman selling houses, not a family selling a home.&amp;amp;nbsp; He needs to recover only the outstanding loan principal, though he&amp;#039;d love to recover more.&amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; A family OTOH needs to sell their home at a price that at minimum covers their down payment, the principal they&amp;#039;ve paid on the mortgage, and the remaining mortgage balance.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; George can tolerate selling his houses for less than the family can.&amp;amp;nbsp; So he does; he needs the cash, not the houses.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Foreclosed houses sell for less than family-owned houses.&amp;amp;nbsp; The family-owned houses take longer to sell.&amp;amp;nbsp; If too many foreclosed houses are on the market,&amp;amp;nbsp;the&amp;amp;nbsp;asking price must go down for family-owned houses too, if the family needs to sell.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Housing prices drop.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;With mortgages retained by the original mortgage lender, the process remains local, and more personal.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, government chartered but not government run, are in the business of buying mortgages from lenders like George.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The companies purchased individual mortgages.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Selling the mortgages provided George with cash more quickly than the mortgage payments could ever do.&amp;amp;nbsp; George used the cash to write more mortgages.&amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;amp;nbsp;  Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are less personal.&amp;amp;nbsp; Mortgages are less the means for people to obtain homes and more &amp;#039;mere&amp;#039; pieces of paper.&amp;amp;nbsp; It&amp;#039;s easier to impose late penalties, to foreclose in precise accordance with the contract.&amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;amp;nbsp;  After some deregulation laws were passed - again, I don&amp;#039;t have specifics - &amp;quot;mortgage backed securities&amp;quot; were created.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; A company would buy mortgages and lump a group into a mortgage-backed security {mbs}.&amp;amp;nbsp; Let&amp;#039;s say a mbs has mortgages totaling $100M.&amp;amp;nbsp; The company sells pieces of the mbs for $1M.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The security has firm payments with defined profits since the interest rates are fixed.&amp;amp;nbsp; The purchasers have strong faith that they will retain their initial investment and get a fixed profit.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Afterall, mortgages have low default rates; lenders verify credit and ability to repay; typically the last thing owners want to lose is their home.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Yet....  the mortgage lenders realize that they will get their commission when they write a mortgage, and then the mortgage will be sold.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Repayment isn&amp;#039;t a primary concern for the lenders - those who purchase the mortgages are assuming that risk.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; If repayment isn&amp;#039;t as critical, then ensuring the owners have good credit and ability to pay is less critical.&amp;amp;nbsp; Lenders become willing to write mortgages for those without good credit, without proven ability to repay.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The mortgage buyers don&amp;#039;t catch on to this shift by the mortgage lenders.&amp;amp;nbsp; Gradually more mortgages default.&amp;amp;nbsp; More foreclosed houses are on the market.&amp;amp;nbsp; Housing prices fall.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Those actually holding the mortgages have cash flow problems.&amp;amp;nbsp; Bad debt sits on their accounting ledgers, with no&amp;amp;nbsp;money coming in.  &amp;amp;nbsp; So the mortgages buyers can&amp;#039;t buy from the mortgage lenders.&amp;amp;nbsp; The lenders have cash flow problems.&amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The lenders can&amp;#039;t write new mortgages without money.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Without new mortgages, people can&amp;#039;t buy houses.&amp;amp;nbsp; Less qualified buyers turns the housing market into a buyers&amp;#039; market - and housing prices fall.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  The&amp;amp;nbsp;cycle goes around and around.&amp;amp;nbsp; Companies write off bad debt.&amp;amp;nbsp; Significant amounts of bad debt make investors leery.&amp;amp;nbsp; Leery investors take their money elsewhere.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Companies are left with huge amounts of bad debt on their books.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The fed gov&amp;#039;t bailed out Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to stabilize the mortgage industry.&amp;amp;nbsp; They allowed Lehamn Brothers to go bankrupt.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; With AIG, there&amp;#039;s another weird security w/ insurance that is so convoluted I read that &amp;#039;they&amp;#039; {AIG and customers} aren&amp;#039;t really sure who owns what exactly.&amp;amp;nbsp; It&amp;#039;s a global entity, with the ability to smash the insurance industry if it went bankrupt.&amp;amp;nbsp; So AIG was bailed out.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Finally Bush and Co, and Congress, recognized that a piecemeal approach wasn&amp;#039;t going to alleviate the crisis.  &amp;amp;nbsp; Thus was born the huge bailout.&amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;The fed gov&amp;#039;t will provide the funds - in other words, the fed gov&amp;#039;t will buy the bad debt from various companies. (I have no info on the criteria or companies.)&amp;amp;nbsp; The companies will take the bad debt off their books, and have cash to go buy more mortgages from the lenders.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; With money, the lenders will be able to write mortgages.&amp;amp;nbsp; Etc.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;   The fed gov&amp;#039;t will acquire the assets - the collateral - backing the mortgages.&amp;amp;nbsp; IMO one big unknown is how those houses will be sold, and what the cumulative value will be.   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; During the savings and loan bailout, according to an article I read this week, the gov&amp;#039;t acquired the S&amp;amp;amp;Ls as assets.&amp;amp;nbsp; The sales bruoght in money that covered about 50% of the predicted bailout cost.&amp;amp;nbsp; What will happen in this case?  &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  The typical mortgage is 30 yrs, fixed rate.&amp;amp;nbsp; There are many other types, including ARM - adjustable rate mortgage.&amp;amp;nbsp; DH &amp;amp;amp; I had one in the 80s - our ARM rate was 12%.&amp;amp;nbsp; Remember, ARM rates are lower than fixed rates.&amp;amp;nbsp; For reference, fixed rates today are ~6%.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The theory - the bet, the risk - is that the mortgage rates will drop before the ARM adjusts upward.&amp;amp;nbsp; And that the rates will sufficiently drop so that the fixed rate payment is affordable.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Playing into the equation are elements such as expected income&amp;amp;nbsp;increase, increased home value, and just how low the mortgage rates will drop.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Home value vs. mortgage amount is important.&amp;amp;nbsp; If the mortgage exceeds {I think 80%} of home value, mortgage insurance is required - adding to monthly payments.&amp;amp;nbsp; If the mortgage amount being refinanced is greater than the current value of the home -- well, the collateral must be worth at least the mortgage amount, so the new mortgage is not possible.  &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; As long as the owners continue paying on the current mortgage, it&amp;#039;s unlikely the mortgage holder will cancel the mortgage [I don&amp;#039;t know the legal nuances].&amp;amp;nbsp; But the ARM rate goes up, the&amp;amp;nbsp;owner is unable to make the payments, a foreclosure occurs -- and an impersonal entity has another house to sell.&amp;amp;nbsp; The part about housing prices dropping continues.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Darn - I got interrupted.&amp;amp;nbsp; Kids!  Ah --  Other factors:  owners purchasing houses beyond their means, betting on increased income and home value  owners not understanding the fine print  lenders not explaining the fine print  lenders not concerned about ability to repay  high housing costs in some areas almost compelling buyers to go beyond their means  and more....  &amp;amp;nbsp;  I&amp;#039;m sure I&amp;#039;ve gotten some details not quite right, and there are numerous other factors as critical as those I&amp;#039;ve noted.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  IMO the increased distance between the mortgage holders and home owners, and the reduced risk/impact of default to lenders are key.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;                                                                            &amp;amp;#8230;where I want to be&amp;amp;#8230;               &amp;quot;All it takes for the triumph of evil is for good (wo)men to do nothing&amp;quot; - Edmund Burke
