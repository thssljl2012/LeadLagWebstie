 Precious Metals Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              I&amp;#039;ll say a close by GLD over 78 is a BUY, today.   At this juncture with the pressure on the metal coming from CRUDE being down 3-4 dollars and the USD being up a percent it doesn&amp;#039;t look too likely that GLD will close over 78 which is equal to 790 or so for spot gold, but if it does, I am buying..     http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=gld&amp;amp;p=D&amp;amp;yr=0&amp;amp;mn=9&amp;amp;dy=0&amp;amp;id=p32549698711&amp;amp;a=73901125&amp;amp;listNum=1     As for the dollar, see UUP, dollar ETF....flash back up to broken trend line...   http://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=UUP&amp;amp;p=D&amp;amp;yr=0&amp;amp;mn=6&amp;amp;dy=0&amp;amp;id=p74240567207&amp;amp;a=151014454&amp;amp;listNum=1     A FED funds and discount rate cut would turn the dollar down and gold up, but I don&amp;#039;t think that is in the cards. I think AIG goes down...insurance policies protected, their derivative house of cards tumbles...At some point money flows into gold as a safe haven..    See what happends in a few hours.
