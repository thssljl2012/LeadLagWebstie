As Want2retire mentioned above, this &amp;amp;quot;money market funds&amp;amp;quot; are not (FDIC) insured.      Should i be concerned about this enough to move it back to a &amp;amp;quot;money market account&amp;amp;quot; at my local bank where it is FDIC insured.      Or are &amp;amp;quot;money market funds&amp;amp;quot; protected in some other way that makes them ok?                      Currently they are protected by a government insurance scheme announced this week. Up until now, they were not protected but had never lost money, and it is not known how long the new government protection will last, but I shouldn&amp;#039;t worry.
