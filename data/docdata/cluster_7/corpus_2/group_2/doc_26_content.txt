Brag again - it took cajones to do that.    You may be right, but too much risk for me...I&amp;#039;ll admit, I don&amp;#039;t have that kind of hutzpa.    Why not Berkshire?  Warren and Charlie understand real-world risk as well as anybody on the planet.  They have a fortress of a balance sheet.  They are the ones that will be cleaning up when the rip-off artists are all dead and gone.  They will pick through the asset carnage and leave the bones and sinew for the smaller vultures.  They will own the bond insurance business for years.    I was buying Berkshire, gold and silver with both hands this last week.    Good luck to both of us.    Steve      thread start
