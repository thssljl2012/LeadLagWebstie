 You forgot the most important parts Pepper..                                             Quote:                    Respondents included a who&amp;#039;s who of the Australian property universe, including the Commonwealth Bank, NAB, Westpac, ANZ, Macquarie Bank, JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Lend Lease, GPT Group, Mirvac, Ernst &amp;amp;amp; Young, Jones Lang LaSalle and CB Richard Ellis.                                              ...                                            Quote:                   Of significance was that most respondents said yields across all property sectors would increase,  not due to rental shortages but because prices would drop  as the higher price of risk capital was factored in.                                             ...                                            Quote:                   Most respondents thought it would be unlikely that residential property would outstrip equity market returns soon, although on a five-year outlook the chances narrowed to about even.                                             So even the &amp;#039;experts&amp;#039; agree the market is headed for a downturn and lower prices in the next couple of years.. higher yields, but only due to lower prices..
