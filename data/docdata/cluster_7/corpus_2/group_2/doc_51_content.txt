         Every little helps, but one wonders whether RBS&amp;#039;s subsidiaries will apply for the whole amount this article suggests would qualify under the bail-out arrangements.   Under the proposed terms of the rescue package, non-US financial institutions can benefit from the scheme, provided they have significant operations in the US.   However, the degree to which the banks can benefit from the fund is dependent on the price at which the asset purchase scheme is set. If it is too low, for example, they might face another round of painful writedowns.   Analysts have warned that in this case, Barclays could have the most to lose. Having taken minimal writedowns on its 11.5bn of qualifying assets, the bank may be forced to take another deep hit that could destroy more capital.   RBS may benefit as its remaining 3.3bn of qualifying assets have been written down aggressively already. If so, its capital position could improve.    http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcr...   Apparently HSBC may get most benefit from the proposed bail-out with $24.1bn of US residential and commercial mortgage securities that may qualify for the Troubled Asset Relief Programme and possibly another $80bn of outstanding direct home loans.
