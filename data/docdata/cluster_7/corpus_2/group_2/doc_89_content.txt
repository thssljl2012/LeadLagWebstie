There&amp;#039;s been bigger one day sell offs of oil recently. Anyway, it&amp;#039;s brought it down to $90-ish a barrel. Not bad, two months and a 40% drop.      As I said 3 months ago, sell your oil shares while you still can.      Of course, with the oil price, share prices and house prices collapsing, where is this money going? It must be going somewhere, whenever a firm collapses, someone benefits. Whether it be picking up assets for a bargain or capital moving to a different sector of the economy, it&amp;#039;s all relative. Even if everything goes down, those with their cash in a savings account will be the winners as relatively speaking, they&amp;#039;re doing quite well compared to everyone else...                      barclays uk are buying the lot to make them 3rd largest investment bank in the US. they bought the manhattan headquarters on the cheap.
