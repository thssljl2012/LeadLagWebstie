                                         Quote:                          Originally Posted by  Kauri                         news on AIG is worse as there are reports that the global insurance giant will     file for bankruptcy Wednesday      if  they don&amp;#039;t find capital today.   I smell capitulation, of the short term variety, in the air but there are two more events that must take place first - the FOMC meeting and Morgan Stanley Q3 earnings Wednesday before the bell.       Cheers...I tink   .................Kauri       Incidentally... of course...The Russian stock exchange has been closed for an hour after a 16.6% collapse on the day; the Ruble has strengthened but only because the central bank has kept a lid on it; USD/ZAR has jumped to 8.1800 after a respite to 7.9900 yesterday; USD/TRY hit 1.2765; and in Asian markets the KRW was under huge pressure hitting 1165, the first time in 4- yrs. USD/PHP hit a 1-yr high; and USD/TWD tested the &amp;amp;quot;08 highs.       Slainte   ...........Lauri                                                Weird stuff happening, former AIG CEO Greenberg is jawbowning the market saying everything is fine with AIG. Guess we&amp;#039;ll see.
