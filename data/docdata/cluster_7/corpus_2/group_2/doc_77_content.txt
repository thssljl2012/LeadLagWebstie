Isn&amp;#039;t it amazing how many of the same players just keep coming up?      REMEMBER - Barclays is the one who was going to buy-out Lehman Bros over the weekend, but backed out, now showing interest in only buying a portion of the company that handles &amp;amp;quot;U.S. broker-dealer business, including equity, fixed income, M&amp;amp;amp;A advisory and other parts.&amp;amp;quot;   Does it not get the gears grinding when you think that Barclays is a major holder in Lehman already (4th largest holder of controlling shares), yet they allowed the business to get into this kind of shape? Or was it really a surprise to them? And why would you wait so late to even begin talks about a takeover or buyout? And why would you even be interested in just  a part of that company TODAY as indicated in this article ?      C&amp;#039;mon guys... doesn&amp;#039;t something smell just a  little  bit fishy?
