 Great stuff thanks lakemac, and a question for you also.      You say in your post re central banks:                                           Quote:                          Originally Posted by  lakemac                         Ok first up - central banks are neither benign nor neutral. They were created by bankers for bankers under the guise of stabilising the markets. They are not, repeat not, part of the government.                                             Can you comment on the differences between the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Federal Reserve Board in the US?
