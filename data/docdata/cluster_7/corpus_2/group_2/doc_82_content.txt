         comp,  &amp;amp;quot; Barclays didn&amp;#039;t just rush in because they saw a bargain. They WERE rushed in because they were a counterparty to Lehmans as much as anything else. Indeed they very nearly bought the entire company just a day before it folded. That&amp;#039;s the fact of it. Check where the CEO of Barclays was the day before Lehman&amp;#039;s folded - considering buying the thing for a hefty sum!  This argument is attributing skill where in fact there is simply an ability to fail to execute in the actions they have been clearly trying to take.  If you don&amp;#039;t think Barclays was actively trying to acquire the entirety of ABN and the entirety of Lehmans at what turned out to be the worst possible time and for what would have been gigantic sums of money, then it will be hard for us to continue to discuss this, as I perceive this as well-established and generally-accepted fact. &amp;amp;quot;    Isn&amp;#039;t it possible that BARC  were  in talks to buy the whole company but then  skillfully  managed to read the runes and stopped short of making an offer with the knowledge that such a pullback would accelerate the decline of said company into Chapter 11 therefore hopefully enabling them a short time later to an  actual  offer on  better  terms?  I know I have used a show of interest then a show of lack of interest to get the price for some goods I wished to purchase down in price, and I doubt I am unique in this tactic.  awbMaven
