The greatest supply  predictor of natural gas is price. It is clear that supply changes operate with a lag but they do respond.   Here is where I see a potential flaw in his argument on the supply side.  1. Initial decline rates are very high. As production grows they will impact supply negatively as these new wells are subject to these high decline rates. This problem is much more severe the higher the percentage of new wells.  2. There are many high cost producers that depend on high single or double digit NG prices. The longer prices remain depressed, the more we will see these wells shut in or drilling curtailed by operators.     3 Production increases we are seeing now are based on decisions when prices were in double digits.  None of us fully understand the price impact on production let alone the lag time when  it takes effect.   4. The market has yet to take into account the current scope of production curtailments. At present 51bcft and counting. we can count on a doubling of those production curtailments. Power has still not been restored, and damage assessment is yet to be completed.  These numbers have not yet shown up in any statistics but they will. Add to that the REX shut in requirements, and it begins to add up.    Now on the demand side, everything I have seen has been very bearish this summer.  1. Generational demand for electricity has suffered from   (a) Reduced overall electricity demand which impact NG disproportionately.  (b) Reduced seasonal cooling demand requiring peak power normally supplied NG generation.    2. Weakness in industrial demand.   There is a huge capacity for natural gas generation that has been underutilized this year. Had we seen full utilization of that capacity we would be talking about summer draws not builds.     Now looking forward, heating demand will be the big elephant in the room this winter, especially if the cooler weather starts early. With the supply disruptions we have seen and an early winter, we will be back in doubler digits in no time. This market is singularly focused on production growth as the price driver for natural gas, and seems to be ignoring potential demand and supply drivers that could dwarf extrapolation of historical production based on optimistic NG price expectations.
