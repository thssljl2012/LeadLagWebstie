&amp;amp;quot;Has to be done - the lack of financial regulation...&amp;amp;quot;    I hear you on the subject of bad financial governance, afterall - except one wonders why in February 2008 HSH Nordbank, one of Germany&amp;#039;s biggest banks apparently, sued a Swiss bank, UBS, over its exposure to subprime American mortgages in CDOs.     Swiss banks - ah, yes, Swiss banks. Somehow when one thinks &amp;#039;Swiss bank&amp;#039; the word &amp;#039;transparency&amp;#039; does not automatically spring to mind. (I know, I&amp;#039;m being unfair here, given their reforms of late, but the point is apt: European banks got themselves embroiled, nobody put a gun to their respective heads.)    Then there&amp;#039;s Barclays - not that Barclays is in Europe, exactly, but the naive and innocent HSH also sued them as well over much the same issue.     Then there&amp;#039;s the naive and innocent French bank Paribas - closed three funds that had American subprime exposure.     I say &amp;#039;naive and innocent&amp;#039; with tongue in cheek, of course, since it seems as long as the instruments in question were making money, European bankers were no more apt than their American counterparts to ask too many questions about how all this miracle money was being made. Yet the European banking community should surely have been familiar with the Dutch tulip bubble of 1637, such that they should have known how to avoid investing in bubbles of any type or nationality whatsoever.     So can it be that - gasp- Europeans are as subject to the same human failings as the rest of us?
