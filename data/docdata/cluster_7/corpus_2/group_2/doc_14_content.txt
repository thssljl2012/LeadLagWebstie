 SWISS banking giant UBS is looking at a massive inward investment to Manchester, in a move that would create up to 1,000 jobs.      As the credit crunch continues to rock business confidence worldwide following this weeks collapse of Lehman Brothers and the financial crisis engulfing insurance mammoth AIG, the MEN understands that investment decisions are close on two headline relocation projects, UBS and American giant Goldman Sachs.      A key source in Manchesters commercial property sector said: Manchester has been on the radar of both USB and Goldman for some time. I know there have been visits to the city by both institutions.      Despite the crisis engulfing the whole finance sector, these global investment projects are driven by institutions need to cut costs and increase profits. Manchester has put forward a compelling case which would allow this to happen.      Both of these projects are of similar scale, and would give a massive boost to the city.      The source said Allied Londons Spinningfields scheme would be an obvious location for any inward investor, as it is already the home to a host of legal and financial firms, and has been chosen as the location for Bank of New York Mellons expanded Manchester operation.      The MEN also understands that the European bosses of Lehman Brothers were also looking at Manchester as an alternative location to its City of London operations in the months before its collapse.      Colin Sinclair, chief executive of MIDAS, Greater Manchesters inward investment agency said: I cannot comment on individual projects. Client confidentiality is crucial..      Our ambition is to build on Manchesters credentials as a complementary offer to London for financial services, and as a matter of course we speak to numerous institutions on a regular basis. The global banking and finance community is in the midst of one of its most turbulent periods, and Manchester has to make the most of the opportunity to demonstrate that it has a compelling offer in terms of the talent pool, location, and connectivity.      People should bear in mind that any potential global investor will be looking at numerous other locations, both in the UK and Europe and we cannot take anything for granted.        http://www.manchestereveningnews.co....s_in_city_move
