  dimbo61 - I plan to move in around 2 years time so didn&amp;#039;t want to tie myself down with a 5 year fixed at this point.      dwsjarcmd - I factored in a 20% fall in the value of the house from it&amp;#039;s peak to still just scrap a 60% LTV. Other houses on the street have fallen 5-10% based on very recent sales/current prices so I think I should be safe with that LTV.      I&amp;#039;ll take a look at the barclays one, I also got recommended one this morning from halifax (I&amp;#039;m with them now) at 5.74% 2 year fixed 499 fee so that seems a decent option?     Thanks     Simon
