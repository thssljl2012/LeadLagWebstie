 BAK Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 3              The future&amp;#039;s uncertain and the end is always near.   &amp;quot;I just wanna get my kicks before the whole shithouse goes up in flames.&amp;quot; - Jim Morrison  ** From an FT op ed in Tuesday&amp;#039;s paper - amazing stats.      The crucial problem on this side of the Atlantic is that the largest  European banks have become not only too big to fail, but also too big  to be saved.  For example, the total liabilities of Deutsche Bank  (leverage ratio over 50!) amount to about &amp;amp;#8364;2,000bn (more than Fannie  Mae) or more than 80 per cent of the gross domestic product of Germany.   This is simply too much for the Bundesbank or even the German state,  given that the German budget is bound by the rules of the European  Union&amp;amp;#8217;s stability pact and the German government cannot order (unlike  the US Treasury) its central bank to issue more currency. Similarly,  the total liabilities of Barclays of around 1,300bn (leverage ratio  60!) are roughly equivalent to the GDP of the UK. Fortis bank has a  leverage ratio of &amp;amp;#8220;only&amp;amp;#8221; 33, but its liabilities are three times the  GDP of its home country of Belgium.       http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ 41960e1c-8972-11dd-8371- 0000779fd18c.html
