         Hello Apanda and thanks for the extension.  Since everyone is so gloomy on financials, my three are:  BARC.L  Barclays RBS.L   Royal Bank of Scotland PRU.L   Prudential  While the current troubles clearly have some way to go yet (we are at &amp;#039;the middle of the middle&amp;#039; of the crisis as someone said the other day - was it Marben?) I believe these 3 will all survive and benefit from taking business from the weaker players and those who have simply disappeared.  The reduced competition means they have considerable pricing power which I am sure they will use to the full, whether with corporate or retail customers.  Finally, they all have global presence - unlike LLOY, whose UK retail focus has been a strength so far but I am not sure this will be the case in future.  I hold all three.  regards,
