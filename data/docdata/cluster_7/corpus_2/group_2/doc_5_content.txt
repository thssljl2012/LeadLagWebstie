         Never heard of this company before but a quick read through of Yahoo&amp;#039;s headline stories is impressive. Not a knock to be found and some high praise for MKL&amp;#039;s financial strength and good management. Superficial to be sure so FWIW. Charts show the same old story for MKV as for all the rest of the really good pfds and etds but not quite as drastic probably due to the quality of the company. As good as the bargains in reit pfds have been lately, insurance pfds have been better. Why? The insurance pfds i keep on radar all have investment grade ratings and have good yields so therefore it makes sense that they would be held on a wider scale by institutions and hedge funds. They might be held more widely as insurance companies might not be seen to be damaged so much by the real estate/sub prime/FNM-FRE/bank failure general debacle. AIG is an insurance company but it is not that part of the business that is their problem. Their general insurance businesses are strong and will be sold off for profit. Whatever, i think it&amp;#039;s clear insurance pfds have been hit hard by deleveraging. I&amp;#039;ve said it too many times....price declines caused by deleveraging of pfd stocks = buy.  Here are some insurance pfds on my screen.....AHL-A, AXS-A, ENH-A, MET-B, PHR, PL-D, PRE-C,D, RE-B, RNR-C. I&amp;#039;ve been accumulating AHL-A and ENH-A as price gyrations have been extreme. ENH-A is the current yield king at 13.7%. It&amp;#039;s interesting to note that all of these yield over 10% except PHR...9.5%. Have a look at the one year chart for all of these and pay attention to the price action after the July low. It&amp;#039;s enticing. Holding these forever is also appealing...........Xot
