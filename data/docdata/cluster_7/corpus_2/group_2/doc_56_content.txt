 NXG Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Barclays to the Rescue    http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;sid=aa2xjRZmqdpI&amp;amp;refer=home     With Barclays buying the &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; assets this should bode well for NXG imho. As a major shareholder they would have every motivation to settle the ARS lawsuit quickly and in NXG&amp;#039;s favor.
