         ee,  &amp;amp;quot;Yes. There will definitely be losses!  However, quantifying them is an impossibility unless one knows the outstanding mark to market exposures (which nobody will know accurately until the banks look at exactly what provision they should make).&amp;amp;quot;    This is the interesting bit to me as UK banks afaik only have to mark-to-model usually (and I bet their models did not have this factored into them ;) ), but it does seem that now they will have to mark-to-market the affected exposure.  Looking at the % fallers today, HBOS down 18%, RBS down 11%, Barclays down 10%, LloydsTSB down 5%, HSBC down 3%. Not sure if these % falls indicate these are the worst effected (????).  awbMaven     Rbs and Barclays come as no surprise, given their huge derivative operations, both in london, and the US/Asia where they often act as market makers in all kinds of derivative products.  HSBC also is pretty active but seems to be somewhat insulated as a result of its Asian exposure, particularly the ever enlarging market of China.    Hbos is just up the swanny.
