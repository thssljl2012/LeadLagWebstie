                                         Quote:                   A consortium of 10 global commercial and investment banks announced plans to provide 70 billion dollars to help offset a credit squeeze.      Bank of America, Barclays, Citibank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and UBS, said in a joint statement they &amp;amp;quot;initiated a series of actions to help enhance liquidity and mitigate the unprecedented volatility and other challenges affecting global equity and debt markets.&amp;amp;quot;                                             From the ABC web site.      I don&amp;#039;t think anything can stop this now.      The market will fall because the companies that make up the market will not be worth what they were a few months ago and whats more it wont come back in a hurry.      This isn&amp;#039;t panic this is logic.      I saw this coming 3 years ago, but the boom just kept going ...........til now.
