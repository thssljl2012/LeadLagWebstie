     I don&amp;#039;t post on these boards often. You will see my post BrK.A more than any other. I shorted that skunk stock, also. WEB is a socialist humanist and I if you ever short or straddle, go there. Candy stores and oldies don&amp;#039;t grow in this environment. And with the Gates charity involved......it&amp;#039; was a no brainer. That said................Leh is a diamond in the rough, at this point. You see barclay making a bid on &amp;#039;&amp;#039;good&amp;#039;&amp;#039; assets? Well. so what. Bac and China sov, and my mama want the good assets. You got a billion dollar building sitting on the square with 1.1 million square ft trading floor&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;and other assets not mentioned and a port with NB and the majority holders being the employee&amp;#039;s and the writeDOWNS reversing over time..........IT IS A STEAL! I don&amp;#039;t care about Monday morning. Hope it goes to 50 cent............I&amp;#039;ll buy it all day long no matter WHAT the headlines say. THey don&amp;#039;t have a choice?? Oh yes they do! This NOT a GSE and the government trying to make LEH holders the sacraficial lambs for the sake of financial markerts is BULL! They&amp;#039;re lying! Here&amp;#039;s why.........this is not Pauls company nor GS or the governments! It is not a GSE riddled with INTENTIONALLY bad paper. AS is FNM and FRE. They intentiionally buy bad with good. Required by law. Higher rates for higher risk folk. Leh has no policy enforcement on intentional bad. That said..............If Barclaywith ALL it&amp;#039;s on probems is willing to bid.....................watch.just watch...................you think others aren&amp;#039;t going to come in?? Oh they will. It&amp;#039;s called POKER! They want to see how much barclays will offer.gives them discount value...........NB is valued between 10 and 15 billion as of last week. YOu think it&amp;#039;s worth 1/3 folks.this week???????? Why would they offer 1/3? FEAR! Leh ain&amp;#039;t no fools. They will file for protection before they sell at that price. The threat by firms DROPPING LEH if stock goes below 3 is a bluff! Drop them and LOSE THE DESK! The set-up of a trading floor like LEH is a cost that this market cannot afford. Experience and goodwill will be a plus. So let the GS and BAC&amp;#039;s balk............at their own risk of MORE scrutiny. GS is one I do not trust. Strange their crytal ball is so perfect. Even if a deal is announced TODAY! Don&amp;#039;t sell. I guarantee you that the time frame will allow other suiters to BID-UP! DON&amp;quot;T SELL AT THIS LEVEL! Let&amp;#039;s roll!         &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; James Jacobsen
