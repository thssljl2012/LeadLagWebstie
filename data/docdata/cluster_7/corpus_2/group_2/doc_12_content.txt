          Acquires investment bank and capital markets group for $2b   No surprise at all, as I&amp;#039;d suggested back here:   http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11215414   http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11220249   ....and as supremetwo points out, so much better value than ABN AMRO was for RBS!  Lehmans is a very much more important player in the global investment banking world than ABN and, if Barclays can stop their new assets from walking out of the door (as they probably can in current circumstances!) and cherry-pick a working global organisation from the Lehmans wreckage (more difficult, but far from impossible) then they have probably just bought themselves a seat at the top table of global financial markets, whilst leaving RBS and HSBC miles behind in the investment banking world!  Very positive and exciting for Barclays in the medium/long term, IMO! Short-term, though, there will be major integration challenges!  ee
