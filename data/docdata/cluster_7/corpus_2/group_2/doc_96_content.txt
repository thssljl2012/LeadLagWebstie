Does &amp;amp;quot;investment banking&amp;amp;quot; really generate value for anyone but the employees?      If you sum up the market cap of the US investment banking sector in 1979, and you sum it up today, and you multiply by the equivilant return on 30-year US Treasury bonds, which has provided the better return to shareholders?  What about after accounting for dilution?    Seems to me, from an &amp;#039;owners&amp;#039; point of view, US investment banking has been mostly a complete disaster over the past 30 years in the &amp;#039;average&amp;#039; instance (yes, there have been relative success stories, ie: Goldman Sachs has survived and they&amp;#039;ve been relatively immune to most of the worst so far).  The distribution of profits from investment banking seems to be completely assymetric; the employees take a disproportionate amount of the profits when times are good, and they still get paid well when times are comparatively bad.  The shareholders are left with little, and to add insult to injury, many of the big investment banking firms barely paid any dividends.  Basically, the employees couldn&amp;#039;t lose, and were vastly overpaid for the true &amp;#039;skills&amp;#039; they brought to the table.  Getting a CFA designation and becoming an analyst or a trader isn&amp;#039;t rocket science -- leave the &amp;#039;rocket science&amp;#039; for the true rocket scientists, please, lol.    (geez, I wonder why they didn&amp;#039;t pay dividends...is it because most of their profits were based on mark-to-market fantasies, and not realized cash flows...  ).                      &amp;amp;lt;Imagines the post move into the Career forums&amp;amp;gt; Who cares!  They pay 20-50% of your base in Bonuses for non &amp;#039;revenue&amp;#039; generating departments, and 50-200% for ones that do generate &amp;#039;revenue&amp;#039;!  It holds not only for the American Investment banks but others in Europe also.    The European banks dish out decent dividends.... Barclays, UBS, Credite Suisse and Deutsche Bank, all around 1-5%... And it&amp;#039;s not like the Canadian banks dividends are great either..
