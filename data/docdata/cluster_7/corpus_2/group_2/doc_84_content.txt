         It doesn&amp;#039;t strike me as particularly brutal.   MYH say that they are trading within their banking facilities. I am not sure what they mean by facilities but they are in breach of various covenants. On July 22nd they announced;   http://www.investegate.co.uk/Article.aspx?id=200807220700055...    The Company is currently in constructive discussions with Lloyds TSB regarding the re-negotiation of its 8 million bank facility. These discussions are being held as a result of the deteriorating economic outlook in the United Kingdom and the Company&amp;#039;s reduced trading expectations set out in the interim results announcement released on 30 June 2008, which has meant that the Company is in breach of some of the covenants within the bank facility agreement. The bank is aware of these breaches but remains committed to a restructuring of the facility.   Debt is undoubtedly a risk but breaking covenants is a crisis. It entitles the bank to look at their loans, and the viability of the business concerned, de novo.   IMV MYH is being somewhat disingenuous with today&amp;#039;s statement. I think today&amp;#039;s news is the result of the failings of MYH rather than any exceptional brutality from Lloyds.
