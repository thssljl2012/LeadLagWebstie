 RBS analysts in a note to clients today said Barclays may need to raise as much a Stg 7.5 bln to bring its capital ratio in line with investment banking peers. RBS cut its rating on Barclay&amp;#039;s stock to &amp;amp;quot;sell&amp;amp;quot; from &amp;amp;quot;hold&amp;amp;quot;.    Now watch Barclays cut its rating on the haggis munchers..          Cheers  ...........Kauri
