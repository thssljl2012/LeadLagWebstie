    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              Re: Add AIG insurance to the list of dead men walking   us2u001    I was referring primarily to the US markets. I said a few months ago that the TSX was at a greater risk than the US markets because of my shorter term outlook on commodities - we have seen the TSX catch up to the NY markets and both the US and Canadian markets have completed the bulk of their initial decline and don&amp;#039;t feel this is the beginning of a &amp;quot;major&amp;quot; slide though it is quite possible we could see some additional downside.    But all in all, my views are not that far from yours with the major difference being one of timing - I expect further out, we are likely to see a major decline in the markets - I just don&amp;#039;t think it is going to happen now. I do expect a major slide coming after the next major top which has definitely not taken place recently in either the US or Canada.    Guessing, I would expect the next major decline to get started in the summer o 2009 and bottom in 2011.      thread start
