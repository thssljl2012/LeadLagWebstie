It looks like it is leaning more and more toward&amp;amp;nbsp;buying security at market price. The issue is that even thought &amp;quot;market price&amp;quot; with government come in should be higher than the &amp;quot;fire sales&amp;quot; price that private vulture demand&amp;amp;nbsp; at this point, but there is no guarantee that banks will have enough capital once they start marking their book base on the new market price.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; And they will be forced to mark their book once the price is discovered.&amp;amp;nbsp; Some banks has done a good job in marking their book and they may have a write up and other will have to severely write downt their book (any bet on C will write up or down??).&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;And&amp;amp;nbsp;no one really know which&amp;amp;nbsp;bank is going to do what. I think that is&amp;amp;nbsp;the reason that Benanke initially want to&amp;amp;nbsp;buy them at&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;held to maturity&amp;quot;&amp;amp;nbsp;price...&amp;amp;nbsp; And the really scary thought here is what if WFC, JPM etc get hit as well?? Do we really know whether they will do mark up or mark donw once the real price is discovered?    &amp;amp;nbsp;    The second key is private money willingness to recap&amp;amp;nbsp; banks.. And this is the scary one.&amp;amp;nbsp; With all the banks raised capital at the same time,&amp;amp;nbsp;we will&amp;amp;nbsp;have a lot of them left behind and fold. So the surviving banks will do great but what happen to lending and hence our economy??? I would imagine that we will have at least a 6-9 months period that money is even tighter than now. So our choice is a recession or a severe recession.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;    It seems like shorting a packing of banks (SKF etc..) or the general stock market is a way to at least hedge our port and may be benefit from the chaos.. Any thoughts...          thread start
