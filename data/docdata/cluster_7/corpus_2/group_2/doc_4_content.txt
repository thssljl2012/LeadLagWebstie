 DNDN Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 16              Mark to Market   This is only one of the problems with the mortgage portfolios.      The other real problem, the mortgage processing companies convoluted what percent of each mortgage went to which CDO.&amp;amp;nbsp; Would you believe that some mortgages were divided up between CDOs?&amp;amp;nbsp; Yep.&amp;amp;nbsp; That&amp;#039;s right... a bookkeeping night mare in the back office.&amp;amp;nbsp; Add to that that some of the Bank processing companies have gone bankrupt and that the record keeping is fairly much shot, and you have a horrible game of &amp;quot;...catch me if you can...&amp;quot; going on.      It works this way... If homeowner xyz is behind on his bank loan by 3 payments, that mortgage has to be placed upon a watch list in order to satisfy the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency so that 60% of the loan has specific loan loss reserved scored to it.&amp;amp;nbsp; (4 months behind and the bank has to place the loan into Other Real Estate Owned and take title). Then that loan loss reserve has to also be given to the buyer of a particular CDO.&amp;amp;nbsp; But not only that, it has to be divided by the percentage of ownership that specific CDO has against it.      So, the owning bank suddenly HAS TO reserve capital for that particular loan based upon the scoring of that loan.&amp;amp;nbsp; Can you imagine if you own a billion bucks worth of CDO&amp;#039;s how you have to rebuild your loan loss portfolio each day?&amp;amp;nbsp; Think of the unique numbers of tiny fractions of loans you might own in addition to the mortgages you might own outright.      Now, add in your counter-party risk from your favorite insurer and mine, AIG.&amp;amp;nbsp; You send them a request for x dollars of insurance to cover your loss of capital for all of those CDOs.&amp;amp;nbsp; And then AIG gives you crap that they have no cash available until the Fed gives them the promised cash.... That&amp;#039;s enough to have your assistant take away all kitchen knives in the break room!!!!!      My friends, the reality of this situation upon the banks is simply a logarithmic function of the downturn of the real estate market.&amp;amp;nbsp; The more the real estate market has cratered, the more bookkeepers the banks have had to hire just to get back to knowing just how much money the bank has lost over night.&amp;amp;nbsp; Then, they have to walk the results up to the CFO that morning and tell him just how much capital has evaporated AND just how many deposits have run off over night from the prior day&amp;#039;s operation.      Lastly, you work in the Dept of the Treasury.&amp;amp;nbsp; You see the consolidated balance sheets of all banks deteriorating each night.&amp;amp;nbsp; You look at the handwriting on the wall, it says to look at the clock.&amp;amp;nbsp; You are running out of time.      If you&amp;#039;ve followed this post and understand it, you are a banking financial analyst wonk.&amp;amp;nbsp; If not, you are a congressman.      LOL.      Ford
