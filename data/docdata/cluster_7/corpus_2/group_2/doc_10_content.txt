RBA Joins Central Banks in Currency Swap        The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has joined four other central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, in setting up temporary reciprocal currency swap facilities to address elevated pressures in US dollar short term fundings markets.       The RBA said currency swap lines have been set up between itself, the Fed and the Denmark, Norway and Sweden central banks - Danmarks Nationalbank, Norges Bank and Sveriges Riksbank.      The Fed said in its statement that the swap lines it will have with the RBA, Denmark Norway and Sweden central banks represent a $US30 billion ($36.11 billion) addition to the $US247 billion ($297.3 billion) previously authorised temporary swap arrangements with other central banks announce earlier this month.      &amp;amp;quot;These facilities, like those already in place with other central banks, are designed to improve liquidity conditions in global financial markets,&amp;amp;quot; the RBA said in a statement, that was released simultaneously with a similar notice from the Fed.      &amp;amp;quot;Central banks continue to work together during this period of market stress and are prepared to take further steps as the need arises.&amp;amp;quot;      The RBA said it will have a foreign exchange swap facility with the Fed, to address pressures in US dollar short-term funding markets in the Asian time zone.      The RBA and the Fed have agreed on a $US10 billion swap line to provide US dollar liquidity in Australia, in exchange for Australian dollars.      &amp;amp;quot;The swap serves to alleviate a shortage of US dollar liquidity which has affected market participants around the world including in the Asia-Pacific time zone,&amp;amp;quot; the RBA said.      The US dollars will be made available, against collateral, to local market participants by the RBA through an auction.      The first of these auctions will be conducted on Friday.      The term of the initial swap will be 28 days.  Subsequent auctions will depend on market conditions.
