 The next domino to fall may be AIG which is facing credit rating downgrades that will force it to post more collateral (that it doesn&amp;amp;#8217;t have )on a large volume of credit insurance contracts. AIG is a much larger systemic threat than Lehman ever was, so this situation is profoundly serious.      Gold, short-term U.S. Treasuries, short-term Swiss and German government paper, the Swiss franc, and certain Asian currencies like the Singapore dollar are the safest places to park your cash for the moment.
