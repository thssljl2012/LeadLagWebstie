 Precious Metals Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Re: Coup......Inflation or not   Except that in terms of foreign debt inflation is the easiest way to repay it. Easier to repay with  the gazillions of new dollars then to part with any of the precious few if they do not inflate.  Inflation is the easiest way to eliminate that massive and still growing  debt.    That is not to say I do not see  your and BW&amp;#039;s points.     And BW yes I did see LIBOR last night double. No one was talking about it though like it never happened. It was a direct reaction to the fear that AIG will not be able to perform on all that deb they insured that is already not performing. Good deal for AIG though to collect 1% or so on $400B in loans and not have to actually cover any of them. CDS&amp;#039;s are pure fiction at this point and those with the money know it. And those holding the wrong end of the CDS are finding out quickly just how screwed they are. We have not heard from folks like CALPERS yet either. When pensions go bust because the Aaa rated securities they bought and even bought insurance on are worthless then what?  Nope AIG must not be allowed to fail.     Lastly the FED did please the market after all today as witnessed in the 200 point swing from down 50 to up 150 as soon as the rumor broke on AIG funding. In just mere minutes. There were as many crosses above and below the  line today as I remember ever seeing. Of course VIX was over 30 yesterday so that explains some of the volatility I suppose.      thread start
