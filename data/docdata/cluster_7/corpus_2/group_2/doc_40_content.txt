Wible reiterated his buy rating on the equity with a target price of $3.75.  We believe SIRIs recent stock performance is a reflection of auto weakness, credit issues, and diminishing consumer confidence. These overhanging issues have made it more difficult for investors to appreciate the SIRIs long term value, which we now quantify using terminal cash flow analysis, long term sub estimates, and leverage assumptions.  The analyst outlines three scenarios for investors to consider:  - Using a conservative 7x multiple on terminal cash flow per sub we believe SIRI would be worth $1.41 (20%penetration) in a worst case.  - The company could be worth up to $4.57 (50% penetration) in an aggressive case.  - A more realistic scenario (35% penetration by 2018) suggests that the stock is worth $3.00.  Wible does recognize near term issues that can weigh on the stock, identifying OEM sales and the re-financings as issues that give concern, but also as potential positives once auto sales turn around, and the refinancing happens. Wible has made a conservative assumption by calculating that the $300 mil due in Feb will be funded by an equity offering. He sees improvements in FCF due to merger synergies may put SIRI in a solid position to refinance the remaining $750 mil due later in 2009.            &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;nbsp; This is an ass making assumptions which are &amp;quot;conservative&amp;quot; assumptions. What a joke. Auto sales are not increasing and in fact decreasing as credit tightens. Moreover, obtaining new financing to replace the old financing is nothing more than a pipe dream. Each day that goes by makes Mel job to refinance even harder.  Businesses with good credit cannot borrow let alone companies that have been in business for years which have never shown a profit. Do not assume a profit in 2009 because even management has stated their will be a loss. Not even cash flow break even is projected. So far since the merger there has been a lot of talk of new products and interoperable receivers (even youdopey whatever was fooled posting about a non-existent interoperable receiver). Floor Hockey and Youdopey continue to pump the stock relying on analysts who have dead wrong on the stk for over 2 years. Only Goldman analyst was right yet he is castigated by the pumpers while the stk moves down in price. It is laughable pumpers are thrilled at siri rising to a dollar a share. Right now it is less than the price of taco. Where have the rest of the pumpers gone? Treyvia, Hugsan, of course Greg who is hiding out, serafi, etc. They were on the board every day when siri was $8. Now, the board is inhabited with a bunch of crazies discussing politics and letter writing to the President (as if he reads them). The stk is dead, long live the company in reorganization.
