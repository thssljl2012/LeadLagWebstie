  maybe I am, but, according to george&amp;#039;s news conference yesterday, the government is going to basically own these institutions and manage them until they get back on their feet, or, until the U.S, economy does. I agree about the borrowing too much, but it seems like there&amp;#039;s a great deal of bad paper floating around, in other words, lending institutions handed out money to make people homeowners and such, who really, honestly couldn&amp;#039;t afford it. as an insurance company, I don&amp;#039;t understand AIG&amp;#039;s pre-bankruptcy claim, or their losses. what losses? from claimants, or, bad investments?

What is going on with Fannie, Freddie, etc... is not a bailout or hand out or any giveaway of any kind. If anything, the government is taking advantage of the mismanagement of these companies and using the monitary strength of the USA to profit from these disasters.     The cause of the failures is excess leveraging. That is, borrowing too much as part of the business model and having too little reserve capital. It is a business model that always worked for banks when real estate valuations kept going up, but wont work at all when it is going down.     The trigger was a change in the so called fair value rule concerning FAS 157 that came about as part of the internationalization of the markets. In years prior, it was the entry price of the mortgage contract that set the value of the paper. That paper, along with thousands of others were to become the underlying assets of a bank for all kinds of accounting purposes. The new rules stipulate valueing the paper on a mark to market basis. In other words, the entry price and whether or not the mortgage holder was making payments on time, didn&amp;#039;t matter as much as what the current market value is. In a bad market, it spells disaster for banks with 30 to 1, loan to deposit ratios.     The government is getting the mortgages, most of which are still performing, all of which are backed by hard assets, for less than 20 cents on the dollar in some cases. They will hold them until the market improves and sell them at a profit for the taxpayers. It is not without risk. What if the economy never improves? How much of the toxic waste real estate is worth less than 20% of the loan value. These are unknowns. But, they will do all they can to make sure that they get their money back plus much more. As it plays out, the gov&amp;#039;t deficit may turn into a surplus AGAIN.     The last surplus had some to do with the bailout of the S&amp;amp;amp;L industry through the use of The Resolution Trust Corporation.     In short, what happens is that mortgage assets held by failed banks and others are nationalized. In the end, the taxpayer makes out like a bandit.
