The iShares FTSE NAREIT Mortgage REITs (REM:ishares) holds a portfolio of real estate investment trusts that invest in mortgages. The ETF had less than $30 million in its coffers late last week, but perhaps no other stock will provide a better gauge for confidence in the shaken mortgage market in coming months.   Separately, the fund also raises questions about the risks of single-stock concentration in sector ETFs.    REM is thinly traded, its volume jumped last Monday and the portfolio gained 6% on news the government was leading a bailout of troubled mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae    The ETF, which is managed by Barclays Global Investors, holds a portfolio of real estate investment trusts that invest in mortgages. According to BGI, nearly 29% of the portfolio is committed to just one stock: Annaly Capital Management Inc.

(MFA:mfa mtg invts inc com  News, chart, profile, more    Mortgage REITs are somewhat unique among real estate stocks. They don&amp;#039;t own property like other REITs, but rather they originate loans or invest in mortgage securities.   The companies borrow at lower, short-term rates and invest in longer-duration securities, and try to profit from the spread. In other words, their profitability is driven in large part by the yield curve. REITs are required to pay out most of their net income to shareholders in the form of dividends.   When the iShares FTSE NAREIT Mortgage REITs jumped on Monday, it benefited from its outsized weighting in Annaly, which rose 10% for the session.   Top heavy  The mortgage-REIT sector has been extremely volatile during the credit crunch and residential-housing bust. However, just one stock making up about 30% of an ETF should be red flag for investors who assume all sector ETFs are diversified.   The mortgage-REIT ETF is &amp;quot;in fact a huge bet on Annaly,&amp;quot; said Jim Wiandt, publisher of ETF research firm IndexUniverse.com.   &amp;quot;Having that level of concentration makes you wonder about your level of diversification,&amp;quot; he said.   BGI does point out that the ETF, which has an expense ratio of 0.48%, is classified as &amp;quot;non-diversified,&amp;quot; according to the prospectus.   &amp;quot;This means that the fund may invest a large percentage of its assets in securities issued by or representing a small number of issuers,&amp;quot; the prospectus reads. &amp;quot;As a result, the fund may be more susceptible to the risks associated with these particular issuers, or to a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence affecting these issuers.&amp;quot;   The fallout from the subprime mess has already claimed several mortgage REITs, including American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. and New Century Financial Corp.   The iShares FTSE NAREIT Mortgage REITs was itself a victim of bad timing as BGI launched the fund in May 2007, right into the teeth of the mortgage crisis. See previous ETF Investing.   Through Sept. 11, the ETF was off 29.5% so far in 2008, according to investment researcher Morningstar Inc.   Difficulties and consolidation  Although the assets in iShares FTSE NAREIT Mortgage REITs are down so far this year on brutal market action, the ETF has seen more than $22 million in net new money, signaling there is at least some investor interest in the fund, said Dina Ting, senior portfolio manager at BGI&amp;#039;s iShares.   She said the ETF is &amp;quot;still small&amp;quot; in dollar terms. Meanwhile, the volatility and a concentration in the top stocks are often &amp;quot;typical in any sector that is experiencing difficulty and seeing more consolidation.&amp;quot;   Part of the reason Annaly Capital has grown so large in the ETF is &amp;quot;a clearer demarcation between winners and losers&amp;quot; during the mortgage crunch. When the fund was launched in 2007, Annaly Capital was only about 15% of the portfolio.   &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s performed a lot better than its peers,&amp;quot; Ting said.   One reason is that the company&amp;#039;s portfolio is made up of relatively safer agency-issued mortgage securities with no exposure to subprime. Annaly Capital rose after the Fannie and Freddie bailout in part because it was a big holder of the government-sponsored enterprises&amp;#039; mortgage securities, the market for which has stabilized somewhat after the historic rescue.   Another factor why Annaly Capital is such a big holding is because the ETF is a &amp;quot;sub-sector&amp;quot; fund with just 23 stocks in the tracking benchmark. Still, the ETF provides &amp;quot;precise exposure&amp;quot; to investors who want to invest in the mortgage-REIT industry, Ting said.   However, the big weighting in Annaly Capital raises other issues beside diversification.   Regulated investment company rules, which are applicable to the ETF, require that no single issuer can account for more than 25% of assets on a quarterly basis, Ting said.   With Annaly Capital over the limit, the fund&amp;#039;s managers could be forced to sell at the next quarterly rebalance, which could trigger capital-gains distributions if the gains can&amp;#039;t be offset by losses elsewhere in the portfolio.
