  &amp;amp;nbsp;on the economy in response to the Genius&amp;#039; predictions of doom. First Lehman is in Chapter 11, a move that will enable them to sell off many of their viable and healthy subsidiaries. At the end of that process they will either survive on a much smaller scale or convert to Chapter 7.  Meanwhile the Dollar will continue to be a floating currency and will continue to be &amp;quot;valued&amp;quot; by comparisons to among other things Gold and foreign currencies.  Finally the price of oil, maybe the most important short term factor will determine our economy in the near and mid term future. My prediction 4-5 months ago was that if we do decide to drill oil will settle at the price that our own oil would cost us if we drilled or slightly lower in hopes of us not drilling(remember the oil producing countries are totally dependent on that revenue, they have no second source).  Oops, forgot to mention that Merrill Lynch sold for a premium because of their many highly valued subsidiaries.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  As of yesterdays close the dollar continues to strengthen and this morning oil continues to drop in the Asian markets.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Oops, the world isn&amp;#039;t ending yet. Oil down to 91 on the way to 60 while gold is down to 780 from highs over 1000 just a few months ago. Meanwhile Lehman is going to be bought by Barclays for the good pieces. The Euro is down again while the Yen is below the level that it was on the day the Genius posted. Oh well the good news is that harvin is expected to walk tomorrow.
