          Good job preservation of &amp;#039;capital&amp;#039; doesn&amp;#039;t matter   Hello Kmck,  Indeed! Providing RBS keep providing income, I will continue not to care about &amp;#039;capital&amp;#039; and continue to enjoy many peaceful night&amp;#039;s sleep :-)   What is puzzling me is why RBS&amp;#039;s share price is down so much. Check this out:    http://alphaville.ftdata.co.uk/lib/inc/getfile/2171.jpg   Now consider that RBS&amp;#039;s share price has already been hammered, and so since this comparison is &amp;#039;compared to market cap&amp;#039;, RBS have been pushed rather unfairly up the list. But as you can see, they do not really depend on the market for funding &amp;#039;all that much&amp;#039; for their size. They are still very much near the bottom of the list in terms of being dependent on market funding, which as we know, has been the killer for banks in recent days.   Barclays, for example, are in a much worse situation.  Or what about Banco Santander, supposedly the hero of the hour?   I don&amp;#039;t understand why people aren&amp;#039;t worrying about  those  banks right now. They&amp;#039;ve been busy gearing up as this crash takes place, while RBS have stepped away from the game entirely it seems and have been busy de-gearing. Look at barclays, playing for Lehman brothers, playing for BB as well. Look at Banco Santander, playing for AL, playing for BB (and getting it). Or look at LLOY, strapping a landmine to their chest.   Anyway, if I may make an observation. RBS&amp;#039;s share price has been this low before, a few months ago, and I didn&amp;#039;t particularly care then. So, why should I care now?   Months ago:  - RBS had a higher level of gearing on it&amp;#039;s assets/debts. - RBS had a lower amount of capital reserves (think the last few months of profits, and the cancelled dividend). - RBS had fewer joe-bloggs customers leaving their billions of deposits. - RBS had more competitors vying for profit. - RBS had more competitors trying to get a share of funds through the market. - RBS did not have the prospect of an all-you-can-eat mother-of-all-bailouts handout for the worst parts of their assets. - RBS did not have the convenient opportunity to pick up unlimited numbers of good quality staff at a cheap price.  It seems to me my that business, and hence my chances of a future income stream from this company, are in considerably better shape than they were before! :-)   Particularly they are in much better shape now, than they were when the share price was 600p, and the company had all the same risks but  crucially  was not aware of those risks . They are in  much better shape  than they were the last time the share price went down to 160p or 150p or 140p or whatever.   I continue to be more concerned with my income and my company&amp;#039;s earnings, than I am with the tantrums of the moody teenager we lovably call &amp;#039;the market&amp;#039;.   comp.
