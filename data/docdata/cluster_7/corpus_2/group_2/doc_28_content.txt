 NXG Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 5              Re: Comapnies with ARS - mixed picture   Prior to last CC sent Mr Stowe question on identity of companies that are the underlying bond payers to NXG and said I would ask Q at CC. Did not ask Q because Douglas notified us all that they were in arbitration suit with Lehman over whole situation.     Barclays now bought Lehman section that should have been involved with ARS transactions. Normally a buyer in BK tries to strip out underlying liabilities as it buys body parts. All subject to other creditors and Trustee approval.     3 items now are WHO are the underlying bond holders, are they still AAA, and are they in default on payments ? In addition is Barclays the successor defendant on ARS arbitration or did they fly the coop with Trustee approval ?     Write down may, or may not,occur depending on the underlying &amp;quot;AAA&amp;quot; rated payer of the debt. A bit more dicey but not hopeless for NXG.     Gotta give the tape painters at close credit. They work magic. Great volume again today. Volume preceeds price, preceeds news - yada yada.     Next we hear that Outer Mongolian bank is contributing to stabilizing US banks. What a farcical charade. This too shall end. Bear, Fannie, Freddie, lehman, Merill, AIG - who are they kidding ?       thread start
