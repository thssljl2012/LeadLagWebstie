They are actually standing up for their core beliefs here, somewhat admirable in todays politics.                      Basically, governments don&amp;#039;t have enough cash. Read an interesting article outlining this yesterday, here is a snippet if you care;         The crucial problem on this side of the Atlantic is that the largest European banks have become not only too big to fail, but also too big to be saved. For example, the total liabilities of Deutsche Bank (leverage ratio over 50!) amount to about 2,000bn (more than Fannie Mae) or more than 80 per cent of the gross domestic product of Germany. This is simply too much for the Bundesbank or even the German state, given that the German budget is bound by the rules of the European Unions stability pact and the German government cannot order (unlike the US Treasury) its central bank to issue more currency. Similarly, the total liabilities of Barclays of around 1,300bn (leverage ratio 60!) are roughly equivalent to the GDP of the UK.
