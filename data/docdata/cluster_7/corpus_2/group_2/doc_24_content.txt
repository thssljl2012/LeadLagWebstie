This means that 40% of all production must be replaced each and every year. If the price of NG is too low then many producers will curtail drilling. This off course ultimately leads to higher NG prices and then higher production. Aubrey McClendon thinks that the price point for balance is about $8. So your point about replacing production by producers is true as long as prices remain high enough.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    I&amp;#039;m not sure if $8 is the magic number but I believe there are plays that require high $7 and maybe $8 NG to be profitable. For UPL the price is among the lowest ($4.85, breakeven at 10% ROR). Not sure what the economics across all the plays are (and these are constantly changing) but there is a feedback loop of sorts which will keep prices high, possibly at least $8 and if they go higher, UPL probably should hedge...    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Regards,    Lou    &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;         thread start
