 Rise in CPI &#039;rules out more rate cuts&#039;   Updated: 14:54, Wednesday April 22, 2009      Australia&#039;s headline consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.1 per cent in the March quarter, for an annual rate of 2.5 per cent, the ABS said on Wednesday.      The CPI rose 0.1 per cent in the March quarter, for an annual rate of 2.5 per cent, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said on Wednesday.      The trimmed mean CPI rose 1.0 per cent in the March quarter, for an annual growth rate of 3.9 per cent.      The weighted median CPI rose 1.2 per cent in the March quarter, with an annual rise of 4.4 per cent.      Market economists had expected the average of the two underlying measures to rise by 0.8 per cent in the March quarter for an annual rate of 3.9 per cent.      The market consensus for the headline CPI was for a rise of 0.5 per cent in the March quarter, for an annual pace of 2.9 per cent.      ICAP economist Adam Carr said the rise meant the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would hold off on a rate cut for the next few months.      &#039;The trims and the weighted median are both one per cent plus,&#039; he said.      &#039;For an economy that&#039;s slowing we really should be seeing core inflation going in the other direction.&#039;      &#039;I don&#039;t think it will spark alarm bells, but in my view it rules out a near term rate cut.&#039;      In April the RBA cut interest rates to three per cent, a 49 year low.      The ABS calculates the trimmed mean and weighted median measures on behalf of the RBA, which uses them to gauge the underlying trend in inflation.      Unlike the headline CPI, the RBA&#039;s underlying measures are subject to revision due to the seasonal adjustment of some of their components.      UBS senior economist Matthew Johnson said: &#039;I think the RBA still have confidence that things will come down in due course,&#039; he said.      &#039;It&#039;s not going to encourage them to cut rates any faster.&#039;      &#039;The last thing the central bank wants is for inflation to be too high when recovery starts.      &#039;This number definitely tells me  ...
