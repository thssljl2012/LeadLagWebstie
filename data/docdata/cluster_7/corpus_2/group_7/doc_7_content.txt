Australian business conditions last quarter were the worse since the recession of the early 1990s, a survey showed on Thursday, and firms expected things to get even worse this year.     In findings sure to keep pressure on for more monetary and fiscal stimulus, National Australia Bank's (NAB) quarterly survey of business found export orders, capital expenditure plans and confidence all at record lows while job shedding gathered pace.     "Business is clearly positioning itself for tough times ahead," said NAB's chief economist Alan Oster. "That is particularly evident in employment, where labour shedding has been evident in the survey for some time."
