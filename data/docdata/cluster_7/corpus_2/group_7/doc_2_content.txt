 FRANKFURT, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has made it very clear it will pause with cuts in interest rates on Thursday, focussing financial markets on signals of how low the bank can go and the likely scale of a cut they now expect in March.  ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has said the next important policy meeting for the rate-setting council is not till next month, prompting analysts to virtually abandon hopes of a cut this week despite an ever gloomier economic backdrop.  Trichet and others have underlined the dangers of cutting rates to zero and, as recession engulfs much of the euro zone, economists say the bank will also need to explain clearly that it is not behind the curve.  "If they actually decided to cut rates immediately, that would be interpreted as a sign of emergency," said Bank of America economist Gilles Moec.  "It would indicate they are really scared and that is probably not the message they want to send right now. I would expect them to indicate even more clearly that we should expect something in March, and expect something quite significant." All but 3 analysts in a Reuters poll of 85 economists   expected the ECB to keep base borrowing costs at 2 percent on Feb. 5 after a 50 basis point cut at the Jan. 15 meeting.  But the same majority expected the bank to cut its headline rate in March, with most backing it to go to a record-low of 1.5 percent, before easing credit costs further to 1 percent by the end of June, where they would remain well into next year.  ...  And with little room to cut rates, analysts are starting to look what else central banks have in store, especially whether ECB would start to directly buy corporate debt.  "The real debate inside the ECB is not really about the interest rates, the real debate is whether the ECB will have to go to non-conventional measures," Natixis Chief Economist Patrick Artus said.   /...  http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idINL2760564...
