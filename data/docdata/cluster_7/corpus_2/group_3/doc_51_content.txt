  CBA confirms BankWest takeover talks    Posted 10 hours 30 minutes ago       The Commonwealth Bank (CBA) has confirmed it is in exclusive talks with British mortgage lender HBOS about a potential takeover of BankWest.      The Perth-based bank is owned by HBOS, which is the target of a UK government sponsored takeover by British bank, Lloyds TSB.      The Commonwealth Bank says no agreement has been reached yet on a possible deal.      A banking analyst says confirmation of the talks provides more certainty for BankWest.       The banking analyst from investment company Wilson HM, Brett Le Mesurier, says it is likely the Commonwealth Bank will pay up to $3 billion for BankWest.      &amp;quot;Commonwealth Bank like a number of the major banks will like to be stronger in West Australia, which is obviously where BankWest is located primarily,&amp;quot; he said.      &amp;quot;There is some additional business on the east coast but most importantly it is more west coat expansion.&amp;quot;      Mr Le Mesurier says it is a good deal for the Commonwealth Bank, even though it may have to raise capital to fund the purchase.       &amp;quot;It increases the size of the business, the loan book the Commonwealth Bank is likely to pick up is in the range of $50 to $60 billion, which would obviously add a meaningful amount to their Australian presence,&amp;quot; he said.      At around midday, Commonwealth Bank shares were down almost 2 per cent to $43.20.        http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2...07/2383898.htm        Does this mean the new bank west development at Raine Square will be stalled? or are they just the anchor tennant?
