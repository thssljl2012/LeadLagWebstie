 &amp;amp;quot;Do you know what the typical terms for the option ARM&amp;#039;s resetting is?&amp;amp;quot;  I do not, I only have the table from the Barclays study showing that the notes will increase to 60-80% when the recasts trigger starting around mid-2010. The problem is this. The recast mortgage value is typically 115% of the original value while real property value is down 20-30%. It is dificult to get that refinanced.  Even those who did not take the interest option and did not lose property value are seeing their notes increase significantly when the re-fi ranging around $100+ a month in good areas.
