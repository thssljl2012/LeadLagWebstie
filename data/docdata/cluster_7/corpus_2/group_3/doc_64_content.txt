Good Luck,    Peter    MLP report   http://www.gpcresearch.ml.wallst.com//common/emailLink/pdf.asp?SSS_CA144813DA413B159E4D0F0BF0FE03   10&amp;amp;pdf=pdf/NAT_GAS_PIPELINE_Where_high_yi.pdf      UBS on BGH/BPL  UBS Investment Research  Buckeye    3Q08 Earnings Hits the Mark  &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Earnings per unit (EPU) increase  Buckeye Partners (BPL) reported recurring 3Q08 EPU of $0.79 as compared to $0.71 in 3Q07. These results matched the $0.79 UBS estimate and were ahead of the $0.75 consensus estimate. Buckeye GP Holdings (BGH), owner of the BPL general partner, reported EPU of $0.26 versus $0.18 in 3Q07. Results matched our $0.26 estimate and were just below the $0.27 consensus estimate.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Terminals strength offsets pipeline weakness  Incremental earnings from the recent Albany terminal acquisition, increased ethanol blending and additive injection fees drove a sharp EBITDA increase at the terminalling and storage segment ($18.6mm in 3Q08 vs $10.8mm in 3Q07). These results offset lower EBITDA at the pipelines segment ($43.2mm in 3Q08 vs $45.8mm in 3Q07), which were driven by higher transmix cost and continued demand destruction.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Distributions increased at both entities  BPLs new distribution run rate of $3.50 per unit represents a 6.1% increase over the $3.30 run rate for 3Q07 and a 1.4% increase from the 2Q08 run rate of $3.45. BGHs new distribution run rate of $1.32 per unit represents a 20.8% increase over the $1.06 run rate for 3Q07 and a 3.2% increase from the 2Q08 run rate of $1.24.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Valuation: Ratings maintained; BPL PT trimmed and BGH PT unchanged  Our new BPL price target of $44 (from $48) incorporates higher risk (related to demand destruction) and is based on our distribution discount model. Our BGH price target remains at $17.      UBS on TPP  UBS Investment Research  Teppco Partners    3Q08 Update: Distribution Raised  &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Earnings per unit (EPU) decrease  TPP achieved 3Q08 EPU of $0.40 versus $0.44 in 3Q07. Results were below both UBS and consensus estimates of $0.45/$0.43. Lost revenue due to hurricane related disruptions totalled an estimated ~$3.7m.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Downstream dips  Downstream EBITDA fell ~23% as refined product volumes decreased by ~16% and more than offset tariff increases of ~5%. TPP believes the decrease was due to demand destruction, Hurricane Ike related supply constraints and unusually strong 3Q07 comps. This decrease more than offset the 29% increase in Upstream EBITDA and the addition of the Marine Services segment.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Distribution run-rate raised to $2.90 from $2.84  TPPs new distribution run-rate of $2.90 represents a 4.3% increase over 3Q07s run-rate of $2.78 and a 2.1% increase over 2Q08s run-rate of $2.84. With initial contributions from its new marine assets and organic projects expected to boost growth modestly, we believe TPP should be able to raise its distributions around 4% in 2009.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Valuation: Trimming 12-month price target to $33 (from $36)  Our new price target of $33 incorporates higher risk (related to demand destruction) and is based on our distribution discount model. Our price target implies a 9.2% yield on our 3Q09 target distribution run-rate $3.02 per unit, versus its peer group median of 7.6%.      Barclays  Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP (BWP): Solid Quarter, Raising Target Price    Stock Rating:    2-Equal weight    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Solid quarter affirms BWP&amp;#039;s ability to manage costs on new build while willingness of Loews to purchase additional equity greatly diminishes financing risks against current market backdrop. Increase target price to $25.50 from $24 reflecting increasing stability of franchise.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Solid 3Q results as yr/yr gains evidenced in earnings, EBITDA and distributable cash predominantly driven by new projects not in year ago results.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Our retooled forecast highlights company&amp;#039;s ability to finance remaining $1.8 billion of capex under revolver and GP-supported equity issuance without need to tap into capital markets after &amp;#039;09.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Trim distribution growth outlook to 6% from 8% in line with where we think &amp;#039;08 is heading. We have some degree of comfort as we&amp;#039;ve embedded some cushion around our assumptions with respect to interest rates (ex additional disruptions in the financial markets) and capital expenditures.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Revised price target predicated on units trading at target yield of 8% on a 12 month distribution run rate of $2.04.      Barclays  Buckeye Pipeline Partners (BPL): 3Q Modestly Above Expectations    Stock Rating:    3-Underweight    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Diversification of cash flows from recent acquisitions is helping BPL weather the weak macro backdrop. Our $43 price target is based on a 12-month distribution run rate of $3.66 (previously $3.68) and a target yield of 8.5%.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; 3Q EBITDA 3% above our estimates, as strength in the Terminals business more than offset lower-than-expected Pipelines results. Energy Services and Gas Storage were in line.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; BPL increased its quarterly distribution 6.1% YoY and 1.4% sequentially to $0.875 per unit ($3.50 annualized). The distribution will be paid Nov 28 to unitholders of record Nov 7. Due to weak capital markets and a slowdown in refined products demand, we are modestly lowering our 2009 distribution growth rate from 6% to 5%.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; The diversification of cash flows stemming from the natural gas storage and refined product marketing acquisitions in 2008 positively impacted 3Q results by moderating BPL&amp;#039;s heavy exposure to pipelines (though still the largest segment). Natural gas and marketing businesses posted higher EBITDA sequentially, while the pipeline business posted lower EBITDA      Barclays  Encore Energy Partners LP (ENP): Third Quarter Update    Stock Rating:    1-Overweight    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; ENP&amp;#039;s unit distribution could be negatively impacted by slumping oil prices during the fourth quarter before benefitting from its higher price oil hedges in &amp;#039;09. Units are yielding 12.7% based on our FY09 distribution estimate compared with a peer average of 19.4% reflecting the company&amp;#039;s stronger coverage ratios and operating performance.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Management estimates 4Q production in the range of 6.0-6.6 MBOE/d. LOE is expected to be $12.00-$13.00/BOE, down from $15.52 in 3Q.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Revising &amp;#039;08 EBITDA/DCF per unit ests. to $4.35/$3.65 from $4.85/$4.10.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Revising &amp;#039;09 EBITDA/DCF per unit ests. to $4.10/$3.30 from $3.35/$2.55.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Under the variable distribution formula, we estimate a 4Q distribution of $0.43, a decrease of 35% from the 3Q distribution of $0.66. For 2009, we estimate an annualized distribution of $2.25, an increase of 32% over the annualized 4Q08 rate, due in large part to the company&amp;#039;s hedges.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Oil floors currently cover approximately 90% of estimated &amp;#039;09 production at an average price of $100/bbl. We estimate ~55% of distributable cash flow next year is attributed to hedging gains. .      Barclays on HEP    Holly Energy Partners LP (HEP): Minimum Commitments Provide Stability    Stock Rating:    2-Equal weight    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; With the majority of cash flows supported by contractual minimum revenue commitments, HEP maintains a relatively low risk profile. However, risks still exist, in our view, including HEP&amp;#039;s small size and higher cost of capital. Our $34 price target is based on a 12-month distribution run rate of $3.19 and a target yield of 9.5%.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; 3Q distributable cash flow of $16 MM, up 15% YoY, was in line with our estimate, as minimum revenue commitments from Holly Corp and other refiners provide stability in weak macro backdrop.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; HEP raised its quarterly distribution 5.7% YoY and 1.3% sequentially to $0.755 per unit ($3.02 annualized). HEP has increased its distribution every quarter since 2004.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Given softer refined product demand, turbulent capital markets and a resulting higher cost of capital to finance growth, we are modestly lowering our 2009 distribution growth estimate from 7.5% to 5.5% to increase distribution coverage from 1.1x to 1.15x.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; We believe HEP stock, like many MLPs was oversold in early October. HEP has rallied 88% since hitting trough on 10/8 (vs. MLP Index up 41% and S&amp;amp;P 500 up 11% from trough).      UBS on Canadian Oil &amp;amp; Gas    UBS Investment Research  Canadian Oil &amp;amp; Gas    Material change to commodity outlook  &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; We see near term downside and prices averaging US$60/bbl in 2009  We cut our oil price forecast in half for the next few quarters and expect WTI futures will average US$100/bbl this year; US$60/bbl in 2009 and US$75/bbl in 2010  which is down 11%, 43% and 36% respectively from before. We also lowered our normalised prices by about US$10/bbl, to US$86/bbl in 2013 (money of the day). Our near term averages are below spot and 2008-09 are below futures and consensus.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Reducing 2009-10 and normalized natural gas price forecasts  Weve lowered our 2009-10 and normalized Nymex natural gas price forecasts to US$7.00/mcf, US$7.75/mcf, and US $8.00/mcf, respectively (down 18%, 14% and 11% respectively). Given expectations of lower industrial and electric demand in light of deteriorating economic conditions, lower near term prices are needed to throttle back drilling activity and production growth. Under our revised outlook for natural gas, we have reduced our normalized natural gas price by 11% to US$8.00/mcf.    &amp;amp;#65533;&amp;amp;#65533; Top picks  Within the large caps our top pic...
