       The credit crunch hits Main Street:  Capital One Ends Financing of N.Y., N.J. Car Dealers   By David Mildenberg and Mike Ramsey  Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Capital One Financial Corp., the lender that raised $200 million last month to cover future losses, will end financing of auto dealers&amp;#039; inventories in New Jersey and New York by the end of this month, a spokesman said.  Capital One will keep financing dealers in Louisiana and Texas, where it also has banking offices, said spokesman Steven Thorpe in an interview. ``It was a very difficult decision for us to make, but after weighing various factors we believe it was the right decision,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said. McLean, Virginia-based Capital One notified about 20 dealers who will be affected in August.  The decision will put pressure on new-car dealerships that already plan to shut as much as 40 percent of their outlets, according to an estimate by the National Automobile Dealers Association. As many as 600 may close or combine with other dealers, equal to about 3 percent of the total, said Paul Taylor, an economist at NADA.  ``It&amp;#039;s a defining moment when Capital One gives up the ghost,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Sheldon Sandler, chief executive officer of Bel Air Partners in Skillman, New Jersey, which advises the automotive retail industry. ``Banks are seeing the bottom fall out of the dealership business and they don&amp;#039;t want to be caught sitting there owning a bunch of Chevys, instead of getting cash.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  Dealers that sell cars from General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC are having the most difficult time receiving financing, said Sandler. Dealers are paying higher interest rates to get cars on their lots, shrinking profit margins, he said. JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp;amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp. remain leaders in providing financing to auto dealers, he said.  `Captive&amp;#039; Financiers  The banks&amp;#039; commitment to so-called floorplan, or wholesale lending ``has been inconsistent,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Brian Johnson, an analyst with Barclays Capital Inc. in Chicago. ``The pressure comes back to the captive finance companies to pick up the slack.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  Most floorplan lending comes from captive financing units already. GMAC, General Motors Corp.&amp;#039;s financing group, provided 77 percent of such dealer financing in the first half of 2008, said GMAC spokeswoman Gina Proia.
