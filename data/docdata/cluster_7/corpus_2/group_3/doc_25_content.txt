Units are yielding 12.7% based on our FY09 distribution estimate compared with a peer average of 19.4% reflecting the company&amp;#039;s stronger coverage ratios and operating performance.                                   &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56451;     Management estimates 4Q production in the range of 6.0-6.6 MBOE/d. LOE is expected to be $12.00-$13.00/BOE, down from $15.52 in 3Q.                                   &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56451;     Revising &amp;#039;08 EBITDA/DCF per unit ests. to $4.35/$3.65 from $4.85/$4.10.                                   &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56451;     Revising &amp;#039;09 EBITDA/DCF per unit ests. to $4.10/$3.30 from $3.35/$2.55.                                   &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56451;     Under the variable distribution formula, we estimate a 4Q distribution of $0.43, a decrease of 35% from the 3Q distribution of $0.66. For 2009, we estimate an annualized distribution of $2.25, an increase of 32% over the annualized 4Q08 rate, due in large part to the company&amp;#039;s hedges.                                   &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56451;     Oil floors currently cover approximately 90% of estimated &amp;#039;09 production at an average price of $100/bbl. We estimate ~55% of distributable cash flow next year is attributed to hedging gains.
