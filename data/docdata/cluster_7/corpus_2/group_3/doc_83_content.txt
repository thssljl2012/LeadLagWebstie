         Most tracker mortgages do state that they follow the particular bank&amp;#039;s base rate, e.g. with mine it says &amp;#039;Barclays Base rate&amp;#039;. The bank base rate is not the same as the BOE base rate but I believe for technical reasons it is pretty much the same thing because it relates to the relationship between the BOE and the bank, unlike LIBOR which relates the to relationship between banks.  My mortgage states the rate change occurs the month after the base rate changes, so on Nov 1st my mortgage rate will change. My lifetime base rate tracker is 0.17 over base rate so I shall be a bit upset if I&amp;#039;m paying more than 4.67%  A lot of trackers have some interest rate floor - I haven&amp;#039;t checked but I believe mine is 3% - ie even if the base rate drops to 2.5% i shall still be paying 3%.  Hope this helps...
