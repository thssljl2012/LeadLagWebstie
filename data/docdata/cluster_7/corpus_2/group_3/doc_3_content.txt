          Well Barclay&amp;#039;s does have approximately that amount of debt, but it is nothing compared to the relationship of other banks to soverign nation GDP. For example, Kaupthing&amp;#039;s was estimated at over 500% of Icelandic GDP (source: Credit Suisse). I&amp;#039;m deliberately picking quotes from late 2006/early 2007 on purpose to highlight many commentators pointing out Iceland&amp;#039;s problems with foresight. And the large UK banks don&amp;#039;t really have the same extent of Iceland&amp;#039;s bank wholesale funding requirements.   But the UK has a lot more banks - add HSBC + RBS + Barclays + STandard Chartered + HBOS + Lloyds + A&amp;amp;amp;L + B&amp;amp;amp;B etc and all of a sudden you get to the same kind of number as Iceland. Kaupthing did indeed have 500% of GDP, but then Iceland essentially only has 3 banks and Kaupthing was massive compared to the other two.  The UK certainly does have similar stats re wholesale funding - especially before the crisis kicked off. Thats exactly the reason why Northern Rock, Alliance &amp;amp;amp; L and B&amp;amp;amp;B are no longer with us and why HBOS got worrying. Only Glitnir had a pretty high reliance on wholesale funding of the 3 Icelandics.   Not really, Kaupthing were riskier than Landsbanki - you&amp;#039;ve already said that yourself in previous post, whereas HSBC are the &amp;amp;quot;safest&amp;amp;quot; of the UK banks by a margin.   Sorry will have to agree to disagree then. Any UK problem means that foreign governments can seize UK assets now as the UK has done exactly that to another state.   If you&amp;#039;re asking me whether UK bank assurances are safe: no I don&amp;#039;t. I think we&amp;#039;re seriously screwed... but Iceland was the worst example and the first to fall, the Northern Rock of soverign states... ;)    But NR was the first to fall. The Icelandic banks are about numbers 12, 14 and 15 as far as I&amp;#039;m aware.  Unless of course you&amp;#039;re suggesting that the Icelandic state is to default, in which case would be great if you could explain how, I&amp;#039;d be really interested.  B
