       The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut official interest rates by 100 basis points to 6 percent in an effort to shield the Australian economy from further fallout from the global financial crisis. The central bank may make further cuts by Christmas, economists believe.  It was the first 100 basis point easing since May 1992 and surprised financial markets, which had expected a 50 basis point cut.
