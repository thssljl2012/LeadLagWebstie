 I would check with barclays, but with an offset the mortgage reserve should be at the same rate(mine is) as the mortgage     Reducing the interest on debts is a good idea as long as your budget is under control(which it may not be because of the debts) and you don&amp;#039;t extend the term of the debts which you don&amp;#039;t plan to do.     I would set up a budget that uses just your normal income still paying the 700pm towards the increased loan, then use the full bonus to attack the debts and the mortgage.     I would have a good look at your annual budget and spends.  80k gross for the year must be over 4.3k pm after debt payments going out that leaves over 2k I would review what you spend it on since you say you are spending even more than that(savings are going down).     Check the loan for any penalties no point in moving it and paying interest twice.      Make sure there is no PPI on the loan or CC&amp;#039;s.     At the end of the day when offsetting using the morgage reserve or offset savings makes no difference you just increase the net debt if you are spending more money than is coming in.      How much have saving gone down and debts gone up in the last 18month if it is more than 9k then you cannot be just the treatement. what happened to this years bonus? why can&amp;#039;t the full 9k(15k less tax) in Jan be used to tackle debt?     Your problem is probably that the budget is not under control if your net debt has been increasing for the last 18months.   Reducing the interest rates on $20k debt will not save that much. (probably less than 200pm depending on the loan) so you will probably need to cutback as well.     You could also consider getting a cheaper car to reduce debt further.     CONSOLIDATION only works if the budget is under control.
