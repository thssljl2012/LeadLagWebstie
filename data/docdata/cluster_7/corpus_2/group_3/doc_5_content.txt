         From what I saw, AMD was expected to lose $0.40 EPS.  Take $0.07, subtract $0.31 from the licensing deal, and you get -$0.24, which still is a significant beat.  Then add in $0.18 from non-recurring charges on discontinued stuff (if you&amp;#039;re going to subtract the $0.31, you also have to add back in the already subtracted $0.18) and AMD&amp;#039;s actual loss was pretty darned small compared to what it was supposed to be.   http://seekingalpha.com/article/100358-advanced-micro-device...    Tim Luke - Barclays Capital  Is it fair to think then in looking for flat revenue for the calendar fourth quarter that the graphics business would be expected to show some sequential growth within that? Or how should we think about the different segments for the fourth quarter?  Bob Rivet  We are just being cautious at this point. I mean with what is going on in the banking, financial markets, what we are seeing in rates in the first part of October we are just being cautious. As Dirk said though, we expect to continue to gain share in the GPU space and continue to gain share in the CPU space. So, but it is a little bit hard to call exactly what the numbers are going to finally land at.   The margins were up, Shanghai is shipping and in volume, and AMD is forecasting conservatively.  Those are all characteristic of AMD&amp;#039;s good times (better margins, conservative forecasts, substantial new CPUs launching on time).    Yes, they are spinning it for all they&amp;#039;re worth.  They want to convince everybody that they&amp;#039;ll be solid and around so it&amp;#039;s safe to buy AMD products.  And I think that some of this quarter&amp;#039;s bad news got into last quarter so Dirk would have a cleaner slate.  But margins are margins; 45 nm is going to reduce costs (they said they are STILL shipping some 90 nm Opterons, and they said they will be fully converted to 45 nm in the first half next year); The Foundry Co. deal is going to cut out a LOT of debt overhead.  AMD needs something to go right (Shanghai, Fusion, or the lawsuit) for them to make any decent amount of money, but I think they may well break even.    I am still displeased that there was no mention of Fusion in the CC, but they repeated several times that the analyst meeting is in 30 days and they will cover a lot of next year&amp;#039;s stuff then.
