WELLINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters) - New Zealand&amp;#039;s central bank slashed interest rates by a record one percentage point to 6.5 percent on Thursday, and said it was likely to lower them further amid slowing growth and financial market turmoil.    It was the third time the bank had cut interest rates after reductions in July and September totalling 75 basis points.    Twelve of 16 economists in a Reuters poll had expected the central bank to cut rates by 100 basis points to 6.5 percent, with the other four picking a 75 basis point cut.    ***********************************  ******************************    KEY POINTS:    - Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) says global turmoil and deteriorating outlook main reasons for cut.    - RBNZ says scale and timing of further rate cuts will depend on reduced domestic inflation and global events.    - RBNZ sees inflation falling back into target 1-3 pecent band by mid-2009, but domestic inflation &amp;#039;stubbornly high&amp;#039;.    - RBNZ sees lower export demand, credit less available, making consumers and businesses more cautious.    - Click on for official text.    COMMENTARY:    ADAM CARR, SENIOR ECONOMIST, ICAP    &amp;#039;The cut was expected. However I was a little surprised by their statement because it&amp;#039;s kind of suggesting to me that they&amp;#039;ll hold steady from here. They said in the statement they&amp;#039;re waiting to see evidence of actual reductions in domestic cost pressures. They&amp;#039;re not really going to get that till the next CPI print, which I believe is in January next year. So that suggests to me that unless we see a massive deterioration in the credit crisis, that they&amp;#039;ll be on hold until they see the actual evidence.&amp;#039;    &amp;#039;It&amp;#039;s fair to say they&amp;#039;ve made a significant downward revision to their inflation forecast, now expecting inflation to be within the band by mid-next year, as opposed to averaging still well above the band in the second half of next year. But they want to be sure. So I think the balance of probabilities points to an on hold RBNZ for the rest of this year.&amp;#039;    KHOON GOH, SENIOR ECONOMIST, ANZ-NATIONAL BANK    &amp;#039;It was an unprecedented move, but the bank has cut in line with expectations and flagged an easing bias.    &amp;#039;The Reserve Bank gave a timely reminder that inflation is still their focus and they continue to remain concerned about stubbornly high domestically generated inflation.    &amp;#039;We continue to see further easings ahead, but the market shouldn&amp;#039;t lose sight of inflation concerns just yet.&amp;#039;    HAYDEN ATKINS, ECONOMIST, MACQUARIE:    &amp;#039;It was widely expected that they would cut by 100 points. And they said that there&amp;#039;s more to come and they expect to see inflation come within that 1-3 (percent) target band by mid-next year. So there&amp;#039;s plenty of scope to continue to drop rates.    &amp;#039;They have mentioned it&amp;#039;s all contingent on inflation coming down. So they&amp;#039;re still reiterating that inflation focus and that will be important. But it is clear that things are softening and there is greater scope for more rate cuts to come.&amp;#039;    BRENDAN O&amp;#039;DONOVAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, WESTPAC &amp;#039;(Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard) has played with a pretty straight bat, he&amp;#039;s recognised the world&amp;#039;s going into recession and inflation pressures are likely to abate very quickly.&amp;#039;    ROBIN CLEMENTS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, UBS    &amp;#039;Well done for meeting the market. I had a fear that disappointment would not be the sort of thing you&amp;#039;d want in this environment.    &amp;#039;The focus is on global developments as you&amp;#039;d expect, and the impact on the New Zealand economy.    &amp;#039;There will be further cuts, the next question will be how much and how far.&amp;#039;    NICK TUFFLEY, ECONOMIST, ASB    &amp;#039;It was prudent of the RBNZ to meet market expectations. They are also delivering a few reminders that they do still care about inflation.&amp;#039;    MARKET REACTION:    The New Zealand dollar rose after the rate cut to around $0.5924 from around $0.5836 previously, with the 1 percentage point cut already fully factored in by investors.

The RBNZ is required to keep headline inflation between 1-3 percent over the medium term.    - The latest Reuters poll has a median expectation that the cash rate will be 6.25 percent by the end of the year and 5.5 percent by the middle of 2009.    - The RBNZ will next review rates on Dec. 4    .    ng    COPYRIGHT    Copyright Thomson Financial News Limited 2008.
