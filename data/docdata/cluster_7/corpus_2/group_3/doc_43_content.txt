The banking giant is currently conducting a share placement to institutional investors with a price range of between $38 and $43 a share.  This compares with CBA&amp;amp;#039;s closing price on Tuesday of $45.15. The bank&amp;amp;#039;s shares were placed in a trading halt before the Australian Stock Exchange opened today.  The placement of up to 52.6 million shares, which is being led by Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, Citigroup and CommSec, is expected to raise $2 billion, market sources said.  The bookbuild is expected to be finalised later today.  &amp;amp;quot;The strong geographical and business synergies make BankWest an attractive acquisition for us,&amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039; CBA chief executive Ralph Norris said.  &amp;amp;quot;BankWest provides us with a significant opportunity to further enhance the group&amp;amp;#039;s business in the fast-growing Western Australia market,&amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039; he said.  Mr Norris said he remained committed to BankWest&amp;amp;#039;s West Australian network and jobs, however the bank&amp;amp;#039;s east coast rollout would be placed under review.  He said BankWest would continue to operate as a stand-alone entity.  Pitched at around book value analysts said the acquisition makes sense in the current environment, allowing CBA to expand its footprint.  Mr Norris told reporters the acquisition of BankWest did not preclude CBA from acquiring the banking operations of Suncorp Metway.  The sale comes after HBOS&amp;amp;#039;s shares slid 40% on Tuesday, leading a broad-based sell-off in British banks, as the British Government prepared to announce a rescue package for its crippled financial sector.  &amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039;It&amp;amp;#039;s certainly an attractive price, indicating some distress and willingness to sell. CBA&amp;amp;#039;s definitely got an attractive deal,&amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039; said Mark Nathan, a portfolio manager at Fortis Investment Partners.  CBA, Australia&amp;amp;#039;s second-largest bank, also said it had had exploratory talks with Suncorp-Metway, which operates the country&amp;amp;#039;s sixth-biggest bank, but added that it was not currently involved in a sales process.  &amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039;It does set an indicative benchmark price for what Suncorp&amp;amp;#039;s worth,&amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039; said Nathan.  CBA&amp;amp;#039;s purchase of BankWest, at 20% below book value, looks cheap compared to Westpac&amp;amp;#039;s takeover of St George Bank at 2.7 times book value.  &amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039;The Commonwealth Bank regularly reviews acquisition opportunities but rarely have we seen a quality asset such as BankWest become available on such attractive terms to us,&amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039; Ralph Norris, Commonwealth&amp;amp;#039;s chief executive said.  Like many other lenders around the world hit by the global credit crisis, British banks are scrambling to raise funds to shore up ailing balance sheets. HBOS has accepted a British government-backed takeover bid from rival Lloyds TSB Group.  Suncorp on Monday revealed it had received approaches for its banking and wealth management businesses. CBA has been tipped as a front runner to buy the assets. Analysts believe CBA could afford both.  &amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039;We think so. They&amp;amp;#039;re raising funds for this, so they still maintain a very strong Tier 1 ratio and capital position. They remain well placed to consider a Suncorp opportunity,&amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039; Macquarie analyst Ben Zucker said.  The acquisition of BankWest would boost CBA&amp;amp;#039;s earnings per share immediately, and create annual pre-tax cost synergies estimated to be at 20-25% of BankWest&amp;amp;#039;s cost base, CBA said.  The deal, expected to be completed end January 2009, did not require HBOS or CBA shareholder approval, but would depend on regulatory approvals.  &amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039;We can&amp;amp;#039;t preempt the outcome, but expect any issues that would emerge can be overcome,&amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039; a CBA spokesman said.  CBA&amp;amp;#039;s shares have fallen about 24% so far this year, caught up in a broader sell off of financial stocks due to the global credit crisis.  Consolidation expected  Consolidation in Australia&amp;amp;#039;s banking sector has been widely expected as its big four players bulk up to weather the financial market turmoil.  Westpac, Australia&amp;amp;#039;s fourth-biggest bank, is close to acquiring the No. 5 bank St George, while Suncorp&amp;amp;#039;s banking division is another target.  CBA would also acquire HBOS&amp;amp;#039;s life insurance and wealth management business in Australia, St Andrews, but not its other Australian businesses, Capital Finance Australia Ltd, BOS International (Australia) Ltd and HBOS&amp;amp;#039;s Australian Treasury operations.  BankWest has 860,000 customers, mostly in Western Australia state which has been growing fast on the back of a mining boom. It also been expanding its retail banking operations in the more populous eastern Australian markets.  In the same statement, CBA said it had marked down its holding of notes in troubled childcare operator ABC Learning Centres, which would detract $100 million from its net profit in its fiscal 2009.
