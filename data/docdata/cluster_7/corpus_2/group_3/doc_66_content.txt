         Somehow with most of America following the governments spending habits and going into debt personally they now think the consumers in America are going to go out and put more things on credit cards like them again.  C&amp;#039;mon boys that is what got us in this hole to start with is over spending your limits!!!  Geez they still don&amp;#039;t get it.      Economic concerns brewing    While some observers are hoping the government&amp;#039;s steps to contain the financial crisis will lift the economy in coming months, the data is grim, for the present.       September retail sales fell 1.2%, the Commerce Department reported this morning, as consumers were sidelined by the credit freeze, higher jobless rates and a freefall in the stock market. The number was far worse than the 0.7% economists had expected.      Excluding autos, retail sales fell 0.6%, also worse than the expected decline of 0.2% last month.      &amp;amp;quot;Firms and consumers will likely postpone projects and large purchases until they better understand the implications of the current situation,&amp;amp;quot; said Christiian Broda, an economist at Barclays Capital, to Bloomberg News. &amp;amp;quot;Business and consumer paralysis is today&amp;#039;s main risk.&amp;amp;quot;
