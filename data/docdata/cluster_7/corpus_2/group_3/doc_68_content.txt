       Euro Money-Market Rates Rise to Records on Bailout-Plan Concern  By Justin Carrigan  Oct. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Money-market rates in Europe rose to records on concern the U.S. government&amp;#039;s $700 billion financial- rescue package will fail to revive confidence among banks, exacerbating an unprecedented seizure in lending.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, that banks charge each other for three-month loans increased to an all-time high of 5.34 percent today, the European Banking Federation said. The Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of cash scarcity among banks, widened to a record and Asian bank rates climbed to the highest levels in at least nine months.  ``It feels like the financial-sector problems are snow- balling, developing momentum that will be hard to stop,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Greg Gibbs, director of currency strategy at ABN Amro Holding NV in Sydney. ``The further deterioration in term bank-funding costs and spread widening even as policy makers in the U.S. are poised to pass a rescue bill is worrying.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  The world&amp;#039;s financial institutions are refusing to offer each other loans for any longer than a day even as central banks pump record amounts of cash into money markets. The U.S. House of Representatives will consider a package of measures today that would remove tainted assets from bank balance sheets.  The Libor-OIS spread, the difference between the three- month dollar rate and the overnight indexed swap rate, climbed to 273 basis points today. It&amp;#039;s the third consecutive day the spread has risen to an all-time high. The average was 8 basis points in the 12 months to July 31, 2007, before the credit squeeze began.  Cash Auctions  The European Central Bank, which said today it will allow more banks to participate in its unscheduled cash auctions, sold $50 billion of three-day loans. The Bank of England offered $30 billion of one-week funds and $10 billion in overnight loans. The Bank of Japan pumped in 800 billion yen ($7.6 billion) and the Reserve Bank of Australia added A$1.57 billion ($1.2 billion).  ``The Bank of Japan will have to continue injecting money into the market,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Yuuki Sakurai, general manager of financial and investment planning in Tokyo at Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance Co., which manages the equivalent of $54 billion in assets. ``There is a limit to what the BOJ can do, as a lot of investors are avoiding foreign banks at the moment.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  The U.S. Senate voted two days ago by 74 to 25 to approve an amended bill that would give the Treasury as much as $700 billion to buy distressed debt from financial companies. The House rejected an earlier version of the legislation on Sept. 29 by 228 to 205 votes. It&amp;#039;s scheduled to consider the version passed by the Senate today.  Central Bank Rates  The likelihood that the squeeze will push the global economy into a recession has made it more probable central banks will cut interest rates. Futures on the Chicago Board of Trade showed a 94 percent chance the Federal Reserve will reduce its target rate by a half-percentage point at its Oct. 29 meeting, up from no chance a week ago. The odds that the ECB will lower rates at its next meeting climbed to 98 percent, from 22 percent a week ago, a Credit Suisse Group index of derivatives showed.  Hong Kong&amp;#039;s three-month interbank rate rose 2 basis points to 3.81 percent today, and Tokyo&amp;#039;s increased 1 basis point to 0.87 percent, both the highest since December. Singapore&amp;#039;s rate for U.S. dollar loans climbed 11 basis points to 4.27 percent, the most expensive since Jan. 11.  ``The interbank lending market remains clogged up as banks hoard cash,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Joshua Williamson, a senior strategist at TD Securities in Sydney. ``Funding pressures look likely to remain high and the longer they stay up there the greater the chance banks will pass on those costs to clients.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, that banks charge each other for three-month dollar loans climbed to 4.21 percent yesterday, the highest since Jan. 11. The corresponding rate for euros advanced to a record 5.32 percent.  Libor&amp;#039;s Reach  Libor, set before noon in London every day after a survey conducted by the British Bankers&amp;#039; Association, determines prices for financial contracts valued at $393 trillion as of Dec. 31, influencing consumer interest rates on everything from home loans to credit cards. Euribor, a survey of 37 banks on the cost of borrowing euros, is fixed by the European Banking Federation about two hours earlier.  Interbank rates have soared for a third week as governments in Europe and the U.S. rescued at least six financial institutions in the past five days. Writedowns and losses around the world have surpassed $588 billion since the start of last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The difference between what banks and the U.S. Treasury pay to borrow money for three months, the so-called TED spread, was at 351 basis points today. The spread was 113 basis points a month ago.
