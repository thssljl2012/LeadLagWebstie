Yesterday&amp;#039;s rate reduction prompted Australia&amp;#039;s four biggest banks, led by Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp., to cut their standard variable home loan rates by 80 basis points.  That will reduce the monthly repayments on an average A$250,000 ($177,000) mortgage by almost A$140. About 90 percent of Australian home buyers have variable interest-rate loans that traditionally move with the central bank&amp;#039;s benchmark.  Australia&amp;#039;s economy grew 0.3 percent in the three months through June, the slowest quarterly expansion since the end of 2004, as consumer spending contracted for the first time since 1993.  Credit provided by banks and financial institutions to home buyers rose 0.4 percent in August, the smallest monthly increase in 22 years, according to Reserve Bank figures.
