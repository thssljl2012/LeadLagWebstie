          your point about it being unusual is interesting. The &amp;amp;quot;accepted view&amp;amp;quot; is that investment in stocks should be for the long term (accepted by respectable people, that is). However, the &amp;amp;quot;long term&amp;amp;quot; is not usually quantified, and it seems to be becoming longer. I suspect that shares have been overvalued for quite a long time and that a realistic appraisal of their value on P/E ratios would have led to lower values.    Actually the standard study in this area is one by Barclays that looks at every 5 year period since 1918. Don&amp;#039;t have a link but guess it can be found......  ....and now it can be shown that, indeed, the past is no guide to the future! ;-)  ee
