         Drillbit,  Thanks again for your response. It does look as though conventional Gilts might be the most suitable for my needs, although I&amp;#039;m tempted to add a few Barclays 9% Perps. Trouble is, Perps already account for about 20% of by SIPP and I&amp;#039;m not sure a higher allocation would be the right move in the current environment. Clearly the UK and most of the rest of the world are either in or heading for a serious recession, but it&amp;#039;s what come after recession that worries me more. Most governments are already taking some sort of action to get their economies growing again, and more concerted action will probably follow. This eventually could lead to a period of world economic growth and the risk of higher inflation, in which case the longer-dated index linked Gilts could make sense. But then I probably won&amp;#039;t be around by the time this comes to pass, so maybe a few more Perps yielding 10% will be okay.
