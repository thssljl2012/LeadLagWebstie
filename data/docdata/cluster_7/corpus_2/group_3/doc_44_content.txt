The slowdown will make it harder to further reduce poverty that&amp;#039;s fallen to its lowest levels since before the ``Lost Decade&amp;#039;&amp;#039; of the 1980s in which countries borrowed more than they could repay.    The crisis will test Latin America&amp;#039;s decade-old commitment to debt reduction and open markets. Mexico this week shelved plans to privatize an airport, citing the U.S. crisis, while Costa Rican President Oscar Arias warned the country&amp;#039;s growth rate may halve as investment drops. In Brazil, lending that has powered the country&amp;#039;s fastest expansion in more than a decade is drying up, said Ricardo Espirito Santo, head of the Brazilian unit of Portugal&amp;#039;s Banco Espirito Santo SA.    ``The last four or five years were very good for Latin America, but that cycle is coming to an end,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Rodrigo Valdes, chief Latin America economist at Barclays Capital in New York. ``We expect a deceleration in practically all economies.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;    Cutting Forecasts    Brazilian economists lowered 2009 growth projections to 3.6 percent on Sept. 26, from 4 percent two months earlier, according to a central bank survey. JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. cut its forecast for Latin America&amp;#039;s largest economy to 3.2 percent from 3.8 percent.    Mexico, the second-biggest economy, may expand 2.5 percent next year, according to the average estimate of 33 economists surveyed by the central bank, which released its report yesterday. They had previously forecast 3 percent.        http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;amp;refer=home&amp;amp;sid=aeWRhkAoaDlE
