(SXL): Solid 3Q, 10% &amp;#039;09 Guidance Reaffirmed                                                                        Stock Rating:                                                   3-Underweight                                                 &amp;amp;nbsp;                                &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56451;     Combining solid 3Q results and reaffirmation of 10% 2009 distribution growth guidance, SXL is navigating the weak refined products and macro environment. Our $50 price target is based on a 12-month distribution run rate of $4.16 and a target yield of 8.25%.                                   &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56451;     3Q EBITDA 4% above our estimates, driven primarily by strength in the Western Pipeline business with a contribution from modestly better-than-expected Eastern Pipeline biz more than offsetting lower-than-expected Terminal results.                                   &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56451;     SXL increased its quarterly distribution 13.5% YoY and 3.2% sequentially to $0.965 per unit ($3.86 annualized). The bump is at the high end of crude oil/refined products peers in 3Q. The distribution will be paid Nov 14 to unitholders of record Nov 7.                                   &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56451;     Importantly, SXL reaffirmed its prior guidance of 10% YoY distribution growth in 2009, despite capital market and macro headwinds. Visibility into 2009 growth prospects is supported by expected contributions from the $200 MM MagTex refined product pipeline and terminals acquisition (expected to close 4Q08) and the $90 Nederland terminal expansion (phased-in service expected to start mid-2009).
