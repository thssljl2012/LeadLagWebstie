           Yeah but the UK is also at an extreme level compared to &amp;#039;other European economies&amp;#039;. Barclays alone has leverage of about 100% of UK GDP.... It&amp;#039;s basically all very easy with hindsite is the problem.   Well Barclay&amp;#039;s does have approximately that amount of debt, but it is nothing compared to the relationship of other banks to soverign nation GDP. For example, Kaupthing&amp;#039;s was estimated at over 500% of Icelandic GDP (source: Credit Suisse). I&amp;#039;m deliberately picking quotes from late 2006/early 2007 on purpose to highlight many commentators pointing out Iceland&amp;#039;s problems with foresight. And the large UK banks don&amp;#039;t really have the same extent of Iceland&amp;#039;s bank wholesale funding requirements.   For example another way to look at it is that if say HBOS went under it would give the Chinese the right to seize the Chinese assets of HSBC to protect Chinese interests.   Not really, Kaupthing were riskier than Landsbanki - you&amp;#039;ve already said that yourself in previous post, whereas HSBC are the &amp;amp;quot;safest&amp;amp;quot; of the UK banks by a margin.  If you&amp;#039;re asking me whether UK bank assurances are safe: no I don&amp;#039;t. I think we&amp;#039;re seriously screwed... but Iceland was the worst example and the first to fall, the Northern Rock of soverign states... ;)
