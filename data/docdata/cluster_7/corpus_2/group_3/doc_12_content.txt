Duncan is debt capital markets editor for Financial News, a Dow Jones publication and contributor to Deal Journal.     The banks underwriting the $55 billion loan backing miner BHP Billitons hostile bid for rival Rio Tinto will have to delay the full sale of the jumbo financing until next year, placing greater strain on their balance sheets at a time when banks are trying to shed risk and reduce their credit exposure to the corporate sector.    BHP Billiton won regulatory approval on Wednesday from Australias competition watchdog for its proposed $114 billion bid for Rio Tinto. But further syndication of the $55bn loan will remain on hold until the completion of the European Commissions first in-depth review of the transaction in January, according to bankers working on the deal.    The delays means that large chunks of the jumbo financing will have to remain on the balance sheets of the lead arrangers and bookrunners Barclays Capital, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Santander and UBS as well as the nine sub-underwriting banks that agreed to support the deal in April.    Banks are trying to syndicate or sell about $100bn of investment-grade loans backing mergers and acquisitions in the corporate sector this year, but Lehman Brothers filing for bankruptcy protection and widespread volatility has all but paralysed the loan market, delaying loan sales and placing strain on banks balance sheets.       While BHPs banks will have to hold the loan on their balance sheets until January, the loan will still be available to the company, but is expected to remain undrawn over the end of the year. This, according to banker close to the deal, should attract a more beneficial capital weighting given BHPs investment-grade rating.    The regulatory approval won by BHP Billiton came as rival miner Xstrata scrapped its proposed $10bn bid for Lonmin. In a statement Mick Davies, chief executive of Xstrata, said: The current lack of clarity and certainty regarding the future availability of credit introduces significant risks into the financing package available to Xstrata.    Banks are trying to reduce the levels of credit exposure on their books over the end of the year in an effort to flatter their balance sheets and increase capital ratios as a percentage of risk weighted assets. However, the paralysis in the loan market is threatening to bloat the balance sheets with unsold loans.    Away from the BHP loan, banks are rushing to close the $45 billion financing backing Belgian brewer InBevs acquisition of US peer Anheuser-Busch, the 16.1 billion loan backing Germanys Schaefflers acquisition of tire-maker Continental and the 19 billion loan backing Gas Naturals acquisition of a stake in Spanish utility, Union Fenosa.&amp;amp;lt;     You can visit Financial News at http://www.efinancialnews.com                thread start
