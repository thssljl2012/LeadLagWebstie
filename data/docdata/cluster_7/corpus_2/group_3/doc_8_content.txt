         I posted these two polls recently.   http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11226261&amp;amp;amp;view=r...   http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11242780&amp;amp;amp;view=r...   It is perhaps interesting to see how things move on.  Lloyds has fallen far from favour with a first poll rating of 19%, but now fallen to 6%..  probably a fear of contamination from HBOS.  Barclays falls from 5% to 1%..  interesting that this should be the case as there is no new negative news for them that I&amp;#039;m aware of.  RBS/NW stays put at 7%  HSBC rises from 38% to 41%, keeping the same poll tally.  and the big winner is:  The mattress  going from 31% to 45%   The polled numbers were 74 for the first poll and 69 for the second.  On a statistical basis taking the square root of the number polled gives and idea of the kind of accuracy, which is roughly 8 counts or more than 10%.  Not a hugely accurate poll, but the mattress did gain by the amount of the implied accuracy number suggesting the move is probably significant.  832
