          Also with these shares can the bank &amp;#039;repay&amp;#039; them earlier if it has the funds, so it may take less than five years.   I&amp;#039;m not certain whether that&amp;#039;s a statement or a question?  If it&amp;#039;s a question, this morning&amp;#039;s announcements don&amp;#039;t seem to me to clearly answer it. The preference shares deals for RBS and Lloyds TSB/HBOS look similar in many respects, but the Lloyds TSB announcement says that they are &amp;amp;quot;callable&amp;amp;quot; after 5 years and the RBS one doesn&amp;#039;t. So either slightly different arrangements are being put in place for different banks, or there are some variations in what they happen to have chosen to put into these announcements. Which it is will become apparent from the details in the shareholder circulars - so I&amp;#039;m waiting until they&amp;#039;re out before making up my mind. In particular, details of which of the holder and the bank can force redemption of the preference shares and when are important (especially the bank, since that rather high 12% rate makes me doubtful that holders will want to force their redemption).  One thing that has become apparent to me from this morning&amp;#039;s announcements is that this capital raising and associated dividend cuts are being forced on the banks by a regulatory change - they&amp;#039;re being told &amp;amp;quot;Get your Tier 1 Capital ratios up to around 11%, or else&amp;amp;quot; (the Barclays announcement seems to me to be the most revealing in this respect of the ones I&amp;#039;ve read). That&amp;#039;s rather different from the normal situation for a dividend cut, which is basically that the company is cutting the dividend because it cannot support it financially, and I haven&amp;#039;t made up my mind yet what sort of attitude I want to take to it.  By the way, I&amp;#039;m not saying that these dividend cuts aren&amp;#039;t also necessary for that more standard reason - they might well be - just that with the Government forcing them to increase their Tier 1 Capital ratios, it&amp;#039;s impossible to tell...  Anyway, at present my attitude is &amp;amp;quot;more details required, and also more thought about how my HYP should deal with this rather novel sort of situation&amp;amp;quot;.
