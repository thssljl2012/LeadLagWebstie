 Barclays did a study a whle back. I cannot find the original but I have this from Bizjournal.  &amp;amp;quot;According to a February research report by Barclays Capital, about $312 billion in option ARMs will recast in 2008 through 2012, with 2010 and 2011 being the worst years. When their loans recast, borrowers&amp;#039; monthly payments would shoot up between 60 percent and 80 percent, on average. In most cases, the loans will exceed the value of their homes, according to Barclays.&amp;amp;quot;  Tha table that I saw from Barclays showed that from mid-2010 to the end of 2012 the forecast recast payment will increase between 61-83%.  Most of these are in Claifornia where property values are taking a big hit. Homeowners are going to owe more than the house is worth and that make refinancing very difficult.  For those who don&amp;#039;t know what is happening a quick explanation. The Option ARM allows you to pay less interest than the formal rate for a period of time. The unpaid interest is tacked on the original loan and it is called negative amortisation.  This is OK when values are going up but it is a train wreck when values are going down.  The ECONOMIST called it a bikini in winter.  WaMu and Wachovia were loaded down with these.
