I intend to make a monthly standing order to repay the capital, but which one do I opt for...?  Sorry, I must be dumb or ...please help clarify!!                      I do not have a FD offset so this may not be 100% mine is Barclays.     You can set the loan up to have payments based on interest only or repayment(or in between).  This will determine how the debt account is handled over the term of the loan.     The next option is usualy how your payment is calculated based on the offset funds, usualy keep it the same(overpay) or reduce it.     It really depends how much of the funds you want to keep access to     If you go interest only you have full access to the full amount for the term, repayment gives you a reducing amount, this is my prefered method since even if you take out your full offset you are still on target as if the mortgage was a normal one.
