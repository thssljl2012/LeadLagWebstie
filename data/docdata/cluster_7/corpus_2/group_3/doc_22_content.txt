                     Barclays Bank Base Rate                                      I&amp;#039;m on the +0.18% deal aswell, which has worked out great as there&amp;#039;ve been 3 quarter point cuts since I signed up and now today&amp;#039;s half point reduction. And obviously since then the deals have gotten worse, with Woolwich&amp;#039;s equivalent offer now being +0.89%.  To answer the points in this thread, they do not adjust your payment automatically when the BBBR changes but if there is a cut all that means is that you&amp;#039;ll be paying off more of your balance.  Also, the BBBR does not follow the BoE rate immediately but seems to lag behind for a few weeks (although I&amp;#039;m sure it wouldn&amp;#039;t if the BoE rate increased) as I&amp;#039;ve rung up within 1-2 days of the last BoE rate cut to have my payment adjusted, and was told I&amp;#039;d have to wait until the BBBR followed suit in a few weeks&amp;#039; time.
