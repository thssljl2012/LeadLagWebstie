Reserve Bank of Australia cuts by much more than expected - 100 bps vs. an estimated 50 bps.  The Australian stock market is up more than 1% as I am typing this:         http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;amp;sid=alFAfyO1cljY&amp;amp;amp;refer=home         This also sets the stage for a deeper-than-expected cut by the Bank of England this Thursday (perhaps 75 bps or higher).
