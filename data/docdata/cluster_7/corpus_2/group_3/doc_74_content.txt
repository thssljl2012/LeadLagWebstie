I wouldn&amp;#039;t say people here are uninformed, but it really varies from bank to bank.                         Exactly, it varies from bank to bank.      There might be those banks who will do retrenchments and those who will increase in bad times.      Strange but true for now. You never know but maybe local banks might be the first to do axing..??        Some Fr banks might increase due to chopping in their HQ and expanding in SG. But some may chop? like Citi? Behemoth giants, complex and complicated, see what magic the indian chief will do...      Then again, cuts wont be uniformed across all depts.      Local MNCs whose pnl is affected more will likely to do cuts, its a no-brainer, chop those 40s and 50s above in non-critical operation, whose salaries are too expensive. Put those late 20s or 30s into their position, immediate cost saving. Imagine cut many of those at 100k n above salary, how much cost saving there will be??? Also, this crisis is a good excuse whether or not the Company needs some cut or not.      What technicial or non-technical bull**** they are feeding us, we will know later.      I think the property prices in SG still relatively high, sustained by the FT influx - 4.84 million. According to govt statistics, yoy growth rate is 5.05%. If this is maintained yoy, you can expect sustainable growth in properties. But once, the growth is negative, you will know what happens to property prices. Already started dropping is the office rentals in CBD areas, with more banks getting out to cheaper areas in near future, the decline seem inevitable. And usually, office rentals should be a good proxy for the residential rental market.      We will know the truth in 2009; Whether a sharp V shape, U shape, L shape economic situation.       I cant predict so far, can you?
