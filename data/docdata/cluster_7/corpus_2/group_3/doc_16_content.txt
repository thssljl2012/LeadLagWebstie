Natwest / RBS / Commonwealth or Barclays / Westpac etc.                          That&amp;#039;s not correct.      The Commonwealth Bank has no connection with Natwest/RBS (or any other European banking institution). The Commonwealth Bank owns some other financial institutions in Asia-Pacific, but Commonwealth is the parent (it&amp;#039;s not owned by anyone else). It&amp;#039;s now buying BankWest and may also buy Suncorp.      Westpac also owns some other financial institutions in Asia-Pacific (soon +St George). It has no links to Barclays nor is it owned by anyone else. Westpac *is* the parent.      As to the global problems: As Tiddly said, Australian banks don&amp;#039;t have many of the now worthless overseas sub-prime investments      What does affect the Aussie banks the same as other banks around the world is that the inter-bank rates for borrowing money from each other have gone up dramatically (because banks are nervous about lending to each other and there is therefore  less money to go round). That&amp;#039;s the reason why the Aussie banks don&amp;#039;t want to pass on today&amp;#039;s rate cut by the Reserve Bank in full.      Gina
