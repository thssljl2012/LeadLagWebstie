 MLPs Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 2              Barclays on DEP          Duncan Energy Partners LP       (DEP - US$ 15.27) 2-Equal weight            Change of Earnings Forecast           3Q Impacted by Hurricanes           Investment Conclusion            We are pushing back our assumption for an asset drop down from 2009 to 2010 due to weak capital markets. While our 2009 growth assumptions are lower, DEP offers a healthy 11% yield and the support of a strong parent, in our view.            Summary             &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56457;      DEP&amp;#039;s 3Q distributable cash flow was $2 MM below our expectations, which appromixates the amount of damage and lost business from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike.     &amp;amp;nbsp;       &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56457;     EBITDA was flat YoY, as improved results in NGL &amp;amp;amp; Petrochemical Storage and Onshore Natural Gas Pipelines were offset by declines in Petrochemical Pipeline Services and NGL Pipeline Services businesses.     &amp;amp;nbsp;       &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56457;     DEP&amp;#039;s latest quarterly cash distribution was flat sequentially and up 2.4% YoY at $0.42 per unit ($1.68 annualized). Distribution coverage in 3Q was 0.9x and 1.1x YTD.     &amp;amp;nbsp;       &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56457;     Visibility on an asset drop down became much murkier with the onset of the latest capital market turmoil. We are delaying our estimate for an acquisition until 2010, when the cost of capital would hopefully return to more normalized levels.     &amp;amp;nbsp;       &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56457;      At an 11% yield, DEP is trading at a discount to its historical average yield of 8%.        &amp;amp;nbsp;
