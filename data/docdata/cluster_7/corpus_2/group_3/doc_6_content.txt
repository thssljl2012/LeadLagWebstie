No it is still $0 because in this case both the clients are long exposure to the AUDUSD, ANZ has the short exposure on both contracts but because each contract work in opposite directions (ie one Call one Put) it doesn&amp;#039;t matter what the currency does or what happens to Holden and Chrysler.  ANZ has already been paid for the Forwards so they are happy.      This Thread does touch on a real issue and that is banks managing their derivatives exposure, in the above example I have given it&amp;#039;s perfect for ANZ in reality there will be some imbalance.  Barings Bank when Nick Leeson brought it down was a classic example of poor risk management.  They were hopelessly long on the Japanese Equities market and The Kobe Earthquake knocked down the Nikkei, Barings went down with it.      What is important is Banks Net exposure to derivatives.  By Net I mean by matching off Short and Long positions also how much risk the banks have laid off.  basically running a derivatives book is like bookmaking laying off risk and adjusting the odds.
