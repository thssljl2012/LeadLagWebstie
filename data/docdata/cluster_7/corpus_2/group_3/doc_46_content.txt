 Hi.     I&amp;#039;ve got a lifetime tracker with the Woolwich which is stated to be 0.29% above Bank of England base rate.     I got to thinking that if the inter bank (LIBOR) rate remaons at 6%+ or something closes to this, the bank will be losing money on my mortgage, particularly if BOE rate falls to 3.25% by end of 2009 as is widely predicted.  If this was the case, they would be lending to me at 3.54%     I dug out the mortgage offer, and surprisingly, the wording is not &amp;amp;quot;0.29% above Bank of England&amp;amp;quot; , but is &amp;amp;quot;0.29% above Barclays Bank PLCs base rate&amp;amp;quot;     My question is could my bank (or any other bank for that matter) choose to change their own base rate independently of BOE changes and so make &amp;amp;quot;the tracker&amp;amp;quot; an irrelevant concept.     Comments Please...
