 UPL Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 4              Drilling rigs likely to decline in Barnett Shale     http://www.star-telegram.com/804/story/1001086.html     &amp;amp;nbsp;    By JIM FUQUAY    The number of drilling rigs working in the Barnett Shale is holding steady for now, but most observers expect a drop of 10 to 20 percent in the next six months as producers trim their spending in response to plummeting natural gas prices.          According to RigData, there were 205 active rigs in 16 Barnett Shale counties as of last week. Thats just about the average for the year.    However, some producers have said they expect to hire fewer drilling rigs in coming months.    Chesapeake Energy, one of the busiest drillers in the field, says it expects to cut its fleet in the area from more than 40 to about 33 within about a month. Quicksilver Resources plans to reduce its rigs from 14 to nine.    Another big player, Devon Energy, said it plans no changes to its budget in 2009.    The anticipated drilling slowdown in the Barnett Shale is likely to be repeated nationwide, said Richard Mason, publisher of  Land Rig Newsletter  in Lubbock. He said most estimates call for a 10 to 20 percent decline in the national rig count, which on Oct. 24 stood at 1,964, according to Baker Hughes, a big Houston oil-field services firm.    That would translate into 200 to 400 rigs being idled. That high number comes from James Crandell of Barclays Capital; Chesapeake Chairman Aubrey McClendon last month also speculated that 200 to 400 rigs could be without work by years end.    Nabors Industries, the worlds largest onshore driller, said last week it expects a slump in natural gas drilling to idle between 40 and 50 of its 1,225 onshore and offshore rigs.      What it means      Mason said he has heard estimates in the range of 40 rigs in the Barnett Shale. Each rig, he said, directly employs about 20 workers and at least that many in related services, such as truck drivers and site-preparation workers, meaning the loss of 40 rigs could affect at least 1,600 jobs.    &amp;quot;I would look at the first half of 2009&amp;quot; for a low, Mason said. He said the industry typically bottoms out in the years first quarter, so by early in the second quarter the picture should be clearer.    There is ample precedent for sharp declines in the rig count when petroleum prices tumble, he said.    In 1998, the U.S. rig count fell 38 percent during the year, while in 2001 it fell 31 percent. Both years saw energy prices collapse, as crude oil went from nearly $18 a barrel in early 1998 to as low as $10.72 late in the year, while in 2001, natural gas started the year at $9.82 per 1,000 cubic feet and bottomed out at $1.83.    So far this year, natural gas futures started the year at $7.85, rose as high as $13.58 and closed Monday at $6.12, its low for the year.      The bottom line      Mason put the price decline into perspective this way: He multiplied U.S. gas production by the average price for June, when prices were near their peak, and came up with $45 billion in total revenue for the industry that month. By September, he said, that had fallen to $34 billion, and prices have fallen about $1 per 1,000 cubic feet since then.    &amp;quot;Once you eliminate 25 percent of your revenue, its hard to imagine its not going to have an impact,&amp;quot; Mason said. &amp;quot;Theres going to be a pullback. The question is how much.&amp;quot;    Only partially offsetting the price decline in gas prices is a two-year decline in rig day rates  the cost of leasing a drilling rig each day. Mason said rig rates in the Barnett Shale peaked at about $20,000 but average about $16,500 today.       JIM FUQUAY, 817-390-7552
