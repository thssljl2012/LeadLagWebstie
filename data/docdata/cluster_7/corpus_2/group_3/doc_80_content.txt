 MLPs Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 5              Re: GP&amp;#039;s vs MLP&amp;#039;s    I have always read that GPs both grow and decline&amp;amp;nbsp;at a faster rate than the MLP. My guess is that the GPs are lagging because people are worried that the MLPs will not be able to grow because of the credit crisis and that would be even more detrimental to GPs. I myself think the GPs are bargains. The projected distribution has actually increased for ETP which means ETE should do&amp;amp;nbsp;even better. Barclays projects 11% growth for ETP ad 28% growth for ETE.          thread start
