Dear All,     1 More positive news and sentiments emerging, as follows:    a.  &amp;amp;quot; retiring National Australia Bank chief John Stewart, who said Australia has been &amp;amp;quot;ahead of the game&amp;amp;quot; and could avoid a recession.&amp;amp;quot;....&amp;amp;quot;With any luck, we&amp;#039;ll stave off a recession, (even if) it might feel like a recession,&amp;amp;quot; Mr Stewart said.    b.  &amp;amp;quot;The worst is behind us, says RBA&amp;amp;quot; screamed the  news headline in the Brisbane Times Newspaper today, not withstanding the fact that the local inflation has reached almost 5%,a 20 years  new record level.     http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/arti...351289113.html     2.  Finally, some white light are now  beginning to shine through as we approach the end of the tunnel.     Cheers,  Kenneth KOH
