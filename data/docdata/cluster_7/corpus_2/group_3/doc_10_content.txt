  [quote=brucekaren;6853932]We are considering using the Commonwealth Bank. I would think with them having a UK branch in London, would allow our savings to be covered by the 50k guarantee. Provided its held in the UK branch.[quote]   Yes, it will be covered by the GBP50k guarantee.      See here for confirmation:    www.migrantbanking.co.uk/legal_information/       Scroll down (it still says GBP35k but it&amp;#039;s now GBP50k).      But when your money is in Australia you might like to know that the four big Australian banks (CBA, NAB, Westpac, ANZ) are all rated AA. And there are only 20 banks in total in the world with an AA rating. That&amp;#039;s as good as it gets.      Gina
