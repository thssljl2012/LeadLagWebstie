Our $43 price target is based on a 12-month distribution run rate of $3.66 (previously $3.68) and a target yield of 8.5%.                                   &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56451;     3Q EBITDA 3% above our estimates, as strength in the Terminals business more than offset lower-than-expected Pipelines results. Energy Services and Gas Storage were in line.                                   &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56451;     BPL increased its quarterly distribution 6.1% YoY and 1.4% sequentially to $0.875 per unit ($3.50 annualized). The distribution will be paid Nov 28 to unitholders of record Nov 7. Due to weak capital markets and a slowdown in refined products demand, we are modestly lowering our 2009 distribution growth rate from 6% to 5%.                                   &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56451;     The diversification of cash flows stemming from the natural gas storage and refined product marketing acquisitions in 2008 positively impacted 3Q results by moderating BPL&amp;#039;s heavy exposure to pipelines (though still the largest segment). Natural gas and marketing businesses posted higher EBITDA sequentially, while the pipeline business posted lower EBITDA.
