LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - The gilts yield curve steepened on Tuesday, after gloomy economic data boosted demand for shorter maturities and the British government pressed ahead with issuance that has weighed on prices in recent weeks.    At 1541 GMT, government bond yields at the front end of the curve were down with the two-year yield losing 8 basis points to 3.42 percent, reflecting popularity for shorter-dated gilts.    Ten-year gilt yields were barely changed at 4.60 percent, while 50-year yields were up 4 basis points.    The comparatively liquid December long gilt future -- based on 10-year prices -- was up just 4 ticks at 110.77, while short sterling for December was down 2 ticks at 95.370.    Earlier in the session, gilts rose after the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said confidence in the manufacturing sector has also plummeted and more than 60,000 jobs could disappear before the end of the year.    &amp;#039;The CBI survey heightens the case for the Bank of England to cut interest rates aggressively again in November, we expect to see another 50 basis points cut from 4.50 percent to 4.00 percent,&amp;#039; Howard Archer, chief economist at Global Insight said in a research note.    The rise in short-dated gilts also mirrored gains in euro zone government debt as weak U.S. data knocked stocks across Europe, with the FTSE-100 index of leading shares down 1.2 percent to 4229 points.    The Debt Management Office (DMO) auctioned 4.75 billion pounds of 2011 gilts at 4.25 percent on Tuesday, which received healthy demand of 2.29 times cover.    Investors will also take cues from the BoE&amp;#039;s governor, Mervyn King, when he speaks at the Royal Armouries in Leeds, later on Tuesday as well as BoE minutes due at 0830 GMT on Wednesday.    The DMO&amp;#039;s next auction is for 3 billion pounds of 2018 gilts on Thursday.    &amp;#039;The acid test for the market will actually by the 18s issue on Thursday because that will come after the (BoE) minutes and after the Governor&amp;#039;s speech,&amp;#039; Moyeen Islam, gilts strategist at Barclays Capital said.    The DMO also said it would create 50 billion pounds of gilts on Wednesday for use in the Bank of England&amp;#039;s new discount window facility, which enables banks to borrow gilts for up to 30 days against collateral.    The DMO will not sell the new gilts directly to the market, but will hold them in an account from which banks can borrow them via the new BoE facility, which aims to improve liquidity in interbank lending markets.    The DMO added it would auction 1 billion pounds of 2032 index-linked gilts with a coupon of 1.25 percent on Oct. 28, and 4 billion pounds of 2016 conventional gilts with a 4 percent coupon on Oct. 30.    The British government has stepped up issuance plans to recapitalise banks hit by the past year&amp;#039;s credit market turmoil.    * Dec gilt 110.77 (+0.04)    * Dec short sterling 95.370 (-0.020)    (Editing by Andy Bruce) Keywords: MARKETS BRITAIN GILTS    tf.TFN-Europe_newsdesk@thomsonreuters.com    jlw    COPYRIGHT    Copyright Thomson Financial News Limited 2008.
