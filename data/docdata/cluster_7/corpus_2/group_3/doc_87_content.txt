  INTERVIEW - Norfolk Southern CEO sees &amp;amp;quot;pricing momentum&amp;amp;quot;         DETROIT, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Norfolk Southern Corp&amp;#039;s freight prices look solid through the second quarter of 2009 and should remain robust beyond that point, CEO Wick Moorman said on Wednesday.      &amp;amp;quot;In this kind of economic environment, we are always a little cautious,&amp;amp;quot; Moorman told Reuters in a telephone interview. &amp;amp;quot;That said, we still think our service is attractively priced, and we are confident we can maintain pricing momentum.&amp;amp;quot;      He added that &amp;amp;quot;not much is likely to happen&amp;amp;quot; in the U.S. auto industry in 2009 and said he was hopeful the slumping U.S. housing sector has &amp;amp;quot;approached a bottom.&amp;amp;quot;      &amp;amp;quot;When it will start to climb out the other side is unclear,&amp;amp;quot; Moorman said.      The chief executive spoke to Reuters a day after the No. 4 U.S. railroad announced a better-than-expected third-quarter profit. Solid pricing offset weakness in the housing and automotive sectors and an overall weakening of the U.S. economy.      Moorman said although housing and automotive remained a &amp;amp;quot;drag on earnings,&amp;amp;quot; the railroad&amp;#039;s coal and agricultural freight business remains robust.      And while international intermodal services are down, Moorman said domestic U.S. shipments were benefiting from a shift from truck to train.      Intermodal services haul finished consumer goods in standardized containers that can be interchanged between truck, ship and train. Hauling goods by train is cheaper than by truck, and railroads have picked up some long-haul business from trucking companies in recent months thanks in large part to high gas prices.      Analysts hailed Norfolk Southern&amp;#039;s quarterly results, which were posted after the stock market closed on Tuesday.      &amp;amp;quot;In our opinion, Norfolk Southern remains the best operating U.S. railroad, led by its ... continued pricing power and large exposure to coal, intermodal and grain,&amp;amp;quot; Merrill Lynch analyst Ken Hoexter wrote in a note to clients.      Barclays Capital analyst Gary Chase wrote in a research note that &amp;amp;quot;we see upside to fourth-quarter earnings for the rails.&amp;amp;quot;      But he added that he was &amp;amp;quot;concerned about the longer-term ability to increase pricing and sustain earnings growth in a weakening economic environment.&amp;amp;quot;      In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Norfolk Southern shares were up $1.48, or 2.75 percent, at $55.35.
