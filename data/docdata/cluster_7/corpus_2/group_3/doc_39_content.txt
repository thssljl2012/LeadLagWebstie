Looks like we are caught between a rock and a hard place. Technically isn&amp;#039;t this stagflation ?      http://business.theage.com.au/busine...1020-54t1.html                                              Quote:                     Inflation set to hit 5%         Peter Martin       October 21, 2008   Page 1 of 2   ECONOMISTS have reaffirmed predictions for more cuts in interest rates despite signs that Australia&amp;#039;s annual inflation rate is set to hit 5% - well beyond the Reserve Bank&amp;#039;s target zone.  As the Commonwealth Bank yesterday joined the ANZ and the NAB in trimming its home mortgage rates, new figures showed that costs faced by businesses had soared beyond expectations.  The producer price index went up by 5.6% in the year to September - the biggest rise in the decade since the index was first calculated.  The surprise result prompted economists to lift forecasts for the annual consumer price inflation figure to 5%. But they said the release of the inflation figure tomorrow was unlikely to deter the Reserve Bank from delivering more rate relief as the threat of a global recession became clearer.  Commonwealth Securities economist Savanth Sebastian said the central bank believed tomorrow&amp;#039;s inflation figures would mark the peak of the cycle, following the collapse of oil prices and the onset of a global slowdown.  Financial markets expect the Reserve Bank to remain focused on the risk of an economic downturn and are pricing in a 92% probability of a further rate cut of half a percentage point at the next board meeting on November 4. Such a cut would take standard variable home loan rates below 8%.
