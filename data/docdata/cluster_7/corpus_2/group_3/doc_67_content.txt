Andrew Dickinson, who is head of banking at professional services firm KPMG, told a media briefing in Sydney that about 10,000 of the industry&amp;#039;s 152,000 staff could lose their jobs in the year to September 2009, as banks reduced costs.    Mr Dickinson said about 10 per cent of the workforce at St George Bank Ltd would probably have to go over the longer-term, as a result of the takeover of the bank by Westpac Banking Corporation Ltd. Westpac expects to carry out the merger by December 1, if St George shareholders vote in favour of the tie-up in November.    Mr Dickinson was speaking at the release of the KPMG Annual Survey of Australian Bank Profits.
