Something rather scary.  I have seen research that says the big 4 can easily absord losses if house prices fall 30% but I suspect it would cause chaos with the loan books of St George, Adelaide Bank and a few smaller players.         http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/...738220759.html       HOUSING MARKET: IRELAND WILL see more demolition than construction of houses over the next decade, as the economy struggles to recover from the collapse of the housing market and the emergence of zombie banks, UCD economist Morgan Kelly told the conference.      In a presentation that drew several collective intakes of breath, Mr Kelly predicted that house prices would fall by 80 per cent from peak to trough in real terms.      Construction, but not demolition, of residential and commercial property will fall to zero for the foreseeable future, he said.   ..      In discussing the 110 billion given in loans to developers, Mr Kelly said a typical regional housing collapse in the US saw banks sustain a 20 per cent loss on these loans, but the narrowness of the Irish market increased the risk of substantially larger losses for Irish banks.       The guarantees of Anglo and [Irish] Nationwide liabilities have a strong chance of being called in over the next 21 months, he said. Extending the Government guarantee to these two financial institutions was extraordinarily unwise and could produce losses that the State cannot afford to repay .
