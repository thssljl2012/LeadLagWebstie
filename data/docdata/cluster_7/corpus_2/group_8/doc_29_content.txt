  Pound slumps on continued fallout from Northern Rock nationalisation        LONDON (Thomson Financial) - The   pound   slumped to a one-month low against the euro on concerns over the outlook for the UK economy combine with the  continued fallout from news of the planned nationalisation of Northern Rock.   The Northern Rock debacle has only served to highlight just how dependent the UK economy is on the financial services sector, with consumers expected to rein in spending as they ramp up their savings.  'Sterling seems to be firmly at the bottom of the list in terms of major currencies at the moment,' said Neil Mellor at the Bank of New York Mellon.       Fears of stagflation in the UK  are gathering pace, with the Bank of England looking as though it will have little room to cut interest rates, given high inflation. At the same time, the parlous state of the public finances will restrict the flexibility the government has for fiscal stimulus.  In that respect, market players will be paying close attention to tomorrow's release of the  minutes to the Bank of England meeting earlier this month , as well as public finances figures.  The BoE's Monetary Policy Committee cut interest rates by a quarter point on February 7 to 5.25 pct in a decision that is widely expected to have been unanimous. Investors will be looking carefully, however, to see whether arch-dove David Blanchflower opted for a bigger 50 basis point move, or whether any of the more hawkish members preferred to vote for no change.      Meanwhile, the   Australian dollar   was the star performer of the day, in stark contrast to the pound, causing it to surge to multi-year highs against the UK currency as well as to a three-and-a-half-month high against the US dollar.  The Australian unit has been buoyed by the revelation overnight that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) considered hiking interest rates by 50 basis points at its last meeting.    'The overnight performances of sterling and the Australian dollar provided the perfect depiction of two currencies whose fortunes have diverged,' Mellor said.  'Australia continues to enjoy a pretty positive economic backdrop and a hawkish central bank, whilst fears over UK stagflation abound,' he added.      Elsewhere, the dollar was on the back foot against the   euro   as concerns intensify that the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary easing will not be able to stave off a severe economic downturn.  The euro hit a two-week high against the dollar of 1.4756 usd.
