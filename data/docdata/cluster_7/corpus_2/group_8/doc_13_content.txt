  Pound jumps as BoE says no bids received for emergency funding        LONDON (Thomson Financial) - The pound spiked against the dollar after it emerged that the Bank of England's auction of 10 bln stg at an interest rate of 6.75 pct was completely ignored by commercial banks.      The pound, which was weakening on an earlier BoE report that warned credit conditions may worsen in the fourth quarter, spiked on the auction result. The UK currency hit 2.0170 usd from 2.0130 before the announcement. Against the euro, the pound recovered sharply to around 0.7000 stg from 0.7025 just before the news.      'Good news at last for sterling as the BoE announces the news that they received no bids for their latest 3-month offering,' said Matthew Foster-Smith at Thomson IFR Markets.      He noted that the Libor 3-month interbank borrowing rate was fixed at 6.32 pct today, far below the 6.75 pct offered by the BoE -- although some banks are still borrowing at a touch above the Libor rate in order to ensure they have funds.   __________________________________________        European govt bonds lower after strong signs of pick up in German inflation        LONDON (Thomson Financial) - European government bonds were lower after German inflation figures showed an uncomfortable rise, in turn weighing on expectations that the European Central Bank may be persuaded to lower interest rates.      Data from the various German states were higher than generally expected. In      North Rhine Westphalia the annual inflation rate jumped to 2.6 pct from 2.0 pct in August. Analysts believe this could mean that overall German inflation may well surpass the 1.9 pct seen in August      'The ECB's rate policy dilemma keeps deepening, with a paradox opening between softening growth momentum and rising inflation pressure,' said David Brown at Bear Stearns.      'Just at the juncture that the ECB may be responding to slower growth dynamics in the economy, the stronger euro and heightened financial contagion risks, higher inflation comes along to complication the decision on rates,' he added.      It is worth noting too that ECB rate setters have been consistently on the hawkish side despite the recent credit market problems and the euro's steep ascent against the dollar.      Solid equities performance also weighed on bonds. Stock markets throughout Europe were higher while Wall Street also opened up, weighing on fixed income assets even more.      In the UK, gilts were tracking their European counterparts lower.      The day's economic data passed by quietly without causing a ripple, even after the inaugural credit conditions survey from the Bank of England showed that credit conditions are tightening.      UK second quarter GDP data meanwhile, came in roughly within expectations and reaction was muted, given the backward-looking nature of the release.   _______________________________________        Dollar recovers after new low vs. euro        NEW YORK (AP) - The dollar recovered slightly against major currencies Wednesday despite more lackluster economic data, but not before hitting another record low against the euro.      The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that durable goods orders fell by 4.9 percent in August, the biggest decline since January. Weak demand for manufactured goods could spell a slowdown in the U.S. industrial sector, but 'the data out today was pretty well discounted in advance,' said Bob Sinche, head of global foreign exchange strategy at Bank of America Corp.      The 13-nation euro rose to $1.4162 -- its fifth record in as many trading days -- before easing back to $1.4136 in late New York trading, down from $1.4146 Tuesday.      The euro reached its previous peak of $1.4153 Tuesday after a pair of economic reports painted a dismal picture for U.S. consumers and the ailing home sales market.      'Against currencies like the euro, we could be seeing the highs being put in about now,' Sinche said. The market had been overreacting to recession fears, and investors' worries about growth have taken a back seat for the moment, he said, boosting the dollar. Some economists disagreed, however, taking slowed widespread demand for manufactured goods as a sign of a softening economy.      Last week, the Federal Reserve cut a key interest rate by a bigger-than-expected half percentage point, hoping to stave off economic slowdown. Another Fed rate cut seems likely in October, according to Sinche, and some analysts believe a December rate cut probable as well.      Lower interest rates, used to jump-start an economy, can weaken a currency as investors transfer funds to countries where their deposits and fixed-income investments bring higher returns.      In other New York trading, the dollar gained after hitting a 15-year low Monday against six major currencies. The British pound fell to $2.0155 from its level of $2.0180 in New York late Tuesday, and the dollar rose to 115.43 Japanese yen from 114.55 yen.      The dollar bought 1.1699 Swiss francs, up from 1.1661 Tuesday, and 1.0056 Canadian dollars, up from 1.0014.
