     ANZ, CBA, Westpac Outlook Cut to Negative by Moodys          By Malcolm Scott        March 2 (Bloomberg) -- Three of Australias four biggest banks may face downgrades of their credit ratings by Moodys Investors Service as the economy slows and bad debts rise.        Moodys lowered its outlook on Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Corp. to negative from stable, the New York-based ratings company said in a statement today. Moodys revised the outlook for National Australia Bank Ltd. to negative in August.        It is the first time Australias four biggest banks have had a negative outlook since the 1991 recession, said Patrick Winsbury, vice president at Moodys in Sydney. The nations slowing economy is fueling rising bad loans and eroding profit at the lenders, which have avoided the losses posted by global competitors including Citigroup Inc. as they benefited from demand for government-guaranteed bonds.        The negative outlook reflects the potential for the deepening global economic downturn to have a protracted impact on the banks asset quality and earnings, Winsbury said.        The banks remain solidly positioned within the Aa category, while government-guaranteed bank obligations remain Aaa-rated with a stable outlook, Moodys said in todays statement.        All three banks continue to have strong credit profiles and benefit from a very high level of support from the Australian government, Winsbury said.        Shares Fall        Separately, Suncorp-Metway Ltd., the countrys third- largest general insurer, had its long-term deposit and debt ratings lowered to A1, with a stable outlook, from Aa3 by Moodys today. Its bank financial strength rating was cut to C+, with a negative outlook.        Westpac, Australias largest bank by market value, fell 3.5 percent to A$16.30 in Sydney trading, while Commonwealth Bank, the second-biggest, declined 4.3 percent to A$28.51. ANZ Bank, which said last week it would cut its dividend for the first time since 1991, slipped 1.6 percent to A$13.10.        Moodys said last month the review of Australian banks credit rating outlook was necessary because it expects a 0.4 percent contraction in Australias economy for 2009 and a peak in unemployment of 7.2 percent in the third quarter of 2010.        Australias gross domestic product expanded 0.1 percent in the third quarter, the weakest pace in eight years. Figures for the last three months of 2008 will be published on March 4.        Australian banks are likely to face rising losses on loans to mining, tourism, property and retail businesses, Fitch Ratings said last month. In September, Standard &amp; Poors said Australias four biggest banks were well placed to withstand the global market turmoil.
