         " SYDNEY: Australia's economy unexpectedly contracted for the first time in eight years last quarter as companies ran down inventories at the fastest pace in over two decades, reviving the prospect of more interest rate cuts.  The Australian dollar slid on Wednesday while bill futures surged as investors wagered the Reserve Bank of Australia would come to regret that it didn't cut rates at its policy meeting on Tuesday.  The fourth-quarter gross domestic product shrank a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent from the previous quarter, when GDP expanded 0.1 percent.  The fourth-quarter data fell short of a Reuters median forecast of 0.2 percent growth. "  http://www.iht.com/articles/2009/03/04/business/04ozecon.php...     Not quite recession due it not (yet, imv) being two consecutive quarters of contraction - damn close though eh harmy.     " Growth in the US has fallen back by 1.6 percent in the December quarter, by 1.5 per cent in the UK, by 3.3 per cent in Japan, by 6.1 per cent in Taiwan and by 0.8 per cent in Canada.  With 17 of the world's advanced economies now in recession, and with 27 having suffered at least one quarter of negative economic growth, Rudd said it would be "harder and harder for Australia to resist the global economic ties". Seven out of ten of Australia's trading partners are now battling recession.  "  http://money.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=760096      awbMaven
