Colebatch and Turnbull eh?           Quote:                            Budget won't take pressure off inflation   Tim Colebatch May 15 2008     MARKET economists agreed. The Government has produced a reasonable budget,  but not one that will take the pressure off inflation or interest rates.  And with uncertainty over whether demand will slow in 2008-09 as much as the Reserve Bank has forecast,  Westpac warned that rates could go higher, or at least stay where they are until 2010.      Treasurer Wayne Swan would not say whether he expects the budget to lead to rate cuts. But he said it took pressure off the bank by using fiscal policy to tackle inflation. "This is a modest tightening," Mr Swan told the National Press Club. "We've got very uncertain international environments slowing growth. We've got higher domestic inflation. The balance we've struck, we believe, is the right one."      But shadow treasurer Malcolm Turnbull said the Treasurer had failed to deliver on his promise to use the budget to take pressure off interest rates. "Any more rates rises from now on, Wayne Swan owns," Mr Turnbull said. "He spent four months saying to everybody that he was going to make massive cuts in spending to put downward pressure on inflation. "In fact, he's gone in the other direction. He's got a budget that's stimulatory, that adds to inflationary pressures."       Market economists disagreed, but said the $2 billion of net budget savings was too small to affect the Reserve's decisions. "The Government has handed down a workmanlike budget, but it certainly can't claim to have pushed the Reserve Bank to the interest rate sidelines," said CommSec chief economist Craig James. "It would have taken a draconian budget to have caused the Reserve Bank to think twice about rate hikes."     "The RBA would see it as leaning in the desired direction, but not much more," said the National Australia Bank's Alan Oster and Jeff Oughton. Commonwealth Bank chief economist Michael Blythe agreed, saying the budget "will do more to protect against near-term downside growth risks than wind back near-term upside inflation risks."     At ANZ, chief economist Saul Eslake agreed. "It won't  add  to upward pressure on interest rates as the last few budgets did  but nor can it really be said that the budget 'exerts maximum pressure on interest rates'."      Westpac economists warned that the chief risk now is that demand will not slow this year as dramatically as the Reserve Bank (and Treasury) have forecast, and that the Reserve would have to either raise rates again, or hold them for two more years.  "The risk that the bank will need to take out further 'insurance' on rates has been increased," they said. "We are unconvinced that rates will be reduced by the end of 2009." "The budget will not help, but is at worst a modest hindrance. The required slowdown will still need to emanate overwhelmingly from the private sector."     Reserve governor Glenn Stevens has played down the role that budgets can play in tackling inflation. "It will take very major changes in fiscal policy to completely obviate the need for what we are doing," he told a Parliamentary committee last month. "I will be happy to see any support from fiscal policy we can get, but  when all is said and done, containing inflation is mainly the central bank's job."                     Turnbull will end up with more egg on his face today when the RBA again cuts the official cash rate. If, as expected, they cut the rate by 0.5% then the benchmark rate will drop to 5.5%. It will finally be back below the 5.75% rate we had when Howard and Costello lost the plot and overcooked the economy in 2006/07.      It comes immediately after yesterday's news that the inflation rate in Australia fell for the first time since February 2006.      Turnbull is just another arse-clown in the same mould as Howard/Costello/Abbott/Downer/Nelson
