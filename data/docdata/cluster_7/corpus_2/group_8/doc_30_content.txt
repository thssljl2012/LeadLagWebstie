          "Today the FTSE dipped below its intra-day low on the 28th of October.  Are we in better position now versus then? Imo, yes. We are much further forward in sorting the banks, interest rates are lower, inventories have run down further, companies have cut costs &amp; shed capacity, investors &amp; people are more pessimistic. "    Here's how Anatole Kaletsky sees it.    "The good news last week was the British and US Governments finally drawing a line under the collapse of their sickest financial institutions, Royal Bank of Scotland and Citibank. The bad news is that this was the fourth such final resolution and each of the previous lines in the sand had been rubbed out within a month."     http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/anatole_...   Also,   "Consider the growth projections published on November 25 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the world's pre-eminent forecasting institution. The OECD predicted that in the fourth quarter of 2008, GDP would fall by 2.8 per cent annualised in the US, by 2.1 per cent in Britain and by 1.0 per cent in the eurozone, Germany and Japan. Last week we learnt the actual figures: US GDP fell by 6.2 per cent annualised, Britain by 6 per cent, the eurozone by 6 per cent, Germany by 8.2 per cent and Japan by 12.8 per cent."
