2 short articles from Terry Ryder that I noticed this morning.            Quote:                         By Terry Ryder, 26th February 2009       Property investors concerned about dire predictions from economists are advised to ignore forecasts and concentrate on the actual events as they unfold. In most cases, the numbers delivered are considerably better than the pessimistic forecasts.            To date we have official data on real estate construction, property prices, mortgage lending, retail spending and unemployment which has been a lot more positive than the prior predictions from economists. Each announcement of actual statistics is greeted with surprise, even dismay, as economists seek to cover their tracks (which are littered with inaccurate forecasts).            The latest to emerge this week was a surprise increase in construction activity around Australia. The concensus among economists before the data release was that construction activity in the December quarter would fall about 3%. In fact, the figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that construction activity rose 1.7%.            The better-than-expected result was under-pinned by a 3.6% increase in engineering work and 1.3% in commercial construction.            As one economist grudgingly admitted: This is just another one of those indicators which has been a touch firmer than most expected. By most he means most economists, including those who recognize that the easiest way to get their names in newspapers is to make a dire prediction about something.            We were told to expect a decline in retail spending in the December quarter but it rose strongly. Economists have predicted a massive blow-out in unemployment but it has yet to be delivered.            Some economists predicted property values would fall 10%, 20%, even 40% - but in the December quarter the weighted average across the eight capital cities was a fall of just 0.8%. Prices actually rose in some cities and the news from most capitals early in 2009 is that prices are rising in first-home buyer suburbs while declining in top-end markets.            The message for property investors is to concentrate on the figures that portray actual outcomes and ignore forecasts from the nations gaggle of confused economists. As they say, if you laid all the economists in the world end-to-end, they still wouldnt reach a conclusion.                          Quote:                         Housing affordability the best in five years; 39% rise in December quarter      By Terry Ryder, 17th February 2009       Multiple interest rates cuts and the boost to the First Home Owners Grant have pushed housing affordability conditions to their best levels in five years.            The latest HIA-CBA First Home Buyer Affordability Index reveals a 39.2% increase in the affordability measure in the December quarter. The Index leapt from 110.3 in the September quarter to 153.6 in the December quarter, the most affordable level since March 2003.            Over the last three months of 2008, the average home loan repayment fell by 26% to $2,056 per month, significantly lower than the previous amount of $2,796.            Further reductions in mortgage interest rates in the first quarter of this year are expected to yield another improvement in housing affordability in the next report. Official interest rates are now four percentage points lower than August 2008.            Conditions have improved significantly for first-home buyers and clearly many Australians are taking up the opportunity to get into home ownership,  says HIAs chief executive  policy Chris Lamont.            HIA economic modelling based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics Survey of Income and Housing 2005/06 confirms that 135,000 households on mortgages have come out of mortgage stress since December 2008.            Previously a household would have to be earning in the order of $85,000 per year to afford a modestly priced home without going into severe mortgage stress, says Lamont.  The improvement in housing affordability means those on a more modest income can now consider a home of their own.            The HIA-CBA First Home Buyer Affordability Report showed that affordability improved over the December quarter in all capital cities and regional areas, with the largest improvements being for Perth, Brisbane, and Regional Western Australia.
