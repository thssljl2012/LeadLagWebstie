Activity in the services industry has contracted further as the global financial crisis keeps consumers at home, a survey says.     The Australian Industry Group-Commonwealth Bank performance of services index (PSI) fell 8.8 index points in February to 32.2 points.     It was the 11th straight month the index has come in below the key 50 level which separates expansion from contraction.     The survey found weak levels of consumer and business confidence, as well as falling demand, had caused a broad-based decline in activity among firms in the services sector.     Of the nine sectors covered in the survey, only communications services experienced an expansion in activity.     The largest decrease in activity was in the wholesale trade and personal and recreational services sectors.
