Is it not slightly puzzling that a man who rails against neo liberalism, Hayek and greed just gifts an enormous amount to the most rapacious bank Australia has probably ever seen?         What does he think they will do with the cash?             Feb. 3 (Bloomberg) -- Australian banks may have saved at least $500 million in the two months since Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's government started guaranteeing their bonds, freeing up money to help restore finances battered by the credit crunch.        Macquarie Group Ltd., Australia's largest investment bank, and six other lenders sold more than $34.4 billion of state- backed notes since Nov. 28, when the AAA rated government first backed their funding in a bid to thaw global credit markets frozen by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.'s bankruptcy.        Bank debt "offers extremely good value for a broad range of investors," said Peter Scobie, who helps manage $32.5 billion in fixed-income securities and cash as head of credit at Queensland Investment Corp. in Brisbane.        Australian banks cut at least 2 percentage points off their dollar bond yields and about 1 percentage point from local currency and yen debt since the guarantee began, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lenders including National Australia Bank Ltd. were forced to pay as much as 8.5 percent for five-year bonds last year, the data show.        Macquarie raised about $7 billion since November from bonds yielding as much as 5.8 percentage points less than dollar- denominated notes it sold without government backing.  After paying a fee for the guarantee, the Sydney-based bank saved about $278 million in interest payments on its $5.8 billion of fixed- rate dollar notes, Bloomberg data show.                                  'Big Gift'            "If I was Macquarie, and not having to worry about media attention, I'd buy back existing non-guaranteed debt at a huge discount and book a profit right now," said Guthrie Williamson, a Sydney-based money manager with Principal Global Investors, which oversees $228 billion. "The government has given Macquarie a big gift."         Craig Shapiro, an executive director in Macquarie's treasury department, declined to comment.        The Australian government today said it will spend A$42 billion ($26.8 billion) on grants and infrastructure, doubling its economic stimulus package, as the global financial crisis pushes the A$1 trillion economy to the brink of recession.        The economy grew 0.1 percent in the third quarter, the weakest pace in eight years. Unemployment climbed to a two-year high of 4.5 percent in December and home-building approvals plunged by the most since 2002.        Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens today cut the benchmark interest rate by 1 percentage point to 3.25 percent, a 45-year low.                                  Loan Fund           Australia's government may establish a fund to lend directly to companies should foreign banks fail to roll over as much as   A$75 billion of maturing debt, Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner said on Jan. 22. The fund would be used if foreign banks withdraw from the Australian market and domestic banks can't meet the shortfall, he said.        Local banks may need to sell A$60 billion more bonds this year to cope with an estimated A$100 billion of maturing debt, Sydney-based Deutsche Bank AG analysts Gus Medeiros, Colin Tan and Ken Crompton wrote in a research note on Jan. 13.        Westpac Banking Corp., Australia's biggest lender by market value, sold 245 billion yen ($2.7 billion) of bonds yesterday including the first samurai bonds since Lehman's collapse, Bloomberg data show. The "big surprise" was that the guarantee helped Westpac achieve the fifth-biggest samurai sale on record in a time of economic crisis, said Tetsuo Ishihara, a senior credit analyst with Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo.        Samurai bonds are yen-denominated notes sold in Japan by non-Japanese borrowers.                               Yield Differential           Macquarie in December sold $1.2 billion of government guaranteed bonds maturing in 2010 to yield 1.98 percent while its   4.16 percent non-guaranteed senior unsecured bonds traded at a   7.8 percent yield, Bloomberg data show. Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., based in Melbourne, raised $1.25 billion from state-backed bonds on Dec. 9 to yield 3.24 percent when its similar-maturity securities without sovereign backing traded at   5.24 percent, the data show.        In the U.S., New York-based Citigroup Inc. priced $3.75 billion of bonds backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Dec. 2 to yield 2.96 percent while its $2 billion non-guaranteed notes were trading at about 7 percent.                              'Very Encouraging'           "Overall market activity in the guaranteed funding space has been very encouraging," Rick Moscati, group treasurer for ANZ, Australia's fourth-biggest bank, said in a phone interview from Melbourne. "We are now ahead of the run rate for our annual term-funding target, having already raised slightly over 50 percent of the annual target for the year ending September."        Bank of Queensland Ltd. borrowed all it needs for 2009 after raising A$500 million from its first government-guaranteed bond sale last month, attracting more than A$700 million in a few hours from about 20 investors, according to Chief Financial Officer Ram Kangatharan.        The Brisbane-based lender sold floating-rate notes maturing in October 2011 paying 115 basis points above the three-month Australian bank bill swap rate of 3.4 percent, Bloomberg data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.        "New government-guaranteed bond sales are likely to be priced at close to current levels with a slight potential for tightening," said John Sorrell, head of credit with Tyndall Investment Management, which oversees A$14 billion of fixed- income assets. "The spate of supply could see the market become saturated."
