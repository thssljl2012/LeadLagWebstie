If the RBA is going to maintain any credibility with regards to the inflation targetting regime they must raise rates next month. There can be no doubt here - there is no point in the RBA claiming a 1-3 band if they just abandon it when ever the upper limit is pushed. The RBA likes to release lots of discussion papers about the importance of "credibility when a policy makers adopts a targetting rule" - lets see if they stick with it.          Quote:                         Inflation surge pressures interest rates      http://www.news.com.au/business/stor...-31037,00.html       The Reserve Bank looks set to raise interest rates next month, after the inflation rate rose to a 16-year high, which would take borrowing costs to a 12-year high.   Underlying inflation, which is the preferred measure of living costs by the Reserve Bank of Australia, amounted to a quarterly rise of 1.05 per cent and an annual increase of 3.6 per cent.   The average annual underlying inflation rate was the highest since the September quarter of 1991, when the rate was 4.4 per cent   Market economists had expected the average of the two measures to rise by 0.8 per cent in the December quarter for an annual rate of 3.3 per cent.   The headline CPI rose 0.9 per cent in the December quarter, for an annual rate of 3.0 per cent.    Rate rise coming     Commonwealth Bank of Australia senior economist John Peters said the RBA appeared set to raise the official cash rate in February by 25 basis point, to 7 per cent, following the bigger than expected jump in inflation.   "It's much worst than expected by the markets,'' he said.   "Despite the volatility on global markets in the US, and the 75 basis point cut (to US interest rates) we think the case is there for the Reserve Bank to move on rates given the upbeat economic outlook despite the global volatility.   "As expressed by (RBA) governor (Glenn) Stevens, these numbers pave the way for another rate rise in February.''   Mr Peters said higher petrol prices, capacity constraints and a tight labour market after 17 years of economic growth were increasing inflationary pressures.   Healthier economic growth prospects in China and India were expected to keep local economic growth prospects strong as demand for commodities holds up, Mr Peters said.    Timing uncertain     National Australia Bank senior economist Spiros Papadopoulos said the RBA was more likely to raise interest rates in March rather than February given financial market volatility.     "A February increase cannot be ruled out completely, but it is less likely given the current financial environment,'' he said.     "However the most likely timing of another rate hike would be at the March meeting, as a further upward move will require some settling down of financial markets.     "The high (December quarter CPI) result maintains the prospect of another 25 basis points rate increase," he said.
