If the money goes into the bank then it needs to be re-lent, thus there is a lag in spending. Banks do lend every day but there is a lead time before new loans are approved and fresh deposits are not lent out immediately. If consumers are cutting back on spending, which would be indicative of Rudd's target group saving their handouts, then there will not be the demand to borrow more from the banks to spend  (ie: people not receiving the handout will not want to increase their debt burden)  hence there will not be an effective economic stimulus. Increasing purchases of an existing stock of housing does not have a large economic benefit.  There is a shortfall in supply of housing and this is currently not improving                       They were your conclusions, not ANZ's!   First home buyers may not be getting handout but will want to borrow   Housing supply will only increase once buyers return(lower interest rates, FHOG etc)
