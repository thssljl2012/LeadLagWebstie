   Australia's central bank minutes reinforces tightening bias         SYDNEY (Thomson Financial) -  Australia's central bank  considered raising its cash target rate by a bigger margin than a quarter percentage point hike to 7.00 percent announced on February 5. Minutes from the February meeting of the  Reserve Bank of Australia 's (RBA) board, released Tuesday, showed the board had opted for a quarter percentage rise rather than a half percentage point even though it believed that the nation's inflation outlook had deteriorated since its last meeting in December.      The release showed the RBA decided on the quarter percentage rise as borrowers had already suffered rate rises independent of the central bank as commercial banks sought to recover some of the higher costs associated with the global credit crunch. 'Global credit and equity markets, which the board considered carefully, had also been unsettled over recent weeks, and the working out of the financial difficulties of the major international financial institutions had some way to run,' the minutes stated. The RBA board judged that the case for the 25-basis-point rise was more persuasive though the judgement was finely balanced, according to the minutes.      The minutes said the board would continue to review whether policy was sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to its 2-3 percent target within a reasonable period. In the final quarter of 2007,  core inflation  was around 3.5 percent.      Economists believed the minutes, as well as hawkish view expressed in the RBA's quarterly monetary statement released last week, means the central bank is likely to hike its cash target rate again after its March 4 policy meeting. 'We continue to expect a March tightening, and while 25 basis points is more likely given the continued deterioration in credit markets, 50 basis points can't be ruled out,' said John Edwards, chief economist at HSBC Australia &amp; New Zealand.
