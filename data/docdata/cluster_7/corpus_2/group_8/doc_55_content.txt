  Australian dollar forecast lowered by NAB Capital to 80-88 US cents from 96        SYDNEY (Thomson Financial) - NAB Capital said Friday it has drastically revised down its  forecast for the Australian dollar against the greenback  this year to between 80-88 US cents from 96 US cents previously on expectations the global credit crisis and worsening economic outlook will weigh on the currency.      ''Our earlier view that the Australian dollar will trade up to a fresh cycle high of 96 US cents in 2008 looks most unlikely as  the credit crunch  has persisted and started to weigh on global growth prospects, challenging the decoupling story,'' said John Kyriakopoulos, head of currency strategy at NAB Capital.      Many currency strategists increased their forecasts for the Australian dollar to around 95 US cents in October when the currency punched above 90 US cents for the first time since it was floated in 1984, as robust economic growth in Australia boosted the chances of the Reserve Bank tightening interest rates.      Since then the global economic stage has changed.      The credit crisis has persisted and is now posing a significant downside risk to the Australian dollar given Australia's large current account deficit, said Kyriakopoulos.      ''In recent years, foreign purchases of debt securities issued by Australian banks have provided 90 percent of total portfolio capital inflows. If the credit crunch persists beyond the March quarter of 2008 and banks' offshore issuance shrinks further, this will make it much more difficult to fund the large current account deficit at current exchange rates,'' he said.      ''Should this alarming scenario play out then the Australian dollar could fall more sharply than our current forecasts envisage, to potentially well below 80 US cents.''      There are also increasing concerns the US economy will slip into recession this year, taking the global economy with it, which would see commodity prices and the Australian dollar fall.      Furthermore, NAB Capital believes Australia's economic growth and underlying consumer price inflation will slow this year, reducing the chances of the Reserve Bank of Australia raising interest rates.      The Reserve cut interest rates by a cumulative half a percentage point to 6.75 percent in August and November as inflation moved to the higher end of its target range. Many economists have been predicting another rate rise in February.      ''Admittedly, there's a risk that the RBA maintains the current level of interest rates for longer than expected if the global slowdown turns out to be modest, commodity prices remain elevated, and the new Federal Government fails to rein in spending in its May budget,'' said Kyriakopoulos.      ''With inflation still the most pressing concern for the RBA, we suspect that it will need evidence of a marked slowdown in growth before it takes its foot off the brake. This argues against a steep fall in the Australian dollar.''
