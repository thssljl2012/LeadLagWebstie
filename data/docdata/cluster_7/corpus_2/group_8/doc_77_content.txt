Might want to work on that memory a little Dry Rot - I'm sure you posted something about it at the time but can't be bothered finding it     http://news.ninemsn.com.au/business/...-on-card-bills        Australians chose to use a large slice of their $8.7 billion pre-Christmas government handouts to pay down their credit cards bills, new central bank figures show.   The value of credit card repayments rose by $3.9 billion in December - the biggest monthly increase by value since Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) records began in 1994.  Australians spent $21.464 billion on credit card repayments in December, which was more than the $21.043 billion spent on credit card transactions, the RBA data released on Thursday found.  CommSec economist Savanth Sebastian said most of the federal government's December fiscal stimulus handout was not spent, which meant a fair amount went towards credit card repayments.  "The government wanted it going back to the economy and having a multiplier effect, but in this environment, of falling property prices and share market wealth, people are using that to pay down debt levels and ensure they're in the best possible position for a rainy day," he said.  Nomura chief economist Stephen Roberts said the handouts from the government's new $42 billion fiscal stimulus package were also likely to be used to pay off debt.  "Credit card interest rates are still very, very high ... clearly nobody has any incentive to pay 20 per cent interest," Mr Roberts said.  "With rising unemployment, paying exorbitantly high real interest rates makes no sense."  The RBA data was compiled in the same month the government gave $1,000-plus cheques to parents and pensioners as part of a fiscal stimulus package totalling $10.4 billion.  Farmers, students and low-to-middle income earners are due to receive $900 cheques by Easter as part of a $12 billion handout from the government's new $42 billion infrastructure and welfare package.  The average plastic card debt stood at $3,162 at the end of 2008, with debt growing at three per cent annually - the slowest pace on record.  The RBA data also showed credit card repayments jumped by 22.2 per cent in December, the biggest monthly percentage increase since May 2006.  Total transactions rose by 19.4 per cent in December, the biggest monthly gain in almost three years, the RBA data showed.  In the same month, Australian retail sales rose by a  seasonally adjusted 3.8 per cent.          Looks like they paid the cards off in December and probably spent up in January
