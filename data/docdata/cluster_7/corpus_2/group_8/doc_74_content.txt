If you criticise something shouldn't you have something solid to back it up??   In life when someone expresses an opinion to you do you criticise their view based on nothing more that a hunch?                      Feb. 9 (Bloomberg) -- Australias planned A$42 billion ($28 billion) stimulus is too large for an economy that has held up better than many of its global counterparts, said  central bank board member Warwick McKibbin .       Australia is very well placed to withstand the shock which is currently emanating from the world economy, McKibbin, an economist at Australian National University, told a Senate inquiry in Canberra today. This suggests that the scale of the Australian response should be less than the world average.       Prime Minister Kevin Rudds spending package will push the governments budget into a A$22.5 billion deficit this fiscal year, the first shortfall in seven years and the largest as a percentage of gross domestic product since 1995-1996, according to Treasury forecasts. Australia has announced almost A$89 billion in relief measures since mid-September, which in total are equivalent to about 9 percent of GDP.       The current package is too large at this stage of the global economic slowdown, McKibbin said. Given the circumstances in Australia, the package should be less than the 2 percent of GDP average stimulus recommended by the International Monetary Fund.       Japans 10 trillion yen ($111 billion) economic package is worth about 2 percent of its economy and the U.S.s $819 billion stimulus is equivalent to around 6 percent of the worlds biggest economy.       Australias economy grew 1.9 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier. By comparison, Japans economy contracted 0.5 percent in the same period and the U.S. shrank 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.       Personal View       McKibbin, who has been on the Reserve Bank of Australias board since July 2001, said his testimony was his personal view and not one that could be attributed to the central bank.       Australia does not yet have a domestic financial crisis, but it does face a substantial reduction in exports and substantial decline in the wealth of its citizens, he said. The first job for this package should be to help restore confidence.       Voter support for Rudds Labor government increased after the package was unveiled, according to a Newspoll published in the Australian newspaper today. Support for Labor rose four percentage points to 58 percent, according to a poll of 1,133 people. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.       The stimulus plan includes A$12.7 billion in grants to families and lower-income earners and A$28.8 billion in extra spending on infrastructure.       Tax Cuts       The main problem I see is the cash payment; I would replace the intent of these payments by bringing forward tax cuts already legislated for future years, McKibbin said.       Australia should be in the position to offer additional fiscal stimulus, if it needs to, he added.       The A$42 billion package, which passed parliaments lower house last week, is before an inquiry in the upper house Senate ahead of a vote to be taken on Feb. 12. The government needs the support of either the Liberal-National coalition or seven minor party Senators to pass the legislation.
