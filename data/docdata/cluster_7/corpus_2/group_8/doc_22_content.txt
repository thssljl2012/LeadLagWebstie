  Recession looms as companies slash inventories; boosts case for rate cut       Australian firms ran down inventories at the fastest pace in 22 years last quarter, dramatically increasing the risk of an outright contraction in the economy and adding to the case for more rate cuts.      Monday's figures from the government also showed company profits sank 6.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, while a private survey showing Australian manufacturing activity hit record lows in February as demand slumped.      "The figures were awful," said Rob Henderson, chief economist markets at nabCapital.      "We calculate that inventories took around 1.3 percentage points from growth. Without a huge rise from net exports, gross domestic product (GDP) will be negative."      Inventories fell 1.9 per cent in the fourth quarter, confounding expectations of a 0.3 per cent rise and the biggest drop since 1986.      This represented a subtraction from GDP of $3.6 billion ($US2.3 billion), or about 1.3 percentage points, when analysts had looked for a drag of just 0.2 percentage points. That was a hard blow since GDP had been expected to have risen by 0.1 per cent in the quarter, from the previous quarter. The data are due out on Wednesday, just a day after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) holds its monthly policy meeting.      "It's ugly on the face of it," said John Peters, a senior economist at Commonwealth Bank. "It means all the risks are to the downside and GDP could be substantially weaker now."      The risk of a sizable fall in GDP could prompt the central bank to cut its 3.25 per cent cash rate at its meeting on Tuesday, even though it has been hinting it would like to pause after lowering its cash rate by 400 basis points since September.      Why wait?      "We had thought they might skip March and move again in April," Mr Peters said.      "But with numbers like these, and dismal news abroad, you have to wonder why they would wait."
