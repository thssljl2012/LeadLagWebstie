Interesting to compare the way today's almost identical employment figures were reported in 2007, story is similar - headlines much less dramatic (this is from ninemsn)               Unemployment rate rises marginally         15/01/2009 3:51:11 PM                                The highest jobless rate in almost two years is a taste of what is to come as the economy and business conditions deteriorate further in 2009, economists say.  Almost 44,000 full-time jobs were shed in December, Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data showed.  The drop in full-time staff numbers was the biggest monthly fall in almost six years, fuelling concerns that bosses are cutting back employment hours to cope with a downturn.  The unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points to 4.5 per cent in December, ABS data showed, marking the highest jobless rate since March 2007.  As recently as February, the unemployment rate was at a 34-year low of 3.9 per cent.  Annual jobs growth slowed to 1.3 per cent in December, a level well below February's peak of three per cent.  In December, overall employment fell by a seasonally adjusted 1,200, a figure less dire than market forecasts of 20,000 job losses.  But this included a 43,900 fall in full-time employment, the steepest drop since March 2003, offset by an increase of 42,800 in part-time jobs.  CommSec economist Savanth Sebastian said signs of rising unemployment showed the Australian economy was "not immune from what is going on overseas".  He described the big drop in full-time employment as a "big concern".  "There's no doubt that employers at the moment are certainly not hiring any new staff and whatever staff they currently have on board they are moving to a much more flexible workforce," Mr Sebastian said.  "Cost-cutting is certainly in vogue."  ICAP senior economist Adam Carr said while jobs growth was likely to flatten in coming months, employers would be more likely to limit the creation of new jobs rather than retrench staff.  "We can take some comfort that the labour market seems to be holding up OK all things considered," he said.  "Looking forward, I still believe this downturn will be characterised more so by an absence of job creation rather than mass job shedding."  Citigroup managing director of economics Paul Brennan said a weakening labour market would lead to the jobless rate to rise to six per cent by the end of 2009.  Mr Brennan said the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) would cut official interest rates from a present 4.25 per cent to 1960s levels at three per cent by March.  South Australia had the nation's highest jobless rate of 5.3 per cent in December, with NSW on 5.2 per cent.  The former commodities-boom state of Western Australia had the lowest unemployment rate of 2.8 per cent.  Meanwhile, the national participation rate fell by 0.1 percentage points to 65 per cent.
