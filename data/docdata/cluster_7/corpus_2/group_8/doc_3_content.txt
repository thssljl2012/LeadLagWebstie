Looks like the arse clown Big 4 economists are finally waking up to what's actually happening:           Quote:                         Unhappy New Year   Chris Zappone   January 9, 2009 - 1:39PM      Aussies returning to work from the beach or the bush would have hoped that 2009 might bring some relief from last year's unrelenting torment of bad economic news.      No such joy.      Instead, just days into the new year, economists are seeing enough grim portents in the first batches of official data to review their prognoses of the economy's health.      ANZ senior economist Katie Dean may be the first out of the blocks, saying yesterday's woeful figures for new building approvals prompted the bank to slice more than a third off its growth forecast for Australia's gross domestic product growth.        "Building approvals is a leading indicator for activity, so that has caused us to make around a 0.25% (cut) from growth over 2009," said Ms Dean.      ANZ Bank currently expects 2009 GDP growth of 0.4%, "with the risk of recession looming large."      Westpac, too, may move to lower their forecasts in the wake of the 13% slump in building approvals in November alone. Since houses on average take three months to build, the plunge is likely to reverberate through the first three months of 2009, said Westpac senior economist Andrew Hanlan.      ''I suspect most people wouldn't have fully factored that sort of drop into their (growth) forecast,'' Mr Hanlan said.      Before any revisions, Westpac now forecasts GDP growth of 0.2% in the first three months of 2009. The economy eked out an 0.1% expansion in the third quarter of 2008, according to the latest official figures available....         For economists such as JPMorgan's Helen Kevans, the actual volumes of exports, when released on January 23rd, may trigger reductions in overall growth forecasts for the fourth quarter.      JPMorgan currently forecasts a quarterly 0.5% GDP contraction for the final three months of 2008. Ms Kevans doesn't expect to adjust her estimate until she can measure "how much the fall in export and imports values - that we saw yesterday - was due to falling prices and how much was due to falling volumes.''      For now, JPMorgan has a first-quarter GDP forecast of a contraction of 0.2%, implying the economy will fall into a recession for the first time in about 17 years, based on the standard definition of such a downturn as two consecutive quarters of contraction.....                      http://business.smh.com.au/business/...0109-7dal.html
