 WASHINGTON, March 23 (Reuters)  -   The U.S. government fleshed out a plan on   Monday it hopes can purge banks of up to $1 trillion in   toxic   assets, a key   element of its drive to pull the world's biggest economy out of a deep   recession.             News of the scheme, which seeks to woo private investors with public   funding, lifted stock markets, despite doubts over private sector participation   and questions about who -- banks or taxpayers -- will end up paying the most for   the clean-up.           The plan to rid banks' balance sheets of bad loans and securities that   thwart lending is central to President Barack Obama's effort to revive the   economy with stimulus spending, a financial sector clean-up and regulatory   reform.           The stakes are also high for the rest of the world, with the global   economy mired in its deepest slump since the 1930s Great Depression and many   nations counting on a U.S. recovery to kick-start their export-dependent   economies.           Just hours after Washington released details of the plan it got a vote of   confidence from China, the biggest holder of U.S. government debt, which said it   would continue to buy U.S. Treasuries.           Initially, the Treasury will tip in $75 billion to $100 billion to launch   the scheme, taking the money from the $700 billion financial rescue fund   approved in October, according to an Obama administration official.             The government money would be put alongside private capital and then   leveraged up to $500 billion, or possibly double that amount, with the help of   the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, a U.S. bank regulator, and the Federal   Reserve.           All in all, under the plan, the government will provide the lion's share   of the funding to buy up soured assets.           One of the world's largest asset managers, BlackRock, expressed interest   in taking part in the scheme as manager of one of the public-private funds due   to be created under the plan.                      BONUS RAGE           But public rage at Wall Street and lawmakers efforts to claw back bonuses   paid by companies rescued with public funds fuelled concerns that private   investors may shy away from the plan.           "Investors will be very wary of committing capital at the same time as   Congress is vilifying Wall Street on bonuses," said Sean Callow, currency   strategist at Westpac in Sydney.           Yet the initial market reaction was positive, reflecting relief that a   long-awaited key part of Obama's economic rescue was taking shape.           "Given the extent of the crisis in the U.S. banking sector, this is an   essential step to restoring confidence, if carried out correctly," said Annette   Beacher, senior strategist with TD Securities in Sydney.           Japan's Nikkei average rose 3.4 percent to its highest close in seven   weeks, brushing off a further slide in manufacturing sentiment, and Asian stocks   elsewhere jumped 3.7 percent to a two-month high.            Currencies that were sold off heavily during bouts of market volatility,   such as the Australian dollar or sterling , also rose.            The euro climbed to a five-month high against the yen after European   Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said euro zone rates were already low   and the ECB might turn to unconventional measures to get credit flowing again.                       CRUNCH TIME           The toxic debt plan comes at a crunch time for Obama, who prepares to   meet fellow leaders of the world's top 20 economies at a financial summit in   London on April 2 and struggles to contain public anger over big bonuses paid by   insurer AIG that has been bailed out with $180 billion in taxpayer money.           The new White House team is also trying to win support for Obama's record   $3.5 trillion 2010 budget plan.           Concerns that record government spending and hefty liquidity injections   by the U.S. Federal Reserve will create a global glut of dollars, hit the U.S.   currency last week and led some analysts question its role as the world's main   reserve currency.           But Hu Xiaolian, China's deputy central bank governor told a briefing   ahead of the Group of 20 summit next month that Beijing would not be swayed by   short-term market volatility.            Hu said China still considered U.S. Treasuries as low risk investment and   would continue to buy U.S. debt as part of its strategy of managing the world's   biggest reserve stockpile of roughly $2 trillion.            One part of the plan would see the Treasury provide 50-80 percent of the   equity capital needed to set up a fund, and the FDIC would lend the partnership   up to six times the amount of its combined capital.           Another part aimed at taking mortgage-related securities off bank books   would let up to five investment managers put up money, with the government   matching it dollar-for-dollar and then providing debt equal to half the combined   fund.           "The real challenge would be in pricing these toxic assets," said Linus   Yip, strategist, First Shanghai Securities, Hong Kong.           "If the government and banks can reach an agreement on that, then there's   a pretty good chance the credit market will return to normal."
