Gee once again, the 'experts' are shocked by the speed of the down-turn!  Come on Col and Jimmy time to get the pom poms out.              Building approvals diveChris Zappone   January 8, 2009 - 11:34AM    New home building approvals dived the most in six years in November as buyers remained on the sidelines in spite of the Government's stimulus package and hefty interest rate cuts. New South Wales bucked the trend.      - Approvals drop 35% from year ago   - Building activity hits new low   - Trade surplus halves      Building approvals fell 13%, seasonally adjusted, to 9581 in November, down from 10,730 in October, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said today.      The market forecast was for building approvals to shrink 1.5% in November alone. From a year earlier, the tally plummeted 35%.      ''It's far worse than any of the forecasts for the November month,'' said Paul Braddock, ANZ Bank housing economist. ''And I think it's led a lot of people to revise downwards their residential building activity numbers for the March quarter,'' and will affect predictions of GDP growth, he said.      Combined with the shrinking November trade surplus, released today, there will be no shortage of constraints on Australia's economic growth.      Government stimulus      The decline came one month after the Federal Government announced a $10.4 billion stimulus package aimed in large part at prospective home buyers.      The Reserve Bank had also sliced 2 percentage points off interest rates by the end of November, taking the cash rate to 5.25%, in another effort to ignite demand. The central bank slashed rates further last month, to 4.25%.      All the positive factors have been more than offset by the economic uncertainty and questions about the availability of credit to developers, Mr Braddock said.      "It's one of the ugliest numbers we've seen for quite some time," he said, adding that "we can't say we've seen the bottom yet."      NSW advances, WA sinks      New South Wales, where the housing market has struggled for months, recorded a gain of 2.3% in total approvals, seasonally adjusted, for November.      The mining states, linked closely with resources economy, bore the brunt of the plunge in building approvals.      Western Australia's approvals plummeted 29.5%, while Queensland's dropped 15.9%.      Victoria's fell 10.2% in November, with Tasmania and South Australia's declining 4.6% and 1.3%, respectively.      Apartment approvals 'smashed'      Within the ABS building approvals figures, the "other'' dwelling sector, which includes units and apartments, was down 21.9% in November, seasonally adjusted.      Building approvals for multi-unit dwellings "have been smashed'', falling more than half of where they were in November of 2007, Mr Braddock said.      Private home building dropped 9.7% in November, or 27% for the year.      More weakness ahead      "There's no other way to describe them than awful,'' said nabCapital chief economist Rob Henderson, referring to the overall building approval numbers.      Mr Henderson said the drop in the more volatile apartment building figures took economists by surprise, leading the overall tally to a sharp fall.      But even the private home building, considered a "less volatile'' figure, was down significantly.      "I still expect the measures taken at the end of the year, including rate cuts and fiscal package, should lead to an increase in building.      "We're expecting this to be the worst quarter,'' said Mr Henderson, although there was a possibility of some more weakness in the first quarter of 2009.      Construction outlook gloomy      The outlook for construction has shown few signs of perking up in spite of the government and central bank's efforts to jump-start the sector.      The Australian Industry Group-Housing Industry Association performance of construction index slumped to a new low in December, easing 1.1 points to 30.9 December, from 32 points in November, according to numbers also released today.      The index has languished below the 50 point mark separating growth from contraction for the tenth consecutive month in December, underscoring the protracted nature of the slowdown.      The mining states      Homebuyers in the resource states are also facing a weaker outlook for revenues, underscored by today's plunging trade surplus figures, released today by the ABS.      The country's exports contracted 4% in the month and imports rose 2%, reducing the overall balance for goods and services to a surplus of $1.45 billion. Economists had expected a trade surplus of about $2 billion.      ''In what will be a negative result for net exports - and economic growth - much of the fall in mining exports was due to large reductions in volumes rather than falls in prices - yet the latter is also on the way,'' said ANZ economist Alex Joiner in a note to clients.       czappone@fairfax.com.au        BusinessDay
