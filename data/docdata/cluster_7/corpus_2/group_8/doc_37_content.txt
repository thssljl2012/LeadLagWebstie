If only I got paid what these blokes did        Recession set to start: forecaster   Peter Martin and Tim Colebatch    October 30, 2008    THE Australian economy is already going into reverse and could be officially in recession within months, according to alarming new assessments from leading forecasters.      In a dramatic shift of outlook, investment bank JP Morgan yesterday became the first major forecaster to say the economy will contract in this quarter and the next  satisfying one of the most common definitions of recession.      The firm sent its gloomy forecast to clients early yesterday. Within hours, another forecaster, Deutsche Bank, revealed it was also expecting the economy to contract in the current quarter despite the Government's $10.4 billion economic stimulus package, much of which will hit consumers' pockets in December.      JP Morgan Australia chief economist Stephen Walters told The Age he did not expect the fiscal stimulus package to have much impact.      "The way consumers are feeling right now, with recession levels of confidence, with equity markets having fallen 40%, with funds frozen all over the country  with consumers now worried about their job prospects, why would you rush out and spend $1000 that the Government sends out in a nice little cheque to you?"      Mr Walters expects Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) to slide by 0.3% during the current quarter and by 0.4% in March quarter.      But he predicts the economy will resume growing in the second and third quarters of 2009, making this recession much milder and shorter than the extended downturn of the early 1990s.      While not explicitly predicting recession, other economists spoken to by The Age were similarly gloomy. "That forecast (from JP Morgan) is not too far from consensus," said Philip Adams, an economic modeller who runs the Centre for Policy Studies at Monash University.      Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said it was very unlikely the economy would contract in the current quarter. But he said: "We are expecting zero growth in the March quarter and then only very small growth as the effect of the stimulus dies away."      National Australia Bank chief economist Alan Oster said: "Growth will be low, no doubt about that. We don't think it will be a recession, but it might feel like one."      Meanwhile, as fallout continued from the bank deposit guarantee, major players in Australia's wealth management industry rejected the Government's suggestion that frozen mortgage funds become banks, saying the measure would not help the tens of thousands of retirees who have lost access to almost $14 billion in savings.      AXA Asia Pacific, which has suspended redemptions on its Australian Monthly Income Fund, said: "AXA does not see becoming an authorised deposit-taking institution as a solution to this issue for our customers."      Australian Unity, which has suspended two funds, said the offer was nothing new. "Any organisation could have chosen to do that last week or the week before," said head of investments David Bryant.      Earlier, Treasurer Wayne Swan said some of the mortgage funds that have suspended withdrawals by investors were interested in converting themselves into banks.      Mr Swan also sought to divert blame for the funds' plight from the Government, saying 10 funds had already suspended redemptions before the Government promised to guarantee all bank deposits  causing investors to take their money out of funds to put in the bank.      Federal Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull expressed serious reservations that Mr Rudd's proposal could work.      "Take a cash management trust or a mortgage fund, for it to turn itself into a bank, or an authorised deposit taker, is a very complex and expensive exercise," Mr Turnbull said.      "It would have to raise a lot of capital  with the difficulties we see in this market at the moment, it would be extremely challenging for a fund to raise that sort of capital.         FORECAST: GLOOMY      JP MORGAN says the economy will contract in this quarter and the next  a technical definition of a recession.      DEUTSCHE BANK is also expecting contraction in the current quarter.      FUNDS PLAN PANNED   AXA ASIA PACIFIC "AXA does not see becoming an authorised deposit-taking institution as a solution to this issue for our customers."      AUSTRALIAN UNITY "It's a useful offer but in practical terms it's not really one that we see we could take up in this current market."      With BEN DOHERTY, RUTH WILLIAMS
