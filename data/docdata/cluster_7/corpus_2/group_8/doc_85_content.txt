Here is a selection of your comments showing you were being a smart arse and wrong.       Quote:                         Australia will avoid recession: survey    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    The following organisations have said, while Australians growth will slow substantially, it will not fall into (a technical) recession;  OECD, IMF, World Bank, RBA, WestPac, Treasury and there are probably others.    Now either all those organisations are incompetent or lying, because its clear they don't have the 'secret' information only available to a select few paying clients.    Morges, I believe you do have the information you say you have, so it opens up an interesting debate.  "Why are all those organisations all saying something different to your secret information?"    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    And yet still none of the "name players" are predicting a recession for Australia, its only the "secret societies" that are, and they are doing it with information not privileged to most of us.    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    In the Annual Economic Survey in today's Age.  Of the 22 economists who were surveyed only 2 predict Australia will have negative growth this year.  One predicted zero growth and the remainder predicted positive growth.  Two predicted growth in excess of 2%  The average of all 22 was 0.7% growth.    Surely these people should start to read BigFooty to get the real truth about economics    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    BF posters in the majority (unequivocally) have said Australia will go into recession.  None of those same posters predicted the current crises.  A multitude of evidence says we will not go into recession.  But I am told by you, to trust and believe the likes of you who admit they have no real knowledge or qualifications in economics.
