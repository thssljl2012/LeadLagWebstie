   Dollar falls below 100 yen, hits new record low vs euro         LONDON (Thomson Financial) - The    dollar      fell below 100 yen to reach a 12-year low this morning, while the   euro   hit a new record high above 1.56 against the US currency as recession fears sparked a fresh bout of risk aversion.  'This is a market that is focused on risk more than return and sentiment remains significantly negative that the market is wary about taking on board excessive risk,' said Divyang Shah at Commonwealth Bank.      The dollar dipped briefly below the 100    yen    level for the first time since November 1995 to reach a low of 99.75.  Speculation that the Bank of Japan could step in to intervene  at these levels meant it failed to hold below 100, however.      The    Swiss franc    was another focus of safe-haven buying, with the dollar hitting a low of 1.0043 sfr, sparking talk of a breach of parity.      The    euro    also benefited from broad dollar weakness meanwhile, breaching the 1.56 usd mark to hit a  fresh record high of 1.5625 usd.   The latest gains came as the  European Central Bank  continued to give no hint whatsoever that it would deviate from its focus on combating inflation, suggesting it is still in no mood to cut interest rates to support growth.  In its March monthly bulletin, the ECB said its current level of interest rates will help to anchor inflation expectations in the euro zone.  'The firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority. The governing council believes that the current monetary policy stance will contribute to achieving this objective,' the ECB said.      Elsewhere, the    pound    also gained against the dollar, hitting a three-month high against the dollar of 2.0355 usd, though it stayed steady against the euro.         Dollar remains in the doldrums on fragile risk appetite         LONDON (Thomson Financial) - The dollar remained woefully weak as renewed gloom about the financial sector weighed on risk appetite, with  the yen trading to its highest level against the US currency for 12 years.       News that  a major US hedge fund is unable to meet margin calls  fuelled a renewed bout of risk aversion on Wall Street yesterday which has pervaded through to European markets this morning.      Analysts said  market players are becoming increasingly pessimistic  about how well placed the Fed is to improve conditions in the credit markets, with the relief following Tuesday's coordinated central bank money market operations fading fast.  'The ability of Fed interest rate cuts and liquidity injections to support risky assets is diminishing rapidly, as underlined by the  temporary and limited response of markets to the liquidity measures announced on Tuesday ,' said analysts at Barclays Capital.      This pessimism has caused the dollar to fall below 100 yen for the first time in 12 years as investors looked to safe-haven currencies to act as a store of value, although it has since clawed back some of its losses.  'This is a market that is focused on risk more than return and sentiment remains significantly negative that the market is wary about taking on board excessive risk,' said Divyang Shah at Commonwealth Bank.      Later today comes the release of the  weekly US jobless claims figures , along with  preliminary retail sales  for February.  The retail sales figures are expected to bring fresh gloom about the US high street, with growth seen slowing to 0.2 pct from January's 0.3 pct.  'After two consecutive months of negative payrolls, all we need to tick the final box on the recession checklist is some very weak sales data - it is possible that this is on its way today,' said Rob Carnell at ING.      The  Swiss franc was another focus of safe-haven buying , with the dollar hitting a low of 1.0043 sfr, sparking talk of a breach of parity.      Meanwhile,  the euro remained in buoyant mode , reaching a fresh all-time high of 1.5625 usd with the European Central Bank still not giving any hint that its focus will move from combating inflation to shoring up growth by cutting interest rates.  Yesterday, ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet described recent movements in currency markets as 'excessive' but investors are doubtful whether the central bank will intervene to stem the currency's ascendancy anytime soon.  'There is nothing new in Trichet's rhetoric so far, and the single currency continues to trade imperviously to verbal intervention by policymakers and business leaders alike,' said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at UBS.      Finally,  the pound was firmer , boosted by a survey showing  inflation expectations among the UK public hit record levels during February , further denting the case for any near-term interest rate cut from the Bank of England.  The quarterly survey by the BoE showed inflation expectations for the coming year climbed to 3.3 pct in February, the highest level since the survey began.  'This will clearly spook the  Monetary Policy Committee , increasing the chances that interest rates will remain on hold in April and perhaps even May too,' said Paul Dales, UK economist at Capital Economics.
