                                         Quote:                          Originally Posted by  dhukka                         I nearly fell off my chair laughing when I saw the title of today&amp;#039;s announcement by NAB.          The fact is NAB needs this capital to cushion the writeoffs coming down the pike. Assuming a 20$ issue price NAB will be issuing 150 million shares, a 9% dilution to existing shareholders, yeah that is something to happy about.                                             Quite surprised that they got what they were after here Dhukka, does that say anything at all? The worst US banks couldn&amp;#039;t even raise capital when they needed it.....or is it a reflection of the availability if capital now as compared to a month ago?      Cheers,         COz
