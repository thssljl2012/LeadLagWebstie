It is with the Westpac Bank, it is fixed for  3 years, I changed it to fixed 3 months ago.      $179,000.00 is fixed and $70,000.00 is variable.         What would be the best option? and what do you suggest I do?

If break costs are around $8000 then is it worth it in the end?....I&amp;#039;d say, ummm, your decision!   Maybe go variable for the time being and pay off as much as possible. You are restricted with fixed rate loans.      How long left on the fixed rate?   Who is it currently with as there could be other break/exit fees?
