All I personally need now is for Suncorp to pass on the whole 0.75% decrease. I&amp;#039;ll bet they don&amp;#039;t.                          Our home loan is also with SunCorp. I have to say they have always matched the cuts made by the big 4 banks, even though it is usually always about at least a week after the others have already done it. No complaints with them though. The home loan we have with them is still the most competitive packake about, over 3 years after taking out our loan with them.      I doubt any of the banks will pass on the .75%   They passed on 80% of the last 1% cut, and it looks like that is what they will be doing this time also, i.e. about .6% (CBA announced .58%)      As long as they keep cutting them rather than putting them up, we are happily watching our monthly interest bill dropping like a rock - it&amp;#039;s simply fantastic !
