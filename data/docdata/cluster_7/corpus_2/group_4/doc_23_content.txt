                           In this ANZ Bank report,                           it said                           &amp;quot;The total number of jobs advertised in major metropolitan                         newspapers and on the internet fell&amp;quot;                           down about 10% in the beginning.But it also                           newspaper ads down about 35% here in a year.So,what is the                         truths.                           It is amazing that PM Rudd said Oz can avoid recessions!!                                                    http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/property-and-jobs-fall--so-will-rates/2008/11/03/1225560738014.html                                                    http://www.anz.com/australia/support/library/aj/aj20081103.pdf                                                     The real weakness has been in newspaper advertising. Newspaper                         job advertisements fell 12.2%                          in the month of October and a re now                         down 34.7% in the past year . Annual growth in newspaper ads                         is now the weakest since 2001.
