 Found the Pascoe article in the Brisbane Times.        Banks offer treat or trick     Michael Pascoe   November 19, 2008 - 7:33AM      Either the market is offering some of the great buys of the decade or we&amp;#039;ve witnessed a complete collapse of trust in the chief executives of our cornerstone institutions.      Westpac touched a low yesterday of $15.30. At that price, Gail Kelly is promising to pay you an amazing pre-tax dividend of 13.25%.      ANZ fell as low as $12.65. At that price, Mike Smith is promising to pay an absolutely extraordinary pre-tax dividend of 15.35%.            Hmmm, Ralph Norris from CBA isn&amp;#039;t quoted in it...
