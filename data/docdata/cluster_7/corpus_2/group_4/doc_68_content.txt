          Which institutions were offering these lifetime trackers of under 0.5 per cent above base and who were they offering them to(anybody?), I seemed to have missed a trick with my 1.5% discount off a nasty variable rate?    mine is with Clydesdale (National Australia Bank) but HSBC and others were doing good deals. At the time you could get 2 year discounts actually below BOE base rate. Lots of people thought those were a better deal than lifetime deals that were at a modest premium to BOE. Lots of people were badly wrong.
