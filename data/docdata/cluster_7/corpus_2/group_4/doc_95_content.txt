 Check out the credit unions, they seem to be offering the best interest rates, compared to your usual banks such as ANZ, NAB, CBA.        Out of these 3, ANZ definitely had the best rate.  Wouldn&amp;#039;t have touched NAB with a ten foot pole, although have only had pleasure dealing with them with savings accounts.  CBA I have always found to be fee scroungers.         www.personalloan.com.au  _________________ I fought for my life for I am to survive         www.myspace.com/thequadbox         Rockin&amp;#039; your jocks
