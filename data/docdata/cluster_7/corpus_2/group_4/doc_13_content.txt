     Quote:                          High-risk home loans a thing of the past     November 19, 2008 - 8:54AM    Prospective homebuyers will find it hard to get no-deposit loans in the wake of the global credit crisis.    The Commonwealth Bank of Australia has banned no-deposit loans and the ANZ has tightened eligibility requirements.    JP Morgan banking analyst Brian Johnson says stricter lending standards are here to stay.    &amp;amp;quot;The era of getting very easy credit to buy a house is over,&amp;amp;quot; he told ABC Radio, adding the move could have negative implications for house prices.    Aussie Home Loans boss John Symond says the change signals a return to sensible lending practices.    &amp;amp;quot;Banks have got to have prudent lending,&amp;amp;quot; he told ABC Radio.    &amp;amp;quot;People buying home in Australia with little or no deposit is flawed process.                      http://news.theage.com.au/national/h...1119-6amp.html     You need a 10% deposit to get a loan from ANZ, and I think for both Commonwealth and ANZ you have to pay the LMI upfront (rather than it being capitalised into your loan). From what I understand, LMI has gone up too.
