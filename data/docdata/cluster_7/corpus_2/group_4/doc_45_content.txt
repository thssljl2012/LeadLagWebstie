Congratulations Belu on approaching cashflow neutral on P &amp;amp;amp; I!      Now RAMS have announced when will RHG announce?      Am keen to plug the new figures into my excel spreadsheet. If people haven&amp;#039;t done this type of analysis and are feeling a bit unsure about holding IP&amp;#039;s I suggest you take the time to do this (it is quite a reassuring exercise).      I have gross rental income less interest expense (interest only) across three properties for CBA loan, RAMS loan and RHG loan at current rates, then assuming RBA at 5%, 4% and 3% respectively (sensitivity analysis).       I am approaching positive on gross rental basis at the moment. With RBA at 3% it would be  about $18k positive on a gross rental basis and easily cashflow positive (i.e. net of all expenses).
