 I traded CBA over the last few days, (before the crash), and found it lacked volume (relative to other banks) and something was not right, people are selling and keeping it down, this was while ANZ and NAB took off with two 8% odd gains in a row. This may have been because of ABC learning coming up.      I&amp;#039;d say NAB, just because I think they have released a lot of their bad information.
