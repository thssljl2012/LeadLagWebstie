         Hi    Am I righht in thinking that Barclays works on Barclays base rate? Which is usually the same as BoE base but not guaranteed to be?   This is what they say   Barclays Bank Base Rate: Barclays Bank Base Rate follows the Bank of England Base Rate, which can go up or down and is announced by the Bank of England&amp;#039;s Monetary Policy Committee every month.
