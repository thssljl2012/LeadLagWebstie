  Hi - first post and I have checked previous discussions and I see there has been some discussion on this ... however I have a Barclays/Woolwich Life Time tracker. I just called them and have been told that there is no reason that BARCLAYS / WOOLWICH  have to pass on any rate reductions. I pointed out -   Barclays Bank Base Rate   Barclays Bank Base Rate follows the Bank of England Base Rate, which can go up or down and is announced by the Bank of England&amp;#039;s Monetary Policy Committee every month.     They said ... we are not obliged to follow or pass on any BoE rate drops.  I believe I have been missold - anyone else able to substantiate thos.   Thanks
