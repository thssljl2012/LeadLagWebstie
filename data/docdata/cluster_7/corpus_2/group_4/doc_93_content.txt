          Obviously I don&amp;#039;t want to incur anyone&amp;#039;s wrath by posting this elsewhere, but an analyst [Bruce Packard] who appears to be fairly well-regarded (perhaps by dint of having been bold enough to value B&amp;amp;amp;B at 0p?) has a piece out with a target price of 18p on RBS!  See  http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2008/11/13/18201/markets-liv... ...  Barclays Reduce  TP 140 HBOS Reduce  TP - 84 HSBC Add  TP 787 Lloyds Reduce - TP 133 RBS Reduce - TP 18 Standard Chartered Reduce - TP 650  Current RBS price - 53p (down 3p today)  Stuff like that makes me look a bull......  ee    Since you did not want to incur anybodies wrath ee why did you only post half of the story?  The other half being 18p is a 90% discount to book value and the very last bit of the article   The risk to our call is that if either the UK growth or margin prognosis is better than we think,  there could be substantial upside.    Perhaps next time you will qoute the full story and not simply half of it.
