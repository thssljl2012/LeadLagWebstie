      Well the RBA dropped rates again today .75% good news for mortgage holders somewhat.  I know I am happy with it to a degree, yes I am anxious about the global economy but this drop will help in paying the home loan. The bonus is I am still paying the rate it was before the 2 last drops so I am taking advantage and getting ahead, as well as the other extra money I had been throwing into it.  The CBA have already said they will pass on .58  Am hoping to hurry up and hear from my bank
