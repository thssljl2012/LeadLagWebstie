Hi Jennifer,      I asked...        All my rates are an 80bp discount to the standard variable rate.  My lending is about $1.2M which might help a bit, but it never hurts to ask.      And, following today&amp;#039;s rate cut by the RBA, I&amp;#039;ll probably end up back below 7% by the time WBC passes most of it on.      Cheers,   Michael
