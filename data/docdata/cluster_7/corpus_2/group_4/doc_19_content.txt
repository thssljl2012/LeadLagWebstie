Hmm... let&amp;#039;s take a look at NAB&amp;#039;s guidance over the last year:     Nov 2007 : &amp;amp;quot;NAB Group Chief Executive John Stewart said the bank had no direct exposure to distressed subprime loans&amp;amp;quot;.      July 2008 : &amp;amp;quot;NAB this morning said it had to set aside another $830 million for credit market losses, citing the rapid deterioration in US real estate markets. The provisions come on top of $181 million flagged in March, and go towards covering $1.2 billion in collateralised debt obligations (CDOs) backing American real estate assets&amp;amp;quot;.     Sept 2008 : &amp;amp;quot;NAB&amp;#039;s stock has been trading below its peers over concerns it will have to make additional write-downs on another portfolio of conduits comprising $4.5 billion worth of commercial mortgage backed securities and other loans.&amp;amp;quot;    Yes, nice guidance John.
