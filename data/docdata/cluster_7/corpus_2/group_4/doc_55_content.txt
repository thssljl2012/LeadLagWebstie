Not happy about this...(1) Will this extend to CBA/Colonial top ups as was looking to apply for a top-up just after 1 January 2009 (when have 1 year gst regsitration)?      (2) Are there any lenders who will lend lo doc to 80% lvr with abn of more than 2 years and gst registration of 1 year only without requiring BAS statements and accounts?      (3) This policy will have quite a negative impact on property prices as fewer self employed borrowers can tap their equity and fewer self employed applicants will be able to borrow over 60% of the purchase price of a property.
