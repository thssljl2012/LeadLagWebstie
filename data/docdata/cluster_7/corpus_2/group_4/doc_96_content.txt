If that is annualised it becomes worse than the UK.      House prices here are massively overpriced. I would not buy anytime in the next 3 years. Expect 30%+ falls in Brisbane Metro area                          The info from that report also says:          Quote:                          A drop in property prices in the three months to September was largely the result of high interest rates before the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) began its latest round of rate cuts, Australian Property Monitors (APM) senior economist Liam O&amp;#039;Hara...   APM predicts property prices to flatten or moderately fall in the next six months, providing further positive news for potential buyers.    http://news.theage.com.au/business/h...1111-5lty.html                           Annualised figures:          Quote:                          ANNUAL CHANGES (SEPTEMBER QUARTER 2007 TO SEPTEMBER QUARTER 2008)   Over the year to September quarter 2008, preliminary estimates show that the price index for  established houses  for the weighted average of the eight capital cities rose 2.8%.   Annually, house prices rose in Adelaide (+9.7%), Melbourne (+8.1%), Darwin (+6.4%), Brisbane (+5.6%), and Hobart (+2.4%), showed no change in Canberra (0.0%), and fell in Perth (-4.1%), and Sydney (-0.4%).    http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/MF/6416.0                           Price changes for established houses are different to new builds.      I have seen the prices of new builds drop, whilst established houses have risen.  My view is that the developers have been asking very high prices for new property, and they now have had to reduce their margins.      Established houses however, didn&amp;#039;t seem to rise as much, and haven&amp;#039;t fallen as much as the APM figures.
