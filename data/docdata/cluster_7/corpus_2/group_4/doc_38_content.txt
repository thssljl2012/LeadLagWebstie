I have some full docs with Westpac while the rest are low docs.  With CBA I have the wealth package which gives me a discounted rate of 7.04%.  NAB give me a similar rate to CBA while RAMS have got a great low doc rate for me of about 7.5%.      Most of my loans were refinanced from Macquarie over the last 4-5 months. If you want to refinance to low-docs with the major banks, you better get in soon as they making it more difficult for you.
