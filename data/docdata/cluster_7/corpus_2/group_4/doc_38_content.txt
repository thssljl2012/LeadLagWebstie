I read everything -&amp;amp;nbsp;file what&amp;#039;s important in my brain and throw the rest away. I personally&amp;amp;nbsp;found the comparisons of today&amp;amp;nbsp;to the depression by Anders at the Peterson Instiute to be interesting. It&amp;#039;s down the page under the heading of - &amp;amp;nbsp;  A Possible Gotterdammerung?   I don&amp;#039;t feel like deleting things out of anything that I post here....just because somebody might not like it. IMO that&amp;#039;s censorship that belongs in another country....hopefully not here.&amp;amp;nbsp;Take what you want and throw the rest away. There are parts I didn&amp;#039;t even bother to read myself...because I wasn&amp;#039;t interested or had already read it somewhere else.&amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;     http://baltimorechronicle.com/2008/110308Lendman.shtml     &amp;amp;nbsp;    ECONOMIC ANALYSIS:        More from the Front Lines of the Financial Crisis          by Stephen Lendman      Monday, 3 November 2008       What&amp;#039;s needed, but not proposed, is a 1930s type Home Owners&amp;#039; Loan Corporation (HOLC) plan that refinanced homes at affordable rates and prevented foreclosures. One on a grand scale as part of an enlightened New Deal agenda.      I n its latest economic outlook, Merrill Lynch economists &amp;quot;worry about inflation, or more precisely,&amp;quot; a lack of it. From crashing global equity markets, falling commodity prices, rising unemployment, stagnant wages, over-indebted households, declining production, the continuing housing crisis, and more. All pointing to several future quarters of negative growth. Showing that Fed chairman Bernanke will face &amp;quot;his greatest fear: deflation.&amp;quot; An analysis of the coincident to lagging indicators signals &amp;quot;deep recession.&amp;quot;   In his October 24, commentary, Merrill&amp;#039;s North American economist David Rosenberg sees &amp;quot;economic data deteriorating in a very serious way (and says) we are witnessing unprecedented stuff happen:&amp;quot;           the two-year housing recession &amp;quot;is still far from over&amp;quot; with new lows in a number of key readings;       it&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;morphed into a capex recession, industrial production&amp;quot; had its worst decline in 34 years;       consumer confidence showed record declines;       retail sales keep falling; evidence is that auto and chain store sales will show four straight down months; it&amp;#039;s happened only four other times since 1947, so &amp;quot;we&amp;#039;re living through a 1-in-200 event;&amp;quot;       based on CPI data, prices are falling; at a rapid pace also seen only four other times since 1947;       GDP will decline at 2% annual rate in Q 4; 4% in Q 1 2009 and 3.3% in Q 2.         Conclusion:  &amp;quot;This recession is unlike any seen in the last five decades.&amp;quot; Typically caused by inflation, inventory cycles or aggressive Fed tightening. &amp;quot;This is a balance sheet recession deeply rooted in asset liquidation and debt repayment, and would seem to have more in common with pre-WW I cycles.&amp;quot;    Going back to 1855, &amp;quot;a typical recession lasts 18 months.&amp;quot; It&amp;#039;s no assurance this one won&amp;#039;t be longer. Rosenberg thinks it started in January and believes will end &amp;quot;within a month of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) making the call.&amp;quot; It defines recession as &amp;quot;a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.&amp;quot; Some say that occurs when economic growth is negative for two or more consecutive quarters.    The signs are evident and growing, yet NBER is usually late making its call. It may hold off until housing shows signs of stabilizing. For some analysts, it&amp;#039;s the core economic problem, and as long as it keeps eroding no end of recession is in sight. The latest data aren&amp;#039;t encouraging:           Case-Shiller&amp;#039;s 10 and 20-city composite indexes set new record declines of 17.7% and 16.6% respectively; year-over-year dropping for 20 consecutive months; Case-Shiller predicts a peak to trough 28.6% drop in its 10-city composite index; it also sees up to 50% declines in some areas;       nominal house prices down 20% from their 2006 peak; according to the Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), this implies a 27% real decline; a loss of $5 trillion in housing wealth, and 60% of the bubble deflated so more is yet to come; at least another 10 - 15% to return to trend levels; another question is &amp;quot;whether markets will overshoot on the downside;&amp;quot; a very distinct possibility;       on October 29, CEPR reported record high ownership vacancies according to Census Bureau data at 2.8%; for rental units at 9.9%, slightly below the peak first quarter 10.1% level; CEPR predicts a fully deflated housing bubble by mid-2009 but added a caveat; &amp;quot;With the employment picture turning bleaker and the plunge in the stock market,&amp;quot; housing is certain to be even more negative in coming months; &amp;quot;the tens of millions of workers....fearful about their future job prospects will be very reluctant to buy a new home;&amp;quot; compounded by trillions of lost personal wealth (from home and stock market losses) will make households &amp;quot;much more cautious in all their expenditures;&amp;quot;       the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) index fell .6% in its latest July reading and is down 5.3% on a year-over-year basis; its sharpest decline ever;       Fitch expects home prices to fall another 10% in the next 18 months and will decline by an average 25% in real terms over the next five years; beginning from the second quarter 2008; they&amp;#039;re now back to early 2004 levels and heading lower;       the PMI Group predicts home price declines will double to a national average of 20% by next year with lower values in areas experiencing the sharpest increases;       economist Paul Krugman cites his &amp;quot;preferred metric;&amp;quot; the ratio of housing prices to rental rates; it shows the former got way overvalued; will retrace and result in about a 25% home valuation decline;       Goldman Sachs forecasts a 15% home price decline with no recession and 30% with one; and       The Economist sees &amp;quot;no end in sight....to America&amp;#039;s housing bust as prices continue to fall fast.&amp;quot;        On October 28, economist Nouriel Roubini was even more alarming on housing citing &amp;quot;The recessionary macro effect of the worst US housing bust ever.&amp;quot; He reported the view of a &amp;quot;senior professional in one of the (world&amp;#039;s) largest financial institutions&amp;quot; who emailed him &amp;quot;privately and confidentially.&amp;quot; As early as a year ago, he predicted &amp;quot;the worst housing recession in US history&amp;quot; and described &amp;quot;a bust process&amp;quot; in four phases:           &amp;quot;rising mortgage defaults, home prices start falling, sale volumes fall, housing starts and permits decline;&amp;quot; it&amp;#039;s been happening and we&amp;#039;re beginning phase two;       &amp;quot;home-builders&amp;#039; bankruptcies, housing starts and permits crash, substantial layoffs in construction and real estate-related fields (mortgage brokers, mortgage lenders, etc.);&amp;quot;       &amp;quot;substantial price declines in major metro areas, large rise in defaults of prime but low-equity mortgages;&amp;quot;       &amp;quot;large-scale government intervention to help households going bankrupt;&amp;quot; a political phenomenon so its timing and nature can&amp;#039;t be reliably forecast.        He cites clear phase two evidence already:           countless smaller builder and subcontractor bankruptcies;       Levitt Corp. home-building unit getting loan default notices;       national home builder Tousa with $1 billion in senior notes and subordinated debt hired law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld as a precaution in case of bankruptcy; and       Neumann Homes and Enterprise Construction file for bankruptcy.        Roubini agrees with his emailer &amp;quot;with one caveat.&amp;quot; He believes we&amp;#039;re past the beginning of phase two; most of its aspects have occurred, and we&amp;#039;re heading into phase three or close to it; he cites sharply falling home prices; rising defaults in prime and near prime mortgages; also some prime and near prime lenders in trouble; we&amp;#039;re also getting close to phase four as &amp;quot;over a dozen proposals to rescue 2 million plus households on the way to default and foreclosure are now being debated in Washington.&amp;quot; Debate is one thing. Meaningful action another and likely a ways off at best. Possibly once a new president is in office for something substantial if it comes at all.    Rubini&amp;#039;s emailer followed up with another. That consensus now &amp;quot;admits&amp;quot; what it denied last year. The reality of a severe housing downturn. In price action and foreclosures. The worst since the 1930s. But they&amp;#039;re still behind the curve by acknowledging &amp;quot;only minor macro effects.&amp;quot; He called it extraordinary that a decline this severe is being taken dismissively. &amp;quot;Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of this event is the refusal to recognize the possible dimensions, the impact of what is coming.&amp;quot; It&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;delusional&amp;quot; to believe that the &amp;quot;biggest housing recession in US history will not have severe macro effect. Most of the consensus (according to Bloomberg earlier)&amp;quot; was for 1.8% fourth quarter growth. It then predicted a Q 4 slow growth bottom with &amp;quot;economic growth recover(ing) in soft landing territory (2.5%).&amp;quot;    On what basis, he asks? &amp;quot;Mostly wishful thinking (because of) the economic and financial shocks leading to falling demand (and a worsening housing bust); anemic capex spending; slowdown in commercial real estate demand; sharp private consumption slowdown and weak supply (from weakening ISM - Institute of Supply Management;&amp;quot; fa...
