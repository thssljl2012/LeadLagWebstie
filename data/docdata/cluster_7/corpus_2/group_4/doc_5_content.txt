Sash,      I suspect fixed rates (say 5 years out) will not fall as strongly as variable rates.      This does create a very interesting situation for those of us who get it right when fixing rates.      Of course you could fix for 5 years somewhere in early-mid 2009 only to find RBA rates  approach 0% in 2010 and you end up paying a substantial penalty to break the loan when you sell up (as tenants are no longer paying the rent).      Reading the Fin Review today there were many negative articles...analyst price target for  General Motors in US at $0 sometime next year, Australian banks looking to raise capital (including possibly CBA), Asciano 60% price fall yesterday, Babcock &amp;amp;amp; Brown trading around 60c, the whole ABC Learning debacle, NSW state government cutting spending (and increasing taxes on certain sectors of the economy) at exactly the wrong time, Qld state govt now considering similar budget cuts, AIG insurance in sell-off, &amp;amp;quot;Joy at China (stimulus) package reverts to gloom&amp;amp;quot; , &amp;amp;quot;Centro exposure is making CBA sweat&amp;amp;quot; etc
