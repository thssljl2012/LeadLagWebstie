 The CBA will be downbeat until that huge white elephant in the room - Centro Properties is resolved. Looking at the price of CNP and CER, any hope for them seems to be fading fast.      If Centro fails it will be Australia&amp;#039;s largest corporate collapse, and CBA is exposed. The expiry of the funding deadline is December 15th, which is looming ever closer.     Under that scenario, a target of $15 (or at least much lower than current prices) couldn&amp;#039;t be ruled out.
