                                         Quote:                          Originally Posted by  dhukka                         I see the 2ks on the XAO, CBA trading in the 20&amp;#039;s and BHP in the teens as very conceivable. Consider that P/E ratios become very depressed at the end of bear markets. At the end of the 1966 -1982 bear market the P/E of the market was around 6 - 7 times trailing earnings. So if you think CBA is cheap trading at 11 times earnings just remember that history suggests it can get a whole lot cheaper.       The above is not a forecast, I don&amp;#039;t expect the XAO will see the 2k&amp;#039;s but I wouldn&amp;#039;t be surprised. FWIW I&amp;#039;m looking for a bottoming somewhere between 3400 - 3800.                                             Noone would have accused me of being an optimist over the last 18 months but it turns out I was. When I made this forecast in March it looked dire to most. I&amp;#039;m not surprised that we have gone lower than 3400 it has been the speed of the decline that has been surprising. The US recession is just getting warmed up and I think  analysts are still far too optimistic on earnings . I can see the XAO falling to the  2700 - 2800  area quite easily but of course it won&amp;#039;t be straight down move. We are due for a decent rally soon.
