          Well this month could be interesting.   Some signs of POO stabilising, increased M&amp;amp;amp;A or financing solutions and lots of news flow across the sector.    FWIW it seems to me that there is a significant City reappraisal going on of the merits of the E&amp;amp;amp;P sector, partly with an eye to the above factors. All the totems of the traditional &amp;amp;quot;safe&amp;amp;quot; sectors elsewhere seem to be falling one by one.....BT down 25% this morning, Barclays up early doors after its Middle East fund raising - but now down 11% when people have seen the terms.  Meanwhile the E&amp;amp;amp;P sector seems to have plenty of M&amp;amp;amp;A interest at some very fancy premiums to current market prices, as well as some extremely cheap valuations relative to current fundamentals (let alone expected fundamentals, based on oil price expectations for 6 months or so out [eg Barclays and others looking for a recovery to $90, in line with long-term production costs for new deep projects etc].......   ....but stock-picking is a bit of a lottery under these conditions.  ee
