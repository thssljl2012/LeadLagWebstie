SYDNEY, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Activity in Australia&amp;#039;s service sector contracted for a seventh straight month in October as chaos in financial markets rocked the confidence of consumers and businesses, a survey showed on Wednesday.    The Australian Industry Group (AiG)-Commonwealth Bank Performance of Services Index (PSI) fell 2.8 points to 42.1 in October, well below the 50 line marking the threshold between expansion and contraction.    Sales and supplier deliveries both declined at a faster pace, while employment fell for a fifth consecutive month. Worryingly, the index of new orders sank 5.8 points to a near record low of 38.7, pointing to further weakness ahead.    &amp;#039;Order books were poor right across the services sector,&amp;#039; said Heather Ridout, chief executive of AiG. &amp;#039;New orders were particularly weak in the retail trade sector with businesses battening down for a potentially tough Christmas.    Of the nine sectors covered, only communications showed any growth, while conditions were particularly tough in accommodation and cafes and in property services.    &amp;#039;The ongoing weakness in services sector activity is one of a number of indicators which help explain why the Reserve Bank has moved aggressively to cut rates,&amp;#039; said John Peters, a senior economist at CBA.    The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) slashed its key cash rate by 1 percentage point in October, the biggest cut in 16 years, and eased by a further 75 basis points to 5.25 percent at its meeting this week.    &amp;#039;The data also helps signpost further RBA easing in the coming months,&amp;#039; said Peters. &amp;#039;The RBA is concerned about the collateral damage hitting the economy from the US credit crisis induced global slowdown.&amp;#039;    The survey&amp;#039;s measure of sales slipped 2.2 points in October to 40.0, while the index of employment eased 0.1 point to 46.9.
