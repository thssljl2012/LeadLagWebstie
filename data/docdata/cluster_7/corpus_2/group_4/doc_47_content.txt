Spoke to my MB this morning who is ex-Bank.      I asked about locking in rates; his opinion is not yet; middle of next year approx - maybe a little earlier, as there is reasonable expectation of the rates dropping until well into next year.        I&amp;#039;ll be locking in for as long as poss when that time comes - around March, April?
