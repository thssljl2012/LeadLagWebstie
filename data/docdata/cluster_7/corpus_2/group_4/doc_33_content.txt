         So am I the only one positive now? :o)  I just wanted to post and point out that I&amp;#039;m still continueing with my strategy of dripping money into various banks and will be continueing to do this over the coming 12-18mths. As ever we&amp;#039;ll see how this pans out in 2yrs time. I still feel that substantial gains will be made.  Fwiw CDS spreads continue to grind lower and LIBOR rates are falling pretty dramatically. HBOS CDS peaked at +500bps on the 16th September, today it fell to just 0.95% in 5yrs and 0.93% in 10yrs. It&amp;#039;s likely to head even lower in coming weeks.   HBOS, Barclays and RBS have all now successfully issued under the governments AAA rated bond scheme. It&amp;#039;s likely that if things carry on they&amp;#039;ll be able to simply abandon it next year and start issueing again themselves. With rates now set to fall dramatically and the banks borrowing costs also falling margins are going to start widening rapidly IMO.  B
