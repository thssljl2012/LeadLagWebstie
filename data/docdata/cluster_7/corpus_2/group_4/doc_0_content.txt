I have the FY09 forecast yield at around  8.6%  according to comsec consensus estimates (assuming a price of $31) but I&amp;#039;d be careful about the yield, CBA announced what amounted to a profit warning last week in their September quarter trading update. Short term it looks oversold, especially when it dipped below $30 earlier this morning.
