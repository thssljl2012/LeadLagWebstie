SYDNEY, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Cromwell Group, an    Australian property firm and fund manager, is in talks with    investors over buying back its commercial mortgage-backed    securities (CMBS) issue using the proceeds of a new A$452 million    ($291 million) loan, the company said on Thursday.    Preliminary pricing of the CMBS buyback is expected to be    released in a week, with deal completion to follow quickly,    Cromwell said.    The company did not give details on how much of the A$429    million CMBS offer, initially issued in 2006, it would buy back.    Investors that choose to keep the notes on issue will be    repaid on the initial scheduled maturity of April 2009, it said.    The bond buyback, arranged by Westpac Institutional Bank,    will be financed with the proceeds of the syndicated loan that    was drawn down this week.    The loan was provided by Commonwealth Bank of Australia,    National Australia Bank and Westpac Banking Corp.    &amp;#039;The market is looking for certainty regarding long-term debt    arrangements ... Our debt position gives the group a secure base    from which to grow,&amp;#039; said Cromwell&amp;#039;s treasurer, David Gippel, in    a statement.
