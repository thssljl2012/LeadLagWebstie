 ECB rate now 3.25%.  For this first time ever, the BOE rate is less than ECB.     I dont believe that our BOE panel made that decision without political interference from Gordon and Darling.     What irritated me about the emergency cut last month was how Gordon announced it himself in parliament taking all the kudos for it.     What will happen to savings rates? Well some cant be cut by 1.5% as they are less than than now, so they will go down to 0.1 or 0.05%.     Then when eventually rates go up again, new accounts will be offered and the rates on the old accounts will never rise.     I used to get 3% in Barclays current years ago, then it dropped to 0.01% for years, now its been abolished. Very quietly, I just noticed I was getting no interest any more.     The usual suspects will never stop calling for cuts til the base rate is 0%.   There is somethiing called the liquidity trap where if you cut rates below a certain level which I would say is 4% in the UK then it has no positive effect at all. This is what happened in Japan.
