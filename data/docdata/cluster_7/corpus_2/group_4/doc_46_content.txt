          Barclays, Alliance &amp;amp;amp; Leicester and HSBC came under growing pressure last night to fall in line with other  mortgage lenders  and cut their key rates.    Well that is a surprise. Anyone still think Barclays should have taken the govt money because it was cheaper? No strings my arse.   http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sect...
