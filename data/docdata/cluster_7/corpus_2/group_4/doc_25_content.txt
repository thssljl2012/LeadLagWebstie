Everyone`s probably read this from another thread;      Ric Battellino, the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said today that the economy is set to avoid a recession and an &amp;#039;&amp;#039;inflation overhang&amp;#039;&amp;#039; may limit the central bank&amp;#039;s scope to trim borrowing costs. The RBA has &amp;#039;&amp;#039;a big task ahead to bring inflation down and this could limit room for maneuvering on monetary policy,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Battellino said today in Sydney.
