  They are probably refering to thier SVR or to new tracker products, on which the current habit is to increase the margin when base rate gets cut. Existing customers get the full benefit of the rate cut.     Unsure if they have a lower limit / &amp;amp;quot;collar&amp;amp;quot; on thier trackers like Halifax do...I will find out.
