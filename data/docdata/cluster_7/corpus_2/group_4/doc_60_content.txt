Our $38 price target is based on a 12-month distribution run rate of $3.04 (previously $2.97) and a target yield of 8%.                                   &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56451;     MMP&amp;#039;s 3Q results with were in line with our estimates. Overall EBITDA increased 20% YoY to $105 MM, as pipeline, terminals and ammonia segments posted improved YoY results. In our view, MMP posted solid results given headwinds of lower refined products demand and Hurricanes Ike and Gustav.                                   &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56451;     Quarterly distribution up 9.1% YoY and 2.2% sequentially to $0.7025 per unit ($2.81 annualized). Our 3-year distribution CAGR estimate is 8.25%.                                   &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56451;     In our opinion, MMP is a relatively low-risk refined product pipeline MLP with solid growth and a strong balance sheet. At current levels, however, we believe the valuation is less compelling due to the recent rally. Since 10/10, MMP shares have increased 61%, vs. MLP Index up 37% and S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 up 8%. With MMP trading at a premium, 7.9% vs peer average 9.9% yield, we recommend waiting for a more attractive entry point.
