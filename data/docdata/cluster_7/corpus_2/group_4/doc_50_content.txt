Just received this from the &amp;amp;quot;Reno Kings&amp;amp;quot;, anyone have any comments on this ?      Seems the strategy to captilise interest is all but disapearing (for now anyway)         =========================   Time Running Out for Low Doc Investors      In less than a fortnight, many low doc investors wanting to refinance an investment property will strike a major hurdle.      The chances are they will not be able to do it.      Australias leading mortgage insurer, Genworth Financial, has announced that from December 1 it will no longer insure low doc investment loans which are being refinanced.      That means banks who use Genworth to insure low doc loans wont be able to lend more than 60% of the value of the property.      Neither will Genworth insure low doc loans which involve equity release, cash out or debt consolidation.      Genworth will also require low doc borrowers to have an active ABN for at least two years and provide 12 months BAS statements from the Tax Office.      Commonwealth Bank has already indicated it will follow Genworths policy.        Other lenders who use Genworth to insure low doc loans are expected to issue similar policy statements soon.      So, if you are planning a low doc refinance of your investment property you have until one minute to midnight on November 30th to lodge an application, according to a CBA release.      The other big mortgage insurer, PMI, has already refused mortgage insurance for investors taking cash out of a property. Dont be surprised if PMI now follows Genworths harder line.      If you have been delaying refinancing an investment property, dont delay any longer. You should act now. Next month, the opportunity will have passed you by.   =====================================
