Building approvals fell 5.4% to 10,730 in October, seasonally adjusted, from an upwardly revised 11,339 units in September, the Australian Bureau of Statistics says.      The market forecast was for building approvals to have recorded a rise of 0.7% in October.      St George Bank chief economist Besa Deda said October saw both rate cuts and the Federal Government&amp;#039;s $10.4 billion stimulus package aimed in part at prospective home buyers.      &amp;amp;quot;But what dominated that month has been the intensification of the credit crisis and  the ensuring caution among households,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; she said.                      Just a few minor points you seemed to have missed, just a few;      1. The Package was only announced on the 14th of October; kinda right in the middle of the month in which you point at the drop in home activity;      2. Just another minor point, but maybe the reason it was announced in october was due to these very figures that you have just posted; i.e. maybe the government realised that their was a fall in activity and announced the package in response to this?
