SYDNEY, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Australia's consumers expect inflation to fall sharply in the coming year, a survey showed on Thursday, suggesting plenty of scope for further cuts in interest rates to support the ailing economy.    The Melbourne Institute said its December survey found respondents expected consumer price inflation to slow to an annual 2.5 percent over the next 12 months, down from 3.3 percent in October. That was the lowest reading since March 2005 and a long way from July's peak of 5.9 percent.    It would also take inflation back within the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) 2 to 3 percent target band, a major swing given the CPI grew at an annual 5 percent last quarter.    That should be a comfort to the central bank which has slashed interest rates by 3 percentage points in recent months.
