President Hu Jintao marked the anniversary with a speech in the Great Hall of the People.      On December 18, 1978, during the third plenary session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the party elite ratified emerging leader Deng Xiaoping's decision to open the economy, a decision that would shape the future, not only of China but also Australia.       At the time China was still recovering from the disastrous decade-long Cultural Revolution and the long period of political and economic turmoil under Mao Zedong.       The forward-thinking Deng began by giving the southern cities of China special economic zones that became the economic powerhouses of the country and factories to the Western world. The shift paved the way for China to become one of the world's economic superpowers, as well as helping Australia's economic prosperity by providing the biggest single market for many of our commodities. It also began a cheap supply of manufactured goods to the world that has been a significant force in holding down inflation levels in the West, underwriting an unusually long period of prosperity.       Australia, which recognised China in 1972 and lost the ideological baggage that drives some protectionist-minded forces in other countries such as the US, has sought to promote ties between the two countries and has ridden China's economic boom.       China is Australia's key partner in terms of two-way trade and its economic growth, until recently, has helped cushion the blow of the global financial crisis.       According to data from the International Monetary Fund, the Chinese economy has risen from the world's 10th largest in 1990 to fourth in 2006, and is expected to rise to third this year, just behind the US and Japan.       Hu noted this week that the Chinese economy had grown at an estimated 9.8 per cent a year every year since 1978, three times the world average.       But as it celebrates the benefits of its opening up, China is facing one of the most uncertain periods of its recent history.       Looking back at 2008, China's 30-year economic high-water mark probably came with the Olympic Games in August. While the games were another milestone in China's membership of the world community, it was followed by a sharp downturn in industrial production as the apparently impervious Middle Kingdom succumbed to the infections from the financial crisis.       Those who had been proudly proclaiming that the Chinese economy was decoupled from the rest of the world because of its strong internal growth engine were soon silenced.       Southern China, which led the way in China's opening, has been the area hardest hit economically as factories that once pumped out cheap toys, clothing and electronic goods are closed -- many permanently -- prompting angry protests from unemployed factory workers. This week it emerged that as many as nine million unemployed migrant workers from China's once prosperous southern and eastern coastal cities have gone back to the countryside.       China's growth rate, which was running at 12 per cent earlier this year, has already fallen below the 9.8 per cent average highlighted by Hu this week. The last official economic growth rate, for the September quarter, was down to 9 per cent with expectations that the December quarter figure could be as low as 5per cent.       There is mounting concern about stability problems as a generation of Chinese workers, who have enjoyed decades of rising prosperity, face joblessness and economic dislocation.       Hu makes it clear that he plans to continue China's open-door economic policy.       &amp;quot;Reform and opening was a key choice for the fate of China,&amp;quot; he said this week. &amp;quot;The road has been correctly chosen. There is no way we will turn back.&amp;quot;       While China is no longer quite the flavour of the month, Australia has an even greater stake in the ability of Chinese leaders to manage their country through its shaky economic times. As Australian workers in the mining industry face lay-offs because of the sharp fall in demand for commodities (the West Australian Government this week slashed its economic growth forecasts for 2010 from 6.25 per cent to only 1.5 per cent for the state), those looking for signs of the depth of the world economic recession should watch developments in China even more closely.       Hu is using the revenues generated by 30 years of prosperity to undertake China's largest government stimulus package, with about $800 billion in spending initiatives from high-speed rail projects to more investment in roads, airports and ports, and boosts to the country's power grid.       The Government has cut interest rates and is encouraging measures to turn around the country's housing industry.       The vast fiscal stimulus package equates to about 15 per cent of China's economy.       While the focus in the developed world is on whether US president-elect Barack Obama can provide the necessary economic and psychological circuit-breaker for the world economic crisis, Australia's prosperity may be more closely aligned with the success of Hu's economic turnaround package. Hu knows the country's prosperity in the short term will not come from the export-driven growth of the past but from stimulating domestic demand.       In a recent speech to the annual dinner of the Australian Business Economists, Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens observed: &amp;quot;The fortunes of the Chinese economy are increasingly important, particularly for Australia and other countries in our time zone.       &amp;quot;The most striking real economic fact of the past several months is not continued US economic weakness but that China's economy has slowed much more quickly than anyone had forecast.&amp;quot;       As Australia and rest of the world suffer from the follies of the over-paid, under-supervised financial wizards of the West, the success of Hu's difficult balancing act will be the real determinant of the severity of the downturn ahead of Australia and whether there is any grounds for optimism for a happier Christmas in 2009.
