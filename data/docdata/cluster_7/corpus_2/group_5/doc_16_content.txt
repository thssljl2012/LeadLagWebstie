rumple - a great Christmas to you too!  I dont have a target, and just watch the chart. The SP has been consolidating since the mid Nov drop to 108p intraday, and the 10 day EMA is still under the 26 day EMA, so little to inspire confidence. I still remain bearish, and just wait for any indication of a rally.  I copied this from Edmund Conway's piece in the Telegraph (he is economics editor), as it suggests caution is still the best option:    &amp;quot;A number of economists, including those at Capital Economics and Bank of America, believe that 2009 will see the worst year for the economy since at least 1947, when Britain was still recovering from the Second World War. That year, the UK was hit by one of the coldest winters on record, combined with fuel shortages and a fiscal crisis as the US threatened to pull back from their post-war loans.     Bank of America's Matthew Sharratt said: &amp;quot;The ongoing global financial market turmoil, the correction in the domestic housing market, historically weak household disposable income growth from recent surges in energy costs, and now rising unemployment will extract a heavy toll on the economy, in our view.&amp;quot; END    Not exactly cheery is it? I wish it wasnt that way, but there is no point trying to fight the Tsunami of gloom that is gripping the market, and likely to continue into the New Year. No 1 action for me is capital preservation, which in the face of such market uncertainty seems the best approach, whilst always watching the chart. AR
