The fed tends to lower rates to pump up an economy, and raise rates to keep one in check. It's their most powerful tool in trying to control economic trends.  If there wasn't any credit available, lowering rates wouldn't change that. Remember, lower rates mean less of a return for the lender.  A lender makes more money on an 8% mortgage, than it does at 4%.
