The euro    has fallen broadly on increased chances of rate cuts in the euro    zone. The European Central Bank meets next week to decide on    rates.    * Oil prices were steady above $48 a barrel, but gold  prices slipped. A jump in oil prices had led a 1.46    percent rise in the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index on Monday    and shored up sentiment for commodity-linked currencies.    * Australian bond futures were mixed with the longer end    falling as safe-haven inflows eased. Bill futures were    lower with investors repricing chances of a rate cut in Australia    before the scheduled board meeting in early February. The central    bank monetary policy board does not meet in January.    * Three-year futures added 0.015 points to 96.46    points, while the 10-year bond futures contract fell 0.01    points to 95.725. It struck a record high of 96.040 on Friday.
