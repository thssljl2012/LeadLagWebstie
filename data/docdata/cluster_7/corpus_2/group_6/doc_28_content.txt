Umm Col &amp; Jimmy, weren't you guys quoting NAB also?  Keep telling you, its all about momentum.       http://business.theage.com.au/busine...0127-7qmx.html             Quote:                         weaker economy, more industry bailouts and a huge stimulus spend are likely to push the Federal budget into a $40 billion deficit next financial year, the National Australia Bank says                     .              Quote:                         NAB predicts a $10 billion Federal budget deficit for the current 2008-09 financial year.                          Quote:                         Meanwhile, NAB lowered its gross domestic product growth forecast for 2009 to minus-0.25% from a previously expected 0.5% gain. It dropped its forecast for 2010 to a 1% increase from an earlier prediction of 1.75%.      Weaker growth means a higher jobless rate, costing the Government more money in unemployment benefits.      Unemployment is expected to  rise as high as 9% in 2010  from its current level of 4.5%, as companies with slumping business levels shed jobs.
