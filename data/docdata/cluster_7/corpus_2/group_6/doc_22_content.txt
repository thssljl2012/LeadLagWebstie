LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Interbank lending rates for three-month dollar and sterling funds were indicated slightly higher on Monday and euro rates marginally lower amid a renewed wave of banking sector writedowns, losses and government aid.    The UK Treasury announced a range of measures on Monday to help kickstart bank lending and the Royal Bank of Scotland reported losses of more than 20 billion pounds last year.    Three-month dollar deposit rates were indicated between 1.01 and 1.30 percent compared with a 1.03-1.20 percent range early on Friday and three-month sterling deposit rates  were between 1.85 and 2.07 percent versus 1.30-2.08 percent.    Three-month euro deposit rates were indicated between 2.10 and 2.43 percent compared with 2.22 and 2.45 percent early on Friday, Reuters charts showed.    The latest developments surrounding UK banks comes after Barclays shares lost 45 percent of their value last week and U.S. banking giants Bank of America and Citigroup announced large fourth quarter losses.    Interbank deposit rates are only indicative prices of where banks are lending to each other, which institutions use as a base to set their own lending rates.
