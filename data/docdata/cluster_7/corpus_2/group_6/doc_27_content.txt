 Nobody "follows" anybody in housing markets, economies follow global events.. housing can be attached to that.     The doesn't put such a good picture on the "safe" Victoria story, despite the regular denial "it's only a resource problem in QLD and WA"...     http://www.theage.com.au/national/ec...0117-7jm4.html                                             Quote:                    National Australia Bank chief economist  Alan Oster said the State Government's predictions for the economy were far too upbeat, calling it "stupid" for standing by its promise to deliver a surplus equivalent to at least 1 per cent of the state economy.    "In a recession, that's stupid and I'm willing to say that's stupid," Mr Oster said.    "We have unemployment going to 6 per cent at the end of this year and 7 per cent by the end of next.    "To be brutally honest, my question when I look at my (unemployment) forecast is, 'Am I too low?', because the data that's been coming out over the past couple of months from the US, Europe and Japan is just terrible."                                             Anybody who also "loaded up" into the shock market in 2001/02 (but instead were too scared and went into property) would have also made double digit returns for many years also. In fact it was the exactly the same economic vehicle/conditions that drove the housing market to where it was... strange that.
