I was in a St George bank meeting yesterday and the finance lady said that they have an announcement coming out on Tuesday re 5.38% variable rate, not sure which product but makes me wonder whether my CBA reduction was a glitch after all, maybe a few banks are after kudos again by getting in before the RBA meeting.
