The dramatic collapse of the housing market - which is predicted to suffer a crash in prices of up to 20% this year - will blow an unexpected 15bn &amp;quot;black hole&amp;quot; in the public finances, economists have warned.  the Treasury estimated that property prices would &amp;quot;fall by 20% in the two years to the end of 2009&amp;quot;. The PBR predicted that, as a result, 7bn would be lost to the Treasury in 2009-10, compared with figures in the 2008 budget.  But after house prices crashed 18.9% last year alone, according to the Halifax - and amid predictions of an even sharper drop this year - the loss of revenue in 2009-10 is expected to at least double to nearer 15bn. Michael Saunders, chief economist at Citibank, said that he expected prices to fall by a further 15% to 20% this year alone.  Seema Shah, an economist at Capital Economics, said: &amp;quot;We are expecting things to be even worse.&amp;quot;  Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats' treasury spokesman said that the government had not only failed to see the crash coming, but had got into a &amp;quot;foolish bidding war&amp;quot; with the Tories over inheritance tax &amp;quot;which will now leave the Treasury with far less in tax than they should have had&amp;quot;.
