The Westpac/Melbourne Institute[/url] index of economic activity, which indicates the likely pace of growth three to nine months into the future, was 0.6 per cent in October, down from 1.1 per cent in September.   Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said the slowdown in the growth rate of the leading index continued in October, although it was not as abrupt as the fall in September to 1.1 per cent from four per cent in August.   &amp;quot;The value of the leading index now will be to provide a guide as to whether Australia is likely to experience a recession in 2009,&amp;quot; Mr Evans said.   &amp;quot;It is likely that growth in 2009 will, at best, show little improvement on the anaemic 1.6 per cent we expect through 2008.&amp;quot;   said the dynamics of the Australian economy were likely to be determined by how businesses reacts to the current economic crisis and the impact of jobs from the financial crunch.   The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut of 300 basis points off the cash rate since September and the federal government's $10.4 billion package should provide substantial stimulus to the economy, Mr Evans said.   &amp;quot;In particular we have seen aggressive easing by the monetary authorities and unlike other developed economies, monetary policy is having a significant effect on reducing interest rates for the private sector,&amp;quot; he said.   &amp;quot;Those actions along with a likely fiscal easing of around two per cent of gross domestic product are supporting household disposable income and providing an important offset to the negative wealth and confidence effects of the global financial crisis.   &amp;quot;However, Westpac's research indicates that households are very nervous about job security and are therefore likely to save a substantial proportion of this income boost.&amp;quot;   The Australian economy will remain buoyant, just, in subdued conditions, Mr Evans said.   &amp;quot;At this stage the leading index is not indicating a recession and Westpac's forecasts are for a year of weak but nevertheless positive growth,&amp;quot; Mr Evans said.   &amp;quot;We confidently expect substantially more stimulus from the Australian authorities.   &amp;quot;However, in the near term, we cannot envisage unexpectedly positive developments in global economic conditions that might allay the concerns of business and financial institutions.&amp;quot;   Mr Evans expects the central bank to cut rates more in 2009, starting with a 50 basis point cut on February 3, in a bid to stimulate the flagging domestic economy.   &amp;quot;The most important issue is how low rates will eventually go.   &amp;quot;We expect that the RBA's cash rate will bottom out at around 2.75 per cent by the June quarter,&amp;quot; Mr Evans said.
