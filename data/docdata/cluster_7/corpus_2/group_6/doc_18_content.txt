HONG KONG, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures extended gains in Asia on Friday while safe-haven Treasuries slid after the U.S. government pumped $20 billion into Bank of America , the latest intervention to prop up the battered financial sector.    March S&amp;P 500 futures were up 8.5 points, or 1 percent, at 847.80. Ten-year U.S. Treasuries fell 20/32 in price to yield 2.270 percent, up 7 basis points from late U.S. trade.    The dollar showed little reaction to the news.    Higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar held hefty gains against the yen.
