By Mantik Kusjanto and Adrian Bathgate    WELLINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - Standard &amp;amp; Poor's warned on Tuesday it could downgrade New Zealand's foreign currency rating, threatening to accelerate capital flight from an economy sinking deeper into recession and struggling to fund its current account deficit.    The New Zealand dollar, which had surged as investors moved to profit from a high credit rating and interest rates, sank 5 percent to a 4-week low on fears a downgrade would extend a selloff already fuelled by rate cuts and global risk aversion.    The diminishing allure of New Zealand assets raised questions about how the country would finance its current account deficit, after the global financial crisis pushed much of the industrialised world into recession.    'The kiwi in particular is very vulnerable given its reliance on external funding to finance that current account deficit,' said Sue Trinh senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.    'Financing of the current account deficit in recent quarters has been largely dependant on hot money flows which turns on a dime,' she warned and said the currency would fall to 43 cents by the middle of 2010, more than a fifth below current levels.    New Zealand's high credit rating and central bank interest rates above 8 percent drove the New Zealand dollar early last year to its highest level against the U.S. dollar since it was freely floated more than two decades ago.    But a contraction in the economy in each of the first three quarters of 2008 and cuts in interest rates to a five-year low of 5 percent since the global financial crisis blew up has knocked the allure of New Zealand assets.    A ratings downgrade would be a further blow.    Standard &amp;amp; Poor's Ratings Services confirmed New Zealand's foreign currency and local currency ratings at AA-plus and AAA, respectively, the two highest ratings.    But it cut the foreign currency rating outlook to negative from stable, while retaining a stable outlook for the local currency rating.    It blamed the cut on the outlook for the country's widening external imbalances, highlighted by a current account deficit equal to 8 percent of gross domestic product.    S&amp;amp;P said the country's net financial-sector external debt doubled to about 200 percent of current account receipts in the five years to fiscal 2008. It forecasts the ratio would rise to 225 percent in 2009.    'Such a high level of external debt may, in our view, lead to a rise in funding rates for private-sector borrowers, depressing investment and deepening the country's economic downturn,' S&amp;amp;P said.    'The negative outlook on the foreign currency rating reflects the likelihood of a rating downgrade if external imbalances begin to pressure the country's investment, growth and fiscal performance,' S&amp;amp;P sovereign analyst Kyran Curry said in a statement.    The New Zealand dollar dropped as low as $0.5569 after the S&amp;amp;P announcement, down more than 5 percent from Monday's late trading levels in the domestic market.    The yield on 6-month government bonds fell as much as 20 basis points as the market factored in more rate cuts to try to lift the sluggish economy.    A business confidence survey showing sentiment had slumped in the fourth quarter of 2008 to match a 33-year low struck in the first half of 2008 suggested the recession would extend into the final period of the year.    'We are going deeper into recession, we're not emerging from recession, therefore New Zealand's cash rate has to go a lot lower,' said Deutsche Bank chief economist Darren Gibbs.    Underlining the waning investor interest, Westpac Bank expects a sizeable outflow of funds in coming months, noting around NZ$3.3 billion (US$1.83 billion) in New Zealand dollar eurobonds are due to mature in January and February with no new issues yet announced to replace them.    The central bank has cut rates four times since July by a total of 3.25 percentage points to 5 percent to support the economy. It has said further cuts are likely and most analysts see rates falling to 3.5 percent by the middle of this year.    The government has forecast a swing to a deep fiscal deficit in coming years as it spends to support the economy.    But S&amp;amp;P said the forecast for the fiscal deficit to widen to 5.6 percent of GDP by 2011 from 3.7 percent in 2009 could undermine investment confidence unless the government showed how it would bring the fiscal expansion under control.    Finance Minister Bill English said he was committed to fiscal consolidation and S&amp;amp;P said it was awaiting the next budget to see the government's financial plans.    'A credible medium-term fiscal plan combined with an easing of New Zealand's external imbalances could result in the ratings stabilising at the existing levels. Absent such developments, the foreign currency rating could be lowered,' S&amp;amp;P said.
