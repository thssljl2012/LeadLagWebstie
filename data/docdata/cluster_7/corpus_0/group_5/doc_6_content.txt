By Larry Swing Overnight Global News    The European DJ Stoxx 50 this morning is trading -1.71% lower and S&amp;Ps are down -2.40 points (-0.28%) as the markets brace for today's US unemployment report which is expected to suggest a steep decline in the US labor market and economy in November. Goldman Sachs today issued a report telling investors to "remain defensive" since the start of 2009 "is unlikely to bring a change in the dynamic of growth." Goldman downgraded the personal and household goods sector to "underweight" from "neutral" due to weaker consumer demand. Companies that benefit from US-China trade (e.g., Alcoa and Caterpillar) rose today after news late yesterday that the US and China agreed to provide $20 billion to finance and promote trade between the two nations, which is a positive signal to markets that US and China will resist the temptation to resort to protectionism during this period of global economic weakness. Oil companies are generally higher today on today's 67-cent rally in crude oil prices. Asia-Pacific stocks today closed mixed: Japan -0.08%, Hong Kong +2.49%, China +1.53%, Taiwan -0.70%, Australia -1.20%, Singapore +0.94%, South Korea +2.21%, Bombay -2.87%.   US Unemployment report - The market is expecting a very weak Nov unemployment report today that indicates sharp job losses and a negative outlook for consumer spending and confidence. Nov payrolls are expected to show a sharp decline of 325,000, adding to October's decline of 240,000. US payrolls have fallen every month this year. If Nov payrolls show the expected decline today of 325,000, then the total year-to-date job loss for 2008 will be 1.5 million jobs.   The job situation in the US manufacturing sector is also expected to be severe with manufacturers cutting back on production and employee head counts to account for sharply lower demand tied to lower domestic and export demand. Nov manufacturing payrolls are expected to fall sharply by 100,000 jobs, adding to the 90,000 decline seen in October. US manufacturing payroll jobs have declined for 28 consecutive months by a total of 920,000 jobs. The expected decline in today's report of 100,000 would bring the total job loss in the manufacturing sector to more than 1 million over the past 2-1/3 years.    The hollowing out of the US manufacturing sector preceded the current recession but the current economic crisis is accelerating the process of slashing the size of the US manufacturing sector. Most of those manufacturing jobs will never come back in the US as lower-cost labor from overseas takes over those jobs. The decline in manufacturing jobs is particularly damaging to the US economy since manufacturing jobs tend to pay more than service sector jobs, meaning that the loss of manufacturing jobs causes a larger hit to US personal income and spending.   Todays Nov unemployment rate is expected to rise +0.3 points to 6.8%, thus posting a new 15-year high. The US unemployment rate has already exceeded the peak of 6.3% seen in the last recession (2002-03) and is now headed toward the previous business cycle peak of 7.8% in seen 1992. The post-war record high for the US unemployment rate is 10.8% posted in 1982. The US unemployment situation is likely to worsen at least through mid-2009. The labor market lags the business cycle and the labor market is therefore likely to continue to weaken even after the US economy hits bottom. That means that a peak US unemployment of at least 9% could occur in the current cycle.
