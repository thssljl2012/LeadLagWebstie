         The markets were surprised today when the Reserve Bank of Australia decided to leave short-term interest rates on hold at 3.25% (historically low for Australia, but very high compared to most other countries). But that decision should have come as no surprise given the facts I laid out last week about the Australian economy. It is doing quite well, so further interest rate cuts could hardly be justified. Indeed, the RBA arguably went too far in its previous cuts.Still, given the aggressive interest rate cutting tone of previous meetings, it was understandable that some expected further cuts. So maybe the RBA read this blog and was convinced by the facts I presented! Or maybe not, but in any case they have most likely read the same facts that I presented and by that been persuaded to leave rates on hold. As RBA Governor Glenn Stevens puts it:"The Australian economy has not experienced the sort of large contraction seen elsewhere"It remains to be seen whether or not that will be true in the future as well. If it does, then the future rate cuts the markets have priced in won't materialize, which means that the Aussie dollar will recover. If on the other hand Australia falls into a recession and the RBA resumes its interest rate cuts, the Aussie dollar won't recover anytime soon and could even fall further.
