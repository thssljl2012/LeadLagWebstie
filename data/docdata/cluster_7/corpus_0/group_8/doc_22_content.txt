The good news, of a sort, for the two-thirds of Australian households that are owner-occupiers is that average house prices have dropped less than in other countries. Here, the average for house prices fell by 3.3per cent last year. In the US, average house prices across 20 main cities have declined by about 19 per cent during the past year, while in Britain, Spain, New Zealand and Ireland the slump averaged about 10 per cent.Our milder decline reflects, in part, the increases in interest rates announced by the Reserve Bank of Australia from mid-2002 that dampened the boom in house prices in some regions, notably Sydney.
