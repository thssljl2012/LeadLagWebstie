            Yesterday, I attend the Economist Intelligence Unit event "Global Outlook 2009: What lies ahead for the global economy." Below are a few notes based on diligent typing by my colleague Jeff Winter. The comments by the speaker were interesting. However, combining yesterday's talk with the book I'm currently reading ("Contagion: The Financial Epidemic That is Sweeping the Global Economy... and How to Protect Yourself from It")is really bumming me out. Oh, and don't even ask me what I bought Citibank at. :(SummaryGovernment action has been significantSlump will bottom out in late 2009, with meaningful growth in 2010-11There are opportunitiesCheap assetsSome industries will do well: Health, basic foods, education, infrastructureHow long will the recession last?No guarantees, of course, but this quarter may be the bottom, next quarter a touch better, and modest recovery begins towards end of year (Bernanke agrees)No meaningful recovery until 2010-11FYI  EIU is suspicion of US predictions of 4% GDP growth in Obama's budgetHousing is key. When housing prices recover, so will the economyUS, UK Japan expected to decline 2.5  5% GDP in 2009Very aggressive stimulus across the globe (US stimulus is 5.7% of GDP; Chinas is approaching 15%!)Interesting factsGlobal recession - First time since 1930s that total global output contractsBanks will take longer than rest of economy to recover (balance sheet adjustments take years to fix)Housing pricing are falling at an accelerating rate for 21 months (i.e. each month, prices are falling at a faster rate the month before)Consumer spending is 70% of US economyrecovery wont happened until consumers return &gt; savings rate has sky-rocketed, hindering recoveryThree crises, feeding on themselvesFinancial crisis  leverage, bank write-downs, credit freezeDeveloped world recession  withdrawal of credit, spending and investment declineEmerging market crunch  significant drop, but emerging markets still growing (e.g. China @6% GDP)- I asked a follow up question about outlook for Mexico/Brazil. Didn't get as much expansion on this subject as I would like. However, Mexico with it's severe dependency on the US is likely going to get hit harder than Brazil. He thought Brazil's financial sector was in relatively decent shape.Two groupsDebtor nations  have to sell assets to pay down debtprevents recovery (Uh, this is us, er US)Creditor nations  have no export marketsChinaVulnerability potentialNote  this is NOT a prediction, but rather a riskSlower growth &gt; production slows &gt; workers idled / layoffs &gt; profits squeezed &gt; bad loans increase (much borrowing from China) &gt; banks struggle (similar to US?) &gt; SOCIAL UNRESTJapanBack in recessionGDP contracted 12% n Q4! 5.5% contraction predicted for 2009Japans biggest issue is lack of export marketsRisk of deflation  Japan more like Germany than USEmerging marketsHurting, but better than off than developed nationsThree issuesReduced exportsLess inward investment from rich nations (FDI)More difficult for indebted nations to borrowEuropeFull blown crisisUK hit hardestIndustrial production and housing marketHow are businesses reacting?Strategic acquisitions (if you have money, assets are cheap)Increased response to key accounts is by far #1 response in surveyMuch more focus on risk  organizationally, more reports, investmentsOff-shoring  China and India still most popular place
