FXstreet.com (Barcelona) - Despite that The Reserve Bank of Australia is anticipated to lower the official cash rate by another 25bp to 3.00% in an effort to keep the $1T economy afloat, RBA left its cash rate target unchanged at 3.25%, having already cut the rate by a total of 400 basis points between September 2008 and February. The decision signals an end to aggressive interest rate cuts as the central bank allows significant monetary and fiscal stimulus already flowing to the economy time to work. By leaving rates unchanged, the RBA has given itself room to respond later should the global and domestic economic pictures deteriorate further.
