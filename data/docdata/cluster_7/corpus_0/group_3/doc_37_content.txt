Stock markets around the world have fallen dramatically today. This is following the ongoing events in the financial world, including statements by several UK politicians, including the Prime Minister Gordon Brown. The British FTSE 100 index was one the indexes that today suffered from large falls. It fell by 5.00% to slip below the four thousand mark, at 3883.36 points. Both major US indexes suffered from falls of over two per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 252.01 points (2.90%) to 8439.24 by 1730 UTC, while the Nasdaq index experienced a 2.30% drop. South American markets performed particularly badly today. By 1730 UTC, the Argentinean MERVAL index had fallen by almost six per cent to 906.160 points, while the Brazilian Bovespa, fell by 6.89% (2,328.45 points) to a value of 31,490.04. David Buik of BGC Partners commented on today&amp;#8217;s falls. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s carnage,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;Confidence is shot to ribbons. We need action now. It is a catastrophe that we have got to recession, but we have got to learn to live with it, and that means saving the markets.&amp;#8221; Market data    17:30, 24 October, 2008 (UTC)     DJIA    8,378.47  312.78  3.60%     Nasdaq    1,564.55  39.36  2.45%     S&amp;amp;P 500    875.61  32.50  3.58%     S&amp;amp;P TSX    9,080.72  250.63  2.69%     IPC    16,899.20  899.78  5.06%     Merval    906.160  57.540  5.97%     Bovespa    31,490.04  2,328.45  6.89%     FTSE 100    3,883.36  204.47  5.00%     DAX    4,295.67  224.03  4.96%     CAC 40    3,193.79  117.08  3.54%     SMI    5,675.09  218.64  3.71%     AEX    245.92  11.93  4.63%     BEL20    1,918.08  65.06  3.28%     MIBTel    15,390.00  803.00  4.96%     IBEX 35    8,353.20  458.00  5.20%     All Ordinaries    3,831.60  107.70  2.73%     Nikkei    7,649.08  811.90  9.60%     Hang Seng    12,618.40  1,142.11  8.30%     SSE Composite    1,839.62  35.94  1.92%    Creative Commons Attribution 2.5  Overview: the Global Financial Crisis of 2008  In 2008, a global economic crisis was suggested by several important indicators of economic downturn worldwide. These included high oil prices, which led to both high food prices (due to a dependence of food production on petroleum, as well as using food as an alternative to petroleum) and global inflation; a substantial credit crisis leading to the bankruptcy of large and well established investment banks as well as commercial banks in various nations around the world; increased unemployment; and the possibility of a global recession. BRIEF  High commodity prices  The decade of the 2000s saw a commodities boom, in which the prices of primary commodities rose again after the Great Commodities Depression of 1980-2000. But in 2008, the prices of many commodities, notably oil and food, rose so high as to cause genuine economic damage, threatening stagflation and a reversal of globalization. In January 2008, oil prices surpassed $100 a barrel for the first time, the first of many price milestones to be passed in the course of the year. By July the price of oil reached as high as $147 a barrel although prices fell soon after. The food and fuel crises were both discussed at the 34th G8 summit in July. Sulfuric acid (an important chemical commodity used in processes such as steel processing, copper production and bioethanol production) increased in price 6-fold in less than 1 year while producers of sodium hydroxide have declared force majeur  due to flooding, precipitating similarly steep price increases. In the second half of 2008, the prices of most commodities fell dramatically on expectations of diminished demand in a world recession. Trade  In mid-October 2008, the Baltic Dry Index, a measure of shipping volume, fell by 50% in one week, as the credit crunch made it difficult for exporters to obtain letters of credit. Inflation  In February 2008, Reuters reported that global inflation was at historic levels, and that domestic inflation was at 10-20 year highs for many nations. &amp;#8220;Excess money supply around the globe, monetary easing by the Fed to tame financial crisis, growth surge supported by easy monetary policy in Asia, speculation in commodities, agricultural failure, rising cost of imports from China and rising demand of food and commodities in the fast growing emerging markets,&amp;#8221; have been named as possible reasons for the inflation.[7] In mid-2008, IMF data indicated that inflation was highest in the oil-exporting countries, largely due to the unsterilized growth of foreign exchange reserves, the term unsterilized referring to a lack of monetary policy operations that could offset such a foreign exchange intervention in order to maintain a countrys monetary policy target. However, inflation was also growing in countries classified by the IMF as &amp;#8220;non-oil-exporting LDCs&amp;#8221; (Least Developed Countries) and &amp;#8220;Developing Asia&amp;#8221;, on account of the rise in oil and food prices. Inflation was also increasing in the developed countries, but remained low compared to the developing world.  Unemployment The International Labor Organization predicted that at least 20 million jobs will have been lost by the end of 2009 due to the crisis - mostly in &amp;#8220;construction, real estate, financial services, and the auto sector&amp;#8221; - bringing world unemployment above 200 million for the first time. North America Canada  In May 2008 Canada&amp;#8217;s GDP was reported to have decreased 0.1 percent due to decline in mining, oil and gas industry by 1.2 percent and fall in Automobile production by 3.6 percent. Construction output in Canada declined 0.4 percent, utilities 1.3 percent, and farms produce 0.9 percent less. In the first quarter of 2008 Canada&amp;#8217;s economy shrank by 0.3 percent and the Bank of Canada said second quarter growth would likely be less than 0.8 percent projected. Canada later revised its first quarter GDP showing a contraction of 0.8% and gave second quarter GDP showing an increase of only 0.3%. U.S.  The United States entered 2008 during a housing market correction , a subprime mortgage crisis and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a 5-year record. In September, 159,000 jobs were lost, bringing the monthly average to 84,000 per month from January to September of 2008. Possible recession  In the early months of 2008, many observers believed that a U.S. recession had begun. As a direct result of the collapse of Bear Stearns , Global Insight increased the probability of a worse-than-expected recession to 40% (from 25% before the collapse). In addition, financial market turbulence signaled that the crisis will not be mild and brief. Alan Greenspan , ex- Chairman of the Federal Reserve , stated in March 2008 that the 2008 financial crisis in the United States is likely to be judged as the harshest since the end of World War II . A chief economist at Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;#8217;s , said in March 2008 he has a worst-case-scenario in which the country could endure a double-dip recession in which the economy would briefly recover in the summer 2008.  Under this scenario, the economy&amp;#8217;s total output, as measured by the gross domestic product, would drop by 2.2percentage points, making it the third worst recession in the post World War II period. The former head of the National Bureau of Economic Research said in March 2008 he believed the country was then in a recession, and it could be a severe one.  A number of private economists generally predicted a mild recession ending in the summer of 2008 when the economic stimulus checks going to 130million households started being spent. A chief economist at Moody&amp;#8217;s predicted in March 2008 that policymakers would act in a concerted and aggressive way to stabilize the financial markets, and that then the economy would suffer but not enter a prolonged and severe recession.  It takes many months before the National Bureau of Economic Research-committee, the unofficial arbiter of when recessions begin and end, makes its own ruling. According to numbers published by Bureau of Economic Analysis in May 2008, the GDP growth of the previous two quarters was positive. As one common definition of a recession is negative economic growth for at least two consecutive fiscal quarters, some analysts suggest this indicates that the U.S. economy was not in a recession at the time. However this estimate has been disputed by some analysts who argue that if inflation is taken into account, the GDP growth was negative for the past two quarters, making it a technical recession. In a May 9, 2008, report, the chief North American economist for investment bank Merrill Lynch wrote that despite the GDP growth reported for the first quarter of 2008, &amp;#8220;it is still reasonable to believe that the recession started some time between September and January&amp;#8221;, on the grounds that the National Bureau of Economic Research &amp;#8217;s four recession indicators all peaked during that period. New York&amp;#8217;s budget director concluded the state of New York was officially in a recession. Governor David Paterson called an emergency economic session of the state legislature for August 19 to push a budget cut of $600million on top of a hiring freeze and a 7percent reduction in spending at state agencies already implemented by the Governor. An August 1 report, issued by economists with Wachovia , said Florida was officially in a recession. White House budget director Jim Nussle said the U.S. avoided a recession following revised GDP numbers from the Commerce Department showing a 0.2percent contraction in the fourth quarter of 2007 down from a 0.6percent increase and a downward revision to 0.9percent from 1percent in the first quarter of 2008. The GDP for the second quarter was placed at 1.9percent below an expected 2percent. Martin Feldstein , who headed the National Bureau of Economic Research until June and serves on the group&amp;#8217;s recession-dating panel, said he believed the U.S. was in a...
