Austria did not need to raise the money, so it has decided to hold off but, if these conditions persist, it could prove a problem for some governments as their debt needs to be refinanced."Analysts warn that the huge pipeline of government bonds due to be issued in the fourth quarter and next year could increase problems for some countries, particularly those already carrying large amounts of debt that needs to be refinanced or rolled over. European government bond issuance will rise to record levels of more than 1,000bn in 2009 - 30 per cent higher than 2008 - as governments seek to stimulate their economies and pay for bank recapitalisations.The eurozone countries will raise 925bn ($1,200bn) in 2009, according to Barclays Capital. The UK, which is expected to increase its bond issuance from the current 137.5bn in the 2008-09 financial year, will take the figure above 1,000bn.Italy, with a debt-to-gross domestic product ratio of 104 per cent, is most exposed to continuing difficulties in the credit markets. Analysts forecast that it will need to raise 220bn in 2009.
