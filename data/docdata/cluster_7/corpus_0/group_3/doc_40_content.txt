Holger Schmieding, of Bank of America, has it right. He writes in the Wall Street Journal:Unfortunately, the policy discussion in Europe has now turned to outright government support for the nonfinancial economy and to blanket fiscal stimulus programs. Yet Europe's experience with government spending sprees is dismal. Such initiatives are usually implemented too late to cushion the downturn and are typically hijacked by special-interest groups, often achieving no more than a blatant waste of money. To make any sense, fiscal programs in Europe need to combine a short-term increase in domestic demand with a long-term incentive to work more and invest better, thus raising the economy's growth potential. And they need to be fast to be effective in the current recession. The best stimulus that meets these criteria is a tax cut. In many European countries, payroll taxes or other government-mandated, nonwage labor costs place major burdens on wage earners and businesses alike, with the two sides often sharing the costs. Reducing these payroll taxes would augment the purchasing power of consumers, cut costs for businesses and provide an incentive to fire fewer workers now and hire more in the coming upswing
