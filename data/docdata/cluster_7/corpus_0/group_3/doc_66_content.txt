Wizard Home Loans has followed Australia's big banks and cut its variable interest rates by 80 basis points after the Reserve Bank of Australia's surprise 100 basis point cut to the official cash rate. Wizard will lower its standard variable rate to 8.49 per cent from Friday for new customers, and from Thursday, October 16 for its existing customers, the lender said in a statement on Thursday morning. The interest rate on Wizard's flagship Rate Breaker home loan product will drop to 7.08 per cent. Wizard chairman, Mark Bouris, said the company was making the rate cut despite it lacking access to lower cost funding through retail deposits.news.smh.com.au
