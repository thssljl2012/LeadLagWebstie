Not sure if this should be here (seeing as its Australian) or in the economics section, but either way...  With the economic crisis deepening, the Reserve Bank of Australia is very likely to cut interest rates by either 25 or 50 basis points. It is unlikely that the major banks will pass all, if any, of this onto the public.   In fact, members of the Government have even encouraged this, saying that the richer our banks are, the better they will be able to ride out this economic crisis. This seems a bit of a cop-out by the Government, a way of admitting they have absolutely no power over the banking industry whatsoever.   If the banks don't lower their interest rates according to the change in the RBA, consumer and business confidence isn't going to improve, which means a rate cut will do very little to improve our economy.   Is there any way the Government could actually enforce the major banks to make that sort of interest rate change, for the sake of our economy?  (btw, if i'm completely wrong about the whole situation, let me know, i nearly failed economics last year :mrgreen:)
