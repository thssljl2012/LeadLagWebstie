Threee years or more is usually a long term mortgage. Short-term mortgages are appropriats for buyers who believe interest rates will drop at renewal time. Long-term mortgages are suitable when current rates arw reasonable and borrowers want the security of budgeting for the future. The key to choosing between short and lonh terms is to feel comfortable with your mortgage payments.  After a term expires, the balance of the principal owing on the mortgage can repaid, or a new mortgage agreement can be established at the then-current interest rates. Open mortgages can be paid off at any time without penaalty and are usually negotiated for a very short term. Homeowners who are planning to sell in the near future or those who want the flexibility to make large, lump-sum payments before maturity will find this type of residential mortgage helpful.
