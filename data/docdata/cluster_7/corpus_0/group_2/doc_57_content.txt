 With Lehman Brothers filing for bankruptcy protection and Bank of America acquiring Merrill Lynch this weekend, consumers may feel helpless in this uncertain economic environment.  However, consumers should empower themselves during these chaotic times by using online rate comparison tables to stay atop rate trends and changes.  In light of this weekends events, a new focus has been placed on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting scheduled for Tuesday.  Prior to this weekend, the prospect of the Federal Reserve lowering the Fed Funds rate was slim.  However, currently, Fed Funds futures imply a heightened chance of a 25 basis point reduction, with some analysts believing a 50 basis point reduction is likely.  A 25 basis point reduction would lower the Fed Funds rate from 2.00% to 1.75%.  Regardless of what happens with the Fed Funds Rate or various financial giants, consumers should regularly check interest rates online in order to maximize interest earned and minimize interest paid.  By constantly checking rates online, consumers can make the most of their mortgage, loans, and savings in any rate environment.
