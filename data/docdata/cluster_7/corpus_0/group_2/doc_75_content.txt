 Short sellers got squeezed big time today. My Wells Fargo shares went up 33%, and Bank of America went up 22%. This happened because Wells Fargo reported better than expected earnings for the quarter this morning. Short selling, for those not familiar, is the process of borrowing shares which you immediately sell, then buy back later, or "cover" when the price has dropped. You then return the shares to the original owner and pocket the difference. This would be useful if you think that the price of shares will be going down. Little problem with that. The risk profile is completely opposite of normal investing. The most you can lose normally is the amount you invested. The potential gains are unlimited. With short selling, your loss is potentially unlimited instead. I never short sell for that reason. What happened today is that as the price quickly rose, short sellers were forced to cover their positions to avoid larger losses, and that buying made the price go up even more. That's a short squeeze.Similar posts:  michael jackson game
