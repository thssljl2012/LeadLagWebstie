Mortgage rates spiked today in Orange County as investors sold mortgage-backed securities and bought stocks instead amid President Bush&amp;#8217;s plan to buy sour mortgages and other bad debt, said Jeff Altman, a partner and mortgage broker with WestCal Mortgage Corp. in Orange. Happy about bailout The lowest rate available today on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage up to the old conforming limit of $417,000 rose to 5.75% with a one-point fee, from 5.5% earlier this week, he said. When prices of mortgage securities drop, as they did today, their yields rise, and that leads to higher consumer rates, Altman said. Also, Treasury bond yields rose today and such moves are associated with higher mortgage rates. Mortgage rates should eventually ease back down as the plan is digested, Altman said.

It will help end the credit crunch by freeing up the capital of banks, but it will not immediately boost O.C.&amp;#8217;s housing market, Altman said. That&amp;#8217;s partly because nothing Bush or Congress have done so far or plan to do are leading to easier credit access for borrowers in the short term, he said. For example, Altman said before the housing boom some borrowers could state their income instead of providing income documentation and get a home loan with a 20% down payment. During the boom, that down payment requirement disappeared, which led to toxic home loans. But now, it is nearly impossible to get a stated-income loan even with 20% down, he said. Such changes mean anyone without a perfect, cookie-cutter profile is having a hard time getting a mortgage, he said. &amp;#8220;Somebody needs to wake up in Washington on the mortgage industry,&amp;#8221; Altman said. Altman and other housing watchers expect swift Congressional approval of the plan. Chip Hanlon, president of Delta Global Advisors in Huntington Beach and founder of&amp;nbsp;Greenfaucet.com, agreed Bush&amp;#8217;s plan is driving up mortgage rates but will lead to more money for home loans in the long run. &amp;#8220;This may not end the credit crisis, but it will grease the wheels in the short-term,&amp;#8221; Hanlon said. &amp;#8220;When commercial real estate becomes the next troubled, headline-making mess in this financial unwinding, it remains to be seen if credit markets will seize up once again. They might, and we&amp;#8217;re convinced this is the next big financial shoe to drop.&amp;#8221; Yikes.
