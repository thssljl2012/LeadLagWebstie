I didn&amp;#8217;t have any coffee this morning and man am I feeling it. Its like someone punched you in the head and then told you to get up and go to work. Is this what a coffee-less lifestyle feels like? Because if loving coffee is so wrong, I don&amp;#8217;t want to be right. If Jennifer Lopez was a stock, her ticker symbol would be JLO. If Valero had stock, which it does, its ticker symbol would be VRO. I finally shorted my Valero stocks today. The profit was downright measly, but the practice was priceless. I think in a market like this it would be easier to find the companies that are going to go down so being particularly skilled at shorting could be really useful. I fully understand the concept now, I just need to work on my timing. PredictWallStreet has published more forecasts today. Apple (AAPL) is forecasted to close up today surprisingly. Even after the AIG bailout, 95% of stocks in the S&amp;amp;P 500 are posting losses. Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Merrill Lynch (MER) are forecasted to close down. Sentiment for Bank of America is extremely bullish right now. The sentiment meter on the front page also shows sentiment for the major indices. The NASDAQ has moved up into the bullish part of the meter. There don&amp;#8217;t seem to be to many buyers out in the market right now, but judging by sentiment it seems investors are still hopeful. Even with all the uncertainty and even though no one is buying, maybe this is still the time to buy while prices are so low. Buy low, sell high, right?       Delicious Digg Facebook   Stumble It!
