LOL. Nice try, Nick. I&amp;#8217;m not suggesting the ATO (or the government) go into offering banking services, or even modest intermediation services. That was tried and abandoned with the split-up of the RBA and Commonwealth Bank, and subsequent privatisation of the CBA. I am suggesting that the ATO pay interest on cash balances on money belonging to the public. That would provide decent incentives to the ATO and help your friend.
