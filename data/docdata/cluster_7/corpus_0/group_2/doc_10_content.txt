 You know that there is a problem, when I open with ratings downgrades.We have S&amp;amp;P downgrading Washington Mutual to junk status, and even more significantly, AIG, the largest insurance company in the world has been downgraded by Fitch Ratings to A from AA-, and S&amp;amp;P and Moody's downgraded them too, from to A- from AA- for S&amp;amp;P, and to to A2 from Aa3 for Moody's.This is ugly, and it is not surprising that the costs of corporate bond insurance has skyrocketed on what is called "counterparty risk" by the MBA types, and the belief that you are dealing with a bunch of lying bastards foo the rest of us.It's the same reason that the costs of overnight borrowing has gone up too, with the LIBOR more than doubling from 3.10625% to 6.43750%.No one knows when the next shoe is going to drop, and even the additional $70 billion that the Fed dropped out of helicopters wasn't much help.It's why we're seeing Thornburg Mortgage struggle under a sudden onslaught of margin calls.When Goldman Sachs earnings 70%, even though they hedged against the real estate crash, you know that no one is making money.And at the end of all this the Fed decided to leave interest rates unchanged, which is not surprising, since they are already pushing on a string.Meanwhile, the dollar is behaving like my cat when he gets outside in a rain squall, it really did not move, but you can see the conflict between fear driving people to dollars, and the fear of the US financial meltdown driving people away from the dollar.We actually saw consumer prices fall, driven by falling energy prices (oil is now about $91.15/bbl on demand concerns from the financial meltdown)Gasoline still went up, driven by the came hurricane refinery concerns that have driven prices over the past 4 or so days.
