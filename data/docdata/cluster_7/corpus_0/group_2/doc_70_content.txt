NZHerald is reporting the ANZ review of jobs  See email below from Council of Trade Unions CTU MEDIA RELEASE 25 September 2008 ANZ commitment to NZ again in question  "ANZ's commitment to the New Zealand public and its workforce is in question again today following further restructuring at a bank which made a $1.1 billion profit off New Zealanders last year," Council of Trade Unions president Helen Kelly said today. "In April ANZ said that they would be increasing customer representation by investing in new branches and growing the number of customer-facing staff." "Today they have backtracked on earlier commitments to staff. And this is an unnecessary move from such a profitable bank." "Kiwis quickly tire of large foreign owned banks who make multimillion dollar profits off the back of New Zealand but show scant regard for workers and the domestic economy." "Customers should take this into consideration when determining who they bank with," Helen Kelly said. [CTU Media Release] There are apparently at least 180 Maori and Pacific staff working at ANZ. What do you think about ANZ going to India ?
