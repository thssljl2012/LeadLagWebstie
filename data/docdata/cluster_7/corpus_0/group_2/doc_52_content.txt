By Shilpa Shree Sep 16 2008, Mumbai                                       After Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, the focus seems to have now shifted to AIG, world's largest insurer, and its investments in India's real estate sector.Sensing rough weather ahead, RMZ Corp, a Bangalore-based real estate company, where AIG has made investments, is now taking stock of AIG investement in the company.We cannot comment over AIG investments in our company now. We will be meeting over the next few days to discuss this issue, said Sonali Lalvani, head marketing and communication, RMZ Corp. AIG Global Real Estate fund has a joint venture with RMZ Corp to develop commercial and hospitality projects. Both the companies were supposed to extend their joint venture plans to retail and residential verticals as well, which according to analysts might not take off.AIG has invested in RMZ Ecospace, an office project in Kolkata which has got LEEDs platinum certified green building, which according to Lalvani, is the first office project to be identified under the JV.While the exact investment in this project is not known, Financial Chronicle has learnt from a senior AIG official that the insurance major has invested around Rs 298 crore to buy 11 acres of land in Chennai to build 1.5 million sq ft of office space. Besides RMZ investments, said a senior official from one of the major real estate consultancy firms, AIG has invested in three other real estate projects in the country. Financial Chronicle could not independently verify these investments.In January 2008, AIG was in talks with Mumbai-based real estate company, Akruti City to pick up stake at an entity level. Akruti specialises in redevelopment projects. We called off the deal due to technical issues, said Hemant Shah, chairman of BSE-listed Akruti City. Besides investing in real estate projects AIG also had plans of launching real estate mutual funds and real estate investment trusts.
