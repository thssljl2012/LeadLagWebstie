Seagate Technology (STX)  The latest data from ChangeWave Research paints a grim picture for the   information technology (IT) sector. According to the research firm, 30% of   businesses cut IT spending in the third quarter, while 29% reported that they   will cut or stop spending altogether in the fourth quarter. This news follows   closely on the heels of reports from Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and other large-cap   technology companies that they are seeing slowdowns in corporate IT spending,   potentially impacting revenue.  The newfound frugal nature of corporate IT spending could impact the hardware   sector particularly hard, as there is plenty of investor optimism blanketing the   group. Specifically, nearly 57% of the 149 analysts' ratings on the components   of the AMEX Hardware Index (HWI) are a "buy" or better. Meanwhile, the HWI has   plunged more than 25% since early November, pulling its 10-week and 20-week   moving averages into a bearish cross in the process. The index is now struggling   to find support in the 200 region, but any downgrades from Wall Street analysts   on continued reports of a slowdown in corporate IT spending could force the HWI   below this level and spark another downleg for the sector.  Within the sector, Seagate Technologies (STX) has been one of the biggest   underperformers this year. The stock has shed more than 48% since the beginning   of 2008, declining steadily under resistance at its 10-week and 20-week moving   averages. Additionally, STX has failed to reclaim long-term technical support at   the 15 level, despite battling this resistance for the better part of the past 2   months. The brief trek above the 15 level in early August was halted by the   stock's 10-week trendline, which has now descended into the 15 region itself.   Seemingly exhausted from the battle, STX has now broken out to a series of new   multi-year lows, and is poised to extend its run lower.    Despite this poor technical performance and the rumblings of slowing IT   spending, investors are attempting to call a bottom to STX's decline. In the   options pits, the stock's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of   0.51 indicates that calls nearly double puts among options with less than 3   months until expiration. Furthermore, this ratio ranks below 72% of all those   taken during the past year, indicating that traders have been more optimistic   toward STX only 28% of the time in the prior 52 weeks.  The majority of these bullishly oriented call options are situated at the   deep out-of-the-money 22.50 strike in the September series, totaling roughly   11,000 contracts. However, with the stock's recent decline, call activity has   ramped up at the overhead 15 strike, with open interest in the September and   October series now totaling more than 8,200 contracts. By comparison, roughly   13,200 put contracts are open at the in-the-money 15 strike for the same time   frame. With practically no put open interest below the shares and a heavy skew   toward overhead call contracts, it would seem that investors are not expecting   STX to fall much further, creating downside risk for the equity.   Meanwhile, Wall Street is firmly entrenched in the bullish camp. According to   Zacks.com, 11 of the 20 analysts following STX rate the shares a "buy" or   better. Should more reports emerge highlighting the slowing business IT   environment, we could see these bullish analysts begin to rethink their   positions. As such, any downgrades from this group could increase selling   pressure on the security.  Option players should consider an in-the-money (15 strike) intermediate-term   put option  the December put (premium is 32% of the stock price) or January   2009 put (premium is 34% of the stock price) - to take advantage of this   opportunity that is attractive from our Expectational Analysis   methodology perspective.  Starbucks (SBUX)  Java giant Starbucks (SBUX) was the subject of unusual option activity last   week. More specifically, the stock saw about 23,000 puts cross the tape on   Thursday, 6.8 times the security's average daily put volume. On the flip side,   SBUX also saw about 23,000 calls change hands, nearly 6 times the stock's   average daily call volume.   Digging deeper into the data, we find that the most popular bearish bet on   Thursday was the October 15 put, with 18,350 contracts crossing the tape.   Meanwhile, call traders honed in on the equity's October 16 strike, which also   saw more than 18,300 contracts change hands. This duo of strikes is home to peak   put and call open interest in both the September and October series of options.     So, which side of the Street are near-term options speculators leaning   toward? Judging by the coffee king's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio    measuring options slated to expire within 3 months  of 0.89, in the 75th   percentile, it seems that short-term option players are skewed toward the bears'   lair, as this ranking is less than 25 percentage points away from an annual   pessimistic peak.   Also on the skeptical side of the spectrum are the majority of analysts, with   Zacks reporting that only 3 of the 11 ranking brokers deem SBUX a "buy"   or better. However, one analyst sprinkled some cream and sugar on the company   last week. Oppenheimer analyst Matthew DiFrisco claimed that he has "increased   confidence in [Starbucks'] ongoing turnaround, despite the broader persistent   economic headwinds facing consumer discretionary spending." The broker opined   that the firm is taking the right steps to turn its business around, noting the   strong performance of some of the company's new products, including its recent   oatmeal line.   Aside from the bullish brokerage note, is the lingering wariness regarding   the joe-providing company warranted? Taking a look at the stock from a technical   standpoint, it's not difficult to see why most of the Street is somewhat   doubtful. Since peaking near the 40 level in late 2006, the shares of SBUX have   more than halved themselves, and are currently trading near the 15.60 level. The   security has been pressured lower beneath resistance from its 10-month moving   average, a trendline the equity hasn't defeated in nearly 2 years.   In conclusion, in order for SBUX to overcome the pessimism, the   aforementioned trendline will more than likely need to be perforated. Until   then, it will probably be difficult for this frappucino firm to defy the bears.       Western Digital (WDC)  Computer hard-disk drive manufacturer Western Digital (WDC) has seen better   days. Following a sharp run higher in 2007, the stock has withered about 25% so   far in 2008. During this fall from grace, WDC has found resistance at its   10-week moving average - a trendline that once provided staunch support for the   shares. Meanwhile, since being rejected at round-number resistance at the 40   level, WDC has been pressured lower by its 10-day and 20-day moving averages,   hitting a new annual low of $21.41 on Tuesday.   However, options players remain decidedly optimistic toward WDC. The stock's   SOIR has dropped precipitously in recent weeks, falling from its near-term high   of 0.92 on August 28 to its current perch at 0.82, in the 33rd percentile. Not   only does this drop indicate that options traders have grown more bullish toward   the stock despite its decline, it also means that speculators have been more   optimistic only a third of the time during the past year. This degree of extreme   bullish sentiment has bearish implications for WDC given the stock's poor   technical performance.  Turning to Wall Street, Zacks.com reports that 8 of the 15 analysts   covering the shares rate them a "buy" or better. Any downgrades from the   brokerage bunch could provide a catalyst to extend the stock's poor price   action.  This article summarizes the prospects for Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO: sentiment, chart, options) , which recently endured a   10% correction from its record price of $62.75 on August 22. One positive factor   cited is the stock's attractive price-to-earnings ratio, which is hovering near   a 5-year low.  Additionally, the author cites "new products, successful cost-cutting, and a   steady string of small acquisitions of scientific-equipment companies" for   boosting TMO's profit and revenue figures in the 2 years since the company was   created by the merger of Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific.  Finally, this bullish write-up points out that TMO "generates lots of cash"   that could be spent on stock buybacks. Coincidentally enough, the company   announced a stock-repurchase plan worth $500 million the same day this article   was published.     Contrarian Takeaway:  The stock may be taking a bit of a breather following its impressive run   higher this summer, but TMO's long-term uptrend remains firmly intact. For   years, the equity has enjoyed double-barreled support from its 10-month and   20-month moving averages, and these trendlines show no signs of weakening. This   strong performance suggests that the shares are poised to extend their journey   higher.  As TMO continues to gain, there's some pessimism lingering among skeptical   investors. The stock's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio is 0.93, which   ranks higher than 88% of other such reading in the past year. In other words,   short-term option players have been more bearish just 12% of the time in the   previous 52 weeks.  A continuation of the recent short-covering trend could also support TMO's   rally. Short interest on the shares fell by 2.6% during the most recent   reporting period, but the remaining accumulation of pessimistic bets represents   5.4 times the equity's average daily volume. This leaves TMO with a healthy   stockpile of sideline cash to extend its long-term uptrend.
