 The two largest US  investment banks, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley, reported lower  quarterly profits, but beat expectations on Tuesday even as the worst market  slump in decades rattled Wall Street.Goldman Sachs, the largest  securities firm, said third quarter earnings fell 70 percent on  weaker-than-expected revenues, knocking its shares to nearly three-year  lows.Later, No 2 Morgan Stanley, which reported a day ahead of schedule  after US markets closed, trounced expectations paced by one-time gains, robust  equity and commodities trading results and record prime brokerage  fees.Morgan's earnings fell 3 percent even as the year-old credit crunch  slowed deal activity and created one of the toughest trading environments in  decades. Its shares fell 11 percent on Tuesday in regular trading, though they  pared most of those losses in electronic trading after New York markets  closed.Goldman shares also climbed after the bell, up 4  percent."Between Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, we are getting some  modest positive news in what has been an otherwise dark five-day period," said  Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment officer of Fifth Third Asset  Management.Tough TimesThe results come a day after No 4  investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy, swamped by  mortgage losses. No 3 broker Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co Inc meanwhile rushed into  the arms of Bank of America Corp to avoid a similar fate.These moves had  prompted questions about the viability of investment banks. Several analysts  predicted these firms would merge with commercial banks, which can tap pools of  deposits.Yet Morgan Stanley and Goldman dismissed those  concerns."It's not the business model. It's performance that matters,"  said Goldman chief financial officer David Viniar. "We've been able to compete  just fine."Morgan Stanley CFO Colm Kelleher also played down the need to  merge with a deposit-taking bank: "I'm very confident about the business model,  said in a phone interview.GoldmanGoldman's quarter was  marked by sharply lower banking, trading and investment results. It was the  investment bank's biggest earnings decline since it went public in  1999.Still it beat expectations, despite USD 1.1 billion in write-downs  and losses from principal investments. Some investors said Goldman deserved  credit for reporting any profit at all when rivals go bust or bleed red  ink."For them to perform in this manner, in this environment, is nothing  short of heroic," said Holland &amp;amp; Co Chairman Michael  Holland.Goldman's investment banking revenue dropped 40 percent amid a  dearth of deals. Debt trading revenue fell by two-thirds, primarily on weak  credit and mortgage markets, while equities trading revenue fell by  one-half.The latest quarter included USD 1.1 billion in losses on  corporate loans, residential and commercial mortgages, and USD 453 million of  principal investment losses, showing the downside of making aggressive bets with  house money. Asset management revenue fell 6 percent as clients withdrew a net  USD 7 billion."People were hoping for some good news in a sea of gloom  and I don't think they got it," said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager at Bahl  &amp;amp; Gaynor Investment Counsel.Analysts said Goldman beat expectations  because it paid unusually low taxes, an effective rate of 12 percent compared  with 34 percent last year.Morgan ResultsMorgan easily  out-earned its archrival and generated a higher return on equity. "This  is great news for the whole financial sector," said Marshall Front, chairman at  Front Barnett Associates. "I think the key to this whole thing was that they  looked better than Goldman Sachs' earnings earlier in the day."The  results included a USD 745 million one-time gain from its sales of MSCI Inc  stock and USD 1.4 billion of gains recorded because the credit spreads on its  own debt widened.And while the banking and trading division posted  strong results, wealth management results and asset management results both  fell. The ranks of brokers grew, rising 2 percent to 8,500.Morgan also  absorbed nearly USD 1.1 billion of losses and charges from mortgage trades,  investments, leveraged buyout loans and repurchase of illiquid auction rate  securities.Over the past year banks and brokers have recorded more than  USD 500 billion in write-downs as the mortgage crunch expanded into a sprawling  crisis that continues to claim new and larger victims.Goldman  acknowledged its earnings follow the global economy and that conditions will  remain challenging. The company said it is increasing capital and cash while  shedding risky assets."We've become even more cautious in our approach,"  Viniar told reporters. "There's a lot of fear in the marketplace."
