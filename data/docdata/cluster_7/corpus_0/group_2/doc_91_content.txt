The Singapore sovereign wealth fund, Temasek Holdings, has not yet decided what to do with its stake in Merrill Lynch, which is to be bought by Bank of America, reports AFP. Temasek Holdings, which holds about 13 to 14 per cent in the US investment bank, was not available for comment but Dow Jones Newswires, citing unnamed sources, said the Singapore firm was holding a meeting to discuss the matter, the report said. Temasek is the single largest investor in Merill Lynch after making investments totalling $8.3 billion, it added. Bank of America has agreed to buy Merrill Lynch for about $50 billion, or around $29 a share, report the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. Merrill stock has fallen 68 per cent in the past year, closing at $17.05 on Friday, reports CBC News.Temasek is selling off its power stations in Singapore.   It has signed an agreement with Lion Power -- a consortium led by Japan's Marubeni Corp and France's GDF Suez -- to sell Senoko Power, Singapore's biggest power station which supplies a third of Singapore's electricity, for 3.6 billion dollars ( $2.5 billion). It earlier sold Tuas, the smallest and most efficient power station in Singapore, to China's Huaneng group for 4.2 billion Singapore dollars, recalled the Financial Times. Temasek plans to sell Power Seraya, the third power station on offer, by the end of 2009, the report added. It noted the sales are part of a policy to liberalise the city-state's energy sector.
