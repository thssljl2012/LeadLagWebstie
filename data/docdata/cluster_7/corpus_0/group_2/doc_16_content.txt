The &amp;#8220;office&amp;#8221; of Graham Heunis responding to my query responded &amp;#8220;HSBC regretfully is required, from time to time, to increase our interest rates further, as a result of the increased costs of funds to HSBC, which enable us to provide Home Loan Products that are in line with the current market and Other Financial Institutes in Australia.&amp;#8221; So basically this means HSBC reserve the right to locally 1) copy other financial institutions (on rate increases) and/or 2) pass on its costs to your existing customer base Today the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its interest rate 25 points. The first time in 6 and a half years, so it&amp;#8217;ll be interesting to see if HSBC lowers its rate - other banks have. Wizard Home Loans locally should be applauded for lowering its rate a day before the announcement! Its a shame that HSBC are so poor at their own investments and awkward when they wrote to me to ask me to invest in BRIC countries. The HSBC Premier service is actually good. Still, I may still change loan provider if its better for the longer term.&amp;nbsp;
