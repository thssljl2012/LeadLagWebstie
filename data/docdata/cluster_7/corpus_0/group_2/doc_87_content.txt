Original Post on The Sun's Financial Diary Dow Jones Dropped The Most in Seven Years Last time the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index lost more 500 points in a single day was more than 7 years ago on September 17, 2001, shortly after the terrorist attack that brought down the World Trade Center. Today, the stock market was hammered by what happened not far away from where the towers used to stand: on the Wall Street, all the big financial names: Lehman Brothers (LEH), Merrill Lynch (MER), Bank of America (BOA), American International Group (AIG), Washington Mutual (WM). Trouble, trouble everywhere, even the $7+ plunge of oil price could stop the bloodshed. Only the closing bell did. Will tomorrow be better? Nobody knows. As long as the fate of AIG still hang in the balance (right now not many people are talking about WaMu), stocks will be under pressure. For investors, ING Direct has a piece of advice during this turbulent time: The best course of action &amp;#8230; is to be disciplined: avoid splurging; identify and cut out unnecessary expenses and save for what&amp;#8217;s essential; and hedge against those tough times. We can all benefit by developing good spending habits: confront - and cut up - credit cards; use your home as a savings vehicle - not as an ATM; and establish and contribute regularly to an IRA or 401(k). BTW, today&amp;#8217;s 504-point loss of the Dow is the sixth largest in the index&amp;#8217;s history. ---Check Out These Related Articles:The Worst &amp;#8220;Timing&amp;#8221; EverRandom News: The Dow Reshuffle, Postage Increase, and Actively Managed ETFsFirst Trust Introduces New Dividend ETF: Dow Jones Global Select Dividend Index FundHow Long Did The Dow Take to Add 1000 Points?Bank Dividend Yield Revisited
