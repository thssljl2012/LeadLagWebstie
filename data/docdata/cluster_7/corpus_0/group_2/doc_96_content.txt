Because of what's happening in the markets today I thought I'd repost this here:   Bank ratings     Highline Financial rates banks and thrifts for safety and   soundness on a scale of zero worst to 99 best. Here are its ratings, as of   the end of March, for the nation's largest bank holding companies and thrifts   compared with others in their peer group.
