       The last two weeks have been a crazy time for the financial sector. We had Lehman Brothers file for bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch rescued by Bank of America, the federal government taking control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and bailing out American International Group with a $85 billion loan. Closer to home, WaMu's shares sunk to $2.01 this week. There's no doubt this presents a challenging and discouraging time for America and obviously impacts those who have been considering buying a new home.   In Seattle, numbers from the NWMLS for August indicate that inventory has started leveling off with a total of 1,491 condos on the market, 9% higher than same time last year. On the bright side, back in January this year, we had ~65% higher inventory than January of 2007 so inventory trends are coming down.   Median prices for August ($310,000) have fared better than the previous month ($299,975) but are still lower than a year ago which was $327,500. This is a 5.34% drop versus the same time last year. Compared to other cities, we are still experiencing a minor drop in median prices but it's unclear if Seattle will continue to be an oasis of fairly stable prices in light of what's going in in the rest of the country.
