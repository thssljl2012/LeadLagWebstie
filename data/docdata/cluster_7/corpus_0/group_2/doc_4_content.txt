The US Government over the past several months has turned into a formidable distressed investing Private Equity shop. The General Partners (Uncle Sam and team) have said that the Limited Partners (taxpayers) will have limited exposure if any. Hmmm&amp;#8230;not sure how the deals werestructuredbut as a Limited Partner I&amp;#8217;m hoping to get a peak at the term sheets. Anyways, let&amp;#8217;s take a look at their recent deals: Bear Sterns - This deal is very unique from a PE perspective, JPMorgan owns 100% of the company assets and Uncle Sam is potentially liable for 100% of the debt. I&amp;#8217;m not sure what the exit is for Uncle Sam, it seems there is no upside and only downside. Fannie/Freddie - Although they areseparateentities I&amp;#8217;ll treat them as one. Uncle Sam again owns nothing in these entities buthas some pull as they fired the CEO&amp;#8217;s of both entities when the deal was announced.Uncle Sam is on the hook for USD 5 trillion in mortgages that Fannie/Freddie own. (I believe that is the first time I&amp;#8217;ve used the word trillion on my blog). AIG - Finally a deal where Uncle Sam has some skin in the game at 79.9% equity. AIG has access to a loan facility of upto USD 85 billion at LIBOR + 850 basis points. I hope as a limited partner I can get some insurance discounts from AIG. As with any PE shop I hope they are looking to diversify, the financials seem a bit risky. I suggest they look at the automotive sector, I hear Cerberus Capital is getting raked over the coals with Chrysler.
