Official interests rates will almost certainly go down today.&amp;nbsp; Half a percent?&amp;nbsp; A quarter? Stay the same?&amp;nbsp; The poor old Opposition are dreading a fall, scared to death that the new government will get the credit.&amp;nbsp; The fear prompted Brendan Nelson&amp;#8217;s extraordinary comments yesterday, an attempt to make a fall look like a bad thing:  &amp;#8220;When you look at all of the indicators somebody has to say it. I think we&amp;#8217;re in the environment where the Reserve could easily justify a 50 basis point cut.&amp;nbsp; Looking back over the last six months, with a Government that essentially egged the Reserve Bank on to be quite bullish in its behaviour, and to see the sharp decline in employment growth, and to see the forecasts for the next six months and indeed the next 12 months, clearly Australians need and deserve a cut in rates.&amp;#8221;  A politician commenting on interest rate movements?&amp;nbsp; As Dennis Atkins notes, &amp;#8220;Nelson gave the game away by admitting it was a highly unusual thing to do, adding he wouldn&amp;#8217;t make the same demand if he was Prime Minister.&amp;#8221;  How responsible of him.   Of course, monetary policy, interest rate movements, are in the hands of the Reserve Bank.&amp;nbsp; They are dealing with a problematic international situation, mixed pressures domestically, and the usual uncertainties about overall conditions.&amp;nbsp; You&amp;#8217;d expect them to be fairly cautious, so I reckon it might be a .25% cut.&amp;nbsp; With maybe another to follow later in the year.   ELSEWHERE: Peter Martin looks at what Treasurer Costello said at the time of the last interest rate cut, seven years ago:  &amp;#8220;What we&amp;#8217;re trying to do is we are trying to ensure that in a global economic downturn, and the United States, the world&amp;#8217;s largest economy, is in recession, the world&amp;#8217;s second largest economy, Japan, is in recession, in a global economic downturn, that we can keep Australia strong.&amp;#8221;  I guess he meant &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;re&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8221; in the sense of the Reserve Bank.&amp;nbsp; Be interesting to read the Reserve&amp;#8217;s statement if there is a rate cut today.   UPDATE: The cut is .25%:  THE Reserve Bank cut interest rates for the first time in nearly seven years in a move that should save households about $50 a month.&amp;nbsp; The central bank, which before today had raised official rates 12 times since early 2002, reduced rates to 7 per cent from 7.25 per cent amid a slowing economy.   The decision was widely expected by the financial markets, which are already speculating there will be further rate cuts later this year and in the first half of 2009.   The easing by 25 basis points today is the first reduction since December 2001....The pressure will now intensify on the major commercial banks to pass on the entire rate cut to homeowners. This would save households about $54 a month on an average $300,000 mortgage.   Two of Australia&amp;#8217;s five biggest commercial banks, National Australia Bank and ANZ, have already committed to giving customers the savings.  You can read the Reserve&amp;#8217;s statement here.   UPDATE: The majors have said they will pass on the cut, while St George has topped it:  St George Bank stole a march on its major rivals today by cutting its standard variable home loan rate by 30 basis points, or 0.3 percentage point, which was slightly more than the reduction sanctioned by the Reserve Bank.  It won&amp;#8217;t come into effect until the end of the month, however.
