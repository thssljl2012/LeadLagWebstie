Central banks act to calm marketsBy Ralph Atkins in Frankfurt and Norma Cohen in LondonCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2008Published: September 18 2008 09:10   Last updated: September 18 2008 12:07The worlds main central banks on Thursday unveiled an emergency $180bn injection of dollar liquidity in the latest attempt to halt the escalating global financial market crisis.The US Federal Reserve announced it was making available the extra funding to overnight and longer-term money markets. In a joint statement, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and Swiss National Bank pledged they would continue to work closely together and will take appropriate steps to address the ongoing pressures.Their action followed the dramatic escalation of financial market tensions following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the rescue of the AIG insurer and the continuing crisis on Wall Street. By Wednesday, lending between banks in Europe and in the US had in effect halted.The intervention had an immediate impact on overnight interbank lending rates which had risen to stressed levels on Wednesday. The overnight rate was fixed at 3.84 per cent down from 5.03 per cent the previous day.However, longer term interbank lending rates continued to rise in a sign that banks remain nervous about the liquidity of their peers.The timing, so early in the trading day, shows both the severity of the strains in the interbank market and as well the authorities determination to resuscitate orderly functioning of the money markets, said Julian Callow, European economist at Barclays Capital.The news had an immediate impact on Asian equity markets. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng rose as much as 0.4 per cent higher after earlier falling as much as 7.7 per cent on the back of Wednesdays sharp sell-off on Wall Street. But after a volatile session the index ended slightly lower for the day at its lowest level since October.In Europe, stocks also responded positively, with the FTSE Eurofirst 300 climbing 0.6 per cent and Londons FTSE 100 up 1.4 per cent to 4,982.6.These measures address funding difficulties, but do not address the primary risk of further bank writedowns, said Chris Turner at ING.Yields on two-year Treasury bills rose to 1.76 per cent as risk appetite returned. On Tuesday yields on short-term US Treasuries fell to their lowest levels since 1941.The gap between the two-year yield and US interest rate swaps dropped to around 110 basis points, from a record high of around 133bps before the liquidity action was announced.The collective intervention by some of the worlds largest central banks pushed the yen lower against the dollar and the euro as risk appetite improved. The dollar, which has also widely been used as a funding currency, also suffered.But gold added to Wednesdays record gains, rising more than 1.5 per cent to $876.30, after gaining more than 11 per cent or $33.50 the previous session as investors continued to worry about the outlook for the global economy.Under the latest action plan drawn up by central bankers, the ECB said it would expand its armoury by offering for as long as needed $40bn in overnight funds to eurozone banks.The ECB is also expanding its reciprocal arrangements with the US Fed to increase to $25bn the amount it provides in the market for 28-day funds and $15bn over 84 days. Under the expanded plans, the amount of outstanding dollar liquidity provided by the ECB could reach as much as $110bn  compared with $50bn previously.The Bank of England moved to add additional funds into the stressed sterling markets, announcing that it would renew the 25bn it loaned the banking sector earlier this week for another seven days and expanded the ability of banks to borrow from their own funds kept on deposit at the central bank.The Bank of Japan has agreed make available $60bn of dollar liquidity, and the Bank of Canada $10bn.After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, commercial banks found themselves short of cash and overnight bank borrowing costs soared around the world.Additional reporting by Peter GarnhamFear of money market funds breaking the buckBy Deborah Brewster in New York and Joanna Chung in WashingtonCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2008Published: September 17 2008 19:32   Last updated: September 17 2008 19:32Operators of money market funds, which manage a record $3,500bn, were on Wednesday rushing to reassure investors while bracing themselves to make further bail-outs of their funds. There were fears of a run on funds following news that one had broken the buck.Wachovia said it would back $494m (350m, 280m) worth of Lehman Brothers debt held in its Evergreen money market funds, rather than let the funds fall below the amount investors paid in  or breaking the buck.The Reserve Primary Fund, the oldest in the US, said on Tuesday night that investors could lose money as a result of it holding debt in Lehman, which has filed for bankruptcy.It is the first time in 14 years the value of a money market fund has been allowed to fall below the amount investors paid in and is a signal that ripples from the financial crisis have begun directly to affect retail investors.Money market funds safety has been of serious concern to regulators because they are considered by retail investors to be as secure as a bank account  but they have lost value during the credit crisis and are not backed by any government guarantee.In a sign that it expected further bail-outs, the US Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday that management companies providing support for their money market funds did not have to bring the funds assets on to balance sheets.Fund group parents  such as Wachovia and Legg Mason  have already spent more than $8bn since the start of the credit crisis bailing out their money market funds to prevent them from breaking the buck, fearing this could trigger a run on the funds and inflict lasting reputational damage on the parent company.Money market funds have attracted huge inflows in the past year as investors have looked for a safe haven amid credit market turmoil and faltering stock markets.Invesco, which has $90bn in money market funds, on Wednesday said: None of our US money market portfolios has any exposure to Lehman Brothers, AIG or Washington Mutual.Both Deutsche Bank and Fifth Third told investors their money funds held no Lehman or AIG debt. Northern Trust, another big operator, said it held Lehman debt as well as stock in its funds  it did not specify which funds  and it was actively monitoring the holdings. Legg Mason said its money market values remained stable.Regulatory officials have heightened their vigilance of the funds in recent weeks.On Wednesday the SEC told investment managers that on-balance sheet accounting for supported money market funds was not required if the sponsoring financial institution did not absorb the majority of the expected future risk associated with the money market funds assets.However, SEC staff would expect adequate disclosure of the nature of the support provided.As a result of recent market events, it is possible that some money market funds could become exposed to declines in the creditworthiness of troubled assets, the SEC said. To protect investors principal investment in these funds, sponsoring financial institutions can provide various types of financial support.Only once before has a money market fund seen its net asset value fall below $1 a share. In early 1994 Community Bankers Mutual Fund was adversely affected by quick changes in interest rates.
