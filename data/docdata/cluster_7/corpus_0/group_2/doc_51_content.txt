The government's takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is a step in the right direction for the Grand Strand economy, area business leaders said, because it will help restore confidence in the financial markets and bring lower mortgage rates that could nudge people to buy real estate."It's just a good move," said Mark Branstrom, the region's senior vice president for Bank of America's mortgage division. "They did that in order to bring confidence back into the market - confidence to get the investor back in buying bonds that they don't have to worry about them possibly buying something that's going to be worthless."At Crescent Bank, phone calls had already started rolling in Monday as people tried to find out how the takeover would affect them and whether mortgage rates had fallen.
