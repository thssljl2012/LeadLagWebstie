For about a year, we have been predicting an overall banking loss of $3 trillion on the housing market (30% of $10 trillion in mortgages). This number has been sliced and diced since (costs beyond the reduction in home value, actually initial number was $12 trillion, etc.), but the $3 trillion number still makes sense to me.Lets look at the checkbook so far:Paulsons newest plan to buy up bad debt is $1 trillion; plusA (stated) price tag for Freddie-Fannie of $200 billion; plus$85 billion for AIG; plus 80% of AIGs insurance exposure; plus$120 billion in freshly minted cash; plusAll the previous freshly minted cash ($300 billion?); plusGod knows what elseSo the checkbook says $1.7 trillion plus AIG insurance exposure plus the real Freddie-Fannie exposure plus whatever else. Brick Oven sticks with the $3 trillion estimate. Perhaps the future history books will be truthful and we can honestly assess our estimates.
