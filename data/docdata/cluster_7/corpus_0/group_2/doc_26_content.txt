Posted by Eric Savitz barrons.com The underwriters for GT Solars (SOLR) IPO cleared the post offering quiet period this morning, freeing their analysts to launch research coverage. And the provider of solar cell manufacturing equipment is getting only mixed reviews, putting more pressure on an already struggling stock.     * Satya Kumar, Credit Suisse: Launched with Neutral rating and $14.50 target. The rating is primarily a reflection of valuation, he writes, but it also balances the upside volume potential for solar equipment capex as solar approaches grid parity and the downside potential from Asian competition. He foresees EPS for the March 2009 fiscal year of 74 cents; for FY 2010, hes at $1.12.     * Krish Sankar, Bank of America: Launched with Neutral rating and $16 target. We are optimistic on the overall potential of the company; but with no significant new polysilicon opportunity we dont see meaningful upside from current levels, he writes. Sankar sees profits of 76 cents this year, $1.23 next year.     * Stephen Chin, UBS: Launches with Buy rating and $19 target. We believe GY Solar will emerge as the solar industrys leading equipment supplier of furnaces and polysilicon reactors, he writes. We estimate this will represent 70% of capex by crystalline-based solar customers. Chin says the company is nearing customer wins from Q-cells, Reliance Industries and Samsung Petrochemical that could add $500 million to backlog. He sees EPS of 75 cents this year, $1.25 next year.     * Jeff Osborne, Thomas Weisel Partners: Launches with Overweight rating, $18 target. He says the stock deserves to trade at 18x-20x EPS, given the 47% growth expected in EPS in calendar 2009. His estimates: 72 cents this year, $1.14 next year. GT Solar, which went public in late July at $16.50 a share, today is down 64 cents, or 5.1%, to $11.96.
