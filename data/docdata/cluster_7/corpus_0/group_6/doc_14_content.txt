The dramatic collapse of the housing market - which is predicted to suffer a crash in prices of up to 20% this year - will blow an unexpected 15bn "black hole" in the public finances, economists have warned.The loss to the Treasury will come partly as a result of sharply falling receipts from stamp duty and capital gains tax on sales of second homes, as prices collapse and transactions fall in a market entering a state of virtual seizure.Offering some good news to homeowners among the gloom, revenues will also be hit by a sharp decline in inheritance tax receipts as tens of thousands of families escape the "death duty" trap as their homes plummet in value, taking their assets below the threshold at which the 40% tax becomes payable.Economists and politicians said last night that the heavy losses to the Treasury could "roll on" for years, as the property market was unlikely to bounce back to 2007 levels in the short term.The 15bn property tax black hole is just one key element of a fiscal disaster facing the chancellor, Alistair Darling, as it becomes clear that the economic crisis will be far more serious than predictions in his pre-budget report (PBR) suggested last November. Then, the Treasury estimated that property prices would "fall by 20% in the two years to the end of 2009". The PBR predicted that, as a result, 7bn would be lost to the Treasury in 2009-10, compared with figures in the 2008 budget.But after house prices crashed 18.9% last year alone, according to the Halifax - and amid predictions of an even sharper drop this year - the loss of revenue in 2009-10 is expected to at least double to nearer 15bn. Michael Saunders, chief economist at Citibank, said that he expected prices to fall by a further 15% to 20% this year alone.Seema Shah, an economist at Capital Economics, said: "We are expecting things to be even worse."Saunders said the loss of property tax revenue would probably contribute to an overall surge in government borrowing this year to between 130bn and 140bn, compared with the estimate of 118bn given in the pre-budget report. The fall in prices, and drop-off in transactions, is mainly hitting Treasury revenue from stamp duty, which is paid as a proportion of the sale price.In the 2007-08 financial year, stamp duty on all kinds of property transactions raised 14.1bn. Cautious estimates put out by the Treasury say it will fall this financial year by 5.8bn. The Treasury will also lose out as families reap the benefit from the fall in the value of their homes by escaping inheritance tax, payable this year at a rate of 40% on assets worth 312,000 for a single person or 624,000 for couples. Gordon Brown decided in the autumn of 2007 to raise the threshold in stages, from 300,000 to 350,000 in 2010, and to allow couples to combine their allowances, after the Tories announced that they were proposing to increase the threshold to 1m.Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats' treasury spokesman said that the government had not only failed to see the crash coming, but had got into a "foolish bidding war" with the Tories over inheritance tax "which will now leave the Treasury with far less in tax than they should have had".Darling will have to present a full set of updated economic forecasts in his spring budget. After a flood of dire news since the autumn, most analysts expect him to be forced to acknowledge that the recession will be deeper, and longer, than he had previously predicted.Economic policyRecessionguardian.co.uk &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009   Use of this content is subject to our Terms &amp; Conditions   More Feeds
