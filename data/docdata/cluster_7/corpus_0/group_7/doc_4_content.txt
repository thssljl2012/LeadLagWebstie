The Federal Reserve today extended for six months emergency funding programs meant to ease the credit crunch. Its programs, which will end Oct. 30, are designed to support short-term lending to businesses as well as loans to consumers such as auto loans, student loans and credit card debt. The Fed also seeks to protect investors in money market funds. Apparently, the Fed fears the credit crisis will continue through much of this year.
