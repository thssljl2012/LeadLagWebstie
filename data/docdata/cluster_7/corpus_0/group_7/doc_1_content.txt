The jobs statistics indicate that more than a million people are likely to be out of work in Australia by next year. The latest ANZ bank jobs ads series showed that the number of advertised positions dropped 6.3 per cent in January. After nine consecutive months of decline, the number of ads has fallen 34 percent in the past year. Economists regard these results as an early warning--about six months ahead--of the actual decline in employment ahead.
