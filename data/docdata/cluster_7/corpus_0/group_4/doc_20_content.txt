Australia trims rates by three-quarters point.SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australia's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate Tuesday by a bigger-than-expected three-quarters of a percentage point as the global financial meltdown threatens to drag the country into recession.It was the third time in as many months that the Reserve Bank of Australia slashed rates, and takes the cash rate to 5.25 percent.Analysts had widely expected the bank to cut rates as the next step in a series of aggressive moves by policymakers to protect the Australian economy from recent market turmoil, but most thought the amount would be half a point."International economic data have continued to point to significant weakness in the major industrial economies, and there have been further signs that China and other parts of the developing world are slowing as well," bank Gov. Glenn Stevens said in a statement.The earlier rate cuts, a plunge in the Australian dollar and an AU$10.4 billion ($6.9 billion) stimulus package announced by the government last month would help growth, Stevens said."But deteriorating international conditions and falling commodity prices will have a dampening influence" and cause weaker-than-expected economic activity, he said.The Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country's largest bank, immediately announced it would cut mortgage lending rates by half of the central bank's reduction. Other banks said they were reviewing their mortgage rates.Treasurer Wayne Swan urged the banks to pass on the rate cut in full to borrowers to protect the economy from the worldwide downturn."This is the additional rate relief that Australian families and businesses need in the face of the global financial crisis," he told reporters in Canberra. "It will strengthen our economy at a vital time."The rate cut, announced after the bank board's latest monthly meeting earlier Tuesday, came one day after a string of data reinforced fears Australia's economy is slowing quickly.The data showed house prices rising at their slowest pace in almost three years, sliding retail sales and a sixth consecutive month of falling job advertisements.Meanwhile, inflation last month climbed to 5 percent, its highest level in more than a decade.Stevens said the downturn was likely to cause inflation to ease soon.RBC Capital Markets senior economist Su-Lin Ong said Tuesday's rate cut reflected the central bank's growing concern the global downturn was spreading and slow the mining boom that has underpinned Australia's economic growth for more than a decade."Increasingly they are pointing to China and Asia in the moderation that is occurring there," Ong said of the bank's board. "While this started in the U.S., it has broadened across the globe and it has clear implications for commodity prices in Australia."The bank was moving quickly "to really prevent Australia from tipping into a recession, which seems to be gripping much of the developed world and threatening parts of the developing world," Ong said.
