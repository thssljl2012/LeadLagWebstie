Macquarie Group, Australia&amp;#8217;s biggest investment bank, became the latest lender to announce a sharp fall in profits, but relief as it said it would not tap investors for more cash sent its shares soaring.  While most banks in the region avoided the initial impact of the crisis caused by the U.S. subprime mortgage meltdown, subsequent shockwaves shutting off access to credit, hitting asset values and punishing equity markets have taken a toll. Shareholders have seen their investments plummet, governments have had to step in to offer support and employees are now increasingly in the firing line, with Citigroup overnight announcing plans to cut 52,000 jobs globally.  HSBC added to the employment gloom on Tuesday, saying it would cut a further 500 staff in Asia, mostly in Hong Kong, due to deteriorating economic conditions and caution about next year.  The crisis has also shaken up bank ownership around the world, with Bank of America Corp on Monday taking the opportunity to increase its stake in China Construction Bank Corp.
