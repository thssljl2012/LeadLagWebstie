Know how gas has nearly tripled in price at the pump under Bush? Guess what happens when Iran and its newfound buddy Russia shut off the Straits of Hormuz. That's right, kiddies: $20 a gallon gas is staring us in the face.   In fact, the price of gas worldwide will skyrocket, causing a global depression that will rival if not exceed the infamous worldwide depression of the 1930s in terms of pain inflicted.  That, and the murder of tens of thousands of Iranians -- and the endangerment of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. What's more, the Iranians know full well what he intends to do, at the behest of the neocon/Likudnik/Kadimaite military-industrial complex, and are preparing for it.  -- The &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;London Times&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; reports that &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article4232021.ece&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Iran is targeting its Shahab-3B missiles&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, which have a range of 1,250 miles, to take out the nuclear warheads Israel says it doesn't have but which are the worst-kept secret in arms control. -- Say bye-bye to the Straits of Hormuz, say hello to $20-a-gallon gas:  &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=26653&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Iran will shut down the Straits at the first sign of an attack&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. -- Just in case anyone thought that Iran wasn't serious about defending itself:  &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-06/30/content_8459225.htm&amp;quot;&amp;gt;320,000 mass graves are being pre-dug in border provinces to handle what the Iranians expect to be a full land assault on their country&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;. Call your congresscritters now. Tell them that you won't stand for this nonsense.

This is something Stirling, Oldman and myself were discussing as far back as 2004. Simply put, oil is the &amp;quot;unit of ultimate scarcity&amp;quot; in modern economies because it's very hard to substitute away from it. Sure, you can try, with foolishness like corn ethanol, but we're seeing where that leads. Oil makes the modern suburban economy possible. It is deeply embedded in how we make food, so much so that decades ago the late author Robert A. Heinlein came to the conclusion that the limits on food growth were based on oil, and that food wouldn't become a problem till oil became scarce. He's looking rather prescient today. The suburban economy of the US, likewise, simply requires oil to run. Suburbs and exurbs require automobiles and automobiles require oil.At one time the dollar was backed by gold. What a lot of people failed to realize is that now the dollar has been backed by oil. Countries throughout the world wanted dollars, because dollars bought oil. As the dollar has been inflated by massive money printing, the price of oil has soared. This isn't the only cause of the increase in oil prices, but it is a significant reason. There is no reason for producers of a scarce, essential resource, to accept inflation unless you, well, have them over a barrel. For a long time the US did have them over a barreldollars, which were also the key currency for buying securities and various high tech devices, were more rare than oil was. Then Greenspan put the pedal to the metal. It is not a coincidence that oil prices begin to rise after Greenspan started providing huge liquidity hits in the late nineties.&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;Also, will somebody please explain to the gov't that &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/washington/25epa.html?partner=rssnyt&amp;amp;amp;emc=rss&amp;quot;&amp;gt;they are really not allowed to refuse to open emails when they are displeased with teh contents&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;: (via &amp;lt;lj user=&amp;quot;olympiasepiriot&amp;quot;&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;The White House in December refused to accept the &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/environmental_protection_agency/index.html?inline=nyt-org&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;More articles about the Environmental Protection Agency.&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Environmental Protection Agency&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;s conclusion that greenhouse gases are pollutants that must be controlled, telling agency officials that an e-mail message containing the document would not be opened, senior E.P.A. officials said last week.The document, which ended up in e-mail limbo, without official status, was the E.P.A.s answer to a 2007 &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/supreme_court/index.html?inline=nyt-org&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;More articles about the U.S. Supreme Court.&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Supreme Court&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; ruling that required it to determine whether greenhouse gases represent a danger to health or the environment, the officials said. This week, more than six months later, the E.P.A. is set to respond to that order by releasing a watered-down version of the original proposal that offers no conclusion. Instead, the document reviews the legal and economic issues presented by declaring greenhouse gases a pollutant. Over the past five days, the officials said, the White House successfully put pressure on the E.P.A. to eliminate large sections of the original analysis that supported regulation, including a finding that tough regulation of motor vehicle emissions could produce $500 billion to $2 trillion in economic benefits over the next 32 years. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter. Both documents, as prepared by the E.P.A., showed that the Clean Air Act can work for certain sectors of the economy, to reduce greenhouse gases, one of the senior E.P.A. officials said. Thats not what the administration wants to show. They want to show that the Clean Air Act cant work. &amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
