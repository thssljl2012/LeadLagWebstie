 There's a St George bank where Rockaway used to be.I'm tired of watching pieces of my city's soul disappear.  I feel like I'm watching every place I ever cultivated a memory get bastardised or razed.  I don't want Brisbane to be like any other city.  I want individuality, I want unpredictability.  I want eccentric millionaires to support small businesses.What's something that's disappeared from Brisbane that you miss?
