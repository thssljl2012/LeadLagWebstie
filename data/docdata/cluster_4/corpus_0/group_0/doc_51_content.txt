 In case you haven't heard, I'm running the Bank of America 26.2 mile marathon on October 12th. My brothers and I have decided to run for the Aids Foundation. Please support us by making a donation at Kane One Marathoners. Fund raising events are in the works. I'll keep you posted!Thank you.Best,Kane
