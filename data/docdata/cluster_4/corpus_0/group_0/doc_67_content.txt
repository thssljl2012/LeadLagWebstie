 Both of these are witnessed sucks that happened to my coworker Jean this week.1) Jean is putting away some hairbrushes in the middle aisle, I'm at the end of the aisle putting labels on stuff. There's a little boy, like 8, running around aimlessly while his grandma/caretaker/whatever is shopping. This happens fairly often and while annoying, usually the kids just mess with some stuff on the bottom shelves, so I wasn't worried. BUT...then the kid ran around the corner and balled up his fists and punched Jean in the gut.2) The Bank of America is in the same complex as we are, so once a day someone walks over there to make our deposit. Today Jean was walking back from the bank and I witnessed this exchange between her and a smoking man-Jean: Sir, did you know no one's supposed to smoke within 20 feet of a building's air intake?guy: Oh, you don't like it?            *blows large drag of cigarette smoke in Jean's face*She comes back in wheezing and immediately goes to the back for her inhaler. P.S. Jean works close to 50 hours a week, lost her sister to heart failure two weeks ago, and is very clearly over 70 years old.
