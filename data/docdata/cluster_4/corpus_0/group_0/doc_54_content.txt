 Last night I dreamed that Joker sent letters to only a few of his henchmen, addressed to "Robin Banks" (If you've seen the viral site, you'll most likely get the reference.)&amp;nbsp; Myself, my fiance', and my friend were the lucky few to receive the invitation.&amp;nbsp; We all met up at an old Bank of America building in Hickville, BFE.&amp;nbsp; Joker was helping us grab the loot before the police caught us, but we could hear the sirens coming and we all bailed.&amp;nbsp; Somehow I got left behind and Joker (strangely) tried to help me out of the bank house, but not before I handed him my loot.&amp;nbsp; It was such an old building that things were crumbling and for some reason all the doors were transforming into old rusty screen doors.&amp;nbsp; It was almost like the bank house was a mirage, and we were actually robbing some poor old woman's house.&amp;nbsp; I found it strange that the song "King of Pain" by Sting was echoing in the background throughout the entire dream.&amp;nbsp; I woke up several times singing the lyrics.  Here is some background found on the song, found at this link. This is a very personal song written by Sting. He had recently separated from his first wife and was not getting along with the other 2 members of the band. Sting wrote this in Jamaica at the house where Ian Flemming wrote the James Bond books. Sting: "I conjured up symbols of pain and related them to my soul. A black spot on the sun struck me as being a very painful image." This was a tough song to record. Sting didn't accept most of the suggestions from Andy Summers and Stuart Copeland. The Police recorded this on the Caribbean Island of Monserrat. There was a great deal of tension in the band, and this was their last album.
