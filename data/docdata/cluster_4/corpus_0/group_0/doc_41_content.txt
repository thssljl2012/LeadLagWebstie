  Busy week, really busy Thursday, and now it's time for the "week in review".... The week started off with a story about how Bank of America wants out of Concord, and their plans to sell their building for 200-million dollars.Other stories this week include....Changes coming to 2nd and Willow Pass Road.29 employees were laid off from the Contra Costa Times.The real theme of the Spaghetti has been revealed.Concord's under 8 are local division champs!Double stabbing at Newhall Park in Concord.Concord is giving raises to their management.And the water leak on Mira Vista and Willow Pass has been fixed.We had a few robberies this week. One in the Sunvalley Mall parking lot, one off Olivera, another near the very end of Clayton Road, and then two more!Also this week...."Shasta" took some great pictures of baby birds.Some guy in Antioch bit off his Brother-in-Law's eyebrow.We had an apartment fire in Concord, which is considered suspicious.Big 5's old building is a mess, and needs some cleaning up.The spirit poles made a comback on claycord.com.We gathered information for you on two council races, one in Concord, and the other in Clayton.We had a shooting in the "Fruit Bowl" neighborhood.Costco is expanding, and Oil Can Henry's is building a shop on Clayton Road.And the Concord City Council approved the new Rite-Aid store on Monument.We didn't really have a huge story of the week, but two got a little heated, they're the ones about the City of Clayton being taken off CNN's "best places to live" list, and the other was about disabled parking.We also started our weekly Thursday night chat on CLAYCORD.com. We had a lot of people join, and several different topics were discussed, some were serious, and some not. But overall, I think everybody had a good time. Thanks to those of you who logged into the chat room.The quote of the week comes from some random guy named Benjamin Disraeli....Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action.Thanks to every single one of you who helped out this week with tips, photos, suggestions, or emails just to say "Hi". If you've sent me an email and I haven't responded yet, just know that I've probably read it, and I plan to reply as soon as I get the chance. I appreciate all the e-mails I get, even the ones just to say you like the site.Thanks to "Radar" for another great week of pictures and reports. Also thanks to "Shasta" for her nice words to start off each day, and thanks to "Chaz" for all the work you did this week to get information and pictures.Have a nice weekend, and no matter what you do, do it safe, and wear sunscreen too. :)
