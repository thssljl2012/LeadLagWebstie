 Yet another bank will open in Columbia Heights.  Bank of America will replace Suntrust as the "official bank" of DCUSA.  No, it's not really the official bank of DCUSA, but BOA will have a prominent corner unit at the development.   Original plans for DCUSA included a Suntrust in the space below Best Buy.  That plan looks to be dead at this point.  However, standing at 14th and Irving NW, you can now walk to BB&amp;T, Signal, Lafayette, Bank of America, PNC, Citibank and Wachovia without breaking a sweat.  They're all within TWO BLOCKS of the intersection; seven banks!  Bank of America also has another branch three blocks away right here in Mount Pleasant.
