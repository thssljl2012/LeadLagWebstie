Hey guys! I am participating in the AIDS walk this weekend and I need people to sponsor me! Anythin you can do to help would be appreciated. Please visit my site and make a donation if you can. This will help a lot of people! Heaven forbid maybe even you someday! So, HELP ME AND MANY OTHERS OUT!!!!!!! And if you would like to join my team, you do not have to work for Bank of America to do so! Just let me know you want to walk with us and you are totally welcome!Tim ;-)http://aidswalksanfrancisco2008. kintera. org/timbilyeu
