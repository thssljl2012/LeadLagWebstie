 There is no doubt about the way iPhone and APPLE's app store is going to change the way mobile commerce is going to be in the near future.  I am always interested in seeing the big players make their moves in this new territory.  Starting with this thread, I will create a new series called 'mobile marketing showcase'.Bank of America is not holding back any, I saw a paid search ad (Content Targeting, actually) in my GMAIL inbox and it took me to this landing page.It is nice to see the aggressive move made by BoA to introduce their commitment in mobile banking.  I am not a BoA customer, but something like this can easily be viewed as a value add from a financial institution.the mobile experience  http://theMobileExperience.blogspot.com
