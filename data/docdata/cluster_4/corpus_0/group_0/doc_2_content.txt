The big question is what sets this area apart from the rest of the country?Lake Norman itself is a huge draw, both for people relocating directly to this area or one of the surrounding towns, and relocating to the greater Charlotte area. The lake offers relaxed and resort-like living in an area just a short drive from a major metropolitan city, with the commute so short that a large number of people live here and commute daily.Charlotte is a major banking center, with the corporate centers of two of the nations largest banks, Bank of America and Wachovia bank, in addition to several large regional banks and financial institutions. The city is home to Fortune 500 companies, has a growing and vibrant downtown area with an emphasis on the arts. The sports connection with the Panthers and Bobcats, along with NASCAR and the future NASCAR Hall of Fame give the area qualities sought by those relocating. Lake Norman has grown from primarily a second home community in the early 1970s, to a bedroom community of Charlotte later on, to the thriving community of today. The lake area no longer is simply for the homes of those who work in Charlotte, with tremendous growth of the towns surrounding the lake itself.Huntersville, Cornelius and Davidson have a business community that supports the residents, along with the shopping, restaurants and entertainment needed for families. Mooresville has grown at a phenomenal rate in the past 10-15 years, utilizing its name as Race City USA into a NASCAR team center with the support businesses as well.

Real estate in the Lake Norman area hasmolded and matured in this region since the early 70s. Lake Norman real estate began with mobile homes and cabins on waterfront lots with very little attention paid to properties off the water. The planned developments were few and far between, with the general consensus that the lake was for weekend or vacation homes and planning was not the norm. Through the years, with the infrastructure improvement beginning with Interstate 77 from Charlotte north being finished in the mid-70s, to general road improvement taking the many gravel roads to state-maintained paved roads and the four-lane Hwy. 16 for the west side, the real estate opportunities have improved and housing along with it. The lake area now boasts many communities planned for permanent residents with restrictive covenants to protect values, and architectural review plans for construction. Seven golf communities have been created in the general area with tennis and swim amenities, and clubhouse to attract families looking for activities and protection of their home values. Values have increased significantly due in part to the general maturing of the area, proximity to the Charlotte area and what it offers and the infrastructure built through the past 10-15 years. Lake Norman has become a destination point in itself with relocating families seeking it out from all areas of the country and abroad.
