                Author: Megan L. MahanYou've received an insurance lead, established contact and talked to the prospect about how your services can meet their needs. But how do you close the sale and gain a new client?Many agents are intimidated by the closing process because they don't want to spook the client and lose the sale. But by learning a few simple closing techniques, you'll be able to gauge where the client is in the buying process--and land yourself a new client.Laying the GroundworkWhen it comes to insurance sales, it's your job to determine the prospect's needs and help them understand how your services can meet those needs. By doing this, you create a foundation on which to build a trusting business relationship.A good sales foundation should:Get the prospect's attention Establish rapport with the prospect Result in an understanding of the prospect's concerns, needs and values Address how your services can meet the prospect's needsNot sure where to start? Ask the prospect some open-ended questions about what they need and want out of their coverage. Get the prospect talking and you can tailor your sales tactics accordingly. In return, you'll strike rapport with the prospect, leading to trust--a key component in closing a sale.Focusing on the ProspectWhen you focus on the prospect, you show them that you're committed to helping them find what they need, which inspires confidence and trust--significantly increasing the chances that the prospect will buy a policy from you.If you need help staying focused on the prospect (rather than the sale), you're not alone. Here are six tips to help you:Relax! Even if you're desperate for a sale, it's important to keep your emotions to yourself. Your stress will be evident to the prospect and weaken their trust in you. Get a little personal. Connecting with the prospect on a human level will help them to see you as a person rather than someone who's trying to sell them something. Use the prospect's name. Calling your prospect by his or her first name will help foster the relationship you need to close the sale. Maintain eye contact. Eye contact will let the customer know you're truly interested in helping them. Directly address the prospect's needs. Once you know what the prospect needs, tell them how your products can fill those needs--and refer back to them often. Listen up. Through even the simplest conversations, people reveal their needs, wants and motivations. Listen closely and adjust your sales techniques accordingly.When you focus on the prospect, you make it clear to them that they're important to you. And on top of the foundation you've previously created, this will increase the chances that your prospect will become a new client.The Art of Trial ClosingMany insurance agents still practice trial closing to see where the prospect is in the buying process. Trial closing questions will help you determine whether the prospect is resistant to buying a policy, on the fence, or ready to sign a policy.Not sure what questions to ask? You might want to try the following:&amp;quot;&amp;quot;How to do you feel about the information we've gone over?&amp;quot;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&amp;quot;What questions or concerns do you have?&amp;quot;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Do you see how this policy can meet your financial needs?&amp;quot;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Would you like more information about the policies we've talked about?&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Give these questions a try during your sales presentation to see if your prospect is ready to buy. If your questions are met with some resistance, simply readdress your prospect's needs and the ways in which your product can fulfill those needs.Closing the SaleSo you've set a solid foundation with the prospect, established casual, trusting rapport with them and have gotten some positive responses to your trail closing questions. And yet the prospect still seems to be on the fence. What now?Give a deadline. Some agents have found success by establishing a deadline, after which an offer will expire. And while you run the risk of losing the prospect, giving a deadline will help differentiate between clients who are truly interested in what you have to offer and those that will put you on hold for months.Discuss the consequences of fence-sitting. Ask the prospect what it would cost them not to buy a policy from you today. This might include the cost of an uninsured accident or the cost of buying a policy from someone else. Just make sure you approach the prospect with their best interests at heart so they don't feel bullied.Keep on top of the competition. When you know what your competitors offer and for how much, you can speak honestly about why your product is better or more affordable.The End ResultWhen it comes to closing techniques, remember that they're designed to get a decision out of the customer, and that decision may not always be in your favor. Nonetheless, losing a sale can be good for your business, too--allowing you to pursue other leads and practice your closing skills until they become second nature. Finding what works for you may take a little time, but it will be worth it as you watch the new insurance prospects convert to sales. _________________________________________________________________ _____About InsureMeInsureMe links agents nationwide with consumers shopping for insurance.
