 Headache last night turned into a migraine, worst one I've ever had. Couldn't get it to go away, I threw up a bunch of times (Mexican for dinner, ow, my throat's all torn up), and every little movement made me want to take a drill to my head. Absolutely miserable.Do not want to be awake and going to work. Also having issues with the study abroad office (I hate gw) and found out today that rent is due tomorrow (I'd thought it was early in the month, forgot it was the first), so have to do some juggling around of stuff so I have enough money to pay... Paycheck is later this week. Will not be doing much this week. =pApparently there is one Bank of America ATM in Boulder... have to try and find it so I can deposit checks I get until direct deposit kicks in, so I actually have money in my account.Ow, my throat.Off to work.
