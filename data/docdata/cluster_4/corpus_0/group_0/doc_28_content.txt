 Great weekend just gone by!Reaaaly cba to update bout it now so i'll do it like 2morrow or something.Thoughts of the day:I drink too muchI smoke too muchI eat the wrong foods in excessEarly grave? Possible.Should i stop? NO! XDWhy should I stop?Again with guy issues.People keep sayin "why didnt you pull at pride?" "go out and pull" etc etcI CANT PULL!Its a simple fact for me.If you arnt confident about everything about yourself, you cant expect to pull. And i'm no way confident about ANY bit of me, so pulling is an impossible feat which shall never be acomplished.That, plus im shy when trying to pull.&amp;nbsp;Nessie and aimee can confirm this! XD I leave rooms! its that bad!Anyways enuf ramblings.&amp;nbsp;Smoke then sleep i think!or a drink then an episode of family guy/the war at home.I duno.I'll do what comes first!
