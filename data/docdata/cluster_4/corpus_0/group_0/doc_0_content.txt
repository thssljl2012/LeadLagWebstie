  5 Locks 4 Miles. Now  moored above Potters lock. This morning I had to make another unexpected trip into  Ripley due to a Barclays bank money machine swallowing my debit card yesterday.  Just lucky we have the bus passes because that would have been another 4.40 for  the return journey.Old Nottingham Canal enters Northern Basin- now used for moorings Original Nottingham Canal Toll office When I spoke to the lady behind the glass screen at Barclays  I was asked if it was a Lloyds bank card to which I answered that it was. She  then told me that only Barclays bank cards are retained, any other cards are  automatically destroyed. Bloody marvellous, their machine caused the problem,  now I'm stuck with the problem of getting a new card. I was politely told where  I would find a Lloyds bank and to go and speak to them. I was not a happy  chappie.   Round the corner at Lloyds the staff were not at all fazed  about the situation and soon had another card ordered and a cash withdrawal  made. The only problem now is that the replacement will have to be sent to our  London address and then work out a way of getting it to us where ever we may  be.   Well that was the morning taken care of and we knew that  today's travel would only take a couple of hours so there was no problem on this  score. After the week-ends mediocre weather today is gloriously sunny and hot  but we still have that infernal wind although not as strong as it has been.  Along the way we couldn't help but notice how clear the water was and with the  sun shining down onto it we could see the fish as we went. There was a shoal of  large bream, a solitary carp. umpteen jack pike and many shoals of  roach.A couple of new bridges on the Erewash Canal(two years work according to the signs)         Just before we moored up we had to give the propeller a  reverse blast twice to clear away some debris, so after mooring up I went down  the weed hatch to see if anything was still attached to the prop shaft. I  finished up attacking it with a knife as there was rope, string, plastic,  fishing nylon and a couple of feet of heavy duty weed strimmer nylon. The  latter was about 2mm thick and no way would it break but I eventually succeeded  in clearing everything ready for tomorrow.  1326 locks, 1904  miles, 43 Tunnels, 42 swing bridges and 19 lift bridges since Nov  2006
