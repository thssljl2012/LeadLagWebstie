The Asheville Police Department did an excellent job of blocking access to the bank entrance and the ATM, scaring off a number of bank customers. Dressed in top hats, gowns, monocles and feather boas, these Billionaires for Coal staged a demonstration calling for increased coal development. They chanted Get your dirty mountains off our clean coal! and thanked B of A customers for their support.  Meanwhile, a group of counter-protesters handed out leaflets about the ecological and human-rights consequences of dirty energy investments and held banners decrying B of As support for mountain top removal mining. Some of the protesters apparently went inside the banks, raising a ruckus and handing out information until they were advised that the police were on their way.  Outside the bank - the motley crew of billionaires demonstrated in style, informing the public of BoAs dirty deeds. Several passers-by who stopped to talk said that they would cancel their B of A bank accounts. From Abigail in Asheville
