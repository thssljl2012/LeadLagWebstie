 and it wasn't St Nick....our new roof is done, courtesy of Nationwide Insurance :)Product arrival.....Product mess...included the shed.....WHERE are my nine laborers? During lunch, one was taking a siesta in Teris' hammock..The old roof prepares for a dump run...Nearing completion...David dreaming of stealing the turnip truck in the driveway....Nine 'laborers' got the job done in just a bit over one day of work, pretty amazing. Looking at the crew, I thought about placing a "U.S. Border Patrol-K9" cap on the dog, but thought against it thinking that would set back the project a few days...anyway, glad it's done--where else can you get a $7,000 home improvement for $250!
