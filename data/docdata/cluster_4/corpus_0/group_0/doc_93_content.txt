          Ok, Gordon and Deng are screwed, so Im waiting for Paxson to outbid himself any day now. Five years, $45 mil for Deng, three years $15 mil for Gordon.  Screw them if their agents havent figured out that non-star players get screwed under the new CBA.Dumars  is on the verge of blowing up the Pistons, he knows they cant compete with Boston and has to shake things up. The rumor that makes the most sense is trading Sheed. The Bratwurst has a trade  in mind If Hammond pulls off a big deal for a power player (such as the Rasheed Wallace-Desmond Mason, Charlie V and Bell trade Ive mentioned in the past) then it makes sense.Which would make Milwaukee a 3-5 seed in my mind. No way Dumars does that deal though. Feels like something is gonna happen with the Bucks, no way Skiles plays Villy and now they have a log jam at the point with Mo Williams, Lue and Sessions.Why dont the Bucks try to swap Mo Williams for Haslem?How about Hinrich for Haslem and then send Gooden to Milwaukee for Mason (expirer ) and a #1. The Bulls gain some cap space and add a solid 4 with a ring to the mix.If the Bulls start Hinrich at the 2 next year I going to be pissed. How many starting two guards in the league cant touch the rim? Another year of Hinrich being overmatched by guarding guys who have 3 inches and 40 pounds will be as fun as watching Obama punk McCain all summer and fall. Trade him!Riles has got to move Haslem for a pg soon. Hinrich, Wade, Beasley, Marion and a center to be named later is a pretty damn good antidote to what the Celtics got.p.s. Oh man, what a win by the Dawgs last nite. BenGo pitches a complete game and goes 6 for 6 at the plate.Me thinks we need a Cookout to celebrate.
