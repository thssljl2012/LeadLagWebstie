Close to 1500 staff from these banks have signed up to the Appeal for Justice which is also posted on www.finsec.org.nz Westpac Union Council Chair Maxine Mullen says that the advertisement has sent a loud and clear message to the banks that staff want fair pay, better staffing and to fix targets. Were also sending a message to bank customers that their concerns are our concerns. Quality service and ethical banking goes hand in hand with addressing pay, targets and staffing.  Maxine said that non-members could influence the outcome of the negotiations by joining our union before negotiations start. The more members we have, the stronger our position at negotiations. Already hundreds of new members have joined Finsec. We are stronger together.
