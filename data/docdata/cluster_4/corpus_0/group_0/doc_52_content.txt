 Mortgage crisis was resolved semi-satisfactorily: we were overdrawn for about half an hour between Nationwide's dd kicking in and my call to the ISA line. If Barclays charge me a fee and don't refund it (as I've been assured they should given last night's call and my otherwise clean record for 10+ years, yadda yadda) I will definitely tell them where to go and switch banks.Nationwide can't tell me yet whether the money will/has gone through for some reason, apparently all will become clear in a couple of days' time. If I incur a 27.50 charge from them, I'll trytrytry to get that back from Barclays too, though I don't fancy my chances.Southern Electric have finally done something about the crappy meter readings which resulted in our huge, inaccurate bill - a month after I reported the problem, and apparently only because I called rather than my fortnightly readings. Wankers. It'll take a while for the credit to show up, but at least the next bill should be smaller.. Wankers. I'd prefer a refund, not a bloody credit! But fixing the problem one way or another is better than nothing. They'll also convince Powergen to reissue their equally inaccurate bill, allegedly. So I'll still end up paying someone, somehow. Meh.In other news, I signed up to Macmillan Cancer Support's Opportunities Exchange a while ago. Today I got a call from their features/PR lady asking if a journo could interview me for either the Times (whee!) or the Sun (ugg). She apparently writes for both and wants to do a piece on young women with cancer. All very exciting! I've never been in a national paper before, but would prefer the Times, donchaknow.. :)
