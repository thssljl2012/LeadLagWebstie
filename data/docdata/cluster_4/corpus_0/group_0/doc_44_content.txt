 I found out that one can have a "My Expressions" debit card with Bank of America, and I knew that I had to have one! My new debit card will look like this: This is SO awesome! I can't wait for it to come in the mail... Z and I went to see Ricky Gervais at the Kodak Theatre last night.  It was the first time I've been inside the Kodak, and all I could think of going in was... 'is this really it?' Ahmed Ahmed opened for Ricky, lots of Arab jokes, promotion of his Axis of Evil tour, etc. Then Ricky came out, with fireworks and big giant sign that announced "RICKY".  The guy is hilarious.  If you can catch him when he tours, do so, the guy is nuts.
