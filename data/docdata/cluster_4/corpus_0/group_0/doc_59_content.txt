okay get this...i posted my terse message on BOA's philanthropy comments page and my response was "this is the philanthropy department. you need to contact the credit card department." EXACTLY MY POINT YOU MORON! Philanthropy means "The effort or inclination to increase the well-being of humankind, as by charitable aid or donations." which means you help someone out by some kind of aid...hmm contradiction because yall stole from me and my kids...how is that philanthropy?!?!?! anyway moron squared because i had already posted to the credit card department's comments page - so obviously these people don't talk &amp;nbsp;but here was their response... "since you did not log in we cannot give any information to you because you may be an unauthorized person trying to&amp;nbsp;make changes to&amp;nbsp;this account." WHAT THE HELL!?!?!? if i didn't log in then what account am i trying to make changes to?!?!?!? are you catching on? these people are dolts, morons, asses, complete tyrannical insane evil-ass scrubs who do not care anything about their customers. only that they make $$$$ which is strange because you'd think they'd want me to use the card so they can collect interest...oh well another piece of evidence showing they are stupid. extremely stupid. so again i recommend you close any and all bank of america accounts. they are not out to serve your best interest.
