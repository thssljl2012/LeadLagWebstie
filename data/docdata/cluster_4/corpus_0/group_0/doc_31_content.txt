nationwide health insurance.&amp;nbsp; all done. check please. think about it...the car companies in other countries (toyota, nissan, audi, etc) all have nationwide health insurance/coverage.&amp;nbsp; that means toyota, nissan, et al don't have that overhead digging into their profits like we (the US) do.&amp;nbsp; so THEY can remain competitive and offer decently priced cars.&amp;nbsp; THEY also don't have their workforce striking, slowing down production because the Union can't accept what the "Man" is offering.&amp;nbsp; If we (the US) could have a nationwide health plan, much like what the military has, we could remain competitive, too.  it seems simple enough to me and i'm a slightly&amp;nbsp;uneducated homemaker with half my GI tract missing.&amp;nbsp;  what do you think?? moral of the story - i really enjoy having late suppers.&amp;nbsp; no, that has nothing to do with nothing, but it is almost 7p and i&amp;nbsp; haven't made supper yet.&amp;nbsp; but i'm gonna do that right now!!&amp;nbsp;
