What is it that makes creditors so heedless of a federal court injunction? I have clients complaining of staid banks like Bank of America calling multiple times a day after they got notice of the bankruptcy; Chase trying to foreclose on a client&amp;#8217;s house despite the automatic stay; the State of California levying against a Chapter 13 debtor for the second time in two years, well after the bankruptcy case was filed. Is it desperation on the part of creditors? A general disdain for the law?  Budgets that don&amp;#8217;t permit training of staff? I don&amp;#8217;t know, but my mission is to make this scofflaw attitude costly for creditors. Debtors are entitled to a respite from collection efforts. It&amp;#8217;s about time creditors got the message.
