Northern Rock, the nationalised mortgage lender, has hired the vice-chairman of Barclays bank to take over as chief executive on a package worth pounds 2.6m plus bonuses over the next two years, making him the country's best paid civil servant.  Gary Hoffman, 48, who joined Barclays 26 years ago and was made vice-chairman in July 2006, will replace Andy Kuipers from October 1. Mr Kuipers, one of the few Northern Rock executives to have remained with the bank under public ownership, will leave the company.  The appointment of a permanent chief executive will also allow executive chairman Ron Sandler to step down to non-executive chairman, as planned when he was parachuted into the bank by the Treasury in February.  Mr Hoffman's remuneration package will see him leapfrog Mr Sandler as Britain's best paid civil servant. He will earn a base salary of 700,000, before bonuses, and receive three special 400,000 payments, the first on joining and the following two on successive years, as compensation for forfeiting Barclays' long-term incentive scheme.  The package tops the fixed 90,000 a month Mr Sandler was being paid as executive chairman. By comparison, Mr Hoffman received a base salary of 625,000 at Barclays and former Northern Rock chief executive Adam Applegarth was paid a base salary of 723,000 in 2007.  Mr Hoffman will continue to hold 431,761 Barclays shares worth 1.5m at yesterday's prices and retain a 2.6m pension pot that will pay an annual pension of 253,000 when he hits 60.  Mr Hoffman's main job will be to carry out Mr Sandler's strategy of halving Northern Rock's 100bn mortgage book, repaying the 25bn Bank of England loan by 2010 and releasing the Government from its 75bn of guarantees the following year. He will also have the uncomfortable task of making a third of the 6,000-strong workforce redundant. His bonus will be calculated against how rapidly the Government is released from its obligations.  Concerns were raised about the size of the pay deal. Matthew Sinclair, policy analyst at the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: &amp;quot;This is an extremely generous pay deal. It looks worryingly like the Government has used large amounts of taxpayers' money to tempt Mr Hoffman into a job that no one else would touch with a bargepole.''   Mr Sandler said: &amp;quot;I am delighted that Gary will join the board as chief executive. His skills, experience and overall track record make him an outstanding candidate for the role.''
