While having to get a loan for this kitchen remodel I assumed I would have no problem getting a line of credit. I have great credit, very low debt and make a decent salary. I guess I assumed wrong.   The other week Monkey &amp;amp; I head off to my bank. (Hmmm.. Do I name them? of course - Bank of America) I've been banking with them for a long time. 10+ years or more. The loan rep asked me two things. What's the house worth and how much do I owe on the loan? Sorry we can't help you. You only qualify for 20K and our line of credit loansstart at 25K.Wow.. Gee.. let's not look at how much money you make, your debt to income ratio nothing. Nada.   Off to bank number 2 - Columbia Bank. We talk to the rep there. Asks us why we're there etc. Wow.. This is unheard of - customer service. He too asks what's the house worth &amp;amp; how much is due on the loan. But also says that this is just a starting point. Again, we haven't looked at actual numbers. I have to say I was really impressed with the service. Their line of credits - start at 5K. Cool. I get a loan application and we walk away thinkingwe should get most of the funds we need.   We decide that I'll just go ahead and fill out this application and not have both of us on the loan. I fill the application out and Monkey dropped it off the otherweek. I got a call a day later confirming how much I wanted. I gave the gal a range on the phone, being a little leary with banks at that point.   Anyway.. Yesterday the guy we spoke to the other week said the loan was approved for the full amount. Yeah... I sign papers tomorrow and have decided to switch over all of my accounts over to them. I'd rather work with a smaller institution instead of a corporation like BOA.
