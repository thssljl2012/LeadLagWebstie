I am contemplating what I'll do with AALLL (muhahaha) my money when I get that job i'm interviewing for Monday (positive thinking NEVER hurts).  I signed up for an account at Westpac, but I'm unsure if I want to stay there.  Initially, I wanted to bank with them because of their agreement with the Bank of America--I don't have to pay fees for money taken out of the ATM from my BoA checking account.  However, the agreement doesn't really help me when getting an account with them.  Tasha did a GREAT overview of the banks in NZ the other day, and it came just in time.  I think I'm going to go with Kiwibank, and sign up for their 'FreeUp' account (no fees), and then start a savings account with them (an 'on call' account here).  Their interest rates are 8.3%, with a 0.5% 'bonus' tacked onto the rate if you don't make a withdrawal.  Now that's what I'm talking about--encouraging and motivating people to NOT spend money, instead of in the US, where they seem to love making it easier to spend.I was also wondering about NZ banks and if they have something similar to the FDIC insurance like in the US.  Turns out, they DO NOT, but the government is supposed to bail them out if something happens.  I will keep most of my savings in US currency for now as a cushion in case I need to go back, or in case NZ banks fail somehow.
