 TITLE: Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows.AUTHOR: metalsgoddessRATING: RWARNING: Man-Love, MEHGA A/U (as in I might even make a whole series concerning this relationship) AND ITS SO GODDAMNED CHEESEY. (Not that kind of cheese)P.O.V: Our dear Frankies, and probably will be in this whole series.SUMMARY: Set during and after The Black Parade is dead Frank is reflecting on his and Gerards relationship during the journey of The Black Parade, and how Gerard makes his life complete at the very end of it all. =P AND BOB OWNS A WHITE CAT CALLED SHADOW WHO IS PLOTTING THE WORLDS DEMISE! DISCLAIMER: Sadly, I dont own any of them, if I did, then this would of happened. ALTHOUGH, I do own Shadow Hes&amp;nbsp; my creation, and he is very cute. WORD COUNT: 702A/N: Was written on Sunday whilst at my Dads, typed up on Sunday then I broke the Internet and have only just been able to get online. Sorry, if its crap I was running SERIOUSLY low on energy drinks. And now I have like 27 cans of the stuff Ive looked it over and cba to change anything L. Un-betad. But all in all an alright read.&amp;nbsp;Ray started the Riff for Teenagers and I glanced over at Gerard as he conversed with the Audience.&amp;nbsp; Alright Mexico! You can shake it, right here... He started bobbing his hips, I felt a twinge in between my legs; and nobody wants you but me! he took a glance in my direction, seriously, if he does that again, my cock will explode and Ill come in my pants. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This relationship wasnt exactly sunshine and lollipops; it was a rushed night, resulting in us ending up in bed together and waking up in the morning thoroughly confused at why the hell we were in bed together. Same thing happened that night and instead of Blind Fucking as Bob calls it, Gerard had made love to me and this a relationship was formed which made the public kisses and touches just in case I didnt mind, it just meant I got extra at nights and then it was perfect. The perfect relationship for the most imperfect couple, well, until Projekt Revolution, that was cool, the kiss and everything, but, Gerard had met Lyn-Z, the bassist for MSI, she was nice but she tried to steal MY Gerard away from me, and it almost worked, if it werent for Bob, Ray, Mikey, Alicia and Bobs talking cat Shadow (which is trying to take over the world with the Chinese and Tescos. Im sure of it) to talk to Gerard to make him see what is was doing to me, I wouldnt be with him today and we wouldnt be celebrating our year anniversary tonight after the show. Gerard said we would come out to the Public soon enough, Whenever that is I was pulled out of my trance by Gerard singing the last part of Famous Last Words and saying his thank yous to the crowd. Mexico, One last thing before we leave I frowned and looked over at Gerard then back at the others to see if they were confused, they all had grins on their faces which showed they were probably all in on this, I looked back at Gerard who was now standing in front of me,&amp;nbsp; I jumped back slightly surprised, he took off my guitar and handed it to Ray who took it and handed it to one of the Guitar Techs, he held me in place by my waist, the Crowd went wild..Today is a very special day for Frank and I I was stunned, surely he wouldnt Would he? As it is a year today, that me and Frank got together as an official couple, and we have kept it secret all this time The crowd cheered again. and I think its time for a change He pecked me on the lips, then he got down on one knee and pulled out a velvet box. My mouth dropped open. Franklin Anthony Iero the crowd cheered more. I love you more than life itself and I want to spend the rest of my Pathetic existence with you he opened the blue box, inside were two gold engagement rings, one was encrusted with silvery jewels. So, will you do me the greatest honour, and, in witness to all these people, consent to be my Husband for as long as we both shall live? I grinned and nodded letting tears fall down my cheeks freely. He put the ring with the jewels in, on my ring finger and kissed my hand then stood up and kissed me full on the lips. I took the remaining ring and placed it on his slender finger.&amp;nbsp; I threw my arms around his neck and hugged him tightly, he put his arms around my waist and hugged me back. The crowd cheered even louder still, we broke apart and Mikey came over and hugged me, as Ray and Bob came over and congratulated us both, He turned to the audience, microphone in hand and said;Thank you Mexico! And goodnight! Gerard put an arm around my shoulders and led me off the stage to the many congratulatory cheers of the Roadies and Crew. Gerard turned to me and held me in place.Frank?Yeah?Happy anniversary I grinnedHappy anniversary to you too Gerard&amp;nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'Nuva Author's Note: I started writing a fic,after I was prompted, and I only got the first part done, I've started on the second, i'll try and get it done today, and I'll post the first part later.
