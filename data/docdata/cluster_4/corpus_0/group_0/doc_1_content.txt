 I freaked out the teller at M&amp;T Bank a couple of days ago while making a deposit. I made the deposit and she, as is usual, said, "Is there anything else I can do for you today?""Truthfully?" I said. "Yea. You can open up a branch office in Somerville, MA next month."I got this "deer in headlights" look.  :-)===But the reality of the situation is that I have change banks. Actually, I have to "add banks," since if the mortgage works out as it better work out, I'll be keeping it at M&amp;T bank and should be able to deal with it there.So, I wanted to get your opinions of the following banks, if you have them. Specifically, I'm not only looking at how they are banking-wise, but how they work via electronic access via Quicken.My finalists at this point are: Bank of America Citizens Bank Sovereign BankAny thoughts?
