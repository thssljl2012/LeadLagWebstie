Soo relieved it's finally over.&amp;nbsp; All the waiting around, secrecy, games of tetris and trivial persuit for two weeks.&amp;nbsp; I have mixed feelings really.&amp;nbsp; It's a very strange thing when you get laid off.&amp;nbsp; You're sad because the people you have been working closely with for the past couple of years just won't be around anymore and then you're happy, depending on the situation, because you basically are being put out of your misery.&amp;nbsp; I'm very fortunate to have put myself in a position where I have another job and money won't be an issue, mostly due to a very comfortable severance package : )&amp;nbsp; I'm sad to see it go though.&amp;nbsp; Countrywide has gotten some awful press recently and not so recently, but it was a great run.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully the mortgage industry will pick back up in a few years.&amp;nbsp; I will miss it : (&amp;nbsp; We all knew it was coming, just didn't know when.&amp;nbsp; I'm angry with Countrywide due to the way they handled things.&amp;nbsp; I'm certainly not going to parade around with my "Protect our House" braclet on, but I'm proud of what I learned while I was there.&amp;nbsp; So long Countrywide, or should I say Bank of America?&amp;nbsp; Time to move on...
