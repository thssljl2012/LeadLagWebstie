 Post 1   Post 2   Post 3Yesterday I got a letter from my bank with a copy of the tax check in it. First off, I did indeed make it out the US Treasury. Second, it was cashed on March 31st. Third, it was cashed in the correct town at... Bank of America? WTF? At this point BoA better hope that the IRS has an account with them or they are going to be explaining to Uncle Sam why they cashed a check made out to the US Treasury for someone else. I should call the IRS tonight, but my brain is fried. It'll have to be Monday. Still at least now I have routing information from when the check was cashed (although I can't read the endorsement on the back because its a stamp and the copy I have is piss poor). I'm going to give that to the IRS and see what they have to say.At this rate, I'll get my extra $30 back in about six months. -_-
