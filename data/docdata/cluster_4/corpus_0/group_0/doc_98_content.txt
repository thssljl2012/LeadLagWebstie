 IndyMac Bancorp Seized by Federal Regulators After Failing to Raise CashAs you know, I started around January or February moving my accounts around, I don't trust ANYBODY! I now have my IRA accounts in four different accounts, Fidelity, Vanguard, Tradestation and Interactive Brokers, and I have moved my bank accounts into seperate accounts, to keep it under the FDIC limits. It is just incredible to me, that over 10,000 people had over $100K in that outfit, that's just pure stupidity (I thought you got nothing back, but the article said the FDIC may be able to give them 50 cents on the dollar), at this point, no, none, zero medium or small banks, with even a hint of exposure to Alt-A, or especially, subprime loans, is safe, there should be no reason whatsoever to have any money at all in them. I would imagine that Bank of America "may" be fairly safe, JP Morgan, maybe even Wells Fargo, you notice I didn't mention Citigroup, or Citicorp, Etc etc etc. The bank accounts are very easy to do, but most people, especially us boomers, have most of our money in our IRA's, I know it's a pain in the ass, but I would highly recommend you scatter it around.Protect your self!!!!PS: Just a little stupid ranting note here, as you know, I was, eeeeerrrrr, still, a general contractor, going on 35 years now, and even after going through three prior recessions, the one in 89' (I don't care when the "official" one was) totally caught me by surprise, as the housing industry just litterally stopped dead in it's tracks, in a matter of about two months, and I honestly didn't see a pick up until about 96'. I was doing mostly government green sheet work, so it didn't affect me all that much, but I have to say, that one was a pin prick on a gnat's ass compared to what's been going on now. The thing about housing, is that people have a tendency to hang on, hoping and praying they can get through it, the wave of forclosures coming right now, is just the start, as these are mostly the speculator's that drove prices out of reach of the average American (IE, read, "Wall Street"), the one's that are trapped are the normal people that got caught up in the hoopla, and felt they had to buy that house they couldn't afford, before it got more unaffordable. A classic example, is just before I left SoCal forever, in Ontario, CA., on Fourth Street, next to the 10 Freeway, they had a bunch of these post world war II cracker boxes that the government built for the Vets coming home, I mean, they are like less than 900 square foot, on like 1/16th of an acre lots, and when I left, they were asking like $250K for these things, I mean, just totally unstinking fricking beliveable!!!That's neither here nor there, I mean, with housing in PrunePickerVille still averaging close to $400K, I could easily see it having to come down another 50% to even get close to reaching a bottom. I seriously doubt that the government is going to allow that to happen, which is going to mean subsidy on top of subsidy, coming out of our tax payer money, with most of that going to the Street, rather than where it is needed. They will try to some how freeze housing prices at these levels, which of course will just kill the market, as no body who is left will be able to afford them. But one of the worst things is yet to come, and I don't hear much talk about it, and that is the number of boomers who used the unprecedented jack up in appreciations, to re-fi their homes. Now get this, here's these people that were paying on their home for probably 20 years, and all of a sudden, find themselves sitting on a gold mine, with the chance to finally "afford" those things they couldn't afford before, like $30K fricking cars, $6000 big screen Tv's, blah blah blah, you know, JUNK, paying like less than a grand on their current mortgage, and now they have a $2500-3000 monthly payment, heading into their retirement years, and it was all based on the "bet" that they would be able to unload the albatross on their kids, so they could move into Nancy and Arnie's retirement paradise in Florida, when they shut it down.I mean, this is just my personal opinion of course, but I think we have years and years to go, to work this thing out. It should be interesting.
