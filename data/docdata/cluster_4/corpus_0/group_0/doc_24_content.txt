 Bank of America teamed up with the NY Yankees and Major League Baseball for a midsummer promotion. To attract new clients with a sports-friendly partnership, the bank handed out brochures and base-shaped logoed key chains during the All-Star Game Parade. Not only is the promotional key chain an incentive, but it presents added value to the brochure and makes it more memorable. It also complements the baseball theme that can be customized when you open a checking account. The offer features your favorite MLB baseball team logo on your checks and credit card to match. As this creative concept generates new clients and business for the bank, the keychain extends the longevity of the promotion when the client uses it in everyday life to gain even more exposure for the brand.
