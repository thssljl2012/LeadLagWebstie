 .... when no one is lookingWho are they trying to keep in or out at University Hall Makerere with razor wire? Are the students wont to scale the walls (and roof) or have thieves become a problem? Talk about biting off more than you can chew. Right in the middle of traffic on jinja road, the matresses started 'pouring' off the boda bike. I don't know how long it took to pick up all the pieces.A dead marabou stork lies uninterred at the foot of a signpost on the traffic island just opposite the Lugogo Mall pedestrian entrance.Went back to check out the progress of disintegration two weeks later. Only the beak (triangular things in the right foreground) a few bones and feathers were left. Nature is really thorough. Makes you think about how much space would be saved if we stopped building 6 feet by 2 concrete houses underground for every dead being.  This picture is not that good. I was looking at the rooftop of the Madhvani buildings opposite Barclays Jinja road. There were some places CHOGM did not kiss. P.S: I'm still waiting for someone to review Prof.Dr.VicePresident (house-like-a-hotel, now-Hotel-like-a-housing-block) Upland Rice (when does he do vice-presidenting?) champion's book. Gilbert Bukenya recently launched ( that word bores me) Through Intricate Corridors to Power (what kind of an overbearing luggage of an insufferably long and terribly worded title is that?). Has any one read? Please I am dying to know if a Ugandan politician can really write an autobiography or it's another altobiography ( hastily made up term for altered bio). I am not eager to read the late Noble Mayombo's 'An Officer and a Gentleman' though. P.P.S: I will be out for about a month while I do this annual leave thing. Enjoy your good and funny selves.
