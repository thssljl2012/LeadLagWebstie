 Labour are in freefall. You don't need to be a political junkie to see this.Just look at the Standard - actually don't waste your time. I can sum up their week in a few sentances:Monday - John Key spends too long away from Parliament eating babies/spending time with his family. Childless Clark is heralded as the greatest hard working PM of al eternity. Ban all readers who disagree.Tuesday - The Maori Party are all sexual deviants and wife bashers**, after all why else would they not choose Labour as a preferred party? Ban all readers who disagree.Wednesday - An independent bank (ANZ National) suggests that the Government has drastically increased their "back room spending" away from necessary front line spending. The Standard ridicule the bank and call them all National supporters... this continues to presume they are National friendly, right down to their rather "National sounding name" I wonder from where and by who did the image come from?By the way if a major bank said Labour were doing the right thing, Tane/Neale Jones would be crowing from the rooftops about Labours brilliance.Robinsod/Mike Porton adds his smarmy comments while others get banned.Thursday - add latest conspiracy theory and associate it with John Key. Nobody cares... people get banned for manking any comment. National Radio also publicises findings that the proposed Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) has flaws... immediately the Standard calls it Radio National.... sad little buggers.Friday - The Standard closes up shop. The New Zealand Bloggers Union doesn't sympathise :)Now seriously... how twisted are these people? We know who most of their authors are now - who all hold reasonably well paid state funded jobs  (or by workers who don't know their union levies are funding them), so if they think things are this rosy then they are going to be shitting blood on Election Day.** Yes they really said this.
