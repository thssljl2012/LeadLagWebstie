 Bad news: While traveling through Utah (Salt Lake City to be exact) we drove through some construction. A rock or some other kind of hard, flying object hit our windshield. The result was a chip the size of a dime with a tiny bit of spider webbing from it on the upper passenger side corner. This morning Alan walked the dog and saw that on of the threads of the 'spider web' had spread. Now there is a big line stretching across the passenger side. Yuck. So I called the insurance company and made a claim. Good news: Only $100 deductable to pay there and the windshield replacers are coming to us. Bad news: I tried to update my policy to Chicago since I figured it would be cheaper to have an Illinois policy over a California policy. However, AIG and my insurance company merge and they are only accepting new claims in Kentucky. So now I have to shop for new car insurance. Blah!Good news: The VA called today and I start working on Monday! Yippee!! A real paycheck. Totally awesome.
