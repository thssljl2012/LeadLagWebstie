 Last entry is officially a lie. I cba to post my African adventure. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I've done and am doing many things. Graduation, driving, jobs, to hit the big three. I also saw seals and penguins. I've applied to a few banks and with driving my problem is turning round corners I think. I mean that seems so simple. I can handle gear changes easy but I turn too hard too soon or not enough. Blame videogames? Sure. Why not. Recent favourites have included The Orange Box, Pirates!, Space Station 13 (which, without lag, a crap interface and a community of faggots whose mouths are filled with dicks bearing sores, would be one of the best online games ever) and of course, that bastard Halo. I think part of the game's appeal is the brightly coloured trinkets that appear on screen whenever you do something good. I like brightly coloured reward trinkets, I do. Who doesn't? Besides the obvious "communists" answer, I mean. You could probably make me willingly be butt raped by a gang of mountain gorillas if I got shiny trinkets for it. But that's not rape if I am willing. Huh.You've had those dreams, haven't you? The ones where you dream something mundane and then a few months later it happens. Tell me all about your experiences with them if you like. Deja vu. Prophetic dreams. I don't know. I don't care what you want to label them. One guy I knew said his theory was that because the brain is so powerful, it is capable of anaylsing everything and predicting the future or something. When I realise, I have to change it. I start waving my arms about like a freak and blabbering nonsense because that never happened in the dream. Having everything pre-determined isn't cool and it must be broken. But it's caught on. Then I remember that I acted like a spastic in my dreams too. What. Well fuck you.I feel like something is missing and I don't know what it is. It'll probably turn up sooner or later. These things always do.
