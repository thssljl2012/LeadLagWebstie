What a wonderful day here in Arkansas. I have to say I love living in the South and being a Southern girl! There is nothing like it!  There has been a lot that has been going on since the last time that I wrote in my blog. I got married to the best person ever on March 1, 2008. Since then we have moved out of our apartment and bought a house in June. Our house is in Bentonville and in the middle of nowhere, but it's not too far from the city limits. It's perfect. A new 3 bedroom/2 bathroom house that has big rooms. Who could ask for more with a "starter" home?? We added a new edition to our house. Our little schnoodle, Manny. He is the cutest thing ever! He had his first grooming appointment last week and I need to get new pictures up of him.  I quit working at Nationwide Insurance and now work at Allstate Insurance. I love every minute of it. I have a great wroking staff that I work with. I will hopefully be office manager here soon, which is what I was hired to be. So that is great.  Other than that, that really is all about it....Things are going great for us. I wish the best for everyone else and hope that everyone has as much happiness as I have!!
