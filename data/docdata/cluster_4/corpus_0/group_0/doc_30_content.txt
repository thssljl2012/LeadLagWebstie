When Steve Jobs introduced the Apple iPhone 18 months ago, he contended that viewing the Web on it was comparable to browsing on a desktop personal computer.   As it turns out, Jobs may well have understated the quality of the iPhone Web experience. Visiting Web sites that have been redesigned for the iPhone is often a quicker and more pleasing experience than it is on those increasingly cinema-style desktop displays.  It seems counterintuitive, but small really is beautiful.   The experience is not limited to special-purpose applications -- say, to public transit sites like Nextbus, which are ideally suited for viewing on a smartphone for evening commuters waiting for the next bus.  A quick trip to Web sites like Facebook, Twitter, Zillow or Powerset, all of which have been redesigned to take advantage of the iPhone, makes it clear that bigger is not necessarily better. By stripping down the Web site interface to the most basic functions, site designers can focus the user's attention and offer information without distractions.  In a look at the custom interfaces for each iPhone-aware Web site, it's obvious that reading a Facebook newsfeed or looking up the value of a friend's home on Zillow doesn't require a 20-inch computer display.
