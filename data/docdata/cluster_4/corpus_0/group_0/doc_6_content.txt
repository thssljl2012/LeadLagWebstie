          $$-BEGGING RANGEL COPS TO A 'MAIL' DYSFUNCTIONBy DAPHNE RETTER Post CorrespondentJuly 16, 2008 WASHINGTON - Rep. Charles Rangel acknowledged yesterday he may have violated House ethics rules when he used congressional stationery to solicit donations for a Harlem "center for public service" that will be named after him. Rangel has used his office letterhead to try to raise funds for the controversial center in Harlem from Donald Trump, Hank Greenberg, the former head of the AIG insurance giant, and others, it was revealed yesterday - even though congressional rules bar the stationery from being used for solicitations. "The entire thing appears dicey, and there's no question that, as soon as I can, I'm going to take a look at it," Rangel said following a report in yesterday's Washington Post exposing the practice. The Post reported last year that Rangel sent letters asking for donations for the Charles B. Rangel Center to several potential corporate donors with business before his committee. Last year, Rangel's office provided The Post with a list of some of the donations he had already helped secure for the project, which included $10 million from AIG; $500,000 from the Verizon Foundation; and $1 million from Eugene Isenberg, CEO of energy firm Nabors Industries. The Rangel Center, which would be part of City College, has been a target for Republicans and taxpayer groups since he secured nearly $2 million in "earmarks" last year to build it. The project also earned Rangel the mocking "Narcissus Award" from the Citizens Against Public Waste, which publishes a list of federal projects it deems to be pork. A spokesman for House Minority Leader John Boehner (R-Ohio) called for the House Ethics Committee to look into Rangel's actions. The Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group, indicated yesterday that it will file an ethics complaint with the committee alleging that Rangel's use of the congressional letterhead violated the rules. According to the House ethics manual, lawmakers are barred from using House stationery to solicit money. "No letterhead or envelope used in a solicitation may bear the words 'Congress of the United States,' 'House of Representatives' or 'Official Business,' nor may the letterhead or envelope bear the Seal of the United States, the Congress, or the House," the provision reads. Rangel, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, told the New York Post yesterday that the House rules have left him unsure of what is permissible. "The laws have been so vague in what we can solicit for not-for-profits that I am certain that they're making them up as we go along," Rangel said. The controversy over his letters comes during an eventful week for Rangel, who said on Monday that he would give up one of his four rent-stabilized apartments after a report finding that he was improperly using one of them as an office. daphne.retter@nypost.comEDITORIAL: Rangel-ing DonationsLabels: Charles B.
