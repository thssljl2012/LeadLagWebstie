So I got the job, as soon as I can pass the spanish speaking assesment tomorrow at 9:30am. Once I do this I'll be working for Bank of America, hopefully all goes well....now I must practice my spanish...and not the fun ghetto spanish I speak to my friends lol. So I'm calling my mom for assistance on this, sometimes I wish I had more beaner cousins. I also found out theres an urban legend about chickens living under the vineland exit of the hollywood freeway thats true...and they may have moved up an exit.
