Ok i've had a few ideas kicking about. One i'm putting into action with a friend to see how it pans out, but havent got much further than planning so far. It's a horror comedy (horrody) about four people drawn together into a dark underworld where Vampires and other such creatures exist and need to be policed and theres a particuarly nasty Vampire on the loose which must be stopped. But there's more to it i just cba to write it down. Again. &amp;nbsp; Another one is about a boxer who is persecuted for his sexuality despite obvious talent, which would hark back to the days when fighters were persecuted for their race. But he eventually overcomes the prejudice and a few early defeats and engages in a four - way rivalary with other fighters in his weight division and it's how he progresses as a fighter and a man and overcomes all the odds etc. I want it to mirror the Hagler/Hearns/Duran/Leonard rivarlary of the 80s. Some classic fights to be had. So i'll need to come up with some fighters and nicknames and write fights for the masses lol &amp;nbsp; Thoughts and comments are always welcome kids :-)
