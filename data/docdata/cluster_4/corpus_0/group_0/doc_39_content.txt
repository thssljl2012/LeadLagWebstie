"Was there a need for creation?That was hidden in a math equationAnd that's this:Where do circles begin?"~from 'The Stars are Projectors' by Modest MouseFrom evi's hovel -- Undercover economist during the day, superhero at night, and international philosopher everywhere in-between.&amp;nbsp; *KLS =&amp;nbsp; 60.0 (+3.0)-Thank God June is over.&amp;nbsp; I swear, I was afraid June was going to last another 2 or 3 months.&amp;nbsp; This year it felt like June went on forever. &amp;nbsp;-I mentioned the other day how I read the WSJ religiously now, and I do.&amp;nbsp; For me the WSJ has become the gold/platinum standard of financial news reporting.&amp;nbsp; Other newspapers to me now are like bronze or copper.&amp;nbsp; But in terms of verifiable, reliable information, the WSJ is awesome.&amp;nbsp; It's weird reading about my line of work every day in the WSJ.&amp;nbsp; When I worked at Buehler's or Kohl's, the only hope I had about reading about my occupation in the newspaper would be in the funnies section. -So I have this pet peeve against companies with "America" in their name.&amp;nbsp; American Airlines, America's Best Inns &amp;amp; Suites, TD Ameritrade, American Broadcasting Company, For companies with "America" in their name, it's like their playing off the success of America all through its history.&amp;nbsp; Seriously, what right does the "Bank of America" have to call itself THE Bank of America?&amp;nbsp; The true Bank of America I'd say is the Fed, and not the retail banking "Bank of America."&amp;nbsp; (Of course, the Federal Reserve Bank is no more "federal" than FedEx, but that's for another entry.)&amp;nbsp; But seriously, companies with "America" in their name when arguably they are not representative of America are a pet peeve of mine.&amp;nbsp; What right do they have to say they're "America's whatever"?&amp;nbsp; I remember not voting for America's best inn.-Not only this, but did you know the TD in TD Ameritrade or TD Waterhouse stands for Toronto-Dominion?!?!&amp;nbsp; I didn't know this; my Dad didn't even know this.&amp;nbsp; I can see now why they say TD.&amp;nbsp; One would be more open to working with "TD Ameritrade" than "Toronto-Dominion Ameritrade".&amp;nbsp; "TD" obviously sounds a lot more innocent than "Toronto-Dominion".&amp;nbsp; There's nothing "Toronto Dominion" about trading US stocks, US mutual funds, &amp;amp; US bonds with US companies on the US Wall Street lol. &amp;nbsp;-So I'm a big fan of sushi.&amp;nbsp; There's this new all-you-can-eat-sushi buffet in Akron that I love a lot.&amp;nbsp; It costs 15 bucks for all-you-can-eat sushi.&amp;nbsp; Now, I was playing around with the numbers, and I was able to calculate that $15.00 worth of sushi is equivalent to about 20 to 23 pieces of sushi.&amp;nbsp; ((For the sake of these numbers, I used Japanese prices where 100 to 200 will buy you 2 pieces of sushi, and where 100 is equal to $1.00.))&amp;nbsp; The prices here may be different, but the Japanese numbers work as a good estimate.)&amp;nbsp; So just to let you know, at the all-you-can-eat sushi buffet, to get your money's worth, you'd have to eat about 20-23 pieces of sushi.&amp;nbsp; Here at Levi's Hovel, we have no problem with eating about 20-23 pieces of sushi :-)&amp;nbsp; The best is tuna and salmon Nigiri-zushi.&amp;nbsp; If I could, I'd eat sushi every day I think.&amp;nbsp; Nigiri-zushi and Maki-zushi. &amp;nbsp;-Speaking of good food, I want to eat Smoked Salmon &amp;amp; Asparagus Frittata again sometime.&amp;nbsp; I haven't had it in ages, but I definitely would want to eat it again sometime. &amp;nbsp;-So I've been listening to a lot of Modest Mouse lately...as per that Modest Mouse marathon recently.&amp;nbsp; They're a very philosophical band with a very philosophical message.&amp;nbsp; Even with the title "The Moon &amp;amp; Antarctica"; it's an enigma.&amp;nbsp; Two versions of hell frozen over...with hell being loneliness.&amp;nbsp; It's clear to me that Modest Mouse has a sort of cyclical view on life.&amp;nbsp; And going along with this, I had this very strange vision the other day regarding life.&amp;nbsp; That this is all part of some cycle.&amp;nbsp; And I could see everything working its way around past death, resurrection, exaltation, billions upon billions of years in paradise, and then it all winding back around to being a "spirit child"...and then, Grand Council...and then, this.&amp;nbsp; Even beyond the standard Mormon view, in any view on metaphysics, this view scares me a bit.&amp;nbsp; And whereas I could see it being the case, I don't like it.&amp;nbsp; It's like the mysterious LDS quote of, "The course of the Lord is one eternal round" (1 Ne 10:19).&amp;nbsp; I do not think that it's a coincidence that that verse occurs time and time again with LDS Scriptures...three times in the Book of Mormon, and twice in the Doctrine &amp;amp; Covenants.&amp;nbsp; And with the mild thought of being face-to-face with God on "Kolob" or wherever, about to depart for Earth once more after trillions upon trillions of years in heaven.....well, it scares me.&amp;nbsp; And it scares me to think of spending trillions upon trillions of years in heaven when as it is, I've spent only 25 years down here.&amp;nbsp; Comparatively, let us take a look:Years potentially in heaven (and much much more):&amp;nbsp; 100,000,000,000,000Years I've been on this planet:&amp;nbsp; 25.-Just staring at those numbers scares me a bit.&amp;nbsp; And with that, who knows if this all has occurred before?&amp;nbsp; But while looking at my family, working at my job, even writing this blog, and even gazing at my girlfriend Theresa...I get this ominous sensation that perhaps this has all happened before.....a countless number of times.&amp;nbsp; Like this is all eternal; there is no time, no motion...it all just is.&amp;nbsp; Therein rests eternity.&amp;nbsp; Between economics and theology and most importantly love, therein rests eternity.&amp;nbsp; I do not like the idea of Eternal Return, but there's a piece of me that only-so-slightly can see it.&amp;nbsp; But nevertheless, I don't really care for it...but then again, perhaps it doesn't matter.&amp;nbsp; I can't be expected to remember eternal past anyhow.&amp;nbsp; But in a certain way in a world of sand and water, Theresa's like a rock to me.&amp;nbsp; A lot of Modest Mouse kind of reminds me of Theresa (in a good way).&amp;nbsp; Praise God and may God bless..."In this life like weeds you're a rock to meI know where you're fromBut where do you belong? In this life like weeds eyes need us to seeHearts need us to bleedIn this life like weeds you're the good I breed...In this life like weeds you're a rock to me."~from 'Life Like Weeds' by Modest Mouse
