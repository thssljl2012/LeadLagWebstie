The ANZ Bank is said to be shipping thousands of terminals to newsagents and other retailers in the wake of shutdown of the Bill Express network today.  This is a late move by the bank which has watched as various players have chipped away at their merchant services footprint across the Bill Express network.  I&amp;#8217;m told the new terminals will start arriving today and and that the bank has waived the usual monthly fee for three months. As announced to the ASX late yesterday, the ANZ has an interest in 13.2% of shares in Bill Express. Meanwhile, OnQ, 37.62% shareholder in Bill Express has announced that it will make a statement to the market about its future today.
