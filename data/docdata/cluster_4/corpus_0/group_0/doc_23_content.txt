LifeHacker posts that Australian bank ANZ has produced an iPhone version of their site, along with a trading application that users can install on their phones. Proof that even localized businesses can create tools for their users, that work on the tools that their users are using. That's lots of tools and users speak.What could you be doing on an iPhone? (Thanks, Justus!)
