 So t'is technically Wednesday the 9th of July and the 5th day of me staying at Jess's house.I bet I'm winding her up to fuck but, GOOD.Went to see the rocket summer and they were AWESOME! Despite all the technical difficulties...GHOSTBUSTERS!anyway. sleeping on a sofa aint that comfortable. I have major crampage everywhere.I dont know why im updating i have nothing new to say.I hate work. I want to go back to college, blah blah blah.Someone ring up South Notts College for me and ask em about photography courses and how much they are, how much discount i can get and when do they start, coz i just cba, tbh, imo.
