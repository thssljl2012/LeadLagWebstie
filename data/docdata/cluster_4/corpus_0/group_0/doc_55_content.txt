I don't know about anyone else,&amp;nbsp; but lately I'm getting quite pissed off with Bank of America!&amp;nbsp; My husband was laid off a week ago which was quite devestating for us financially. So we had to close our 401K since we have no idea what will happen down the road or whether his company will recall him and the other 1500 people they laid off. After waiting for days and days,&amp;nbsp; our 401K check finally came through.&amp;nbsp; We didn't get an "incentive" check that many Americans received from our BS government...the IRS felt they&amp;nbsp;needed &amp;nbsp;it more than we did, so they kept the money we were SUPPOSE to get! At any rate,&amp;nbsp; we went down to our bank today feeling relieved that the money finally arrived so we could pay bills and we got basically a slap in the face when BOA said they had to put a ten day hold on the check!&amp;nbsp; We were astounded! Like...WHAT THE HELL?&amp;nbsp; We've cashed our 401K checks with them before and we've been a BOA member since 1998!&amp;nbsp; We've never had a problem before.&amp;nbsp;  My husband was furious.&amp;nbsp; I wanted to be furious but knew it would only get me angry and get my blood pressure up and nothing would be accomplished.&amp;nbsp; He demanded to know why the check had to be put on hold. Surely the bank had the money. It isn't like we were cashing a million dollar check for god's sake!&amp;nbsp; The bank tellers could not tell us one damned thing.&amp;nbsp; He asked for the manager.&amp;nbsp; None was available. So we left and went to a different BOA.&amp;nbsp; Asking for a manager.&amp;nbsp; She had the audacity to tell my husband that she could give him the "Marketing manager's"&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;phone number.&amp;nbsp; WHAT????&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Why on earth would we want the marketing managers' phone number!&amp;nbsp; We just want to cash our 401K check! My husband decided to call the support center for Bank of America. After being placed on hold for 48 minutes........(we actually had dinner while being on hold!) he still could not get an answer as to why the hell our check had to be placed on a ten day hold.&amp;nbsp; He then called the company that issued our 401K check and asked them if they could just cancel the check and then send us the funds through direct deposit....thinking that surely this would be a much faster method of getting the money we've already been waiting for.&amp;nbsp; Well, to our surprise,&amp;nbsp; the company doesn't do direct &amp;nbsp;deposits! What the hell is happening to our society lately?&amp;nbsp; Banks are not willing to now cash checks! They even tried to put a ten day hold on my husband's unemployment check for gods' sake!&amp;nbsp; Are the banks now so desperate for money that they are now taking advantage of people by holding onto their money for absolutely no reason?&amp;nbsp; People on unemployment need their money!&amp;nbsp; Hello!&amp;nbsp; Is anybody home at those damned banks?&amp;nbsp; We called many different banks and got the same story.&amp;nbsp; They are now placing holds on checks for up to ten days if the checks don't come from their own banks! We are so pissed off.&amp;nbsp; A friend of ours said we could cash it at a check cashing store but they wanted over $200 to cash the check! Screw that! We'll have to just wait the ten days to get our money and suffer. I was especially angry about this because we had plans for my cousin to come up here so we could take our boat out and now our plans have had to be cancelled.&amp;nbsp; I'm so pissed.&amp;nbsp; Just kick me when I'm already down you SOB bank of America!
