      &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Here's today's Half Wit Headlines:  BofA 2Q Profit Shrinks, Beats Wall Street  Stocks Higher After Bank of America Results  Bank of America still made money and so the implication is that the credit crunch is coming to an end.&amp;nbsp; I am not making that up.&amp;nbsp; That's what the second article concluded.&amp;nbsp; All's good, the worst is over.&amp;nbsp; Whew!  Oh yeah.&amp;nbsp; For the record, the market closed down 29 points.&amp;nbsp; So much for the attempted Jedi Mind Trick.&amp;nbsp; It seems to me that it's going to be harder and harder to hide the truth.&amp;nbsp; The Fed keeps changing how they measure the economy and so they reported today that the economy is still going up.&amp;nbsp; We are not in a recession.&amp;nbsp; Inflation is at the highest it has been in 30 years, unemployment is going up, foreclosures are at record levels, gas is headed for $5 a gallon on its way to $7, the stock market is crashing, but we are not, I repeat NOT in a recession.  Here's a clue about the end of the credit crunch.&amp;nbsp; It won't end until one of two things happen:  Everyone starts using only cash to make purchases and works at paying off their debt; or  House prices exceed where they were when the bubble burst so that people can start borrowing against them again.  I hate to break the bad news to the Wall Street expert that wrote the article but I haven't seen either of these two criteria met so it's my purely uninformed and uneducated guess that there is still a credit crunch and that Wall Street is going to continue its downward trend.  I started the day with a phone call at 3am from work.&amp;nbsp; Have I mentioned lately that I'm working on a plan to be out of the casino within a year?  I managed to get back to sleep by 3:45 and then I was back up at 5 for a 4 mile run.&amp;nbsp; When I got back, I ran Tia through the rough draft of an exercise circuit that I'm going to be using in September.&amp;nbsp; She liked it and there is very little tweaking that I can see needs to be done at this point.&amp;nbsp; That's good.  I started into a Turbulence Training session when I got home from work but I just couldn't get into it so I quit before I was done.&amp;nbsp; It's not like I'm not getting some exercise elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; =)  I'm sure I have more to say but my brain is shutting down for the night.&amp;nbsp; It's been too long of a day, I guess and I'm getting up early tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; Early means 4am.&amp;nbsp; I'm doing a test run from now through August to see if I can pull off teaching a fitness class for women while still working on my own fitness.&amp;nbsp; The trick is, will I be able to do it without sacrificing sleep?&amp;nbsp; Get up early isn't a sacrifice if I go to bed early.&amp;nbsp; It's just a big puzzle piece where I have to figure out how to fit in long miles of running before it gets hot, teach my fitness and martial arts classes, work my day job, fulfill my City Council duties, watch a 4 year old, and fit in a bit of family time.&amp;nbsp; No problem, eh?  ***  If you have a fitness goal and want a support partner, I'd love to help.&amp;nbsp; I offer my ecoaching service at no charge for people with fitness goals.&amp;nbsp; If you want to take advantage of this offer while it lasts, sign up at my Team Beach Body site (again, no charge) and drop me an email and get started creating a healthy, fit you.
