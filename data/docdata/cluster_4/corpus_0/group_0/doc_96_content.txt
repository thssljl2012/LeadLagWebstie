Bank of America interns are apparently being paid by the hour this year (as they were last), though this time it's based on a 65 hour week, up from last summer's 40. Not sure if this is punishment for not being able to eat a measly four egg McMuffins in under fifty minutes, but the seasonal employees were informed of the additional fifteen after their arrival, and the monumental failure took place maybe only a couple days in, so it certainly seems plausible.  The 65 hour week is for commercial bank interns; the base for those in IB is 55.
