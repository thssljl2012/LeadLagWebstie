 Hm, I guess things have a way of working out.&amp;nbsp; I felt alone for a bit, but then I realized having a gigantose comfy hotel room to myself wasn't all that bad.&amp;nbsp; I spread out over about five pillows and fiddled on my laptop. I missed my orientation by a day ( D= ), but in place got a one on one introduction to Pitt's CBA.&amp;nbsp; My classes for the fall aaarrree :- Calculus- Microeconomics- Intro to Psychology- Some management class- And Japanese III &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Not bad, not bad.&amp;nbsp; I should learn not to doubt life and its ways.&amp;nbsp; I've actually realized, that I'm not sure how I am going to afford a mattress.&amp;nbsp; This is a problem, because I already have a bed frame picked out, but nothing to put in it.&amp;nbsp; Hmmm.&amp;nbsp; I was not aware how much mattresses cost.&amp;nbsp; But, apparently they are several hundred.&amp;nbsp; Gah.&amp;nbsp; While searching for a mattress yesterday, Dustin and I played hide and seek in Bed, Bath, and Beyond.&amp;nbsp; Best. place.&amp;nbsp; evarrr.&amp;nbsp; For hide and seek, that is.&amp;nbsp;
