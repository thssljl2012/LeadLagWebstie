 Bank of America totally screwed us over again with the help of AT&amp;amp;T.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We were behind on over bill this month so on the 1st we sent in a check for about half of what we owed.&amp;nbsp; We thought they took it out in that pay period but no.&amp;nbsp; They just took it out.&amp;nbsp; Which totally screwed us up for this paycheck and the next.&amp;nbsp; Thanks to the overdraft on everything that came out after AT&amp;amp;T screwed us up we won't get much out of the next check either.&amp;nbsp; If we need groceries I guess we can sell some movies and games but I dunno what to do about the rest.&amp;nbsp; I'd talk to mom and maybe she and dad would help out a little but I guess she's got a&amp;nbsp; meeting or something 'cause I haven't been able to talk to her at all today.&amp;nbsp; I guess I could call dad.&amp;nbsp; He's got a cell phone and apparently has it on but he has it on to hear when I've gone into labor and I don't want to get his hopes up like that.&amp;nbsp; I guess we can oh i don't know.
