I have been told that an ANF staffer has called some newsagents today and told them to NOT install the eftpos terminals sent by the ANZ bank.  This, on the back of ANF email communication to newsagents today advising newsagents to approach the ANZ terminal offer with caution could look to some like a call for a collecive boycott. For five years the ANF offered robust endorsement of the ANZ eftpos arrangements.   Late last year when considerably better rates were available for newsagents elsewhere, the ANF continued its support of the ANZ.  Now that now the ANF no longer has a financial relationship tied to the ANZ it is saying the their rates are not competitive. I would have thought that an association would always recommend what is bets for memebrs rather than what is best for it.  It is this pursuit of its oiwn commercail interests over the commercail interests of members which created the problem for the ANF in this Bill Express mess. As for the possible collective boycott, wise counsel to the ANF would be that they get the loose mouthed staffer to stop telling newsagents to boycott the ANZ.
