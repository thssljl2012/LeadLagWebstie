 Does it really pay to be a good Samaritan these days? After reading this article, the question that pops in my mind would I step in to help others in distress, even if my life is in danger? Please respond to the poll after reading the article.  The family of a banking executive who was beaten to death after confronting a gang of men he had seen attacking a young couple said that he had paid the &amp;#8220;ultimate price&amp;#8221; for being a good citizen.   Frank McGarahan, 45, the chief operating officer of Barclays Wealth, who was in charge of assets worth 133 billion in 20 countries, had approached the men who had assaulted a homeless Lithuanian man and his girlfriend.   Police said that there was an &amp;#8220;exchange of words&amp;#8221; before the men launched an attack on Mr McGarahan. They knocked him to the ground and then continued to kick and punch him.   He was taken to hospital after paramedics tried to revive him but he died on Monday after the assault in the early hours of Sunday morning.
