not for being a crook but a good Samaritan:Times Online, 9/30/08--Detectives hunting the killers of a senior banking executive are today hunting for at least five men who are believed to have been caught on CCTV running from the scene of the street attack early on Sunday morning. Frank McGarahan, 45, the chief operating officer of Barclays Wealth, in charge of assets worth 133 billion in 21 countries, was out with his brother and another male ahead of a family christening later that day in Norwich. As they queued for a taxi at the Guildhall Hill rank at 3am Mr McGarahan spotted a man being attacked by a group of youths and is believed to have shouted at the gang to stop. Police say he did not physically intervene. [...].................................I spent nearly nine months in Norwich and was just there this June.
