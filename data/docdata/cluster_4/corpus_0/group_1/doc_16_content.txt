 Holy wow, I'm tired.  I think this whole working for a month without a day off is finally getting to me.So (so so so) close to getting rid of my couch today.  Posted an ad, got a response, set up a time, only to have the person bow out because work is sending them out of town.  Bugga.  Had a response on my entertainment center, but I wasn't available that night for him to swing by, and now he's MIA, so hopefully I'll get another response on it.I need to figure out if there's a random day next week where I can take off work to get some stuff done (this is wishful thinking - I'm working this weekend as well).  Apparently, there isn't a Bank of America within 100 miles of my parents' house, thus I need to close my account and open up another at a bank closer to them (they'll be depositing my paychecks - independent contractors don't get direct deposit).  I just don't feel right making them drive 30 minutes every month to the BOA ATM at the nearest mall (nice how there's an ATM around, but no bank, eh?).  And here I was under the impression that there were BOAs everywhere (DC has an ATM or banking center every 3 blocks or so).  I forget that small town America isn't as convenient as the city...I also need to carry a box to the recycling center in town, which is thankfully only 8 blocks from my place, so totally walkable.I need to start cleaning, since my move-out is going to be pretty quick and I won't have time to go back in after my stuff's cleared out.  I hate cleaning when there's boxes everywhere.What am I forgetting to do?  Everything but what I need for the next 2 weeks is packed, save for the kitchen stuff, which is being dropped off at Goodwill anyway... I know I'm missing something...
