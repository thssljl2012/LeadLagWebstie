 I had planned to get out and walk around, and possibly see the Memphis Redbirds play, but a mammoth line of Thunderstorms is blowing in this evening. So instead, I'm watching Nancy Pelosi... maybe I'll watch the SciFi channel. She has very little ability to project feeling into her speeches. I would never cast her in a Commedia play, she is just too weak an actor.Another Topic:I got a call from my Sister-In-Law, who has been having trouble with her computer ever since her kids did some downloading. Every time she goes to make some kind of financial transaction (Lands End, Bank of America, etc) when she gets to the page to do the transaction Internet Explorer comes back with a message saying that the Certificate is no longer valid. I tried helping her, making some blind attempts at clearing cookies etc. I was unable to make a difference. Any suggestions as to probable causes and solutions?
