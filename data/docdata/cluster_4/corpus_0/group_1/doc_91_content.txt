 I turn 18 on the 3rd of August (tomorrow, on Sunday). I officially become an adult....mortgages, voting, driving among other things await my pleasuring. I'm debating whether I should bother with a celebration. Below is a summary of the pros and cons of having some kind of celebration. Enjoy:PROS:- A big social gathering with all my good friends. It would be immeasurably enjoyable.- It's a big deal (or so I'm led to believe from others) to turn eighteen. I am now an adult (thanks to the random selection of this arbitrary number) and able to indulge in whatever gratifying activities I choose...no matter how poorly my parents and seniors look down on them.- Some of my friends are eager to meet my other friends. A party would have the effect of cementing social networking groups...as technical as it may sound.- I might indulge in going to a nightclub or strip-club or whatever...and no, I'm not a facile fool.- I like receiving presents.CONS:- Not all of my friends like each other. Some are very different and others are antagonistic.- I'm extremely lazy, and would thus be unwilling to bother with a party.- I'm not prepared to host a function for a dozen friends, extended family or whoever.- I don't really care about my birthday. It's just a random date to which people celebrate.- I don't want a severe hangover or 'complications' arising from a night out on the town...especially since final exams are a mere two months away.- Previous birthday celebrations have not been so successful. I might be good at planning cities, but planning parties is another thing altogether.- I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with adulthood. The burden of responsibility, stupid Westpac bank account taxation and the sudden deterioration of innocence are all daunting elements of adulthood.
