The NY Observer  by Chris Shott    The "debacle at Atlantic Yards" makes a cameo appearance in this Observer story about the massive catering operation at the U.S. Open, run by Levy Restaurants, the Chicago-based food-service giant tapped to provide chow at Bruce Ratner's Barclays Center &amp;#151; should it ever get built.       In 2010, the company plans to make its second foray into the coveted New York market, after signing on to handle concessions at the forthcoming Barclay Center, future home of the NBAs Brooklyn Nets, at developer Bruce Ratners controversial Atlantic Yards complex in Prospect Heights.        I think the buildings going to be spectacular, said Mr. Lansing. You know, a lot of the arenas, historically, have been, well, not cookie-cutterish because theyre all a little bit different, but they follow a similar mold. But when you have Frank Gehry design an arena and really break the moldthats pretty ambitious.        He added, Some of the things that were going to do with the Nets are going to be revolutionary.        Of course, it will also feature the usual Brooklyn staples. Can you say egg creams? Absolutely, Mr. Lansing said. We know Brooklyn pizza, you know, we get it. We understand the locals. We understand what they want.     article    NoLandGrab: Hmmm. Not "cookie-cutterish?" They "understand the locals?" So the Nets are hiring a mega-caterer from the Midwest to serve "Brooklyn pizza" and egg creams?    Commenter Norman Oder also points out that Levy might need to rebook those 2010 tickets for, say, 2011.
