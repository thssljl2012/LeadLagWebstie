 spent the night at a dorm. man, different world and yet the same. everyone's attached to their cell phones and gps around here. but no wireles that i've been able to pick up. bank of america messed up again, and it won't let me fix it online. bad_influence - thanks for the surprise. i found it. i think. :) i got forgotten in the hubbub this morning, but it gave me a chance to read "Angels and Demons" completely - since i've been up since 2am. &amp;gt;.&amp;lt; damn body. i just may run out of books here. Next on the list - generation kill. not reading lj. but love and kisses to you all. craziness looms quickly.
