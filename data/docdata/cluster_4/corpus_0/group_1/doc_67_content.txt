On the home page, I have a new (old) piece up about Joe Biden.  In 1998, I went to Delaware to look into the circumstances under which Biden had sold a house.  It had been a minor issue in his 1996 re-election campaign, but when I got there, I found that it was just a small part of Biden's very close relationship with MBNA, the giant Delaware-based credit-card company (which was bought by Bank of America in 2006).  It turned out to be a portrait of how Biden's very-old Washington ways worked.  And by the way, Biden's up for re-election this year, right? Has there been any announcement of what he'll do about that? I believe he can run for re-election simultaneously, but will he take advantage of that hedge?
