 I defy anyone who has any passion for London 2012 Olympics to defend this embarassment of a performance, displayed to the entire world during the 2008 closing ceremony.What do we have to showcase to the world, following what was, even to me, a rather dazzling show by the Chinese? A London red bus (Ok, iconic of London, but terminally cliche), a bus stop, umbrellas, an army of scruffy chav-inspired "performers" (although they looked like they were crawling around the floor looking for the drugs they dropped), David Beckham, Lewona Lewis, and whats-his-name from Led Zepplin. Is that the best they can do? A manufactured pop singer, an air-head footballer, and a dinosaur-rocker?And lets not forget the Pakistani girl, apparantly chosen by viewers of Blue Peter to represent all British children (and we all know how trustworthy BBC, specifically Blue Peter competitions are), walking over submissive people over and over. Yes, how very telling. Even the commentator didn't offer any better explaination of that strange symbolism.And somehow, as if to add insult to injury, my new Lloyds-TSB debit card is one big London 2012 logo with a smaller version in the corner, in case I missed it in the middle. Yes, every fucking time I make a purchase in the next four years, I'm reminded of this sodding thing by that shameful "inspiring" logo. I find that really insulting. I hope they can send me a different card, else I'll consider this the last straw with Lloyds and move my finances elsewhere.
