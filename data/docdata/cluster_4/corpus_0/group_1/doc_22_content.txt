The U.S. team captain has four spots to fill. The results of the weekend's Barclays tournament probably didn't help him much with the choices.                                                                                            Be fair. You need to give credit when it's due, and the FedEx Cup playoffs got off to a rousing start over the weekend when the Barclays didn't just wind up in a playoff, but it was a playoff featuring big names Vijay Singh and Sergio Garcia.
