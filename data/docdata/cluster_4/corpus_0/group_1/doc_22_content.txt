 I had dinner with an old friend last night.&amp;nbsp;In the hope to gripe about - what else - but work. Yet again.&amp;nbsp;In fact, he worked at Barclays and I SO&amp;nbsp;wanted him to get me a freakin job. Yeah. I decided that I had about enough of the crap I had to take at work. It was affecting my mood, my appetite, my health,&amp;nbsp;the extra lines on my face and&amp;nbsp;most importantly, my friendships - which I cherish VERY&amp;nbsp;greatly - at work.&amp;nbsp;Well,&amp;nbsp;I ended&amp;nbsp;up buying him dinner. Because&amp;nbsp;the lessons I took home were amazingly enlightening and inspiring.&amp;nbsp;Amongst the many inspirational quotes, the ONE most memorable&amp;nbsp;was this:&amp;nbsp;HAPPINESS IS A CHOICE. NOT A DESTINATION.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Something as simple as this has eluded so many of us&amp;nbsp;so long a&amp;nbsp;time.&amp;nbsp;All thanks to bloody Disney and those&amp;nbsp;annoying fairy-tales we&amp;nbsp;grew up with.&amp;nbsp;Come fucking on. When we&amp;nbsp;were young,&amp;nbsp;we learnt - and believed - that we&amp;nbsp;had to climb some stupid beanstalk, kill&amp;nbsp;some evil witch, or big bad wolf, or&amp;nbsp;some&amp;nbsp;vile old&amp;nbsp;stepmother who looked into some lying talking&amp;nbsp;mirror, and for some, get rid of seven dwarfs&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;climb&amp;nbsp;up&amp;nbsp;some bizare woman's hair to get to&amp;nbsp;some castle,&amp;nbsp;so that we COULD LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER.&amp;nbsp;Are we going to continue to delude ourselves?&amp;nbsp;So, that means that&amp;nbsp;only - and ONLY - when&amp;nbsp;I reach a certain&amp;nbsp;position in a certain company, drive a certain car, live in a certain district, and&amp;nbsp;marry a certain wife, and get a certain&amp;nbsp;type of blowjob - would I&amp;nbsp;finally be happy.&amp;nbsp;I decided that I was NOT going to allow&amp;nbsp;something as&amp;nbsp;small as work make&amp;nbsp;me unhappy. And I choose to be happy. Because everyone likes&amp;nbsp;to be&amp;nbsp;around a happy person. And I WAS a happy person.&amp;nbsp;So, fuck all this crap. I AM going to be, and will succeed in becoming a MUCH happier person that I am. Yippeee! Yipppeee!&amp;nbsp;Ok, now I sound loony.&amp;nbsp;But yes, the truth is that I have many things to celebrate about. Lasting friendships, great colleagues,&amp;nbsp;healthy parents, and&amp;nbsp;of course,&amp;nbsp;The Puppy.&amp;nbsp;The list goes on: a&amp;nbsp;sizeable chest, abs at my age, a&amp;nbsp;nice perky ass, loads of attitude,&amp;nbsp;absolutely&amp;nbsp;fabulous style,&amp;nbsp;a nice-sized dick, and of course,&amp;nbsp;my innate, wonderful&amp;nbsp;ability to give a damn&amp;nbsp;freakin good blowjob. And for that, I SHALL be happy. So, fuck all the negativity&amp;nbsp;in the world.&amp;nbsp;And the people who create&amp;nbsp;them.&amp;nbsp;Ok, now I sound like a bloody hippee.
