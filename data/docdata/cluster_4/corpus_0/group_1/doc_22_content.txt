After two consecutive withdrawals from tournaments due to injury and illness, Myrtle Beach resident Dustin Johnson vows he won't miss another scheduled round of golf this year.The 24-year-old PGA Tour rookie withdrew from the RBC Canadian Open on July 26 before completing the second round due to a toothache that required a root canal, and withdrew after the first round of last week's Wyndham Championship in Greensboro, N.C., with a cut on his right pinkie finger.Johnson hopes his run of bad luck is over, and said the finger has healed sufficiently for him to play in this week's $7 million The Barclays at Ridgewood Country Club in Paramus, N.J., the first of four FedEx Cup Playoff events.
