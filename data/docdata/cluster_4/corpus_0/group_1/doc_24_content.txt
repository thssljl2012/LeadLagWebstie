 Things are definitely looking up this morning!Yesterday after work, I talked to my dad...who still didn't come home. He's going to have to be home this weekend if he thinks he's going to Singapore on Monday.Went to Steve-oh's, watched Squidbillies, smoked a couple of bowls, and then went home really early. My ankle was feeling much better so I tried running but I only got about 10 minutes in...fucking weak! I went from 30 minutes a day to 10? But oh well. I've noticed I've been looking pretty good and a bit more on the lean side again...so that is awesome..especially when I'm super bloated.Brendon sent me a couple of messages last night. He said it was lame that I can't see him and that I need to go up there soon. And a lot of the things he says...sooo captivating...he is quite the charmer. I don't know exactly how he does it. He's so calm yet bewildering with his talents.Woke up pretty early, cleaned, got ready for work.Got to work early as well. I just called Bank of America since I checked my balance and the bullshit charges that were made on my card are gone! I'm back to having $871. Better than nothing!So yeah, I just need to go to the bank and get a temporary card and then they'll send me a new one. YAY!!!Not to mention, tomorrow's Friday, The Clone Wars is out, I can get my Reggie ticket...and Cheech and Chong have another date set up for Houston so I want to see if I can just trade my tickets so me and my brother can go out on Halloween.Ahh..and if my dad comes home with all this money..I could be doing so many things. Let us cross our fingers.-emily
