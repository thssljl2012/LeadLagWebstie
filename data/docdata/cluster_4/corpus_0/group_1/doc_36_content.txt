I proudly patronize local businesses whenever possible-- especially when it comes to brick and mortar book shops. I love amazon, but there is something special about browsing *real titles on the *real shelves of a *real bookstore where you can talk with *real people. I find books I never knew existed when I do this.   Christian bookstores, on the other hand, are places that I go out of my way not to patronize-- because everyone knows they don't sell books. They sell creepy Jesus junk (which we have in abundance in this 100 year old church building we have inherited).  In response to Justin Taylor's observations regarding John's Christian Bookstore going out of business, Frank Turk posts his thoughts on Christian retail:  Let's face it: the Christian bookstore is dying. Christian retail is, frankly, a sort of quaint and old-fashioned idea. I didn't grow up Christian, but the CBA indie store in my hometown looked like a flea market and nobody could answer questions for me; I have visited worse -- stores in locations arsonists wouldn't bother to burn down. And at one time, it was at least a novelty to have someplace that would put your name on your Bible and had exotic items like "anointing oil" and those plastic fish the really-devout put on their cars.  Turk offers some great insights by comparing Christian Bookstores to Barnes and Noble. It is well worth the read.
