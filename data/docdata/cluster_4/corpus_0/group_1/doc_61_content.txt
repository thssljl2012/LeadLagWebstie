I got a lot of feedback from my investigation into Banks feesthat aired July 29th.

We reported that Bank of America defended its practice of charging its customers &amp;#8220;overdraft&amp;#8221; fees on transactions that hadn&amp;#8217;t actually been processed by saying that &amp;#8220;9 out of the top 13 banks share this practice.&amp;#8221; Of course, after the story aired, Erin Cluchey emailed with a logical question: In the news story regarding banks charging fees for &amp;#8220;Pending transactions&amp;#8221; it stated that nine out of thirteen banks are using this practice. I was wondering if there was a list of the nine banks now using this practice. I would also like to know which of the 13 are not. I think I&amp;#8217;m going to switch to one of those banks so I would like to find out who they are. Thanks very much. Well, duh??? I immediately asked myself whyI didn&amp;#8217;t ask Bank of America to provide a list of those banks whena spokespersonused that line for their defense. I told Erin I would find out andgetback to him.

This morning, I have received a few emails from consumers who want to know which 9 banks have that policy and which 4 do not.  Amy, Thanks for the follow up. I don&amp;#8217;t have a list of the banks but the best source would be the American Bankers Association. Diane Wagner SVP, Media Relations Bank of America  OK&amp;#8230; let&amp;#8217;s try ABA: From: Amy Davis [mailto:adavis@kprc.com] Sent: Wednesday, July 30, 2008 4:16 PM To: Nessa Feddis; Carol Kaplan Subject: Bank Fees story   Hi Nessa &amp;amp; Carol, The story on bank fees and changing policies aired in our 10pm newscast last night. Diane Wagner with bank of America also told us (and we reported) that 9 out of the top 13 banks in the US share BOAs policy for charging overdraft fees on pending transactions. Diane told me that you guys would have that information. That would be great if you could send me a list. Thanks again, Amy Davis KPRC Local 2 Investigates Amy, Thanks. Sorry, we do not have a list of those banks.  Back to Bank of America&amp;#8230; let&amp;#8217;s push a little harder: Amy&amp;#8211;What I can tell you is that the information is factual, and we stand by the accuracy of our information. But for competitive reasons, we are not going to disclose who these banks are. Diane will not have anything further to add. I hope this helps. Thanks T  I don&amp;#8217;t know&amp;#8230; does it help you??
