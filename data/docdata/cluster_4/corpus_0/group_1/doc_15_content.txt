 Over the next few weeks we need to finalize all of our travel plans for the November 2008 real estate investment cruise. This includes flight bookings and travel insurance for those who have requested help. It also includes paying the balance of the cruise booking.  AIG Travel Guard has a number of medical and trip insurance packages.  For more details follow this link.I will be in touch with everyone who has booked to go through their plans and offer any additional travel booking support.I have been asked if we have any additional cabins left at the $266 (inside) and $296 (outside) rate. I do. But I need to contact Carnival and give up all of the unclaimed cabins within the next few weeks. So get to me soon at fujibob@hotmail.com if you know of someone who may want to join us.
