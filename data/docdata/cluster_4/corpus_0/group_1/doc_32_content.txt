 There was a very interesting, yet quite amusing story published on the BBC News Website the other day involving a telephone call centre worker who has been fired for changing the banking password of a customer.The story involves a less than happy customer of Lloyds TSB who elected "Lloyds is pants" to be his telephone banking password.The operative then changed the password without the customer's permission to: "no it's not".Slightly amused, but still disgruntled the customer then changed his password to: "Barclays is better".See Man's 'pants' password is changed for more details.PLEASE complete one of questionnaires on employee use of the Internet!
