Accounts belonging to Andy Hornby, 41, who earns an estimated 1m a year, were frozen after unauthorised withdrawals of at least 7,000 from his accounts. UK tabloid The Sun reports that crooks used an old bank statement from Hornby to pose as the bank chief. So what makes this identity theft interesting? Perhaps this: Last year HBOS and Barclays were among 11 UK banks warned by the Information Commissioners Office to stop the then widespread practice of dumping documents related to customer accounts in bins outside their stores. Each of the banks signed undertakings to discontinue the behaviour. The ICO later audited HBOS after it emerged it may have been in breach of its promise to clean up its act. The follow-up action was triggered after BBC Watchdog discovered torn up bank statements that revealed customer names and account numbers and a untorn cheque for nearly 1,700 in a bin outside a HBOS branch weeks after the ICO&amp;#8217;s initial warning. Ouch.
