 Hello!Well, this summer's been a big ol' pile of unproductive so I thought I would make a livejournal. So I can do more writing and less, you know, self pitying. I've committed myself to a livejournal several times in the past, and I think I know why now. I always try to write about my live. And my life is boring. SO VERY BORING. No one wants to read about how Bank of America almost screwed me out of my Avenue Q tickets (still not over it!) or the various cute behaviors of my puppy dog Fitzy. Although he is a cutie. But I digress. My life is boring and I hate writing about it. So instead, I shall go on and on about things that are interesting (or at least interest me.) That means the things I've gotten into over the summer. Mixing drinks, cooking, baking, writing, and television of course. Watching Futurama right now. I want to have a "headache with pictures." Sounds better than my headaches. Anyway, that's it. Hi again :D
