McDonald's, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, UPS, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Coca-Cola, Panasonic, Visa, Bank of America, AT&amp;amp;T, Kodak, GE, Omega, Samsung, Budweiser, Haier, Staples, Snickers, Tsingtao, Adidas and&amp;nbsp;VolksWagon. These companies are the offical sponsors of the 2008 Olympic Games. These are also the companies I will be boycotting due the the fact that China is the largest human rights violators (along with the Middle East and Israel). Of course due to the magnitude&amp;nbsp; and scope of interests these companies have it will be impossible to boycott them for extended periods of time. I'll only boycott the duration of the Olympic Games.
