A few more details on the pane of the glass that fell from 1 Times Square (where the ball drops on New Year's) yesterday afternoon:  The 3' by 5' chunk was "between the seventh and eight floors" of the 23-floor building.  The glass landed on a car, and the police later closed the area.  The Department of Buildings says somehow the pane "had become dislodged" (the building's owner received a citation). Apparently there is renovation work going on at the building--but not that that particular window, so there mystery continues.  Luckily no one was hurt, the way two people were when a 1,500 pound piece of glass fell from the Bank of America building down the street last week.
