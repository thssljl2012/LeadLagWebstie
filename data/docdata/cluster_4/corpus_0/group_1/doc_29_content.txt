 So I'll probably have a more thorough evaluation of all the candidates later on, but I have to say my current preference for running with Obama is...    Chris Dodd.  Who?  During the debates, Chris Dodd performed better than the front runners including the current nominee, at least in my ever so humble opinion.  He managed to come across as both articulate and passionate, and while I knew he was never a serious contender for the top slot,  I think he would be a strong addition to the bottom of the ticket.  I'll get into why I'm not a big fan of the other candidates in a future post.  For right now, this one is about why I like Dodd.  Dodd has some pretty solid liberal credentials, including a few well-earned kudos that I really wish our current nominee could claim.  Dodd could serve as a vicious liberal attack dog, attacking McCain and the conservatives while allowing Obama to keep above the fray.  Obama stays Mr. Hope, Change, and Peacemaker, while Dodd throws the left some red meat, and calls McCain to task on some of the really stupid shit he's been doing lately.  Dodd does have some drawbacks.  Being tied to Countrywide at all is more than a problem in the current climate*.  But other than that, Dodd's record seems to be rather clear for someone who has been in politics for 34 years**.  I think it would be nice if Obama gave Sen. Dodd a shot.  I know he isn't as big a name as Gore, Biden, Richardson, or Clinton, but, really who needs all that extra baggage?  [*] Especially for this Bank of America stockholder.
