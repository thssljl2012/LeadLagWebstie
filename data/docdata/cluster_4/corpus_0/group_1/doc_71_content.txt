 Dear spammers, If you want to be convincing, write your emails in real English... Do you really think (even allowing for me being stupid enough to click on any email I am not expecting relating to a bank account I don't access online) that I would be stupid enough to click on any link in an email worded thus:"Dear Lloyds TSB Customer,Sensitive area to your Online banking account has been limited due to a mis-match of access code between your memorable informations. To enable you continue accessing your online account, it will only take you few minutes to re-activate your account."Yeah, right...
