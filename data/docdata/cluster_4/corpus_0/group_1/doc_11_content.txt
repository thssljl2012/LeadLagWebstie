I&amp;#8217;d be interested to see what others think of this&amp;#8221;. Well, I&amp;#8217;ve been down there a few times over the last few days, and it has been functioning perfectly every time! So I&amp;#8217;m not sure whether you&amp;#8217;re thinking of a different one? As far as I know, there are four cashpoints in Blackheath village:  Two at Lloyds Bank. One Natwest branded one in the station. One at Barclays Bank, near the library.  But have I missed any?
