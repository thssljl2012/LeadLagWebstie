At this point, it seems that sadly only one of these negotiations is ready for a happy ending.  The romance aspect of this story is due to a husband and wife duo of Finsec bargaining team members  Carl Macken from Sovereign and Nola Macken from ANZ National. In both sets of negotiations, the employer started with pay offers of 4%. However, in the second round of negotiations Sovereign moved their offer to 4.3%, which Finsec members will be voting on shortly. ANZ National have yet to move their offer. Nola Macken says its unfortunate that ANZ National have not listened to staff yet, unlike her husbands employer. Both taking part in negotiations has definitely introduced an element of competition in our house. Alls fair in love and war! she says. But we are in agreement that ANZ National should follow Sovereigns lead and come up with a fairer offer.            Well always have bargaining        Paid union meetings for ANZ National staff to vote on the banks 4% offer continue next week, as do meetings for Westpac staff to vote on their 5% deal.
