Dear Edward and Pamela, Can I call you Ed and Pam? I feel like I know you well enough to cut the formality. You probably don't recognize my name - in fact I would hope not.. There should be no reason that you would know me. I'm Amber: the person that was given your old phone number when you changed yours! Actually, "given" has the implication that it was a gift, and I must say friends, I must have been a bad girl this year!The lending establishments from which you borrowed (and now owe) don't seem to believe me when I say that, "You have the wrong number."  I'm sure it's just a BIG misunderstanding that you forgot to change your number with them....with ALL of them. Anyway, the reason for the note is because there were a couple things I wanted to let you know!Ed - Bank of America really wants to talk to you .. like REALLY wants to talk to you. While you're returning that call, you also need to drop a line to Orchard bank, and Discover card.  Pam - Along with the financing companies listed above - Your friend Debbie called to remind you that she's on her way into town and wants to make sure your home... she said she hasn't heard from you for days. ALSO! Please call your doctor! It's time for your annual mammogram!Your unrequited secretary, Amber
