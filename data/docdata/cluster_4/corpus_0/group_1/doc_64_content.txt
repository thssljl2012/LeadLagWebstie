It can be daunting to find, compare, and then apply for the best reward credit cards. American Express, Citibank, Chase, Discover, Capital One, Bank of America, and other credit card companies offer dozens of competing Visa, MasterCard, AmEx, and Discover credit cards. Their credit cards' reward structures for cashback, frequent flyer airline miles, and points are a complex mix of tiers, limits, categories, and earning percentages.  The Credit Card Tune-Up calculator makes all of that easy.  Just plug in how much you spend each month, press Enter, and you'll be presented with a list of recommended cards sorted from best to worst by your expected first-year annual reward.  All reward currencies (miles, points, cashback) are translated into dollars for an easy apples-to-apples comparison.And don't forget to keep this blog alive and well by tipping me           Read and post comments            Send to a friend
