The Bank of America building, on the corner of Broadway East and East Thomas Street, was, no doubt, quite fresh in the 1960sthe slate on the exterior walls, the little moat of rocks, the windy plaza facing a blank wall. It is, needless to say, all quite stale now.    A chipper receptionist answered the phone today, Thank you for calling Bank of America, the bank of opportunities.   But the next opportunity will be a wrecking ball. SRM Development filed plans with the city this month to demolish the bank and rip up the adjoining parking lot, replacing them with two buildings. The first phase will be a four-story building on 10th Avenue; the second will be a six-story building over the bank site on Broadway. Combined, they will contain 13,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor and 113 apartments above.  SMR bought the land within the last month, says Melissa Wechsler, project manager for the Runberg Architecture Group. One thing to keep in mind that the light-rail station will be a block from the site, she says. She expects construction to begin in 2010. The bank is going to be moved back there eventually, she says.      An early-design guidance meeting will be held at 6:30 p.m. on September 3 at 6:30 p.m. in the Seattle Vocational Institute, 2120 South Jackson Street. Interested folks should go to this meetingthe first in a series, and the best chance to frame the neighborhood's needs.   In the last few years, weve seen a several fugly new and proposed mid-rise buildings on Broadway (Brix is the exception). Particularly disappointing is the trash heap at the end of Broadway and the slapdash box under construction at the site of the old QFC. Don't let it happen again.
