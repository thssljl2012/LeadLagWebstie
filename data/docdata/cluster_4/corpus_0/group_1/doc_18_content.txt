I have been contacted by several newsagents over the last two days who have found it particularly difficult to cancel direct debit arrangements for their now useless Bill Express equipment.  In each case their bank, the ANZ, has refused to act on their written instructions. My understanding is that this is a breach of the Australian Bankers&amp;#8217; Association Code of Banking Practice.    It will be interesting to see whether a formal complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service can resolve the disputes. To balance this I would note that several other newsagents have been refunded amounts taken by their bank after they canceled their direct debit arrangements.
