where luck is just on your side. So this morning I read something very interesting. I just love being proven right, because I don't feel like the hypocrite. It started off then. I got to work and Janis, the manager, was running a bit late. It was just me and her this morning. (9-5) She goes, &amp;quot;Let's go to the bank.&amp;quot; I look at her and go, &amp;quot;Umm...will we make it back in time to open?&amp;quot; She goes,&amp;quot;yeah.&amp;quot; So we went to Bank of America, and I stayed in the car while she went in. I was stuck listening to Britney Spears. AHHH. Then I looked at the clock...10:05. If you didn't know random people love coming to Blockbuster in the morning. Yeah, weird. I was thinking how ridiculous would it be if Mike, the district manager, was coming. She came back and what do you know? He's there with another district manager, Rick. I just laughed my ass off. I guess they had to come in because something happen with the inventory. So long story short, I was stuck running the BSI and ringing up customers, so I was super busy. It was great. I took my lunch and called Marco. Janis was kept rolling her eyes when one of the managers was talking,(not saying which one). That was hilarious. Overall people where being super nice today; I think it's because it's Friday.  Robb came in around 3. Let me tell you! I was running BSI, which just stands for the older movies. So I had my back turned, and I didn't see him come in. DAHHH! He comes up behind me and totally whispers,&amp;quot;hello.&amp;quot; I jumped and turned around. I normally have my hair down, but today felt like a ponytail kinda day. I'm glad it wasn't down though. He's so adorable.  Seanwas suppose to come in at 5, when I was getting off. It wasaround 4:45 and I'm like&amp;quot;hmm He's usually early.&amp;quot; Thensomeone calls and goes,&amp;quot;Kaily, who's on duty?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Uhhh, Robb, Janis, Keeyan. who is this?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It's Sean. Well can you tell Keeyan I'll be alittle late, I'm trying to keep my house fromburning down.&amp;quot; I burst out laughing while trying to say okay. Ah, I love Sean.  -retracking- Inventory was killer. Sean and Iwere there from 11pm to 7 am. It was rathertedious; scanning all the movies. Itwas agoodsquatting workout though. We were getting towards the endand Sean and I were meeting by the new releases. I go,&amp;quot;Sean can you get the top ones?&amp;quot; He laughed and said,&amp;quot;I'd love to.&amp;quot; Yeah, he laughed becauseI'm short. Blah. We then put everythingaway and are standing by the employee room. We looked at each other and go,&amp;quot;Good morning.&amp;quot; Oh yeah, I hadn't evennoticed the sun come out. I wasout by 7 am. Igot home about 7:20,showered, and was at my mom's job(my other job now) at 8 am. I didn't get off until 5pm. You better believed we got starbucks, but I was still so tired. It wasawesome, but I'll never do that again.- -resume-  Today thecustomers were great. I met someone who graduated from U of A. (I thought of Stina).I met this guywho moved here from Nebraska. Total cutie. He had themidwestern accent. I told himabout Kansas. He's like,&amp;quot;yeah it's the same old thing.&amp;quot; I said, &amp;quot;well, Vegas iscompletely different.&amp;quot; He laughed and said, &amp;quot;Oh yeah I noticed.&amp;quot;  And the check. Oh yes.First one was only $197. Thisone is $455. :D decent.               Send to a friend
