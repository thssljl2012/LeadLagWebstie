in the latest sign that localism is a coming force in British everyday life, Lewes will launch its own currency... The Lewes pound will initially be accepted in around 30 locally owned shops and a first run of 10,000-plus notes is expected. It is the largest-scale launch of a local currency in the UK since Lewes had its own pound in the 19th century and, in a coup for the organisers, the town&amp;#039;s branch of Barclays bank has agreed to accept it.
