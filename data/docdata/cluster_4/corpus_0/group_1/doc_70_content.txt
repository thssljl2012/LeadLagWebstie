I kind of enjoyed the duel between Vijay Singh and Sergio Garcia during the 2008 Barclays Championship this past Sunday. I know Kevin Sutherland was there too but it was cool to see VJ put in his birdie putt right on top of Sergio to prolong the playoff that VJ eventually won. Nice to see some emotion from some golf pros especially from VJ who goes about the course quite methodically. They're obviously friends and it was to bad someone had to lose. Made for some great TV watching. If you missed it check it out below.
