Hey everyone just to let everyone know, a fund has been set up in Ariel's name with Bank of America, if you or anyone you know would like to donate go into ANY Bank of America branch and tell them you would like to make a donation to the Ariel R. Anderson Medical Fund. Also sometime soon her Aunt Evelyn is planning a Car Wash for donations, so keep an ear &amp; eye out for that, will be posting as soon as we know more!Also Todd and I are trying to get a silent auction going to raise money as well, so if you or anyone you know has anything they would like to donate PLEASE let us know!!!! this can be anything, services, items, baskets you put together, offer to mow a lawn....ANYTHING!! :) The donations will help the family with the expenses that the insurance does NOT cover, and they all have a very long road ahead so any help, no matter how big or small will be greatly appreciated!!!!!! As Always, *Keeping the Faith*  Love ya allCathy/ Moms
