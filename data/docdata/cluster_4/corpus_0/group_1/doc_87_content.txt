 I am still in my pajamas and it is after 2pm, but you know what? AWESOME. I just feel the need to do absolutely nothing today, and it is amazing. No moving bags, or interviews about jobs, or anything like that. Just pure nothing. Geeking around on the laptop and watching old reruns on TV. It is blissful after the last week of crazy. It seems weird to think I haven't even been here a week yet! So anyway, Julie and I got to our friend Lynsey's house last night - exhausted, but brilliant. We have space! We have access to a washing machine and a TV, and the internet, and a shower... and a kitchen! I seriously can't wait until we have a place of our own. I will feel so much more settled then. Hopefully I can get something sorted on the job front shortly. I've got three 'potential' things lined up. I saw a guy yesterday - a prep for my actual interview with Barclays next week - he basically just told me what to expect, and how the interview is based (behavioural again, with a roleplay section, argh). I had to do a practise one with him and he pretended to be a pregnant woman called Jessica. It was... amusing. Either way, I'm going to try and do some prep for that before I go in - usually I wing that sort of stuff, but I figure I should at least try. So doing that on Wednesday, and I've passed the initial round of testing with the Ombudsman's office, so have to go in and do the second round of that on Wednesday too. Need to be on my game that day. As I've said before, arghh, job hunting. I HATE YOU.So I know at this stage, I'm going to be at Lynsey's for the next two weeks and hopefully I'll know where I am at on the job front by then too. More fun stuff:Robert Downey Jr. in Rolling Stone."Right now, my BlackBerry is literally overloading and crashing, and the phone is never not ringing," he says, hauling the damn thing out and turning it off. "It's crazy. Like a Super Bowl. Like a landslide. Like nothing I've ever experienced."

There have been a few scans floating around but not the whole thing in HQ. Boo.James McAvoy in Arena.Interview here                Okay, I'm going to go do something. I promise. Well, probably not. I'm going to go look up DVDs I want to buy instead.
