 It's been a busy week and I'm very, very tired. It'll get better.... Let's see....the last I updated, it was Tuesday? Wednesday, Ed held a "scrimmage" with 3 nearby schools that weren't in the 4A division, just to get some practice.  His top runner, Ty, came in first, although he had to fight to keep the lead.  Here are some pix of the run.... Cramp! Boys' start.... Ty, pushing.... ....and finishing......Ed's team did OK, but some of his better runners who had slacked off over the summer, were whomped.  Good!  They need the incentive to get off their buns and start practicing more. Thursday, my 8th graders finally launched their rockets.  Out of the 13, only one landed in an inaccessible place (the roof of the Bank of America) and one just completely disappeared!  I suspect the second ignition didn't go off in the rocket and momentum carried it a lot farther than it should have gone.  Where is it?  Krista's class came out to watch...      Shortly after that class, the 5th graders came in to test their paper airplanes.... After lunch, the 6th graders were allowed to put  California Red Worms into there terrarium, but not before they observed the behavior of the womr....  Matthew and Mark... My roses today....    It's been a long week and I'm very tired. Thank You, Lord.
