Every night I debate with myself whether to leave my mobile phone on or not.  My wife and I have children and close relatives who live in different time zones all over the world, from Hawaii to London.  And as a frequent international traveler, I often sleep in a hotel bed somewhere in Europe, the Middle East, or Asia.    Life is complicated enough, I think, without being awakened in the middle of the night by a business colleague who didnt know it was 2 am my time when he called.  Or what if I get a wrong number call at 3 in the morning?  Two weeks ago I awakened to the buzzing sound of my phone in vibrate mode, only to find that Verizon Wireless had chosen 4 in the morning to send me some text messages regarding two phone numbers I had sought from their Information line the previous day!  And my wife told me she discontinued her alerts from Bank of America for the same reason.            Every night I debate with myself whether to leave my mobile phone on or not.
