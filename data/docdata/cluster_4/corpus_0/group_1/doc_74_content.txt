Your evening commute might be somewhat worse today, because of signal issues at Franklin Avenue that are affecting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 lines.  The MTA says to expect delays on that line, and also reminds people that the "ongoing police investigation at West 42nd Street and 6th Avenue" (from the falling glass at the Bank of America building), the M42 and M104 buses are being re-routed.
