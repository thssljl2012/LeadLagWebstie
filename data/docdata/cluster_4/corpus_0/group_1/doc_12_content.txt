 in the end, i opted for lloyds tsb.  thanks for all your suggestions.  it was remarkably easy.  took about 40 minutes to set up.  barclays said it would take 6-8 weeks.  rubbish.  counted all the change i've been saving and had 6.85.  i really like that new neil diamond record.was struck by genius walking down the holloway road before and am going to add "look, i'll pay you for it, what the duck..." to the end of "smoked duck".  and am today leaning towards "everybody wants some" being the best rock song ever written (as opposed to 'panama' or 'unchained').
