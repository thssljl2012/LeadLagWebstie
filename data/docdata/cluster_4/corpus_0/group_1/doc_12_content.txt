For winning athletes, there is a long standing tradition of turning Olympic Gold into endorsement gold.  That intangible asset of favorable name recognition is a staple in advertising.  The same holds true for the venue itself, as the Chinese have come to realize (according to this story in today's Wall Street Journal - Seeking Post-Game Sponsors): For a price tag in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the manager of the "Bird's Nest" National Stadium is selling the 30-year rights to put a corporate name on the front of the Beijing Olympics' most prominent venue, as well as the rights to about 10 specific partnerships, such as soft drinks and technology, inside. Next door, Beijing's "Water Cube" Aquatic Center is also selling partnership rights, though so far only inside.  Selling off stadium naming rights is, of course, nothing new in the US.  Nor is this the first post-Olympic deal.  Last year, naming rights to the Sydney Olympic stadium were sold to ANZ Bank based on the deal's advertising potential (as the  Sydney Morning Herald explained): "This stadium is one of the world's great sporting and entertainment arenas and, because of the 2000 Olympics, holds a unique place in the hearts of all Australians," ANZ CEO Mike Smith said.  So this latest move by the Chinese is following in the grand Olympic tradition.  What it shows, however, is how sophisticated the Chinese are becoming with respect to intangible assets.
