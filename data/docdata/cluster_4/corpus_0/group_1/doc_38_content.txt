With the Wyndham over, it&amp;#8217;s time for the usual post-pickem post-mortem. I snagged the winner this week, which is always nice, and nine out of my 10 picks made the cut, which is also solid. A few more in the top 20 would have been nice, but you get what you get and you don&amp;#8217;t get upset&amp;#8230; Carl Pettersson: winner Briny Baird: T9 Kent Jones: T20 (My underdog sleeper pick played solidly. But not well enough to get into next week&amp;#8217;s playoffs, unfortunately.) Paul Casey: T26 David Toms: T41 Eric Axley: T41 Brandt Snedeker: T69 Dean Wilson: T69 Billy Mayfair: 78 Jeev M. Singh: missed cut Lefty Watch: Axley, with his T41, was the top southpaw this week. Tim Wilkinson finished T69, and Bubba Watson missed the cut. Next up, the start of the FedEx Cup Playoffs, with the Barclays. Four tournaments, as you know, leading up to the crowning of the FedEx Cup champion who gets a $10 million bonus. I gotta say, even though I&amp;#8217;m obviously a big golf fan&amp;#8211;who cares? The money can&amp;#8217;t buy drama. It&amp;#8217;s not like these guys desperately need another $10 million. Most likely the winner will be a multimillionaire who can find $10 million in the sofa cushions of his mansions. Well, hopefully some good golf will be played, and let&amp;#8217;s hope the winner manages to at least be a little excited when handed the big check.
