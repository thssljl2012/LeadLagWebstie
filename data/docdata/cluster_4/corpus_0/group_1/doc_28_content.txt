                My Treo 755 died last night about 14 months after my Treo 650 did. Both of these phones cost me more than $300. The first I erroneously thought I insured; the second I deliberately avoided insuring once I realized I'd just get someone else's reconditioned phone, probably the week after I receive either of the two $100-150 rebates I am owed on the aforementioned phones, which so far is NEVER.I curse the following: Sprint, who stole my rebates; Palm, who manufactured these pieces of shit; Lieutenant M, whose Treo died last week and clearly passed on to mine phone herpes; Bank of America, who, as my stockpiled cash on hand dipped below $30, finally sent me a replacement for my expired ATM card yesterday that REQUIRES YOU CALL FROM YOUR REGISTERED PHONE NUMBER FOR ACTIVATION; Nobody Girl, who was responsible for my original purchase after ordering me in no uncertain terms not to buy one and make her insane with jealousy. For the 93rd time - YOU WIN.
