 The Olympic Opening Ceremony last night? INCREDIBLY AWESOME. So stunning, and even better when you're watching them in HD on a big screen TV with surround sound, as I did. But nothing compares to seeing them in person, I'm sure. I'D LOVE TO DO THAT.Then, there was more awesomeness in the form of Kiefer himself confirming that he is the voice of those Bank of America commericals, proving that I CALLED IT AND a hilarious promo for The Office that makes me wish that September 25th wasn't so far away. I WANT IT TO BE HERE, LIKE, RIGHT NOW.
