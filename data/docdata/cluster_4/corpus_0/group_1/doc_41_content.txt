Cullen Jones is the second African American to win a gold medal at the Olympics. Jones, who was born in the Bronx, grew up in Irvington and trained in Newark, was motivated to learn swimming after almost drowning as a child. Now the gold medalist will become a role model to inspire others to learn the sport. From MSNBC.com...  Jones is just the third African-American to medal in an Olympic Games, and today, as the third leg of the relay that anchor Jason Lezak brought home in a dramatic finish, he became just the second to win gold.  Hours after his win, Bank of America announced they are going to sponsor his Cullen Jones Tour, a series of clinics and swim meets he is organizing in order to promote more children from minority backgrounds to get in the pool.
