Steve Smith is back with the Carolina Panthers, just in time to join a team full of confidence after a surprising 2-0 start.The receiver's two-game suspension for breaking teammate Ken Lucas' nose in a training camp fight ended Monday morning. He was seen leaving Bank of America Stadium around noon carrying two cardboard boxes and joking with defensive tackle Damione Lewis.Smith did not speak to reporters."He's ready to roll," coach John Fox said. "Obviously he's excited to be back and excited that we're 2-0."The Panthers insist they have gotten over the hard feelings created by Smith's sucker punch in camp. Smith slugged Lucas during a break in practice Aug. 1 while Lucas was on one knee with his helmet off.
