The tournament formerly known as the FedEx Kinko&amp;#8217;s Classic remains without a title sponsor, but there&amp;#8217;s reason for optimism. New potential sponsors have emerged recently, and tournament organizers say they haven&amp;#8217;t yet given up.  &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re going to go right down to the last minute,&amp;#8221; said Bryan Naugle, executive director of the Champions Tour event in Austin.  Earlier this year, FedEx ended its six-year title sponsorship of the 54-hole event at The Hills Country Club, leaving many to speculate that Time Warner would assume its spot. That didn&amp;#8217;t happen. The Time Warner deal soured for a variety of reasons, and the tournament&amp;#8217;s future looked dire until the end of the summer.  Naugle initially said his company, Prolinks Sports, which manages the tournament, would have to decide the future of the tournament by the end of August, by which time the Champions Tour wanted its tournaments confirmed so it could organize the official 2009 schedule. That date passed. But the tour, encouraged by Prolinks&amp;#8217; recent progress in preserving the tournament and hopeful of keeping a presence in the birthplace of the Legends of Golf, extended the deadline.  &amp;#8220;We want to return to Austin,&amp;#8221; Naugle said. &amp;#8220;The players want to return to Austin. The tour wants to return to Austin.&amp;#8221;  If the tournament survives, it will be scheduled for early June instead of its traditional late-April/early-March slot, Naugle added.  &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;ve lost the spot we had,&amp;#8221; he said.  Meanwhile, other Champions Tour tournaments find themselves in similar circumstances, the Sports Business Journal reported yesterday:  The Champions Tour will drop one event from its schedule in 2009 and could lose up to four more if title sponsors are not found.  The Turtle Bay Championship in Hawaii will not return next year because Oak Tree Capital, the company that owns the resort and paid to run the event, is selling the property.  Bank of America, FedEx and MasterCard previously announced they would not renew their respective deals in Boston; in Austin, Texas; and at the tour&amp;#8217;s other stop in Hawaii, after this year&amp;#8217;s events. Each said its long-term sponsorship had run its course.  Commerce Bank was originally signed to sponsor the Long Island event through 2009, but exercised an out clause to avoid competing with the 2009 U.S. Open at nearby Bethpage State Park, a tour executive said.  Industry sources said the four open tournaments are seeking three- to five-year deals worth $2 million to $4 million annually.  Directors for the Austin, Boston and Hawaii events said they were still meeting with potential sponsors. Each played down the effect of the lagging economy and expressed optimism about finding replacements despite having only about one month to do so.  &amp;#8220;We are still talking with a couple companies and we&amp;#8217;re hopeful we&amp;#8217;ll get something done,&amp;#8221; said Tracy West, director of the Boston event. Directors in Austin and Hawaii echoed her comment.  Hawaii will likely return with or without a title sponsor because it is owned by the PGA Tour&amp;#8217;s Championship Management group, which could help fund operations.  The status of the Long Island event could not be determined. Tournament organizers did not return phone messages, and the Champions Tour did not make anyone available for comment.  There will be at least one new Champions Tour event next year. A formal announcement is expected soon that First Data will title sponsor a new event in Atlanta.
