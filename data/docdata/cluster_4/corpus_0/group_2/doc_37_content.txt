     Myrtle Beach resident Dustin Johnson finally has another opportunity to tee it up in a PGA Tour event. Johnson hasn't been eligible to play since missing the cut Aug. 22 in The Barclays, the first FedEx Cup playoff event, and it will have been 27 days between tournament rounds when he tees off Thursday in the opening round of the Viking Classic at Annandale Golf Club in Madison, Miss. The tournament has a $3.6 million purse with a winning share of $648,000. Johnson can use any of that purse as he attempts to retain his card. After a quick start to the year, Johnson has fallen to the precarious position of 125th on the money list with $621,605 earned. The top 125 retain their exempt playing privileges for 2009, and he's a little more than $4,000 ahead of Rich Beem in 126th. Six official events remain following next week's Tour Championship. Golf Channel will air tape-delayed coverage of the Viking Classic, being played concurrently with the Ryder Cup, from 8-10 p.m. Thursday through Sunday.
