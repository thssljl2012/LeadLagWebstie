Australian golfers get to compete as a team in the President's Cup against the US along with the other best golfers in the world who aren't from Europe or the US. It's a nice competition but still a little too "nice" for my liking. With the Ryder Cup on the agenda this month between Europe and the USA it's easy to know who most of us will be pulling for (please vote on the right in the poll) but hypothetically, if we had our own 12 man team, who'd be in it?With more Australians on the PGA Tour than any other country other than the US,we'd have a reasonable team that would fair ok, as long as the tournament isn't played at Augusta. I suppose the first 10 players would qualify according to world golf ranking. They've been listed below to have a look at, with those in bold automatically qualifying. The big question would be, if you were team captain, what two players would be your wild card inclusions?I'd put Matthew Goggin in for sure. His form last week was excellent finishing 4th at the Barclays but his 8 Top 25 finishes this year with 3 Top 10's would make him a good pick. The last pick isn't so clear but I'd go with a risky Jason Day. Not risky because he lacks talent but risky cause on his first year on the tour, he's still showing a lot of inconsistency.Anyone disagree.Similar posts:  golf ball
