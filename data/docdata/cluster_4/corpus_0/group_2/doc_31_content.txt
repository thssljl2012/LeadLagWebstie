 Date: Saturday 20th September Kick Off: 15.00 Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez hopes full-back Fabio Aurelio recovers from a calf injury to face Stoke having failed to make the midweek trip to Marseille.  Andrea Dossena was a less than convincing alternative at left-back in France, while Benitez must also decide whether to recall Robbie Keane to partner striker Fernando Torres. Xabi Alonso will contest a midfield role with Lucas and veteran defender Sami Hyypia may be brought in to help contest Stoke&amp;#8217;s now famed long throws from Rory Delap. Winger Albert Riera, who made his debut in last weekend&amp;#8217;s victory over Manchester United, could replace Ryan Babel. Benitez paid tribute to much-criticised Premier League new-boys Stoke but warned: &amp;#8220;We have the best midfield player in the world.&amp;#8221; Benitez&amp;#8217;s unbeaten Reds face Tony Pulis&amp;#8217; promoted Potters at Anfield intent on strengthening their position in the Barclays Premier League table, ahead of the clash between rivals Chelsea and Manchester United 24 hours later. But Stoke have already embarrassed several of their new top-flight colleagues, and Benitez insists they will have to be on their guard against Delap&amp;#8217;s massive long throws. But with skipper Steven Gerrard needing one goal to reach a club century, Benitez has faith in the player he believes is the world&amp;#8217;s best to lead Liverpool to victory. Only Amdy Faye (suspended) and the injured Andrew Davies will be absent for Stoke. Both players missed Sunday&amp;#8217;s defeat by Everton and Pulis&amp;#8217; main selection headache may concern whether to move Abdoulaye Faye back into defence after he played as a midfield anchor last weekend. Glenn Whelan will be hoping for a recall to the Stoke midfield following his fine performances for the Republic of Ireland and he could get the nod at Leon Cort&amp;#8217;s expense if Faye is switched. Danny Higginbotham has played in a winning Southampton side at Liverpool and he will strain every sinew in an attempt to repeat the experience with Stoke. It is almost five years since Higginbotham was in the Saints team which came away from Anfield with a shock 2-1 victory, courtesy of goals by Brett Ormerod and Thomas Svensson. A late reply from Emile Heskey could not save Gerard Houllier&amp;#8217;s side and defender Higginbotham&amp;#8217;smemories of the occasion remain crystal clear.   The Beautiful Game&amp;#8217;s Verdict: 2-0 Best Bet 1st Goal Scorer: Gerrard
