Saturday 27 September 2008 12:45, Barclays Premier LeagueRafael Benitez has named the same side that drew with Stoke City for the 208th Merseyside derby at Goodison Park this afternoon. The Reds boss stands by the starting XI who were frustrated by the Barclays Premier League newcomers last weekend after Javier Mascherano and Yossi Benayoun were both ruled out through injury. It means Xabi Alonso will partner skipper Steven Gerrard at the heart of the midfield with Robbie Keane and Fernando Torres again paired up front.  The Liverpool team in full: Reina - Arbeloa, Carragher, Skrtel, Dossena - Kuyt, Alonso, Gerrard, Riera - Keane, TorresSubs: Cavalieri, Agger, Hyypia, Aurelio, Pennant, Babel, Lucas
