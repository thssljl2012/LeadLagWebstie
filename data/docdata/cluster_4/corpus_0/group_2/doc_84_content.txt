  Bentley's intent David Bentley summed up the determined mood of the players ahead of tonight's Villa clash by insisting: &amp;quot;It's time to get results.&amp;quot;   We step back into action in the Barclays Premier League fully 15 days after an impressive 1-1 draw against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Since then, three new players have arrived - Russian international striker Roman Pavlyuchenko from Spartak Moscow, Croatian international defender Vedran Corluka from Manchester City and England Under-21 international striker Fraizer Campbell on loan from Manchester United. Villa will provide a stern test but Bents' feels we have to deliver on home soil. &amp;quot;Villa have a lot of pace and some good young players, good English players who work well as a team,&amp;quot; reasoned the midfielder. &amp;quot;They are always difficult to play against but it's time to start getting results.  &amp;quot;We have to stay compact, be tough to beat and play our game. We have the players, we have the ability and we shouldn't worry about the opposition too much. &amp;quot;We should go out there, play our game and take it from there.&amp;quot; It's the first game of a busy spell of five matches in 13 days - a run that includes our return to UEFA Cup action against against Polish side Wisla Krakow and the start of our defence of the Carling Cup at Newcastle. In fact, we face seven matches in 20 days before the next international break. &amp;quot;This is when we need to start playing,&amp;quot; added David. &amp;quot;If we get out there, play well and beat Villa it will kick-start us for the rest of this busy period. It's all about playing well and getting the right result.&amp;quot; Tottenhamhotspur.com - News Articles - Bentley's intent
