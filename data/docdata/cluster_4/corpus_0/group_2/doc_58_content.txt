What's going on with your team A?The richest team ever is killing its fans with ever-increasing ticket prices and, well, the fans just aren't gonna take it anymore.The first Championship team to charge 50 pounds a seat.The 50 ticket is still less than Londons Barclays Premier League clubs, with Arsenal (96), Chelsea (65), Tottenham (75), West Ham (63) and Fulham (70) charging more for top-priced tickets to category A games.But it is more expensive than every other top-flight team, except Manchester United, who charge only 5 more for the best seats to top fixtures.Dang, that's a lot of duckets.
