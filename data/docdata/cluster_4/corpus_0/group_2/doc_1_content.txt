One thing I note in passing is this:As an American taxpayer I now have a stake in the insurance-and-whatthefuck corporate giant AIG.As such, I become a sort of proxy majority sponsor of the English Premier League club Manchester United.Problem?  I loathe ManUre and the other "big four" Premiership clubs for being the cash-bloated frontrunners that are.  It's not that they're not good.  It's not that I wouldn't give a nut to get MY favorite English club (Norwich City) into the UEFA Champions' League.  But not at the price of becoming an ugly corporate monster like the big English clubs.Dear God, what a horrible choice.  Support the red devils and become just another silverware-walloping ManU lover?  Or continue to pray for "Norwich and whoever's playing United!"Naow - fuck them Scum...On the ball, City!!
