    Quote:                  Harry Redknapp insists restoring his players&amp;#039; confidence levels has been the key to Tottenham Hotspur&amp;#039;s stunning revival. Spurs moved off the foot of the Barclays Premier League table with a 2-1 victory over title contenders Liverpool secured by Roman Pavlyuchenko&amp;#039;s last minute winner. Redknapp said: &amp;amp;quot;I have just got in amongst the players, talked to them and tried to be a part of them. I have encouraged them. I have always said everything in life is about confidence. If I am playing golf and I go to the first tee and play a poor shot the chances are I will have a bad round. If I can hit a good shot then my confidence will be high and football is the same. It&amp;#039;s better to keep telling people what they can do well rather than what they can&amp;#039;t do well. That&amp;#039;s all I&amp;#039;m trying to do with them.&amp;amp;quot;                 Premier League football news from the Barclays Premier League
