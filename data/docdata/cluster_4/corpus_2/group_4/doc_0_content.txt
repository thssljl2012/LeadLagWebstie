         Levy launches Berbatov attack      Daniel Levy has attacked Dimitar Berbatov for treating Tottenham Hotspur with disrespect, telling the striker that the club put him on the footballing map.   Tottenham chairman Levy is still bitter over Berbatov&amp;#039;s summer transfer saga to Manchester United after the Bulgaria international refused to play in the Barclays Premier League matches against Sunderland and Chelsea.  &amp;amp;quot;We had a player who had refused to play two games for us, having a detrimental affect on the dressing-room,&amp;amp;quot; said Levy. &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;#039;d known for a year that the player had wanted out of this club.&amp;amp;quot;  Levy revealed that Berbatov wanted to move to Old Trafford one year after arriving from Bayer Leverkusen.  &amp;amp;quot;We were very disappointed,&amp;amp;quot; Levy said.  &amp;amp;quot;Dimitar Berbatov was a player who we brought to this club at a time when Man Utd were interested in him. He made a conscious decision to come to this club, we invested a lot of money, nobody had ever heard of Dimitar Berbatov when we bought him.  &amp;amp;quot;A year later with 10 days to go to the end of the window he tells us he wants to leave to go to Manchester United.&amp;amp;quot;  Levy feels Berbatov&amp;#039;s conduct then - and a year later when he eventually moved for 30million - amounted to treating Tottenham with contempt.  &amp;amp;quot;I don&amp;#039;t think he treated this club with the respect that we honestly deserved,&amp;amp;quot; he added.  &amp;amp;quot;We put him on the map, I think he&amp;#039;s an outstanding player, but he signed a long-term contract with this club and I think he should have stayed.  &amp;amp;quot;I had so many conversations with him. He kept saying it was about his ambition to play for Manchester United. It wasn&amp;#039;t a money issue. We offered him a new contract and he wasn&amp;#039;t even interested in discussing it.&amp;amp;quot;      ESPNsoccernet
