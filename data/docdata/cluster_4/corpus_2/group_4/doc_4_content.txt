         Blackburn v Chelsea: Preview      Blackburn are set to be without leading strikers Benni McCarthy and Roque Santa Cruz for Chelsea&amp;#039;s visit. McCarthy is suspended while Santa Cruz is a major doubt with a calf tear.  Brett Emerton (hamstring) is also out while his fellow Australian Vince Grella is another doubt, also with a hamstring injury.  Striker Jason Roberts is aiming to prove a point against Chelsea once more.  Roberts was released by the London club as a teenager and had to fight his way through the Football League ranks to become an established top-flight striker.  He said: &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s special for me playing them, because I was on the books at Chelsea from 14 through to 16 but I just missed out on a contract - which was a blow to me at the time.  &amp;amp;quot;My first Blackburn goal was against Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final in 2007 at Old Trafford.  &amp;amp;quot;I remember the occasion - it was fantastic. But I always look back at that game with disappointment, because I felt we had a great chance to win it - but that&amp;#039;s football.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  Roberts has also promised John Terry another physical challenge at Ewood Park - the England captain has admitted in the past that he finds the 30-year-old as much of a handful as any other striker in the Premier League.  Roberts added: &amp;amp;quot;He&amp;#039;s a good player. We always have a tussle, and long may it continue. I hope I come out on the winning side this time.  &amp;amp;quot;Chelsea, for me, are playing football as well as anyone in Europe at the moment.  &amp;amp;quot;It will be a big test for us. They are a really good side with some great players. But that is what you play football for - it is what you are in the Premier League for, so you&amp;#039;ve got to look forward to these games.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  Chelsea left-back Ashley Cole will miss the trip with a calf problem.  Wayne Bridge will continue to deputise for Cole, but defender Ricardo Carvalho (hamstring) and midfielders Michael Ballack (foot) and Michael Essien (knee) remain out.  Brazilian defensive midfielder Mineiro has been added to the squad and the 33-year-old could make his first start in the Barclays Premier League match.  Chelsea boss Luiz Felipe Scolari knows his side face a tough battle against Blackburn after expressing his surprise at the physical nature of the Premier League.  The rough and tumble of England&amp;#039;s top flight was thrown into the spotlight last week when Arsenal were beaten by Stoke.  Gunners boss Arsene Wenger hinted that some Stoke players sought to injure his squad during the encounter - a claim forcefully denied by Potters boss Tony Pulis.  But while Scolari accepts that the Premier League is extremely combative he does not believe the safety of the players is at risk.  &amp;amp;quot;Yes, sometimes the games are more physical than I was expecting,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; admitted Scolari.  &amp;amp;quot;Sometimes we need to adapt to sides that are much bigger than our players. Sometimes teams play with more physical contact, but not to injure someone.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  Meanwhile Portugal midfielder Deco has admitted he is struggling to rediscover his best form after having an impressive start to his Chelsea career interrupted by a hip injury.  The Portugal midfielder was named August&amp;#039;s player of the month by the Premier League, but hasn&amp;#039;t been fully fit since limping off in the warm-up before the game against Manchester United in September.  Deco, who joined Chelsea from Barcelona for 7.9million in the summer, then missed a month of the campaign and has not made the same impact following his return to the first team six games ago.  He said: &amp;amp;quot;The injury came at a bad time because I was playing well and I was in good condition physically, but injuries never come when you want them to.  &amp;amp;quot;I am progressing, but I need more games before I am feeling 100%. I have had a few problems, I am trying to progress day by day.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  The 31-year-old will be more determined than anyone to help the team get back to winning ways at Blackburn after being sent off during the 3-1 Champions League defeat to Roma in midweek.  He signed a two-year contract at Stamford Bridge and feels his dip in form is only temporary.  He added: &amp;amp;quot;I don&amp;#039;t know how good I will be playing in three years but if I continue doing well I think I can do some important things for Chelsea. I don&amp;#039;t feel old and I think I have three or four more years at the top.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      ESPNsoccernet
