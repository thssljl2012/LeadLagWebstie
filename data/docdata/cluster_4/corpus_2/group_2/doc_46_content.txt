 Yup, FA said something like if they were going to extend the ban they&amp;#039;d have to bring new charges or some shite like that.  Glad Terry&amp;#039;s ban was overturned, it should&amp;#039;ve been a yellow but I didn&amp;#039;t know you can&amp;#039;t downgrade a red to a yellow so that&amp;#039;s news to me. All the top 4 would&amp;#039;ve gotten away with that, it&amp;#039;s typical really.  If I could be arsed I&amp;#039;d go find a load of quotes from the Spuds fans fapping over their attacking midfielders. I feel so justified in my lol&amp;#039;ing back then
