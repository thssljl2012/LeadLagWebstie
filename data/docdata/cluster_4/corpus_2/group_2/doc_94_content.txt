But hoping we win the next 3 games, Man City will be a tough one though as they&amp;amp;#039;re on fire.   i think they will play into our hands in this game.  they have signed a couple of good players, no more than that, and i think they feel they are better than they actually are - and will look to beat us. they did it to chelsea and got picked off. hopefully the same happens with us.
