          Lots of people say we&amp;amp;#039;ll fall to Chelsea, but I don&amp;amp;#039;t believe so. True, the game can go either way, but they only played the last 20 min against the Mancs in their own park, and we outplayed the Mancs. We seem to be pumped up for the big games, and I can&amp;amp;#039;t see us losing this one. Having said that, we are more likely to throw away the City game though... And the Bitters are unpredictable.
