 Hull deserve a lot of credit, Myhill was good when he needed to be, the defense was brave if not always competent, they kept possession well, they looked to win by attacking and they never even time wasted at 2-1 up. Cousin is my pick for man of the match and what a goal by Geovanni.  With the exception of Eboue, nobody rose above erratic or average for Arsenal and when you can&amp;#039;t control the ball (Cesc, Walcott among others), concede from a set peice and rely on an own goal to score, we deserved to lost. Abysmal
