    quote  ConkerASkyJockey    Never said Pennant had a good shot in him.     quote  ConkerASkyJockey    Pennant is a way better crosser and  shooter  then Kuyt. He also has a better foot for shots and handling the ball.    quote  ConkerASkyJockey    Or it&amp;#039;s because Rafa loves Kuyt too much to even bother with Pennant? I know he&amp;#039;s a greedy cnut but at least he can cross,  shoot  and has the pace for being your right winger.  You said it twice there    &amp;amp; Kuyt gets stuck in! Pennant is rather negligent of his defensive duties.
