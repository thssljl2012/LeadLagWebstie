   quote   Audacity     Because you were saying it like Man Utd get a lot of decisions at Old Trafford. Thus obviously referring to past incidents.  Which is true, but it was brought on by an event happening at the time, thus my post. Regardless of my own club&amp;#039;s history, I think it&amp;#039;s childish to just try and nullify that fact purely because the same can be said for another team? It doesn&amp;#039;t negate the decision, and that&amp;#039;s how I felt he was trying to come across.    quote  You cannot expect to say something without a reaction. A smelly old man could point out another smelly old man and say &amp;quot;he is a smelly old man.&amp;quot; The person he has stated this to could then turn to him and say &amp;quot;yes he is. As are you.&amp;quot; It was perhaps not expected, but equally valid and is a fair point to make.   But in that example, bot are smelly old men in the here and now. Today it was just the United game where a shit decision occured in their favour.   And seeing Gio&amp;#039;s goals made me a little bit more up beat considering how unstoppable it was. The header was pretty unstoppable too, unless Fabby grew another foot or we had some defenders who knew how to defend set pieces.
