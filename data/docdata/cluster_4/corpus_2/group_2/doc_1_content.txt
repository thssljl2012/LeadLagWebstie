   quote   DeNiro       quote   Venne     Cracking atmosphere at the Bridge today. We totally dominated United in the second half, about from the odd counter attack that United had. Didn&amp;#039;t see Berbatov apart from the goal, surprised he didnt get subbed. Anelka was so crap, i aint seen the replays yet but that miss in the 6 yard box was awful. Just wondering if it deflected of Rio.    quote   Archimonde_STG     WTF? Kalou pushed Ferdinand before scoring what a *bleep*ing cheater. We should have won, Chelsea looked weak in attack never got nervous besides the 2 Cole chances.     You should of won? If the game was 20 minutes long then yeh, but seroiusly, was you watching the same game as me? Oh and calling us cheaters is abit pathetic, when you&amp;#039;ve got people like Ronaldo diving all over the place.   You can&amp;#039;t even talk about cheaters when you have Michael Essien the &amp;quot;man&amp;quot; who assults people and pretends he&amp;#039;s hurt.   Assaults people   K. Nothing wrong with being physical, he might take it over the top sometimes but it aint cheating.   edit; City 6-0 up.
