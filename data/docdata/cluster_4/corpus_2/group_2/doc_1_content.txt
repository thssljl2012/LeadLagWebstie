Rarely in the history of football has it been more inappropriate to ignore world events and continue with a fixture as in the case of last nights match between United and Villareal.    The turmoil surrounding AIG Insurance earlier in the week was a hardly good platform for the players attempting to prepare for last nights game. They had barely recovered from the strain of the high-level negotiations between AIG and Bank of America when they were forced to tackle this very tricky Champions League opening match. This was especially hard on newcomer Dimitar Berbatov who had to be briefed from top to bottom on Uniteds and AIGs partnership whilst simultaneously trying to get to grips with Uniteds on-field tactical strategies. Even Top Legal professionals would struggle to take in this volume of information in such a small timeframe!    And lets not forget Christiano Ronaldo. All this could not have come at a worse time for him  returning from injury and also still finding his way around US and UK financial systems. A bit of leeway from UEFA, the Bank of England and The US Federal Reserve to allow the fixture to be moved would have been a small ask  but these organisations only care about profits.
