 But a fair proportion of blame can be put on Bentley. In the Premiership the wingers are of increasing importance and more often than not can decide the outcome of a game. When you&amp;#039;ve got quality wingers like Walcott, Young, Ronaldo, Petrov, Arteta on the top of their game, it really reflects on the rest of the teams performance - but likewise, poor wing-play can just stifle the rest of the team. Fair enough if Bentley was getting in the crosses and nobody is picking up on them, but his delivery and wing-play has just been poor in general.  He&amp;#039;s clearly got an arrogant streak to him as well, as was evidenced by his refusal to play for the England U21 team a few years back.
