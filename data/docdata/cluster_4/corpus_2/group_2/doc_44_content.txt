   quote   Venne       quote   The Realest      They say it every year!    &amp;quot;We are trying to win every competition&amp;quot;  Thats what he said, which is good. United just lack ambition if they aren&amp;#039;t trying for all four.    I think another way he is saying, is that we are taking the Carling Cup rather seriously which i&amp;#039;m glad. Since we walked with no trophies last year   after challenging all 4 (maybe not the fa cup but we had a high chance, as all the other top 4 was knocked out by then)
