   quote   D I O S       quote   Mycon     Yeah, the Ronaldo penalty was not a dive, if anyone says it is a dive you are only saying that because it is Ronaldo.   It&amp;#039;s not a dive but once he&amp;#039;s going over he makes the most of it, look at the combined arm and leg flick having been touched!  The thing is though, Styles cheated! He is a top 2 arse-licker, and if possible will give them every possible decision there is. Whether this is because he is scared of Ferguson or that he is just a *bleep* is irrelevant, he cheated and that&amp;#039;s whats pissing off most people.  Also if Ronaldo was feeling truly graceful he&amp;#039;d have passed it into Jussi&amp;#039;s arms I don&amp;#039;t care if he didn&amp;#039;t celebrate, he majorly profited from an incorrect decision that he KNEW was incorrect therefore bring the game into disrepute!   Like its been said already it was the referee who made the bad decision, Ronaldo did nothing, didn&amp;#039;t even try to call for a penalty. Ronaldo isn&amp;#039;t going to intentionally miss a penalty because it shouldn&amp;#039;t have been, its rare that a player would.
