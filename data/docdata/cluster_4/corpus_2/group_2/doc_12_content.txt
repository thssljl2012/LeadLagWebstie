   quote   ConkerASkyJockey      Or it&amp;#039;s because Rafa loves Kuyt too much to even bother with Pennant? I know he&amp;#039;s a greedy cnut but at least he can cross, shoot and has the pace for being your right winger.     True I reckon we should give him another run in the first team. Not a big fan of his but I don&amp;#039;t think we gave him a chance.
