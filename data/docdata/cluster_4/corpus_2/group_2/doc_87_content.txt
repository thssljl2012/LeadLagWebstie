          After watching Chelsea vs Manu I am not sure if they got as much pace in the game as we got. Maybe thats the reason why Keane got his problems fitting in the game. And maybe its the reason why we miss a lot of opportunities.   After the first rounds I reckon WE play the most powerful football in the league and I am curious to see how Chelsea answer to this might be.   I think we will have more problems with&amp;amp;nbsp; teams defending with 10 players in the box then with Chelsea or City, that might want to keep the game open.  Well see.   15 points
