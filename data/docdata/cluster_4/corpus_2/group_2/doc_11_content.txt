           Barring anything exceptional during the final round of the Deutsche Bank, my 4 captain&amp;#039;s picks would be:   1. Stricker (9th on cup list, finished 2nd at Mercedes, reputation for being good putter, imploded at the Barclays.)   2. Trahan (11th on list, won the Hope, leader among cup hopefuls at Deutsche Bank.)   3. Holmes (17th on list, won FBR, shot himself into and out of contention   at PGA, missed cut at Deutsche Bank, among birdie avg leaders on tour,   Daly-esque driver of the ball.)   4. Verplank (33rd on list, accurate driver of the ball, good cup record,   no top 3s this year.)      A quick comment about the EURO selections. THE EUROS always win no matter what side issues surround the team. However I would&amp;#039;ve selected Clarke over Poulter. Clarke   didn&amp;#039;t have a particularly good year and his only win was just before the final selection.   However he makes a proven and formidable duo with Lee Westwood.
