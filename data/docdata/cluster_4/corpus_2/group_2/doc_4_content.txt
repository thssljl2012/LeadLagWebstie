Barclays Premiership 2008/09 - Win Outright     Liverpool 13/2        Barclays Premiership To Finish In Top 4 2008/09 - Win Outright     Aston Villa 9/2        Both worth a fiver imo                       If you hate money, then yes they are. I wouldn&amp;#039;t start backing either until it drifted to 20 / 1 or more.
