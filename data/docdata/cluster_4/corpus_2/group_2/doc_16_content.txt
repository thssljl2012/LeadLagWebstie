 Had 3 of my 6 picks in the Top 10 last week. We&amp;#039;re gettin close but we just need someone other than Vijay winning. What can you say about Sergio as well. He&amp;#039;s in it every week and could easily win this week. No value with those guys though. I&amp;#039;m going with 4 guys this week to win. Risking .2 to each...     Jim Furyk (20-1)  - T12 at the Barclays and T7 in the Deutsche bank in the last two tourneys. He&amp;#039;s only had 2 years in his career without a win and he&amp;#039;s knocking at the door.      Justin Leonard (28-1)  - T7 in both the Barclays and Deutsche Bank. he&amp;#039;s playing very well and could win at a bit of a price     Hunter Mahan (50-1)  - He faded to T31 in the barclays after gunnig out to an early lead after 2 rounds i believe. he shot a very low score in the 1st and 2nd round. He followed that up with a t15 in the deutsche Bank. he was just named to the Ryder Cup team and he should be pumped about that     Chad Campbell (58-1)  - Another guy just named to the US Ryder cup team. He&amp;#039;s had some good results since the US Open and beyond. he&amp;#039;s been top 10 in 3 of 8 starts     good luck
