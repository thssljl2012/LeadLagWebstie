   quote   Number_26     He has been playing well, its just i dont want Drogba coming off and Kalou is playing good too, and i&amp;#039;d prefer Kalou &amp;amp;gt; Malouda.  That, and i&amp;#039;d also like Sinclair to get a run       Drogba looks a little tired anyways. He did against Man Utd.  He needs more time I agree, but I can&amp;#039;t be bothered if he&amp;#039;s not going to be able to score as that&amp;#039;s what we need from him. Goals!  Personally I think we should buy a new striker in January or next year.
