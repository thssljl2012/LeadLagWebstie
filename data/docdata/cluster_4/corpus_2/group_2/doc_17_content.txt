 We have a relatively easy fixture list for October so we should be far more    positive than we are. All of the below games are winnable. Bolton, West    Brom and Hull are games that we should definitely be winning at home.       Everton is our favourite away day as we win around 80% of our matches at    Goodison. Blackburn away is tough but I expect at least a draw there. West    ham have been a bogey team in recent seasons but they&amp;#039;re due a thrashing off us.       We&amp;#039;ve also got Ronaldo back and Berbatov will have had another week to gel   with the rest of the players. We&amp;#039;ve got our two toughest away games out of    the way as has been mentioned already. And we&amp;#039;ve actually played good    football in the opening 20 minutes of our last two games, we just need to    carry it on thought 90 minutes, which will be far easier against lesser opposition.
