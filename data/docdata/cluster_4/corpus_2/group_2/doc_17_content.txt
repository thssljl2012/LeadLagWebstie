 How does Ramos expect the team to gel when the teams&amp;#039; players are changed 5/6 times each match? There is no cohesion.  You could have scored the penalty Jmste, but you still wouldn&amp;#039;t have won. No one really looked interested. Lennon was a threat in spells, but he&amp;#039;s too inconsistent to rely on all the time.
