 Pennant is a disgusting excuse for a footballer. He stood out in a relegated Birmingham side &amp;amp; got a move to Liverpool from it! &amp;amp; he has looked out of place ever since!   It was his crosses that made him stand out at Birmingham, yet I dont think Ive seen more than a handful of his crosses beat the first man!  Personally, I would never include him in a Liverpool squad again! Hopefully offload him in January!!
