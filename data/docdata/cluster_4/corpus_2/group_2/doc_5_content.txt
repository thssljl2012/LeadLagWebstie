 Excellent news:       Fernando Torres has followed Steven Gerrard into the Anfield treatment room and out of the international action as Liverpool followed their stuttering progress into the group phase of the Champions League with an unconvincing goalless draw away to Aston Villa yesterday.      The Spain striker will have a scan today on a damaged hamstring that could make him a doubt for Liverpool&amp;amp;#8217;s next Barclays Premier League match, at home to Manchester United on September 13, and their opening Champions League group D encounter away to Marseilles three days later.  He is ruled out of his country&amp;amp;#8217;s World Cup qualifiers against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Armenia over the next ten days , although Rafael Bentez, the Liverpool manager who expects to conclude the 8 million signing of Albert Riera from Espanyol today, believes that he may be out for ten days
