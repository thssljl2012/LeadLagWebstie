   quote   Chelsea Boi       quote   Venne     Not looking foward to stoke tbh  . They kept Liverpool out but i think we have a better chance of breaking there defence. I heard somewhere that they have the biggest defence in the prem? Which would certainly make Drogba less affective.     Drogba&amp;#039;s got a lot of strengh though. They could be big, but weak.   Use Anelka because his pace would help a lot.  I think we can get a good win against Stoke. Hopefully Deco will be back by then        Anelka could of the pace of Usain Bolt and it wouldn&amp;#039;t make up for his finishing   Anelka used to be a composed finisher but since he&amp;#039;s being at Chelsea we ain&amp;#039;t seen any of that.  Hoping for Di Santo &amp;amp; Kalou to get a chance against Pompey in the CC. Hopefully Kalou will impress against Pompey and gets picked for the Stoke game because i think having somebody with pace down the wings could be key for the Stoke game.  Edit; Decos out for 2 weeks and Carvalho is out for 3-4 weeks. Not to bad for Carvalho, thought it was going to be 5 months or so.     This message was edited by Venne on Sep 22 2008.
