     quote  DjedwardSmith    Not all Liverpool fans live in Liverpool  Demographically, you may just have the views of people who live there  Therefore you cannot categorically cannot say that Liverpool fans have not been saying that. As I&amp;#039;ve spoken to at least seven who think that.  My point was that I had spoken to more Liverpool fans on the situation than you        quote  DjedwardSmith    Wow. A Liverpool fan with a little bit of common sense. I&amp;#039;m stunned. There&amp;#039;s a difference between hope, and stupidity. At least you&amp;#039;re on the hopeful side on that one.  Coming from an Arsenal fan thats rich!    quote  Venne    Its 4 Games, your no closer imo.  I think we are closer for the simple fact that we actually beat one of the other &amp;quot;big&amp;quot; teams, which we failed to do last year!  Its hard work responding to all these comments
