   quote   Nel4Life       quote   cambiasso     Gomes is a clown. He has the size, and all the attributes a goalkeeper could need yet he is shite. No keeper should make that much mistakes in so little time.   Pardon? Gomes has been quality apart from ONE mistake. Aside from that he&amp;#039;s been top-class.   Two mistakes...the one where he let Youngs shot go underneath him and today.
