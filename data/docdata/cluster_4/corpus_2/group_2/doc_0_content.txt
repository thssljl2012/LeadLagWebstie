The Christies, who are no strangers to helping people in need, have graciously used their star appeal to bring awareness to the issue.     This past Monday, Wall Street took a beating after a series of historic events that included the bankruptcy of a major investment bank, and the sale of another and the near collapse of one of the most iconic of blue-chip companies. AIG is the largest insurance company world-wide. As the economy is reaching an all time low, the Christies felt that it was time they help to bring the crisis much needed attention, so that fellow Americans can pull together to help one another battle through this urgent situation.     &amp;quot;We encourage all our fellow men and woman to buy at least two stocks to help with the global economic crisis,&amp;quot; said Jackie Christie. &amp;quot;We want everyone to step up and help in any way that they can. This is a huge crisis we face, but together we can make a difference. Do not just sit by and watch.&amp;quot;     The Christies are no strangers to bringing worthy causes to the limelight such as bringing awareness to HIV/AIDS foundations and promoting the foundation of marriage and family through their books and public appearances. They know how fortunate they are to have the life they have and want to use their star presence in bringing awareness to the crisis we face.     &amp;quot;I want other celebrities to come on board and use their media power to bring attention to this crisis, and help promote the need to come together, because this affects all of us,&amp;quot; said Doug Christie.     The couple plan on helping not only by purchasing shares, but also by establishing a financial workshop to help bring awareness to the today&amp;#039;s financial crisis.
