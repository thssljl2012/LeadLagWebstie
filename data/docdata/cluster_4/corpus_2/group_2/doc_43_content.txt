    Mike B:      MATEO:      SteveManics:  Funny how the United supporters are being gracious in defeat and admitting Liverpool deserved to win, yet &amp;#039;fans&amp;#039; like Neil, Pablo and Mateo feel the need to talk crap and slag us off.  Ah well, every side has its share of arsehole fans  you may be gracious...but not all of you. and us usual liverpool lot of fans are always, USUALLY, gracious in defeat...ie, chelsea in champs leage this year, man u beating us constantly.     And just who has been ungracious? as usual you plastic scouse cunt you come out with all the &amp;quot;scum&amp;quot; shite and old cliched crap.  United were outplayed simple as, it was the worst and most lathargic I&amp;#039;ve seen us play in ages and like I stated yesterday the gobshite Liverpool fans are out in force acting like they&amp;#039;ve won the world cup. Check back on previous encounters and you&amp;#039;ll see the reaction when United win (as they usually do) is far more gracious.    i&amp;#039;m sorry to hurt your feelings..*hug hug*....oh geezuz... most of us liverpool fans ARE gracious... go check back at the thread chelsea vs liverpool champs league semis...i remember most of us saying how great agame it was and how chelsea deserved it. and the past 5 years!! every time after u scum beat us, always saying how you are too much for us. better managing,better passion.   and ive always used scum united, just like i&amp;#039;ve always read liverpile. didn&amp;#039;t know some of you english were so sensitive, like ronaldos reaction after getting tackled. j/k
