 Why are Spurs so reluctant to registering Rocha, Stalteri, Ghaly, Boateng and Taarabt? I mean, Ghaly could be useful as a holding midfielder, even if the club don&amp;#039;t consider him up to their standards. At least he&amp;#039;s got plenty of EPL experience. And I&amp;#039;d rather play Stalteri in a natural position than Zokora in an un-natural one.
