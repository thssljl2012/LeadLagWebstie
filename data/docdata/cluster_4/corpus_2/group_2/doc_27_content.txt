    SteveManics:  Funny how the United supporters are being gracious in defeat and admitting Liverpool deserved to win, yet &amp;#039;fans&amp;#039; like Neil, Pablo and Mateo feel the need to talk crap and slag us off.  Ah well, every side has its share of arsehole fans  you may be gracious...but not all of you. and us usual liverpool lot of fans are always, USUALLY, gracious in defeat...ie, chelsea in champs leage this year, man u beating us constantly.
