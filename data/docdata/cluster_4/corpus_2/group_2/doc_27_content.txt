His shooting is laughably bad and the only time he ever looks assured shooting for goal is with his head.      What about Mikel though?      I don&amp;#039;t think I&amp;#039;ve ever seen one guy outshine every other central midfielder on the pitch by that much before. He could&amp;#039;ve beaten that Fletcher-Hargreaves combination by himself.      Give the guy a challenge.
