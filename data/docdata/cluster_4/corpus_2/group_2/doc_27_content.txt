Frank McGarahan, 45, the CEO of Barclays Wealth, in charge of assets worth 133 billion in 21 countries, was out with his brother and another male ahead of a family christening later that day in Norwich.       As they queued for a taxi at the Guildhall Hill rank at 3am Mr McGarahan spotted a man being attacked by a group of youths and is believed to have shouted at the gang to stop. Police say he did not physically intervene.       They then turned on him, inflicting serious head injuries. His brother was also injured as he tried to help as was a nearby doorman who suffered a fractured jaw.       Mr McGarahan, the father of two young children, was taken to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital before being transferred to Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge where he died.       Officers are trying to locate a gang seen running from the area immediately after the attack.       Mr McGarahan joined Barclays Capital in 1998, having previously worked at Deutsche Bank.    --------   A comment left by a Times Online reader:      Until we bring back capital punishment, thugs will just continue to get away with lawlessness and murder. And we are complaining that our prisons are full up and so expensive for the law-abiding tax payers. They wouldn&amp;#039;t be if murdereres were hung.
