  I fear Wigan at the JJB. I think we&amp;#039;ll lose this game to add more misery to me and my fellow Boro fans.  We need to get rid of O&amp;#039;Neill completely from our squad. The lad has done nothing but lose the ball too much. Riggott should be benched since he has no balance whatsoever and keeps falling on the ground all the time, and quite frankly, it&amp;#039;s embarrassing.         Turnbull                  Hoyte Huth Wheater Taylor                  Johnson Shawky Arca Downing                       Alves Aliadiere   Subs: Jones, Riggott, Digard, Emnes, Mido, Walker, Craddock.  The defense is still quite shite if Huth and Wheater continue on their current form and Taylor just isn&amp;#039;t good enough.  The midfield is quite good. Yes, we&amp;#039;ll lose the spark of the right wing with Aliadiere up-front but Johnson can play quite well. Shawky is pacey and versible and Arca wins balls. Why hasn&amp;#039;t Southgate started him is beyond me.  Up-front? Quite simple. Alves is dangerous up-front and luck just wasn&amp;#039;t on his side. Mido&amp;#039;s a wanker that should never start ever again in attack. Even though him and Alves can link up quite well....for the first 20 minutes of the match.  We should bring in Digard and Mido in the 2nd half and put Riggott in depending on the score and the time remaining.
