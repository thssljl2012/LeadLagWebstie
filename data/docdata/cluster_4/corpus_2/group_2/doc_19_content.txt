     I checked on the Barclays Premier League official website, but they do not have tickets available for any of the December games yet. BUT there is a website called Sold Out Entertainment, and they have tickets available in December. Its URL is:  http://www.soldoutentertainments.com/liv....008-p-2140.html  And from what I saw, the tickets started at 110 Euros. You could also try ticketmaster.com too, thats what I use here in the U.S.
