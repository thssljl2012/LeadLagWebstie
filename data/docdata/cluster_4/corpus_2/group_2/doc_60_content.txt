 And btw folks - while we&amp;#039;re running down Keane, Anelka, Alan Smith and others....      Hi Wayne Rooney! Playing at Manchester United an attacking team providing lots of opportunities and your goal scoring record is abysmal. And you have had one month like Keane or even nine months like Anelka you&amp;#039;ve had more than enough time buddy.
