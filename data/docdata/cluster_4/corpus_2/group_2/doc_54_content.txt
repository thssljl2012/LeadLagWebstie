   quote  Joe Cole pretty much confirming today that he can&amp;#039;t finish for beans. A draw was probably a fair result , but Utd will be kicking themselves for having lost the lead.   Fact  And that&amp;#039;s the annoying part, Ferguson should have brought in Tevez instead of O&amp;#039;Shea. But really half of the Chelsea are cheats.  Edit: Man City scored the third goal by Robinho.
