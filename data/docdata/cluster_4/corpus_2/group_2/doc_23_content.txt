   quote   DjedwardSmith     I&amp;#039;m not going to say nancy boy dived. But if you watch the replays of it, it does look like he actually forced himself to fall over. If you watch his foot that&amp;#039;s placed on the floor, and then follow his body it looks as if he forces himself down, if that makes any sense at all.   So what you are saying is that Ronaldo has perfected a way of diving and is now able to win penalties almost at will. It wouldn&amp;#039;t surprise me if he did tbh.
