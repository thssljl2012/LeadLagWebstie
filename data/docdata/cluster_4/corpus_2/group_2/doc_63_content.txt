   quote   Raffaele 17      Funny how one person can say he is shite, and another say he is top class.  Personally I don&amp;#039;t think he can be judged by anyone yet, apart from someone who has frequently watched Dutch football in the last few seasons.  He has shown signs that he could be a good &amp;#039;keeper, but he has also looked a little uncomfortable at times.   I just hop on the bandwagon. I don&amp;#039;t really believe what I write. I see something on MOTD and then form an opinion as if its fact. Lesson don&amp;#039;t listen to what I say, unless of course its about how talented every single Irish player is
