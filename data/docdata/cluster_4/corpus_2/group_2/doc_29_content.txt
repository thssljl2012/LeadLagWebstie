 In your opinion though, whats your best starting line-up? I think most Liverpool fans would go with a 4-5-1 with Torres as a lone striker, something like this   Alonso Mascherano Gerrard Kuyt  - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  -  Riera Torres    Don&amp;#039;t see why Rafa has so much faith in Kuyt, hes a hard-worker and has the odd good game but when you&amp;#039;ve got 30 odd million to spend and your looking at your squad, you&amp;#039;d pick Kuyt as the weakest in that line-up.
