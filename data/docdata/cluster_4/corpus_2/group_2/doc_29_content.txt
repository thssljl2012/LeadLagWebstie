We dont understand some signings he makes or some steps he takes.. but &amp;amp;quot;In Arsene we trust&amp;amp;quot; and we always will.. as long as he is at Emirates we will be top4.. Liverpool can go down.. just you wait and see till UCL starts and Rafa starts making 11 changes a game to the starting lineup      Arsenal have had a young squad for the last five years now. You cannot use having a &amp;amp;quot;young squad&amp;amp;quot; as an excuse, I mean he handpicked every single player in the Arsenal squad, so it was his choice. I bet if Arsenal signed 20 League 1 players when the media would still lick his balls and exclaim &amp;amp;quot;but they are League 1 players, leave poor Arsene alone&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;quot;.
