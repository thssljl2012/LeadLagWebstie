 Decent performance today, Carew and Reo-Coker were both excellent, whilst Stiliyan Petrov has amazingly and suddenly turned into actually a very good player. Barry wasn&amp;#039;t at the races though, rather disappointing.   Still, 4th in the league, 2 points behind Arsenal, 3 wins out of 3 tricky away games in 6 days and almost in the group stage of the UEFA Cup, I&amp;#039;m not complaining. Good time to be a Villa fan at the moment.
