   quote   cambiasso       quote   Jmste       quote   cambiasso     Gomes is a clown. He has the size, and all the attributes a goalkeeper could need yet he is shite. No keeper should make that much mistakes in so little time.  If only Given had his physique.    Are you blind? Or do you just go off the 2 minutes of Match of the day?  He has been fantastic for us, kept us in the game at Chelsea and basically won the game at Newcastle. He commands the box unlike some keepers, he has made 1 mistake, I wouldn&amp;#039;t call that a big mistake today tbf.    Well if you read...    quote  Me just like a few posts ago     just hop on the bandwagon. I don&amp;#039;t really believe what I write. I see something on MOTD and then form an opinion as if its fact. Lesson don&amp;#039;t listen to what I say, unless of course its about how talented every single Irish player is      Didn&amp;#039;t look on this page, sorry.
