   quote   Star_of_spurs     Levy shouldn&amp;#039;t sack Ramos, it should be Commolli. He&amp;#039;s signed all these players (Kaboul, Bent, I think Bentley also) and they&amp;#039;ve done nothing so far.   Sack Commolli. We don&amp;#039;t need a Director of Footballer. Let Ramos do his job.     I agree.  I don&amp;#039;t understand why we need him, all he does is go and scout France and picks up these players who are shite. Get rid.
