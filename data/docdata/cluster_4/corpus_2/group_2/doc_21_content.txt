 Rafael Benitez has today confirmed that Fabio Aurelio will miss Saturday&amp;#039;s clash at home to Stoke City through injury.  The Brazilian full-back was ruled out of Tuesday night&amp;#039;s Champions League victory in Marseille with a calf strain he sustained against Manchester United and is still not fit to face the Barclays Premier League newcomers tomorrow.       &amp;amp;quot;Only Fabio Aurelio is out injured,&amp;amp;quot; said Benitez. &amp;amp;quot;The rest of the squad is okay.&amp;amp;quot;
