            Quote from: Bob Loblaw on  Yesterday  at 04:09:00 PM   All depends really. And TBH, if losing to Chelsea meant we won all the others i&amp;amp;#039;d certainly take it.    We should win the others anyways. This is the sort of run of games where we can make ourselves serious title contenders. Though I&amp;amp;#039;d be delighted with 12 myself. &amp;amp;#039;Cos following this, we have a nice stretch 6-7 easy games until the Arsenal game. I know I&amp;amp;#039;m looking forward too early, but think we need to plan our title challenge looking at these sorts of runs.
