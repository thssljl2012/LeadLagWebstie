            Quote from: offthemark on  Today  at 01:38:59 AM   yes we&amp;amp;#039;ll win at stamford bridge this time. We beat Man u after years and now it is chelsea. During the run for 19th in the 19th year (running year) , we will break a lot of records. Thats my prophecy.   The name &amp;amp;#039;offthemark&amp;amp;#039; doesn&amp;amp;#039;t make you seem very credible.&amp;amp;nbsp;
