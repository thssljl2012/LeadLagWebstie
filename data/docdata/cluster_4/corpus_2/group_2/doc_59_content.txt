 Wolves and the noses will run away with it. 8 points clear of 3rd place - at this stage - is absolutely ridiculous, victory at Reading midweek would push them even clearer and you would expect two decent results against Swansea and Coventry. Just got to make sure they don&amp;#039;t do a Watford and burn themselves out around Christmas time.   In the Premiership, I fully expect West Brom to steer clear of relegation. Strong, creative midfield, although I can&amp;#039;t really see where the goals are going to be flowing from. Is Luke Moore still a lazy bastard ? You got robbed of 3m there. Imagine 3 of Wigan, Fulham, Stoke, Hull and Bolton to go down. My bets are on the latter three. First time in years that there is no obvious single candidate to be thumped every week and finish on a pitiful amount of points. Can&amp;#039;t see us breaking the top 4, if Agbonlahor and Carew get injured, then our strikeforce is 17 year old Nathan Delfouneso and misfiring spastic Marlon Harewood. Actually, saying that, take away Ashley Young and we immediately lose a massive chunk of creativity.  Anyway, 2-1 to Portsmouth today. Though thats more out of hope than anything.
