   I love the confidence of all Man Utd fans.  I can&amp;#039;t see you winning but who knows.  You&amp;#039;ve tried in the last 6 years, and failed.   I can see Chelsea winning it. We had a better result in mid-week which makes us more foucsed on Sunday&amp;#039;s game.  You haven&amp;#039;t got Vidic which I believe is a huge loss. Will be an interesting game, but I can see Deco or Drogba scoring.
