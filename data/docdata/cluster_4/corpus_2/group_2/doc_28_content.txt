   quote   Venne     Not looking foward to stoke tbh  . They kept Liverpool out but i think we have a better chance of breaking there defence. I heard somewhere that they have the biggest defence in the prem? Which would certainly make Drogba less affective.     Drogba&amp;#039;s got a lot of strengh though. They could be big, but weak.   Use Anelka because his pace would help a lot.  I think we can get a good win against Stoke. Hopefully Deco will be back by then
