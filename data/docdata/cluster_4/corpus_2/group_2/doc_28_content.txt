   quote   Subaru7       quote   Dan_bug     20 years service to the club and they initially didnt let him leave?   What was that about?   With 20 years of service, who&amp;#039;d want him to leave?  Fergie&amp;#039;s been at Man U for who knows how long, but I don&amp;#039;t see anyone wanting him to leave.   I doubt Chelsea wanted him to leave, but if he wants to leave after 20 years of service to the club, he should be allowed to without question.
