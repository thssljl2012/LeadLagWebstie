   quote   The Hudd        So for example, from 5pm to 9pm, we can join the game on Network and do our changes to the team. Is this the only time it is played? Or do you the holiday it and then we pick it up every evening at 5pm?  I&amp;#039;d like to join but I&amp;#039;ve had trouble getting Network games going and haven&amp;#039;t been able to figure out a way around it so far.      yeah u got it right the first time, from when ever i load the databse then it would be then left on up to 4 hrs, holiday etc is totally up to you i guess, how active u wanna be is ur choice.
