   quote   Audacity       quote   Will     You have to hate hangovers. My mum has one, so she&amp;#039;s lying in bed all day in the room with Sky. Then, downstairs, my dad is watching something, so I&amp;#039;ll have to listen to the Manc vs. Chelsea game on the radio.    What&amp;#039;s he watching instead of the football?    I haven&amp;#039;t been down to check, but it would be something like Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. He only watches football if he can go to a bar and drink, but he&amp;#039;s hungover from last night, so he&amp;#039;s just chilling.
