   quote   D I O S       quote   Mycon     Yeah, the Ronaldo penalty was not a dive, if anyone says it is a dive you are only saying that because it is Ronaldo.   It&amp;#039;s not a dive but once he&amp;#039;s going over he makes the most of it, look at the combined arm and leg flick having been touched!  The thing is though, Styles cheated! He is a top 2 arse-licker, and if possible will give them every possible decision there is. Whether this is because he is scared of Ferguson or that he is just a *bleep* is irrelevant, he cheated and that&amp;#039;s whats pissing off most people.  Also if Ronaldo was feeling truly graceful he&amp;#039;d have passed it into Jussi&amp;#039;s arms I don&amp;#039;t care if he didn&amp;#039;t celebrate, he majorly profited from an incorrect decision that he KNEW was incorrect therefore bring the game into disrepute!   Ronaldo is a wanker, he&amp;#039;d never do that last thing.   The thing that annoys me most is that we would have won the game anyway if the penalty hadn&amp;#039;t been given and there would have been no fuss. I don&amp;#039;t think Styles cheated, I just think he is a rtard and he was influenced by the home fans which shows how poor of a referee he is because that should never happen.
