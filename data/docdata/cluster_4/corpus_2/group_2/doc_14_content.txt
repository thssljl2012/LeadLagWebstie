 Footballing career is a relatively short career. Its only like 15-20 years these days...then what after that? Most of the best players are dumb as hell. They aren&amp;#039;t gonna go out and land Ph.Ds and Degrees.  So in a way, they kinda have to earn a bit of money in their short career, otherwise they&amp;#039;d be *bleep*ed later on in life.
