Interestingly the bookies, or  SkyBet  at least, fancy Villa&amp;#039;s chances of finishing in the top 4 more than Liverpool&amp;#039;s chances of winning the league.     Barclays Premiership 2008/09 - Win Outright    Liverpool 13/2      Barclays Premiership To Finish In Top 4 2008/09 - Win Outright    Aston Villa 9/2     Both worth a fiver imo
