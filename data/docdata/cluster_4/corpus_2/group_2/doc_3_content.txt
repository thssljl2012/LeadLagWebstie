   quote   Subaru7     Now give me another example where he puts in a good final pass.  His pass to Kuyt led to the second too.   Now, correct me if I&amp;#039;m wrong, but with one assist and being involved in the set-up of the second, in a 2-0 scoreline, seems like a good shift to me? If I were to call him on a flaw in his Liverpool career so far it would be he&amp;#039;s trying too hard and isn&amp;#039;t scoring goals. That&amp;#039;ll come in time - but to say he doesn&amp;#039;t utilisize his teammates when both the goals have came from him is very wide off the mark I think.
