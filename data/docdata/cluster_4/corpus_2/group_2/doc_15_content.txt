          Mascherano will be key for us if we are to win at Stamford Bridge. I just feel this year we are starting to click and the players carry a lot more belief that previous years. A draw isn&amp;amp;#039;t a bad result though, if you&amp;amp;#039;re being realistic. I think the games against Wigan &amp;amp;amp; Citeh will be just as tough in my opinion, just because these are the games we often drop points in.  I think Keane &amp;amp;amp; Torres are just about to hit form as well. I can feel it.   Somebody&amp;amp;#039;s defence is going to get raped any day now...
