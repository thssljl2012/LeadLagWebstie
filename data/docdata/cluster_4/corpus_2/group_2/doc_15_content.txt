           Greetings ....      This post (my apologies for its length) will show actual and alternative 2008 Fed Ex Cup scenarios.           The Actual Facts        Vijay Singh has all but clinched the Fed Ex Cup. All he has to do is officially complete all 72 holes of the Tour Championship at Atlanta&amp;#039;s East Lake GC on September 25-28.      If Singh should withdraw or be disqualified from the Tour Championship, then either Camilo Villegas or Sergio Garcia, with a win at East Lake, could claim the Fed Ex Cup. No one else has a shot at the Cup.      Top 30 Fed Ex Cup points leaders going into the Tour Championship .....

Singh won the Barclays in sudden-death over Sergio Garcia and Kevin Sutherland. For this, Singh earned 11,000 points, while Garcia and Sutherland each earned 6,400 points, a difference of 4,600 points between the winner and two runner-ups.      Assuming that either Sutherland or Garcia had won the Barclays, and that all other results before the Tour Championship were &amp;amp;quot;as is&amp;amp;quot;, then the Cup could have been claimed by any of these --      Singh, Villegas, Garcia, Furyk, Weir, Kim, Leonard and (if he had won Barclays) Sutherland.      Assuming a Sutherland or Garcia win at Barclays, a Singh WD or DQ at the Tour Championship, and all results prior to the Tour Championship &amp;amp;quot;as is&amp;amp;quot;, then each player (other than Singh) on the current actual Fed Ex Cup list down to #13 Kenny Perry would have had a chance at the Fed Ex Cup.              ALTERNATIVE OUTCOME SCENARIOS: Part Two        First, we assume a different Fed Ex Cup points distribution for the Tour Championship, as follows ....      Code:       1 .. 18,000     6 .. 3,600    11 .. 2,700    16 .. 2,120    21 .. 1,880    26 .. 1,680    2 .. 10,800     7 .. 3,400    12 .. 2,560    17 .. 2,040    22 .. 1,840    27 .. 1,660    3 ..  6,900     8 .. 3,200    13 .. 2,440    18 .. 2,000    23 .. 1,800    28 .. 1,640    4 ..  4,800     9 .. 3,000    14 .. 2,320    19 .. 1,960    24 .. 1,760    29 .. 1,620    5 ..  4,000    10 .. 2,840    15 .. 2,200    20 .. 1,920    25 .. 1,720    30 .. 1,600    Next, we assume that all 2008 play-off event results to date are &amp;amp;quot;as is&amp;amp;quot;. This assumption would make the first nine players on the actual current Fed Ex Cup list eligible for the Cup, using the alternative Tour Championship points scale.         Now, if we assume that either Kevin Sutherland or Segio Garcia had won the Barclays, and that if all other results up to the Tour Championship were &amp;amp;quot;as is&amp;amp;quot;, then - again using the alternative Tour Championship points scale - then every player in the field down to #30 Chad Campbell would have been eligible for the Fed Ex Cup. And that, folks, is WITHOUT a Singh WD or DQ!      Thanx-A-Lot, Frank-0-Sport
