   quote   CONNORBWFC       Now City have Robinho i think they will finish 5th      One player doesn&amp;#039;t instantly make them better. I predict that unless they work well together they won&amp;#039;t get much further than 8th. If they can produce some moments of brilliance and pull of some big scalps against the likes of Man United, Chelsea and Liverpool, then i reckon maybe they could push for a top 7.
