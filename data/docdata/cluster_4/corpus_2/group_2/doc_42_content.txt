 Thought we should&amp;#039;ve won yesterday to be honest, but we didn&amp;#039;t really have any outstanding performers apart from maybe Ashley Cole. Great battle between him and Hargreaves until Hargreaves was moved to the centre.  Ronaldo is a diving prick, can&amp;#039;t believe nobody&amp;#039;s commented about it on here. Cheating scumbag. But he&amp;#039;s a United hero, of course.  I was impressed with Drogba, thought we didn&amp;#039;t get the ball up to him enough. He&amp;#039;s still a dickhead though. Dunno what&amp;#039;s happened to Anelka to be honest, I thought his general play was pretty good, took the piss outta Gary Neville but missing from that kinda range was just incredible. I think he&amp;#039;s got the ability to be a world-beater as well. Would like to see him and Drog up front in a 4-4-2 but I don&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;s Scolari&amp;#039;s style.  Thought Mikel gave the ball away an awful lot but defensively he was sound. Bosingwa and Cech should&amp;#039;ve done a lot better for the United goal. Berbatov was anonymous, Mikel had him in his pocket most of the game tbh.
