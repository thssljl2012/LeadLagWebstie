   quote  D I O S    Also, actually interested here, do people think that Styles cheated, or it was just a stupid decision?     Well he should have atleats the decency to admit he made a mistake instead of keeping quiet when it was never a penalty. Hopefully next time he&amp;#039;ll think twice before blowing his whistle for a penalty.   Also people say Man city are gonna buy their way to the top and shit but look at spurs , they&amp;#039;ve spent all that money and look how shit their start has being. I think it all goes down to which manager you give money to , some managers handle money well others dont. Ramos has compelety wasted the boards money on players who werent really needed.
