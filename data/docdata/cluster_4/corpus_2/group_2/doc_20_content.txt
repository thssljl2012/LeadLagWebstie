          Its a tough run of games that will make it alot clearer if we are genuine challengers or not. I am quite positve though, we look excellent at the back and theres no doubting the quality that we have up front, they are just going through a bit of a barren spell.  Everton: win City: win Wigan: win Chelsea: loss Pompey: win Come on the reds!
