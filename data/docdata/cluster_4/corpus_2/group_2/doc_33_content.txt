   quote   D I O S       quote   Venne      i don&amp;#039;t see how going to West Ham is furthering his career.    That&amp;#039;s not why he left! He left cause he was basically sacked! There&amp;#039;s no furthering his career here, it&amp;#039;s just Roman furthering his control over the club.   Didn&amp;#039;t Chelsea intitially reject his reisignation.
