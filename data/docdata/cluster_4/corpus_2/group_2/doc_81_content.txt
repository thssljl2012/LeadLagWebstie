They are also spoiling football. Each club has one or two &amp;#039;super&amp;#039; players..Torres/Gerrard..Adebayor/Fabregas...and these people are trying to buy them all so once a club gets a new hero these idiots come along and snatch them and kill the morale of everything.  It&amp;#039;s like...I wouldn&amp;#039;t go to see a team if I knew all the &amp;#039;under developed&amp;#039; players are on..I want all want to see the big names&amp;amp;#33;
