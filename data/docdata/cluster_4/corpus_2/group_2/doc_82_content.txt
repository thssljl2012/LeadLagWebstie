            Quote from: STORMTROOPER on  Yesterday  at 05:27:48 PM    just a realist.&amp;amp;nbsp; the people who reckon we&amp;amp;#039;ll get 15pts from those games are talkin out of there ass.  You are right, but we have to approach these games looking for a win and see what we get. Realistically they are 3 tough away games and 2 home games against physical sides so 11 points would be an excellent return.
