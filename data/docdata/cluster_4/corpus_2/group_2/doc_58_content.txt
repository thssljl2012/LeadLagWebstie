I like the look of Ilunga. Very good defensively and can get forward a bit more then I expected. Our CMS have dominated whereas Newcastles have gone unsighted. Who is partnering Butt in the middle. Think its sposed to be Charles but hes drifting to the left too much      Good start, but in reality Newcastle have just been awful                      We might as well forfeit our games for the near future, no bother wasting anyones time, the effort just isn&amp;#039;t there.      By the way, Cacapa is in central midfield, clearly should be N&amp;#039;Zogbia partnering him but hey, what can you do.      It&amp;#039;ll finish 3 or 4 nil, I&amp;#039;ve gotta get up at 7.30 in the morning so I should be going to bed, but I&amp;#039;m not. I&amp;#039;ll regret it tomorrow.
