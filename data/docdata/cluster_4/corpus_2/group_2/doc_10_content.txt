Don&amp;#039;t let this man cross the ball. Him and Big Jules could have target practice into the crowd. First to hit the old lady in row 69 wins.                      Seriously.. Big Jules is a great crosser of the ball. FC saw that first hand today. Hes the best crosser we have had in our side in yonks. Great technique.      Dossena doesnt cross the ball though from what I seen. He takes shots at goal but instead puts them into the penalty box, well thats the aim. No technique at all.       It cost you 2 points not 3 and if we were counting you would still be +100 points over the past 5 years for referee assisted points.
