   ^^  Doesn&amp;#039;t really piss me off.  It&amp;#039;s not like Anelka&amp;#039;s our most important striker.  We&amp;#039;ve got Drogba and considering we play a 4-3-3 or 4-5-1 most the time, it&amp;#039;s going to be Drogba who gets picked.  Only 2 weeks for Deco. Not bad. I though Riccy would be out longer because I heard it was something to do with ligaments.  Oh well, Alex or Ivanovic should be able to cover. Hey, we might finally see Ivanovic play
