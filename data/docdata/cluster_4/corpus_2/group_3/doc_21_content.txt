 The official site :   Quote:   TONY Mowbray has revealed   Filipe Teixeira   will miss out on making his long-awaited Barclays Premier League bow at Manchester United on Saturday (ko 5.30pm). The Portuguese ace was set to step up his comeback from a six-month knee injury lay-off by getting 90 minutes under his belt in a reserves friendly against Leicester City on Tuesday. But, after suffering a minor calf strain in training the previous day, he was pulled out of the Foxes clash. And although the midfield ace is eager to play, Mowbray has urged caution and insists there is no need to rush him back.  &amp;amp;quot;Filipe is not going to play at Old Trafford,&amp;amp;quot; said the Baggies boss. &amp;amp;quot;He felt tightness in his calf on Monday. It&amp;#039;s not an injury that concerns us. It&amp;#039;s a boy who is too desperate to play and he probably cramped up in his calf. He wasn&amp;#039;t ready to play on Tuesday. As I&amp;#039;ve always said, I want him to play 90 minutes somewhere down the line before I play him in the first team again. There is no need to throw him back into the team. He&amp;#039;ll probably be back training on Monday and I&amp;#039;ll probably have to tell him again he has to play some football before he gets back into the side.&amp;amp;quot;    Chris Brunt   has missed the last two games with a hamstring injury but could come into contention against United after coming through a 61-minute run-out on Tuesday. &amp;amp;quot;I played Chris at left-back so he didn&amp;#039;t have to be as combative and could just stand and deliver the ball, which he can do with his eyes shut,&amp;amp;quot; Mowbray added. &amp;amp;quot;It wasn&amp;#039;t a physically demanding day for Chris. It was about easing him up from light training. He&amp;#039;s going to travel with us and we&amp;#039;ll wait and see if he&amp;#039;s got any part to play.&amp;amp;quot;    Do-heon Kim   is ahead of schedule in his recovery from the medial ligament knee damage he suffered at Middlesbrough almost three weeks ago. And the Korea Republic star has this week been reunited with his family after flying out to his homeland to bring them over to England permanently. &amp;amp;quot;Kim is progressing well and the physio says he is probably ahead of schedule,&amp;amp;quot; said Mowbray. &amp;amp;quot;Let&amp;#039;s hope we don&amp;#039;t need him urgently, that Filipe gets back on the fringes next week, everyone else stays fit and we have more options so Kim can filter back into the squad when he&amp;#039;s fit and ready.&amp;amp;quot;
