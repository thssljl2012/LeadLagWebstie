 I&amp;#039;m sure Rooney would be celebrating a little bit harder last night after having his first ruled out very harshly.  Pleased with a 0-0 draw aginast Villa. Harry got the tactics right by not starting Belhadj (but when he came on it looked like he&amp;#039;d been shot out a cannon  ). Pamarot gives us more defensive steel. Not pleased Davis was sent of so harshly. We&amp;#039;re already very, very short in center midfield. Looks like Mvumeba and Diop next match unless Diarra or Hughes get themselves fit.
