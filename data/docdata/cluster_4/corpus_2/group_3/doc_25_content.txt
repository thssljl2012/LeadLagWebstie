            Quote from: 43 and counting! on  Today  at 12:10:28 AM   this Felix guy isn&amp;amp;#039;t Welsh is he, by any chance?   http://lowlander.wordpress.com/2005/02/09/welsh-rugby-fan-cuts-off-testicles-after-win/     Quote    Geoff Huish, 26, was so convinced England would win Saturdays match he told fellow drinkers at a social club, If Wales win Ill cut my balls off, the paper said on Tuesday. Friends at the club in Caerphilly, south Wales, thought he was joking.  Waless subsequent 11-9 victory over England at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was their first home win over England in 12 years.  So after the game Huish went home, severed his testicles with a knife, and walked 200 metres back to the bar with the testicles to show the shocked drinkers what he had done.    Now there&amp;amp;#039;s a man of his word.
