Spanish media are reporting it was precautionary as the Liverpool striker had felt a tweak in the muscle in the back of his left leg.  Liverpool will be hoping it is not serious problem as they face Wigan and Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League next week, as well as a Champions League trip to Torres&amp;#039; former club Atletico Madrid.  Torres started the match well enough, firing in a 35-yard shot inside the opening two minutes that Belgium goalkeeper Stijn Stijnen needed to push away, but he was replaced not long after with the European Champions trailing 1-0 in Brussels.       And Babel only lasted 27 minutes for Holland           lol?
