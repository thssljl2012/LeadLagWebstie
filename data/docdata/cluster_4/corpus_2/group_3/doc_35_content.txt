   Eduardo is &amp;#039;three weeks away&amp;#039; from return    By Richard Clarke Thursday, October 23, 2008   www.arsenal.com   Eduardo will be back playing competitive football in three weeks. The Arsenal striker suffered horrific leg and ankle injuries at Birmingham back on February 23 and, in the immediate aftermath, it was feared his career could be in doubt. However the Croatian was operated on that evening in the Midlands and has been working hard on his rehabilitation ever since. Speaking at Arsenals AGM on Thursday morning, Arsne Wenger confirmed that the long wait is nearly over. Eduardo is three weeks away from playing competitive football, he said. However, it appears Tomas Rosickys return will take a little longer. He should be back after Christmas, said Wenger. The Czech midfielder has been out since January 29 with a hamstring problem.   Excellent news for us, but I think he&amp;#039;ll be playing in the reserves for a little while and it will take him a while to find his feet in the team again and start scoring goals. Unfortunately Rosicknote doesn&amp;#039;t look so good, taking almost a year to recover from an injury which was originally only supposed to keep him out for 2-3 weeks.
