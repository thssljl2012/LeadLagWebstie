   Is he referee-ing our game DIOS :S    quote  An unnamed party have made a fresh bid to buy West Ham United FC, according to reports.  The club&amp;#039;s current owner, Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson is said to have received a bid to purchase the club within the last few days, according to a snippet in today&amp;#039;s Guardian.  Gudmundsson is understood to have rejected the bid instantly, whilst insisting that the club he purchased nearly two years ago for 85million was not for sale.  The identity of the bidders remains unknown but a number of syndicates, some of which are based in the Middle East have been sniffing around a number of Premier League clubs of late.    Fair play to saying no... I quite like the Icelandic bunch more than a middle eastern group. They seem to have a long term plan in mind. Although the 30m to Sheffield united will be pocket change.
