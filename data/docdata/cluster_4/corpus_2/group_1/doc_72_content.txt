  Lloyds TSB are the only bank that do this.     I have an under 19&amp;#039;s account and a saving account that I do this with. It&amp;#039;s ok, though don&amp;#039;t expect to save much. Mine&amp;#039;s around 100/200 a year, though it&amp;#039;s  not bad as you don&amp;#039;t really miss the money as it comes out in small amounts.
