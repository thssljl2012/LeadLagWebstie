  You don&amp;#039;t seem to know your English history.      Of course the Blitz posed a threat to England, and the other British nations as well, but I am talking of specifically to England alone, also the Norman 1066 invasion was a successfull invasion and then the Normans ruled over England, the Blitz wasn&amp;#039;t successfull, i.e. this is our biggest threat since 1066.       Read my post carefully and properly before wading in about St Georges day, as I said we have no &amp;#039;official&amp;#039; Saints day to celebrate, i.e. there is no official bank holiday and no official recognition of St George&amp;#039;s Day from the authorities in England, and they put zero amount into suporting it whilst putting thousands into non English celebrations here. you also won&amp;#039;t undersatand this as you don&amp;#039;t even seem to be English it seems?      England did exist before 1066, the begining of England as a nation and land began in the late 6th century.   And as for the Normans invented England nonsense!!???? they invaded lead by the sick William the basted, they attacked an already battled scard Anglo-Saxon army who had just beat off a Viking invasion at Stamford Bridge, the Normans managed to beat a very brave Anglo-Saxon army, and yes then England became a colony of the Normandy, but English resistance remained,  England didn&amp;#039;t become Norman did it, the true English still existed despite an attempt at cultural cleansing by the Normans, and it was around a few thousand Normans that actualy stayed in England and eventualy spread themselves thinly over England, assimulating into an English society becoming anglicised! not the other way around! hence the English still exist in England!!!   So who actualy won 1066 really?      None of this was copy and pasted, and even if it was, am I not allowed to do this? what if I totaly agree with what is written by some one else and want to use it as it makes a point that I totaly agree with etc ?      Yourself no doubt learn from reading books yeah? well that is simply copying and pasting into your mind and then you repeat it to others don&amp;#039;t you?      Your point is not much to go on either as you have left England and do not live here or feel what is going on any more, and I doubt that you are actualy an Englishman at all, you seem to be scotish yes? and anti English by the sound of it?

That whole German Army thing over the Channel posed no threat whatsoever to England, I guess?      Two points. One, England has a Saint&amp;#039;s Day. It&amp;#039;s St. George&amp;#039;s Day. Either you knew that, or you are just copy/pasting some other idiot&amp;#039;s Daily Mail fueled screed.      Two, there was no such thing as England before 1066, it&amp;#039;s impossible for a country to be threatened when it doesn&amp;#039;t exist. Like it or not, the Normans invented England.      Not that it matters. I doubt you&amp;#039;ll be back to answer these points anyway, unless you have some other site you can copy/paste from.
