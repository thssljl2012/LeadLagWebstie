         We opened a commonwealth bank account, just a normal savings one in Made&amp;#039;s name, we only put the money for our electricity and phone and sometimes send money for Galungan.  If our nephew goes to the commonwealth bank atm its $1.50, which he never does! He goes to the nearest ATM in our village which is Lippo and we are charged $6.50
