           Quote:           Steve Jetley discovered the alteration when he next tried to access his account, but was subsequently told it was &amp;amp;quot;inappropriate&amp;amp;quot; to change the password back to &amp;amp;quot;Lloyds is pants&amp;amp;quot;, or to his second choice, &amp;amp;quot;Barclays is better&amp;amp;quot;.         Well he could change his name to &amp;amp;quot;Lloyds is pants&amp;amp;quot; by deed poll. _________________ I am still writing my autobiography at the moment and I expect it to be finished in late 2016.
