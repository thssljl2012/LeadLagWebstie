 AIG is in a world of hurt. Today it was reported they took a 2nd quarter net loss of 5.36 BILLION dollars. Maybe they&amp;#039;ll rethink your cancellation tomorrow.  The could probably use the spare change!        I was with them for almost a year only &amp;#039;cuz they bought out GE Capital I think it was. That&amp;#039;s who I was insured with at the time of the buy out and when me renewal came around, they raised me a whole bunch for no reason, never had an accident claim, no tickets, and I had 4 vehicles on their dole. I told them to Pack Fudge!      Screw &amp;#039;em and feed &amp;#039;em tunafish! I say! All the insurers.        If you stick with any of them, you&amp;#039;re gonna get it in the shorts sooner or later. I have no loyalty to any one insurer &amp;#039;cuz regardless what they say to get your business, not one has a loyalty to a small customer like us.      I shop my auto insurance policies every single year and if I find one that&amp;#039;s a bit cheaper for the same coverage, I&amp;#039;m gone......I&amp;#039;m a dot....I&amp;#039;m outta there.
