  Not that anyone noticed, but I weren&amp;#039;t around much last week as my mother was over for a visit, first time I&amp;#039;ve seen her in almost 5 years, so that was nice.      Lucky sod got BA business class tickets because my sister has done 10 years for BA so got a bump in tickets from the crap normal standby rubbish.      Her travel insurance was good too, 25 squid for the week, something to do with a Barclays account...she&amp;#039;s 70 btw.      Oh, and just finished doing an art test for some place, hope that works out...had to do it at a mates place though as my desktop got sent back to Acer for dodgy hardware failure.      So what have I missed?
