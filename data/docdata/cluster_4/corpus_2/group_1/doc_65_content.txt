                       &amp;amp;nbsp;             Money seems to have created a split in my holding in Barclays making 102       shares for every 100 I held.  I am convinced that I did not enter this       split.  I have downloaded the SP regularly and noticed the split a few days       ago.            Is this a bug?  I have undone the problem.
