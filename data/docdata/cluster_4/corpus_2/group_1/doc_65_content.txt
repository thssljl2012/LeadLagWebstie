                                      Hi,      But what&amp;#039;s the point?      As for the Rabbit reference, how history repeats itself - How could Barclays/hutchinson/BAE do something in the early-90&amp;#039;s/late-80&amp;#039;s that people/telco&amp;#039;s are getting excited about now?    Also, I remember Eckoh (earlier in its life) in the late-90&amp;#039;s doing this with just such an MVNO/Bundled model for the business market.      Kind regards,      MN
