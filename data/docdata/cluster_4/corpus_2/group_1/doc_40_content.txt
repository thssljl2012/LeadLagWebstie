           So, I get this funky letter in the mail the other day from Barclays Bank talking about they&amp;#039;ve closed my card due to too many accounts opened and the recent increase in the number of bankcard inquiries. WTH?      Nothing has changed since they approved me for this card. Are they just now looking at my credit reports. I&amp;#039;m done with this second class banking institution. I&amp;#039;m not only sending them their card cut up with all the original paperwork, but I&amp;#039;m sending them a FOAD (now that I know what that means) letter. I dont need that bullcrap. I&amp;#039;m creditworthy and none of my balances are high. They&amp;#039;re probably ticked because I haven&amp;#039;t used the card yet. Sigh. Whatever&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;
