 When they called me back with a quote yesterday I asked them the question about being regulated, as Orangetiggs recommended, and the guy said I was the second person to ask that day.  He told me it should be fine as their accounts are all held with Barclays Bank?!  Not sure if that would mean we were covered or not, so are looking into other options too.
