 Hey Mark,     I&amp;#039;m now living and working in Michigan, glad to hear you got another Viper....what did you choose?

This guy doesnt look like any newbie either- looks like hes had his fair share of Vipers which mentions to say he SOLD them.            Anways...Sorry man- been there myself, learned from it and bought another...
