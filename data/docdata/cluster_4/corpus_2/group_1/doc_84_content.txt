             QUOTE (theshoediva &amp;amp;#064; Aug 4 2008, 06&amp;amp;#58;13 AM)       At any rate, I have NO intention of EVER applying for another Barclay product again. They&amp;#039;ve lost a customer for life behind this foolishness.     Screw Juniper/Barclays and be happy that you no longer have the account.    The only thing related to Barclays in my pocket now is the Ameriprise World Elite MC which is only serviced by Barclays.  Low interest rate but the only thing is the annual fee which is cheap if you travel a lot (there is a big thread on CB about this card).  In any case, say goodbye to Barclays and don&amp;#039;t look back.
