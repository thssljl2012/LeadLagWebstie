         UPDATED  Sun Aug 24 2008 10:15:22         Yeah, it&amp;#039;s Valhalla...    The US has eight already on the team, with Azinger still to pick four wildcards:    1. Phil Mickelson  2. Stewart Cink  3. Kenny Perry  4. Jim Furyk  5. Anthony Kim  6. Justin Leonard  7. Ben Curtis  8. Boo Weekley     That in itself isn&amp;#039;t a bad team---at least name-wise. However, there are three rookies and two players (Curtis and Weekley) who have been very mediocre this year and only made the team due to good rounds in recent events. Weekley can&amp;#039;t putt worth a sh-t, so he&amp;#039;s not to be counted on there. And which Phil Mickelson will show up, Good Phil or Bad Phil?    As for the four wildcards, Azinger will anounce those picks on Spetember 2nd...and may include one or two more rookies. The four most likely picks are Rocco Mediate, DJ Trahan, Hunter Mahan, and Woody Austin. However, Azinger has stated on a few occasions that his picks will be the hottest players going into the event, so the first two Fedex Playoff events could be very telling. Mahan has had a strong showing thus far at the Barclays, even though he probably won&amp;#039;t win. Of course, he made the &amp;amp;quot;slavery&amp;amp;quot; comment about the Ryder Cup a few weeks ago..so we&amp;#039;ll see if that affects Azinger&amp;#039;s views at all.
