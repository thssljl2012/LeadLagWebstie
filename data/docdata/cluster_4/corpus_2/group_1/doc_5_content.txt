 Speak to Barclays HO, and make it an official complaint - they should be able to tell you where/when the card was used (or mistakenly debited)  and credit back any fee&amp;#039;s that may&amp;#039;ve been incurred due to being overdrawn - you may also get some kind of compensation IF it was a barclays error - but chances are it wasn&amp;#039;t!!      However, that being said, I&amp;#039;ve banked with Barclays for 17 years - never banked anywhere else.  Up until the last two months I was able to use telephone banking as well as online etc etc.  But as I said, my telephone banking hadn&amp;#039;t been working and when I called up for something else - I happened to mention this - i was advised that my pin number for phone banking had been incorrectly entered and was therefore blocked    - i was then advised that this had happened in................. 2006!         I was quite gobsmacked and asked why on earth if this happened in 2006, was my account not stopped then for telephone banking - my advisor was not sure of this!!!  Amazing
