It&amp;#039;s againsts Barclays, who after 11 weeks of waiting were still unable to provide me with a response and had no idea of when they would be able to provide one.  I informed Barclays that I had complained to the FOS and they just said ok, I still haven&amp;#039;t had anything at all from Barclays regarding my claim for mis-selling.
