    Here are a few of Aussie commercials.         The first is one of my favourites. It&amp;#039;s for the Commonwealth Bank and it&amp;#039;s showing an American Ad agency pitching their ideas for ads for the bank (bear with me, here.) There are a handful of different ones done in this theme, but this one is my favourite. I like when he says &amp;amp;quot;Go danciiing&amp;amp;quot; and calls New Zealand &amp;amp;quot;She banga bang.&amp;amp;quot; Cracks me up every time. If you know anything about New Zealand, they have a lot of sheep which explains all of the sheep in the presentation.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx_kxp3R2oU         This ad is for lamb (the meat.) It&amp;#039;s really funny if you can pick up all of the lamb and cooking puns.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sk5Q6cDoZCg         Here&amp;#039;s another Australian ad, but this is one that absolutely gets on my nerves. I don&amp;#039;t know about you guys, but since it&amp;#039;s the Olympics most of the commercials here are patriotic in nature. Here&amp;#039;s one for McDonalds. I have no idea what the Golden Arches has to do with being Australian or the Olympics, but just the whole contrived nature of the ad gives me the irrates.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPhmBsd2Gwc
