 Have bitten the bullet and bought mine on Saturday. Loving it so far and the 10 or so Apps I think I&amp;#039;ll use. Trouble is, I&amp;#039;ve ignored my family for 48 hours. The novelty of checking the web while hiding from the kids in the shed hasn&amp;#039;t worn off yet.    All this and I haven&amp;#039;t even used the phone aspect as waiting for my PAC code to come through.    O2 tried pushing the insurance on me, but Barclays have confirmed they cover it under my Additions account, so will cancel the insurance now.    Now just weighing up whether to Jailbreak or not... any major disadvantages?
