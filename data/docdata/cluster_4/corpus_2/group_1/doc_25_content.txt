 I found this little paragraph in our local paper this morning:       Bikes over wives       Here&amp;#039;s a heartwarming tidbit from the world of wheels: A recent survey by Allstate Insurance Co. of 500 male motorcycle riders nationwide found &amp;amp;quot;virtually all&amp;amp;quot; of those who classified themselves as hardcore bikers would give up their spouse before they gave up their motorcycle. Among the hard-core bikers&amp;#039; top-five favorite cruising songs: &amp;amp;quot;Born to be Wild&amp;amp;quot; by Steppenwolf and &amp;amp;quot;Freebird&amp;amp;quot; by Lynyrd Skynyrd.       Who said romance - and good taste - are dead in America?         Thankfully John said he&amp;#039;d give up A bike for me!    (but he&amp;#039;d still have 2!)
