Medical costs should not directly impact your finances however. Hospitals have an obligation to treat any patient, but that is often just what it takes to get them out the door.      There is no solution that I have come across nationwide. I think most people who bring elderly parents over are either hopeful, do not consider the issues or from countries where they are no better off.                        Don&amp;#039;t want Mass then...      It&amp;#039;s just a requirement you have medical insurance, not medical cover...and if you don&amp;#039;t have insurance, they take it out of your taxes and if your  employer doesn&amp;#039;t offer it, you can get basic coverage off the state, which wouldn&amp;#039;t cover an aspirin at the ER.      Maybe B2 and come over for six month stretches? My mother just came for the week and travel medical insurance was 25 squid, something from Barclays because of a savings account I think.
