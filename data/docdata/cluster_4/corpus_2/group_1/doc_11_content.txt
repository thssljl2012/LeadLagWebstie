Much as I&amp;#039;m disgusted with Barclays I&amp;#039;m not going to cut off my nose etc.  Did you manage then to find a better/same as payer, and if so, who was it?  Would love to stick it to Barclays twice, once costing them on the Ombudsman and again by transferring the money out!                      I transferred mine to Newcastle  ISA+  whose current rate is 6% on amounts of 3000 and above.      Barclays is currently 6.25% AER including bonus, or 6.08% p.a.      The way I looked at it is, because of the bonus only lasting 12 months then I would transfer out at the end of 12 months when the rate drops, therefore I would never get 6.25% AER anyway which is the compounded rate if you leave your interest in.  But the rate drops after the 12 months anyway, so does anyone actually get 6.25%?      Looking at it that way, the actual loss of interest is only 6.08% down to 6% and 0.08% isn&amp;#039;t really anything to worry about!      Hope you can understand my logic.
