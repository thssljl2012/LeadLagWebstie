So what is it, a machine or something    I&amp;#039;m not a Barclay&amp;#039;s customer, just trying to figure out what this is and how it works...                        It&amp;#039;s a little device, that looks like a miniature calculator, about the size of a credit card, just thicker. You put your debit card in a slot at the top and enter your pin. It then generates some kind of number that you need to add in your transfer instructions in addition to the usual details of where the money is going, etc.      Clever, but a little bit of a hassle, really.
