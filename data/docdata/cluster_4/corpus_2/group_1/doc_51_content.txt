ALSO my first option was co-op and they turned me down the feckers!             Are the campaign doing flyers?  If so, you can go in and have a look through the brochures, accidentally leaving a flyer in every pack you look in.  You can go in and raise the matter (loud embarrassing voice) with the staff.  While you use the counter, you can stick a flyer to the front so the staff don&amp;#039;t see it, but the customers do.  If they close your account, inform the banking ombudsman - even if they find in the banks favour it will have taken up a senior manager&amp;#039;s time.  You can write on each cheque &amp;amp;quot;Barclays support animal abuse&amp;amp;quot;.  Etc. _________________ 4,11,12, remain - take your pick:         http://www.veganfitness.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=14963
