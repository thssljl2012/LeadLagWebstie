WTH?      Nothing has changed since they approved me for this card. Are they just now looking at my credit reports. I&amp;#039;m done with this second class banking institution. I&amp;#039;m not only sending them their card cut up with all the original paperwork, but I&amp;#039;m sending them a FOAD (now that I know what that means) letter. I dont need that bullcrap. I&amp;#039;m creditworthy and none of my balances are high. They&amp;#039;re probably ticked because I haven&amp;#039;t used the card yet. Sigh. Whatever&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;        Sorry to hear about this, shoediva. I need to use my card. I rarely use it. Don&amp;#039;t want them closing it for inactivity.     I dont know if inactivity is the reason since the reason they&amp;#039;re shoving me is too many open accounts. I have so many cards at this point, Barclay is becoming an annoyance. I&amp;#039;m wondering if its even worth the effort of asking for a recon.      You&amp;#039;ll have to figure out if Juniper fits within your plans. Juniper seems very robotic. I&amp;#039;d be surprised if they moved off their position. But you should probably give it a try. There is no downside to trying.
