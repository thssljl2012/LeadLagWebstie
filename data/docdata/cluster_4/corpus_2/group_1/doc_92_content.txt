We used to hold and HSBC GBP account and use Custom House for our FX transactions. It was a pain using HSBC, far easier using an overseas bank, such as Barclays, Custom House just take it out using a Direct Debit Mandate and deposit it in $CAD into the designated account.                        Our GBP account was in Canada, which is what made it silly, we had to go into the branch to do a transfer to Custom House for them to do the exchange, whereas from a UK bank account it can all be processed by Custom House using a direct debit manadate.
