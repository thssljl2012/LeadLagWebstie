 It&amp;#039;s just getting even worse. I have an agreement to pay back my Barclays loan at 8 per month. I&amp;#039;ve been sticking to this arrangement, but their collections company phones me 3x a day hassling me for more. Now &amp;#039;ve got letter telling me that if I don&amp;#039;t pay the lot (close to 4k) by return, they&amp;#039;ll take me to court.       One of my other creditors recently got a CCJ against me and now I&amp;#039;m in an even worse position than I was. The figure they came up with is pie-in-the-sky and I&amp;#039;ve had to ask my parents to help me pay it otherwise I&amp;#039;ll get bailiffs round.      I&amp;#039;ve sent financial statements, food bills, payslips, rent statements, bank statements... and still they can&amp;#039;t accept that I cannot pay more. They have my financial facts in black and white. I cannot give them more. I&amp;#039;m not sitting on a stack of money and refusing to pay. What more can I do?
