    hi,hope someone can help. 5 years and 8 months ago we walked into barclays and closed our account, we were told to pay whatever was owing in charges, which we did there and then and was told the account was closed, now we have just recieved a letter saying we are overdrawn by 47 and are been charged 22 for every five days we are overdrawn. we have had no letters or anyhing in the last five years. my husband phoned them and has asked for all transactions and copies of paperwork (the say they sent us) since January 2002. As the account was &amp;amp;quot;closed&amp;amp;quot; five years ago we now have no statements or any record of the bank account number or anything. we just wondered where we stood on this. thanks
