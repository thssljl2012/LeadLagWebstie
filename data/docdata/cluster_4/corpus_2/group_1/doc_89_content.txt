  Maybe an overly dramatic title (sorry). All starts on April 6th     First question...     Transferred a Bradford&amp;amp;amp;Bingley ISA to nationwide. They received the cheque on May 23rd  Also transferred (or am trying to transfer) a Barclays ISA to them but      Barclays say they have never even had a request for it     So at the moment Nationwide are sitting on the B&amp;amp;amp;B cheque and say they cannot open the ISA until they get the barlcays cheque (since the application was made for both ISA&amp;#039;s together)     Must have made about 30 calls to nationwide, asking them to re-request the Barlcays Isa. Nothing    Promises of &amp;#039;callbacks within 48 hours&amp;#039; are never kept.  Letters are not acknoweldged.       Upon further investigation it seems that each time I have been told &amp;amp;quot;yes, we&amp;#039;ll send another request to Barclays&amp;amp;quot;, they have been talking rubbish - there is absolutely no record of those requests      I received a letter on July 21st saying &amp;amp;quot;Thank you for your letter....blah blah...we will give you a detailed response by Augst 17th&amp;amp;quot;     Then I received an identical letter on July 24th saying &amp;amp;quot;Thank you for your letter....blah blah...we will give you a detailed response by August 27th&amp;amp;quot;     I have managed to pin down a real person at my local branch who says that if the complaint is not resolved by the 17th August (date the first letter promises), then I can escalate the complaint to Level 2, which involves it being dealt with by a &amp;#039;senior manager&amp;#039;, after which time if it is not dealt with I can proceed directly to the banking ombudsman     Trouble is, she was unable to tell me how long they have to deal with a &amp;amp;quot;Level 2&amp;amp;quot; complaint.  Yup - a senior customer service manager was unable to tell me their organisations agreed lead time for dealing with a complaint.     How long do I wait?  How long does the ombudsman give the bank to sort out a problem before they take it on?    I&amp;#039;m in the position now where Nationwide have me by the short and curlies.  I cannot go to another provider because the bradford and bingley cheque is being held by them.  If I was to walk away from natiowide, how the hell would I explain to a new provider the situation, and how competent do you think nationwide would be to give them the B&amp;amp;amp;B cheque.    Second question.....     The first cheque was recieved by Nationwide on May 23rd.    The second cheque has yet to be received.     nationwide say that the the new ISA&amp;#039;s will start when the second cheque is received.     So at the moment I have lost about 80 days worth of interest.  If Nationwide drag their feet for another x days, thats interest I&amp;#039;m losing     Given that I have done absolutely everything in my power (numerous calls each month, letters), you&amp;#039;d think the ombudsman would find in my favour, no?     I don&amp;#039;t especially want &amp;#039;compensation&amp;#039; - just to have all interest that is owed to me.  And then I never ever ever EVER EVER want to have any dealings with nationwide again.     Sorry for the rant, I hope someone can offer advice, or even sympathy.  GP
