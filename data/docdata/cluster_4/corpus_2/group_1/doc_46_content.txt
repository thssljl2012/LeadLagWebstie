He is hoping they come and have a go, it&amp;#039;s a psychological message he&amp;#039;s sending to Keegan, because Ferguson fears they will come and put all they have behind the ball.      With Rooney lacking sharpness, combined with our other injuries/suspensions/absentees,  Newcastle may just scrape a draw if they were to be defensive.                       We&amp;#039;re talking about Newcastle here, their best defender is Steven Taylor. If they go for a draw they&amp;#039;ll get beaten comfortably and it will be a fairly easy match for us.
