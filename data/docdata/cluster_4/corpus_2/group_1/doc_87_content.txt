 Thanks for the advice.  I am in NO WAY saying I think they are a great Insurance company.  ONLY that they are saving me a ton of money, and since I haven&amp;#039;t had any accidents, I am one of the guys paying for everyone else&amp;#039;s mishaps.       All my vehicles are paid for, none newer than a 2000 Explorer.  I drive 5 mph below the speed limits, sometimes slower.  I pull over for faster drivers.  I have 25 years of Defensive Drivers Training from being a retired P/O.  I DO know I could have an accident, and may only get one claim out of them.  I&amp;#039;ll roll those dice.
