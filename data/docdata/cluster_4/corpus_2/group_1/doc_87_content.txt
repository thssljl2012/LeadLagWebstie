 I was recently in an accident.  Other driver was 100% at fault (ran a red light) and the other drivers insurance company (Nationwide) has accepted liability.  My question is, they have told me that my 2008 CBR 600RR is a total loss (major damage to the sub frame and swingarm).  How much should I expect to get back on it?  It was less than two months old, but it did have over 2000 miles on it.  Should I expect MSRP, what I paid, market value?
