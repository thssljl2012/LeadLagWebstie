Yes that happened to me....I forgot that bit and it was they who said to send a photocopy of the form. Barclay never mentioned it.      No I don&amp;#039;t feel guilty about going bankrupt, best thing I ever did BUT there&amp;#039;s a difference between going bankrupt and complaining to the powers that be of methods used by a company who at the end of the day just want their money back.      I just feel....I think....a bit cheeky but then on the otherhand they are harassing and claim they are not. If they had said yep we did, sorry about that, I wouldn&amp;#039;t take it further, but to claim innocence when it&amp;#039;s obviously company policy is not on.              Nancy
