 If you think that&amp;#039;s bad, NOW First Plus (Barclays) is trying to claw back commissions paid to brokerages back to 2006!!  Barclays has lawyers looking over contracts signed with brokerages...going over them with a fine toothed comb and are now trying to CLAW BACK commissions on cases that completed over the past two years, but then went on to remortgage.  How great is that??  Just hope you are not affected by this...but seriously, how low can they go??
