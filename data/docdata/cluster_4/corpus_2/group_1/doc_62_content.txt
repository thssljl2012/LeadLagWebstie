When Visa Signature or Platinum Plus cardholders make $25,000 in net purchases, or more, each calendar year, 10,000 of those Dividend Miles earned will be counted as Preferred Miles. Preferred Miles will be converted 6 to 8 weeks after the purchase requirement has been met.                       Question: Who has experience with this feature of the BofA cards?  6 to 8 weeks seems to be a long time.  Is it really that long?      With Juiper/Barclays Mastercards, the 10K preferred conversion happens at the same time miles post, following the closing date which I exceeded $25K annual spend.
