 A Viper is hard to total? You sure your on the right forum?  We wreak these things weekly. Its probabley one of the easiest cars to put away.       This guy doesnt look like any newbie either- looks like hes had his fair share of Vipers which mentions to say he SOLD them.             Anways...Sorry man- been there myself, learned from it and bought another...
