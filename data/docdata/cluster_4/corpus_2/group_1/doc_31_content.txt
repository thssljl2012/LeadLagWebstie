 From the Daily Mail (BBC also carrying the story) -           Quote:                         Thaskin Shinawatra is preparing to stand down from the board of Manchester City under pressure from the Premier League&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;fit and proper person&amp;#039; test.      City confirmed on Friday night that financially-stricken Thaksin is currently trying to sell part of his stake in the club as he looks for funds to bolster the efforts of manager Mark Hughes in the transfer market.      In an extraordinary interview, City executive chairman Garr Cook admitted that the controversial Thai politician is &amp;#039;embarrassed&amp;#039; about the controversy he has attracted and is preparing to step down as the Barclays Premier League continue to examine whether he meets their guidelines for ownership.      Cook said: &amp;#039;Dr Thaksin has been really open about this. He has said to me: &amp;amp;quot;If you need me to resign from the football club as a director then I&amp;#039;m fine with that as long as that doesn&amp;#039;t change any other thing.&amp;amp;quot;      &amp;#039;This is one of the reasons why we would look to maybe take him off the board as a director. We&amp;#039;re talking about a lot of different things right now.&amp;#039;      Cook met Premier League chairman Sir David Richards this week and is fully aware that - with Thaksin currently on the run from court charges in Thailand - the English game is concerned about the harm the City owner may be doing to its reputation.      It is known that several other Premier League chairmen do not believe Thaksin should be allowed to continue to head up City while League chief executive Richard Scudamore also has grave misgivings.      League rules state that any individual found guilty of corruption charges cannot sit on a club board and also has to transfer part of his stake to another individual.      Cook added: &amp;#039;I think there is a very loose term about what is &amp;amp;quot;fit and proper.&amp;amp;quot; It is almost a tongue-incheek term that you would use for Premier League football over the last 10 years.      &amp;#039;There are plenty of unfit and improper individuals. &amp;#039;But what I want to do with Sir David is make sure that we get it cleared up. We are restructuring the board.      &amp;#039;We have talked about selling part of his stake to an equity partner who would come in and take a little bit of the pressure away from him so that the Premier League would get more comfort out of it.      &amp;#039;Dr Thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities - the club, the Premier League. He never intended this. &amp;#039;We&amp;#039;ve talked about so many different options. But one thing we are adamant about is not to give up the majority stake-holding.&amp;#039;      With Thaksin&amp;#039;s 800m fortune frozen in Thailand, City have finally admitted the former Thai prime minister is not able to bankroll the club as he originally promised.      A recen t30m bank loan-secured against future TV and ticket revenue - has eased the pressure on a club that has had to borrow millions from former owner John Wardle to ease cash flow problems.      But Cook admitted last night that it now needs an injection of fresh capital from a new investor if manager Hughes is to add to his squad in the transfer window.       Cook said: &amp;#039;It will be resolved in the next 10 days. It might not be the selling of a stake it might just be  well, we have got five or six different options.      &amp;#039;The reason we want to do that is because we are in the transfer window with 11 days left and we need three or four players. It will help us improve Mark&amp;#039;s squad.&amp;#039;       Thaksin is living in London but has been advised by security experts not to come to City home games, starting with West Ham on Sunday.                     Hold on to your hats folks, the next week is gonna be interesting to say the least!!!
