                        Wow!&amp;amp;nbsp; I thought exactly the opposite.&amp;amp;nbsp; She&amp;#039;s f*ckin&amp;#039; cute!&amp;amp;nbsp; Admittedly, not typical, though.&amp;amp;nbsp; Certainly not typical of television commercial women.&amp;amp;nbsp; Looks kind of east coast to me.&amp;amp;nbsp; Maybe Jewish.&amp;amp;nbsp; Possibly Italian, too, but my first impression was &amp;quot;Jewish&amp;quot;.&amp;amp;nbsp; I also thought &amp;quot;Greenwich Village poet/artist, circa 1970&amp;quot;, but that might just be me reading too much into it.&amp;amp;nbsp;     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Here she is:    &amp;amp;nbsp;                &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;
