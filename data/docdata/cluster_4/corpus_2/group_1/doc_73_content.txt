  No, none of the above. No distraction or anyone lurking. Covered my pin. Wife right near me. Waited till transaction concluded each time and card spat out.    No &amp;amp;quot;written statement&amp;amp;quot; taken. My bank have acted on my behalf in launching the claim against Barclays. Apparently, when this comes back negative it sometimes gets reversed when repeated. Sounds like playing for time to me.    So I guess I have to lodge a complaint with the financial ombudsman then.
