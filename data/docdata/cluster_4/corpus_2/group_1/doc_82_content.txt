Save your escaped gorillas and Spaz tests for your adolescent story telling. Since when were you chosen to represent anything much less Vipers? Your words of wisdom show us all what you really represent. Now go ahead and spew some more on someone&amp;#039;s bad misfortune.                      Lighten up and remember; I was not the one who broke the law and thrashed my Viper. It&amp;#039;s not as if a lightning bolt hit his car. &amp;amp;quot;Thrasher&amp;amp;quot; did it all on his own and on public roads. I think he is the kind of guy to learn his lesson and hope he will not do the same in the future. You, on the other hand need to work on #9 on my suggestion tips list. Your seething anger suggests that you are all bottled up and long overdue for release.
