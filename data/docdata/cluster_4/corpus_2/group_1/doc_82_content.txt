 They now sell sage and its clearly explained that you don&amp;#039;t have to pay for the software and you can have a basic account without it, and they give away half a dozen other ones as well.  The sage does come with sage support and you are contacted by sage and given an account manager, so whilst in the past they might have done something wrong at present they aint, or they aint in this part of the world.
