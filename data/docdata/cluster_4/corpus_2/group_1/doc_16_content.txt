If you buy another one, I would suggest that you take some driving classes, get medicated and/or take it to a track that can handle some speed. Public roads were not designed for handling over 1.1 g&amp;#039;s of cornering speed.       I&amp;#039;m beginning to think that Dodge needs to require its patrons to take a &amp;amp;quot;Spaz Test&amp;amp;quot; before letting them take delivery of these cars. Spaz out and you are denied.                      Give him a break already, can you imagine how he feels?
