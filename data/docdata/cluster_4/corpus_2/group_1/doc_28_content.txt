  A CUSTOMER who had a barney with his bank changed his account  password to Lloyds is Pants  only for them to switch it to &amp;quot;No We Are Not.   Steve Jetley, 52, used the cheeky keyword for phone and online banking for two years.   But now he is having another set-to with Lloyds TSB after discovering staff  had changed it without his permission. Computer consultant Steve came up  with the pants password ribbing after blaming Lloyds over a holiday  insurance muddle which left him with a 1,200 bill after a skiing accident.   He said: It was half joke, half protest and Lloyds staff usually burst out laughing when I used it.   But Steve  a customer for 20 years  was fuming when he called the  Lloyds TSB business centre in Birmingham and discovered it had been changed.   He demanded it be re-set to Lloyds is Rubbish. When told that was inappropriate,  he tried Barclays is Better.   After another rejection, he went for Censorship but was told it could only be six letters.   When he finally suggested Faeces he was informed new rules meant the  characters had to be numbers, not letters.   Dad-of-one Steve, of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, then lodged a complaint.   Yesterday Lloyds confirmed a staff member broke banking rules by  changing a customers password without consent.   They said the employee no longer worked at the centre but would not say if she had been fired.   A spokesman said: We apologise to Mr Jetley.   Steve said: I havent registered a new password yet  Im still trying to think of one I can get past the censors.   Should the employee who changed Mr Jetley&amp;#039;s pants password be given the sack?  Should we have the right to choose any password we wish to even if its a rude one?
