  Only...  HSBC/First Direct OR  RBS/Natwest    (and of course Barclays!)    Can send AND receive by faster payments at present with LTSB out of commission    In addition    A&amp;amp;amp;L ,  Halifax,  Some Co-op branches in the North can receive    ..but sending? doubt it?     One or two Nationwide customers with a certain sort code are understood to be able to receive (but probably not send)- certainly 99.9&amp;amp;#37; of NW customers  can&amp;#039;t  at present.    Other banks can&amp;#039;t do either receive or send....
