                        I not only don&amp;#039;t think she&amp;#039;s ugly, I actually think she&amp;#039;s typically too GOOD LOOKING.   &amp;amp;nbsp;    I for one would welcome seeing more normal looking people on TV both in commercials &amp;amp;amp; TV shows as well.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    The problem with TV is that whether good looking or not, the people they put on TV&amp;amp;nbsp;tend&amp;amp;nbsp;to be ANNOYING looking.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    They seem to go for people who have a look about them that just makes you (or me anyway) want to smack them across their faces.&amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;
