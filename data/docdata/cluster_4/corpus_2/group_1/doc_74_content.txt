    Hi Everyone        This is my first post, I&amp;#039;m abit nervous but here goes with my tale of disaster.        I have been reading this forum, as many before me no doubt, with a sense of relief as it has dispelled many of my irrational fears and inaccurate hearsays that surround insolvency.         However, there are still, Im sorry to admit, quite a few question marks hanging over my predicament as my situation seems to me at least abit more complicated than some. Im hoping that if I post the whole thing up here, some of you good &amp;amp;amp; helpful people will shed some light into the corners where Im still frightened of the unknown unknowns as Mr Rumsfeldt was so fond of saying.         The background to my situation is pretty standard though: own construction business, profitable, trading over 6 years then projects started drying up, tenders postponed/cancelled/not won  begin to over trade to compensate and start losing money  re-invest to keep show on road, this drought cant last forever, can it?  eventually have to throw in towel as overdraft maxed out, credit cards maxed out, etc etc. Another small business statistic and another set of dreams, hopes and hard graft up in smoke and I still can&amp;#039;t help thinking where it it go wrong, why did I stop doing things right?         Though I might mention here before anyone says how have you survived financially since? that before I finally called time on my business in January this year I had got myself another job the previous July, so my mortgage and the interest payments on credit cards and other stuff was being serviced.        But only just, and although I havent had to endure the awful attentions as so many of you have of bailiffs and such, I have had an anxious wobble when a recent interim re-financing of my current account saw Barclays screw up the direct debit payments with consequent telephone calls &amp;amp;amp; letters automatically triggered once the payments had failed. I was shocked how quickly &amp;amp;amp; how hotly the credit departments of various suppliers were on my case.         Formally pulling the plug on my business of course meant that the company overdraft became payable on demand and critically its secured as a second charge on my house.          Inexplicably my bank has been extremely understanding in the circumstances, so far. I had to put my house on the market in April at its valuation of July the previous year - 500,000  and had hoped that I would have been able to sell it by now. But the housing market crash allied to the credit crunch has halted all sales activity and especially in the case of pretty but remote cottages in the depths of the countryside.         Adding to my woes is that the Environment Agency now has an online flood warning graphic that shows every property in the land that could be at risk from flooding. And mine has a small river running right through the garden, so you can imagine how that looks! Its a further dis-incentive to prospective buyers  even though the house only got marginally wet during 2007s catastrophic floods.         Anyway, what has propelled me faster than anything towards BR is the dramatic fall in equity I have sustained since I decided to sell. The property is now worth approx only 380,000 according to my experienced and trusted agent, and is still rapidly losing value. With a mortgage of 325,000, the company debt of 100,000 and 50,000 of other unsecured debt, it doesnt take a maths genius to see that in the space of a few months I have become technically bankrupt. I owe more than I am worth, period and in becoming so am now eligible for bankruptcy. Whats more, as the economic situation deteriorates, interest rates increasing along with the cost of living, and the constriction of credit all-round, I am slowly suffocating in debt. It is beginning to impact on my realtionship with my OH and I do not want to fall into the trap on indecision. I know theres now only one way out of this.         But now I come to the tricky bits, the unknown unknowns that are the outcomes I am still in the dark about. I am going to list my concerns here in full. I would like to apologise in advance if some of my queries are obvious or nonsensical, but if anyone can throw even a smidgin of light on it, its a help  and may well assist other people downstream if they&amp;#039;ve managed to read this far.       Right here goes:         First, I would like to clear up one thing. I am pretty positive that bankruptcy is the right solution for me, not an IVA or any other type of debt management plan. In a nutshell I cannot afford an IVA or the IP that perforce come with them, am I correct?          Second, as part of the unwritten procedure in seeking bankruptcy, should I be following a path of some sort? Eg. I should have a meeting with my bank to explain my predicament and make an offer of some sort, but would I be expected by the Judge to have seen others too, like my mortgage holders the C&amp;amp;amp;G and my credit card companies? Advice here particularly please.         Third query concerns my house. I do not, in fact, live in it but it does have long term tenants in residence. What would happen to their tenancy agreement? What if they refuse to move? Do they have any legal right to remain?         Fourth, the home I actually live in belongs, (and always has done) to my wife. I am assuming this would be exempt in any bankruptcy order, even though I contribute towards its upkeep which I shall have to reflect in my SOA.         Fifth, and regarding SOAs. If I can prove that my outgoings, even shorn of my debt burden, leave very little surplus, will the Judge impose some repayment schedule irrespectively? My shortfall will arise mostly because I will have to re-house my tenants (dependent relatives who run my house as a b &amp;amp;amp; b &amp;amp;amp; will lose their income if made homeless) and I no doubt I will have to provide them with some on-going income as well until they get back on their feet.         Six, my bank accounts will be frozen, I realize. My employers have kindly agreed to pay my salary elsewhere when necessary and since my car is company owned, I will retain that presumably. The consensus in this forum seems to be that Barclays or Nationwide or the Co-op are the only sanctuaries for undischarged bankrupts. Since my creditor bank is Barclays anyway, I doubt they will be keen to continue to harbour me, so of the two remaining, which would be my best bet? Or would I be better off sharing my OH HSBC bank account (if thats possible?) since then at least I would, I imagine, be able to maintain DDs and SOs and have online facilities.         And thats it, I think. If there are other issues I have missed out inadvertently, please can someone point this out?        Thanks to all of you who have read this whole diatribe. Any helpful comments would be gratefully received.
