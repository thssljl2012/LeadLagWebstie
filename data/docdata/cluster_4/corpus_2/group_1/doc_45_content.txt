They closed with a &amp;amp;#036;0 balance.   I called but they wouldn&amp;#039;t budge. The total number of cards they claimed I&amp;#039;ve opened since the beginning of the year is 14, but I think thats a bit extreme. Its probably more like 10.   At any rate, I have NO intention of EVER applying for another Barclay product again. They&amp;#039;ve lost a customer for life behind this foolishness.     Have you checked your reports lately?  When they pulled their nonsense on me they pulled hards on all three CRAs.     Yes and no. I check my reports through CS. I was checking them through so many portals that it didn&amp;#039;t even make sense. I cut a lot of that out. Now its just CS and CK for the B*. No hard pull. They said something about TU. I should go through the backdoor to see if they did hit me with a hard. I&amp;#039;m thinking no, because it would have showed up by now on CS. I&amp;#039;m thinking its a soft since it was an AR. Regardless, I have no intent to EVA and I do mean EVA apply for any type of credit with those clowns again&amp;amp;#33;
