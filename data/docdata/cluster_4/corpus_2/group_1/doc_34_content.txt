If he plays well at the Barclays and the Deutsche Bank Championship, Azinger will have to think twice about not taking Mahan as a Captain&amp;#039;s pick - regardless of his perception of Mahan&amp;#039;s comments.  (Not to mention how ironic and/or hypocritical it would be for Azinger to exclude Mahan for being outspoken.)                      Captain Azinger is making his selections based on performance.  The PGA Championship was the last Major prior to the Ryder Cup.  What did Hunter Mahan do at the PGA?  That was his nail in the coffin. It has nothing to do with what he said or did not say.  It has everything to do with his performance under pressure.  He wilted, and then went home for the weekend.  For those of you who did not follow the high scorers, he shot 81 and 79.
