Disclaimer: I was a Lloyds customer for about 10 years before I moved to the US.  If he thinks Barclays is so much better why doesn&amp;#039;t he bank with them instead?  I&amp;#039;m sure they&amp;#039;d enjoy raping him with Barclaycard charges.  Anyway, this is certainly his phone banking &amp;quot;password&amp;quot; which has to be stored so that the drone on the other end of the line can check it.  The website password is completely separate. When I used it the Lloyds drone asked you for certain letters from the passphrase rather than having you repeat the whole thing over the phone. They couldn&amp;#039;t do that with a non-reversible encryption.  You also weren&amp;#039;t allowed to pick the same password for the phone and online banking (at least you couldn&amp;#039;t when I was a customer).  They made you pick a longer phrase so that it would be harder for people to guess you password having heard certain letters from it.
