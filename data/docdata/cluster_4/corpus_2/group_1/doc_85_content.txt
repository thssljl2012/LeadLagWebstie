I agree that you should just take the tube from Heathrow to your hotel, instead of taking the Heathrow Express.  You won&amp;#039;t save much time by taking the Heathrow Express, and you&amp;#039;ll spend lots more &amp;amp;pound; for that.  Just follow the directions Robes has given you.    If you&amp;#039;re going to return to the UK in the next couple of years, you&amp;#039;re better off keeping the &amp;amp;pound; and just get &amp;amp;euro; from an ATM after you arrive in Paris.  Everytime you change currency, you lose $.  So to change $ -&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;pound; -&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;euro;, you lose twice.    There is a Barclays ATM at Heathrow tube station (just before you enter the tube station).    Lastly, for the Paris Museum Pass, you&amp;#039;ll have to do the math yourself to see if you&amp;#039;ll come out ahead.  The benefit of having the Pass, is that for the big museums like Louvre and Orsay, you can always leave the museum after 2-3 hours, then go back the next day and tackle another section.  OTOH, if you are just paying admission for one day, you feel obligated to cram it all down on one day, which is not the most pleasant thing to do sometimes.
