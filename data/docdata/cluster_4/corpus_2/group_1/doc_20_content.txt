 Now that you&amp;#039;ve been dropped take some time and do some shopping.  Check out sites like JD Powers, Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poors and Consumer Reports.  You&amp;#039;ll see many of the same insurance companies rated at the top of their lists in terms of customer satisfaction year after year.  There&amp;#039;s clue number one.  Amica always seems to be up.  If yer military, you might consider USAA.  Other pointers to consider are, skip using an agent if you can.  They&amp;#039;re usually middle men who often do nothing more than suck money out of yer pocket.  A lot of insurance agents are bagging 10 - 15% of your insurance premiums each year.  On life insurance and other financial service products they can suck out a lot more.  That&amp;#039;s one reason why GEICO, Progressive and other direct writers have snagged such a big chunk of market share in the past 10 years.  If yer an NRA guy, you might want to avoid Progressive.  The honchos in that outfit are reported to be very anti-gun rights.  They&amp;#039;re also one of the industry leaders in the use of used and aftermarket parts.  Lastly, consider shopping every year.  Most folks switch to a company and never bother to shop later on.  The guy who started this thread said he paid over $20k in premiums.  Too bad for him.  If you woulda done some shopping over the years, that amount would&amp;#039;ve been considerably lower.  There&amp;#039;s a boat load of insurance companies out there and they all want yer money.  Don&amp;#039;t be afraid to shop on a regular basis and buy direct if you can...
