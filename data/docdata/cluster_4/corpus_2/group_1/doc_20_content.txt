  What type of credit search is it? If it is just an enquiry or identity search then it has no bearing upon your credit score as other lenders cannot see these searches and is therefore nothing to worry about. If it is a credit search for a current account etc. then you have grounds for complaint and by making an offical complaint quoting FSA regulations would lead to them removing the search.     It is now common for banks and building societies to conduct credit searches however they are simply for identity and money laundering purposes and as i have already mentioned have no impact upon your credit score. These types of searches are to be expected if you are a new customer as your identity needs to be confirmed and this is another way in doing so in the fight against terrorism and money laundering.    Hope this helps  Rob    PS. I don&amp;#039;t work for barclays
