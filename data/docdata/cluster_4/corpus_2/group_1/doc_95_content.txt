 Thanks Nick...that looks to have done the trick for the internet side, they will apparently send me a new Userid, then I can reset the password.      Quite why the staff couldn&amp;#039;t have told me this I don&amp;#039;t know.      This means that I shall now be able to make my Lloyds account my &amp;amp;quot;main&amp;amp;quot; account, and finally ditch Barclays - though I shall keep the Barclays account open as a spare.      I have my ISA with Lloyds, and will be putting some of my redundancy money into it when i get it at the end of the month.      I have done quite well with my financial review this last month...even though all my bank account applications failed, I have got the LLoyds one ready anyhow. Plus I did manage to get two new credit cards with better interest rates and introductory deals.

I have been using Abbey&amp;#039;s service for years, and I am quite happy with it. Every now and then, at the most inopportune time, it will be unavailable, but it is rare.      Plus despite the fact that I can use it with Firefox, Abbey still doesn&amp;#039;t support it officially as a browser, and always gives me a warning before proceeding.                           I confess I didn&amp;#039;t try joining Abbey. Probably not worth it now, as they are clearly all going to turn me down.
