  The 120 days notice period only runs from the date when you knew the goods would not be delivered.  Barclays tried the same argument with me and I simply argued back and they are now investigating.  DO NOT let Barclays talk you down.  If you have paid by credit card, including Barclays Visa, the credit card company are jointly liabile under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act.  They cannot quote Visa Regulations at you and then deny that it is a Visa card.  They are likely to refund your money but you will have to argue for it.  As with anyone who is liable, they will initially try to dodge liability.     The website has now shut down and the email address  sales@summerfestivaltickets.com  is no longer valid.  We therefore have little option but to pursue our credit card issuers for a refund.  However, it is quite tempting to find the office of this guy and seek vigilante revenge!     Good luck to us all.
