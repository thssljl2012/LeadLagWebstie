                                  NT,     So I&amp;#039;m moving to London in 20 days and will be opening a bank account once I get there. Just wondering if any of you European or overseas people have a preference over one or the other. I remember HSBC, Barclays and RBS being huge the last time I was in Europe, so I&amp;#039;m leaning towards those. I also understand in the UK there really is no &amp;#039;fee&amp;#039; to open an account or use it, but one strictly for overdrafts and what not. Also, I&amp;#039;d like to consider their Internet services considering I&amp;#039;ll be moving $$$ from my KeyBank account in the States...     Thanks all in advance...                                                                                        T    E    A    M     C    L    E    V    E    L    A    N    D     C    A    V    S             WE   GOT RID OF LARRY HUGHES
