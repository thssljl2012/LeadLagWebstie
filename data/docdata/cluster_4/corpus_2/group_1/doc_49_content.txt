Quote:                         When I began hearing about the Bilderberg Group - about the notion that a tiny band of insidious and clandestine powermongers meet in a secret room from which they rule the world - I was sceptical. But I kept hearing about them, and I finally decided to try to settle the matter once and for all. Which is why I visited Big Jim Tucker. Within anti-Bilderberg circles, Big Jim is considered a pioneer, a trailblazer, risking his life to attempt to locate the geographical whereabouts of the secret room.      &amp;amp;quot;They exist all right,&amp;amp;quot; said Big Jim, &amp;amp;quot;and they&amp;#039;re not playing pinochle in there.&amp;amp;quot; Big Jim Tucker has spent 30 years documenting the facts. He&amp;#039;s been after them since the 70s when he first got the hunch that they existed. He abandoned a good career in sports journalism on a big city paper. It has been cat and mouse ever since, he said. Good against evil.      &amp;amp;quot;Those sick luminaries are always on the move,&amp;amp;quot; said Jim. &amp;amp;quot;They never come together in the same place twice, so as to evade detection. They only meet once a year, for a long weekend in May or June.&amp;amp;quot;      They have been ruling the world in secret since 1954, Jim said, when a man called Joseph Retinger, whose name rarely appears in the history books, decided to create them. One of many mysteries is how Retinger - a Polish immigrant employed as secretary to the novelist Joseph Conrad - had the wherewithal and the contacts to organise such a mighty endeavour. Their first meeting took place in the Bilderberg Hotel, Holland, which is why the secret rulers of the world go by the name of the Bilderberg Group. Big Jim said that I happened to have caught him at a very good time. He was ready to take things further, to turn up the heat and cause some trouble.      &amp;amp;quot;So you&amp;#039;ve actually managed to obtain the address of the next Bilderberg meeting?&amp;amp;quot; I asked Jim.      &amp;amp;quot;Yes, sir,&amp;amp;quot; he said.      &amp;amp;quot;You know exactly where it is?&amp;amp;quot; I asked.      &amp;amp;quot;Yes, I do,&amp;amp;quot; he said.      Big Jim said he fully intended to thwart their security and barge in unannounced to catch them red-handed going about their covert wickedness. I was welcome to tag along, he said, &amp;amp;quot;Just so long as you don&amp;#039;t step on twigs or fall off walls while we&amp;#039;re on the prowl.                             Quote:                         I am writing to you urgently to warn you about material being circulated about a &amp;#039;Bilderberg Conference&amp;#039; due to take place in June in Portugal. The Washington-based journal Spotlight is quoted as a source of information on the Bilderberg Conference. Spotlight is published by the fascist Liberty Lobby. The purpose of the material appears to be to make people imagine there is a sinister Jewish conspiracy that is trying to dominate the world. You may find much information on Spotlight by contacting any major anti-fascist organization.      Against fascism and against capitalism, Lisa Taylor (International Solidarity with Workers in Russia).      &amp;amp;quot;What do you think about that?&amp;amp;quot; said Fred.      There was a long silence.      &amp;amp;quot;Well,&amp;amp;quot; I said. &amp;amp;quot;I should tell you that the other night Jim told me it was a shame that Abraham Lincoln was an abolitionist.&amp;amp;quot;      &amp;amp;quot;Did he?&amp;amp;quot; said Fred, clearly startled.      &amp;amp;quot;But I can&amp;#039;t really think of anything else Jim said that might be construed as . . . oh, he did say that with the amount of pills they make him take for his plumbing, anyone would think he was . . .&amp;amp;quot;      &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re getting all our information from neo-Nazis?&amp;amp;quot; interrupted Fred. &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re publishing a newspaper all over Portugal and our sources are neo-Nazis?&amp;amp;quot;      &amp;amp;quot;You might be,&amp;amp;quot; I said. &amp;amp;quot;But that doesn&amp;#039;t mean . . .&amp;amp;quot; I paused.      Fred looked out at the pool. Children were splashing around. It was a lovely day. He put his head in his hands.      &amp;amp;quot;What,&amp;amp;quot; he said, &amp;amp;quot;have we got ourselves into?&amp;amp;quot;      In my attempts to find out whether the world really was being secretly ruled from inside the Caesar Park golfing resort that June weekend, I later contacted dozens of Bilderberg members. And, of course, nobody returned my calls. Nobody even wrote back to decline my request and thank me for my letter, and these are people whose people always write back and decline requests - Peter Mandelson&amp;#039;s office, for instance - which is why I began to envisage these silences as startled ones.      I did manage to speak to David Rockefeller&amp;#039;s press secretary, who told me that Mr Rockefeller was thoroughly fed up with being called a 12ft lizard, a secret ruler of the world, a keeper of black helicopters that spy on anti-Bilderberg dissenters, and so on.      The Rockefeller office seemed to have an encyclopaedic knowledge of the conspiracy theories. They troubled Mr Rockefeller (his press man said). They made him wonder why some people are so scared and suspicious of him, in particular, and global think-tanks such as Bilderberg in general. Mr Rockefeller&amp;#039;s conclusion was that this was a battle between rational and irrational thought. Rational people favoured globalisation. Irrational people preferred nationalism. I asked him why he thought no Bilderberg member had returned my calls or answered my letters. &amp;amp;quot;Well,&amp;amp;quot; he shrugged, &amp;amp;quot;I suppose it&amp;#039;s because they might want to be invited back.&amp;amp;quot;                             Quote:                         then, one Tuesday morning, the phone rang. It was the instantly recognisable voice of a Bilderberg founder member, for 30 years one of their inner circle, their steering committee, a Bilderberg agenda setter, a head-hunter - a secret ruler of the world himself, should you choose to believe the assorted militants I had spent the past five years with. It was Denis Healey.      &amp;amp;quot;How can I help you?&amp;amp;quot; he said.      &amp;amp;quot;Well,&amp;amp;quot; I said, &amp;amp;quot;would you tell me what happens inside Bilderberg meetings?&amp;amp;quot;      &amp;amp;quot;Okay,&amp;amp;quot; he said, cheerfully.      There was a silence.      &amp;amp;quot;Why?&amp;amp;quot; I said. &amp;amp;quot;Nobody else will.&amp;amp;quot;      &amp;amp;quot;Because you asked me,&amp;amp;quot; he said. Then he added, &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;#039;m an old fart. Come on over.&amp;amp;quot;      Once Lord Healey had agreed to talk to me - and I had circulated this information far and wide - other Bilderberg members became amenable, too (albeit on the condition of anonymity). These interviews enabled me to piece together the backstage mechanics of this most secret society.      So this is how it works. A tiny, shoe-string central office in Holland decides each year which country will host the next meeting. Each country has two steering committee members. (The British ones have included Lord Carrington, Denis Healey, Andrew Knight, the one-time editor of The Economist magazine, and Martin Taylor, the ex-CEO of Barclays Bank.)      They say that each country dreads their turn coming around, for they have to raise enough money to book an entire five-star hotel for four days (plus meals and transport and vast security - every packet of peas is opened and scrutinised, and so on). They call up Bilderberg-friendly global corporations, such as Xerox or Heinz or Fiat or Barclays or Nokia, which donate the hundreds of thousands of pounds needed. They do not accept unsolicited donations from non-Bilderberg corporations.      Nobody can buy their way into a Bilderberg meeting, although many corporations have tried. Then they decide who to invite - who seems to be a &amp;amp;quot;Bilderberg person&amp;amp;quot;. The notion of a Bilderberg person hasn&amp;#039;t changed since the earliest days, back in 1954, when the group was created by Denis Healey, Joseph Retinger, David Rockefeller and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands (a former SS officer while he was a student - ironic that a former Nazi, albeit a low-ranking and half-hearted one, would help give birth to an organisation that so many would consider to be evidence of a Jewish conspiracy).      &amp;amp;quot;First off,&amp;amp;quot; said a steering committee member to me, &amp;amp;quot;the invited guests must sing for their supper. They can&amp;#039;t just sit there like church mice. They are there to speak. I remember when I invited Margaret Thatcher back in &amp;#039;75. She wasn&amp;#039;t worldly. Well, she sat there for the first two days and didn&amp;#039;t say a thing. People started grumbling. A senator came up to me on the Friday night, Senator Mathias of Maryland. He said, &amp;#039;This lady you invited, she hasn&amp;#039;t said a word. You really ought to say something to her.&amp;#039; So I had a quiet word with her at dinner. She was embarrassed. Well, she obviously thought about it overnight, because the next day she suddenly stood up and launched into a three-minute Thatcher special. I can&amp;#039;t remember the topic, but you can imagine. The room was stunned. Here&amp;#039;s something for your conspiracy theorists. As a result of that speech, David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger and the other Americans fell in love with her. They brought her over to America, took her around in limousines, and introduced her to everyone.      &amp;amp;quot;I remember when Clinton came in &amp;#039;91,&amp;amp;quot; he added. &amp;amp;quot;Vernon Jordan invited him along. He used it as a one-stop-shop. He went around glad-handing everyone. Nobody thought they were meeting the next president.&amp;amp;quot; (Of course, Jim Tucker would contend that they all knew they were meeting the next president - for they huddled together that weekend and decided he would be the next president.) At times, I become nostalgic for when I knew nothing. There are so few mysteries left, and here I am, I presume, relegating Bilderberg to the dingy world of the known. The invited guests are not allowed to bring their wives, girlfriends or - on rarer occasions - their husbands or boyfriends. Their security...
