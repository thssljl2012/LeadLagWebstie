 #1 Problem company - Allstate      AIG - Internet broker company basically - what in the hell did you expect?   I can&amp;#039;t understand how people can take chances like that on internet companies.  To each his own I guess....   My financial well-being isn&amp;#039;t something I&amp;#039;d gamble with online.      Anyway - a word of caution Native - if you ever do get in an accident, don&amp;#039;t sign ANYTHING the Progressive adjuster puts in front of you, especially if it concerns medical payments.   They&amp;#039;ve knipped quite a few people recently getting them to sign off on med pay claims almost immediately after the accident.  Then a day later when they can&amp;#039;t get out of bed because of neck and back pain - the insured is S.O.L because they&amp;#039;d already signed off on the med pay.
