 I dont know if this will help (as it isnt life insurance specifically) but when I had to take travel insurance (for 3 years when I went to Australia and again for a year and a half when I went to Switzerland), I took Tata AIG Insurance plans both times, and I must say, they are extremely professional, reliable and have a good network in place. I&amp;#039;m assuming their life insurance plans will be of the same quality..I mean, its Tata        Check &amp;#039;em out!
