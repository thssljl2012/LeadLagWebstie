 It has come to our attention that, as of late October, Ebay will no longer allow its buyers to use USPS Money Orders as an acceptable form of payment, and will sanction their sellers that accept USPS Money Orders.   That is false.    Ebays claim is that USPS m Money Orders (and subsequently the entire Postal Service) are an UNSAFE means to conduct business.   That is false.   Ebay will only be allowing payments through Paypal (which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ebay) or the alternative Propay (which is much costlier than Paypal, so isnt really an alternative).   That is false.   It would appear that Ebays new policy may be in violation of U.S. Anti-Trust laws and perhaps R.I.C.O. statutes (conspiracy to cause financial detriment to the U.S, Postal Service).   LOL @ &amp;quot;conspiracy to cause financial detriment to the U.S. Postal Service.&amp;quot;   It should also be noted that Ebay tried a similar policy change in Australia and it was struck down by the Reserve Bank of Australia. (see link below)   That is false, and... why would you provide a &amp;quot;blog&amp;quot; link... why not provide a link from the Reserve Bank of Australia?   I hope you will give this situation your full consideration and investigation.   The circular file is the proper destination for that speech.
