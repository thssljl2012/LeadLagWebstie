        QUOTE (nikky &amp;amp;#064; Aug 4 2008, 12&amp;amp;#58;24 PM)       how many cards do you have open? How many inquires in the last 6 months/ last year?  Sounds like you are better off without them.    Northing more than the avg CB&amp;#039;er. They&amp;#039;re flaky. When I applied for the card I originally had with them I had a handful of cards, literally. That number has tripled, but they knew that when they approved me of the card I converted to, so its all BS. Truly&amp;amp;#33;
