HELP!            I searched and found some pricing for under $500, but I MUST admit that I couldn&amp;#039;t find that car you mentioned...      Here&amp;#039;s the site I searched:  www.ultimatechoicetravel.com/seetheworld  (click &amp;amp;quot;book travel online&amp;amp;quot; then &amp;amp;quot;car&amp;amp;quot;) This site is a Travelocity.com and AIG travel insurance partner...      hope this helps!
