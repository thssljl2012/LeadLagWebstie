 I keep reading threads that say not to go with AIG for life insurance.  One thing I liked about AIG (have been talking to companies about term life insurance) is that you can use it while alive if you become seriously ill or injured.  Maybe there is a gimmick to this, I have not met with the AIG agent yet to talk about the fine print.  I was just curious why everyone says not to go with AIG.  Who would be some better options to go with for term insurance?  I keep reading how New York Life is good (I am interested in hearing about their family protection term coverage and their 20 ylt) and understand they are good when it comes to whole life.  Are they good for term coverage as well?
