        QUOTE (theshoediva &amp;amp;#064; Aug 4 2008, 12&amp;amp;#58;13 PM)       No need to be sorry&amp;amp;#33; I&amp;#039;m glad it happened now and not after I chose to use it or during a situation where it really would have been unfortunate. They closed with a &amp;amp;#036;0 balance.   I called but they wouldn&amp;#039;t budge. The total number of cards they claimed I&amp;#039;ve opened since the beginning of the year is 14, but I think thats a bit extreme. Its probably more like 10.   At any rate, I have NO intention of EVER applying for another Barclay product again. They&amp;#039;ve lost a customer for life behind this foolishness.    How long did you have the card?
