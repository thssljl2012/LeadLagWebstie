I said i needed a Visa Electron to get cheap flights and he said YES it is an elctron card, funny how its not accepting it as it has 160 in it just now.     Anyone reading this if you want a Visa Electron you can get one from the Post Office though they charge 1.5% to top it up with funds.     I will be calling Barclays soon to complain.     I didnt want a Visa Debit i needed a Visa Electron to save this 16 Ryanair charge                      That&amp;#039;s not nice for you-he should of explained that you were getting a full VISA and not an electron. It is more often that people prefer VISA full over electron so I am wondering if the adviser was confused or whether he did just do it for the sale.
