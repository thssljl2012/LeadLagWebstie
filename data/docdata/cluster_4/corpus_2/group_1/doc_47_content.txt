I&amp;#039;d guess that this is from Barclays, with their business manager package.  It includes either Sage or Quickbooks, plus HR, plus training and other software.  As the monthly fee starts at 1 for their new customers, value mightn&amp;#039;t be an issue!    Danny-b, if it is Barclays, could you ask if you could switch over to Quickbooks.  You could have a look at a trial version first.  Most of my clients find QB more user friendly than Sage
