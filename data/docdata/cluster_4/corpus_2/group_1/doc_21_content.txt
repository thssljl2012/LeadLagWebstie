  hmmm,, I can&amp;#039;t decide which of these 3 cards to apply for...     I want to use it for online purchases for the section 75 protection, and also earn some cashback.. I intend to pay my balance off every month.      What do you think?      Egg Money    Amex Platinum Cash Back    Barclays Cash Back
