 i find it odd that a $6,000 claim warrents a cancelation on their part.  i would dig a bit further and find out why??  also i agree the insurance dept for you state would like to look at this further.  they do take stuff like this serious.  has to be more of a reason to cancel you than a $6,000 claim.  $6,000 is nothing to an insurance carrier...that was a cheap claim!!!  no bodily injury or big hospital bills???  if they raised your rates, ok, but they should not cancel you over this.  if they raised your rates and you said see you later, that is not a cancelation, just for the record!      good luck with it!      BTW: whats global warming got to do with this??  such a public scam anyway!!!
