lots of options-i would suggest checking the pricing on this site the next time you fly: www.ultimatechoicetravel.com/seetheworld... This is a Travelocity.com and AIG travel insurance partner...always worth a look if it can save you money.      Just a note-always clear you cookies inbetween searches on any site to ensure you&amp;amp;#039;re getting the most current pricing.
