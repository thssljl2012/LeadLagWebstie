 Steve Stricker is right at home at Ridgewood Country Club -- and the top of The Barclays leaderboard.     A year after winning across the Hudson at Westchester Country Club, the Wisconsin player shot a 7-under 64 in perfect morning conditions Friday to take a three-stroke lead over Hunter Mahan in the PGA TOUR Playoffs for the FedExCup opener.     &amp;amp;quot;This reminds me of home to tell you the truth,&amp;amp;quot; Stricker said. &amp;amp;quot;This looks like a course that could be very easily in the Midwest somewhere. It reminds me of Medinah a lot. The grasses are the same. We putt on poa annua greens a lot where I&amp;#039;m from. It&amp;#039;s bentgrass fairways, bluegrass rough and everything reminds me of home.&amp;amp;quot;     Source
