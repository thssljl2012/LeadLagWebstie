 TomsMom - I did think of transferring but I actually couldn&amp;#039;t find another ISA that would accept a transfer and pay as high as the Tax Haven.  Much as I&amp;#039;m disgusted with Barclays I&amp;#039;m not going to cut off my nose etc.  Did you manage then to find a better/same as payer, and if so, who was it?  Would love to stick it to Barclays twice, once costing them on the Ombudsman and again by transferring the money out!
