Ok, so he made a few excuses, big deal? Why do people and the media get on his back so much here in America? I know he&amp;#039;s very very popular in the U.S., but obviously even more so in Europe. He was the nicest out of all tour players I saw today. I said &amp;amp;quot;GO GET EM SERGE&amp;#039;&amp;amp;quot; and he acknowledged me with a nice &amp;amp;quot;THANKS BIG GUY!&amp;amp;quot;...As a kid I truly appreciated him at least saying something to me. That&amp;#039;s all I needed. No autograph. No high five. Then a group of kids waited for him to get off the green. He tossed them his ball, and said if anyone wants another meet me on 18 after my round, and slapped them all high fives...this during his real round! I was shocked at how nice he was. I always figured he was a stuck up, ignorant *******, but that is not the case. Do not believe what the media has portrayed him as at all.                        I felt bad for him at the British Open, but still at the same time viewed him as that kind of stuck up guy, your story just completely changed my views on him. I would have been thrilled if he did something like that to me. That is amazing. Great to hear you actually had a PGA Tour Pro Acknowledge you.
