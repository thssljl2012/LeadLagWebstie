My financial well-being isn&amp;#039;t something I&amp;#039;d gamble with online.      Anyway - a word of caution Native - if you ever do get in an accident, don&amp;#039;t sign ANYTHING the Progressive adjuster puts in front of you, especially if it concerns medical payments.   They&amp;#039;ve knipped quite a few people recently getting them to sign off on med pay claims almost immediately after the accident.  Then a day later when they can&amp;#039;t get out of bed because of neck and back pain - the insured is S.O.L because they&amp;#039;d already signed off on the med pay.                      Thanks for the heads-up on the med claims. I spent the morning shopping for auto insurance and did indeed go with Progressive. They had by far the most coverage for the least cost of premiums.       Insurance companies are a bunch of crooks. They love you when YOU pay your premiums on time, but when THEY have to pay for an &amp;amp;quot;incident&amp;amp;quot;, then they can&amp;#039;t leave you fast enough. I live in the second-largest major insurance city in the country, and can&amp;#039;t stand how disreputable the industry is. Nothing but a bunch of white-collar scumbags.
