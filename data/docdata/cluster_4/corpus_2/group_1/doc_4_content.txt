 Barclays did something similar some years ago with Symantec anti-virus. I signed up and got the CD, but it&amp;#039;s not really as great an offer as it sounds. After a year the thing expires and wants you to pay to keep it running. So, what Barclays are really &amp;#039;giving&amp;#039; you is a bill every year!
