After some less than satisfactory service the customer in question changed his password to &amp;#039;Llyods is pants&amp;#039;. At some point after that a member of staff changed the password to &amp;#039;no it&amp;#039;s not&amp;#039;. Requests to change it back to &amp;#039;Llyods is pants&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Barclays is better&amp;#039; or censorship were met with refusal. Personally I found the original change funny, like the customer did. After all, god forbid a sense of humour rears it&amp;#039;s ugly head in business. What isn&amp;#039;t acceptable is the refusal to change it per the customers requests after that.&amp;amp;quot;      Read more of this story  at Slashdot.    &amp;amp;lt;/img&amp;amp;gt;         More...       &amp;amp;nbsp;
