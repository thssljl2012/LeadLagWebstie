 No- your agent will not tell you about the fine print. Assume NOTHING. Even if you think you have coverage for something, you may not.    I thought I had coverage for hit&amp;amp;amp;run, but it turned out that only tood affect if the other driver was CAUGHT! Needless to say, my vocabulary is quite limited here regarding my feelings about that.         &amp;amp;nbsp;               Oh pipe down, you crazy kid!
