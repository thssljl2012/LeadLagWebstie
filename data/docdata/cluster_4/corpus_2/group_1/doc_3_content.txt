 For anyone shopping for auto insurance, just a word of caution to stay clear of AIG. The just dropped my policies after 15 years of premiums because my wife totaled her Jeep Cherokee sliding on the ice this winter and hitting a bridge siderail. Luckily and miraculously nobody was hurt, but AIG canceled our policy when it was up for renewal last month due to the incident.       They got over $20K in premiums and paid out only $6000 to cover the Jeep. Seems like they&amp;#039;re just too greedy to have to pay out anything. That&amp;#039;s why insurance companies suck, and AIG is the worst. Steer clear.
