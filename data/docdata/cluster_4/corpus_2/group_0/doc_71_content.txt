..........rich, maybe I didn&amp;#039;t use the correct wording? I had to pay out of pocket when the garbagemen hit the telephone pole in front of my house and broke it in half. It pulled all the wires out of my house. I had to pay a Liscensed Electric Company to come and repair the problem. Then SF &amp;quot;reimbursed&amp;quot;?, (gave me back) what I had paid minus my deductuion? Is this not the way it&amp;#039;s usually done?
