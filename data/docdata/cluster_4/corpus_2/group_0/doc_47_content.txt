      I&amp;#039;ve had my card since the onlslaught several years ago, never late, over minimum etc.  I don&amp;#039;t schedule monthly payments because I change the amounts according to paychecks.  Yesterday was my due date, I was about an hour away from the deadline and getting ready to pay when we were wracked by a heavy thunderstorm that knocked out the power for about 2 hours.  I paid as soon as I could get back online and today I&amp;#039;m slammed with a 39.00 late fee, but my payment won&amp;#039;t show posting until tonight.  I&amp;#039;ve spoken with three reps and they won&amp;#039;t budge.   They are slipping.  I realize it&amp;#039;s my fault but 3 years of perfect pay and now this.
