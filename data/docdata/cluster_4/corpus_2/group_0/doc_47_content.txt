  Hi All,  I have a foreign mortgage in Euros. In order to save myself some money I&amp;#039;d like to change GBP to Euros locally, put the money into a Euro account and then transfer the funds to the foreign mortgage account.     Initially I enquired with my local bank, Lloyds TSB, and was shocked to find that they charge 7.50 per month for the privielege of holding a Euro account. That is unacceptable to me. Can anyone point me in the direction of a bank that would allow me to open a Euro account without ripping me off with monthly charges?         Regards,  Dave
