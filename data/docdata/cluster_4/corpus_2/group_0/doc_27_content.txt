        QUOTE (1929crash &amp;amp;#064; Jul 7 2008, 02&amp;amp;#58;14 PM)       This kind of passive selling was abolished for goods in 1971. Why not do it for cases like this? It would be a lot more useful than most NuLabour legislation.     Yes the Unsolicited Goods Act 1971. Now whats the betting it doesn&amp;#039;t apply to Financial Services
