I got 17K on mine doing that with a card i never use.      toopoor: What would I do without you?    Piece of cake. What&amp;#039;s funny is that I had &amp;amp;#036;0 cash advance on the &amp;amp;#036;3,500 iTunes Visa. My L.L.Bean went from &amp;amp;#036;15,000/&amp;amp;#036;6,000 to &amp;amp;#036;18,500/&amp;amp;#036;7,400. So I picked up a net &amp;amp;#036;1,400 in cash advances.    THANKS FOR THE SUGGESTION&amp;amp;#33;    Bob      Sucks about the screw over Bob. But now reallocating will save the day - or your report from all those new pesky low limits
