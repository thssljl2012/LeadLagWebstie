 On our Utah ride last July, Paxman and I got stuck in traffic in St. George on I-15. I looked up to see a bank listing the current temp at 114, and the thermometer on my bike was pegged at 120, so it was likely even hotter in that freeway bowl.        We learned a few things about hydration along the way too - the hard way.        I know Paxman (Mark) will be ready, and I will do some testing next week to make sure I can handle it (couple of minor health things going on). Don&amp;#039;t worry, if I can&amp;#039;t pronounce myself 100% fit and ready, I won&amp;#039;t go. No way I want to be responsible for holding anything or anyone up.
