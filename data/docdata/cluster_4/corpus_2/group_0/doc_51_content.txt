      I fear that even talking about them might result in some kind of AA.

Best to BT ASAP.     That&amp;#039;s a good point. I wouldn&amp;#039;t wait around for an RJ. I would be proactive on this one. I can&amp;#039;t imagine Juniper sitting around and doing nothing.   They&amp;#039;ve been a good creditor to me but I have no doubt that they&amp;#039;d bite me in the ass at the drop of a hat.
