In theory I can get view-only access to my accounts without the thing as long as I fill in loads more details. Except their website is shit and after going through stage 1 of 2, 1a of 2, 2 of 2, 1 of 3, 2 of 3 and 3 of 3 (I&amp;#039;m serious  btw  - and frankly I&amp;#039;d like my bank to be able to count to 6) I&amp;#039;m currently just being dumped back at the homepage where I started.     And I&amp;#039;m pissed off about it.     Much as I understand the need for them to be secure, I do feel they could have bothered to implement a service that works, especially as I believe they&amp;#039;ve been rolling this out for a year or so.     So.. what do other banks do? Having been with Barclays for years I have no idea how other banks do their business. Who has efficient and simple online banking? I have no brand loyalty in this area and I&amp;#039;m sick of them.         Ive got one of those with Natwest. Only had to use it once to change the ammount on a standing order. No drama&amp;#039;s.
