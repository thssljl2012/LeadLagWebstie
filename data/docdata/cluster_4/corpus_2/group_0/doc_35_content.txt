 Nothing but a desperate attempt to get men more involved in the sport and to attend the Barclays Wealth British Masters.  Do they really think a few pictures of scantily clad women frolicking around in hay with leather whips will get a man&amp;#039;s attention?  Please!!  Now just how do I get tickets to this showjumping event?
