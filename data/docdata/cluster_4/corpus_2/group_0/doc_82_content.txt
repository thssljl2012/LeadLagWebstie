 Hi Taiwookunade,        I agree with most of your comments but can you be more specific in terms of your work area etc. The guy who had posted this query had worked with well known UK brands (TESCO, Barclays) and has got prior banking experience.        Considering this, there are lot of temp jobs in the finance sector which are dependant on skills - Not need to do any Voluntary work without pay.        Not all agencies are bad. There are seperate posts on them so I don&amp;#039;t want to elaborate here.        Who said non-UK references are not preferred. Again, please be specific in your posts so it is clear for everyone.          For finance jobs (and as for I know in other sectors too) references from other countries ARE accepted. You can&amp;#039;t possibly give UK references when you come from another country.        My last point - You don&amp;#039;t have to start from stratch here. It all depends on your previous experience &amp;amp;amp; how well you sell your CV to the employer.                   taiwookunade wrote:               My advice -     - Register with a professional body as soon as you get here and include this in your CV ASAP.        - Ensure that you most of your job applications are made to employers directly.  Agencies can be very mean in the sense that they discourage you by disqulifying you most of the time without even looking at your CV.        - Try to have one or two UK references handy.  Most employers do not like non-UK referees as they consider this a waste of time contacting them.        Please learn from my mistake and achieve a better result.
