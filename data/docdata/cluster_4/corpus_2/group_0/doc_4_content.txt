 I might have exactly what you need.         Try Clements Insurance at  http://www.clements.com/expatriate/international_auto/overview.asp         That&amp;#039;s an American Insurance company that offers Car Insurance worldwide. They will only insure you if you are a foreigner in the country you are residing. The actual Irish Insurance will be underwritten by AIG in Dublin, from whom you will also get the Insurance Disc. All the other Insurance Documents will from Clements itself.         I am insured with them in the UK, and also was insured with them in Ireland. No problems at all. All my foreign friends are insured with them. So far only one had to make a claim, and there was no Issue at all.        And the best thing is the price. They have fixed prices. I pay the same in the UK then I paid in Ireland. Third Party for a car with a Value of less then 9000 USD (IIRC) is 485 USD a year (300 Euro), which can be paid by CC.         Hope that helps.
