  Very rarely are they worth it.    We used to have  Additions  many many years back, it did offer some benefits we used, but they put the price up and dropped the benefits that were any good to us, so it wasn&amp;#039;t worth it any longer. I didn&amp;#039;t like paying 5 per month for it back in the late 1990s, certainly wouldn&amp;#039;t want to pay what they are asking now!    As for holiday insurance, depends on how many times you go away, whether you always go to the USA, Canada, Australia etc or mostly go within Europe.     http://www.holidayinsuranceweb.com  offers excellent holiday insurance for a family for both single trips and annual insurance. Sister site:  http://www.travelinsuranceweb.com  if it&amp;#039;s for singles, have no kids etc.    You may find others a few pennies cheaper, but they offer less cover.
