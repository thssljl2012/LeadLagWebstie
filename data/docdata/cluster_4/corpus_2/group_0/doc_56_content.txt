I applied for HSMP in may as an outside UK application, although I was phyisically in the UK while I applied because barclays bank where I get my earnings wouldn&amp;#039;t stamp on statements without being in a branch myself. So I applied for a visit visa and came here (with my wife) just to get them stamped and sent my application over.    I thought I would spend some time in the UK as a break until my application gets decided. I was then struck by the huge delay in processing old HSMP applications and it looks like I have to wait for another two months at least which is not possible because I want to start my MSc course in September, so I definitely need to get either Tier1 or student visa before end of September.    So right now I have many issues to worry about&amp;amp;#058;        1. I heard someone saying that an out-of-country application can&amp;#039;t be sent from inside the UK and that when they see royal mail stamps they will reject it, is this really possible?        2. I was too optimistic about my HSMP application to the point I have rented a house for me and my wife to live in with our names. Is this legal given that I&amp;#039;m on a visit visa?        3. Since Tier1 chances to get in time are very slim now I need to go back to my country to apply for a student visa for me and student dependent for the wife. I have an unconditional university offer and have paid the deposit. My problem now is that how much money I need to show to be able to get the Visa for both of us? Do i need to show amount enough for all the university fees and all living expenses? (that would be more than 30,000 since uni fee alone is 15,000 and it&amp;#039;s in London so accomodation is not cheap)        4. Can I attach my lease contract for the student visa purposes (given that I rented the house on a visit visa) or will i be like shooting my foot?        5. If we came back to the UK as student/student dependent then like in a month time I got my HSMP decision with approval, can I switch in-country? can my wife also switch to tier1 dependent in-country?        I know this very complicated but I&amp;#039;d appreciate any help from this wonderful place.
