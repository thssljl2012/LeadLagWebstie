 Yeah I know Beez.. I applied for  my loan in may... I&amp;#039;m fed up of ringing my bank/LSC/SLC to release my funds...        I ring Barclays to find the status and I get put through to some crummy indian call centre... half of them don&amp;#039;t know jack..        Best thing beez is to be after them CONSTANTLY.
