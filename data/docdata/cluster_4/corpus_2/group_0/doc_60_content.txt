We have this morning been to Abbey regarding leaving money from house sale.  Looking at e-saver account, interest rate okay.  However the biggest problem was getting to the money.  We where advised if we had e-saver account we would have to transfer the money into a saving account (Abbey) and then write a cheque out in Oz and present.  Advisor told us that you can&amp;#039;t transfer money via e-savers A/c to Australian bank account???  Cheque would be in pound sterling and would attract fees @ charges.  The cheque could take 6 weeks to clear because of security checks for first  transaction. Advisor also told us that interest rates in UK could drop so this would affect our e-saver interest.  If money wasn&amp;#039;t left in account for 12months would also lose and the best interest rates are only valid for 1 year.  He advised us that it would be better for us to transfer bulk of our money to Australia.  Leaving some here in case exchange rates went up, but who knows when this will be.  We are probably going to take bulk of the money with us and try and get a good rate in Oz.  What are the rates in Oz like at the moment???  As for address we where told we are fine to keep an account in this country.   You can then declare your interest from your UK a/c when doing tax return in Oz.  Hope this helps, just what we have been told from branch in Lancaster.    GOOD LUCK..                        Hi - Many thanks.  No problems with moving the money from the Esaver account as it will be paid to OzForex into their UK account (we&amp;#039;ve done this before we left with absolutely no trouble (large amount) and it has been set up as a payment to their Barclays account).      The interest rates here are around 8.15% as a rough guide.  Best to keep an eye on the exchange rates (as if you aren&amp;#039;t already!) as the news out here today is that the banks are starting to feel the credit crunch and their share values have also been significantly affected.       Once again, many thanks on the Abbey info.  Will get into gear and try and get this and the HRMC sorted out - as well as tax returns here - all good fun!!      Good luck with your move - where are you moving to?
