  Hi, just to let you all know barclays checked cctv, proved i put an envelope in, and have credited me with my 490 plus the 90 they have charged me.  Thanks for your help guys, according to the manager they have 2 people also checking the envelopes so dont understand how it has disapeared!     Shall i contact the police still?? Barclays are not.
