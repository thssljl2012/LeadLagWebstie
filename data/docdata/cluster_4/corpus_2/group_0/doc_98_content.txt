  My 20yr old son has a current account with Barclays. He&amp;#039;s a student and works part time at the local cafe for cash-in-hand wages. He lives at home and in university halls, and has no other means of income. The other day he showed me his Barclays online account page, on which they have &amp;amp;quot;pre-approved&amp;amp;quot; a personal (not student) loan for up to 20k. Fortunately he was only showing me because he was bemused by the whole thing and not because he was interested in taking it. Personally I find it shocking banks can tout these loans to people who clearly wouldn&amp;#039;t be able to repay them. Is this kind of thing strictly legal?
