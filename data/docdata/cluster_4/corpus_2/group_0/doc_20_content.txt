 They may do a straight swap and move into the Barclays on fargate haha.     To be fair on GAP/Barclays here, GAME had the exact same problems with too much floor space, I knew someone who worked there when it was GAME and security was a nightmare. You may have noticed, but the GAP always had a security guard on the door too.    It&amp;#039;s just not fit for a retail unit, it may be a wonderful location for it, but the building isn&amp;#039;t. Ironically, next door is better, but that&amp;#039;s been empty for a good while so I suspect rents are high.
