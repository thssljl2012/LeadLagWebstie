 So my wife backs my car into the trailer on the back of the Land Cruiser and damages both cars.(she hit it so hard it swung around till it stopped on LC)       The Honda is like new and has 1800.00 damage in the right rear corner. The LC is a 98 and not perfect but still looks nice. It has 1300.00 damage to the right rear.      I have insurance with Nationwide and have never had a claim in 11 years. My deductible is 300 per car. Each car is a claim even though they were involved in the same accident (stupid).        So I&amp;#039;m trying to figure out if it will be worth it claiming both. The Honda has to be fixed and I would like the LC fixed but I didnt know if it might be better to just pay for it out of my pocket.                My question is what experiences have you had with accidents and rates??              I hate that I now have a occurrence and am only claiming 1800.00 or two and 3100.00      Thanks, Dan
