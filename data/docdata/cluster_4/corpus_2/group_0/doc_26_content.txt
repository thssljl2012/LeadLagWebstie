Hi, I have looked into this as well and could not find any other banks here that offered that service. I refuse to pay the fees HSBC want. I am wondering about offshore bank accounts, i.e Isle of Man bank which is linked to Natwest, also there is a company who charge $70 (cheaper than HSBC) for opening a bank account for you, they also get you a phone sim card, downside  is that you have to go to an appointment in London when you arrive to meet with the bank and give them your ID. They deal with Barclays, Lloyds and I think HSBC. You can find them on google, I think I typed in &amp;#039;opening uk bank account&amp;#039; or something similar.
