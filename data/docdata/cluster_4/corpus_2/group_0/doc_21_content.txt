 I&amp;#039;m flying next week and bought inexpensive insurance through AIG primarily to cover the expense of ticket replacement or trip interruption -- though the policy has other coverages. Since I won&amp;#039;t pay for my hotel until I check out, I&amp;#039;m not worried about losing on lodging if it&amp;#039;s a shortened stay.       I usually don&amp;#039;t buy trip insurance, but after 8 months of constant fights with an airline for a refund due to canceled service after Hurricane Wilma, I decided to pay the small dollars and let someone else argue for the refunds!
