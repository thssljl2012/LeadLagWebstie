 Ok, I can understand how it all seems a little impossible but not everyone on here are liars. I have much better things to do with my time other than create a load of bull just to please my ego.     About 2 years ago my parents sold there business and retired. They gave each of there children 100K (my money) and I am a SHE, not a HE.     They decided, on their accountants advice to bank with Barclays Wealth. I have been doing some research and found out Barclays Wealth only offer 4&amp;amp;#37; AER on their savings and the return from Stocks &amp;amp;amp; Shares is not as profitable as it would have been if they had put it in one of Martin&amp;#039;s top high interest savings account!  Also, they now generally live in Cyprus although they still have a property in the UK. This means when they purchase or withdraw money using the Barclay cards they are charged a hefty load and APR.     So, my question quite simply was:  Is there any other high interest accounts for such a large amount of money?     You people are so quick to judge? Is it jealousy or the fact that you reallly don&amp;#039;t trust anyone at all! And for your information - I decided to use most of my 100K on a deposit for a house!!
