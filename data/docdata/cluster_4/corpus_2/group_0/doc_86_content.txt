  I have two cases sitting in the Claims Court against two separate banks (Lloyds TSB and the Co-operative Bank) - this further delay on OFT&amp;#039;s part is totally unacceptable!  To say that they need more time is an understatement of the year! They have had (as have we in waiting) 12months - WHY the further delay exactly?
