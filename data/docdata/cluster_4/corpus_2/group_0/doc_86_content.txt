 That really is screwed up. I was thinking I may have to swallow my pride and start a congratulatory thread, then this happens. I seriously doubt it was &amp;amp;quot;payback&amp;amp;quot; by the LPGA, but it does seem a bit odd that they let her play the entire third round before the DQ.     Dale, if there was a rules infraction, she should have been DQ&amp;#039;d. I agree it shouldn&amp;#039;t have taken this long, but it seems the LPGA screws up fairly often, so we shouldn&amp;#039;t be all that surprised.
