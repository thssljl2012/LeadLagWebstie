        QUOTE (jst300z &amp;amp;#064; Jul 16 2008, 01&amp;amp;#58;31 PM)       There are a couple of factors when it comes to insuring rental properties.  First is the number of units.  If more than 4 then it would have to be a commercial policy.  Less than 4 it can be written under a dwelling fire.  Liability could possibly be extended from your homeowner policy, for a minimal fee, or purchaced seperately or offered in the dwelling fire package.  If you have a mortgage on the property, it must be insured, at a minimum, for the loan amount.  If owned outright then you could possibly get a &amp;#039;market value&amp;#039; or &amp;#039;agreed value&amp;#039; policy as opposed to a &amp;#039;replacement cost&amp;#039; policy.  These are much cheaper than the replacement cost policy since the insured value is much less.  But beware, unless you have a replacement cost policy, you will only get a percentage of the insured value.  Example:  You have a building insured for &amp;amp;#036;50,000.  A covered loss has damaged the roof doing &amp;amp;#036;50,000 of damage.  You will not get the full &amp;amp;#036;50,000, only a small percentage.  ****Buy the MOST insurance you can AFFORD****  This is not the area to be a cheap a&amp;amp;#036;&amp;amp;#036;.  A couple of months ago, I had a fire in one of my buildings that was set accidently by a tenant.  I was &amp;#039;insured to value&amp;#039; meaning I insured to replacement cost.  It was a huge loss and I was paid for the actual cash value of the loss.  Needless to say I was very pleased with the outcome and will be building new in the future.    Check with a local independent insurance broker who would have more access to speciality markets that offer products for these properties unlike the big boys (Nationwide, et al.).  Again, don&amp;#039;t be cheap.  Skimp on the carpet in the apartments not on the insurance...      Wow, thanks for the info. The home is paid off so thats good. Nationwide said they will do the homeowners insurance on it as my primary home, since this is the first home I own and I will not be living in it I am renting it. That rate was 1200 a year. It covered everything and included the rebuild cost of almost 200k. I am not paying NO WHERE near that for the home.......  Do you mind telling me who you use? Thanks&amp;amp;#33;
