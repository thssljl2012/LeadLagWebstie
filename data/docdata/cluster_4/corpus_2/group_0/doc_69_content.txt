           most of the larger banks with international branching do... Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Hypovereinsbank etc. You just have to ask there and be persistent, the first person at the front desk might not know or find that too complicated to contemplate... Or you try a branch of City Bank or Barclays right away. I once also learned that American Express is offering USD accounts for their local card holders as additional service.
