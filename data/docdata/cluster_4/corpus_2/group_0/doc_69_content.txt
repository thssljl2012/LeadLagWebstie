I&amp;#039;m a small holder.                                             Barclays and Amp only sold down a very small portion,just enough to keep the price below 40c maybe?      Just speculating,but I can&amp;#039;t explain it any other way.      If they picked up some more on the 4,July well that will answer my question.
