Best to BT ASAP.     That&amp;#039;s a good point. I wouldn&amp;#039;t wait around for an RJ. I would be proactive on this one. I can&amp;#039;t imagine Juniper sitting around and doing nothing.   They&amp;#039;ve been a good creditor to me but I have no doubt that they&amp;#039;d bite me in the ass at the drop of a hat.     if its the first late they may not RJ.  I forgot to set up payment sometime back and I&amp;#039;m still at my normal variable rate (USAir, 15% currently). I PIF as soon as i remembered and was no more than 24 hours late.  No AA as a result and it will never happen again as i have them debiting my bank acct on the due date.  I would recommend anyone who misses a payment like psp or i did to either PIF ASAP or pay well over min then set up autopayments of the min as a security blanket.
