Is it because i stupid stupid stick to one insurance company and never bother to get quotes from others OR the vehicle insurance is getting more expensive?  Thanks.                      I would suggest you get quotes from other company. AIG really not worth it, I called them to say that another company quoted me lower premium and ask if they are willing to match and they reply that they can&amp;#039;t on the spot. So I went with AXA, is cheaper by about $600.
