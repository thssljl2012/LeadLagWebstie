I have been scammed to               I contacted my bank today Lloyds TSB, I paid by visa debit, they won&amp;#039;t do anything for 30 days either.        I&amp;#039;m so cross that I have been sucked into this mess.        I have asked Zavvi several times for a refund but not had one yet.        DO you think I should stop my card?
