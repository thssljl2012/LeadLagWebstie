   If anyone saw this on the news board I don&amp;#039;t think I&amp;#039;d put much stock in it. He claims Willumsted is wrong as he has little insurance experience. Well Shelp was&amp;amp;nbsp; a PR flac at AIG and didn&amp;#039;t know insurance operations. But he is a good observer and writer and his book on Hank was on track with all the stories I heard while there.  Where Shelp misses the obvious point here is that current insurance management is pretty good and that&amp;#039;s not where the problems are. He has the skills in the areas where the problems do seem to lie. So I think he&amp;#039;ll be spending his time on those things. But I do agree he needs a top insurance guy although I don&amp;#039;t see the same urgency there that Shelp seems to. Too bad Brian Duppereault so recently moved from ACE to Marsh. His years at AIG prior to ACE would have made him an excellent choice. Also too bad Jeff Greenberg left. He&amp;#039;d have been as good and probably better. Ah well. We can only wait and hope.
