 as much as love the NBA, and feel that as a city seattle deserves pro sports, the sonics drew some putrid numbers. i feel them though because i am a nets fans and we are averaging around 13,000, and that number may be generous on some nights. im praying that the nets move to the new prudential center in newark, rather than the barclays thing planned in brooklyn
