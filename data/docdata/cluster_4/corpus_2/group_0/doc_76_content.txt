Too funny....I wondered why there were so many peanut shells around ....obviously the monkeys are out tonight.  I would like to know from the &amp;quot;well informed&amp;quot; if they understand Australian Law in regards to fraudulent claims when using direct bank deposits?  And I can from my own experience explain that when Pay Pal make a decision and declare that your money has gone &amp;quot;poof&amp;quot; that is it....no yes we will investigate, just a &amp;quot;decision has been made.  I do hope ebay has a team of Psychologists on standby when their mandatory Pay Pal regime is dismantled, we should not try and reason with manic depressives, we should just keep feeding them peanuts, and it is amusing to watch their demise along the way.  Twice I have had decisions from Pay Pal that has lost me money, yet 35 years with the commonwealth bank I have never lost a cent.  It would seem that I have a much better chance of getting a result from fraudulent scammers who take money from my direct deposit, but absolutely none when it comes to this &amp;quot;floating&amp;quot; off shore company Pay Pal.  Oh how the mighty have fallen since eBay were refused total control with Pay Pal, I suppose we cannot be too suprised from these &amp;quot;Minorities&amp;quot; who waffle on about the true virtue of Pay Pal.
