  Thanks guys, I appreciate it. This Barclays Center, is it being built? Thanks again.   It&amp;#039;s supposed to be. Again there are many lawsuits against Bruce Ratner, the Nets owner, that have hindered the project greatly.     Oh ok I see, thanks alot. Obviously you&amp;#039;re a NJ Nets fan, how do you feel about the move to BK?
