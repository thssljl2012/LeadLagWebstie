When I worked for Barclays, my contract stated that I couldn&amp;#039;t go and work for a competitor for a 6 month period after leaving. Is that not still the case? Can you go from one to another straight away?    I don&amp;#039;t see how they could stop you working for whoever you want! If you terminate your employment by giving the correct notice, your contract comes to an end.  I&amp;#039;ve seen that sort of thing before, but only where company A employs the services of company B, who employs staff themselves - and the companies themselves put contractural agreements in place to prevent the movement of staff from company B to company A, as this would cut out the middle-man. Also common in agency / contractor agreements.  However, in your situation, if they still want to &amp;#039;own&amp;#039; you after your contract has been properly terminated, that means they have to continue the contract for a further 6 months... which means they should be paying you.  This is really what happens with gardening leave... if a company really doesn&amp;#039;t want you to work for a competitor, they will have an extended notice period (as lengthy as they are legally allowed to) and will not expect you to work it, but will simply pay you during this period, and as you are still technically &amp;#039;employed&amp;#039;, you cannot work for the competitor.  It would certainly be illegal to restrict your choice of employer in any other circumstances...
