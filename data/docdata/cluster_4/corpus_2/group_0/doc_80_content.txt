Protect yourself as much as possible, which no doubt you will now.      And unfortunatley unless it was deliberately lit by the tenants, they are entitled to any rent they have paid in advance and the bond in full.      Chock one up to one of the life experiences I guess. Kudos to the Commonwealth Bank for helping out too... I have heard of people that can get some sort of &amp;amp;quot;freeze&amp;amp;quot; on their repayments. I.e. the time it&amp;#039;s frozen for gets added to the term of the loan. Have you discussed that with the bank?      One peice of important advice I will give you.... Document and get receipts where possible for absolutely ANY cost incurred by you to sort any part of this out. Make a log book of time spent, phone calls, any travel to and from Melbourne, etc etc. Absolutely ANYTHING to do with the rental property. All of it will be tax deductable. If the bank don&amp;#039;t want to &amp;amp;quot;freeze&amp;amp;quot; the loan, get the to change it to Interest Only. The repayments are then 100% deductable too.                           Do you think i will be able to claim any cost&amp;#039;s involved even now?
