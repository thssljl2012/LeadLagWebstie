The entire course is wired:  Ball, course, clubs. There&amp;#039;s an electronic grid under the entire course (fairway, rough, OB, water, etc.) that record, every shot, who shot it, how far it went, and where it lands and automatically transfers it to a computer. We get instant, massive statistics for every player on the course.    Version 2 (realistic).  A scoring official is assigned to each player and records each shot in a computer that automatically transfers it to a central computer. One scorer for each player. Not one for each group. That scorer&amp;#039;s observation and recorded score is displayed on an electronic board carried on a sign with the group and instantly transferred to electronic scoreboards on each hole, on TV and on the internet. No pencils, no adding, no players keeping their score or their partners score. Every fan at every hole sees every score in real time.  No delays waiting for the scoreboards to be updated. No scorers at the holes calling into a central HQ.  Also fans all can have hand-held devices to view all the scores. They have these now and they&amp;#039;re very good but not instant.     Version 3.  Keep it the way it is.  Golf, grass, paper, pencils, simple, like it has been played for centuries. If you forget to sign your card, oh well, your loss.
