        QUOTE (Tyra &amp;amp;#064; Jul 7 2008, 05&amp;amp;#58;27 PM)       What were the magic words you used to get them to combine your Sea Miles into your LL Bean?  Is there a special way you need to phrase the request?  In past Juniper threads, others reported having a hard time getting them to combine cards.     i told the CSR that the lady who called me the day before said i could reallocate the CL and she put me through to the credit services/underwriting and i told the guy the same thing - and said i wanted to move the entire SM CL to the bean card and close SM.
