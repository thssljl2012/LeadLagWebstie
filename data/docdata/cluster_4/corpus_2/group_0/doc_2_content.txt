I had to go to a hospital for a few hours in Peru using AIG Travel Guard Travel Insurance. I had to pay upfront.  When I tried to file a claim I found out that since I didn&amp;#039;t get a medical upgrade (I didn&amp;#039;t know there was one) I had to file it through my primary health insurance first and AIG will pay what my insurance doesn&amp;#039;t pay.    I find that it&amp;#039;s a lot of work. I&amp;#039;m going to Thailand and Nepal (3 - 4 day hike to Anapurna) at the end of the year and this unfortunate experience told me I needed to get an insurance for that.     I would like to know if anyone has the experience of using their medical/evacuation insurance and how hard or easy it is to file a claim or even not having to file at all (not having to pay upfront, the insurance pays the hospital directly).  Which company do you recommend and why?    Thank you    Susie
