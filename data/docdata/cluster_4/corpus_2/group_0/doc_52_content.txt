The &amp;amp;quot;customer service specialist with a stoat thru his head&amp;amp;quot; told me that the exchange rate used is the &amp;amp;quot;basic&amp;amp;quot; one with a charge of 1% applied to cover the transaction cost and (after 10pm) the trip to the A&amp;amp;amp;E to treat the knife wound.      It seems that it only works with Barclays if you are a BofA victim.                          And it only works for Barclays Bank in the UK (i.e. not in Ireland or anywhere else outside the UK where Barclays has branches).       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_ATM_Alliance
