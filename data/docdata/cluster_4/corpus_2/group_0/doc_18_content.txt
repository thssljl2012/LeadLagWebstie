        QUOTE (Speedy Gonzalez &amp;amp;#064; Jul 21 2008, 03&amp;amp;#58;06 PM)       Arshavin/Eto&amp;#039;o partnership could be devasting, If you can convince them to join since you&amp;#039;re not in the CL. Gonna be a hard sell by Ramos and co.    Indeed. The fact Eto&amp;#039;o has mentioned us gives me a bit of a boost tbh. If he&amp;#039;s totally ruled us out he wouldn&amp;#039;t even waste his breath, it would just be Chelsea, Inter or Barca. So I do still think there is a small chance, esp as we would prob be willing to pay barca 25-30m for him.  As for Arsharvin it may be the same as Eto&amp;#039;o, the player could almost be forced to Spurs as it were as we are willing to pay with the Keane/Berbatov money.   QUOTE    Zenit St Petersburg have revealed they are in discussions with Tottenham Hotspur about a deal for Russia&amp;#039;s Euro 2008 star Andrei Arshavin but are not prepared to meet the club&amp;#039;s 21.5m asking price for the midfielder.  Arshavin has made clear his intentions to join Barcelona but a move to the Barclays Premier League is also a possibility for the 27-year-old.  &amp;#039;With Tottenham we have contacts,&amp;#039; Sarsaniya told the Russian press.  &amp;#039;This English club is really interested in acquiring Andrei but, as I understand, 27 million (21.5 million) is too high a price for them.  &amp;#039;For Spurs it is unacceptable. Tottenham are ready to pay in the region of 20 million (15.9 million) for Arshavin.&amp;#039;
