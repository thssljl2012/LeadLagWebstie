( I have Amica and love them     )       Here&amp;#039;s something that may make you second guess that decision...     Amica is the best (or 2nd if you can get USAA)    AIG the worst...       http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news0...e_lawyers.html     http://www.jdpower.com/insurance/rat...ovider-ratings       BTW, 786 is still VERY good for a credit score.
