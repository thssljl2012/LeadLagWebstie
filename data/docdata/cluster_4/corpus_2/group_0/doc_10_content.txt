  Hi,    This could just be a paranoid rant, but I thought this the best place to find out..    I got a letter from Barclays Bank yesterday saying that unless I opt out by the 18th July, I am going to be given a &amp;amp;quot;personal reserve.&amp;amp;quot; This will mean they can charge me 22 if I go over my agreed overdraft limit into my reserve, as a &amp;amp;quot;reserve usage fee.&amp;amp;quot; This gives me 5 days to sort things out where I won&amp;#039;t be charged again.    If I go subsequently go over my &amp;amp;quot;personal reserve limit,&amp;amp;quot; or if opt out so that I don&amp;#039;t have one and just go over my overdraft limit, i&amp;#039;ll be charged an 8 &amp;amp;quot;returned/guarenteed transaction fee&amp;amp;quot; per item.    Does this stink a bit of a cheeky way for Barclays to get around this bank charges problem they&amp;#039;re facing? Most people won&amp;#039;t bother to opt out and as such the bank will have permission to bill us 22 for going over our overdraft limit.     Also, i&amp;#039;m a little out of touch with where this bank charges thing is at the moment but might the 8 per transaction fee end up being reduced through the courts? So by getting this out now Barclays are making the 22 for 5 days fee look more attractive than it might end up being?    Off course you are allowed to opt out at any time after the 18th by visiting your bank, but people like me are too lazy/busy at work to do anything other than internet banking...    Cheers.    Al.
