We&amp;#039;ve been having hassle from Lloyds TSB over charges on, which we were assured would be cancelled, but were still taken, and took over 6 weeks to be refunded.  I wrote them a stinking letter asking for some compensation for my numerous phone calls and trips to the branch to sort out their cock-up, on 12 May, and still haven&amp;#039;t had so much as an apology, so we are looking to take our banking elsewhere.  Rather than dragging all the way into town, we have local branches of Natwest and Barclays, so would prefer to use one of these.  Anyone recommend or not?  All advice appreciated.
