      I too got the offer - I don&amp;#039;t think there is anything to worry about.  There are potentially tens of thousands of people taking up the offer.  What does concern me is that, as part of the process, Barclays made us give our unique Online Banking Membership Number to a 3rd party.  In addition, I wonder how many people submitted theirs incorrectly?  I think their was a lack of thought on behalf of Barclays that went into this.
