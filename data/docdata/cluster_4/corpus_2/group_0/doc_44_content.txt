         I have a barclays bank account and a barclays stockbroker account and it still takes 5 days to credit cleared funds to my bank account.  With the faster payments initiative finally seeing the light of day and some transfers between banks actually getting through the same day it makes me very angry that Barclays bank will credit another barclays bank account the same day but not stockbroker transfers............  Is this fair or acceptable...........  Oh and the stockbroker end blames thet bank whilst the bank blames the stockbroking end......  M
