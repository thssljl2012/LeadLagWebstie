....re: trees this is what I was told. If a tree falls and causes property damage, a claim inspector will come and look at the damage. If the tree was &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; (struck by lightening, etc), they will pay. However, if the tree was not healthy (neglected), than that is not anyone&amp;#039;s fault but yours and they will not pay.
