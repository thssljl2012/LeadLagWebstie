This is the way golf has been played for the last 150 years with understood rules on scoring. It is your score card that is the offical scoring document and your responsibility that it is correct. No reason to change. This is just another example of when a player has screwed up. It will just go into the history books and the game will move on.                      Just like all other pro sports - someone else responsible for keeping score.    They already walk with rules officials. Not all pairings, but the top players. I saw this first hand at the Women&amp;#039;s US Open. When an official is not around, they wait for one to be called. Then the official works with the player to get the ruling correct, in effect doing what you say might result in a conflict. They already know how to handle this, and the official has the final say (now and in the future).    Historically there would not have been a good reason. Not required now. I understand you disagree, but just because it is a historical artifact does not make this the best method now.
