 we are thinking about buying a home in France, primarily for holidays (may be to let) then to sell up in UK and move there perminently in 10 to 15 years    what are the steps I should be taking to arrange a mortgage and bank account and does anyone have any recommendations as to which banks to use    also, can I arrange a mortgage here, we&amp;#039;re currently with Barclays, with a UK bank/BS or does it have to be with a French bank/BS    any help would be appreciated    thanks
