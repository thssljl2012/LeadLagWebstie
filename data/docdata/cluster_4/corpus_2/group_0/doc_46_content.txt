  Yes, good idea, I have a list of companies to ring about it - firstly Lloyds TSB who are my bank and they do it so will get a quote from them, but I wonder how long holiday insurance can be for, and whether we may need to renew it if we decide to stay longer but not &amp;amp;quot;become French&amp;amp;quot; immediately. Must remember to check this.      I am in receipt of Long term incapacity benefit so I might be a special case (still investigating this bit), but my partner will definitely need private health care policy when he is there permanently.      Thanks to everyone for help.      Andy
