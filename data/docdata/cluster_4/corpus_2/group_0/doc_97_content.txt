Who&amp;#039;s name is on the sign out front of your shop, you or SF???         &amp;amp;quot;Re-learning&amp;amp;quot; this business is hard, but works. I still get frustrated from time to time when an adjuster uses a scare tactic to influence my customer. Some customers have brains and balls, some do not. That&amp;#039;s life. But if I can influence them correctly, then I have &amp;amp;quot;won&amp;amp;quot; the next &amp;#039;battle&amp;#039;!
