 Thanks to  DBHKer  on flickr for this wonderful shot of the old Commonwealth Bank Building on Victoria St.       Some info on this building from the EPA at  http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/projects/h...=600671&amp;amp;amp;back=1       &amp;amp;quot; The Commonwealth Bank building was constructed in 1880 for the Australian Joint Stock Bank and is the oldest commercial building in Mackay.        It is a good example of its type and demonstrates the principal characteristics of a regional bank of its era, from the reassuring conservatism of the classically influenced design, to the layout, which provided a residence for the bank&amp;#039;s manager on the upper floor.       It was designed by one of Queensland&amp;#039;s most influential architects and has aesthetic value as a prominent and finely detailed building that makes an important contribution to the townscape of Mackay.&amp;amp;quot;      Source:  http://flickr.com/photos/23268776@N03/2653267436/
