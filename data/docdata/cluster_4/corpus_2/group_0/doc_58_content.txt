 All I can say is... So close and yet so far!   Maybe it wasn&amp;#039;t mean to be.    Is there a way they can disqualify those officials for screwing up?  I mean letting her play the whole 3rd round and then telling her she was disqualified after round 2?  Just when I thought this was her tournament!!!
