  damn, only reason we stay with NW is because they helped my dad back when he was in hs and was in a very bad accident. But my dad is a shop foreman for a body shop and deals with the adjuster, says they try and cut corners on fixing stuff, They want to fix something rather than buying it new even though it would take more time and almost the exact amount of money to fix something
