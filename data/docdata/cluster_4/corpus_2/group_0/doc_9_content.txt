Like I said its a discount not a insurance company but they have a good accidental coverage that is on there  and its thru AIG insurance ...I believe it&amp;#039;s worth it... btw  there is this new prenatal vitamin that is out called Expecta by Emfamil they have it at walmart for under $11.00... walgreens has it for under $13.00... its for pregnant and breast feeding mothers... its been out  sense Sept. 2004.... You aught to try it.
