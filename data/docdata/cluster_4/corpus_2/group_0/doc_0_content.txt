        QUOTE(ploppo &amp;amp;#064; 7.07.2008  13&amp;amp;#58;14)       I&amp;#039;m sitting next to another computer which is currently on Kaspersky.com - it is Kaspersky.com where you have to enter in your Online Banking Membership Number.  There is no confusion - the Online Banking Membership Number is with Kaspersky - Kaspersky then email you to say they are going to check the information with Barclays.  This information is clearly moving backwards and forwards between Barclays and Kaspersky.    Think what you like. I suggest you telephone barclays on the number given on their log in page and ask to speak to the head of IT security.
