then why buy insurance if the company can&amp;#039;t pay?    Insurance requires capital.   there is no point if a  trailer park &amp;amp;quot;insuring&amp;amp;quot; itself by having everyone  sign on if the place blows away.   they don&amp;#039;t have  any money.   same thing in the real world.   why  shackle yourself to an enterprise that can&amp;#039;t come  through?   let &amp;#039;em go bust if its that bad.   (which  it  isn&amp;#039;t)
