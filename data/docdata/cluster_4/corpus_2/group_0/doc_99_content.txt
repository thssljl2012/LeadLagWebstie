I got a call from them - almost said &amp;amp;quot;sorry I&amp;#039;m not interested&amp;amp;quot; when they asked for Too Poor as I had 5 junk calls (and i&amp;#039;m on the DNC) - DialAmerica tried to hit me up for MADD and the special olympics within a 15 min period and i thought it was them again. (Yes they are worthy groups but i never respond to phone solicitations.)  Anyway, I am near my max and they could only approve me for 5K. I had to option of reallocating to make it higher, but that is fine as i generally use it for just the shipping and monograms at bean. (I really should combine SM into it and use it for rewards too - or move some of the visa sig into bean since it doesn&amp;#039;t report the limit and bean should.)     Well, DANG&amp;amp;#33; I only have a &amp;amp;#036;3,500 iTunes Visa. I THINK I make more than, let&amp;#039;s see, &amp;amp;#036;3,500 x 4 = &amp;amp;#036;12,000. Yup, I make several times that.
