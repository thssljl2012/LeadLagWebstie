 2 things:   My truck is listed as a &amp;amp;quot;2 door&amp;amp;quot; and the company, Safeco, does not have a 4 door even listed. They consider the 2nd door a partial door. I spoke to the actual underwriter, very long journey to get to them, and they said they would not update the underwritig options even though the rear door on the CM is the same as the front door. Bottom line is they charge more for a 2 door vehicle than a 4 and won&amp;#039;t change it to save anyone any money. I did get them to note my 4 doors on the policy and note that they cofirmed full coverage.      2- I got GAP insurance from Safeco when I got the policy for the Tundra. It was less than $55/year and will cover any value shortfalls in getting a total loss covered. It is always a good idea to have as the truck market fluctuates in value. The insurance companies have a rep for undervaluing everytime a total loss happens. With GAP, they can do whatever they want, you get to be kept whole!
