Hopefully they do, as at the moment we don&amp;amp;#039;t have a game listed as being shown on the opening weekend.    Was pretty pissed last year when Sportsnet couldnt afford to do the 3 games anymore. Got Setanta at home in Toronto but the shite tv provider I have in Montreal (obviously French and useless) doesn&amp;amp;#039;t offer Setanta. Arghhh And these are the things in life that frustrate me....
