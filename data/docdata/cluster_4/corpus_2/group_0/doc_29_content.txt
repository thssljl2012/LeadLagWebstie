      Holy Frijoles&amp;amp;#33;  I just got back from vacation and answered the email &amp;amp;quot;invite.&amp;amp;quot;  Approved - 19K @ 11.74%.  They beat my BofA by 1.5k   Now, question is, will they let me keep it?     ETA:  will update creditpulls when I see who they pulled tomorrow - already did my pulls for the day.
