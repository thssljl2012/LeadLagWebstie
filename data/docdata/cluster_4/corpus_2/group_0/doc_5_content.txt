  Hi,     last year I took out a couple of personal loans from Barclays and nationwide totalling 40K. A poor decision I now know, bu at the time I felt I was in a good IT job, never been made redundant or out of work.      But now things in my industry look shaky, there appears to be a downturn that may leave me unemployed, and I&amp;#039;m worried about my job security for the first time ever.     If I loose my job and can&amp;#039;t meet the loan repayments, what can or will barclays/nationwide do? I&amp;#039;m not a homeowner, I live with my parents.     Must admit I&amp;#039;m getting worried about what will happen. Can I be prosecuted? can debt collectors take my car away or even take items away from my parents house? I have a small savings account with another bank - could that be raided?     Thank you in advance.
