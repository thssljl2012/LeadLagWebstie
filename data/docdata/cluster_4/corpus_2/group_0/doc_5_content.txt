  Being 23 years old on a 6 series tends to get high quotes on my recent purchase of my 6 series I got quoted 2Kish for 6 months for AIG insurance then found out that my father has a friend who is an owner of an insurance agency. Went back and canceled my insurance and picked up my hook-up insurance for 960 for 6 month through GMAC insurance !!! on a 6-series coupe at 23yr old w/ 1 point in record!    What do you pay?
