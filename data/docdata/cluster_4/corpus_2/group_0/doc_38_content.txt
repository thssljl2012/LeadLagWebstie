  Thanks for the suggestions, i ended up getting it done at the Lexus of Pembroke pines body shop, they did an amazing job and i highly recommend them. They have a no re-use policy, so they change everything to brand new, even my headlights! (one was cracked slightly damaged so they changed both to match)
