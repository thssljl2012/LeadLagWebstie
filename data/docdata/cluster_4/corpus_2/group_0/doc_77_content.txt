As a former Nationwide employee who as a product manager worked on rating here in NC, here are the key things that impact your premiums:      * Age of Home (New Construction Discounts are Huge!)  * Fire Class (Proximity to Fire Department)  * Credit Rating (Not necessarily your credit score, even though that is a factor in the models)  * Siding (Masonry, Hardiplank get a discount)  * Deductible choice     I can&amp;#039;t stress enough that on homeowners, you should really have a min deductible of $1,000.  A) You don&amp;#039;t want a claim on your home if you can help it, due to it staying on the CLUE report, which transfers to the next buyer of your home, and homeowner claims are viewed negatively by other carriers.  Its a lot different than auto, you don&amp;#039;t have the pricing power and therefore many companies will just not extend coverage to you period if you have had a prior homeowner claim.
