They beat my BofA by 1.5k   Now, question is, will they let me keep it?     ETA: will update creditpulls when I see who they pulled tomorrow - already did my pulls for the day.    Oh, just kick me when I&amp;#039;m down.    Congrats&amp;amp;#33; Bob      Thanks Bob&amp;amp;#33; I&amp;#039;m sorry they&amp;#039;re stringing you along - hope it really doesn&amp;#039;t take 30 days.  I   LLBean, so I&amp;#039;m really pleased with this outcome. It&amp;#039;s also the first card with tiers for which I received the best terms (such as they are).  Back on the K-bus&amp;amp;#33; This set my Penfed aspirations back a bit... again.     cb_opus: Can we exchange cards?    At least this is 4x the limit of my iTunes, and has a &amp;amp;#036;6,000 cash advance limit.    Bob
