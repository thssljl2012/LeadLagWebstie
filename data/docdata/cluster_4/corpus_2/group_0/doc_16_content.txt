 Guys, you won&amp;#039;t believe this!!!!I was in my lunch break when Barclays calld AGAIN!!! I answered hoping that they would tell me something new...instead, the guy told me that I am late with payments. I told him that I ahve already talked to one of his colleagues the day before and explained the full situation and that my account is fully noted with all my details and all the actions that I have taken until now. His answer was unbelievable!!!He told me that he just phoned me without eve looking at my account to see what is in, what is out and even read the notes!!!!Can you believe that???????????? Amazing!!!!    Oh, and I called that number skillsTrain posted on this forum. A very helpful lady answered and somebody will call me on friday to talk further about my account. I can&amp;#039;t wait to talk to him/her.   fingers crossed, maybe this nightmare will end!!I can&amp;#039;t take it anymore!! I alredy have very bad stomac problems, I can&amp;#039;t sleep in the night and I feel I am at the edge!!
