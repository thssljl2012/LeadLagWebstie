Eh 4.8k insurance expensive boh ? AIG - 28 yr old - First Car purchase.             Cannot be so expensive leh...                 My insurance only 1.8K for my CL7A leh. 5 years driving experience, 2nd car, zero NCD due to one claim last year (Chong Dong), 1500 excess, cover all any drivers and standard risk coverage package.        Sorry i still quite confuse on how insurance companies quote. Maybe the one you buy is too good one.   _________________ Regards        Ken         http://www.solsticedream.blogspot.com/
