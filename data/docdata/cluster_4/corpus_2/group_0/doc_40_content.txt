 I have Nationwide insurance Ohio and currently covered for DE only. would purchase track coverage but the track coverage is pro-rata meaning that if other insurance applies it only covers its share of the loss since I cannot isolate the track coverage as the only coverage to apply for track I am going along. If I had a medium loss I would pay out of pocket if I had a total loss I would turn it in. By the way I had Century insurance willing to write DE coverage on a per event basis but  I could not get PCA national to release any data about the extent of incidents compared to participants. so It in not a priority yet but will be some day.
