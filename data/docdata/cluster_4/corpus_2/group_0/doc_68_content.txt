If the scores are not recorded by anyone other than the player like you say, then how do they even know if an incorrect score is signed for?        An official would have no idea the player made a mistake if they weren&amp;#039;t keeping score also.                         Even on the tours, players exchange cards and mark each others scores.        Officials don&amp;#039;t keep track of individual scores.  The &amp;#039;scorer&amp;#039; that follows a group only asks what score was made and relays it back; they don&amp;#039;t have any authority over what score is recorded.      And that&amp;#039;s why a player&amp;#039;s signature on a scorecard is so vital.  Only he knows, and only he can be responsible for any mistake.
