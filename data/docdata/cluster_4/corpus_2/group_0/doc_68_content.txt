      My Barclays card just cut and like I mention in previous posts, I am currently out of work. The balance on the card is 150 and my minimum payment due is 5 bucks. I&amp;#039;ve read that it is not adviseable to only pay the minimum. If I toss them a 20 spot, should that be fine or should I try to scrap together more money to make a bigger payment?
