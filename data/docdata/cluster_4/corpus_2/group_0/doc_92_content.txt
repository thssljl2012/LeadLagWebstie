        QUOTE    I see how it works.  HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Lloyds TSB and HBOS support B&amp;amp;amp;B for their issue.  then B&amp;amp;amp;B and the others can support HBOS with theirs,  then HBOS and B&amp;amp;amp;B can support Barclays...  Yes, it makes complete sense.   Unless it is circular, oh dear, it is&amp;amp;#33; Whoops&amp;amp;#33;      I once saw a diagram in a boy scout manual showing how a large group could sit comfortably even if no chairs were available. The group formed a circle and all assumed a seated posture sitting in the lap of the person behind them, with the person in front sitting in their lap- thus a circle of comfortably seated people was created.  My thought at the time was that it might work- but if one fell over he would take all the others with him.
