 I think that some of golf&amp;#039;s rules and etiquette are a joke. But the rules are the rules. If you agree to play, you need to follow the rules.      But how screwed up is a sport that will let a player play an entire extra round thinking she has moved into solid contention for a championship and then tell her &amp;amp;quot;Oh by the way, Michelle, uh, you were disqualified after   YESTERDAY&amp;#039;S FREAKING ROUND   !!!!&amp;amp;quot;      How long does it take officials to review 150 scorecards to make sure they are all signed?
