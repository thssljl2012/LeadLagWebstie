                                      AS the LDA is a functional part of the GLA I could imagine they had been holding out/been slow/ due to do so anyway.      I dont know what/if any  percentage of the GLA was not paying the London Living Wage.   There was already a commitment to make the whole of the GLA pay the Wage.
