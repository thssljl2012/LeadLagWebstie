 I have just come back from the shops - and this outage is causing major problems!!     St George bank have closed up shop as they use Optus!! A majority of the eftpos machines are out - as they also use the same lines!! The mobile shops - except Telstra - have a queue with quite a few angry people in them!!!      This same thing happened about 6 years ago to Telstra - a major cable got cut in Ballina and wiped out the S.E coast!! Now - that was a busy day!! and there were lots of service guarentees handed out!!      DH is calmer now that there is an actual physical reason!! I was just not impressed to get an angry phone call - with him asking me &amp;#039;What have you done??&amp;#039;        I must be a miracle worker - I am 28kms away from him - but its my fault!!        Gotta love boys and there not so technically savvy brains!!!          And Ally - no offence taken!! I worked for T, and that was always the first question I would ask customers if there was something wrong with their phones!! If you don&amp;#039;t pay - don&amp;#039;t expect usage!!!         S
