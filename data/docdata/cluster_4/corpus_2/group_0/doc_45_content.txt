 Thanks again for the reply latecomer. I rang them and they said it wouldn&amp;#039;t affect my credit rating. Not sure if I believe them as they answered far too quickly, if you know what I mean! Would it be Barclays themselves who can un-do the bad rating?    Anyway the plot thickens. Yet ANOTHER text from Barclays, this time threatening the debt collectors! I phone them up again, confirm my account is cancelled with a balance of 0, and they apologise telling me to ignore the message. It&amp;#039;s quite hard to ignore a message like that...    The only way I&amp;#039;ll know for sure is to get the credit report I suppose. I&amp;#039;m currently applying for the Amex Cashback Card so I&amp;#039;ll be peeved if there is anything untoward on it.    Thanks again for your help,    Chris
