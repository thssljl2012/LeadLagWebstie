I believe one of the analysts claimed that Greg Norman made history today, being the oldest leader going into the final round of a major tourney.      Another analyst quipped that Norman was only using this tournament to practice for next week&amp;#039;s Senior British Open.      Incidentally, I watched the simulcast of both Thursday&amp;#039;s and Friday&amp;#039;s Open via the PGA Tour.com site. The simulcasts lasted until TNT&amp;#039;s cable coverage began.      During the U.S. Women&amp;#039;s Open, I also watched the Marquee Group coverage as much as possible, and enjoyed that, too.      I look for these since I only have basic cable and don&amp;#039;t get ESPN.      This is something I wish the LPGA would consider in their current media negotiations, at least for the major tournaments.
