Suggest you register with Experion or another credit rating agency and also CIFAS who help protect your ID.        My experience last week - debit card/driving licence nicked - gets worse. Used driving licence to open store cards, buy mobile &amp;#039;phones etc - growing list of letters day by day. Barclays fraud have been great but it&amp;#039;s a real worry now.
