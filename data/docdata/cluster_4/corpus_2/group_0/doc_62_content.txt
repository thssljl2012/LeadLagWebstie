I&amp;#039;ve been out of the UK for eight years. I have maintained my UK bank accounts and still do UK tax returns. Barclays are quite happy with the situation (my statements come to Canada). The UK taxman is quite happy too. The bank knocks tax off the interest I make. The UK taxman gives it back to me because I&amp;#039;m not resident and then I give it to the Canadian taxman. I could probably simplify the process by not claiming the UK tax back and then using that as a credit on my Canadian tax return.
