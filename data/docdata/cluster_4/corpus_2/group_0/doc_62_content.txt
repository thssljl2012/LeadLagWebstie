I THINK I make more than, let&amp;#039;s see, &amp;amp;#036;3,500 x 4 = &amp;amp;#036;12,000. Yup, I make several times that.    Bob     Besides the fact that 3.5K is quite high for itunes - it&amp;#039;s not a minimum (or a starting point), its a max.   I&amp;#039;m sure there is more to the max than just straight income too - like current balances and internal history.   itunes seems to be their low end product- I think someone said they were told the max on it was like 5K (but i could be mistaken).     &amp;amp;#036;14,000. I actually CAN multiply.    Anyway, I looked in the database, and there are quite a few &amp;amp;#036;240 and &amp;amp;#036;250 limits. At least one &amp;amp;#036;5,000. I guess maybe I won&amp;#039;t cancel this card, I was quite insulted when I first received it.    I need to get some summer Polos, so I&amp;#039;ll give them 10 days to solicit me, before I go for it cold. Thanks for clarifying matters, toopoor. Bob     in our house there are 3 juniper cards, limits 40K, 36K, and 31K.     OK, I&amp;#039;m ASKING for &amp;amp;#036;100k&amp;amp;#33;    Bob P.S. Because it worked SO well with Alliant.
