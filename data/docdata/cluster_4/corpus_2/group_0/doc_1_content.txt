 I have just discovered there is a facebook group called &amp;#039;SkillsTrain Unsatisfied&amp;#039; and on it i found this very interesting piece of information.      &amp;#039;on the 6th may skillstrain sister company train4trade skills was rumbled by the association of plumbers as being a rogue company. PLEASE TYPE THIS IN GOOGLE AND SEE FOR YOURSELVES RIP OFF ROGUE TRAINING PROVIDER TARGETS THOUSANDS OF CONSUMERS&amp;#039;      Things are hotting up       I&amp;#039;m still counting down the days until i hear from either SkillsTrain or Barclays.      P.S. skillstrain have posted a response on a couple of other boards, just your usual standard automated message, you can read them here  http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/forums/in...orumid=2&amp;amp;amp;sr=41  and here  http://www.consumeractiongroup.co.uk...ml#post1606431
