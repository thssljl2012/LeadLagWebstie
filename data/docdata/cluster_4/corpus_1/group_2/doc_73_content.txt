Newcastle have chosen Joe Kinnear as their interim manager, until the end of October.The former Wimbledon, Luton and Nottingham Forest boss has the job with the troubled Barclays Premier League team on a short-term basis.The Magpies turned to the 61-year-old after former England boss Terry Venables turned down the job on Thursday, following Kevin Keegan's departure earlier this month.Kinnear said: 'I am very excited about the challenge in front of me at Newcastle United.'Results have not been great of late, but there is a lot of quality in the squad and I am very confident the players are capable of climbing the league table.'Newcastle United is a great club. When I was in charge of Wimbledon, I always remember the passion of the fans up there and how great a stadium St James' Park is.'It is a big challenge, but one I am really looking forward to.'
