Chelsea's hope of having John Terry available for their match against Manchester United this weekend look doomed despite their submitting a claim for wrongful dismissal following his straight red card against Manchester City.The England and Chelsea skipper was sent off after he brought down Brazilian striker Jo in their Barclays Premier League clash at Eastlands on Saturday.Chelsea's argument is that Terry did not deserve a red card because Jo was a long way from goal and Ricard Carvalho was in close attendance and would have made a tackle.  However, referee Mark Halsey 's report said the sending off was for serious foul play rather than for a professional foul, rendering any complaints that Terry was not the last defender null and void. More...    Serious foul play is classed as when a player 'uses excessive force or brutality against an opponent when challenging for the ball when it is play.'The official FIFA rules continue: 'Any player who lunges at an opponent in challenging for the ball from the front, from the side or from behind using one or both legs, with excessive force and endangering the safety of an opponent is guilty of serious foul play.' Straight red cards cannot be downgraded to a yellow, so Chelsea will have to successfully argue that Terry did not deserve a yellow in order to succeed in the appeal which is highly unlikely.
