 Manchester United are winning the battle to sign Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham.On a crazy day in the north-west, the Bulgarian finally met Sir Alex Ferguson at United's Carrington training complex before heading to Old Trafford for what many people see as the final act in one of the summer's most lengthy transfer sagas.And news that Berbatov was having a medical with United in Manchester only further fuelled the belief that United were about to get their man.It has been repeated throughout the day that a fee has still to be agreed between United and Tottenham, and publicly at least Spurs have not even given Berbatov permission to speak with the Old Trafford outfit.However, it is hard to see how such manoeuvrings can be done without the selling club's consent although nothing can be ruled out - especially with Manchester City so keen to hijack the deal.It would now appear unlikely Ferguson would fail in a quest that has taken him months to reach this stage.As well as bidding for Berbatov, City's prospective new owner has revealed the club have lodged bids for Valencia striker David Villa and Stuttgart forward Mario Gomez.Dr Sulaiman Al-Fahim, who is heading the Abu Dhabi United Group's takeover of the Barclays Premier League club, told PA Sport that he is 'hopeful' a deal for Tottenham's Berbatov can be agreed before midnight after a fee of more than 30million was agreed. And he said: 'We have bids in for three players. There is Berbatov, but there is also David Villa and Mario Gomez. We have bids in for Villa and Gomez and I am waiting to hear whether we have been successful with those (offers).' 'Funds are available, and transfers such as these show we are serious,' he added.
