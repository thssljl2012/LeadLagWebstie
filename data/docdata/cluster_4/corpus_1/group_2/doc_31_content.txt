Hull boss Phil Brown admitted Tim Cahill's controversial goal was the turning point in their 2-2 draw with Everton on Sunday.Barclays Premier League newcomers Hull had led 2-0 when Cahill sparked a comeback with a 73rd-minute strike that was ruled to have bounced over the line off the bar. 'It gave them the impetus to get something out of the game,' Brown said. The Tigers boss was convinced referee Lee Mason and his assistant had made a mistake and his anguish was compounded by Leon Osman's 78th-minute equaliser. He added: 'The referee gave it so it had to be over the line didn't it? But if you look at the evidence it is very inconclusive. 'The referee is guided by his assistant referee and unfortunately for us he deemed the ball over the line, but how he can tell from that... If you have a look on the TV you will find it wasn't a goal.' Opposite number David Moyes felt the result was no more than his side deserved, although he was far from pleased with the Toffees' defending.Everton have now scored own goals in three consecutive games and Moyes had chosen to start with England international Joleon Lescott on the bench after an indifferent showing in midweek. 'I didn't think we deserved to be 2-0 down,' Moyes said. 'In the end the players got back into the game and I think we were probably a bit disappointed we didn't take all the points.On the Hull goals, Moyes added: 'It was two set-pieces, the first one we got outjumped on, the second was just poor communication and bad defending.'
