Tottenham boss Juande Ramos' problems continued after his side were held to a 0-0 draw against Wigan which saw them remain at the bottom of the Barclays Premier League table. Spurs' lack of quality firepower since the departure of Dimitar Berbatov and Robbie Keane was even further apparent as they struggled to break down Steve Bruce's side and they are still searching for their first league victory after five matches. Worryingly for Ramos, his side also look short of form and the Spaniard withdrew multi-million pound summer signings Roman Pavlyuchenko and David Bentley. In a game of poor quality, Spurs were convinced they should have had a 64th-minute penalty when Aaron Lennon, Bentley's replacement, appeared to be tripped by Wigan defender Maynor Figueroa. But referee Steve Tanner infuriated the home fans and sent the Tottenham bench into near apoplexy by ignoring their appeals. The frustration drove Spurs on and Jamie O'Hara, Darren Bent and Gareth Bale all rained shots on the visitors goal in the closing stages but Wigan held out. It was a frantic finish but did not stop home fans booing their team off at the full-time whistle as they had done at the break. Egypt international Amr Zaki was often left as a lone striker as Emile Heskey dropped deep but he showed danger when shooting wide on the turn in the 37th minute. It was hardly a surprise when Pavlyuchenko did not come out for the second half, Fraizer Campbell replacing him after he had suffered a series of heavy challenges. He did not look injured but failed to even sit on the bench in the second half as Spurs laboured in vain.
