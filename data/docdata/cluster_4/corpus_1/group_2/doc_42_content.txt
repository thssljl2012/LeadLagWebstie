REDCAR'S Terry Bywater produced the performance of his life as Britain overcame the odds to land Paralympic wheelchair basketball bronze against the USA.Bywater, 25, stole the show as he top scored with 32 points during Great Britain's 85-77 win in Beijing.Immediately following the team's success, Terry dedicated the win to head coach Murray Treseder.The no-nonsense Aussie was forced to return to his homeland last week during the group stages after a long-standing medical condition flared up in the Far East.Britain never looked like capitulating in the final, despite Treseder's absence, as Bywater hit a basket on the buzzer at the end of the third period as Britain outscored the Americans 24-11 to open up a telling 14-point advantage.And despite a brief US comeback in the final quarter, Britain held their nerves and ran out comfortable winners.Terry said: 'This tournament has been up and down for me.'I've probably had two good games before tonight. I thought I had to come here and prove a point.'I felt it was my time, and I got to do it in a medal game which is fantastic.'Several of the guys are in their first Paralympics, and we used them to play some very important roles, especially in the first game against the USA.'This means a lot more to me than Athens. We knew it would be tough and we knew we had 'the group of death'.'Then came the game against the USA to win bronze and we took it off them - that is why it means so much.'I remember my first Paralympics in Australia. I was scared and frightened and it was all a big blur to me. But these guys have come in and been big players for us. You have to take your hat off to them.'Treseder, who returned to his home in Australia on medical grounds during the competition, immediately phoned stand-in coach Sinclair Thomas to offer his congratulations to the players.Thomas said: 'I said to Murray that it was all down to him. But everybody has played their part and it's a terrific all-round achievement. I can't believe we've done it.'LLOYDS TSB, proud first partner of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and supporter of ParalympicsGB on their journey to 2012.
