Arsene Wenger is concerned with the diminishing role of managers following the influx of foreign owners into the Barclays Premier League - but maintained he would never work under such conditions at Arsenal.Both Kevin Keegan at Newcastle and former West Ham boss Alan Curbishley cited a perceived lack of hands-on control over transfers as reason behind their decisions to walk out.'I am scared they (managers) are not becoming more like on the continent, but even less,' said the Frenchman. 'On the continent at least you are informed on what kind of players you buy. It looks like some are not even informed any more.'It is a situation being faced by more top-flight managers, as overseas investment comes at a price in terms of just which players are coming in or will be leaving.Manchester City's new owners splashed out a cool 32million to snatch Brazil international Robinho from under the noses of Chelsea - although that move was more than welcomed by Eastlands boss Mark Hughes.However, such cultures of a manager becoming little more than a coach hired to look after the players they are given is something Wenger - who currently operates without a director of football - feels could prove detrimental to the game in the long-term.He continued: 'It looks to me to be going a very worrying way.'We face responsibilities and we stand up for it - but at least you want to feel you are responsible for the decisions you are judged on.'Wenger maintained: 'I feel I am in charge on the technical front of course - but that is the definition of my job.'Yet there is a type of ownership which changes and it is provoking a different kind of management and a different kind of responsibilities. People who come from another country, they import the way people manage in their country - in England you had a tradition that was never questioned.'Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
