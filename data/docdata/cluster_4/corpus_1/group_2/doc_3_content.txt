Chelsea hope to have John Terry available for their match against Manchester United after they submitted a claim for wrongful dismissal following his straight red card against Manchester City.The England and Chelsea skipper was sent off after he brought down Brazilian striker Jo in their Barclays Premier League clash at Eastlands on Saturday.A mistake by Deco in the 77th minute had allowed Jo a run at the Blues' defence and as the City forward went past the 27-year-old defender he put out an arm to impede the run.Terry was guilty of a cynical foul but Jo still had a long way to go to goal and Ricardo Carvalho was in close attendance which made it a debatable call by referee Mark Halsey.The Football Association confirmed on www.thefa.com that Chelsea had submitted a claim for wrongful dismissal and an FA regulatory commission will consider the claim on September 16.Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
