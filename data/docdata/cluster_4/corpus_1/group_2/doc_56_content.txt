'It has been a long fight, but it has been worth it. If we had not had our story in your newspaper, then this would not have happened'Martin Denholm17 September 2008A NINE-MONTH battle to have their son's DNA removed from the national police database has been won by Worthing couple Martin and Lorraine Denholm.Their 16-year-old son Grant was arrested during a town centre fraud enquiry on New Year's Eve, and he was then released after eight hours in custody.But police refused to destroy his DNA sample, even though they considered there was insufficient evidence to hold Grant, who is now aged 17.Mr and Mrs Denholm, of Henty Road, were so desperate they got in touch with Liberty, also known as the National Council for Civil Liberties, which decided to take on the case.DNA destroyedLast week, Liberty informed the Denholms the police had agreed to remove Grant's DNA from their database and destroy his fingerprints and photograph.'I am delighted about this, of course, although there is no reason for them to have kept these details in the first place,' Mr Denholm told the Herald.'I have had no letter of apology from the police, which really annoys me,' he said.'It has been a long fight, but it has been worth it.'If we had not had our story in your newspaper, then this would not have happened. But I am still going to write to the police seeking an apology.'What happenedThe incident happened late-morning, after Grant was taken by his father to pay in money at Barclays Bank.Mr Denholm gave Grant the cash to pay in, and when he did not return to the car in a reasonable time, he went to the front of T.K. Maxx and saw Grant handcuffed and being taken to a police car.Grant had been standing in a queue outside the bank when a youth asked him to exchange a 50 note for two 20 notes and one 10 note.Police arrested Grant when the money was being exchanged, and Grant was detained in connection with a store-fraud enquiry which the police were conducting at the time.Grant said afterwards that it had been a mistake to sign a T.K. Maxx document, written out by a store representative, which banned Grant from entering any T. K. Maxx store in the UK.'I wouldn't have put my signature on that banning order if I had known exactly what I was signing,' said Grant after he was released.
