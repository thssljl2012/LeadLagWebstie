FA clarify situation over Kinnear touchline banThe Football Association have moved to clarify the situation over interim Newcastle boss Joe Kinnear's touchline ban.EmpicsKinnear was forced to watch his first game from the stands.It emerged in the wake of Kinnear's surprise appointment on Friday that he still has a suspension to serve from his time at Nottingham Forest.Yesterday's 2-1 home defeat by Blackburn counted as the first and the 61-year-old will complete his punishment with next Sunday's Barclays Premier League trip to Everton.An FA spokesman said: ''It is a two-match suspension which is carried over from when he left his position at Nottingham Forest to when he started any further employment, in this case at Newcastle United.''Yesterday counted as the first one and Newcastle's next game at Everton will be the second of the two.''Kinnear incurred the ban for comments made to the referee after Forest's clash with Gillingham in November 2004, when he described the official as 'Coco the clown'.The punishment was not handed down until January 2005, by which time the former Wimbledon boss had resigned from his post.Magpies owner Mike Ashley has appointed Kinnear as manager until the end of October, by which time he hopes to have sold the club.
