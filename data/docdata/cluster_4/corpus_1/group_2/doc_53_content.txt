Frank McGarahan, 45, chief operating officer of Barclays Wealth, attempted to break up a brawl in Norwich city centre at 3am on Sunday. Norfolk Police said Mr McGarahan, of Hertfordshire, had enjoyed a 'quiet evening out' before the attack as he visited the city to attend a family christening. He died on Monday at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, after suffering head injuries. 'Mr McGarahan was spending a quiet evening out with family and friends ahead of a family christening in Norwich on Sunday when he witnessed an assault while queuing for a taxi on Guildhall Hill, after which he sustained a fatal injury,' said a Norfolk Police spokesman. 'The investigation into the incident continues and officers are reviewing closed circuit television footage from around the city centre area and following up a number of lines of inquiry.' A Barclays spokeswoman confirmed that Mr McGarahan was chief operating officer of Barclays Wealth, which employs 7,700 staff in 20 countries and manages assets worth 133bn. Police said post-mortem tests will be carried out on Tuesday. Detective Superintendent Chris Hobley said: 'Norwich City Centre is generally a safe place and there were a number of people in the vicinity of the incident. 'We are very keen to hear from anyone who may have seen something or has any information.' Police are investigating the murder of a top banking executive who died after he intervened in a street fight in Norwich.
