Luiz Felipe Scolari believes team ethic is separating Chelsea from the rest with confidence in the camp growing by the week.The Brazilian coach now wants his players to build on Saturday's 2-0 victory at Stoke in the Barclays Premier League when they face CFR 1907 Cluj on Wednesday in the Champions League. He said: 'My team is in good condition and we are keeping our shape well. We are now at our best. All my players know their position and how to cover for each other if necessary. If a player makes a mistake, another one helps him out and that is important.' He added: 'We have won most of our matches and drawn only two. We have confidence as we have good players.' However, Chelsea suffered another injury blow at the Britannia Stadium when Salomon Kalou did not appear for the second half after taking a knock on his ankle.The striker's fitness will be monitored ahead of the Champions League match as will Joe Cole's. He was sidelined because of a slight tear in his thigh.Deco (thigh), Ricardo Carvalho (knee) and Michael Essien (knee) will all miss the match because of injury.
