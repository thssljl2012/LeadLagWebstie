COURT ACTION: Wheelchair actionTeam rally together to win medal for their sick coach.WHEELCHAIR basketball ace Adillah Jama played an instrumental role as Britain overcame the odds to land Paralympic wheelchair basketball bronze against USA.The 25-year-old Liverpudlian  who was competing at his first Paralympics  scored seven points during Great Britains 85-77 win over the Americans and immediately dedicated the win to head coach Murray Treseder.Treseder, no-nonsense Aussie, was forced to return to his homeland during the group stages after a long-standing medical condition flared up in the Far East.Britain never looked like capitulating in the final, despite Treseders absence, as Terry Bywater  who top scored with 32 points  hit a basket on the buzzer at the end of the third period as GB outscored America 24-11 to open up a 14-point advantage.And despite a brief US comeback in the final quarter, Britain ran out comfortable winners.'I'm so proud of all the players, said Jama  who plays club basketball for the Wolverhampton Rhinos.It has been a hectic week with all the turmoil, but we've shown grit and determination to win bronze.Its simply electric. It doesnt quite hit until the medal is around your neck. It feels good for the team and for the effort they put in through these last two weeks.In 2006 we fell out of the worlds top four. When we get into the gym and break sweat, blister and bleed, we want to get on the medal podium, hear national anthems, and be part of the best. Thats what got us through and won us this medal.Jama was joined in the Far East fellow Paralympic new-boy Ade Orogbemi  who netted two points in 12 vital minutes in Chinas National Indoor Stadium.The 30-year-old narrowly missed out on selection four years ago in Athens and was quick to reveal that the British squad of 12 would never all appear on the same court again, with the likes of veteran Andy Blake calling it a day after Beijing.Youll never see this group of 12 again, said Orogbemi  who also plies his trade at Wolverhampton.Obviously Andy is retiring and that emotion pulled us through.We came in to the game knowing that the USA was unlucky against Canada in their semi-final and in our eyes they could have won this tournament.They were the best team, and will be the best team in the future. We needed to try to get their level and keep close, which we did.Treseder, who returned to his home in Australia on medical grounds during the competition, immediately phoned stand-in coach Sinclair Thomas to offer his congratulations.Thomas said: 'I said to Murray that it was all down to him. I can't believe we've done it. Lloyds TSB, proud first partner of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and supporter of ParalympicsGB on their journey to 2012.
