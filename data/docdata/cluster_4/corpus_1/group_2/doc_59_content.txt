PARALYMPICS: SHEFFIELD'S Jill Fox insists Great Britain's wheelchair basketball team can leave Beijing with their heads held high, despite failing to meet their pre-Games target. UK Sport representatives and head coach Garry Peel had both said sixth was the realistic goal after eighth place in Athens.But Fox and Sheffield star Joanne Harper had to settle for eighth again yesterday after being thoroughly outplayed by China, losing 57-38 in the seventh-place play-off. Fox said UK Sport were happy with the girls' performance after they were drawn in a tough group with defending champions USA, 2004 silver medalists Australia, World Championship bronze medalists Germany and Brazil.'I don't know what happened in that game, we were just outplayed. They hit everything and we missed everything.'That is the only game that has happened to us in and that has been noted. UK Sport have apparently said they are pleased with the performances so it can't have been that bad.'Sometimes it is not always about results but performances and improving. We have worked so hard and the team have done a fantastic job, we have put everything in and can have no complaints.'GB's only victory wassagainst Brazil, which put them in to the knockout stages, but defeats against Japan and the Netherlands left their hopes in tatters.Fox, 38, took to the court for three minutes against China, while Harper was again an unused substitute in her Paralympic Games debut. She would not speculate whether she would be in the next Games.n Lloyds TSB, proud first partner of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and supporter of ParalympicsGB on their journey to 2012.
