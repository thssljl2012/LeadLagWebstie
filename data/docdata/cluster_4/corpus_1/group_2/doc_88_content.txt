Gianfranco Zola watched on as Chris Brunt struck a late winner to give West Brom a 3-2 victory over West Ham at The Hawthorns.Zola had seen his new side recover from conceding an early goal to James Morrison to lead 2-1 thanks to goals from Mark Noble and captain Lucas Neill.But a penalty from Roman Bednar levelled matters for the home side before Brunt settled the issue seven minutes from time to give Albion their first win of the Barclays Premier League campaign.Morrison put the Baggies ahead after only two minutes, however there appeared little danger when a left-footed cross from Brunt went across the Hammers box.Borja Valero was first to react to the loose ball though, and he had time to pick out the run of Morrison, who sent a glancing header wide of Robert Green into the net - Albion's first goal in open play since returning to the top flight.The visitors levelled after 28 minutes when Valon Behrami's header was parried by Carson straight to Mark Noble, who netted from close range.West Ham went ahead when Noble's centre was headed back across goal by Calum Davenport and Lucas Neill volleyed home from close range.But within 60 seconds West Brom were level after Green brought down Barnett and Roman Bednar drilled the penalty powerfully into the net.Albion knocked the ball around confidently at the start of the second half and a fine move ended with Paul Robinson finding Bednar in space - but Green parried.The decisive goal came in the 83rd minute when Brunt scored after taking a pass from Robinson. Scott Parker should have equalised in injury-time - but he was denied by Carson.
