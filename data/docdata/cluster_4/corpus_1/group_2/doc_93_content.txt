 Rafael Benitez saw his Liverpool side miss out on the chance to go top of the Barclays Premier League after a goalless draw against Aston Villa.Villa fans taunted the Reds boss with chants of 'There's only one Gareth Barry' after the collapse of the England midfielder's move to Liverpool, and some of the home crowd also aimed personal insults at Benitez.John Carew came closest to winning the game for Villa, while David Ngog - a replacement for the injured Fernando Torres - was only inches too high with a chip for Liverpool.Liverpool suffered what could be a major setback after 27 minutes when striker Fernando Torres pulled up sharply when chasing an innocuous-looking pass and was immediately taken off.After 35 minutes, John Carew squandered the first clear-cut chance.Barry's fine pass played in Ashley Young who had beaten the offside trap and he laid the ball back invitingly into the path of Carew, only eight yards out from goal.But the Norwegian international opted to place his low shot rather than go for power and Jose Reina was able to block his attempt.Liverpool threatened for the first time when a deep cross from Andrea Dossena was only headed by Nicky Shorey into the path of Dirk Kuyt but his side's midweek Champions League goal hero shot into the sidenetting.The visitors stepped up their game in the second half and Robbie Keane teed up a shot for Xabi Alonso which was deflected over Brad Friedel's bar by Shorey.Then Friedel did well to tip over, at full stretch, a superb cross on the run from Dossena.Leisure articlesWhat is it about chefs that makes them want to destroy fresh crisp cabbage with some sort of redcurrant jelly?After an Anglezarke ramble my daughter and I were famished and ready for a hearty meal so we ventured to The Robin Hood, in rural Mawdesley.I had been trying to book a table at the White Bull for weeks - every time I was told 'Sorry we're fully booked'.That close knit village feel is so tangible at The Original Farmers Arms.I hadn't had fish and chips for ages so when I saw it on the menu at the Euxton Mills pub I jumped at it straight away for a midweek lunch, knowing I'd be working late.
