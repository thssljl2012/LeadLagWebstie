Joe Kinnear has insisted he is no fool as he attempts to relaunch his football career at Newcastle.The 61-year-old accepted the role of caretaker manager at St James' Park until the end of October - and with it the task of trying to drag the Magpies out of a downward spiral that is threatening to suck them into a mire of their own making.Kinnear told talkSPORT: 'I'm not scared of a fight. I'm going in with my eyes open and if I do have a successful spell, then you don't know where it will lead.'He added: 'I'm not daft enough not to know that they have tried everyone else and everybody else has turned their back on it.'What I intend to do is make an instant improvement at the club. After that, of course, I know that I won't be there.'Kinnear will take over at St James' on Monday after Chris Hughton's spell as caretaker draws to a close with today's Barclays Premier League clash against Blackburn.But he knows he may be in charge for only a matter of weeks as owner Mike Ashley, who did the deal himself, attempts to sell the club he bought only 16 months ago.Kinnear said: 'He (Ashley] made it quite clear that he hopes to have the club sold by the beginning of October.'I worked it out that I would be in charge for between six and eight games.'But he assures me that they have a buyer and the consortium coming in have Kevin Keegan lined up, and possibly Alan Shearer. I'm well aware of the situation. Good luck to Kevin if he's coming back in. He's the fans' choice and you know what the fans are like, they call the tune in many respects.'Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
