Aston Villa midfielder Steve Sidwell may be forced to again put his hopes of making his Barclays Premier League bow for the midlands club on ice.The former Chelsea player, signed for 5.5million in the summer, had recovered from a calf setback and was optimistic of facing Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Monday.But now a knee injury suffered while on reserve-team duty could scupper those hopes.Villa manager Martin O'Neill admitted: 'We are monitoring him at the moment but he might be a doubt for Monday which would be disappointing for us. 'It's unavoidable, these things can happen. But it's particularly galling as Steve has never picked up an injury before in his career. 'He just wants to get his Villa career up and running and it's very disappointing. I don't think it (the knee) is anything to overly concern us though. We will monitor it over the next few days.' Sidwell's only action for Villa has been in two Intertoto Cup games with Odense in late July.Meanwhile another summer signing, defender Carlos Cuellar, is close to being ready to push for a first-team place after playing in two reserve games following a calf injury.Cuellar was signed from Rangers for 7.8million last month. He said: 'I am very happy because I am able to play now after recovering from the injury. I feel better and everything is looking good. I didn't feel any problems.'
