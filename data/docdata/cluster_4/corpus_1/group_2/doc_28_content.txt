United States captain Paul Azinger said he was confident Jim Furyk would be able to fully participate in this weekend's Ryder Cup, despite his wife being hospitalised on Thursday.Furyk, one of the American team's most senior members with five appearances to date, was forced to cut short his final practice round at Valhalla when wife Tabitha was taken to a local hospital complaining of upper back and neck pain associated with a bulging disc.'It's not going to be a problem at all,' Azinger said. 'I think she fell down last year some time and jarred her neck. It hadn't bothered her for some time but she got a lot of discomfort in her neck from the nerves with the bulging disc.'He added: 'The word that I just got was that everything was fine, she was resting comfortably and Jim felt that, as he was hitting it great and he knows the golf course and he was useless for the next five holes, he would see her, give her a big hug and then come back for the opening ceremonies.'I don't see that as a big deal, everything's fine.'Editor's choiceA doting dad who was killed in a tragic accident has been described as a big man with a big heart.An ardent Bradford City fan has returned from the other side of the world to see his girls lead out the Bantams at Valley Parade.A Bradford girl who defied doctors by learning to walk after surviving two strokes as a baby has been honoured by The Stroke Association for her tremendous courage.Green-fingered groups feel blooming great after winning prizes in the prestigious Yorkshire in Bloom awards.Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has been arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage.The third body found at a burnt-out rural mansion has been identified as that of 15-year-old Kirstie Foster, police said.Lloyds TSB has unveiled a mammoth 12 billion takeover of ailing Halifax Bank of Scotland, in a deal set to change the face of UK banking and cause hefty job losses.Jimmy Quinn was touted as a possible City boss when they were hanging on for Stuart McCall.Four-and-a-half years after joining, Iestyn Harris leaves Bradford maintaining he has no regrets about ever making that first controversial move.
