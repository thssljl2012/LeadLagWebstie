Hull City striker Craig Fagan faces up to three months on the sidelines after the club confirmed Danny Guthrie's red-rated challenge in Saturday's Barclays Premier League match resulted in a broken leg.Guthrie's challenge in the final moments of the Tigers' shock 2-1 victory over Newcastle United at St James' Park saw him issued with a straight red card  and Fagan left the ground on crutches.The Tigers confirmed yesterday following an X-ray that the 25-year-old former Derby striker suffered a fractured right tibia.The club also stated the injury is likely to keep him out of action for between six weeks and three months.Tigers manager Phil Brown was scathing in his assessment of Guthrie's tackle.'It cannot be tolerated, it needs to be kicked out of the game,' he said. 'When you see that the end product is him putting a fellow pro in a cast, it's just not right.'That's the horrible side of the game.'I don't care what is going on at Newcastle, you cannot tolerate this.'If I go back to the incident, my players were killing time in the corner, something that every Premier League club does, no matter who you are.'In the process of doing that, someone has decided to take the matter into his own hands and lashed out at Craig Fagan.'
