Brazil striker Ronaldo has again claimed he is in talks with Manchester City and believes it is a 'big possibility' he could soon be playing in the Barclays Premier League.The out-of-contract 31-year-old reckons he is within two to three months of a return to competitive action after being sidelined since February with a knee-ligament injury.'It is a big possibility,' he told French daily L'Equipe. 'Manchester City are in the process of putting in place an unbelievable project, with some great players. We are in the process of talking to them. So we will see.'The Brazilian, who believes his recovery from his knee injury is going 'marvellously well', has played down fears about his fitness.'People can say what they want,' he added. 'Let's just say I am above my usual weight, but that is normal. That isn't surprising - I have gone five months without training.'There is nothing illogical about putting on a few kilos. They can say what they want, it doesn't bother me.'I am going to continue to work hard and to look to reach my goal, to get back playing football. Like before.'Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights ReservedThe full article contains 214 words and appears in Press Association newspaper.Page 1 of 1Last Updated:  19 September 2008 11:39 AMSource:  Press AssociationLocation:  The Press Association NewsdeskBookmark:Delivery formats: RSS, Atom, Javascript &amp;amp; EmailNewsSportLeisureEntertainmentEditorial SpecialsHave Your SayCommunityProducts &amp;amp; ServicesWhat's this?More Latest National SportFeatured Advertisingcontrol for popup windowAll rights reserved 2008Johnston Press Digital PublishingSister Newspapers:This website and its associated newspaper adheres to the Press Complaints Commissions Code of Practice.
