Newcastle's beleagured owner Mike Ashley's initial efforts to find a quick buyer for the club have hit a brick wall after he was shown the door by potential takers in Dubai. Ashley is understood to have flown to Dubai to seek a buyer but there is thought to be no interest from any arm of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's family in the St James' Park outfit.Furthermore, the family's investment body, Dubai International Capital (DIC) made it clear they are not 'planning a bid for any football club'.Scroll down for more  Ashley has announced he wants to sell his interest in Newcastle just 16 months after staging a 134.4million takeover.However he has also indicated he wants a return on his investment - 'this is not a fire sale,' he said in his statement yesterday - so that could mean it is some time before a buyer is found and the club can return to an even keel.There are already fears that no manager will take the job left vacant by Kevin Keegan while such uncertainty exists over the future ownership.
