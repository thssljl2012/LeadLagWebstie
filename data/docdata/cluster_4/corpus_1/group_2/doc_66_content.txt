Rafa Benitez has said a Liverpool win over Manchester United will galvanise their title chances.The Reds boss faces a team he has never beaten in the Barclays Premier League and one that has frequently destroyed the Anfield side's chances of taking the title. Liverpool's last home league win against United was back in 2001. They have lost the last five clashes and managed just seven victories in 32 league encounters.Benitez has managed only one victory over United counterpart Sir Alex Ferguson in nine meetings during his time at Anfield, in the FA Cup in 2006.The cloud hanging over Liverpool now sees their record of 18 league titles now under severe threat, with United just one short of equalling that total.Benitez will be desperate for a change of fortune on Saturday. He said: 'These games against top sides are always important. It is just three points on offer but we all know this is different. 'If we can beat them, with our current position in the table, it could be worth more. 'Our confidence would go really high and everyone would be boosted, but it is too soon to be talking about the title. 'We know our record is not good against them, but we feel we are improving. We will see on the pitch how close we are.'
