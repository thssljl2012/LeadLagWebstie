Michael Carrick looks certain to miss the start of Manchester United's Champions League defence against Villarreal on Wednesday night - while Dimitar Berbatov also missed the start of training on Tuesday morning.Midfielder Carrick was a major doubt anyway after limping out of Saturday's Barclays Premier League defeat at Liverpool with an ankle injury.The fact he was not on the training ground as United were put through their paces in front of Sir Alex Ferguson merely appeared to confirm the former Tottenham man's inevitable absence against the Spaniards.Berbatov's non-appearance was more of a surprise.The Bulgaria striker took a knock at Anfield but did complete the full 90 minutes and was expected to be part of Ferguson's squad for their first Champions League game since beating Chelsea in a penalty shoot-out to lift the trophy in Moscow last May.There has been no word on whether the 27-year-old has a chance of being fit. However, if Berbatov is missing, at least United should have Angolan forward Manucho available.Manucho has recovered from a broken metatarsal and with his work permit also secure is now looking to break into the first-team picture.Cristiano Ronaldo is also expected to be on the substitutes' bench.EDITORS CHOICEVisitors will have the chance to see first hand the restoration of The Leasowes to its former glory later this month.Chances are that you showered, moisturised, deodorised and perfumed yourself today - and exposed yourself to as many as 200 potentially harmful chemicals in the process.Fans of Lisa Faulkner may be surprised to learn that the former teenage model and TV actress suffers from rosacea - an inflammatory skin disease that affects one in 10 people in the UK.
