Billionaire Mike Ashley has confirmed he wants to sell Newcastle just 16 months after staging a 134.4million takeover.Ashley and his executive director (football) Dennis Wise have borne the brunt of a furious backlash from supporters in the 10 days since manager Kevin Keegan walked out in protest over the club's transfer policy.In a lengthy statement, Ashley said: 'I am putting the club up for sale. I hope that the fans get what they want and that the next owner is someone who can lavish the amount of money on the club that the fans want.'He added: 'I am not stupid and have listened to the fans.'I have really loved taking my kids to the games, being next to them and all the fans.'But I am now a dad who can't take his kids to a football game on a Saturday because I am advised that we would be assaulted.'Therefore, I am no longer prepared to subsidise Newcastle United.'Thousands staged demonstrations outside St James' Park before and after Saturday's embarrassing 2-1 Barclays Premier League defeat by Hull demanding that Ashley sell up and that Wise be removed from his post.Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
