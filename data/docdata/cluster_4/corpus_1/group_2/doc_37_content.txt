Kolo Toure denies complacency was to blame for Arsenal's defeat by Hull after claiming he was scared to face the Barclays Premier League newcomers.The Gunners slipped to one of the great top-flight upsets when they were stunned 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium, a result which Arsene Wenger revealed made him feel physically sick.'I was scared to play the game,' said Arsenal centre-back Toure. 'Sometimes people, not the players, play the game before it's started and that's a problem because there are no small teams in the Premiership.'He added: 'Against Man United everybody thinks it's going to be a tight game but when you play against Hull it's harder because you are expected to win and score in the first minute.'But it doesn't happen like that. I was scared against Hull because there are no easy games.'We are professional players and when we go out we want to play well and win.'Arsenal are hoping for an emphatic response to one of the most embarrassing defeats of Wenger's 12-year reign when they resume their Champions League campaign against Porto on Tuesday night.A competitive group which also includes Fenerbahce and Dynamo Kiev leaves little margin for error but Toure is grateful for the early chance for his team to redeem themselves by displaying their character.'We can't just think about Hull. It's true we lost and didn't play well,' he said. 'But we didn't play very well against Fulham and then we came back well in the next game when we beat Twente in the Champions League (qualifiers).'For a team like Arsenal it's always good to have a good reaction. Any team can fall down but it's about how they react to defeat that matters.'
