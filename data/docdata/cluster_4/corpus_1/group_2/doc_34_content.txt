NEWCASTLE have chosen Joe Kinnear as their interim manager, until the end of October. The former Wimbledon, Luton and Nottingham Forest boss has the job with the troubled Barclays Premier League team on a short-term basis. The Magpies turned to the 61-year-old after former England boss Terry Venables turned down the job on Thursday, following Kevin Keegan's departure earlier this month.
