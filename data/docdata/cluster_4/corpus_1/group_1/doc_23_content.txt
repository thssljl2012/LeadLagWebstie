 Organised by Pickering-based The Wilf Ward Family Trust, the mediaeval day fell victim to torrential rain which started in the early hours and continued throughout the morning. Chief executive Richard Pick said it was impossible to continue because of health and safety considerations for the public and presenters, including jousters on horseback. The decision was taken before the first show got under way.He paid tribute to the enormous effort of all staff and volunteers who had planned the event over the past 12 months. He said: The public who had pre-purchased tickets and had turned up early and the traders were very understanding. I would like to especially thank Pickering Town Council, Pickering Rotary Club, Barclays Bank and Northern Events Arena and all the other volunteers for their support to the charity.The Trust hopes some of the costs will be covered by insurance and Mr Pick added that there was a lot of encouragement for it to stage a similar event some time in the future.The three-day Pickering Folk Festival was cancelled the previous weekend because the showground in Malton Road was waterlogged after heavy rain.PICKERING Medieval Spectacular was cancelled on Sunday " the second event at the town's showground to be washed out in a week.
