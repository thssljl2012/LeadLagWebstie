 COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Former 'American Idol' contestant Sanjaya has gone from 'pitchy' to pitchman. Sanjaya Malakar is selling Nationwide Insurance in a new ad that's part of the Columbus, Ohio-based company's campaign, 'Life Comes at You Fast.' Malakar says that's something he knows from personal experience. In a statement, he points out that he went from an unknown singer to appearing before of millions of people on 'Idol.' In the commercial, Malakar visits a wise man who tells him he needs a retirement plan -- and a haircut. He sports a 'ponyhawk' hairstyle similar to the one he made famous while competing on the Fox network show, where the judges often deem off-key singing 'pitchy.' Other celebrities who have poked fun at themselves for Nationwide include Kevin Federline, Fabio and MC Hammer. (
