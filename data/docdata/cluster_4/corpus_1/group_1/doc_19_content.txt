 DAVID Bentley has targeted a place in the Champions League with Tottenham after doing everything within his power to sign for the club he supported as a boy. The 23-year-old has arrived from Blackburn in a 17 million deal and despite Dimitar Berbatov expected to join Robbie Keane through the White Hart Lane exit door, Bentley feels there is enough in the squad to mount a challenge for a place in the top four of the Barclays Premier League.By agreeing a deal that could run to 2014, the England winger has committed himself to helping Spurs get among the Premier League elite.Bentley, asked whether Spurs could get in the top four, said: 'Of course. There are young, talented players here. It is all there for us, if we work hard and give our all.'We can do anything we want here, we can do anything if we put our minds to it.'Despite coming through the ranks at Arsenal, Bentley was a Spurs fan as a child, and he described it as an easy decision to sign for head coach Juande Ramos.'It means the world,' he said. 'There's a piece of my heart at this club.'
