 The 26-year-old passed a medical at the club on Thursday and becomes the Toffees' second signing of the summer following the arrival of Danish defender Lars Christian Jacobsen. Castillo is a defensive midfielder who played for El Nacional and El Deportivo Espoli in Ecuador before heading for Eastern Europe. Everton must now wait to see if international clearance for the player is received in time for him to play in the Barclays Premier League clash against Portsmouth on Saturday. Castillo told evertonTV: 'I know that Everton are a big club who have a history of playing in important competitions like the UEFA Cup. 'I hope I can do my best for the team.'
