 Lloyds TSB changed the password of computer consultant Steve Jetley from Shrewsbury after he had logged it as 'Lloyds is pants'.BBC News reported that the bank also stopped him changing his password to 'Barclays is better'. Apparently Jetley discovered that 'Lloyds is pants' had been changed only when he tried to use the bank's telephone service and found his password had become 'No it's not'.It is good to see that Lloyds TSB takes our password security so seriously. Perhaps Jetley should try 'Leave my f**king password alone'.
