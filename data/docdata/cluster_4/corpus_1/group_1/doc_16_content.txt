 Manchester City reached the second qualifying round of the UEFA Cup with a 2-0 win (4-0 agg.) over EB Streymur - but it was the part-timers from the Faroe Islands who stole the show.Already 2-0 down from the first leg, they were never going to seriously worry the Barclays Premier League club but the visitors fought until the last seconds, their pride certainly intact.Martin Petrov scored his second goal of the tie early inthe second half and Darius Vassell grabbed another in injury-time.But City made and wasted countless chances as the the part-timers battled deep in defence until they dropped.In the end it was the visiting fans who sung their anthem long into the night, City just grateful they had got through to the next stage at Barnsley's Oakwell ground.Manager Mark Hughes left out Nedum Onuoha, Stephen Ireland, Dietmar Hamann and the Brazilian Jo, the latter being away at the Olympics. In came Vedran Corluka, Gelson Fernandes, Elano and Daniel Sturridge.But City needed to kill off the tie as quickly as possible to end any thoughts of heroics harboured by the islanders.And inside five minutes several chances went begging. Darius Vassell saw a close-range effort blocked from Corluka's cross before Sturridge had a long-range shot deflected wide.It took unitl three minutes into the second half before City were finally ahead. Vassell battled to the line on the right and lifted in a cross that Petrov - who scored the opener in the first leg - belted in from 10 yards from the left side of the box.In injury-time Vassell got around goalkeeper Rene Torgard before sliding in the second, but by now even the City fans were on their feet hailing the visitors' efforts.Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
