 Hull's fairytale start to Barclays Premier League life was brought to an abrupt end at the KC Stadium as Wigan pounced on some careless defending to claim a 5-0 win.Sam Ricketts sliced Kevin Kilbane's fourth-minute corner into his own net at the near post, before Antonio Valencia burst clear of the Tigers defence to double the advantage just eight minutes later.The impressive Amr Zaki netted twice in the second half, with England striker Emile Heskey also on target.Unaware of what lay ahead, Hull started at an upbeat pace amid another electric atmosphere at the KC Stadium. But soon they were behind in unfortunate circumstances. Ricketts sliced Kilbane's corner into his own net before Valencia netted shortly afterwards. Michael Turner headed narrowly over just 60 seconds after the restart, before Richard Garcia should have pulled one back, forcing a great parried stop from Chris Kirkland from a promising position inside the area. Zaki netted a third shortly after the hour mark and Heskey pounced on Wayne Brown's woefully short backward header to make it four. There was still time for Zaki to grab his second in the 81st minute to inflict Hull's first top-flight defeat and send the visitors into the two-week international break in buoyant mood.
