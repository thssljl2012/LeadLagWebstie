 The customers, who held accounts with the credit card company Goldfish, which is owned by Barclays, opened envelopes addressed to them but which contained the statements of other account holders. One of the cardholders who received the wrong statement, Tony Jacob, said: 'I was worried when I saw I was 10,000 in debt - but then I saw the mistake.' Mr Jacob, 58, from Sittingbourne, Kent, told The Sun: 'I phoned Goldfish and the girl at the call centre said it had happened to thousands of others.' Goldfish, which has 1.7m credit card accounts, said a fault with their printer was to blame for the incident. A spokesman said: 'We are treating this very seriously.' Barclays bought Goldfish for 35m in February after its previous owner, Discover Financial Services, which is one of the biggest card issuers in the US, failed to make a success of it. Discover bought Goldfish from Lloyds TSB in 2006 but endured problems with the business, which culminated in a 42.8m loss at the end of 2007 because of a write-down of almost 200m. The risks associated with the loss of credit card details have grown with the expansion of an online black market for fraudulently-obtained personal data. Last year Symantec, the internet security company, warned that stolen credit card details sell for as little as 25p.
