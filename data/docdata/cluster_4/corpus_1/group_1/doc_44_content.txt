 In California, a bill on its way to Gov. Arnold Schwarzeneggers desk would prohibit adults from text messaging while driving.The Senate voted 25-14 to sign off on Assembly changes to a bill that would ban so-called texting while at the wheel. Sponsored by Sen. Joe Simitian, D-Palo Alto, the measure  SB28  now awaits the governors signature to become law.Pursuit of legislation to limit driver distractions is nothing new for Simitian. He authored the states hand-held cell phone restriction that took effect July 1.Another law that took effect in July makes it illegal for teen drivers younger than 18 to use any type of cell phone, pager, text messaging device or laptop while at the wheel.Simitians latest effort would remove the loophole that allows adults to use hand-held devices to send, receive or read text messages while driving. It would take effect Jan. 1.As is the case for violating the new cell phone law, police would be allowed to pull over adults found texting. Violators would face at least $20 fines. Subsequent offenses would result in up to $50 fines.Efforts to curb the practice of using electronic wireless devices, such as a Blackberry-type device, while driving have picked up steam across the country following the release of a Nationwide Mutual Insurance survey that found one in five drivers texting while driving. Nearly three-quarters of drivers use cell phones.California, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Washington are the only states that have bans on all drivers using hand-held phones. The New Jersey and Washington state laws also prohibit text messaging. Minnesota recently approved its own ban on text messaging.To view other legislative activities of interest for California in 2008, click here. By Keith Goble, state legislative editor
