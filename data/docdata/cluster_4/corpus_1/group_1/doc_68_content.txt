 Summer signing Johan Elmander is a major doubt for Bolton's Carling Cup second-round clash with Northampton tomorrow night. The Swede damaged a hamstring during Saturday's 1-0 Barclays Premier League defeat at Newcastle and is struggling to make the game. Midfielder Matt Taylor suffered a foot injury at St James' Park and could miss out, although Wanderers boss Gary Megson intends to field as strong a side as possible. Provisional squad: Jaaskelainen, Al Habsi, Nolan, Davies, Taylor, Muamba, Gardner, A O'Brien, Shittu, McCann, Steinsson, Hunt, Samuel, Cahill, J O'Brien, Elmander, Riga, Dzemaili, Cohen, Vaz Te, Helguson.
