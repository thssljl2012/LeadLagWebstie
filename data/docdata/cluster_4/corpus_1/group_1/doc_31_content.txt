 PARAMUS, N.J."Mike Weir decided to take some of Wayne Gretzky's playoff advice to heart.The two men are currently featured in a PGA Tour commercial in which Gretzky advises the Canadian lefty to grow a beard for the FedEx Cup playoffs just as hockey players do for the Stanley Cup playoffs.And lo and behold, Weir showed up here for The Barclays tournament this week sporting some facial hair. 'Yeah, it's definitely psychology,' Weir said yesterday after shooting a four-under 67 at Ridgewood Country Club to put him at three under for the tournament, seven strokes off the lead. 'I was on vacation last week down at a lake and let it grow. (When I) got back I thought, 'Hey, it's playoff time, maybe I'll just keep it.' 'It's a hockey thing. In hockey, guys grow the beards, so I thought I would give it a shot and see if it works.' Weir entered the FedEx Cup playoffs ranked 43rd.The top 120 players after The Barclays will be eligible for the Deutsche Bank Championship next week in Norton, Mass. The field will then be cut to 70 for the BMW Championship in St. Louis and to 30 for the Tour Championship in Atlanta.The Canadian Press
