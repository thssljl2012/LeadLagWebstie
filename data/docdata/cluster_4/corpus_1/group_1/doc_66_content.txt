 Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger labelled his team's performance 'just not good enough' in Saturday's shock 1-0 Barclays Premier League defeat at Fulham.Brede Hangeland's first-half strike ensured the Gunners suffered an early blow to their title ambitions - and Wenger, who has insisted he has a team capable of finishing top, admitted the Gunners got what they deserved.'We were not sharp enoughin the first half, and our passing was certainly not as good as we expect it to be. I don't know why,' he said.'You have to give credit to Fulham; they played very well and they started sharper than us,' he added. 'We dominated the second half, but I felt in the last 25 minutes we were too nervous and wanted to just hit the ball up there rather than create a chance.'Of course it is a setback. But the result is there, and we have to make up for it by winning the next match. We have a big game on Wednesday in the Champions League and need to improve.'We paid a big price for the mistake on their goal. We should be able to cope with a corner when it comes in at low level like that.'Wenger had to agree when it was suggested his team might already be playing catch-up against Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool.He said: 'You are right. That is a fact - but we have to face it because from all our possession we could not produce many chances. Frankly, the performance was just not good enough.'Fulham manager Roy Hodgson was delighted with the three points against 'one of the best teams in the country' - especially after last week's 2-1 defeat at promoted Hull.He said: 'I thought we played well for 70 minutes but perhaps in the last 15 or 20 we were guilty of trying too hard to just cling on to the lead and moved away from the style. I can understand that. Perhaps we got tired because there was a lot of pressure, but we have to be realistic and say it is the consistency to play well for 90 minutes that we need.'Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
