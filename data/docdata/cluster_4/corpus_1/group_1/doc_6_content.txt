 Luiz Felipe Scolari got his Chelsea reign up and running with a landslide 4-0 victory over Portsmouth at Stamford Bridge - and a message of attacking intent to the rest of the Barclays Premier League.Chelsea were criticised for being cautious under Jose Mourinho. But Scolari's first match in charge suggested he wants style as well as substance, and they continued to push forward after Joe Cole opened the scoring in the 12th minute.Nicolas Anelka, Scolari's only senior forward available, headed in his first goal at home for Chelsea - before Frank Lampard put the result beyond doubt approaching half-time, scoring a penalty just five days after sealing his new five-year contract at the club. Deco, making his debut, added a late fourth from long range.The opener came when Anelka cushioned a header back to Michael Ballack, who lifted the ball over Pompey's defence with the outside of his boot for midfielder Cole to steer his finish around David James.Then Deco clipped over James and Anelka beat Sylvain Distin on the line to head into the empty net.Pompey's hopes ended when Chelsea were awarded a penalty in first-half stoppage-time after Distin handled a cross by Joe Cole.James was booked for kicking the ball away before Lampard tucked away the spot-kick and tapped his badge in celebration as he ran to the crowd.The attacking continued after the break, with Anelka twice firing over after the restart.For Pompey, Peter Crouch's partnership with Jermain Defoe clearly needs time to gel. It took them 78 minutes to combine, and Defoe could not get direction on his finish when he met a flick-on.Deco's goal came in the 89th minute, a swerving effort from 30 yards that James could only parry into the top corner.Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
