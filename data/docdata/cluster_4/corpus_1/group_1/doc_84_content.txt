 Manager Tony Pulis has confirmed Stoke are in contact with Valencia striker Nikola Zigic over a proposed move to the Britannia Stadium.Pulis revealed chief executive Tony Scholes is in Spain for talks with the towering Serbia international but insisted it is by no means a done deal.He told the club's official website www.stokecityfc.co.uk: 'Tony (Scholes) is over in Spain speaking to the player at the moment but that doesn't mean he will be signing for us.'He added: 'He is a player with great pedigree and has an outstanding goal-scoring record, but he isn't the only player we are looking at.'The 6ft 8ins striker moved to Valencia last summer, a year after joining Racing Santander from Red Star Belgrade where he scored at a rate of more than a goal every two games.Pulis also revealed the newly-promoted side are pursuing various other targets as they look to improve their squad ahead of next Saturday's Barclays Premier League opener at Bolton.He added: 'We are working tirelessly trying to get players and there are quite a few irons in the fire at the moment, but we will not sign someone for the sake of it.'
