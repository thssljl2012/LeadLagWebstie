 Gloss - A Lesson in 'Brandscaping' - indesignlive.com            Today is Sunday 17 August 2008  Saturday in Design is over for another year.     Gloss - A Lesson in 'Brandscaping' Gloss Creative aren't just window-dressers, they claim to produce 'brandscapes' - three-dimensional expressions of a brand's identity. Founded by Amanda Henderson in 2001, Gloss is a company specialising in 3D installation design for , sets and window displays. Their designs are bold, often very temporary and work within obvious limitations.Collaborating closely with event organisers, interior designers, shopfitters, and production companies, Gloss creates tailor-made designs that aim to intoxicate the senses.Sometimes I create environments that have the power to amaze and at other times the effect I want to achieve is much more subtle, something akin to the schmooze of the brand as it opens its arms in warm greeting, Henderson says.Before beginning Gloss Henderson grew her knowledge in the fashion industry working as National Visual Merchandising Manager for Sportsgirl and more recently as Creative Concept Manager for Country Road.I learned to create ultra-stylish, fast, cost effective and innovative design solutions across a range of platforms. As a designer I combine the skills of visual merchandiser, creative director, set choreographer and virtual architect, she says.Gloss have created designs for the Spring Racing marquees of Mot &amp;amp; Chandon, Myer and Longines as well as window concepts for fashion retailers and event and set designs for LOreal Melbourne Fashion Festival and National Australia Bank.  story cloud                      5 minute fix    14-Sep -  18-Sep -  18-Sep -   11-Aug -  Announced 08-Aug -  30-Jul -  see more ...
