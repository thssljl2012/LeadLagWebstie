 Harry Redknapp hailed his England quartet after they combined to defeat Everton 3-0 and lift Portsmouth off the bottom of the Barclays Premier League.Jermain Defoe, Glen Johnson, David James and Peter Crouch all underlined their claims to be included in Fabio Capello's plans for the forthcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Croatia with fine displays at Goodison Park.Redknapp said:'It's nice to have some English players at the club. Lassana Diarra will also go and play for France as well, so we've got some good players here.'Striker Defoe, 25, found the net with a typically predatory effort in the 12th minute - Portsmouth's first goal in 528 minutes - and then turned provider with an exquisite pass to send Johnson clear for a second five minutes before the break.Pompey's 2-0 advantage could have been halved two minutes after the restart but James enhanced his status as England's first-choice goalkeeper with a superb penalty save from former Pompey striker Ayegbeni Yakubu.Defoe, fittingly, had the final say with a brilliant chipped effort in the 69th minute that left Redknapp punching the air in delight, while Crouch also excelled and set up Defoe's opener with a deft flicked header.Redknapp added: 'I'd been waiting for Jermain to come good - him and Crouchie - and it was nice to see them link up together.'I'm not sure what Mr Capello will do - he's got (Wayne) Rooney there - but he will be in the squad, I'm sure of that.'Glen is such a good player that he can play anywhere. He's got everything you need as a right-back. Sometimes he can get a bit casual, but in terms of ability, he's absolutely top class.''Redknapp continued: 'The keeper is different class. That was a world-class save in the first half (to deny Mikel Arteta) to keep us 1-0 up and then to save the penalty as well; he's a fantastic goalkeeper.'Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
