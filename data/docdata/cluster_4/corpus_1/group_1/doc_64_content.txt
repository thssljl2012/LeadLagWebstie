'What I think is kind of a bummer is, if I don't play well these three weeks, I won't be in the Tour Championship,' Perry said on Wednesday. 'I mean, I've had a great year, and I think that's not right. I don't think that's fair at all for me to win three times and be kicked out of the Tour Championship, but I've kind of been kicked out of all of the tournaments anyway. I won the Memorial and that didn't get me in the U.S. Open.' With top-seeded Tiger Woods sidelined by a knee injury, Perry is effectively the leader with 99,500 points. Phil Mickelson is second at 99,250, followed by British Open and U.S. PGA winner Padraig Harrington at 99,000. Lee Janzen, the last of the 144 qualifiers, has 92,070 points  only 7,430 behind Perry.Last year in the inaugural playoffs, the gap between No. 1 and No. 144 was 15,300 points. The winner on Sunday will get 11,000 points  2,000 more than a year ago  and $1.26 million (
