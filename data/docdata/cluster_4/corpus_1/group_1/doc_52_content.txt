 AFTER receiving criticism from the green lobby for a balloon release last year, the Rainbow Centre went virtual to celebrate its 18th birthday.As part of their V Live festival, the centre that helps children with severe cerebral palsy hosted a virtual balloon release with Barclays Bank to raise funds.Players had to guess which spot on the map was the location where the winning balloon had landed and six-year-old Rosie Willoughby from Fareham who chose Florida was the winner.The virtual release raised 750 which has been matched by the bank to make a total of 1,500 for the centre.
