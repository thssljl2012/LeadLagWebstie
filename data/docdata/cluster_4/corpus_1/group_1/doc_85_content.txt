 (Inergize Digital Media)A disgruntled bank customer in England changed his account password to 'Lloyds is Pants' - only for staff to switch it to 'No We Are Not'.Steve Jetley, from Shrewsbury, England, was angry when he called the Lloyds TSB business center in Birmingham and discovered it had been changed.Jetley demanded it be re-set to 'Lloyds is Rubbish'.When told that was inappropriate, he tried 'Barclays is Better'.When that was knocked back, he went for 'Censorship' but was told it could only be six letters.Lloyds has now confirmed a staff member broke banking rules by changing a customer's password without consent and apologized to Mr. Jetley.Copyright World Entertainment News Network
