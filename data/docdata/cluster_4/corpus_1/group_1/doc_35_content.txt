  Mark Hughes paid tribute to Faroe Island part-timers EB/Streymur as they escaped a 36-shot onslaught from his Manchester City side with a creditable 2-0 defeat.City eased their way into the UEFA Cup second qualifying round with at Barnsley's Oakwell ground to complete a 4-0 aggregate success.But Streymur won acclaim from the City following for their defensive defiance as the Barclays Premier League side rained in shots throughout the 90 minutes.Manager Hughes said: 'They defended extremely well. It was damage limitation from them really, but you have to give them praise for their efforts. 'Their goalkeeper had a wonderful night, they threw bodies in the way of everything and made life very difficult for us.' Martin Petrov and Darius Vassell scored the second-half goals that ensured City are in Friday's draw for the next round. Hughes added: 'I was pleased with my lads. They kept at them and if their goalkeeper had not had such a great night, we would have won it at a canter. 'But frankly we were never in any danger. We should have won by a fair margin and we should have been quicker in possession but the key is that we have qualified for the next round, that was the objective.'
