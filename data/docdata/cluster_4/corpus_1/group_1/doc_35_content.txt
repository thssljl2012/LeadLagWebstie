 Over half of small business owners in the East of England take fewer than ten days' holiday a year, according to a new survey.One in five of those quizzed in the Lloyds TSB Business Insurance survey claimed they didn't have enough time for a single day off, 25% take less than five days off and 10% are off for 6-10 days only. Of those who do go away, two-thirds take a work-related item with them like a mobile phone or laptop to keep in touch with work and one in six have cut a holiday short to deal with a work-related issue.
