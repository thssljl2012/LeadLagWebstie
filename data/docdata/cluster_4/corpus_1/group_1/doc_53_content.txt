 Rafael Benitez will put aside transfer activity for one night at least to try to make sure Liverpool reach the Champions League group stages. The Anfield chief has pressing issues involving Xabi Alonso, Jermaine Pennant, Sami Hyypia and Steve Finnan before the transfer window shuts next Monday. But tonight at Anfield, Benitez needs to make sure that Liverpool overcome Standard Liege in the third qualifying round second leg - the score is 0-0 after the first game a fortnight ago - before he turns his attention again to the transfer market. RELATED ITEMS    By then Liverpool should have virtually tied up the 12million purchase of Albert Riera from Espanyol, with talks at an advanced stage. But Benitez said: 'I shall not be bringing in anyone today or tomorrow, so for now everyone should be concentrating on the job in hand, and that is making sure that Liverpool reach the group stages.' After winning both their opening Barclays Premier League games, but without playing that well, Liverpool need a convincing performance tonight to lift the club and make sure their European campaign is not derailed by the impressive Belgian champions. Certainly goalkeeper Jose Reina, who crucially saved a penalty in the first leg, does not believe that Liverpool will have a problem second time around. He said: 'The team have forgotten the match in Liege. It was just a bad day and we are thinking about qualifying at Anfield. 'For Liverpool, the Champions League is a huge competition and it would be a disaster not to get through. 'Nobody in the squad is thinking about anything other than qualifying. I am always optimistic and I am convinced we will beat Standard. 'But there are no easy games in Europe and we are aware that this match is not decided.' Benitez added: 'I am not even considering the option of Liverpool not qualifying for the group stages, I am just thinking about winning.' Steven Gerrard, although still not fully fit, will lead what is expected to be an unchanged Liverpool side from Saturday's last-gasp win over Middlesbrough.
