  for Cancer Research after completing a 181-mile coast-to-coast bike ride.Islander Matt Haynes, head of business development for Barclays Wealth Structuring, and five friends from the UK, cycled from St Bees Head on the west coast of Cumbria, across the Lake District and North Yorkshire Moors, to Robin Hoods Bay on the east coast in just five days.The group, who followed the original walk created by writer Alfred Wainwright, cycled, or carried their bikes, for up to 10 hours per day.They covered up to 40 miles each day, and had to deal with punctures, bogs, rough terrain and extreme climbs.Mr Haynes said: It was probably the most physically challenging event that I have ever taken part in.The route wasnt designed with mountain bikes in mind as it is a walking trail.I did what I could on the Jersey roads and found as many hills as I could to train on before heading off to meet the others.We all feel a great sense of achievement and relief at having completed the challenge and having raised so much money for our chosen charity.He added: One of the guys on the trip had testicular cancer and wanted to pay something back to the charity that had done so much to help him through his ordeal.I personally lost a close friend to cancer shortly before the start of the trip, and others, sadly, have all known someone who has been affected by cancer.The group had planned to raise 2,000, but more than doubled their target thanks to extra generous donations from family and friends.They also benefitted from a Barclays scheme in which the company matches the sum already raised.The group is planning another challenge and are considering riding across Wales or perhaps heading abroad.
