 Two Wisconsin residents who survived a plane crash in Guatemala have been flown to a Minneapolis hospital, assisted by insurance they received through AIG Travel Guard.  Sarah Jensen, 19, and her mother April, 41, of Amery, were two of three survivors of a plane crash Sunday in Guatemala. Eleven people died, including Sarah's father, Roger Jensen, and brother, Zachary Jensen, while en route to help build schools in a remote part of Guatemala. The pilot had reported engine trouble in the single-engine Cessna Caravan.Dan McGinnity, spokesman for AIG Travel Guard, said April suffered serious burns and Sarah had minor injuries.'This is a fairly dramatic case with a lot of unfortunate circumstances,' McGinnity said.He said the family was insured through the company and the two surviving members arrived in Minneapolis late Monday night. The company began working on the case as soon as it was notified Sunday night.McGinnity said the company's medical assistance team initiated contact with physicians at a hospital in Guatemala City, where the mother and daughter were receiving treatment. After consulting with the attending doctor, the determination was made April required more specialized care, so a medical evacuation was coordinated, he said.The company also is working with the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala to bring the bodies of the father and son back to the country. McGinnity said the task of bringing the bodies back is complicated by the loss of passports and other documents in the crash.McGinnity said the cost of the comprehensive travel insurance at AIG Travel Guard depends on the age of the person insured and the cost of the trip, which usually amount to 6 percent to 7 percent of trip costs.The insurance also assists with the cost of the air ambulance, medical expenses not covered by health insurance, and reimbursement of expenses associated with the trip, McGinnity said.--The Associated Press contributed to this report.
