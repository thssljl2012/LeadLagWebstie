 Ryan Giggs has warned his Manchester United team-mates they must match Chelsea's hunger if they are going to complete a Barclays Premier League title hat-trick.United's championship defence did not get off to the greatest of starts on Sunday as they were held by Newcastle in their opening game at Old Trafford.It means the Red Devils have already fallen two points adrift of Luiz Felipe Scolari's Chelsea, plus major rivals Arsenal and Liverpool, and the chances are they will be even further behind by the time they face Portsmouth at Fratton Park on Monday.With testing away games at Anfield and Stamford Bridge to come in September, the Red Devils must battle hard just to stay in touch.And Giggs, a veteran of all 10 league successes under Sir Alex Ferguson, feels United have to show the same desire as Chelsea to gain the success they want.'Chelsea did not win the Premier League last year,' Giggs told Sky Sports News.'I have been in that position. You are hungry and determined, and you want to win it, simple as that.'We have got to match their determination, their hunger and their desire.'But we have players at the club who have tasted success over the last couple of years and want more.'Sir Alex Ferguson will hope there are some developments on the striker front once Dimitar Berbatov returns from international duty in Bosnia.The Bulgaria skipper has already made it plain to Tottenham that he wants to leave for Old Trafford but so far Spurs have shown no sign of budging on their 30million pricetag.
