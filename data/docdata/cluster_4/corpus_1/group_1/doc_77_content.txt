 Malakar says that's something he knows from personal experience. In a statement, he points out that he went from an unknown singer to appearing before of millions of people on 'Idol.' In the commercial, Malakar visits a wise man who tells him he needs a retirement plan - and a haircut. He sports a 'ponyhawk' hairstyle similar to the one he made famous while competing on the Fox network show, where the judges often deem off-key singing 'pitchy.' Other celebrities who have poked fun at themselves for Nationwide include Kevin Federline, Fabio and MC Hammer. - On the Net: http://www.nationwide.com/about-us/featured-ads.jsp
