 The Queensland Fire and Rescue Service says it could not find any chemicals that may have caused people to become ill at a large Gold Coast shopping centre yesterday.The Westfield complex at Helensvale was evacuated and late-night shopping cancelled after 20 people were treated for nausea, headaches and dizziness.Police say most people got sick in the Commonwealth Bank , but other shoppers in different parts of the centre also became ill.Fire and rescue service spokesman Geoff King says air samples were taken but nothing was found.'With all the testing we still haven't been able to identify any product that would be causing those types of symptoms,' he said.'However, there is something that is making people feel unwell.'There has been some sort of vapour released within a part of the shopping centre and we have had our scientific people down testing them and we are going through a fairly extensive process to try to identify what the cause of the problem is.'The shopping centre is expected to reopen this morning.
