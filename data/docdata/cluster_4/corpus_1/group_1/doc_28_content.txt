 Luiz Felipe Scolari got his Chelsea reign up and running with a landslide 4-0 victory over Portsmouth at Stamford Bridge - and a message of attacking intent to the rest of the Barclays Premier League.Chelsea were criticised for being cautious under Jose Mourinho. But Scolari's first match in charge suggested he wants style as well as substance, and they continued to push forward after Joe Cole opened the scoring in the 12th minute.Nicolas Anelka, Scolari's only senior forward available, headed in his first goal at home for Chelsea - before Frank Lampard put the result beyond doubt approaching half-time, scoring a penalty just five days after sealing his new five-year contract at the club. Deco, making his debut, added a late fourth from long range.
