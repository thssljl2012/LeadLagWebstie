The Latics slumped to their fourth successive Barclays Premier League loss at Craven Cottage on Wednesday night, plunging them into the relegation zone. 'I've got no excuses. We were poor and got what we deserved, which was nothing,' he said. 'You question yourself, the preparation and whether I picked the right team because that was possibly the worst performance since I've been at the club.' Two goals from Andy Johnson either side of the interval were the only highlights of a poor match that Fulham deserved to win.Bruce was incensed by an inept performance that reached its nadir with some dire defending from Paul Scharner that led to Johnson's second. Bruce added: 'I know we lost by four to Aston Villa but apart from 15-20 minutes in the first half, it was an unacceptable performance. 'The second goal summed up our night - 11-year-olds wouldn't defend like that. 'We'll go again and get back to basics. We've had many plaudits all year but that wasn't acceptable. 'We must face the facts that six or seven played well below their best and that's not good enough.'Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
