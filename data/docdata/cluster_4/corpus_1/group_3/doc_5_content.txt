Evans proved his growing maturity with a masterful performance against the Czech Republic at Windsor Park earlier in the month.The imperious display came only a fortnight after a man-of-the-match outing against Scotland at Hampden Park.The 20-year-old is defying his young years by blazing a trail at international level, and also on the club scene for Manchester United.Evans was given the nod by Sir Alex Ferguson against Villarreal in the Champions League, before partnering Rio Ferdinand in the massive Barclays Premiership clash with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.And Worthington has been keeping a close eye on the versatile defenders immense progress.I have enjoyed watching Jonny get his chance. I was delighted he got playing in the Champions League game against Villarreal the other week. He certainly didnt look out of place. He coped with the situation and the game very well, the international manager said.The bigger challenge yet again was when Sir Alex (Ferguson) picked him for the game at Chelsea. It was a huge boost of confidence from Jonnys point of view, in that the manager has faith to throw him into such a game, and again he did a super job.It is great experience for the lad. He has come through against players like Nicolas Anelka and Didier Drogba with flying colours. They are world class players so the experience will have been invaluable.He wasnt fazed by the situation in any shape or form and I think it stands both Jonny and Northern Ireland in good stead.Evans partnered Stephen Craigan at the heart of Northern Irelands defence in the opening two World Cup qualifiers against Slovakia and the Czech Republic, with skipper and regular centre half Aaron Hughes moved to full back.And Worthington admits the Old Trafford fledglings favoured position is in the middle.If I was looking at Jonny Evans his number one position would be centre half " thats how I would see him, Worthington said.But Jonny is more than capable of playing elsewhere because he is a talented, young footballer. He can play at right back or left back and do either job very well.Sometimes you need players who can play a couple of positions, but if you ask me a direct question then the direct answer would be his number one position would be centre half where he is most comfortable.
