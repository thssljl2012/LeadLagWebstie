The new era started with a 2-0 win over Bolton as Spurs moved within a point of getting themselves off the bottom of the Barclays Premier League.And Redknapp said: 'The chairman will do the deals but I'll pick the players. I wouldn't let anyone else buy my players.'The new Spurs boss will now draw up his own targets and bring in Kevin Bond as a coach and other assistants, although he has ruled out his son, Jamie, returning to White Hart Lane.Redknapp could bring up to two assistants to the club and added: 'There are a couple of ex-Tottenham people who I think have great futures in the game. I would like to talk to them about coming here.'Redknapp has described the job in north London as an offer he simply could not refuse. He almost joined Spurs 18 months ago but Levy finally got his man on Sunday after sacking Ramos and agreeing a compensation package with Portsmouth.'I nearly came here, it was a long story but things happened,' Redknapp said.'I nearly went to Newcastle and people said I didn't want to take on the challenge of a big club. I felt that once this happened (with Spurs again), I would have regretted it for the rest of my life.'Confidence was starting to creep back against Gary Megson's men, but getting safe is the only thing on Redknapp's agenda at the moment.'That's my first priority,' he said. 'The record was eight games, two points, so you're in trouble. Anything else is a bonus.'Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
