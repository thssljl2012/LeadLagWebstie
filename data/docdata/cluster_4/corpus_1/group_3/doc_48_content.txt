Former Arsenal and England defender Tony Adams has been named as the new manager of Barclays Premier League club Portsmouth. Adams was in temporary charge alongside Joe Jordan for Sunday's 1-1 draw with Fulham following the departure of Harry Redknapp.And the 42-year-old has now been given the top job at Fratton Park, with Wednesday's match at Liverpool his first test as a top-flight boss.Peter Storrie, who has become executive chairman at Fratton Park, confirmed the appointment and revealed Adams had been given a two-and-a-half year contract.He said: 'It's been a bit of a whirlwind 48 hours.'I know we said we'd take our time a little bit but we had a think about it, had a chat with Tony and we feel he's done a tremendous job here and thoroughly deserves this opportunity to manage the club.'He's not only popular among the board and people working at the club, but as was shown on Sunday, it's a popular decision for the supporters.'Adams said: 'It's fantastic. I'm very honoured, it's a great opportunity and one I would be mad to turn down.'I'm very excited, I can't wait to get going. I've been here two and a half years and it was kind of business as usual this morning.'We've got some great players here at Portsmouth and I've been kind of responsible, with Harry, for bringing them to the club. I am going to take this opportunity and risk, because Harry's done a fantastic job for this club and is a hard act to follow. But I think it is my time, I think I am ready.'Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
