Cristiano Ronaldo and Dimitar Berbatov also found the net during a devastating 15-minute period for the Barclays Premier League champions, with Nani completing the scoring in the last minute. West Brom had every reason to be fearful and it appeared those worries were proved valid when Rooney tucked home midway through the opening period. Rooney appeared merely to use his strength to push Gianni Zuiverloon to one side as he skipped onto Ronaldo's through ball, but the goal was ruled out by referee Mark Halsey. United lost Patrice Evra nine minutes before the break with an injury which must make him a doubt for Tuesday's Champions League duel with Celtic. United needed something special to break the deadlock, which is exactly what Rooney is delivering at present. There was still plenty of work to do when Berbatov slipped a pass to his right. But Rooney darted into the box before stepping inside Ryan Donk onto his favoured right foot, with which he beat Scott Carson at his near post.Rooney, having got his goal, turned provider to send Ronaldo flying through. It is not the kind of opportunity a prospective world player of the year passes up. Then substitute Nani saw his low cross bounce through the penalty area to Berbatov who calmly leant back and smashed his first Premier League goal for United. Rooney went close again before his unselfish streak allowed him to claim another assist as he rolled an inviting pass across goal to Nani. Wayne Rooney continued his scoring spree to inspire Manchester United to a clinical 4-0 victory over West Brom.
