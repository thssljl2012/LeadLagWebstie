New Portsmouth boss Tony Adams insists that England striker Jermain Defoe is fully behind his appointment despite being left on the bench at Anfield on Wednesday night.Defoe's poaching qualities were not called upon until the final frantic minutes of Pompey's 1-0 defeat to the Barclays Premier League leaders.But with Defoe already being linked with a return to Tottenham to be re-united with former Pompey chief Harry Redknapp, Adams made it clear: 'I am Jermain's biggest fan.'Adams, in his first game in charge after replacing Redknapp at the weekend, may well have got something from the match had he utilised Defoe's talents earlier.He started with a 4-5-1 formation with former Liverpool man Peter Crouch on his own up front.But when Defoe came on for a last ditch attempt to save a point, it caused panic in the Liverpool rearguard.But Adams said: 'Defoe wasn't dropped, of course not. I will make tactical decisions, technical decisions and emotional decisions. This time it was a tactical one.'I want Jermain to be the top goalscorer for Portsmouth, he will be. I want him to be top scorer in the league and I think he can.'Jermain took it fine, he is 100 per cent behind me. I have had great support from everybody, but particularly from Defoe.'I am a big fan of Defoe, maybe it was crazy to keep him on the bench for so long, but next time out it will be different.'
