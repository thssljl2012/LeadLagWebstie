MacLeod failed a drugs test.A urine sample given by the Scarlets forward was found to contain abnormally high levels of testosterone and he has been suspended, but BBC  report the 29-year-old has pleaded his innocence and asked for a B sample to be tested."As part of Scottish 's anti-doping regulations a process is now under way," the SRU said in a statement. "Until that due process is complete it would be inappropriate for us to make any further comment."MacLeod, capped 21 times by his country, cannot play for or train with Scotland or the Scarlets until the investigation is completed.Scarlets chief executive Stuart Gallacher said in a statement: "The Scottish  Union has informed us that a urine test sample provided by Scarlets player Scott MacLeod has shown an irregularity."As standard procedure, while this irregularity is being investigated further, Scott MacLeod will not be playing or training with the Scarlets until the matter has been resolved."The player and the Scarlets management, along with the Scottish  Union, hope to conclude this matter as soon as possible."We will assist the player and co-operate fully with the Scottish  Union while the inquiry takes place."It is the second time the forward has failed a doping test after he gave a positive sample in January, although he was later cleared of any wrongdoing.On that occasion, a new asthma medicine that contained steroids was found to be the cause of the positive test, and MacLeod was acquitted.
