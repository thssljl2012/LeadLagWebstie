Two brothers have been charged with the murder of a banker who died after confronting a gang in a city centre.Tom and Ben Cowles, aged 21 and 20, of Costessey, Norfolk, are due to appear in court accused of killing 45-year-old Frank McGarahan.The chief operating officer of Barclays Wealth was pronounced dead on Monday following an incident in Norwich inthe early hours of Sunday.A Norfolk Police spokeswoman said Ben Cowles had also been charged with three counts of assault - one against a Lithuanian man and other offences against Mr McGarahan's brother and cousin.The pair have been remanded in custody to appear at Norwich Magistrates' Court, the spokeswoman said.Father-of-two Mr McGarahan, of Much Hadham, Herts, had been visiting Norwich ahead of a family christening when he was fatally injured.Post mortem tests revealed he died as a result of a 'bleed to the brain', police said.Detectives on Wednesday charged 21-year-old Daniel Moy, of Costessey, with assaulting Mr McGarahan's cousin.Police said the charge was not 'directly associated' with Mr McGarahan's death. He is due to appear before magistrates later this month.Speaking earlier this week, Tony McGarahan spoke of his devastation at his brother's death. 'We will always be proud of Frank and we will never ever forget him,' he said.Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.
