Seymour Pierce chairman Keith Harris is optimistic he will find a suitable new owner for Newcastle.Former Football League chairman Harris - now in charge of the investment bank - was appointed last month by current owner Mike Ashley to identify potential buyers and he believes the prospects of a sale are looking good.He told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'I'm quietly confident there'll be a good solution for Mike and the fans.' Ashley is eager to sell the club after bearing the brunt of criticism from supporters following the resignation of former manager Kevin Keegan.There has been interest from abroad in a takeover of the Barclays Premier League club, who currently have former Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear in place as an interim boss. Harris said: 'In his time of owning it, Mike has cleaned up the balance sheets and Newcastle is one of the few clubs that has no debt whatsoever, so that makes it very attractive to an incoming owner.'
