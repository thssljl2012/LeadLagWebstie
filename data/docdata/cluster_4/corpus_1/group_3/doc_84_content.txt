Peter Crouch is confident his successful partnership with Jermain Defoe at Portsmouth can thrive with England if the pair are chosen for the World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Belarus.The duo have struck up a good understanding on the south coast since Crouch made the summer move from Liverpool to Fratton Park.'I think it helps that we play together at club level. If we spend any time on the pitch with England, we will slip straight into how we play at Portsmouth,' said Crouch.'I certainly think it helps. We haven't talked about playing for England together but it is an option and it will be of benefit that we play alongside each other week in and week out.'We clicked together straight away. We play to each other's strengths. We set each other up and play very well as a combination.'In fairness, I've played with Jermain right from the England Under-21s. The fact we played together will help internationally as well but we have certain other strikers in the squad who want to play as well.'Crouch is relishing playing on a regular basis under Harry Redknapp after becoming frustrated at his lack of first team opportunities with Liverpool - particularly in the Barclays Premier League.He said: 'I am really enjoying it. I said when I was at Liverpool that I wasn't playing as many games as I would have liked. I had to move on and at Portsmouth I am loving every minute of it.'We are playing in Europe, I've played almost every minute and I've also been scoring goals recently.'I've been pleased with my goal record for England and at club level as well. I always felt, given a run of games, that I was confident enough to get back in with England.'EDITOR'S CHOICEAS the sun smiled on Burnham yesterday, it was a pleasure to be out and about in the town, enjoying the 100th year of the carnival.The first of Colchesters soldiers are back after a gruelling six-month tour in southern Afghanistan.Every day there is more gloomy news  another bank has collapsed, has been rescued or is slashing jobs.GERMAN police officers visited the Maldon district to gain an insight into British policing.A SPECIAL service for relatives of those buried in St Barnabus Churchs graveyard has been organised.
