UEFA president Michel Platini has criticised the influx of foreign owners into the Barclays Premier League, claiming clubs are losing their identity as a result.The Abu Dhabi United Group's takeover of Manchester City in August was the latest in a line of deals which has seen Britain's top sides sell out to overseas investors, but Platini felt clubs should be doing more to protect their roots.'If you bring people from Qatar and there is no-one from Liverpool or Manchester at the club, where is Liverpool or Manchester?' he said. 'I think it is not good. I think the Qataris should invest in Qatar. They should develop the football in each country.'Platini wants to introduce measures to prevent the trend developing across Europe.'Can we do something against it? I will try to,' he added.'Do you want in Liverpool an Arab sheikh as president with one Brazilian coach and nine or 11 African players?'Where is Liverpool in that? We have to make some rules.'What is football? Football is a game and this game has become popular because of the identity.'You have to have identity, that is where football's popularity lies.'
