 Ricardo Fuller's second-half header gave Stoke a deserved 1-0 victory over Sunderland to lift the Potters out of the Barclays Premier League bottom three. Rory Delap, one of three Stoke players along with Thomas Sorensen and Danny Higginbotham to play against their former club, was the architect with one of his trademark long throws. Fuller rose above Dean Whitehead on the six-yard line to power his header past Marton Fulop in the 73rd minute.
