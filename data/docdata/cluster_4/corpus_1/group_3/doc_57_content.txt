Chelsea captain John Terry insists he is fit and ready to give his all as the Blues prepare to take on fellow Barclays Premier League pacesetters Liverpool.Terry, 27, was 'gutted' to miss England's World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Belarus due to a back problem earlier this month and - as Chelsea prepare for their second home match in five days, Sunday's clash with Rafael Benitez's side - Terry stressed he always wants to be involved, whether with Luiz Felipe Scolari's Chelsea or Fabio Capello's England.'People should know what I'm like as a player and as a character,' said Terry. 'It's just disappointing that anyone would question my determination to play for my club or country.'He added: 'No-one was more gutted than me, as England captain, to walk away from the squad last week and watch them travel to Belarus.'I did everything to get fit but my back just wasn't right. I have worked hard my whole career not to miss any games. It has been frustrating the last two years because I've picked up a few injuries.'But England is the ultimate. You get picked for England by playing well for your club.'England is far bigger than Chelsea, far bigger than Manchester United because you're representing your country and we're all very proud to do it, no-one more than me.'Terry will continue to take all necessary measures to prevent the back becoming a regular problem.'I'm in a fit condition and raring to go,' he stressed. 'I have just had a stiff back which we can all get.'
