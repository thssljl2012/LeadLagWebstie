Controversial Newcastle midfielder Joey Barton will make his first start since being released from jail in tonight's Barclays Premier League clash with West Brom.Manager Joe Kinnear has confirmed the 26-year-old will be in the side for a must-win game at St James' Park, his first appearance for the club on home soil since the 2-0 defeat by Chelsea on May 5.Kinnear said: 'Joey will start. I am pleased he is back in the fray. He is a very decent player. I'm hoping all the supporters will get behind him and support him.'He added: 'Joey will be doing the best he possibly can for the club and the supporters.'Barton returned to senior action as a substitute in the 2-1 derby defeat at Sunderland on Saturday, when he was pelted with missiles by home supporters as he warmed up on the sidelines.However, he was applauded by the travelling fans at the Stadium of Light and Kinnear will hope he gets a similarly positive response after opening his heart on his jail term and the effect it has had on him.Barton's manager acknowledges his past cannot be ignored, but now wants the player to make headlines with his football.He said: 'He gives us a different option, he goes forward, he is a great passer of the ball, he has got good vision and he can score a goal himself.'He is up there with the best finishers in the club, especially in training. He weighs up the situation, curls them in from the edge of the box. His first thought is a killer pass, which I like about him. He doesn't like to go sideways or backwards.'He can look up and just drop it into the path of the two strikers, so he gives us different things.'Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
