The Football Association are calling for Aston Villa to ban for life the supporter who struck referee's assistant Phil Sharp with a coin during Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with Portsmouth.Sharp was hit on the forehead by a 50p coin thrown from behind the Villa Park dug-out towards the end of the goalless draw and needed treatment for a substantial cut before being able to complete the game.FA spokesman Andrin Cooper said: 'We would fully expect that, if the individual is identified, he would be banned for life.'He added: 'There is no place for this sort of behaviour and we will be fully investigating this matter in co-operation with Aston Villa and the police.'Villa have reiterated their determination to find who was responsible for the incident and are working closely with the police on the matter.Club spokesman Steve Tudgay said: 'The police and the club are holding a joint investigation. CCTV footage of where the incident occurred will be checked.'The culprits will be dealt with by the police but, from a club point of view, any culprit will be banned for life. We condemn such actions in the strongest possible terms.'Pompey manager Harry Redknapp admits to being appalled in general by some of the behaviour from rival supporters he witnesses in and around football grounds.He said: 'You come out of football grounds now and you see grandparents with kids and they are sticking fingers up at you and they are making filthy gestures to the team coach.'You look at them and these people and it scares me. I think it is horrific, I really do.'Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
