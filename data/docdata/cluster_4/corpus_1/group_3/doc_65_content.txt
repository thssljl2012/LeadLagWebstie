Hull boss Phil Brown admitted his side had needed to ride their luck to maintain their 'Champions League form' at West Brom. Brown's side produced another stunning performance to move joint top of the Barclays Premier League with a 3-0 win at The Hawthorns. Brown said: 'It was definitely a team talk at half-time that meant a lot to the players.' He added: 'We rode our luck in the first half. We weren't anywhere near our usual tempo, workrate or passing. 'Consequently we found ourselves with an uphill task because West Brom are a good side and if they get their passing game going they will cause anybody a problem. Kamil Zayatte, Geovanni and Marlon King struck in a 20-minute spell in the second half to secure victory but Hull were indebted to goalkeeper Boaz Myhill and the crossbar for keeping them in the game. Baggies boss Tony Mowbray said: 'From our perspective, if you take the result out of it, there were plenty of positives. 'But it is all about the result you see the next day. We missed opportunities and they were more clinical than we were. 'The first goal was always going to be crucial and unfortunately for us they got it. 'We have got to be more clinical in front of goal. We can't keep creating chances and missing them.'
