England midfielder Frank Lampard took centre stage on Wednesday night as Chelsea returned to winning ways with a convincing Barclays Premier League win at Hull.Lampard put the Blues on the way to their 3-0 success with a sublime opening goal before Nicolas Anelka added a second and Florent Malouda turned in from close range to secure the win.But it was Lampard who took the plaudits, and manager Luiz Felipe Scolari said: 'His goal was one of the best in the world - only one player with this quality can make this goal. Other players, no.'He added: 'I think it was one of the best goals that I saw in my life.'He is a very intelligent player, he played well the whole game and he is a man that is never tired.'There are many very good players in England, and one of the best is Frank.'Hull caused Chelsea some awkward moments as they rallied after Lampard's opener with Daniel Cousin hitting a post with a deflected shot and Geovanni twice testing Petr Cech.Yet after winning their four previous games to move level with second-placed Chelsea ahead of the match at the KC Stadium, Hull found their luck was about to run out.Anelka doubled the advantage in the 50th minute when he seized on uncertainty at the back. Centre-halves Kamil Zayatte and Michael Turner, impressive in recent games, allowed the ball to bounce between them and Myhill was caught in two minds as he came forward to gather at the edge of the area.Anelka whipped the ball around him to slot home and Ricardo Carvalho crossed for the previously profligate Malouda to wrap up the scoring after 75 minutes.Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
