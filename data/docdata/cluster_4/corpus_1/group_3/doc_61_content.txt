Married Frank McGarahan, 45, chief operating officer of Barclays Wealth, attempted to break up a brawl in the city centre at 3am on Sunday. The father of two young children, who lived in Hertfordshire, had been queuing for a taxi with relatives at the time of the attack. A Barclays spokeswoman said: 'The shocking and tragic death of Frank McGarahan means that all our thoughts are with Frank's wife and family as they come to terms with the sad loss. 'Frank's passing is also felt deeply by all his colleagues and friends at Barclays. 'He was universally respected and it is hard to overstate Frank's contribution to the transformation of Barclays Wealth into the strong, global and leading wealth manager we see today.' Police said Mr McGarahan had been on a 'quiet night' out with relatives ahead of a family christening in the city later on Sunday. Officers are trying to locate a gang seen running from the area immediately after the attack. Mr McGarahan was chief operating Officer for Barclays Wealth in London and a member of the management committee, the company said. He joined Barclays Capital in 1998, having previously worked at Deutsche Bank. Tributes have been paid to a top banking executive who was beaten to death after intervening in a fight in Norwich.
