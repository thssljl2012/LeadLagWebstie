Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger bemoaned Sunderland's defensive approach after seeing Cesc Fabregas snatch a point at the Stadium of Light.The Spaniard headed home an injury-time equaliser in a dramatic conclusion to the game after substitute Grant Leadbitter looked to have condemned the visitors to back-to-back Barclays Premier League defeats for the first time since March last year.'They gave us the ball and said, 'Listen, we are happy with 0-0, do what you want', and the story of the game was they didn't only almost get the 0-0, they almost won the game,' said Wenger.Asked if the result was a fair one, the Frenchman said: 'It is a result. It depends what you call fair. I believe if you take the possession and the initiative, it was all us. But they defended with great spirit and were resilient for the whole game.'I like to think usually the team that takes the initiative should be rewarded, but it is not always like that in football.'We lacked a little bit the sharpness to get them out of position.'Keane, however, launched a robust defence of his team after they came within seconds of snatching a famous victory.He said: 'I can only focus on my own team, and I am sure Arsene will have to do the same.'We played Arsenal a number of times last year, we played Chelsea, we played United - we played United here and went 4-4-2 and we lost 4-0, and it could have been seven.'The bottom line for any of these top teams, they will tell you, part of the game is breaking down the opposition.'
