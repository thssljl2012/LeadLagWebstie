Emile Heskey returned to Wigan's starting line-up for the Barclays Premier League home clash clash against Aston Villa at the JJB Stadium.The England striker missed last last week's defeat at Liverpool due to a hamstring injury but returned in place of the suspended Antonio Valencia.Wigan's only other change was to replace Mario Melchiot, missing through illness, with Emmerson Boyce, while Villa were unchanged from the side which beat Ajax 2-1 on Thursday in the UEFA Cup.John Carew missed the win against the Dutch giants due to illness but was named among the substitutes for this encounter.Heskey looked lively in the opening exchanges but, almost typically, he failed to convert a gilt-edged opportunity presented to him in the ninth minute.A corner from the right flank was flicked on by Amr Zaki and reached Heskey at the far post.The former Birmingham striker was unable to silence the large and vocal army of travelling supporters behind Brad Friedel's goal as he sliced a weak left-volley wide.Yet Wigan continued to probe and Olivier Kapo - another former Birmingham man - found the space to strike a powerful, rising left-foot shot which flew over Friedel's crossbar in the 15th minute.Three minutes later, Daniel De Ridder - a third ex-Birmingham man in the Wigan ranks - whipped in a vicious cross from the right flank which Heskey just failed to connect with.Villa had showed little in attack but they opened the scoring in controversial circumstances in the 22nd minute.Gareth Barry sent Gabriel Agbonlahor racing clear down the left-hand channel and Latics defender Titus Bramble, desperate not to be outpaced by the England Under-21 striker, made a lunging tackle and looked to have played the ball clear.Referee Mike Jones had other ideas, pointing straight to the spot for a penalty kick which Barry dispatched with aplomb past Chris Kirkland's despairing right hand.The penalty award infuriated Wigan players and supporters alike but their response was encouraging and they almost fashioned an equaliser in the 25th minute.An inswinging corner from the left by De Ridder was greeted by Paul Scharner at the far post.Friedel parried the defender's close-range header and then produced another smart stop five minutes later to deny Wilson Palacios' long-range strike.Kapo then blazed an effort over the crossbar from 12 yards but Villa posed Wigan problems on the counter-attack with the pace of Agbonlahor and Ashley Young a looming threat.
