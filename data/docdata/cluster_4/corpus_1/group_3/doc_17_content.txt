Former Newcastle manager Sam Allardyce claims Mike Ashley's takeover of the club was driven by the billionaire's desire for a quick profit.The sportswear tycoon is currently in talks with up to eight consortia as he looks to sell after just 16 months at the helm.'It is crystal clear now what the motives were for Mike Ashley,' said Allardyce, who was sacked by Ashley before Kevin Keegan returned. 'I think that he did buy the club in the hope that he could quickly sell it on for a vast profit.'The Magpies currently sit third bottom of the Barclays Premier League after claiming a single point from their last five games.'It is going from bad to horrendous and there is part of me that thinks I'm glad I'm out of it,' Allardyce added on talkSPORT.'I thought Kevin was going to get the money I didn't get - but the continuous sales and players moving in and out over the summer obviously caused him to conclude the job was untenable and the club was thrown into chaos.'
