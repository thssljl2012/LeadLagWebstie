The Portsmouth captain was subjected to the alleged abuse during his team's 2-0 Barclays Premier League win over the London club at Fratton Park on September 28. Hampshire Police initially said they would report the matter to the Football Association because it was not possible to make arrests due to the sheer numbers chanting. Campbell, 34, is a hate figure for Spurs fans after he moved to north London rivals Arsenal in 2001. A Hampshire police spokeswoman said the force had last night received one complaint about the abuse. 'The complaint will be fully investigated but it is at an early stage,' she said.
