Rafa Benitez has warned his players not to let domestic success go to their heads as they prepare for a crucial Champions League clash.Liverpool are unbeaten in the Barclays Premier League and trail leaders Chelsea on goal difference alone.The Reds began their Champions League Group D campaign with victory in Marseille and face PSV at Anfield on Wednesday knowing another three points will put them well on the way to qualification for the knock-out stages.With just two defeats in their last 29 games in all competitions - and one in their last 12 - the Reds are beginning to show signs that they could be serious contenders on several fronts and Benitez said that is a situation that concerns him. He said: 'When you are playing well and winning games, with everyone talking about how good you are, it is important to calm down and get people talking only about the next game. 'It is a dangerous when you hear people talking well about your team. Then we have to make sure we do not listen to what is being said but just concentrate on the future. But it is better to manage expectations, like we are, than be bottom of the table and trying to motivate players.'  Independent Television News Limited 2008. All rights reserved.
