Sir Alex Ferguson poured praise on his side after Manchester United came away from Blackburn with all three points.With only one win in their previous six visits to Ewood Park, recent history had been far from kind to the Red Devils at a ground which many see as one of the toughest to visit in the Barclays Premier League.However, despite their recent woes in Lancashire, United sealed a crucial 2-0 win courtesy of goals from England duo Wes Brown and Wayne Rooney.Not surprisingly, it left United's boss purring.'This is one of the most difficult grounds to come to,' Ferguson told MUTV.'We've lost and drawn games, but today was a really emphatic performance. The confidence of the team was outstanding and everyone was on song.'It was a really good performance, and the reason for that is that everyone's use of the ball was spot on. The first 10 minutes was a typical Blackburn-United game, it was hammer and tongs, tackles flying in and it wasn't settled.'But once we got hold of the ball we started to use it really well, and we controlled the match. The counter-attack was always on for us because once they were 1-0 down they had to gamble at some points. When they did, we capitalised on it.'Having started poorly in the league, United now find themselves occupying sixth spot on the Premier League ladder after a game that could have seen the reigning domestic champions win by a much wider margin.Although delighted with the overall display, Ferguson was also quick to highlight the chances that United's star-studded team failed to convert.'We missed a few chances today, that's the only criticism of the team,' he said.'We had two one-on-ones in the first half, the keeper made a fantastic save from Ryan Giggs, and I don't know how many one-on-ones we had in the second half, at least three.'It could have been a big score for us. You don't want to miss easy chances, and we missed some easy chances today.'
