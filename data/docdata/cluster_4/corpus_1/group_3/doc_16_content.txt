Speaking outside the family home in Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, Mr McGarahan said: 'We are all devastated by our loss. Everyone who knew Frank remembers him as a caring, kind, considerate, generous and funny man. He added: 'He was a fantastic father to his two young beautiful daughters, a loving husband to his wife, a big-hearted son to his mum and dad and a brilliant brother and uncle. 'He was simply a great family man.' 'This tragedy, a vicious wicked murder, ruins the life and lives of so many people who must eventually pick up the pieces and carry on.

'We will never comprehend it or truly recover from it.'
