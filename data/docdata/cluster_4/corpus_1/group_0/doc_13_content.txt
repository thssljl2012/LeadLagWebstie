 The union for ANZ National Bank staff says plans to outsource 237 jobs to India are now final. The proposal was made in April, but the company has now informed staff of the job loses from its lending services centre in Auckland and customer transaction service centre in Wellington. Finsec spokesman Andrew Campbell says staff are being offered other roles within the bank, but are angry that the company values cheap labour in India rather than employing people in New Zealand.
