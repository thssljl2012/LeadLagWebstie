  White Plains, NY - The Westchester County District Attorney's office announced that Robert Wirchansky, 47, of Yonkers, New York was arraigned on one count of Grand Larceny in the Second Degree. Between November 2000 and January 2006 the defendant, a former Claims Manager for Nationwide Insurance Company, stole over $296,000 from his employer by submitting numerous fraudulent requests for claim settlement payments. Wirchansky inserted fictitious names, closely resembling his own, into the case histories of legitimate insurance claims and deposited the resulting Nationwide Insurance claim settlement checks into his personal bank account. Wirchanskys bail was set at $15,000. His next court date is July 23, 2008. Wirchansky faces a maximum of five to 15 years in state prison on the charge. Assistant District Attorney Brian Fitzgerald of the Economic Crimes Bureau will prosecute the case. In compliance with Disciplinary Rule 7-107A of the Code of Professional Responsibility, you are advised that a charge is merely an accusation and that a defendant is presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty.
