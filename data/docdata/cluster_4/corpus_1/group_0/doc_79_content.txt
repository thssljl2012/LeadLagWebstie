 Start-rite has launched an online service in a bid to allow parents accurately to measure their children's shoes before they buy.The Norwich-based company has launched Startriteshoes.com in an effort to take a slice of the online shopping market, which some analysts reckon to have been worth more than 36bn in the first six months of the year.But as well as increasing sales, Start-rite hopes the service will mean that more children will be given properly-fitting shoes.The website offers parents a choice of methods to measure their children's feet from the comfort of their own homes.A paper gauge can be downloaded, with pre-printed length and width indicators, or a plastic gauge - more reminiscent of those used in stores - can be bought.Start-rite products have always been available through a network of independent high street retailers and this will continue to be a priority for us, but the launch of the transactional website means that online shoppers can now also access our products, said David Attwood, the company's joint managing director.As we have relied on a network of retailers to sell the brand, there are some pockets around the country where you cannot buy Start-rite, unless you are prepared to make a day-trip of it. By selling online, everyone around the UK now has access to browsing and buying our products.Mr Attwood added: While our brand is already sold online by other websites, in these cases the assumption that the buyer knows what size is required without any assistance in accurately measuring first.That, in a way, makes a mockery of the reason that children should wear fitted footwear. The point of fitted shoes is that they fit correctly, but unless the feet are measured first, how can you tell?The launch has won approval from Chris Steele, the resident doctor on ITV1's This Morning programme.He said: I think it's fantastic that Start-rite is taking this step forward and going online.It's not always possible to get to a shoe store to have your kids measured accurately, so rather than buying poorly fitting shoes that could damage their developing feet, Start-rite is providing busy or remote parents with the best alternative - quality shoes that are fitted at home and easily ordered online.Start-rite has seen a turnaround in its fortunes over the past few years, culminating in the business being crowned EDP Barclays business of the year last October.The company has outsourced its manufacturing and retailing operations to focus on the design, marketing and distribution of children's shoe.Its strategy has paid off, with the business showing growth in both sales and profits despite fierce competition within the industry.
