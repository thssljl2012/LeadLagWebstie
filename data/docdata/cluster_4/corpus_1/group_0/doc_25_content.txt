 Gary Hoffman, the current Vice Chairman of Barclays, has been chosen as the new Chief Executive of Northern Rock on pay of more than 1.1m a year, it has been announced. The current Chief Executive, Andy Kuipers, will leave the nationalised bank on August 31. Mr Kuipers' predecessor as Chief Executive, Adam Applegarth, resigned in the wake of the company's near-collapse last year. Executive Chairman Ron Sandler, who will now take on a non-executive role, said:'This is a major step forward for Northern Rock.' Mr Hoffman will leave Barclays - where he has worked for 26 years - at the end of next month and will take over at Northern Rock on October 1. As well as his basic pay of 700,000 a year, he will also be entitled to three separate yearly payments of 400,000 as compensation 'for the loss of his participation in various Barclays' long-term incentive programmes.' He will also be able to take part in Northern Rock's future incentive scheme, which will be introduced later this year. Mr Hoffman has held a number of senior posts with Barclays, including Chief Executive, then Chairman, of Barclaycard and Chairman of UK Banking. He said: 'This was a very tough decision for me. My affection for Barclays is deep and built over many years. 'Yet the opportunity to help lead Northern Rock back to strength is both complelling and exciting.' Barclays Group Chief Executive John Varley said: 'This is a unique opportunity form Gary to lead a household name in financial services at a difficult time in its history.'
