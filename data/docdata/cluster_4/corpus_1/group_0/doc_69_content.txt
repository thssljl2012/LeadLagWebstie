Officials also say the vehicles have fewer anti-theft features than newer models.Preliminary reports for 2007 show an 8.6 percent decrease in the auto-theft rate in Ohio, a slightly smaller drop than the 8.9 percent decrease nationwide.Information from: The Columbus Dispatch, http://www.dispatch.com
