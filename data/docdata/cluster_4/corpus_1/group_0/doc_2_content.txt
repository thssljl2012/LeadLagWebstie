 Stoke have signed striker Dave Kitson from Reading for a club record 5.5million. The 28-year-old has agreed a three-year deal to become Potters boss Tony Pulis' first summer signing.Pulis told the club's official website, www.stokecityfc.co.uk: 'I think he's a natural goalscorer with great ability, while he's one that will work his socks off for the team.' Kitson scored 54 goals in 111 appearances for the Royals but has decided to move on following the club's relegation from the Barclays Premier League. Pulis added: 'I've seen a lot of him over the years and have been impressed with his attitude from afar, particularly his ability to adapt to the challenge of moving into higher divisions throughout his career at Cambridge and Reading. 'His Premier League experience over the past two seasons with Reading is also an important asset for us because we need players who've been there. 'And I don't believe the size of any fee will trouble him. He'll take all that in his stride.'
