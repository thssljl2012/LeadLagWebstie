 West Ham goalkeeper Robert Green has been told he will not be sold or offered an improved contract.Green is considering his future at Upton Park after claiming efforts to agree fresh terms have been ignored by the club, leaving him feeling undervalued.But Hammers chief executive Scott Duxbury told the club's official website: 'We value Robert Green highly. That is why we gave him a five-year contract less than 12 months ago. We have no intention of selling him and will not comment further on this issue.' He added: 'The club were delighted to recognise his status as our number one goalkeeper and rewarded him with this long-term deal. 'At the time the player entered into the new contract he requested a mechanism to review the terms in summer 2009. This was and remains the appropriate time to review it.Green was voted the Hammers' player of the year for 2007-08 after featuring in every minute of their Barclays Premier League campaign.The 28-year-old coveted a new deal to bring him in line with the Londoners' top stars but was angered by the club's refusal to discuss his request. 'No matter what the figures are in the workplace in terms of wages, you either feel a valued member of your staff or you don't,' he told The Sun. 'At the moment, I don't and clearly West Ham don't care about me. 'If you put the strongest West Ham XI out, I'd be the lowest earner by a long, long way. I do not even want to be close to the top earner at the club - I don't care about that. I would just like some parity.'
