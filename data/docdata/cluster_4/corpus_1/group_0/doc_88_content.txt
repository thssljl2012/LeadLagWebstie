 South Africa still has some way to go before convincing its people to fall head over heels in love with football if the evidence of Manchester United's tour of the 2010 World Cup host country is anything to go by despite their 1-0 win over Orlando Pirates.Certainly, United have been well received in Cape Town and now in Durban during their second visit to South Africa in three summers. The Barclays Premier League champions continue to strengthen their position as the game's most widely recognised global name. Impressive: Manchester United's Carlos Tevez battles for the ball with Orlando Pirates' Lebogang Mothibantwa Nevertheless, for all the pre-match boasting from promoters, the ABSA Stadium was far from a sell out as United's second game of a three-match tour saw them beat Orlando Pirates through a first-half goal from young midfielder Lee Martin. In Asia, United create something approaching hysteria wherever they go. In South Africa, it is not quite the same. With a colossal World Cup stadium rising from the dust on a site adjacent to last night's venue, South Africa remain intent on hosting the tournament in style. What the locals will make of it remains to be seen. On the field, United won at a canter on a patchy playing surface and took the lead when a flick-on from striker Fraizer Campbell allowed Martin to creep in and nudge the ball home with his right foot in the 23rd minute. That apart, there was little to report. Michael Carrick made the opposition look limited with an assured display of passing from midfield while defender Jonny Evans will have benefited from the chance to play alongside Rio Ferdinand. Not that Ferdinand set the right example throughout. Why the England player saw fit to talk his way to a yellow card after United were denied a penalty is something only he can explain.
