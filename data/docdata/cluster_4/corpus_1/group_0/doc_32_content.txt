  LONDON (AFP) - Nationalised British bank Northern Rock said Wednesday it would axe 1,300 jobs as part of a previously-announced cost cutting drive. 'While the company will ultimately preserve a workforce of around 4,000 staff, the number of jobs lost through redundancy is expected to be around 1,300,' Northern Rock said in an official statement. It added: 'Around 500 of the job losses announced will be achieved through voluntary redundancy. The balance of around 800 jobs will be made compulsorily redundant.' The positions are part of the 2,000 job cuts that were announced earlier this year. The bank had said in March that it hoped to cut almost one third of its total staff numbers by 2011. 'It is envisaged that any further reduction in the workforce will be achieved through natural staff turnover in the coming years,' the bank said on Wednesday.Northern Rock, once Britain's fifth biggest home loan provider, was taken into public ownership by the government in February after it failed to find a suitable buyer from the private sector. 'Confirming job losses is never easy but our staff have been kept well informed and the need to contract the size of the company is well understood,' said executive chairman Ron Sandler in the statement. 'This remains a very tough time for our staff but the restructure of the company is nearing completion and we are now in the final phase of this difficult process.' The lender, based in the northeastern English city of Newcastle, ran into severe funding problems last year as banks tightened lending criteria amid uncertainty over exposure to the collapsed US subprime home loan sector.The bank was ravaged by the global credit crunch, which forced it to request emergency funding from the Bank of England last September -- sparking the first run on a British bank for over a century.Last week, Northern Rock appointed Barclays' vice chairman Gary Hoffman as its new chief executive.
