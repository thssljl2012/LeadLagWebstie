 A 23-year-old man will appear in Lower Hutt District Court today charged with bank robberies in Petone and Upper Hutt. Detective Sergeant Brent Murray says the man is charged with yesterday morning's robbery at the Westpac Bank in Petone, and has also been charged with the robbery of the ANZ Bank in Upper Hutt on June 23. The man was also wanted for several burglary and vehicle offences in the upper North Island. He was stopped by a patrol within 20 minutes of the robbery yesterday, while heading north on State Highway 2 near Belmont. Mr Murray says the man's arrest was due to quick work by bank staff in providing vehicle descriptions, and a rapid response from police across Lower Hutt.
