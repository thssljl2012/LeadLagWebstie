 The England stopper was voted the Hammers' player of the year for 2007-08 after featuring in every minute of their Barclays Premier League campaign, and was hopeful of a new deal to bring him in line with the Londoners' top stars.But the 28-year-old has been left furious after he was told that there was no chance of an improved offer. 'No matter what the figures are in the workplace in terms of wages, you either feel a valued member of your staff or you don't,' he told The Sun. 'At the moment, I don't and clearly West Ham don't care about me. 'If you put the strongest West Ham XI out, I'd be the lowest earner by a long, long way. I do not even want to be close to the top earner at the club - I don't care about that. I would just like some parity.' He added: 'Generally, the situation here leaves a question mark whether the club are rewarding success and you end up questioning yourself and questioning your future.'
