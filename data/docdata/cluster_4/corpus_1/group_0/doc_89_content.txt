 Banks have been given a further reprieve from answering peoples complaints about charges on unauthorised bank overdrafts after the City regulator announced a 6-month waiver.An existing waiver, which was designed to hold back the tide of complaints while the Court of Appeal comes to a decision on the legality of unauthorised overdraft charges, was about toend.The county courts and Financial Ombudsman Service have both put on hold cases brought by consumers who faced penalties for exceeding their overdraft limit.Campaigners at Which? said that the waiver was a necessary evil. In fact, said Louise Hanson, head of campaigns for the consumer group, lifting the waiver would actually see consumers losing more money. The clock would start ticking again on peoples claims even though theyve no prospect of getting their money back until this whole issue is sorted out'.The FSA will review the waiver again early next year. Dan Waters, the regulators director for retail policy, said: The FSA continues to work closely with the Office of Fair Trading and banks in reaching a resolution on the fairness of unauthorised overdraft charges.The financial ombudsman recently reported that unauthorized overdraft charges led to afive-fold increasein the number of people complaining about their current accounts in the last year.But some banks seem to be doing something about it.Barclays recently attempted to offer an olive branch in the fight over overdraft charges by announcing it was overhauling its current account to remove the unauthorized overdraft facility. The bank willinstead offer a personal reserve to act as a safety net, removing the need for controversial unauthorized overdraft charges.
