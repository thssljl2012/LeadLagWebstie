 PM Russia star Andrei Arshavin will not return to action for Zenit St Petersburg until he has made a decision on his future, coach Dick Advocaat has announced.The 27-year-old was one of the stars of Euro 2008 with Russia, sparking speculation he was set for a move to one of Europe's top leagues following the tournament.According to reports in the Russian press, Arshavin is set to travel to London in the coming days to hold talks with Barclays Premier League duo Arsenal and Chelsea.And Advocaat has given his star player permission to miss upcoming games in order to sort out his future."Andrei won't play until things are all cleared up," Advocaat told Russian reporters."It's a joint decision. Better put, I told him he shouldn't play and he agreed." As well as the interest from England, Spanish club Barcelona are also known to be interested in the player, while Arshavin himself admitted he would prefer a move to Spain.Whatever destination he chooses, it now seems increasingly unlikely that he will feature again for Zenit.Advocaat insists he understands the player's decision to leave and claims the club will not stand in his way."I understand it perfectly, as he's been playing here for seven years," added the Dutch coach."The wish of a player who is still young to go and shine at a foreign club is very understandable."We can't keep hold of the player if someone offers good money, in the region of 25 or 30million euros."
