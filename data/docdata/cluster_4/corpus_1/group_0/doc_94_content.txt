The remaining headcount reductions will occur through natural staff turnover, the company said.The group is a major employer in the region and is working with local development agency One NorthEast to help as many as possible to find new jobs.The company's executive chairman Ron Sandler said: 'Confirming job losses is never easy but our staff have been kept well informed and the need to contract the size of the company is well understood. This remains a very tough time for our staff but the restructure of the company is nearing completion and we are now in the final phase of this difficult process.'The job cuts come under a restructuring plan for the business first announced in March, which involves cutting back the size of its mortgage business and boosting savings deposits.The lender was at the centre of the UK's first bank run for 140 years last September after a funding crisis sparked by the credit crunch.
