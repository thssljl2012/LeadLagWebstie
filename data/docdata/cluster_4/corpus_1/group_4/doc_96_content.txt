Newcastle midfielder Joey Barton will be sidelined for up to eight weeks after damaging knee ligaments on Saturday.  The 26-year-old limped off just 17 minutes into Saturday's 2-2 Barclays Premier League draw with Wigan after being hurt in a challenge with Lee Cattermole.  Barton left St James' Park on crutches and underwent scans on Sunday which revealed he had suffered a slight tear to his right medial ligament.  A club spokesman said: 'After further assessment following scans, he has damage to his right medial ligament and will be out for eight weeks.'  Barton, who absolved Cattermole of any blame, was philosophical as he prepared for another enforced lay-off.  He said: 'I am not blaming Lee Cattermole in any way for this injury. It was a 50-50 ball and we both went for it, and these things happen.  'Obviously, it's disappointing and frustrating, and my sole intention is to knuckle down and bounce back and get fit again to help the Newcastle United cause.'
