Newcastle boss Joe Kinnear has warned Tottenham counterpart Harry Redknapp to save the price of a phone call if he intends to step up his interest in Shay Given.  The new Spurs manager, who has made a blistering start to his reign at White Hart Lane, has made no secret of his admiration for the 32-year-old Irishman, who has returned to top form after finally shaking off his injury problems.  Kinnear said: 'I can save Harry the time and money and tell him not to bother even picking up the telephone, because there is no way Shay Given will be leaving this football club.'  He added: 'We want to build up Newcastle United and get good players in, not good players out.  'And why would he want to go to Spurs? This is a bigger club than Spurs.'  That assertion may be debatable with Newcastle currently back in the Barclays Premier League's relegation zone as a result of last weekend's 2-1 defeat at Fulham, while Spurs have soared since Redknapp's arrival.  However, Kinnear is determined to address the situation by recording a third successive home win when Wigan head for St James' Park on Saturday, and Given will be a key part of his plans.  He said: 'Shay Given has a lot of presence. All great goalkeepers have it. He reminds me a lot of Pat Jennings, who I played in front of for most of my time at Spurs.  'I have the utmost respect for Shay Given, as have most people in the game. He has vast experience and he is vital to us - and not only that, he is a decent fella.'
