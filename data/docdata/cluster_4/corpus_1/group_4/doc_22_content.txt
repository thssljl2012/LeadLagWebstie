 Portsmouth could recall right-back Glen Johnson for tomorrows home Barclays Premier League match against Wigan after three games out with a groin injury. Johnson will replace Noe Pamarot providing he passes a late fitness test, but centre-back Sol Campbell (hamstring) may miss out and Younes Kaboul stands by to deputise alongside Sylvain Distin. Midfielder Lassana Diarra is ready to play on despite a knee injury which has forced him off before the end of the last two matches, while striker Jermain Defoe is set to be restored to the starting line-up by manager Tony Adams. Provisional squad: James, Johnson, Kaboul, Distin, Belhadj, Utaka, Davis, Diarra, Diop, A Traore, Crouch, Defoe, Hughes, Pamarot, Kranjcar, Hreidarsson, Mvuemba, Kanu, Campbell, Ashdown.
