Liverpool survived a test of character at Bolton to maintain their challenge at the top of the Barclays Premier League with a 2-0 victory.  The disappointment of the Carling Cup defeat at Tottenham in midweek was swept away by what eventually turned out to be a convincing victory.  Liverpool have never enjoyed Bolton's physical approach, but this time they stuck to their gameplan and won with fine goals from Dirk Kuyt and Steven Gerrard.
