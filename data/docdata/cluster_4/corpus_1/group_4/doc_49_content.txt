Aston Villa midfielder Stiliyan Petrov and right-back Luke Young could return from injuries for the Barclays Premier League clash with Arsenal at Emirates Stadium.  Petrov has missed the last three games with a hamstring injury while Young was ruled out of the games with Slavia Prague and Middlesbrough with a thigh problem.  Striker John Carew remains a doubt with a hip injury and, if he is side-lined, Gabriel Agbonlahor could again be supported by James Milner in the second striker role.  Team (from): Friedel, Guzan, Luke Young, Cuellar, Davies, Laursen, Shorey, Milner, Sidwell, Petrov, Reo-Coker, Barry, Ashley Young, Agbonlahor, Carew, Harewood, Gardner, Routledge, Salifou, Knight, Delfouneso.
