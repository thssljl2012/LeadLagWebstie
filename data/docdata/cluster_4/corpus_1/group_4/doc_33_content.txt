Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger suffered a miserable afternoon as Bacary Sagna limped off during defeat to Aston Villa that could have implications for their Barclays Premier League title bid.  Sagna picked up an ankle injury during the build-up to Villa's opener in the 2-0 win and could be out for a 'few weeks' after being carried off on a stretcher, according to Wenger.  Cesc Fabregas received a yellow card in the move that led to Ashle  y Young missing a penalty in the first half, with the Arsenal midfielder now facing a suspension for the trip to Manchester City next week.  After defeating Manchester United last week, Wenger feels Arsenal need consistency if they are to mount a title challenge.  'The performance was not good,' Wenger said. 'Top-level performances are about consistency and at the moment we are not consistent enough.'  Young won the 20th-minute penalty but had his spot-kick saved by Manuel Almunia, but he helped set up the opener in the second half.  Gabriel Agbonlahor looked to get on the end of Young's cross but Gael Clichy appeared to get the final touch as is flew past Almunia.  There was no doubt about the second goal, Agbonlahor holding off William Gallas and firing into the near post, although Wenger felt play should have been called back.  'It was a blatant foul on Carlos Vela on the edge of the box,' said the Frenchman.
