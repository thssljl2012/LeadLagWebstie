Former Villa skipper Gareth Southgate brings Middlesbrough to Villa Park insisting he is thrilled to see his old club finally fulfilling its massive potential.  The Boro boss returns to the club he left seven years ago looking to eat into the six-point Barclays Premier League advantage Martin ONeills team enjoy over their visitors from Teeside.  Southgate played with distinction for Villa - and remains a regular choice in their pick of all-time Premier League favourites - from 1995 until he agreed to go to the Riverside Stadium in a 6million deal in 2001.  It was a bitter parting, Southgate being denied a move to Chelsea the summer before because Villa refused to accept their offer for the defender, after he slapped in a transfer request in the wake of their 2000 FA Cup final defeat.  He reluctantly stayed for a further year before he got his move, although his relationship with the Villa fans was soured by his decision to switch to a Boro team, which even then could hardly boast higher ambitions than the club he left behind.  The then England regular had become disenchanted with the clubs lack of progress, although he does now acknowledge that Villas former chairman Doug Ellis was wise not to start spending beyond Villas means. Now American owner Randy Lerner is bankrolling a vibrant young squad that has been tipped to break into the top four under ONeills management. Southgate said: Villa are a fantastic club and its a different club to the one I left. Financially they have got huge backing at this moment in time and a manager with a proven record.  When I was there one of the things I felt strongly about was that Villa were a club that had won the league and the European Cup. We didnt make enough of that.  In my time there under Brian Little we finished fourth, fifth and sixth, won the League Cup and got to an FA Cup final, so it was a successful period.
