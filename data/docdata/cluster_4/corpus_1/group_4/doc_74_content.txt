Liverpool returned to the top of the Barclays Premier League thanks to Robbie Keane's first two league goals for the club in their 3-0 victory over West Brom.  Keane had only previously scored twice in the Champions League prior to his 12th league appearance for the club since his 20million move in the summer.  But Keane scored in the 34th and 43rd minutes to secure the points and extend Liverpool's unbeaten home record this year. Alvaro Arbeloa added a last-minute effort to make it three.
