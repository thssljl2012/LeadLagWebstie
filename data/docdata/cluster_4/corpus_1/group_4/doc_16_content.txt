Chelsea's England left-back Ashley Cole has been diagnosed with a small tear to his calf muscle and will be out for seven to 10 days.  Cole was injured in a challenge with Steed Malbranque during Saturday's 5-0 win over Sunderland and will now miss Tuesday's Champions League game against Roma and next weekend's Barclays Premier League fixture against Blackburn.  Defender Ricardo Carvalho (hamstring) and midfielders Michael Ballack (foot) and Michael Essien (knee) remain out.
