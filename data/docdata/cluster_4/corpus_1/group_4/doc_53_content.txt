Danny Murphy struck from the spot as Fulham edged a pulsating contest 2-1 and halted Newcastle's surge up the Barclays Premier League table.  Murphy converted the 66th-minute penalty, after Fabricio Coloccini had clipped Andy Johnson as he sprinted into the area.  Johnson had given Fulham a deserved half-time lead when he capitalised on a defensive blunder by Claudio Cacapa - but Shola Ameobi levelled in the 57th minute.
