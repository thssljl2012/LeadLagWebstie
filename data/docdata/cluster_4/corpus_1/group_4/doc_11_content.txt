Harry Redknapp insists restoring his players' confidence levels has been the key to Tottenham's stunning revival. Spurs moved off the foot of the Barclays Premier League table with a 2-1 victory over title contenders Liverpool secured by Roman Pavlyuchenko's last minute winner.'I have just got in amongst the players, talked to them and tried to be a part of them,' he said. 'I have encouraged them. I have always said everything in life is about confidence.'He added: 'I'm going to play golf (on Sunday) and if I go to the first tee and play a poor shot the chances are I will have a bad round.'If I can hit a good shot then my confidence will be high and football is the same.'It's better to keep telling people what they can do well rather than what they can't do well. That's all I'm trying to do with them.'Dirk Kuyt fired Liverpool into a third-minute lead with a brilliant finish from a tight angle.  The Reds should have been out of sight 10 minutes after the interval with Steven Gerrard and Xabi Alonso missing chances but Spurs hung in and were rewarded.  Jamie Carragher struck an own-goal by nodding a corner past Pepe Reina before substitute Pavlyuchenko completed another amazing comeback on the stroke of full time by tapping home Darren Bent's pass. 'We conceded a goal after two minutes and I thought 'My God, we are in trouble' because when they get in front it is difficult to get anything out of Liverpool,' said Redknapp. 'But I put a bit of belief in them to keep going and that's what they did.'Copyright PA Sport 2008, All Rights Reserved
