                        Henry Paulson smiles....       http://www.cnbc.com/id/27712153       Sorry for AIG...a hedge fund has taken a 1.3 million position...this is bad news for AIG....Paulson must return all WANTA money, even from the 2 lending facilities ....AIG has the wrong CEO and Director for WANTA to support it......without Wanta...the only answer for this black hole is the TARP...Congress should refuse the TARP because AIG is an insurance company and not a lender....the 2 lending facilities are just an add on to launder money...sorry to say AIG hasn&amp;#039;t corrected it&amp;#039;s business model, and again will fail, the government cannot support their junkets, they try to hide, proving this company is just not honest/credible.      President Bush needs to release the Wanta money for private use to help where i see fit.      Until that release occurs....NO WANTA MONEY IS AUTHORIZED FOR THE FRBNY to use for any reason...again, AIG must repay the $144B Wanta authorized immediately (less the 37B returned to FRB 10th of November)...since they received 60B in tarp money....which AIG should use to repay WANTA&amp;#039;s outstanding balance.        NOTE: again, Bush Sr. holds no right to Wanta money, as it was not his property in the first place and must be immediately returned to WANTA whatever amount Bush Sr, Greenspan, et. al, have taken from WANTA&amp;#039;s money without my written consent or knowledge of, since June of 1989.      yep, Paulson, you should smile more often....:)      leowanta
