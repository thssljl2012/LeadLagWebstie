ABC reports that AIG, Citibank and a number of other federally bailed-out financial institutions have no plans to cancel hundreds of millions of dollars in sports team sponsorships, even as they take billions in taxpayer support:        Quote:                             Struggling Citibank just sealed a multi-billion-dollar emergency backstop deal with the U.S. government. The financial behemoth, suffering with billions in bad mortgage-related assets on its books, recently shed 53,000 workers and saw its stock price lose over half its value.  Yet its in a 20-year contract to pay the New York Mets $400 million to name the teams new stadium Citi Field.  []          Imploding insurance giant  AIG is paying the British soccer team Manchester United $125 million for the privilege of having its logo appear on Man Us uniforms . That, despite the fact the firm is standing largely thanks to a $150 billion lifeline from the U.S. Treasury.                      Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) said that this type of spending is indefensible and unacceptable to Citigroups new partner and largest investor: the American taxpayer. Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense joked that Manchester United should put U.S. Treasury on the front of their uniforms instead.
