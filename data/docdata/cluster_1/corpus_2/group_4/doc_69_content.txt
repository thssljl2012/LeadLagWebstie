          The previous retreat, at a luxurious resort, was not for AIG executives. It was for independent agents who had sold the most AIG policies, which are a key tool that insurance companies use to motivate independent agents and brokers to use their products, as opposed to the competitions. It&amp;#039;s been done by lots of companies for many years.  This is the same argument my DH has expressed when I first got outraged at the reports. He&amp;#039;s right, in that it is a time-honored way for ins cos to build loyalty and reward success among independent agents who can choose to write policies from a number of companies.    Logically I understand this. But then there&amp;#039;s that pesky emotional opinion of &amp;amp;quot;how it looks&amp;amp;quot;.  A conundrum to be sure.   It looks like what it is.  Schmoozing at a spa.  Perhaps these very smart people could come up with an un-&amp;amp;quot;time-honored&amp;amp;quot; way to &amp;amp;quot;build loyalty and reward success&amp;amp;quot;.   Bailing their sorry asses out isn&amp;#039;t exactly &amp;amp;quot;time-honored&amp;amp;quot;, is it?
