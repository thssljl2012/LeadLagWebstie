The Fire insurance under the HDB is AIG Which i know only covers the structure of the flat.       http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10206p....w?OpenDocument       The HDB Fire Insurance Scheme was introduced on 1 Sep 94 to help HDB flat owners pay for repairs to their flat in the event of fire.      The fire insurance policy under the HDB Fire Insurance Scheme is a basic fire insurance which covers building structures, fixture and fittings (based on current standard and specifications for HDB flats). It excludes common property vested in or held in trust for HDB and any of the current or previous lessee&amp;#039;s/Mortgagor&amp;#039;s renovations or improvements to the flat and all household contents.      Currently, American Home Assurance Company (AHA) is the appointed insurer for the HDB Fire Insurance Scheme through the open tender.          U can always get yr comprehensive fire insurance with other agent like NTUC..
