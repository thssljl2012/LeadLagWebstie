    Alfred B...With no regard for human life!:  I know what....  What I will do is run over to the AIG building over at 2929 Allen Parkway here in Houston and roll on in and make sure all my employees are hard at work while I bum a trip to the St Regis in Cali off of them.  Since I do unwillingly have a stake in the company, I may as well make sure htey are earning their keep.  I here you bro!!!
