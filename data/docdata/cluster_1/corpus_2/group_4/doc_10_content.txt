                               it depends on what kind of annuity you are discussing.  immediate annuities are fully reserved and will continue to pay out through expiry of the contract.  fixed annuities are also reserved for the guaranteed minimum payout. additional interest credits are determined annually in advance based on market conditions. most fixed annuities guarantee principal and accumulated interest each year.  the problem with AIG does not affect the insurance side. AIG is a holding company that got in trouble for reinsuring CMO&amp;#039;s. most of their insurance subsidiaries are in good shape. the stockholders have taken the biggest hit.    The doctor is in. Five cents please.
