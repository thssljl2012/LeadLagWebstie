If AIG is lowering rates, it is more likely due to the usual insurance cycle.&amp;amp;nbsp; Rates periodically go up and down in this highly competitive business.&amp;amp;nbsp; The parts of AIG that are in trouble and getting the bailout are in the financial areas, not insurance.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    My experience dealing with AIG Insurance&amp;amp;nbsp;at various&amp;amp;nbsp;times since 1970,&amp;amp;nbsp;was that for most large clients (where the money was), including other insurance companies [reinsurance] &amp;quot;insurance&amp;quot; was on a &amp;quot;retrospective rate&amp;quot; basis.&amp;amp;nbsp; In other words premium was based on loss history (burning cost), on a cost-of-losses basis,&amp;amp;nbsp;plus AIG&amp;#039;s claim management fees.&amp;amp;nbsp;     &amp;amp;nbsp;    In fact many &amp;quot;insurance&amp;quot; policies were pure claim-handling services and the insured company reimbursed AIG (in dvance)&amp;amp;nbsp;for claims paid, expenses and profit.&amp;amp;nbsp; So a lot of AIG&amp;#039;s insurances were &amp;quot;cost plus&amp;quot; contracts.&amp;amp;nbsp; This is true also of AIG&amp;#039;s reinsurance of other insurers.&amp;amp;nbsp; Plus the fact that all insurers pass of a lot of their large risk as reinsurance (on an excess or pro-rata share basis)&amp;amp;nbsp;to other reinsurers, Lloyd&amp;#039;s, etc.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    AIG&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;reinsurance&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;fronting&amp;quot; of most &amp;quot;captive&amp;quot; insurance companies (subsidiary insurance operations of large corporations) were on a total indemnification basis to AIG.&amp;amp;nbsp; AIG lent their name and statutory&amp;amp;nbsp;captial backing&amp;amp;nbsp;for a fee, no risk involved.&amp;amp;nbsp; That is why AIG insurance operations were such money machines.&amp;amp;nbsp; They held up-front&amp;amp;nbsp;claim reserve cash provided by their clients and had very little at risk themselves.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    So AIG may be reducing the fees they charge for claims risk management, but I doubt they are reducing their pure risk rates.&amp;amp;nbsp; Anyway, AIG&amp;#039;s insurance operations subsidiaries&amp;amp;nbsp;are all in good shape as they are highly regulated by the New York and other state insurance laws.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Anyway, most insurance company profit comes from investment income, holding policy holders&amp;#039; money in trust until paid out in claims in future, and are fully earned as the policies expire.&amp;amp;nbsp; Most insurance companies lose money on underwriting and make it up from investing other peoples&amp;#039; money.&amp;amp;nbsp; AIG usually made money both ways as they were tough underwriters and tough raters.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    AIG is not a big factor in the personal lines and small business insurance arena, which is pure actuarial science of large numbers.&amp;amp;nbsp; AIG insurance operations made their money dealing with Fortune 1000 and Global companies.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Most state insurance laws require that no risk be taken greater than 10% of statutory (equity)&amp;amp;nbsp;capital.&amp;amp;nbsp; In practice, most insurers rarely risk even&amp;amp;nbsp;1%.&amp;amp;nbsp; Too bad the hedge funds, CDS sellers (including AIG), and other such junk were not so controlled.         thread start
