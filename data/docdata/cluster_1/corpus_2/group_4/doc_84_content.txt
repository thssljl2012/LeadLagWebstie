                        not seeing the &amp;amp;quot;deal&amp;amp;quot; paulson made...i only have the press to go by...       here is an authority, showing that exercising the warrants is indeed what needs to occur for the 79.9% ownership...Leo Wanta has paid the 123B(144B) already paid by me,(NO BAILOUT TARP MONEY WAS AVAILABLE ON SEPT 16...AND THE FED USED my Wanta money.       Restructuring AIG&amp;#039;s loan is not in the best interest, of the holder of the Warrants, besides the TARP cannot sustain AIG&amp;#039;s black hole of  pumping more money into AIG, the taxpayers are already up in arms about the junkets and waste of cash at AIG, including myself....without 100% ownership, i cannot move forward with turning AIG around to a profitable company again.....the warrants must be exercised.        http://wwwDOTconglomerateDOT/2008/09/jeff-lipshaw-th.html        I moved from litigation to transactional work in the late &amp;#039;80s, and made my bones doing leveraged &amp;amp;quot;vulture capital&amp;amp;quot; deals. Our clients would swoop in and buy up troubled companies (mostly automotive suppliers). The financing consisted of &amp;amp;quot;credit facilities&amp;amp;quot; (the closing books are sitting on my shelves here) we used to negotiate with GE Capital and Westinghouse Capital in those halcyon days of being able to own companies with very little of your own skin in the game (i.e. lots of leverage!). The credit facility would consist of a term loan and preferred stock to buy the company, a revolving credit line for working capital, and warrants as the &amp;amp;quot;equity kicker.&amp;amp;quot;       We need to zero in on these warrants, because as I read the press reports (not having seen the documents), the so-called &amp;amp;quot;80% ownership&amp;amp;quot; the Fed got was in the form of &amp;amp;quot;equity participation warrants.&amp;amp;quot; This isn&amp;#039;t collateral in the sense of an asset owned by AIG and capable of being foreclosed on if there is a default on the loan. (In contrast, what IS collateral is, for example, the shares in National Union Fire Insurance, which writes a huge chunk of the D&amp;amp;O coverage in the U.S. and I believe is nicely profitable.)       Warrants are options to buy the stock - a contract right to own in the future, not present ownership.        http://www.dandodiary.com/2008/09/articles/d-o-insurance/a-closer-look-at-the-feds-85-billion-aig-bailout/       Dave Lewison - September 17, 2008 9:54 AM    I think it is worth digging deeper on the warrants. There are many people that do not understand warrants, so here&amp;#039;s the link to Wikipedia&amp;#039;s definition:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_(finance).  If the warrants are held as collateral for the debt, the dilutive effect on the stock should be delayed until the warrants are used. Is it possible that debt repayment by AIG will in effect retire the warrants? If they are exercised, won&amp;#039;t the fed have to kick in extra cash? Does the government really own or want to own AIG?       I agree with Greenberg&amp;#039;s comments in your Bloomberg article that it doesn&amp;#039;t make sense. I think there are more details that need to emerge on the nuts and bolts of the transaction. I don&amp;#039;t think the intent is to flood the equity market with AIG stock and warrants after the debt crunch is resolved. There have to be thousands of pension funds, mutual funds and stock indices with AIG stock. My hope is that the loan gets repaid and the warrants provide an extra kicker back to taxpayers. Since the loan is only for 2 years, we&amp;#039;ll find out shortly.       http://www.dandodiary.com/2008/09/articles/d-o-insurance/a-closer-look-at-the-feds-85-billion-aig-bailout/       i understand Bloomberg has requested an FOIA on this AIG mid september loan and the restructuring.....the taxpayer has a right to know the truth of where AIG got 123B September 17, 2008....      leowanta
