I mean really this is not being very responsible and its mine and your money there doing it with.                      Off topic a bit and I apologize in advance, but I&amp;#039;d like to provide a clarification on the above - the &amp;amp;quot;retreat&amp;amp;quot; was not a retreat for AIG corporate executives.  It was a pre-planned (as in last year), annual function to reward top selling insurance brokers/agents that was funded and paid for by the Insurance Company that sponsored the event.  This means that the event was NOT paid for with any part of the $85M bailout and NO AIG Corporate Executives attended.  The only AIG employees who attended were 10 regular employees of the sponsoring Insurance Company.  The event was budgeted and paid for by the Insurance Company that hosted it.  The Board of Directors had no involvement.  Bad timing?  Absolutely.  A mis-use of the government loan funds?  No - because those funds are NOT being used at the individual Insurance company levels.   It remains at the parent corporation level.    Everyone seems to be losing sight of the fact (or is not aware) that it&amp;#039;s not the individual AIG Insurance Companies that are having the problem.  The various Insurance Companies under the parent umbrella are fully solvent and have sufficient (or excess) funds as per the various State Insurance Regulations.  However, the problems of the Parent are having an impact on all the divisions and subsidiaries regardless of whether they are insurance or investment related entities.  Congress focused on this one event and didn&amp;#039;t even bother to find out the details so now the entire country is upset over an event that money from the Government loan wasn&amp;#039;t even used for.    Sorry if this sounds cranky - I really need to quit reading these posts.
