    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              Hey....Fannie Mae &amp;amp; AIG owners... (which is all of us)   Don&amp;#039;t you just love it...................    Mortgage finance company Fannie Mae acknowledged Tuesday that it spent more than $6,000 on a golf outing after it was seized by the government earlier this year, but said it is halting similar company-sponsored events.    The KEY WORD there is &amp;quot;similar&amp;quot;    The golf outing snafu comes after revelations last month that insurance giant American International Group Inc. (AIG, Fortune 500) spent $440,000 on a posh California retreat for its executives, days after the company tapped into an $85 billion government loan to stave off bankruptcy.
