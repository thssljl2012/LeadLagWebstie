           ambest.com  still rates AIG very well, but can we trust rating agencies anymore?   AMBest insurance rating is a different animal than the bond rating services that have been under fire recently. I trust the ratings.   Is it a safe bet to stay with AIG or should we cut our losses and look for another insurance company? We have a term life insurance with a different co. though.   AIG is safe. Their insurance operations are on much sounder footing than their financial operations, run out of different subsidiaries. Even if the insurance company that holds your policy(s) went bankrupt, there is enough cash held in surplus to pay out your policies. And even if there weren&amp;#039;t, there are state guaranty funds where other insurers would step in to make you whole.   - In case AIG decides to sell their retail insurance, would the buyer abide our insurance policies with their original provisions?   Yes.
