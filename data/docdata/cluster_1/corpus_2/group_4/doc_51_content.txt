          The previous retreat, at a luxurious resort, was not for AIG executives. It was for independent agents who had sold the most AIG policies, which are a key tool that insurance companies use to motivate independent agents and brokers to use their products, as opposed to the competitions. It&amp;#039;s been done by lots of companies for many years.   This is the same argument my DH has expressed when I first got outraged at the reports. He&amp;#039;s right, in that it is a time-honored way for ins cos to build loyalty and reward success among independent agents who can choose to write policies from a number of companies.  Logically I understand this. But then there&amp;#039;s that pesky emotional opinion of &amp;amp;quot;how it looks&amp;amp;quot;.  A conundrum to be sure.   Jeanie
