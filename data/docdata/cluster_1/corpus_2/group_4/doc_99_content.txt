       New Policy: Checking Out Your Insurer  By LESLIE SCISM  Earlier this year, unnerved by negative headlines about American International Group Inc., John Laster, an 80-year-old retired teacher in Scottsdale, Ariz., moved $130,000 in an AIG annuity to a Kansas insurer. And he just moved the money again -- to a bank.  In Mattawan, Mich., a client of fee-only insurance adviser Peter Katt recently spent three weeks going back and forth about whether to buy a several-million-dollar term-life insurance policy from AIG, the best offer on the table. The client&amp;#039;s decision: Yes.  Such is the tug-of-war playing out as the slides in the stock and bond markets rattle the life-insurance industry. Wall Street stock analysts, officers at credit-ratings firms and industry executives are closely watching policyholders&amp;#039; behavior. Growing numbers of consumers are quizzing their advisers about the financial strength of their insurers.  Among clients &amp;amp;quot;there is a general concern: Where is the next shoe going to drop?&amp;amp;quot; says Jack Blair, a partner at Nottingham Insurance, an independent agency in Hamilton Square, N.J.  At St. Louis-based securities brokerage Edward Jones, fixed-annuity sales averaged $55 million a week in October, the best month in recent years, sparked by an increase in interest rates, according to Merry Mosbacher, a principal, insurance marketing, for the brokerage. But variable annuities -- tax-deferred investing vehicles with mutual-fund-like subaccounts -- were off sharply as &amp;amp;quot;a lot of people moved to the sideline in general,&amp;amp;quot; she says. Variable-annuity sales averaged $86 million a week in October, down from $121 million a week in June.  Figures for industry sales during the brutal month of October aren&amp;#039;t expected to be compiled by trade groups until later this year. Advisers say they are generally telling most individuals to keep their existing policies in place, barring far-worse conditions.  And there are disincentives to acting rashly. Some people with deteriorating health, for instance, may find it tough to buy an affordable replacement life-insurance policy.  Ditching a fixed annuity, akin to a bank certificate of deposit but backed by the insurer, may trigger &amp;amp;quot;surrender&amp;amp;quot; penalties. Some investors are beyond the penalty period. Still, buying a new annuity can involve new commissions and fees.  The bigger impact on insurers may be in how consumers place new business. Mr. Katt, of Katt &amp;amp;amp; Co., says a factor in his client&amp;#039;s decision to buy the AIG policy is that the client didn&amp;#039;t want to restart the application process elsewhere. Similarly, another client is proceeding to buy an AIG policy with a $35 million death benefit; because of its big size, it had been under discussion for months before AIG required a government bailout. Mr. Katt adds that he thinks the AIG unit selling the policy is strong.  Ron Carson, of Carson Wealth Management Group in Omaha, Neb., recently wrapped up a sale of an ING Groep NV variable annuity that promises the buyer a guaranteed minimum withdrawal amount. Mr. Carson often recommends putting about 20% of his clients&amp;#039; portfolio in the annuities because they allow people who are &amp;amp;quot;afraid of the market right now&amp;amp;quot; to stay exposed to stocks.  Some advisers recommend dividing clients&amp;#039; money among multiple variable-annuity companies.  Mark Cortazzo, an investment adviser with Macro Consulting Group in Parsippany, N.J., recommends guaranteed-minimum annuity sellers that are rated at least double-A.  Glenn S. Daily, a fee-only consultant in New York, says he doesn&amp;#039;t use stock prices as a screen when recommending a company&amp;#039;s products. &amp;amp;quot;The ratings agencies know that the stock prices have dropped&amp;amp;quot; and taken it into account in their ratings, he says. He sticks to insurers in the four highest categories at longtime insurance specialist A.M. Best Co.  As for Mr. Laster, who had invested in the AIG annuity decades ago, his wife Shirley Laster says: &amp;amp;quot;We saw the train wreck coming&amp;amp;quot; with various woes the company suffered earlier this year. But Mr. Laster was frustrated with his next move, buying an annuity from a unit of Security Benefit Corp. in Topeka, Kan. Its big insurance unit was downgraded in May and June by major ratings firms. Among reasons cited: price declines on holdings of securities tied to subprime mortgages.  &amp;amp;quot;I was surfing the Internet&amp;amp;quot; and saw the news about the subprime holdings, &amp;amp;quot;so that scared me,&amp;amp;quot; Mr. Laster says. At that point, he wanted the money in a bank where it would benefit from the government&amp;#039;s move to boost insurance on bank accounts.  &amp;amp;quot;We believe we have sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our obligations and guarantees to our annuity policyholders,&amp;amp;quot; a Security Benefit spokeswoman said in a statement. &amp;amp;quot;Our capital levels continue to meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.&amp;amp;quot;   http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122671102376430171.html    ******  ******  ******  ******  Genworth Financial Inc.
