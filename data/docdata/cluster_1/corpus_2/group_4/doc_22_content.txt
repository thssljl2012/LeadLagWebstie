 NXG Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 2              AIG bailout increased to $150 billion    The government will stand behind billions of dollars in credit default swap agreements - essentially insurance contracts that AIG had sold to customers worldwide. This could breathe some confidense into the CDS market which in turn might help the impaired ARS. Thank you Uncle Sugar!      XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX    WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters)  The Federal Reserve hiked its support for insurer American International Group Inc to about $150 billion on Monday after an initial bailout attempt failed to stem massive losses.    The new plan is nearly double the government&amp;#039;s initial $85 billion rescue plan for AIG, forged on September 16. AIG, once the world&amp;#039;s largest insurer by market value, received the $85 billion bailout financing from the government in September after counterparties and rating downgrades forced the company to post large amounts of collateral for credit derivatives positions.     AIG Chief Executive Edward Liddy said the terms of the new bailout &amp;quot;create a durable capital structure that will make possible an orderly disposition of certain of AIG&amp;#039;s assets&amp;quot; and assure taxpayers are repaid in full with interest.    Credit default swap agreements have led AIG to record $18 billion in losses over the past three quarters. Mounting collateral calls left it severely short of cash.     http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081110/bs_nm/us_aig_7
