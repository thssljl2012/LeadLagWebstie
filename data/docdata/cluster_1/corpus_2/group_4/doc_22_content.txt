A key goal is improving AIG&amp;#039;s capital structure to give the property-casualty-insurance units a better chance to remain profitable and avoid punishing ratings-agency downgrades; the company&amp;#039;s ratings have been under review for possible downgrade at most of the major ratings firms. The existing Federal Reserve loans are proving onerous at a time when rivals are trying to grab business from AIG&amp;#039;s core property-casualty unit and AIG may need to cut prices to retain some customers &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;    The regulated operating subs should be COMPLETELY insulated from the toxic waste. But if they are truly insulated there is no reason for the Fed to redo this deal. This redo says to me AIG took reserves from the regulated subs and went to the casino while regulators slept on the job.    This moves beyond gross incompetence into old-fashioned insurance fraud. There should be copious jail time for company execs and regulators both. Fat chance of that, though.      thread start
