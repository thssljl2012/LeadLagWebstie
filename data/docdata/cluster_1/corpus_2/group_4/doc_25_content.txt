Know that travel insurance only reimburses at $5 per point, but our travel window is very inflexible...If we had to cancel for a &amp;amp;quot;covered reason&amp;amp;quot; within the 30 days, instead of scrambling around trying to rent the points by the end of the use yr or rebook the trip(in our case probably unlikely), I will probably purchase the nominal cost of travel insurance..      If my trip was cancelled due to &amp;amp;quot;covered reason&amp;amp;quot; at least $5 per point would cover my dues for yr...That may be a silly way to look at it, but at least your getting something back....      According to the AIG Travel Guard Brochure, on 200 points, insurance for everyone in party is $51.50..A small nominal cost to get $1000 reimbursed if something happens to cancel the trip within the 30 day window...      Something to consider....
