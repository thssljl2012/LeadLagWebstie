SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- The weakened balance sheets of prospective buyers is hampering American International Group&amp;#039;s planned sale of three Japanese life insurance companies, according to a published report.  On Oct. 3, AIG (AIG: 2.28, +0.17, +8.1%) announced its decision to sell  Japanese subsidiaries AIG Edison Life Insurance Co. and AIG Star Life Insurance Co. along with Alico Japan.

The sale of Alico Japan might have to wait until next year, the report said.

Prospective buyers would also likely have to come up with cash for their acquisitions instead of conducting them through stock swaps, reflecting AIG&amp;#039;s emphasis on securing cash.   Initially, the sale of the three firms had been expected to spark an intense bidding war among domestic and overseas insurance companies. But major Japanese insurers have expressed caution about acquiring the units, because last month&amp;#039;s flagging share prices have hurt their own finances, the report said.  ...more...
