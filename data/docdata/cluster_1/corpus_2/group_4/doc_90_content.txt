If I don&amp;#039;t like the BBB ratings S&amp;amp;P gives this wad of subprime loans, I&amp;#039;ll take my business to Moody&amp;#039;s next time...  Edit Better answer: &amp;quot;Higher ratings were believed justified by various credit enhancements including over-collateralization (pledging collateral in excess of debt issued), credit default insurance, and equity investors willing to bear the first losses.&amp;quot;   (wiki)   We know how well getting that credit default insurance from AIG has worked out...
