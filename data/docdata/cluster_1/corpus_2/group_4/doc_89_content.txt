AIG is the largest insurance company in the world and is the major insurer of mortgage-backed securities.  With so many mortgages in default, it could cover all its obligations to investors who bought the MBS.      If AIG failed and investors in MBS took a bath, it might kill the market for MBS, which are esential if banks are to continue making mortgage loans.  One of the reasons credit is all but frozen is that banks cannot not sell their mortgage loans to investors so they are forced to hold them and have little cash to lend.  Also, AIG is an American Company that is overseen by American regulators, which are government employees.  If AIG failed due to a lack of proper regulation by our regulators, everyone would blame us -- and rightfully so.      In exchange for the bailout money, which is a loan, not a grant, the government took over 80 percent of AIG&amp;amp;#039;s stock as collateral.  Part of the idea is to enable AIG to stabilize its business so it can sell off some of its divisions at market prices rather than firesale prices.  The net proceeds of those sales will go to repay our government&amp;amp;#039;s loans.      AIG is one of those companies that is &amp;amp;quot;too big to fail&amp;amp;quot; because the repercussions of its failure would be very severe and far-reaching.  We need to address the issue of size in the near future.  We can&amp;amp;#039;t have companies that are too big to fail.      This is a bitter spill to swallow, but we&amp;amp;#039;ve got to swallow.  In the future we need to have rugulations that limit the size of those pills.
