Show Us Your Bonuses: New York&amp;#039;s Cuomo to AIG   Attorney General Continues Anti-Bonus Crusade   By RICHARD ESPOSITO   November 18, 2008         New York&amp;#039;s Attorney General Andrew Cuomo today demanded that beleaguered insurance giant AIG come clean and disclose its plans for bonuses to corporate executives and pay raises, reminding the firm that there are significant &amp;amp;quot;legal ramifications&amp;amp;quot; to AIG&amp;#039;s decision.      It is the latest salvo by Cuomo in his crusade to get financial institutions to cease paying excessive compensation and bonuses to executives even as their banks are being bailed out by taxpayers.       &amp;amp;quot;AIG has already received more than $150 billion in rescue financing and therefore should be completely transparent with taxpayers as to what the company&amp;#039;s compensation plans are,&amp;amp;quot; the strongly worded letter stated.
