 Im as Laissez Faire capitalist as they get however     These are systemic problems- Joes Hardware store can go out of business and it doesnt affect anyone but Joe and his customers who will shop a competitor from now on.     AIG however is the largest insurer in the world and if they go belluy up we go into a depression because companies like them mitigate the risks of commerce.     Insurance primarilly but not just life, auto and property. AIG literally insures bonds in the credit default swap market. If that goes down lending would immediately tighten because there would be no one to underwrite risk. That would cause great depression II and would plunge the world into a prolonged slowdown.     So while I agree in principal that it isnt right to have the federal govt bail out a private company. This is in no way a bailout     1) The government or the federal reserve is loaning 85B for 80% of the company with warrants on preferred stock to enforce the arrangement     2) Shareholders and debt holders will be severely diluted including the principal of the firm like former Chairman Greeenberg who still had extensive holdings.     3) AIG tried everything to get a private loan but they didnt wanna give up 51% to private equity because they were afraid of being broken up. They shouldve taken that deal.     4) All investment banks including Goldman will soon merge with banks because without a large depositor bank they wont be able to make money on the new wallstreet. This is the end of Glass Steagell.     5) In the end there was absolutely no choice. It had to be done. An investment bank and an insurer are two totally different animals. Lehman wasnt as tied to counterparty risk as AIG. And merrill needed BOA strength and they cant survive alone and private equity cant give them the large depositor base thye need to stay in business/     Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures
