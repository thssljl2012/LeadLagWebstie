As they say in the news, AIG is &amp;amp;quot;too big to fail&amp;amp;quot; because it would send shockwaves through the entire WORLD economy, not just the US. Unfortunately, we don&amp;#039;t have the luxury of being able to say &amp;amp;quot;screw these guys, they messed up so let them deal with it&amp;amp;quot; because the aftermath would be too far-reaching.     THEN WHY ARENT THEY BROKEN UP AS A MONOPOLY? IF THEY HAVE CORNERED THE MARKET TO SUCH A DEGREE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BREAK THEM UP AND NOT RELY ON ONE COMPANY TO COVER SOO MUCH. LETS NOT PUT ALL OUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET AS THE SAYING GOES.
