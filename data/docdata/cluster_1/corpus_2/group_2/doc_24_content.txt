          Hank Greenburg AIG and The Global Crime Syndicate  http://www.mail-archive.com/cia_tradecraft@yahoogroups.com/msg00599.html  Stephen Calkins Thu, 08 Dec 2005 01:06:40 -0800 &amp;amp;nbsp;Hi Sec Hum Folks!, Here is a little more insight into Hank Greenberg and the Global Criminal Elite. The article also shows more ties of William Clinton to this global criminal scheming.  Maurice &amp;amp;quot;Hank&amp;amp;#8220; Greenberg, AIG and the Burning Down of the Madhouse By: Dr. Stefan G. E. Grossmann,  www.gallerize.com  April 05, 2005 (excerpt)  http://www.cloakanddagger.ca/media/Grossmann/Wall%20Street/Wall_Street_Terrorist.htm  Maurice &amp;amp;quot;Hank&amp;amp;#8220; Greenberg, age 79, is living proof to the insight that the insurance industry is full of crooks. The recent news about AIG, Maurice Greenberg, his two sons and Warren Buffett indicates that the inside attacks of 9-11-1 are a huge accounting fraud - a mega-Enron - of the U.S. insurance industry. Initially, the insurance industry had to pay several billion $$ in damages. However, 9-11-1 has changed the landscape of insurance risk in such a way that premiums went into a steep hike, and today the U.S. insurance industry is the major beneficiary of 9-11-1 to the tune of over $13 billion increase (in 2004) for AIG alone (AIG alone thus achieved record revenues in 2004 of $100 billion according to preliminary figures). The beneficiary of a crime is always a prime suspect of a crime. Here: the driving force behind the insurance industry. The Greenbergs, father and two sons, and Warren Buffett, their partner apparent in another Enron-size accounting fraud. Here are two outlines of the evidence &amp;amp;#8211; basically, an insurance fraud involving a rigged building demolition and the mass-murder of several thousand people:  http://www.plaguepuppy.net/public_html/letters/tom.htm   http://www.cloakanddagger.ca/media/Grossmann/Four%20Horsemen/066%20Four%20Riders%20of%209-11%20Apocalypse.htm(scroll  down to section III) Here is a more detailed report in PDF format on the GreenbergKissinger-Blackstone insurance fraud connection and the insider trading of options around 9-11-1:http://www.plaguepuppy.net/public_html/Confronting%20the%20Evidence/911_Science_Report_App_D.pdf  The following section provides some insight why the Attorney General, Eliot Spitzer, is not doing his duty of prosecuting and investigating crimes: Conveniently, Greenberg together with his contacts has been able to hoist a company lawyer into the position of criminal prosecutor. That fellow&amp;amp;#8217;s name is Eliot Spitzer, posing as a rabid guardian of the criminal code, but in reality doing nothing else than prosecuting serial killers for shoplifting and otherwise sitting on his hands to let the law rot. If these people hope that the truth will drop dead or go away they are mistaken. The truth is knocking loudly on their door and calling their name. Eliot Spitzer&amp;amp;#8217;s prosecution against Greenberg and AIG is an ersatz prosecution &amp;amp;#8211; a sham intended as a diversion. The idea behind this is that if Spitzer appear aggressive enough and the media convey this image convincingly, any true and meaningful reporting of AIG&amp;amp;#8217;s and Greenberg&amp;amp;#8217;s terroristic and treasonable felonies can be avoided. In other words, Eliot Spitzer, a former partner of AIG&amp;amp;#8217;s corporate lawfirm Skadden Arps, who some say is a crooked operation, is doing everything to save a major client of his former lawfirm. Or in short: friends help friends. Eliot Spitzer has been provided with a Citizens&amp;amp;#8217; Complaint about the criminal aspects of 9-11-1, including numerous details about the specific and tangible insurance fraud involving Silverstein, Blackstone Group, Greenberg, Kissinger together with a research DVD full of data. Spitzer is stubbornly refusing to act on the evidence and is trying to take refuge to a mere mockery of prosecution. The Christian Science Monitor, &amp;amp;quot;A Top Insurance Company as the New Enron?&amp;amp;#8220; (April 01, 2005), at  http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0401/p03s01-usju.html  writes: Because AIG is so massive and important to the financial world, regulators will have to tread carefully. The company&amp;amp;#8217;s main business is providing reinsurance, that is, it insures insurance companies. This helps the industry to spread its risk among many large and financially sound companies so a single event does not become a financial disaster for one company.  A deal between Greenberg/AIG and another grandee of the American insurance industry, Warren Buffett amount to a $1.77 billion accounting fraud which actually has been admitted by AIG. As a consequence of this fraud and the insurance investigation of Eliot Spitzer, Maurice Greenberg resigned as the all-powerful CEO of AIG on March 15, 2005; and he resigned his position as non-executive AIG Chairman on April 3, 2005. Until Greenberg&amp;amp;#8217;s resignation, the Greenberg family (Greenberg Sr. and his two sons Jeffrey and Evan) together with Warren Buffett control the better part of the U.S. insurance industry. Jeffrey Greenberg was CEO and chairman of the world&amp;amp;#8217;s second-largest insurance broker Marsh &amp;amp;amp; McLennan (resigned in October 2004). Evan Greenberg is President and CEO of Ace Limited, a Bermuda-based insurer. Warren Buffett owns and controls General Reinsurance. Last November, AIG agreed to pay $126 million to settle allegations of securities fraud by the SEC and the Justice Department related to three 2001 transactions it made with PNC Financial Services Group Inc. that allegedly helped the Pittsburgh-based banking company artificially inflate its earnings. AIG, without admitting or denying guilt, also settled civil-fraud charges with the SEC, with another company paying a $10 million fine. Greenberg Sr. owns nearly 2% but through offshore companies controls about another 12% of the stock of AIG. The connection with Warren Buffett is all the more suspicious in light of the substantiated indication of CIA money laundering through a bank partly owned by Berkshire Hathaway, Wells Fargo Bank, and the strange ongoings at the Offutt Air Base on 9-11-1 where Buffett met with President George W. Bush. Maurice &amp;amp;#8216;Hank&amp;amp;#8217; Greenberg, the president and chief executive officer of American International Group (AIG), a multi-billion dollar New York-based insurance company &amp;amp;#8230;, is no run-of-the-mill insurance salesman. Since taking over the Shanghai and New York-based insurance business of Cornelius Vander Starr in 1968, Greenberg has emerged as one of the most powerful behind-the-scenes political fixers in the Anglo-American Establishment. He is vice chairman of the New York Council on Foreign Relations. He is a member of the Board of Counselors of the Washington, D. C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), which serves, on occasion, as Wall Street&amp;amp;#8217;s private sector equivalent of the CIA&amp;amp;#8217;s Directorate of Operations.&amp;amp;#8221; [Note: Philip Manuel, the investigator, is a member of the Financial Crimes Task Force of the CSIS, see at   http://www.csis.org/taskfina.html . Although Greenberg is a lifetime Republican, his name was prominently circulated as a possible replacement for James Woolsey, as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, during the first Clinton administration.&amp;amp;#8221;  &amp;amp;quot;Greenberg is also the oldest and largest paying client of Henry Kissinger&amp;amp;#8217;s &amp;amp;#8216;consulting firm,&amp;amp;#8217; Kissinger Associates. Greenberg hired Kissinger as his chief international trouble-shooter in 1982, and has been plowing millions of dollars a year into Kissinger&amp;amp;#8217;s coffers ever since.&amp;amp;#8221; &amp;amp;quot;The Kissinger connection has brought Greenberg an inside track on lucrative insurance and banking deals with both Peking and Moscow. In China&amp;amp;#8217;s financial hub, Shanghai, Greenberg&amp;amp;#8217;s AIG is the only foreign company with Chinese government approval to sell insurance policies to the city&amp;amp;#8217;s 13 million native Chinese.&amp;amp;#8221;  &amp;amp;quot;Greenberg was introduced to C.V. Starr in 1961, after working for nearly a decade for Continental Casualties. The introduction was made by insurance executive Milburn Smith. Seven years later, whenStarr died, Greenberg took over the business, according to profiles of Greenberg published in Business Week and Barron&amp;amp;#8217;s.&amp;amp;#8221; &amp;amp;quot;Starr had launched his insurance operation in Shanghai in 1919, first selling policies to the large Russian migr community, and the British circles who were still kicking around China, following the Opium Wars.&amp;amp;#8221; &amp;amp;quot;Sources in the Philippines who are familiar with Starr&amp;amp;#8217;s early operations, link his success to the fact that he was close with Peter Aleksandrovich Badmayev, a leading Asian representative of the Soviet Cheka&amp;amp;#8217;s Felix Dzershinskii, and Badmayev&amp;amp;#8217;s close friend, Sidney Reilly, the so-called &amp;amp;#8216;ace of spies,&amp;amp;#8217; who worked for both British and Bolshevik intelligence services.&amp;amp;#8221;  &amp;amp;quot;At the outset of World War II, Starr became an intelligence asset of the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the wartime predecessor to the CIA. Starr&amp;amp;#8217;s OSS links landed him an entry to the emerging postwar &amp;amp;#8216;bankers CIA&amp;amp;#8217; apparatus.&amp;amp;#8221; &amp;amp;quot;When Greenberg took over from Starr, the firm&amp;amp;#8217;s reputation for merging business interests with Anglo-American intelligence operations did not diminish.&amp;amp;#8220; Greenberg was more than an &amp;amp;quot;intellectual asset&amp;amp;#8221; for the Philippines coup plotters. A former high ranking CIA official in the Reagan administration named Hank Greenberg as being intimately involved in the overthrow of Marcos. Greenberg, according to the source, called upon his good friend, William Casey, to add his weight to the plot, and the CIA boss obliged. Greenberg&amp;amp;#8217;s zeal to dump Marcos was largely a matter of &amp;amp;#8222;business.&amp;amp;#8221; As the owner of the major insurance company in the Philippines, Philippine-American Life Insurance, Greenberg was the underwriter for all of the banks in the Philippines.
