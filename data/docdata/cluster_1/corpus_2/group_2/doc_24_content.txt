       &amp;amp;quot;Frankly if the Fed gives AIG a bridge loan, they should take about 80% of the equity. Fair is fair. When your the loan shark of last resort, the rates should be appropriately (and nearly prohibitively) high to discourage beggars.&amp;amp;quot;   It really does not matter from AIG stockholders perspective, AIG is done one way or the other.. Even if they get a bridge loan, Fed will extract penalty from extending the credit. Then they have to sell asset in this environment (wether real business or security paper) mean taking big loss.. And couple it with their leverage, the value of the company is going out from the front door. And then everyone will try to unwind their trade with AIG (derivatives etc.) and insurance business will go somewhere else. It is dying either a slow death or a fast death.  The question really is what would happen in BK court.. I never deal with a BK of an insurance company. Anyone know what is the sequence of events?    Everyone seems to be safeguarding their cash given the size of the repo Fed has to do, look like institution are preparing for the event that AIG default. But yesterday bid for repo is unsettling. CNBC mentioned 400+B (??) request and Fed only fill 70B. And today they filled another 50B.. What happened to the other 300+B repo request? Where do they get their money to fill their needs??  I have been selling stuff to raise cash. I think I am as ready as ever..  All kind of debt (CEF, preferred, bond fund etc..) are being sold off today.. I think retail and institution income investors all panic together now...
