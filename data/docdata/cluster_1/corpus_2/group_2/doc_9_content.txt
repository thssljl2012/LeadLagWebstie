It might me necessary to bail out AIG, I just don&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;s fair to cover the ass of one company because of bad management, when other smaller companies would not even be considered for such things. (ie. Joe&amp;#039;s Diner)                               The first difference is that AIG stands as a financial intermediary, insurer and reinsurer in a huge number of situiations.  If Joe&amp;#039;s diner fails, that may affect Joe, his employees and the businesses that are in the immediate area, but if AIG fails that affects Bank of America, Chase, JP Morgan, lots and lots of leasing companies, Travelers Insurance, Wachovia...it&amp;#039;s probably a shorter list to name the companies that do *not* have some exposure to AIG.  Worse, AIG doesn&amp;#039;t even have to go under, their being downgraded has already caused a lot of problems in a large number of financial transactions that were counting on them maintaining a high credit rating.  To take an easy example, let&amp;#039;s say you liek to fly in airplanes....AIG&amp;#039;s aircraft leasing subsidiary finances or backstops the financing on a lot of them, and AIG&amp;#039;s downgrade puts that company in a precarious position, which puts lenders involved in a precarious position which makes them think about repossessing planes, which puts many of the major airlines (many of which lease their planes) in danger.      So there is a disparate effect on the economy between Joe&amp;#039;s Diner and AIG.   The fall of AIG could trigger a panic, the fall of Joe&amp;#039;s Diner, probably not.      The second reason is that AIG has a lot going for it.  It has $78 billion worth of equity right now, despite its losses (almost all of which were generated by one subsidiary, AIG Financial Propducts).  That means if you take the (book) value all their assets and subtract the book value of all their liabilities, they should have $78 billion of assets left over.  If you let AIG FP go bankrupt  and leave the parent alone (which means the creditors of AIG FP are screwed, but would leave all its insurance operations intact, AIG is still earning a net profit.  At the end of the last fiscal year, despite the losses by AIG FP, AIG still manages to earn $6 billion in net profits.  This year it is losing money, so far, though those losses are again ties to their participation in the financial products.  (Though I suppose the aircraft lease products are &amp;amp;quot;financial products&amp;amp;quot; as well, and that sub makes a tidy profit and is estimated to be worth $11 billion all by itself.)      AIG has a lot more ability to repay $80 billion in loans than Joe&amp;#039;s Diner.  Many restaurants have negative equity, where their liabilities exceed their assets.
