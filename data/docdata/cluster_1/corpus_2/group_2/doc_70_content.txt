            Quote from: blueduster on  Yesterday  at 04:30:52 PM    evidently they were one of the ones buying futures to drive the prices up.    If they were speculating and this is investigated, there will be another enron.   I hope that they are convicted and then released into a stadium full of the hard working people that lost all of their money and people who are going broke trying to put gas in their car.  Now AIG has been given permission to access $20 Billion (20,000 million) in assets from subsidiary companies to use as capital.&amp;amp;nbsp; What this means is that the parent corp that own the smaller corp gets to use those smaller companies money as their personal piggy bank. And if that money fails to save the parent company, then the subsidiary also loses.&amp;amp;nbsp;   Imagine that the parent company of your insurance company is AIG. They screw up after they use the funds to shore up their business. Now imagine that you suffer a catastrophic loss of your home. Now imagine that the insurance company can&amp;amp;#039;t pay out or offers a lot less because they do not have the money to pay you.  This is what is wrong.  Yes there are supposed to be safeguards, but they do not seem to be working.  Bastards.
