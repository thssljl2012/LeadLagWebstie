I work in a financial institution that does business with AIG. They&amp;#039;re our largest annuity and insurance provider, in fact. And now we&amp;#039;re being told not to accept any new money not just into AIG but also for three other companies as well. Some of the states are &amp;#039;fairly confident&amp;#039; that they can insure AIG losses up to $100,000 per insured in case it goes belly up without a buyout but...    ...yeah. Ouch.
