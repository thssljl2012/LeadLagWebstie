Banks led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. couldn&amp;#039;t arrange emergency funding by today, resulting in the planned U.S. intervention, the Times said.     AIG is trying to stave off a collapse after its credit ratings were cut yesterday and shares plunged 79 percent since Sept. 11. A failure of New York-based AIG could result in $180 billion of losses to financial institutions, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Hank Calenti.     ``There&amp;#039;s a systemic risk if AIG isn&amp;#039;t saved,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Benoit de Broissia, an equity analyst at Richelieu Finance in Paris, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. Richelieu has about $6.2 billion under management.     AIG is pursuing ``alternatives to increase short-term liquidity, the company said today in a statement.     Former CEO Maurice ``Hank&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Greenberg said the company needs a bridge loan rather than conservatorship, which could put the company under government control.     ``Why would you want to wipe out shareholders when you just need a bridge loan?&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Greenberg said in an interview. ``It doesn&amp;#039;t make any sense.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;     Greenberg, 83, is leading investors considering a proxy fight or buyout to take control of AIG. The group is also considering acquiring subsidiaries or making loans to AIG, the investors said today in a regulatory filing.     Collateral Damage     AIG&amp;#039;s fight to stay afloat is the latest tremor to shake the global financial industry, a day after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. sold itself to Bank of America Corp.     The insurer may be overwhelmed by protection it sold investors on $441 billion of fixed-income investments, including $57.8 billion in securities tied to subprime mortgages. The swaps already forced $25 billion in writedowns over nine months.     The rating cuts may trigger more than $13 billion in collateral calls from debt investors who bought swaps, according to an Aug. 6 filing from New York-based AIG, intensifying pressure on CEO Robert Willumstad to raise cash.     The swaps provided profits when the housing market prospered ``for what has now turned out to be a much greater amount of risk than anybody anticipated,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Willumstad, 63, said during an Aug. 7 conference call.     The $1 trillion-asset company has about $48.7 billion in hard-to-value holdings, and had 116,000 employees as of Dec. 31, compared with 97,000 two years earlier. In addition to selling life insurance and protecting property, AIG owns or manages about $25.7 billion of real estate including residential, industrial and retail properties. The company had private equity and hedge fund holdings of about $30 billion as of June 30.
