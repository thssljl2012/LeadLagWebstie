                            Worried policy holders besiege AIA                                      Wednesday, 17 September 2008   Singapore Democrats                                                     The financial meltdown causing havoc to the US economy has                         inevitably spread to the shores of Singapore.                                                    For the second day today, Singaporeans continued to line up to                         encash their policies at the American International Assurance (AIA)                         at Robinson Road for fear of AIA&amp;#039;s parent body in the US going                         bankrupt.                                                    AIA is Singapore&amp;#039;s subsidiary of the insurance giant American                         International Group (AIG) that has sought and obtained $85 billion                         from the US Federal Reserve to prevent it from going under.                                                    As early as 8 am, a long queue started to build up from the AIA                         Customer Service Centre at 1 Finlayson Green. Within two hours the                         queue expanded to about 500, snaking its way around to Shenton                         Way.                                                    One of them was dispatch rider Hassan bin Maideen, who was in the                         queue to &amp;quot;foreclose&amp;quot; his 25-year policy, five years before its                         maturity.                                                    &amp;quot;There is some doubt about the assurance that our money is safe. We                         don&amp;#039;t know what would happen next,&amp;quot; the 50-year-old Hassan told the                         SDP.                                                    Another was clerk Peter Lam who was not prepared to wait in the                         long queue. Mr Lam, 45, said: &amp;quot;I will take a day off tomorrow and                         come early so that I can get my money back.&amp;quot;                                                    Despite assurance from the Monetary Authority of Singapore that the                         insurance company is backed by liquid funds to meet any demand,                         anxious policy holders were eager to withdraw their money.                                                    From 9.00 am till 5.30 pm AIG staff handed out cheques to customers                         who wanted to withdraw their funds.                                                    A security guard at the entrance said clients who had been given                         queue numbers would be attended to no matter how late it was. He                         said the management expects the same situation tomorrow.                            &amp;amp;nbsp;
