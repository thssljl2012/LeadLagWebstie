  I really think it was a matter of AIG not being able to find anyone to buy off parts of their company, unlike Lehman that was able to sell off parts of their company to other institutions like Barclays.&amp;amp;nbsp; I think Lehman probably has a better chance or reorganizing under Chapter 11 than AIG did, and AIG&amp;#039;s demise would be much more far reaching.&amp;amp;nbsp; I;m not saying if I agree or disagree with how it was all handled -- I haven&amp;#039;t read anough about it yet to make a decision one way or the other.&amp;amp;nbsp; It is a little scary thinking that the feds now control one of the largest insurance companies inthe world -- it was scary enough when they took control of&amp;amp;nbsp;the DC government about 15 years ago, but when DC turned their finances around, the federal control board did relinquish control back to the DC government.&amp;amp;nbsp; Lets hope that the same will hold true for the AIG situation.   Terri -   There can&amp;#039;t be a crisis today, my schedule is already full.
