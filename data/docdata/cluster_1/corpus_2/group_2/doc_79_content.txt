There was a professor on NPR from Maryland today talking about how AIG would affect the rest fo the companies.  I found it very interesting.    The gist of it:  AIG was holding all these mortgage insurance assets that they had valued without any oversight.  These assests are completely unregulated so AIG can put them on their books for whatever they want and they don&amp;#039;t have to keep any cash reserves to back them.    So what happens is they say &amp;amp;quot;We have assets worth $1 billion and they take loans out based on these assets but when the payments on their loans come due and they try to liquidate some of the assets they find that they are only worth half of what they purported them to be.  All of a sudden the imaginary money disappears and they are left upside down.    The problem for other companies is that they are also holding a lot of these types of assets and showing them on their balance sheets.  Now that they are getting examined, these companies are going to have to devalue themselves as well and show major losses.
