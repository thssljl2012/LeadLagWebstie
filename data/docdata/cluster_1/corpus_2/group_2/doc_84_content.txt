 ...The credit crisis has also hit US insurer AIG, which is suffering from a declining share price and facing a possible downgrading of its credit rating.       AIG is being forced to extreme measures, including perhaps selling off subsidiaries to extricate itself from billions of dollars in losses, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition Sunday.       Citing an AIG insider, the respected US business journal said AIG was considering a teleconference with analysts on Monday, at which the process of restructuring would be outlined.       AIG, which has a worldwide presence in the insurance industry, has suffered a 45-per-cent drop in its share price over just a few weeks.       The company lost more than 18 billion dollars in the last three quarters due to enormous write-offs from the ongoing US credit crisis.       http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/s...eculation.html
