I see AIG akin to how the insurance companies suffered after 9/11. The failure of the &amp;amp;quot;investments&amp;amp;quot; they were protecting was just too much for any one company to take on.                      I think the risk with AIG wasn&amp;#039;t that other firms would fail, it&amp;#039;s that the failure of AIG insurance would increase the risk for AIG&amp;#039;s customers.  With their investments no longer insured against loss, a massive selloff would be triggered as people sought to divest themselves.  Additionally, if nobody else stepped up to provide similar insurance, people would be much less likely to invest in the future.  In theory.      On the bright side, the loan is only for 24 months, it&amp;#039;s at prime + 8%, and we have an 80% equity stake in the company, which I seriously hope is sold off a piece at at time and for a hefty profit.      Of course, success here would set a BAD precedent.
