Fears over the health of AIG and its units have intensified after credit agencies lowered their ratings on the insurance giant.      AIG is reportedly working on a survival plan that includes selling some of its most valuable assets and raising more capital.      The MAS declined to comment on AIG and its other Singapore unit, non-life insurer American Home Assurance Singapore.      AIG&amp;#039;s troubles stem from guarantees it wrote on mortgage-linked derivatives that have saddled it with a total of 18 billion US dollars in losses over the past three quarters.      Over the weekend the insurer asked the US Federal Reserve for an unprecedented 40 billion US dollars in short-term financing.       Source: 938Live
