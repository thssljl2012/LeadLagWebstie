         AIG: This is an excerpt from my wife&amp;#039;s email today      &amp;amp;quot;Seesam (This is an Estonian company that she works for when she&amp;#039;s there)is bought out by Austrian company and now they are working with C-Quadrat and Deuche Bank, no more AIG.&amp;amp;quot;      She puts together investment portfolios as well as insurance carriers for them. Oh, and I wouldn&amp;#039;t buy AIG, but I&amp;#039;m long on my wife. She&amp;#039;s a super salesman and manager........ Yank
