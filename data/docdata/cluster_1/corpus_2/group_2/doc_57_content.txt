I found it very interesting.      The gist of it:   AIG was holding all these mortgage insurance assets that they had valued without any oversight.  These assests are completely unregulated so AIG can put them on their books for whatever they want and they don&amp;#039;t have to keep any cash reserves to back them.      So what happens is they say &amp;amp;quot;We have assets worth $1 billion and they take loans out based on these assets but when the payments on their loans come due and they try to liquidate some of the assets they find that they are only worth half of what they purported them to be.  All of a sudden the imaginary money disappears and they are left upside down.      The problem for other companies is that they are also holding a lot of these types of assets and showing them on their balance sheets.  Now that they are getting examined, these companies are going to have to devalue themselves as well and show major losses.                      Thanks for the excellent Clif notes. The reason why the assets were valued incorrectly is based on that everyone underestimated the risk of the mortage loans they were handing out.      Essentially they were looking at Joe Schmoe and saying &amp;amp;quot;There&amp;#039;s only a 2% chance of him defaulting on his mortgage because his 300k house will be worth 400k in a couple of years.&amp;amp;quot; Well, it turns out the insanely rising housing market was a bubble (whoa! who saw that coming?!   ), and all of a sudden that house is only worth 250k and it therefore turns out that Joe Schmoe had a 10% of defaulting... ooops! House of cards tumble.
