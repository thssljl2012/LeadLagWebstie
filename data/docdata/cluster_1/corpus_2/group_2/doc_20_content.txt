AIG was selling insurance to large investment companies who were heavily leveraging themselves in realistate.   These insurance policies took the form of a financial instrument called  derivatives .   The financial institutions purchased these derivatives as a way to limit their exposure to risk in the case something cataclysmic happened to the realistate market.   Like values dropping by 20-30%...     Problem is now everybody who lost their shirts with realistate investments are cashing in on their insurance policy, and AIG is overwhelmed and cash poor.     The sophisticated derivatives which AIG was selling are relatively new vehicles.  AIG fundimentally misunderstood the risk associated with them, and that has lead to the insolvency of the company.     The 85 billion which the Fed has loaned them will go to paying off the derivatives which all these other companies purchased.   If AIG was not loaned money, then all the companies which planned for a softer landing, will not get it, and could themselves become insolvent.
