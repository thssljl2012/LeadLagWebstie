I honestly am curious... If we DON&amp;#039;T bail out AIG, what would happen? Would it affect Wall Street, or would it screw over regular people who have insurance policies with AIG? I don&amp;#039;t know at this point if I support a bailout or not. I guess it depends (to me) on whether NOT bailing them out would hurt average people or rich investors.    Does anyone know anything about this?    Thanks,    Doug
