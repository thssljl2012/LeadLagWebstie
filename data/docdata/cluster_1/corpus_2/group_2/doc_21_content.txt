 Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are not written against mortgages, they&amp;#039;re written against the debt issuers.      There are CDS against Lehmn Brothers, Fannie, Freddie, AIG, even municipal bonds.      In my previous post when I said some CDOs have their ratings beause they purchased insurance, they essentially would have arranged a CDS for the pool as a whole rather than the individual mortgages.  And to figure out how to insure the pool they look at all the different grades of quality within the pool to gauge how cash flow would change under different states of the world (that&amp;#039;s also how the banks have been pricing their CDOs.. for example Citigroup has baked in aggregate housing price declines of 30&amp;amp;#37;, they&amp;#039;ve also factored in higher defaults but they haven&amp;#039;t disclosed all the intricate details.      CDS are written by AIG and other insurance companies.      And frankly not every CDS will have to be paid out so when people fret about the capital of the institutions who wrote CDS, they really should be worrying only about the ones that are at risk rather than worrying every single one will default.  Keep in mind bankruptcy does not necessaily mean default.
