No it will not. AIG Life Insurance is a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG, Corp. By law the money in their Life Insurance and Annuity portfolios must be kept seperate from other company money. Insurance regulations also stipulate that a company keep $1 in cash reserves for ever $1 of Death Benefit. Most insurance companies have $1.1-$1.5 for ever dollar of DB.      In other words, your insurance should be fine, but having a review would never hurt, especially if you have term insurance.
