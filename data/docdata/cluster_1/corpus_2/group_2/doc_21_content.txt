    I&amp;#039;ve had AIG  auto  insurance coverage for many years. Very low rates because they don&amp;#039;t have local offices with overhead. But they&amp;#039;ve had great networking support when I filed a claim, and they factor&amp;amp;nbsp;the use and mileage&amp;amp;nbsp;of each vehicle in their rates.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   When I asked online for a  home  insurance quote, they referred me to the hardest-working&amp;amp;nbsp;local agent I&amp;#039;ve ever met, who lowered my&amp;amp;nbsp;homeowner&amp;#039;s insurance cost by about 30%. (Country Insurance, not Country Wide).   &amp;amp;nbsp;   Looks like their managers got caught up in the leveraged debt rackets, because their insurance business, per se, is good. I believe Warren Buffet started his investing via insurance funds, because Nebraska state law allows insurance companies to do so. He, however, has been known as a &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; investor who eschews financial junk instruments.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   --Max
