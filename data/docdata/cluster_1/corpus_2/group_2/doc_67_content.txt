  Government announces $85 billion loan to save AIG      16 Sept.`08  WASHINGTON - For the second time this month, the U.S. government put taxpayer money on the hook to rescue a private financial company, saying the failure of the huge insurer American International Group Inc. would further disrupt markets and threaten the already fragile economy.                  Quote:                  The Federal Reserve said Tuesday it would provide up to $85 billion in an emergency, two-year loan to rescue AIG, which teetered on the edge of failure because of stresses caused by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and the credit crunch that ensued. In return, the government will get a 79.9 percent stake in AIG and the right to remove senior management.        The move was similar to government&amp;#039;s seizure on Sept. 7 of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, where the Treasury Department said it was prepared to put up as much as $100 billion over time in each of the companies if needed to keep them from going broke. Both moves were bound to raise questions about the use of taxpayer money to bail out private firms.        The Fed said it determined that a disorderly failure of AIG could hurt the already delicate financial markets and the economy. Although little known off Wall Street, AIG does business with almost every financial institution in the world and insures $88 billion worth of assets including mortgages and corporate loans.  Its failure could also &amp;amp;quot;lead to substantially higher borrowing costs, reduced household wealth and materially weaker economic performance,&amp;amp;quot; the Fed said in a statement.        The decision to help AIG reversed the government&amp;#039;s stance over the weekend, when it refused to use taxpayer money to bail out Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Lehman, which filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, collapsed under the weight of mounting losses related to its real estate holdings.  The White House said it backed the Fed&amp;#039;s decision Tuesday.

The explanation: AIG was deemed too huge (its assets top $1 trillion), too global, and too interconnected to fail.                  Quote:                  That, and the fact that unlike with Lehman  where the possibility of failure was openly discussed for months and to a certain extent planned for  federal officials and market participants don&amp;#039;t seem to have really focused on AIG&amp;#039;s problems until this week. As with all U.S. insurers, the company is regulated not by the Feds but by a state regulator, in this case New York insurance superintendent Eric Dinallo. Plus, it was awfully hard for outsiders  and even insiders  to understand the gravity of the company&amp;#039;s problems. &amp;amp;quot;You can read through every financial statement in the world and have absolutely no clue as to the risks they are taking,&amp;amp;quot; says Leo Tilman, a former Bear Stearns strategist who now runs the advisory firm L.M.Tilman &amp;amp;amp; Co.        The particular risks that brought the company to the brink of bankruptcy seem to lie not with its core insurance businesses but with derivatives-trading subsidiary AIG Financial Products. AIG FP, as it&amp;#039;s called, merits a mere paragraph in the nine-page description of the company&amp;#039;s businesses in its most recent annual report. But it&amp;#039;s a huge player in the new and mysterious business of credit default swaps, derivative securities that allow banks, hedge funds and other financial players to insure against loans gone bad.        AIG generally sells credit default swaps, thus promising to insure others against defaults. It&amp;#039;s a great business when defaults are low; when they rise it can turn toxic. AIG FP lost more than $10 billion in 2007, and $14.7 billion in the first six months of this year. That, along with losses in other investment portfolios, have cut deeply into the parent company&amp;#039;s capital reserves. The credit default swap contracts decree that if AIG&amp;#039;s credit rating drops below a certain level it has to fork over $13 billion in collateral to the buyers of the swaps. Monday night, because of the losses at AIG FP and in the AIG&amp;#039;s investment portfolios, Moody&amp;#039;s and S&amp;amp;amp;P cut the company&amp;#039;s ratings. After that the consensus was that the company could only survive another day or two.
