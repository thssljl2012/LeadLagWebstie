 FWIW -      The World&amp;#039;s largest insurance company that manages/guarantees pensions and annuities is American International Group (AIG).      Currently they are in a cashflow crunch/meltdown.      Specifically, because their credit worthiness of their assets have been cut by S&amp;amp;amp;P and Moody&amp;#039;s (large derivative exposure/pending write-offs), AIG needs an IMMEDIATE cash infusion, or it will default on its obligations, thus having to declare bankruptcy.      In short, if AIG doesn&amp;#039;t get bailed out, this week, your pension or annuity may not get paid.  And the amount of cash infusion in question approaches $100.0B.      In summary, this crisis has immediate ramifications and consequencies to many MOA members.      JMHO      J.K.         P.S.
