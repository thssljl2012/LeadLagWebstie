                               unlike AIG, SF is a mutual company.  that doesn&amp;#039;t mean they don&amp;#039;t/won&amp;#039;t have problems.  mutual carriers have a bit more difficulty raising capital, so if they got into trouble they would face challenges different from AIG and other stock carriers.    The doctor is in. Five cents please.
