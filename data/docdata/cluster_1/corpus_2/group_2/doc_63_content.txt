Fed                  By   Robert Daniel  , MarketWatch    Last update: 2:38 a.m. EDT Sept. 24, 2008                             TEL AVIV (MarketWatch) -- American International Group Inc. definitively agreed to take a two-year $85 billion revolving-credit facility from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.               &amp;quot;AIG made an exhaustive effort to address its liquidity needs through private-sector financing but was unable to do so in the current environment,&amp;quot; chairman and chief executive Edward M. Liddy said in a statement late on Tuesday.     &amp;quot;This facility was the company&amp;#039;s best alternative.&amp;quot;     AIG is one of the major financial firms whose difficulties or failures prompted the U.S. government to create a $700 billion financial-market rescue.     The announcement of the new credit line for AIG came as the Associated Press was reporting that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into potential fraud at mortgage giants Fannie Mae   (  FNM      )  and Freddie Mac,   (  FRE      )  the investment bank Lehman Brothers   (  LEHMQ      )  and at AIG.   Read the article.       On Sept. 16, the government took control of AIG, agreeing to lend the firm $85 billion in return for a 79.9% equity interest.     And indeed, as part of the credit line, AIG said on Tuesday it will issue convertible preferred stock to a trust that will hold the stock on behalf of the U.S. Treasury.     AIG will pay dividends on the preferred stock. The payouts will be about 79.9% of the total dividends AIG pays, the company said. And it will vote with the common stock on all matters, with 79.9% of the total voting power.     The New York insurance giant   (  AIG      )  said interest on the credit line will be based on the three-month London interbank-offered rate, plus 8.5%.     The company will pay a commitment fee on the credit line of 2% of the facility on the closing date, AIG said. And AIG will pay a commitment fee of 8.5% a year on the amount it does not draw down. The interest and fees will be payable by increasing the balance outstanding, AIG said.     AIG said it is required to repay the facility from, among other things, funds from asset sales and from issuance of debt or equity.     AIG is &amp;quot;already developing a plan to sell assets, repay the facility and emerge as a smaller but profitable company,&amp;quot; Liddy said. &amp;quot;Importantly, AIG&amp;#039;s insurance subsidiaries remain strong, liquid and well-capitalized.&amp;quot;     These mandatory repayments will permanently reduce the amount available to AIG under the credit line.     To secure the credit line, AIG will pledge the capital stock and assets of certain subsidiaries, with some exclusions. Those include certain property that the company can&amp;#039;t pledge due to the terms of its debt. Also excluded are assets of regulated and foreign subsidiaries and assets of special-purpose vehicles, AIG said.     AIG can borrow under the facility so long as the New York Fed is &amp;quot;reasonably satisfied with, among other things, AIG&amp;#039;s corporate governance,&amp;quot; the company said.     Other conditions include AIG maintaining a certain amount of liquidity and the trust holding the preferred stock for the Treasury being satisfied with the makeup of AIG&amp;#039;s board.
