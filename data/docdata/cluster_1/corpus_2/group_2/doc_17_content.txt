If AIG defaults, you own a well capitalized solid insurance company.  Unlike other corporate giants who have gone down the tubes, this is not a situation where a few bigwigs parachuted themselves to wealth in Rio while the folks lost their life savings. The employees have been kept fully apprised of developments all the way back to Spitzer&amp;#039;s prosecution of Greenburg. There is no hanky panky here, thus no need for outrage.                      Can&amp;#039;t lose?      Who is &amp;amp;quot;you own&amp;amp;quot;?  How will a taxpayer ever see the direct benefit?  Where is the GOVT getting this money to borrow?      Is it bad that this company is in the ****ter, YES.  Will it effect alot of people, YES.  Will it turn the economy down, YES.  If you can&amp;#039;t stand the heat get out the damn kitchen.
