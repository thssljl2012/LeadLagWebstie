Their assets were over a trillion dollars.  They were illiquid but not insolvent.      Let me give you an example.  Let me posit a scenario where my net worth is $1 million dollars composed of various assets such as my home, equipment, whatever.  I&amp;#039;m a millionaire -- right?  We can agree on that.      Second part:  But I only have a nominal amount of  money in cash in which to pay my current on-going obligations such as the mortgage on my home or whatever.  The bank still expects me to pay for my mortgage payment do they not?  Only I don&amp;#039;t have the money to pay for it.  I&amp;#039;m in the same boat as any other debtor who can&amp;#039;t pony up the money to pay my house payment am I not.    I&amp;#039;m not insolvent.  I&amp;#039;m merely illiquid without sufficient cash assets to meet my on-going obligations.    What part of that do you disagree with?
