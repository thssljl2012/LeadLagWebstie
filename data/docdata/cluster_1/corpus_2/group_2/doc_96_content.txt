There is a big moose that has just stepped in and made a massive secured loan. The paper of the subs will get an upgrade on the knowledge that they will not file and will probably be sold to stronger hands, But AIG itself? Sorry.&amp;quot;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;    I&amp;#039;m not sure what you&amp;#039;re talking about. If you take the agencies at their word, the downgrade was due to a lack of liquidity. That&amp;#039;s now been fixed, since they have an $85b credit line. Note the last sentence regarding what they believe is the &amp;quot;main reason&amp;quot; for the downgrade.     6:50AM American Intl ratings lowered and kept on CreditWatch Negative at S&amp;amp;P (AIG) 4.76 : S&amp;amp;P lowered its long-term counterparty rating on American International Group to &amp;#039;A-&amp;#039; from &amp;#039;AA-&amp;#039; and its short-term counterparty credit rating on AIG to &amp;#039;A-2&amp;#039; from &amp;#039;A-1+&amp;#039;. Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s also said that it lowered its counterparty credit and financial strength ratings on most of AIG&amp;#039;s insurance operating subsidiaries to &amp;#039;A+&amp;#039; from &amp;#039;AA+&amp;#039;. All of these ratings remain on CreditWatch with negative implications, where they were placed on Sept. 12, 2008. &amp;quot;The main reason for the rating actions is the combination of reduced flexibility in meeting additional collateral needs and concerns over increasing residential mortgage-related losses.&amp;quot;       thread start
