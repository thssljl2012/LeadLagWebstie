Why are people complaining?  Most banks have taken insurance with AIG and when they desperately need money they go to AIG. Now a lot of banks are going to AIG, this means that AIG is going bankrupt. Government puts money into AIG.  If the government didn&amp;#039;t do that then most major banks would go bankrupt and cause an UNREAL financial disaster.
