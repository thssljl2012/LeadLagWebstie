 As an Agent that sells AIG policies, the company still has money set aside in the claim account to pay claims.  As a New York based company it still maintains New York Solvency Standards. They also have enough collateral to post if they should need to pay claims.      I would think that you should be fine.  I&amp;#039;m sure some other company will come and buy them out or the Government will help them out lol.
