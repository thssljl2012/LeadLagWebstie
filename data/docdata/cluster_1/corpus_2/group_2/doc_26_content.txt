You have no grasp of why the AIG bailout was needed. It wasnt because a lot of consumers would have lost their homeowners policies or life insurance. If AIG had gone under, those profitable parts of AIGs business portfolio would have been scarfed up by eager third parties in one day. To give you (not to mention Senator Obama) the Readers Digest version of things, the parts of AIG that write consumer policies are essentially a separate company from the part thats in trouble. The reasons for this are too boring to get into, but it has a lot to do with state regulatory guidelines that cover consumer insurance policies. If AIG was allowed to blow-up, America and the whole financial world would be in chaos.     You are correct. However I have a news flash for you: America is already in a state of chaos. The financial industry is being nationalized. Illegitimate wars in two foreign countries, and a prez and VP elect who are threatening more war...against Russia to boot. Dollar not doing so great over the last several years. The big three in Detroit on the verge of collapse. Housing industry in a freefall. Unemployment on the rise.  We passed the point of &amp;amp;quot;would be in chaos&amp;amp;quot; a long time ago.
