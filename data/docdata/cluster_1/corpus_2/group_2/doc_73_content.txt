Galing kasi ng AIG...      Not only did they invest in mortgage-backed securities (dyan napunta ang mga insurance premiums ng AIG customers)...      they sold insurance protecting mortgage-backed securities against default. (syempre, insurance company ang AIG,  they sell insurance hehe)      Now that those mortgage-backed securities are toilet paper,  AIG saw a lot of its assets evaporate...      And since they insure against defaults,  they have to pay out a lot of money coz those securities are defaulting all over the place.      kaya eto ang AIG ngayon... kulang sa pera...      naglilimos... nagbebenta ng ari-arian...      ano kaya effect nito sa Philam Insurance?      hmmmm
