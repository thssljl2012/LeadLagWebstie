  Feds will be paid back with the sale of the crown jewel of AIG, its insurance empire then other assets if needed. This is an estimated 900 billion to a trillion dollar financial empire.The feds just got about 700 billion for its 80 billion investment which it will get back. Great purchase for the Feds.By the way the Feds had to rescue wallstreet from its collapse. If this did not happen you would be feeling this event for the next 3 or 4 months with a domino collapse of about 1/3 the financial sector. If you think that the Feds got had in this deal, why didnt the shares of AIG increase in value today. The reason is because the shares are worth about 20%nowof the total assets, the other 80% is held by the Feds,about $2 to $3. a share.
