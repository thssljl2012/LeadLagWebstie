Banks sell of the mortgages to other banks and investment firms like bear sterns and lehman create investment funds  based off bundled mortgages . Because of the way the investment firms bundled the mortgages, the collapse of home prices, and increase in foreclosures, AIG got screwed. All the federal government did here was lend AIG the money because AIG has the assets to sell off to pay back the loan and the high interest that comes along with it. This loan is a short term cost for the tax payers because within two years all the money will be payed back plus interest.                      ..bundled mortgages that had AAA ratings because of lax oversight and murky information.  The core problem is the same; the only silver lining is that AIG has some worthwhile assets that its new owners (the US tax payers) can sell off.  Hopefully we&amp;#039;ll break even, and AIG will come out better for the experience.      Whether or not we get our money back &amp;amp;quot;plus interest&amp;amp;quot; within two years, or ever, is still yet to be determined.
