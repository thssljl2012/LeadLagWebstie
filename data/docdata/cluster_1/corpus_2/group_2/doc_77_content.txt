 SINGAPORE: AIA Singapore&amp;#039;s top man, the executive vice-president and general manager, Mark O&amp;#039;Dell has resigned from the company and has taken leave of absence with immediate effect.       It&amp;#039;s believed he&amp;#039;s joining a rival insurer overseas, and for someone of his rank, it explains the immediate departure.       In a statement released on Thursday, AIA said that his decision to leave the company is not related to the recent developments at American International Group (AIG). It was a personal decision that he had been planning for some time.       Mr O&amp;#039;Dell is believed to be the longest-serving foreign general manager here.       Mr Kenneth Juneau, executive vice president &amp;amp;amp; senior regional life executive of AIA&amp;#039;s regional office, will assume leadership responsibilities with effect from September 19, 2008 in the interim until a statement is made on the new general manager for AIA Singapore.       Mr Juneau, an AIA veteran, has more than 30 years experience in the insurance industry.       AIG announced on 16 September 2008 that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is providing a two-year, US$85 billion secured revolving credit facility to AIG that will ensure that the company can meet its liquidity needs.       In response, Singapore&amp;#039;s Central Bank said its regulatory oversight of AIA and all insurers in Singapore is rigorous.       And it is satisfied with the ability of the company to carry on business as usual and to meet new demands even when there are any changes in management.       The Monetary Authority of Singapore reiterates that AIA has sufficient assets in its insurance funds to meet its liabilities to policyholders.       It adds that policyholders should not act hastily to terminate their insurance policies as they may suffer losses from the premature termination and lose the insurance protection they may need.       Meanwhile, anxious policyholders lined up outside the Singapore offices of global insurance giant American International Group (AIG) Thursday, despite the US government&amp;#039;s bailout of the firm.       AIA said less than 0.1 per cent or under 2500 policies have been surrendered so far. AIA has about 2.5 million policies in force in Singapore. - CNA/vm       ======================================      wow siao liao.....terminate policy or not to.
