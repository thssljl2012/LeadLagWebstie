     Gecko - You can&amp;#039;t really look at it that way as overpaying by $74 billion.  If AIG goes down it will take A LOT of commercial and investment banks, S&amp;amp;amp;Ls, mortgage companies, other insurance companies, and maybe even a reinsurance company or two down with it.  Not to mention leaving a lot of insureds and contract bond obligees twisting in the wind along with a bunch of boomers and retirees that have annuities through AIG (those are not FDIC insured).   I saw a model from Berkshire Hathaway (they own a ton of insurance companies and have economic modeling capabilities that are probably better than anyone else including the Fed ) that estimated a total direct losses to our economy of somewhere north of $400 billion, and that did not include the actual market value of AIG itself.  Plus imagine what the indirect costs would be when you include the cost of having a bunch more people out of work, a bunch more losing health insurance coverage, even more folks who can&amp;#039;t make their mortgage payments, etc.   AIG is much more than just another insurance company, they are a cornerstone in the credit risk spreading infrastructure of our economy without which the financial service and  insurance service portions of our economy could not function.     As much as I am not a fan of Bush&amp;#039;s administration and would like to pillory him on this too, they did the right thing.  AIG can go down, but it can not be allowed to go down in an unorganized way overnight.  Pretty much whatever the cost is in proping AIG up long enough for the market to redistribute the credit risks AIG has been supporting is a bargain in the long and short run.  If the Fed didn&amp;#039;t step in, within 6 months many people who have not even heard of AIG would be screwed.                        There are no stronger bonds than those forged in the face of adversity (R.E.
