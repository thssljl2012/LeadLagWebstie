 I think people complaining about bailing out billionaires are missing the point.  Take a look at the AIG loan.  The Fed&amp;#039;s loan (not a &amp;#039;bailout&amp;#039;) prevented the bankruptcy of AIG.  It was a wise move. Allowing AIG to fail would have had ruinous consequences for the US as well as world economies.      AIG is the largest insurer on the planet, with assets of over $1 TRILLION.  It operates in 130 countries, has 116,000 employees, is so integral to the functioning of global financial markets that to allow its demise would have been a serious mistake.      It was not a giveaway.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Fed will provide a 2-year loan at a rate of 11.5 percent (not bad), and has acquired 79.9 percent of AIG&amp;#039;s stock, and has fired its executive suite.      2 points about AIG:       - The huge losses AIG sustained came from derivative investments, not from its core insurance operations, which remain profitable and well-capitalized.        - AIG&amp;#039;s problem is one of liquidity, not solvency. Their insurance companies&amp;#039; assets are more than enough to meet its obligations to not only the Fed, but  their policyholders and other creditors.      When Nancy Pelosi spouts off for the cameras about this loan being a waste of money, she makes herself look like a fool when you look at the facts.
