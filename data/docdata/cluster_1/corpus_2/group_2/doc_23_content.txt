          Is the answer different for term vs whole life?   I believe they are. As GADawg commented,  If the surplus is inadequate to pay for future claims, all states have a life insurance guaranty fund, like FDIC insurance, that will pay insurance benefits for insolvent insurers. The limit varies by state, but most states will honor up to a $300k life insurance benefit.  I believe the $300,000 coverage, here in Illinois, is for death benefits, as he commented is pretty common. I *think* the limit of insurance insolvency fund coverage for cash surrender value (also for Annuities, and Health Insurance policy benefits) is $100,000, at least in Illinois:   http://www.kaplanfinancial.com/kfs/assets/Pdf/Test-Alerts-In...    http://www.bestcashcow.com/all/all/sam_cass/what-happens-to-...   You can check with your State Department of Insurance for more specifics in your State.  The possibility of AIG going under is VERY scary, at least to me, and shouldn&amp;#039;t be taken lightly - Your questions are very appropriate.   Bob
