You&amp;#039;re absolutely correct, Fiorenza. Locally, it may have implications for Atlantic Station, but more worrying is what may be the broader impact within the capital markets.      ----       AIG shares slump, says &amp;#039;everything on the table&amp;#039;    Insurer may sell Transatlantic stake, other businesses to raise capital   By MarketWatch      (MarketWatch) -- Insurance giant American International Group, beset by a record stock slump and a possible cut from ratings agency Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s, said Friday it was reviewing its businesses and that &amp;amp;quot;everything was on the table,&amp;amp;quot; suggesting it might sell assets to raise capital and avoid a crippling downgrade. The company had been preparing for a major reorganization announcement on Sept. 25, but on Friday the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site that the company may hold a conference call for analysts on Monday during which it could announce asset sales.      AIG shares slumped a record 31% Friday on concern the world&amp;#039;s largest insurer may be downgraded by ratings agencies, triggering billions of dollars in new capital needs.   Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s put AIG&amp;#039;s ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications, suggesting the agency may downgrade the insurer in the future.      &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re reviewing everything,&amp;amp;quot; Nicholas Ashooh, an AIG spokesman, said. &amp;amp;quot;Everything&amp;#039;s on the table.&amp;amp;quot;       Spreads on AIG (AIG) credit default swaps widened by 191 basis points to 883 on Friday, according to Credit Default Research. That&amp;#039;s wider than spreads on CDS of Lehman Brothers (LEH), which is rushing to sell itself to salvage its business. CDS are a common type of derivative contract that pay out in the event of default. When the difference, or spread, between rates on these contracts and rates on U.S. Treasury bonds increases, that suggests investors are more worried about a potential default.      &amp;amp;quot;While most of us are discussing the future of Lehman and its impact on the broader market, what we should be of more worried about is the action in AIG,&amp;amp;quot; Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. AIG has been hit hard by the housing crisis and credit crunch because the insurer&amp;#039;s derivatives unit sold guarantees on mortgage-related securities known as collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, using credit default swaps.      As house prices fall and the credit crunch deepens, the market value of these CDO exposures is dropping, forcing AIG to report big write-downs. AIG reported a quarterly net loss of more than $5 billion in August as it wrote down these exposures more and suffered impairments on some of its mortgage-related investments. Investors and analysts are now worried that AIG could be downgraded again by ratings agencies. If that happens, the insurer&amp;#039;s derivatives unit would have to post billions of dollars in extra collateral to support contracts with trading counterparties. That, in turn, has sparked concerns that the company will need to raise more capital.      If AIG&amp;#039;s long-term senior debt ratings are cut to A1 by Moody&amp;#039;s Investors Service and A+ by Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s, counterparties would be able to demand roughly $13.3 billion in extra collateral, the insurer estimated in its latest quarterly regulatory filing. The company&amp;#039;s ratings are currently one notch above that. With AIG shares slumping, it may be more difficult for the company to sell new shares to raise all the capital it may. Instead, the company may be able to sell some of its businesses or unwind some of its derivative-based guarantees, Citigroup&amp;#039;s Shanker wrote.      AIG has several businesses that can be sold to raise capital, Citigroup&amp;#039;s Shanker explained. Some of these haven&amp;#039;t been hit as hard by the credit crunch, making them easier to sell, he added. AIG&amp;#039;s majority stake in Transatlantic is a likely candidate for sale. Other such businesses include the insurer&amp;#039;s big aircraft leasing unit ILFC, the VALIC and SunAmerica U.S. variable annuity units and its stake in the People&amp;#039;s Insurance Company of China, Shanker said. AIG&amp;#039;s personal lines insurance businesses, including 21st Century, could also be sold, the analyst said. The company&amp;#039;s consumer finance unit, American General Finance, could also be sold, but that has been affected more by the credit crunch, so any deal may happen under &amp;amp;quot;fire-sale&amp;amp;quot; conditions, Shanker added.      &amp;amp;quot;A value of no less than $20 billion could be realized upon sale of these assets even under extreme duress,&amp;amp;quot; the analyst wrote. &amp;amp;quot;We believe the value of these businesses is significantly higher.&amp;amp;quot;
