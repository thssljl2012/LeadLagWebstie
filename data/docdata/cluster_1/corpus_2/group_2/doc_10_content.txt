 AIG Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Commentary from CSFB       Fed Lifeline for AIG to Result in Auction of            Many (if not all) Businesses          &amp;amp;#9632;        Last night after the close, the Federal Reserve announced that it was        lending up to $85 billion to AIG, due mainly to the fact that the Federal        Reserve Board determined that a disorderly failure of AIG would create too        much turmoil to the global financial markets.        &amp;amp;#9632;        According to the Fed press release, the loan will facilitate a process under        which AIG will sell certain of its businesses in an orderly manner, with the        least possible disruption to the overall economy. The facility has a 2 year        term, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 850 bps, its collateralized by all of AIGs        assets, and the loan is expected to be repaid from the proceeds of the sale        of the firms assets. Also, in exchange for providing the loan, the   U.S.          government will also receive an 80% equity interest in AIG and has the right        to veto the payment of dividends to common and preferred shareholders. It        is also expected that former Allstate CEO Ed Liddy will be named CEO of        AIG, replacing Bob Willumstad.        &amp;amp;#9632;        This announcement raises several questions and/or observations specific to        AIG:        &amp;amp;#9632;          1.     The size of the credit facility suggests that the liquidity/capital needs at        AIG may be substantially greater than we had estimated, implying that a        considerable amount of the total value of AIGs businesses may not go to        current debt or equity holders, but rather to repay the Feds term loan,        &amp;amp;#9632;     2    . The 11.3% interest rate of the term loan (if the entire facility is tapped), would shave        about $2.00 per share off of EPS (before considering dilution from the Feds new 80%        stake), or about 50-60% of our prior EPS estimate. Combining the dilutive effects of        the high cost debt plus the governments 80% stake in the equity would leave us with        about 90% pro forma dilution for common shareholders (or about 30 to 40 cents in        annual EPS).        &amp;amp;#9632;     3.     The Feds comment that AIG will pay off the $85 billion loan from proceeds from the        sale of businesses, suggests that the majority of the company may be sold off in        pieces. This is a staggering development, that the formerly largest global insurance        company will potentially be unwound through a 1 to 2 year auction process.        &amp;amp;#9632;     4.     What will the rating agency reaction be with the company operating with better        liquidity but dramatically higher financial leverage assuming that it taps a large portion        of the term facility? Both Moodys and S&amp;amp;amp;P have the senior debt rated in the single A        range, but there clearly is still risk that debt holders may not be made whole as the        company sells businesses and pays down debt.        &amp;amp;#9632;     5.     A fairly swift execution of sales of businesses will be important to avoid substantial        erosion of franchise value, since customer lapse rates and withdrawals should remain        elevated following the publicized difficulties at the company, and 6. Book value is likely        to be hit hard by both bigger asset impairments and DAC charges associated with AIG        likely moving to liquidation based valuation methodologies vs. the prior going concern        asset valuations.        &amp;amp;#9632;   With all of this in mind, our $3 price target for AIG common equity still seems        reasonable though more of a best case scenario for the equity value in our view, if AIG        does in fact look to sell off most or all of its businesses. With pro-forma EPS likely 30-        40 cents, and pro-forma tangible book value in a $3 to $4 range, we would expect the        stock to trade in a $1 to $4 range, toward the lower end if the debt fails to stage a        significant rally, and toward the upper end if the debt and preferreds rally.        &amp;amp;#9632;   In terms of implications for the insurance industry, there will be plenty of high quality        businesses for sale, notably international life insurance, foreign general, and the        domestic retirement business (VALIC). We suspect that some of the big foreign        players (Chinese, Canadian, European, and Australian insurers) may be interested        buyers along with the usual large cap suspects domestically on both the life and P&amp;amp;amp;C        sides.        &amp;amp;#9632;   This obviously has the potential to improve the competitive landscape in several        markets, notably in commercial P&amp;amp;amp;C, several foreign life insurance markets (including          Japan    ), and domestic life insurance, where AIG has been among the largest players        for years. While this has positive intermediate term implications for the industry, it also        has some negative near term implications in that a de-risking of AIGs balance sheet        over the next few quarters would likely to weigh on structured fixed income asset        valuations, leading to further potential negative marks and impairments.
