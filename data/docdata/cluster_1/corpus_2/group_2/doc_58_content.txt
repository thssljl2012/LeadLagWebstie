    Indy11:      Random Guy:  Anyway states have regulators and specialized accountants who act in a manner similar to bank examiners. AIG is presumedly being monitored by the New York insurance department.  You might miss it in the news, but it was the governor of New York that allowed AIG to tap the cash of its subsidiaries, not the Feds.  This is a HIGHLY unusual move, i.e. allowing a parent to tap into the reserves of their subsidiary insurance companies. Generally regulators like to see a &amp;quot;wall&amp;quot; between the two, to keep shinanegans from happening.   The AIG subsidiaries, the insurance company arms, actually are find. But the holding company has &amp;quot;liquidity&amp;quot; problems.  And it seems that it wasn&amp;#039;t a bridge loan. It was a stock swap. AIG holding company swapped capital that was less liquid for more liquid stocks held by the subsidiaries to the tune of $20Bn.  That still left them $20Bn shy of what they need.  I don&amp;#039;t think the insurance sector can afford to lose the underwriting capacity that AIG as a whole represents. Seems to me that if the holding company goes under the subsidiaries will be bought up by other insurers ... at least that&amp;#039;s what I would hope would happen. Otherwise, there will be a lot of chaos.    There is no doubt the subsidiaries would be bought out.  That happens on a daily basis.  Liberty Mutual just recently bought SafeCO.  Allstate bought Encompass and Deerbrook.  What companies should do to save money is cut tv and radio advertising, use independent agents as their marketing.  That saves a shit load of money.
