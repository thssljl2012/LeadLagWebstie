The whole financial meltdown is so huge no one can be sure of anything. I have 8 policies myself with AIA, one life and one endowment for myself, wife and my two kids. For sure, it&amp;#039;s worrying. MAS and AIA both say AIA has enough money to cover all policies but personally, I am not so confident. Unfortunately we are in a situation where if we surrender now, our surrender value may be so little it is not worth it at all. The risk is there. We have to gauge it ourselves.
