I do not think that AIG had any problems with its insurance business.  They had a wonderfully profitable operation in Asia (and China).  Their property and annuity business is very profitable in the U.S. (insuring 1 of 8 homes in CA).  They insure boats, jets, work comp...  It&amp;#039;s the crown jewel of their business.      The insurance business is the collateral for the $85B government loan (at 8.5% above Libor).  They also had to give the government 80% of the equity ownership via EPNs (equity participation notes).  That is a massive dilution to current shareholders.      I am sure Berkshire would love to take some of that insurance business (except the work comp which they don&amp;#039;t like).      What sent AIG down the toilet was their credit-default swap business.  They were selling paper against default on corporate debt and mortgage securities.  The write downs on these toxic weapons of mass destruction caused their credit rating to fall which triggered clauses that required more collateral to back the swaps.      It was a failure of risk management on top of a highly leveraged financial position.      You have to go all the way to p.224 to find that AIG owned $190B in debt.  I don&amp;#039;t think anyone knew how much liability was involved with those swaps (certainly not most of the 75-year old board members).  I&amp;#039;ve never bought Citigroup as its balance sheet was too hard to understand; AIG was even more complicated.  Just ignore the glossy photos and management&amp;#039;s poor summary and go straight to the audited shit and tell me what was going on within this hellhole of stockholder destruction.    http://www.ezodproxy.com/AIG/2008/AR...AIG_AR2007.pdf
