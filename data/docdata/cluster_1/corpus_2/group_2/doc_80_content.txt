   Thailand-based AIA says its financial position remains strong            BANGKOK, Sept 17 (TNA) - American  International Assurance (AIA) Thailand said Wednesday although its parent company in the United States, American Insurance Group (AIG), is facing a financial crunch, the AIA office in the kingdom still enjoys strong financial position,  according to Thomas James White, AIA Thailand&amp;#039;s executive vice president and general manager.      US financial institutions and government agencies have already extended loans amounting to US$85 billion with an aim to boost liquidity of AIG, the US parent of AIA, Mr. White indicated.      AIA in Thailand is a subsidiary of AIA in Hong Kong and has been in business 70 years, he said. Currently, there are more than 4.8 million policyholders in Thailand and if the number of policy holders on accident and health is added then the grand total of policyholders would be over 5.8 million.      Business growth of the company here is over 10 per cent annually, he said, adding that his company would from Wednesday notify its client base by letter clarifying the real situation in order to create confidence among its customers.      Agents of AIA Thailand will also explain the situation to customers, said Mr. White. AIA Thailand has accumulated profits amounting over Bt79 billion, 10 times more than requirements specified by Thailand&amp;#039;s Office of Insurance Commission (OIC). Its reserves are over Bt280 billion while its total assets exceed Bt380 billion, said  Mr. White.       He said AIA Thailand sought permission from the OIC a long time ago to repatriate a total of Bt10 billion to the parent company with money amounting Bt1 billion would be sent monthly. The cash repatriation has nothing to do with boosting liquidity of the parent firm, Mr. White said. (TNA)
