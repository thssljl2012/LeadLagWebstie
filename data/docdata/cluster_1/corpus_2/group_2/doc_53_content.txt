 WAMU is small fish compared to what went down tonight with Moody&amp;#039;s downgrading AIG (American Insurance Group) from AA3 to A2.  Capital is going to have to be raised FAST.  Its going to be interesting to see what the government does with this after just letting Lehman fail.        Guys with money in WAMU, you might be worried, but you will get your money rest assured.  The FDIC is lower than normal on funds right now, but they have a credit line with the US Treasury and its a government sponsored entity so they will get you your money.
