       AIG Commercial Insurance,including Lexington Insurance,American Home Insurance,National Union, has statutory surplus of $26.7 billion and invested assets over $70 billion. The capital is protected by regulators. AIG Commercial Insurance is wholly owned by AIG. Nothing can be ruled out these days but I doubt AIG needs to file for bankruptcy.
