 BAK Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              XFP Present Value (also thanks UGA and Al_Tnnr)   Putting aside the debate about whether XFP pays (I think they do as the junior sub debt of the insurance sub that holds 20% of AIG&amp;#039;s assets), here&amp;#039;s what XFP might be worth.    Assuming they suspend the interest payments for the next 10 semi-annual periods starting with the 12/1/2008 period, here is what a 32.5 year $1.53125 annual cash flow (12/1/2045 maturity) is worth starting 5 years from now at various discount rates.    5% $19.08  8% $11.96  10% $9.08    Thanks to ugadawg and Al_Tnnr for pointing XFP out. We&amp;#039;ll see how they do tomorrow, but in any case, I appreciate the idea sharing.
