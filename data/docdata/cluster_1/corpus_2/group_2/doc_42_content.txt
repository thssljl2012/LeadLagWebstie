          AIG insures debt in some form or another of almost every major financial player and country in the world. What do you suppose would happen if AIG fails and the insurance backing that debt fails? When institutions start calling the debt on other institutions because its not backed anymore and their clients/depositiors start panicking and these institutions start failing like a big row of dominoes? Because that was about to start happening.   Indeed. It was so close to the edge that on Monday morning certain of AIG&amp;#039;s insurance units had no access to commercial paper. They couldn&amp;#039;t fund their new business book and had to temporarily suspend writing new contracts. And that&amp;#039;s only what happened in the profitable (and heavily regulated) part of their business. I imagine that things were similarly awful on the financial services side of AIG.  I&amp;#039;m making no political statement on the bailout itself, just contending that the situation that the financial markets confronted when faced with the imminent collapse of AIG was truly dire.
