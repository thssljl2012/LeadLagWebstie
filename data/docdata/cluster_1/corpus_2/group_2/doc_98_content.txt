More smiles for the MO/PM/KFT holders ~~~ just keeps getting better  and better !!        Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT) on Sept. 22 will be added to the Dow Jones  Industrial Average, replacing troubled insurance giant American  International Group (AIG) , Dow Jones &amp;amp;amp; Co. said Thursday.      The addition of Kraft, the world&amp;#039;s No. 2 packaged food maker,  leaves the Dow under-weighted in financial stocks.      Shares of Kraft and other food makers have performed better than  the overall market. Before Thursday&amp;#039;s announcement, which lifted  Kraft shares by 2%, Kraft&amp;#039;s stock was about even for the year.
