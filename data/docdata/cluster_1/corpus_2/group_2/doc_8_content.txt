 I have my household contents insurance with AIG (I&amp;#039;m a tenant so no buildings insurance).     Following the collapse of Lehman, several news agencies have stated that AIG - who have lost significant amounts over the last 3 quarters - could be next to &amp;#039;collapse&amp;#039;.     My worry is that if AIG go under, what happens to my policy?     Does it just cease to exist?     What steps - if any - should I take now to ensure continuation of cover?     Do I cancel my current policy and take out new cover?  Is that even possible?     I know this may sound rather drastic and seem OTT to some, but I&amp;#039;m sure I&amp;#039;m not the only person wondering what happens to policies in situations like this at the moment!     Any help or advice greatfully received
