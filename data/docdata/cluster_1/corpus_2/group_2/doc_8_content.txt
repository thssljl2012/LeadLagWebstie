 AIG predominantly sold insurance to other investment banks for protection against risky investments, not to individuals for auto, life, health or home insurance    - Oh okay. Thanks. I knew that the subprime mortgage problem had something to with it. I just didn&amp;#039;t what insurfance services the company offers. But yes, if you&amp;#039;re selling insurfance to banks who make risky investments, it ain&amp;#039;t a good idea.
