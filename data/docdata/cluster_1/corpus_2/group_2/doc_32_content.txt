It wouldn&amp;#039;t surprise me if the politicians either do business with or own stock in AIG. This is a bad move.     What you&amp;#039;re saying makes sense in the general scheme of things, but the problem is that the failure of AIG would cause a crippling domino effect on the WORLD MARKET since AIG is not only the largest insurance company in the world, but also the largest reinsurance company in the world. As they say in the news, AIG is &amp;amp;quot;too big to fail&amp;amp;quot; because it would send shockwaves through the entire WORLD economy, not just the US. Unfortunately, we don&amp;#039;t have the luxury of being able to say &amp;amp;quot;screw these guys, they messed up so let them deal with it&amp;amp;quot; because the aftermath would be too far-reaching.
