Because companies have to have money for day to day operations. Usually they get this on credit. If their credit rating goes too low, it raises the costs of getting that money enormously. At some point it just isn&amp;#039;t doable on the kinds of scale required by a company as large as AIG.   quote:  I cannot understand how in the space of just a few weeks an organization can go from being AAA rated to bankrupt.   Big writedowns on insurance guarantees on risky credit swaps caused their credit rating to drop. A lower credit rating means it costs much more money to raise operating capital. If you can&amp;#039;t meet operating expenses, you&amp;#039;re effectively bankrupt, no matter how many &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; assets you have.  AIG has a lot of good assets. Their general insurance subsidiaries are the best in the world, and can generate $20 billion a year in profits.
