 FWIW, Here is a document e-mailed to me from an AIG representative:      AIG&amp;amp;#8217;s challenges do not impact AIG Commercial Insurance&amp;amp;#8217;s capital position.   Here are a few more facts we think are important for you to know&amp;amp;#8230;   &amp;amp;#61623; The liquidity of AIG Commercial Insurance remains very strong.   &amp;amp;#61623; AIG Commercial Insurance&amp;amp;#8217;s substantial capital position is independent of its parent, and   cannot be used by the parent to satisfy its liquidity needs.   &amp;amp;#61623; Since 2005, AIG Commercial Insurance&amp;amp;#8217;s statutory surplus has increased by over 50% to   $26.7 billion.   &amp;amp;#61623; AIG Commercial Insurance&amp;amp;#8217;s ability to pay claims and its commitment to writing challenging   risks is undiminished.   &amp;amp;#61623; AIG Commercial Insurance continues to exhibit strong financial performance with 2008   second quarter operating income of nearly $1 billion, net written premiums of $5.99 billion and   a profitable combined ratio of 93.7%.   AIGCI will communicate developments as they arise, and we look forward to continuing to serve the risk   management needs of our customers and brokers.   Additionally, in the wake of Hurricane Ike this past weekend we want to remind affected   policyholders that we stand ready to help. To report a claim, please call 1-877-244-0304.   If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact an AIG Commercial Insurance representative.
