  Philam mutual fund company says funds are safe         By Ma. Salve Duplito   INQUIRER.net        Posted date: September 16, 2008       MANILA, PHILIPPINESThe Philam Asset Management Inc. (PAMI) said Tuesday investments in the mutual fund companies under its wings are safe and will not be affected by troubles facing American International Group (AIG), the companys parent company.   Karen Liza M. Roa told INQUIRER.net in a telephone interview that under Philippine laws, mutual fund companies are legal entities of their own and are required to get third-party custodians to handle the funds.      Yes, your investments are safeIts not the funds that are in trouble, its the fund managers parent company. We should all be very clear on that, she said.      This means that should AIG close its doors under a worst-case scenario, PAMI may close shop but the fund itself will merely get a new fund manager.      PAMI is the second-biggest mutual fund management company in the Philippines, with around P19 billion assets under management.      (Investments in PAMI-managed mutual funds) are not co-mingled with ours, Roa said.      Under Philippine laws, mutual fund companies have separate and independent members in the board of directors and are required to follow the investment restrictions of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Philippine Investment Company Act. This includes the obligation to buy back any shares that its investors want to redeem.      If you take a look at your investments, they are in Philippine blue chips and in Philippine prime grade fixed income. Citibank is our third-party custodian, Roa said.      AIG, one of the biggest insurance companies in the world, is the latest financial services company battered by the turmoil in the US housing and credit markets.
