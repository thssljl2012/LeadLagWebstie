The expectation is that the actual loss to the government would be much less, precisely because these loans have SOME value in the long run.      Also, as you suggest, this isn&amp;#039;t just a plan to buy foreclosed loans. It&amp;#039;s a plan to buy bad loans (and other assets), including loans that are performing, but cannot be sold because they are tainted by the sub-prime stain.      A big part of this problem is a new accounting rule called &amp;amp;quot;mark to market.&amp;amp;quot; Under the previous rules, you (as a lender) could carry a $200,000 mortage on your balance sheet as a $200,000 asset as long as it is performing (payments are being made). Under mark-to-market, though, you now have to carry that loan on your books at whatever value it would sell for if you had to sell it today. Well, guess what? That loan right now is worth about $0.02 if it even smells like sub-prime paper. Even though the payments are being made and you personally know the house is worth $500,000, you have to carry it on the books as $0.02. That kills you balance sheet and also probably violates YOUR lending covenants, forcing you to pony up cash to YOUR lenders, or curtain retail lending due to reserve requirements.

Did the federal government guarantee this bussiness?                        The problem is that AIG, as a huge insurance holding company, has tremendous financial obligations to other entities, including people, governments and other insurers. If AIG were to be liquidated, it would produce a huge spasm in the insurance and financial markets that would send rates through the roof while quite probably destroying some other insurers. What&amp;#039;s especially bad about this is that the insurance companies AIG owns are actually in great financial shape. It would be a shame for AIG to go down, taking not only its own insurance entities with it, but other independent insurers as well.
