Yes.. there is a word insurance market that insures insurers who insure insurers. For example, Canary Wharf is insured in majority by one company. If the whole thing blew up, there is no way you could expect that insurance company to pay out - instead, they insure the insurance they have sold, as AIG will have done in many parts.
