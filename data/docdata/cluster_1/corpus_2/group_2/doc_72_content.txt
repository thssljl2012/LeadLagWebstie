Again, unless I&amp;#039;m wrong, AIA does only INSURANCE. All investments are done on BEHALF of clients and they take a cut, hence a low, close to zero risk business.    The bigger issue is who will trust them now lor.. But AIA being AIA, I wouldn&amp;#039;t be surprised have enough money to tie this over lar.

AIA said that his decision to leave the company is not related to the recent developments at American International Group (AIG). It was a personal decision that he had been planning for some time.     Mr Kenneth Juneau, executive vice president &amp;amp;amp; senior regional life executive of AIA&amp;#039;s regional office, will assume leadership responsibilities with effect from September 19, 2008 in the interim until a statement is made on the new general manager for AIA Singapore.    Mr Juneau, an AIA veteran, has more than 30 years experience in the insurance industry.    AIG announced on 16 September 2008 that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is providing a two-year, US$85 billion secured revolving credit facility to AIG that will ensure that the company can meet its liquidity needs.    Meanwhile, anxious policyholders lined up outside the Singapore offices of global insurance giant American International Group (AIG) Thursday, despite the US government&amp;#039;s bailout of the firm.    AIA said less than 0.1 per cent or under 2500 policies have been surrendered so far. AIA has about 2.5 million policies in force in Singapore. - CNA/vm     http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stori...376899/1/.html                        business as usual  confidence   Pessimistic       is Something Fking Wrong going to happen?
