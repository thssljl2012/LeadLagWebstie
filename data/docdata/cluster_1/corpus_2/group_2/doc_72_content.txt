     Quote:                         AIG is just another sick puppy that needed to be bashed over the head with a shovel so the other puppies would get more milk. Fucking government                     I think of all the bail outs/loans, AIG&amp;#039;s is arguably the most important. AIG is probably the biggest insurer of both wall street and regular people. AIG insured complex debt securities. These securities are either junk or of value, but either way AIG insured them. With this insurance, the junk and the valuable securities were not risky propositions to buy and trade. If AIG went into bankruptcy or receivership many of these securities could become junk (not tradeable, not worth anything). AIG had billions invested in these. If AIG takes the hit then billions are gone and the whole financial sector is shaken. That could decrease our dollar again, cause more banks to tumble, etc. While AIG might be a sick dog, it is the mother of puppies and the puppies need milk to survive (that is the most corny analogy ever - but it works).
