                                                                       Insurers go down all the time. If AIG goes down it will hurt the economy a bit, but not as much as a bailout would hurt the economy, at least in the long run.       The biggest problem with AIG going south is that the NY Department of Insurance isn&amp;#039;t geared up to handle that big a failure. I&amp;#039;ve done work for the CA Department of Insurance on some large liquidations, but AIG&amp;#039;s would be out of this world. (Just for a point of reference, I spent about six months last year doing the final claims work for an insurance liquidation that took place in  1987 . These things don&amp;#039;t go quickly.)
