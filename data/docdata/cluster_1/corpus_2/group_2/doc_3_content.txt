Paulo reported without saying  where it obtained the information.         Unibanco, as the Brazilian bank is known, has had a  partnership with AIG since 1997 that provides insurance and  pension funds, Folha said. The bank said the Unibanco AIG joint  venture is independent and won&amp;#039;t suffer the effects of AIG&amp;#039;s  results, Folha reported citing a statement from the bank.         Merrill Lynch &amp;amp;amp; Co. Inc., the U.S. investment bank being  bought by Bank of America Corp., also has interests in Brazil.         Merrill may merge Brazilian operations with the investment  banking division of Banco Itau Holding Financiera SA, Folha  said. Merrill could still operate under its own name as an  independent unit reporting to the U.S. headquarters, Folha said.
