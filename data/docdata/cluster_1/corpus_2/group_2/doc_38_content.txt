AIG bought SunAmerica for 18b of stock in 1999. Those seem to be the two largest acquisitions.    I can&amp;#039;t figure if debt issued by these subs is good or not. American General&amp;#039;s only real asset was ownership of various subs. American General itself does not seem to be a regulated sub. I tend to think the NY Fed loan is thus in front of XFP. Furthermore, American General&amp;#039;s subs are things like asset-heavy life insurers and such. Where did the life insurance sub invest all the premiums it collected. With AIGfp? That would not bode well for XFP.      thread start
