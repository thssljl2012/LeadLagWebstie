Most info I&amp;#039;ve been reading on AIG points towards us getting the loan back.  Their insurance core is still solid and posting profits.  They also own over 1000 jets valued at 55billion collectively.       Some estimates have them pegged at being able to repay the debt within a matter of years.  It&amp;#039;s also been suggested that the Fed taking some of the pressure off and allowing them to safely unload the shit is worth it as well.     AIG is also pretty internationa, so them dying = worldwide chaos potentially.
