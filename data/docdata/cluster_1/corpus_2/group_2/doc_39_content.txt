 Hi      I have just been on the phone to my broker for car insurance and they say they have spoken to AIG who say they aren&amp;#039;t going bust.     They also told me that they have 7 other underwriters that they use and my policy will be immediately transferred to one of them if AIG go bust.     I hope this helps.
