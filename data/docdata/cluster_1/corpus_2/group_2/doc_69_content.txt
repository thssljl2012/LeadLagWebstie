The equity positions were taken to enhance the collateral position for the credit facility, as the unencumbered collateral that AIG had to pledge to secure the loan, excluding equity, was insufficient. The value of the equity positions and other collateral, when netted from the debt being extended is nearly a zero sum. Further, the equity position wasn&amp;#039;t taken to enrich the treasury via the receipt of profits as it would under a typical equity position, but rather as a control mechanism to prevent the board from unduly enriching other shareholders and/or moving assets out of the holding company and its subsidiaries outside of its agreement with the Fed. Also, the Fed has vowed to estop payment of dividends during the term of the loan.      Essentially, this was done to allow for AIG to sell off business units in an orderly manner, rather than in a fire sale during BK,which would yield significantly lower gains of sale. Once AIG&amp;#039;s assets are unwound and the debt to the Fed is repaid then the Fed will cancel the warrants. All the Fed gets out of this is the rate on the loan, which is the 3-month LIBOR + 8.5%. That is a pretty healthy return, seeing as most Fortune 500s are pricing similar maturity debt around LIBOR + 2%, but it somewhat accurately reflects the risks inherent in this transaction.       Last, the other big issue outstaing are the Trillions in credit default swaps that AIG was a counterparty to.  These positions are sizable and had the Fed let AIG for into BK, OR if the the Fed took them into conservatorship as with Fannie/Freddie, either action would have led to a trigger against AIG and another capital call.  By taking the equity position this also protects those CDS from being executed by the counterparty.       AIG still has value.  Its insurance business is very successful and profitable.       I can also explain to you how fair value accounting, and not actual losses, are what brought about the current banking crisis, but I&amp;#039;ve typed enough and I&amp;#039;m sure you don&amp;#039;t care.  Plus, I&amp;#039;m sure I have proven my point, which is that you don&amp;#039;t actually know jack shit about this whole mess, but you found a clever little quip somewher and wanted to sound smart.       Go ahead and take your obligatory shot at me for not having an Ivy league education.  I&amp;#039;ll laugh with you knowing that I still know a whole lot more than you about pretty much anything, especially financial markets and lending structures.                          L.O.L.
