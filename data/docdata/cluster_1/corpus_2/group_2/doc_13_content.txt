It&amp;#039;s a tough question..personally I&amp;#039;d rather allow a failing company to fail..and be replaced by one that doesn&amp;#039;t make the same mistakes..I think that the problem is that companies such as AIG do more than just carry insurance..and the effect of allowing it to fail may just be too far reaching at a time when the economy is a little unstable. (by the way...AIG is one of my company&amp;#039;s clients...I hope that we get paid).
