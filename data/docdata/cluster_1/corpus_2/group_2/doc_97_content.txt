I wouldn&amp;#039;t quote The Weekly Standard or the RNC to back up an arguement, and then demand some one find fault.    The NY times has become nothing more than than a left wing blog of the same quality as the Huffingtard post.                       http://www.reuters.com/article/newsO...080918?sp=true     will Reuters do?

Not all the sellers were insurance companies like AIG -- most were not. But the protection buyer usually knew the protection seller.    As it grew -- according to the industry&amp;#039;s trade group, the credit default market grew to $46 trillion by the first half of 2007 from $631 billion in 2000 -- all that changed.    An over-the-counter market grew up and some of the most active players became asset managers, including hedge fund managers, who bought and sold the policies like any other investment.    And in those deals, they sold protection as often as they bought it -- although they rarely set aside the reserves they would need if the obligation ever had to be paid.    In one notorious case, a small hedge fund agreed to insure UBS AG (UBSN.VX: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), the Swiss banking giant, from losses related to defaults on $1.3 billion of subprime mortgages for an annual premium of about $2 million.    The trouble was, the hedge fund set up a subsidiary to stand behind the guarantee -- and capitalized it with just $4.6 million. As long as the loans performed, the fund made a killing, raking in an annualized return of nearly 44 percent.    But in the summer of 2007, as home owners began to default, things got ugly. UBS demanded the hedge fund put up additional collateral. The fund balked. UBS sued.&amp;#039;  - that&amp;#039;s 46 trillion in loans...up from just over 600 billion...and as noted in the article...the folks doing the trading  lied  about insuring it, but took that money too    deal with facts rather than spin, wishful thinking, pixie dust or partisan talking points    thanks for playing...
