I see some LEH-CALLxx/yy around, but my bloomie seems to only list paper of the non-bankrupt subsidiaries. LEH Bros HLDG as a couple of issues trading at 1 or 2 cents There are a total of 738 LEH bondlike objects out there. Some of the LEH Bros HLDG are trading as high as 28 that traded today. LEH 6 5/8.      Ref AIG: NYT story &amp;quot;The Fed plans to offer an $85 bn bridge loan to AIG in return for control of the ailing insurance giant, people briefed on the matter said Tuesday night.&amp;quot; They can&amp;#039;t seize a conservatorship, but they can offer one in exchange for the bridge loan. &amp;quot;AN AIG collapse woud be an even bigger systemic threat to major financial firms than Lehman&amp;#039;s downfall, because of the company&amp;#039;s dominant position in insuring mortgage-linked securities. Should AIG fail, it would kick off a wave of additional write-downs at banks already staggering&amp;amp;nbsp; from the credit crisis.&amp;quot;      A game of chicken indeed. If we don&amp;#039;t like your terms, we will file and take everyone down with us including our shareholders, vs. we will give you a bridge loan to let you get a workout underway, but we get to run the company for the benefit of everyone.            thread start
