Which is exactly why the AIG blow-up is a non-event. AIG is a big time insurer, with a lot insurance businesses and financial services. The big guys (Allianz, MnchnerRck, SwissRe) will be very happy to buy out those businesses at a steep discount. Alone the ILFC airplane leasing business is a fucking goldmine and worth A LOT.
