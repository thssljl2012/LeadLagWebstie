Insurance departments have very strict regulations on companies. They also have Guaranty Association that protects against such things happening that all companies particpate in. While there have been several companies go under there has always been other companies standing in line to buy their block of business.      AIG Insurance portfolio is seperate from it&amp;#039;s mortgage investments.      An adverse effect that does occur is whole life products--especially varible life- where premium is dictated by return investments--can fluxuate greatly--and premiums become unaffordable.      I have never been an advocate of mixing investments with life insurance--and have written basically only guarantee premiums and death benefits. While it is plain jane product with no bells and whistles--it lets a person sleep a lot better following huge market or interest rates fluxuations.
