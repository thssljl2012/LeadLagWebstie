                               I would 1035 out of any AIG product I owned (disclaimer: I am licensed to sell AIG life insurance and own an AIG/American General term policy) ASAP.  Even if there were surrender charges I might still entertain the idea of running from AIG, depending upon the severity of the charges.   Then, the question becomes where to go.  I would move annuity money to AXA Equitable and life money to a A++ rated insurer with a no lapse GUARANTEE on UL or the cheapest coverage for term.
