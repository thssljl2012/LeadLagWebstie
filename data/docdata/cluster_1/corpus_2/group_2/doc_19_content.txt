AIG will be forced sell their insurance companies - they are some of the most profitable holdings that they have.     Somebody stronger will step in, and it&amp;#039;ll be business as usual.                      Of course you are right, not questioning that, zero chance of policies going to the state.      I&amp;#039;m not encouraging anyone to switch carriers, but offer to rewrite the policy if they choose, but don&amp;#039;t encourage in the least. AIG is virtually unbeatable for large face amounts, rated cases, and ROP Term.      I don&amp;#039;t like replacing life policies, unless the policy is fairly new and the price is out of whack. Had too many claims, barely out of the 2 year period. Just curious how some others are handling it.
