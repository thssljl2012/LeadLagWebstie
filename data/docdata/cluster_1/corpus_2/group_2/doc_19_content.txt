 BAK Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              AIG:  MKS &amp;amp; XFP from insurance subsidiary (I think)   The &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; AIG subsidiary is, I suppose, is AIGFP (AIG Financial Products Corp)      10K 2007:&amp;amp;nbsp;  AIG guarantees all of  AIGFP s debt.   Included in 2007 net income and adjusted net income was a charge of $11.47 billion pretax ($7.46 billion after tax) of run realized market valuation losses related to the AIG Financial Products Corp.( AIGFP) supersenior credit default swap portfolio. Based upon its most current analysis, AIG believes any losses that are realized over time on the super senior credit default swap portfolio of AIGFP will not be material ...       Note 11 &amp;quot;Debt Outstanding&amp;quot;, pp. 171-172, 10K for 2007   For  AIGLH  (AIG Life Holdings, formerly known as American General Corporation), a holding company and a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG -- [This is the holding for insurer(s), life insurance/annuity/supplemental health ... in 2007 10K, held 20% of total AIG assets].    (e) Liabilities Connected to Trust Preferred Stock: AIGLH ... At December 31, 2007, the preferred stock outstanding consisted of $300 million liquidation value of 8.5 percent preferred stock issued by American General Capital II in June 2000, $500 million liquidation value of 8.125 percent preferred stock issued by American General Institutional Capital B in March 1997, and $500 million liquidation value of 7.57 percent preferred stock issued by  American   General Institutional Capital A  in December 1996.        XFP -- underlying securities issued by &amp;quot;American General Institutional Capital A&amp;quot;   MKS -- underlying securities issued by &amp;quot;American General Institutional Capital A&amp;quot;      So MKS &amp;amp;amp; XFP are supported by debt issued by an insurance holdco/subsidiary of AIG.&amp;amp;nbsp;       KNO &amp;amp;amp; XFD, as already mentioned here on the forum were issued by SunAmerica -- Quantumonline says SunAmerica is the &amp;quot;predecessor to American International Group Inc&amp;quot; in the description of XFD, or SunAmerica is &amp;quot;a subsidiary of American Intl Group Inc&amp;quot;.      From the subsidiary list on pp. 209-214 2007 10K, it appears to me that &amp;quot;SunAmerica Life Insurance Company&amp;quot; is a subsidiary of &amp;quot;AIG Retirement Services,&amp;quot; which is in turn a subsidiary of &amp;quot;AIG Life Holdings (US), Inc. &amp;quot;      So why are MKS &amp;amp;amp; XFP trading at a third the price of KNO &amp;amp;amp; XFD?&amp;amp;nbsp; This seems crazy, unless there are big problems in some other subsidiaries of AIGLF.      Does anyone know which level of AIG issued AFF &amp;amp;amp; AVF?&amp;amp;nbsp; They are trading at prices intermediate between XFP and KNO/XFD?      Link to the 2007 AR:      http://www.ezodproxy.com/AIG/2008/AR2007/images/AIG_AR2007.pdf       Yesterday I bought a bunch of XFD &amp;amp;amp; some MKS, mostly hedged by shorts on AIG, along with some Oct 14 &amp;amp;amp; 16 calls just in case.&amp;amp;nbsp; Well underwater on that for the moment.      Also bought some unhedged KNO &amp;amp;amp; XFD -- but why keep them if MKS &amp;amp;amp; XFP are also as &amp;quot;secure&amp;quot; because not issued by the mothership?      Alan
