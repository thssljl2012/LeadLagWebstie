AIG is very big in China as the insurer of Chinese life insurance along with business insurance.  AIG also buys and leases 747's and has purchased 787's and leases them to airlines.  These are very profitable parts of AIG that will probably be sold off and Chinese money is the most logical buyer.    As I understand it there was a 350 person AIG office based in London that handled the insuring of derivative and bundled mortage paper that is at the core of AIG's current situation. (AIG has about 115,000 employees) If AIG insured it, any paper traded was never going to be your problem as a trader/seller or buyer.  But this one AIG's unit screwed up big time.
