            Quote from: jaycee on March 04, 2009, 12:25:59 PM   is it Allianz or Alianz?  Alianz appears to be a San Jose real estate investing company  Allianz appears to be the German equivalent to AIG   It&#039;s the German bank/insurance Co. I think they are supposed to be one of the biggest in the world. The one that lost about 5% of it&#039;s value last wekk sometime! ha!!!!!
