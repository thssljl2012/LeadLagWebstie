Note to self: Add jps to the marginally stupid list............... until proven otherwise.              Okay JPS I have been listening to the cspan hearings about AIG today on and off when in the house.   The figure I heard was 30-36 billion additional for AIG.   ( not that they might not need more later)  But where did you get your figure from jp?            You do realize that AIG is one huge entangled mess that should have never been allowed to happen had the markets been regulated?          They do insurance of all kinds           But           They also have a huge venture capital firm that has been the main financier for companies like Boeing and GE.            They insure the loses to private pension accounts          AIGs Life Insurance &amp; Retirement Services operations          AIGs Life Insurance &amp; Retirement Services operations besides having a large stake in almost every major US insurance company AIG's affiliate  ALICO has operations either directly or through subsidiaries in Europe, including the United Kingdom, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, South Asia and the Far East, with Japan being the largest territo ry. AIA operates primarily in China (including Hong Kong), Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, Indonesia and India . The operations in India are conducted through a joint venture, Tata AIG Life Insurance Company Limited. Nan Shan operates in Taiwan. Philamlife is a life insurer in the Philippines. AIG Star Life and AIG Edison Life operate in Japan. Operations in foreign countries comprised 80% of Life Insurance &amp; Retirement Services premiums and other considerations, during 2008. ................................     Yep that is right if we let AIG fail ......................... goodbye America as a economic super power.  It would not only hurt the US economy it would literally trash a lot of other countries economies.  Good bye Americas credit rating and we couldn't get another nation to do buisness with us anywhere.
