Jeckel  Writedowns (M2M) are causing AIG to post these huge losses. The insurance business seems to be healthy.    There is a big difference between operational loss (p&amp;l) and balance sheet "loss", and at some point a large portion of these so called losses (mainly writedowns) will appreciate in value generating massive profits in future.
