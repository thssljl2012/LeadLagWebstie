      I think the scenerio would be most biz will be listed. AIG will operate as a holding company...        Part of the listing maybe 10% - 20% will be floated for repayment and the garment can sell existing stake in the open market. The P&amp;L will still be reported under AIG as a holding...         You just treat these units like JV or subsidiary. But the biggest part of their problem is still AIG Finance which I doubt could be listed.... it is this 300B liability giant that is causing the problem. But when the market recovers, the CDS will normalise and this eventually will become AIG's core business....           If drop to 0.20 I buy somemore...
