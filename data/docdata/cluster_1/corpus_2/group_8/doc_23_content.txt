Just not bucking the trend.      ----      Hartford Cut by S&amp;P on Concern for Insurers Brand (Update2)   2009-03-03 23:02:26.190 GMT              (Adds analysts comment in the fifth paragraph.)      By Erik Holm        March 3 (Bloomberg) -- Hartford Financial Services Group   Inc., the insurer that lost $2.75 billion last year, was   downgraded by Standard &amp; Poors for the third time in a month on   concern that the deepening recession may hurt the brand.        S&amp;P cut the counterparty credit rating to BBB from BBB+ and   said capital needed to fund Hartfords variable-annuity business   could meaningfully exceed the amount thats not committed to   other parts of the company, according to a statement today.        Hartfords earnings, capitalization, and financial   flexibility have been weakened considerably by the deepening   equity market decline, continuing volatility, and significant   asset impairments in the past two quarters, the statement said.   The uncertainty of this financial stress could erode Hartfords   brand.        Life insurers are setting aside more funds to cover   potential payouts to customers who were given minimum-return   guarantees on variable annuities linked to the performance of   stock markets. With the S&amp;P 500 below 700, those guarantees   absorb almost all the excess capital at Hartford and rival   Prudential Financial Inc., according to Randy Binner, an analyst   at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc.        At this point, most of the companies are at least at risk   of having to raise capital, Binner said. Investors are   increasingly uncomfortable with the space.        Chief Executive Officer Ramani Ayer is cutting jobs and   seeking government aid to replace capital depleted by investment   declines. Hartford, with a stag logo and a Web site that says   trusted since 1810, slashed its dividend 84 percent last week   after posting an $806 million fourth-quarter loss and missing its   own capital target.                            Negative Implications           The life and property insurer said in a regulatory filing   Feb. 12 that a ratings cut may have negative implications for   our competitive position. We may also need to raise additional   capital or consider other transactions to manage our capital   position and liquidity.         Company executives have said that some of the effects of a   downgrade would be mitigated by rivals also being cut by ratings   firms. Standard &amp; Poors cut 10 life insurers Feb. 27, when it   last reduced Hartfords credit grade to BBB+ from A-.        Were in with a pack of firms that are getting challenged   from a ratings standpoint, said John Walters, the president of   Hartfords life insurance business, in a conference call with   analysts and investors on Feb. 6. That said, it will present a   headwind that well have to work our way through.        The shares, which fell 9.4 percent today to $4.63 in 4:15   p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, have tumbled from   more than $106 in 2007 as investors grew concerned that insurers   might run short on assets needed to pay claims. The stock fell   another 48 cents, or 10 percent, at 5:29 p.m. in after-hours   trading.        Shannon Lapierre, a Hartford spokeswoman, declined to   comment on the downgrade in an e-mail.        American International Group Inc., whose advertising slogan   used to state that the insurer had the strength to be there,   changed the name of an auto insurance unit that sells coverage on   the internet and said this week it would rebrand its commercial   insurance operations. AIG yesterday said it lost $61.7 billion in   the fourth quarter, the biggest loss of any corporation in U.S.   history.
