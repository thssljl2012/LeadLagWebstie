  I want answered....AIG is an insurance company. Most if not all of their losses are in the division that wrote "credit default swaps" and their derivatives. In other words they are writing checks to cover losses on junk (collateralized debt obligations) and other mortgage defaults.   WHERE ARE THOSE CHECKS GOING?
