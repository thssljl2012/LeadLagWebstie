           jje1953    Message #13 03/03/09 11:10 AM        AIG can'tallow the assets that back their life/annuity contracts, to dip below statutory reserve levels, without going into receivershipby theState Insurance Department where they are domiciled. If they did,the company wouldbe taken over by the State Insurance Commissioner, and every form of help they are getting at the Federal level would be moot. Of course, AIG has all kinds of different entities, so you have to distinguish one from another, but suffice to say, if they can't show the assets on the books, that back their life/annuity policies, they're done dealin'. I doubt like hell, theywill let one of the few strong entities they still have, go into receivership.      If you want to know what really happens, when a life insurance company threatens to dip below statutory reserve levels, check out the website for Standard Life of Indiana, which is going through the process I describe:  http://www. standardlifeofindian   a .com/       Anyway, telling people to cash in their policies, is about 180 degrees the opposite of what they should do, even if AIG Life   was   in receivership, which they aren't.
