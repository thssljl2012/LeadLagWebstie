Each insurance company licensed to do business in a state pays a percentage of the face value of each policy written in that state into a state insurance fund overseen by the state insurance commissioner. The fund is not to bail out the insurance companies but rather to pay claims on outstanding policies should an insurance company go bankrupt. This is to protect the policy holders, not the insurance companies.
