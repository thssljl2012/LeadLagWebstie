AIG's core is insurance which makes a bancruptcy buy out very expensive, as an insurer AIG has to maintain the cash amount that it is liable for. Meaning even in bancrupty protection a buyer would have pay 1-1 for AIG's insurance holdings, as the largest insurer there are very few companies with the cash availalbe to do the that even if the credit market was healthy. That's really the root of AIG's problem, they have a massive stock pile of funds in it's name but can't touch it because legally it's not really there's if they would use those funds they'd instantly default on God knows how many policies.                      Apparently they don't have the cash for the contracts they signed.      Thus they should INCREASE THEIR RATES      Or DROP CUSTOMERS.      Yet we feed people money.   Cute
