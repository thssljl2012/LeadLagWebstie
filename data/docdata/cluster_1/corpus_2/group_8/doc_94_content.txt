I am an insurance agent. the company that I primarily represent is in active negotiations to buy the personal lines divisions of AIG. If there was a bankruptcy I am not convinced the scenario described above would occur. It would seem to me that other carriers would seek to acquire the insurance policies and assets at a discount before it would go to the regulators -- AIG problems are not in the insurance side but where they invested their assets -in highly speculative - high return products&#8212;such as derivatives -- this allowed them to buy market share on the insurance side using these inflated returns to sell insurance at a loss. most insurance companies are invested in very conservative &amp; short term investments-- these investments or reserves are always on call (in order to pay claims)-- AIG has already sold its reinsurance business to Munich Re at about a $200 million discount from a couple of years ago. 21st Century Auto Insurance is likely to be sold next.
