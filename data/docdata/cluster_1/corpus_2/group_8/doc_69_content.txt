&gt; What happen        "From Answers.yahoo.com:    If AIG bankrupt, other insurance company will take over you insurance and your insurance will run normally. That is the rule of insurance company. Insurance company reassurance the company and the customers to other insurance company.    In this case if you live in America your insurance will go to other company and you must pay annually to the new company. But if you live in another country, you do not need to worry because different country have different rules and policy. Although branch of "American" AIG in other country, like example AIG outside America, AIU (American International Underwriters), AIA (American International Assurance),etc, that are member of AIG has give donation to save the bankrupt. But if AIG in America bankrupt, that will not affect your insurance in outside American country. John Hancock insurance in Indonesia was bankrupt at Indonesia but other insurance company take over the customers and the insurance run as written in their policy but the customers pay annually to the new insurance company that take over John Hancock Insurance in Indonesia, in this case they pay to Sequis Life, Allianz and Sun Life".        ===================================    In my opinion, the payment to client can be resolved based on priorities, purpose of insurance, value re-adjustment, liability re-adjustment etc.        First priorities: personal health insurance, life insurance, insurance for children college fund (all with certain re-adjustment). For insurance on cars, homes, offices, the  real present value of the cars/property should be used and the insurance fee and term are re-adjusted.         Insurance for subprime Mortgage / investment / speculation: NO PAYMENT AT ALL.
