LaRouche emphasized that the operation being run by Bernanke, et al. is a complete failure. Today, for example, shares of the Citibank were selling for 97 cents on the stock exchange. You can now buy a share of this premier U.S. bank at a dollar store. LaRouche pointed out that the reality of Citibank&#039;s condition does not restore its appeal. It was also revealed today that General Motor&#039;s submitted an auditor&#039;s report to the Securities and Exchange Commission which said in part: "The corporation&#039;s recurring losses from operations, stockholders&#039; deficit, and inability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations and sustain its operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern." LaRouche commented that in fact GM is the "subject of ongoing concern."
