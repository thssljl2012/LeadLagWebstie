6 Insurance Cos. bosses got over $5M  Healthy Paychecks By Christine McConville  Friday, March 6, 2009 - Updated 1h ago  Earning $40 million, Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. Chief Executive Edmund Ted Kelly was by far the states highest-paid insurance firm executive last year. But hes not the only one who had a multimillion-dollar pay day in 2008.  According to new executive compensation filings at the Massachusetts Division of Insurance, six of the 16 insurers that do business in Massachusetts paid their top executives more than $5 million last year.  The jaw-dropping sums represent just a sliver of the financial information the firms sent in to the state this year - but they do provide a window into the profitable world of insurance.  Each year, state-approved insurers must submit comprehensive financial data to help the state assess the firms financial stability.  A review of executive pay shows that as the industry enjoyed a few very strong years, executives enjoyed dramatic pay increases.  Kelly, who is based in Boston, doubled his compensation, from $19.1 million in 2006 to $40 million last year, and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. CEO Stuart Reeses pay soared from $10.9 million in 2006 to $15.4 million last year.  New England Life Insurance Co. CEO Carl R. Henriksons pay went from $5.6 million in 2006 to $9.5 million in 2008. Also that year, Commerce Insurance CEO Gerald Fels was paid $7.2 million while Paul Revere Life Insurance Co. CEO Thomas R. Watjen made $5.4 million.  Former Allstate Insurance Co. board chairman Edward M. Liddy, who now heads troubled insurance giant AIG, was paid a whopping $24.2 million in 2008, according to company filings. Allstates current chairman and CEO, Thomas Wilson, made $5.9M in 2008.  Spokesmen for some of the insurance companies defended the pay packages.  Liberty Mutual spokesman John Cusolito said Kelly runs a global company with $26 billion in 2007 revenue and 45,000 employees. He also said that less than 10 percent of Kellys $40 million pay is annual salary.  The rest is long-term compensation primarily exercised from a phantom stock-option plan analogous to those at public companies, Cusolito wrote in an e-mail.  And MassMutual spokesman Jim Lacey said Reeses 2008 pay reflects the companys extremely strong performance in 2007.  Reeses $15.4 million - which included a $13.9 million bonus - reflects his achievement relative to his peers, Lacey said.  Later in 2008, MassMutual was rocked by investment losses, but Lacey said that comparing Reeses $15 million pay to that recent upheaval is like comparing apples to oranges.    http://www.bostonherald.com/business/ge ... ition=also
