    Quote:                  Insurance giant AIG has reported a loss of $61.7bn (43bn) in the final three months of 2008 - the largest quarterly loss in corporate history.     And the firm will receive an extra $30bn from the US government as part of a revamped rescue package.                How much do you reckon the ex CEOs will get as their golden parachute in pension pay-offs?
