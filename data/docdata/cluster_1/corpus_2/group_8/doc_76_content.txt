 In the past few days it has come to light that AIG is spinning off its Insurance business      This spin off business has 170 Billion (+ or -) of Assets - 40 Billion annual premium income and is day one profitable --       This new business is comprised of healthy assets from those insurance and annuity contracts that have always been subjected to State Regulation and have always been walled of from the liabilities of the parent although they were used as assets to help the parent extend itself debt.      The stock will be held by AIG stockholders -- NOT the Public because we are still a week or so away from converting the PUBLICS preferred stocks to common stocks      It looks like the toxics are being left behind for the Public -- It looks like the Investors have saved a huge part of their investments -- It looks like a BR that was handled without Federal Oversight      It looks just like the GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY that I and others have claimed the bailouts to be      What say you Marty ???
