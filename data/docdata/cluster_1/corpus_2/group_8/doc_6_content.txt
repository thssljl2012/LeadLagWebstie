The American company also said in an email sent to Reuters that it was "in active discussions" with the club regarding the current four-year $100 million deal, which runs until next May.                                   Quote:                         Manchester United relies on sponsorship for around a third of its revenues. The club pays around 43 million pounds ($59 million) a year to service 660 million pounds in debt created when U.S. owner Malcolm Glazer bought the club in 2005.
