Not necessarily. You always need to watch the insurance ratings of your company. Keep in mind that many of those ratings companies are under intense scrutiny for not doing their jobs these past few years. AIG is one such insurance company that I would be worried about. I was an investor with them a long time but also left long before the recent findings about their unethical practices. No company is 100% safe.
