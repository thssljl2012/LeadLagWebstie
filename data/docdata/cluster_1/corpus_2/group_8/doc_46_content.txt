    With ILFC's parent company (AIG) is all sorts of bother - what's an insurance company doing ownign the world's largest aircraft leasing company anyway? - it has been speculated that buyers would be sought for saleable assets of AIG with ILFC being one of them.      This was suggested back in September and since then silence, with the news that AIG has had further government cash this week does this make the sale of ILFC more or less likely and if they do sell who's likely to buy?
