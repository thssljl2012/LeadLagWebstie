 Edited on Tue Mar-03-09 01:19 AM by barb162         Other insurers can just pick off the business or AIG employees without buying the actual AIG companies.  If that happens, then it becomes a real mess. The AIG subsidiary insurance companies are quite profitable unless insureds stop using them, the employees leave to go to profitable companies, etc.
