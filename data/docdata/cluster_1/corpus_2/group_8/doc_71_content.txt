  They are not shrinking their business.  If you read into the recent news, there was a massive restructuring of the property and casualty companies within AIG.  In fact, many insurance experts are touting their recent restructure as making them more powerful in comparison to their competitors.  The P&amp;C companies are the lifeblood of the organization and bring in billions of dollars to the company.  In addition, their Asian life (AIA) and other life (ALICO) divisions were given to the government as form of partial repayment of the intial loan.  AIG, as a company name, may go away, but the profitible divisions that rule the company will still remain and contribute to the payoff of the loan.

A much smaller AIG is never, ever going to be able to return $163 billion to the taxpayers. And there sale of assets is not happening either. I seldom agree with Rogers(he always talks his own book) but in this case he is spot on. AIG is already dead, they just don't know it yet.
