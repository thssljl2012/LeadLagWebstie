 what's the deal with AIG?  All the DU posts I see about insurance talk about their high administrative costs, record profits, etc.  I did a google search but can't find a definitive answer as to how all of this meshes with their $62 billion loss this last quarter.  Did they have a particular product that didn't work or something?
