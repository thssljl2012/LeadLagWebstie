                QUOTE(hamster9 &#064; May 11 2008, 08:03 PM)   more sales doesn't mean more stable footing... some probably have higher sales people than another. just like Maybank... they have so many branch in malaysia... and also the highest share and etc..but is their service is good? I would say no.  does bonus really matter when it comes to our own personal protection? I remember keeping a newspaper cutting somewhere back in 2003 where a man lost his hand but no claims can be made even tho he brought 13 policy paying annual premium of nearing RM48K from GE. Why? Normally people who know about insurance would say that he did not buy any Personal Accident. So whose fault is that? I would say the agent serving him was unprofessional by not educating their client to be fully protected. Knowingly Personal Accident is so cheap with lesser commission.       AIA is world wide... subsidary company of AIG who is the main sponsor of Manchester United. GE is from Singapore...so far they are active in Malaysia and Singapore only, probably in other Asian country.  I'm a staff from AIG                 Many agents keep saying that their insurance companies are world wide. When we ask in details, they can't answer it...
