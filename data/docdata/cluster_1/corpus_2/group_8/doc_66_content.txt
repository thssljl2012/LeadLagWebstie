Other significant activities include Financial Services and Asset Management. AIGs major product and service groupings are General Insurance, Life Insurance &amp; Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management. Through these operating segments, AIG provides insurance, financial and investment products and services to both businesses and individuals in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions."       http://http://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&amp;q=NYSE:AIG       Apparently, they did have quite a bit of exposure through mortgage lending for real estate and may have stopped that operation in 2008 due to their horrific exposure.      In September of last year, the Federal Government took over AIG.  I had read somewhere the reason for this was due to AIG's heavy involvement in government employee insurance and retirement/pension assets.      So, the government allowed Lehman Brothers, a non-bank, to fail.  AIG it did not allow them to fail and continue to provide money, all in the interest in protecting the government's employees.  What about the regular Joe's whose company had their holding in Lehman Brothers?      Oh yeah, now you see why the government is keen on bailing AIG out hand over fist.  If I find the link for the tie-in of AIG to the government accounts, I'll post it.
