I'm not concerned one bit.  Even though AIG Holdings is receiving bailout money, the life insurance portion of the company is still doing fine.      Same thing with Primerica.  Citi is receiving bailout but Primerica is financially sound (more so than most carriers).      AIG Life and Primerica's business is separate from the parent companies due to insurance regulations.
