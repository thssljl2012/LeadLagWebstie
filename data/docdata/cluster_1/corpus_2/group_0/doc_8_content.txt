                                                       Kaka has set his heart on a shock transfer to Chelsea, according                         to his advisor.                           A report this morning claims the FIFA World Player of the Year                         was the subject of discussions between the Barclays Premier League                         club and the Brazilian&amp;#039;s current employers, AC Milan, this                         week.                           The Italians secured the signing of the 26-year-old&amp;#039;s                         international team-mate Ronaldinho on Wednesday despite their                         well-publicised financial difficulties, and Kaka&amp;#039;s personal                         assistant Diogo Kotscho is adamant all parties involved now want                         the deal to go through.                           If it did, Kaka would be reunited with Blues manager Luiz Felipe                         Scolari who handed him a Brazil debut in 2002 at the age of 20, and                         then included him in the squad that went on to win the World Cup                         that year.                           &amp;#039;Real Madrid offered 90 million euros (71million) last summer                         and Milan did not even think about the bid,&amp;#039; Kotscho told The                         Guardian.                           &amp;#039;This time is different. This is the first time we feel that a                         deal will definitely happen.                           &amp;#039;Because of the situation Milan are in at the moment, the deal                         is good for all parties involved.                           &amp;#039;The move would represent a significant increase in Kaka&amp;#039;s                         salary, on top of the 10% transfer fee that goes straight to the                         player anyway - some 15 million euros (12million).                           &amp;#039;Chelsea are the club to be at right now. They are building a                         team to win everything.&amp;#039;                           Any deal for arguably the planet&amp;#039;s best player seems certain to                         break the world record transfer fee of 46million set when Real                         Madrid signed Zinedine Zidane from Juventus in 2001.
