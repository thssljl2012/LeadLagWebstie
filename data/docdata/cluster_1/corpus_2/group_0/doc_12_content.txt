 Just found out that someone 2 streets over got there wheels stolen off there Charger 2 weeks ago. They had after market rims even. Then the insurance guy said a week ago someone got there wheels stolen off there Charger down at the plaza. Both times they were left on landscaping bricks sitting on the rotors. So if you have a Charger keep a watch on your shit. Also if you see a charger driving around with different wheels everyday then be suspicious lol _________________      2007 GSX-R 600-Nice Weather DD  11.03  1.94 60ft    1990 Thunderturd-Bad Weather    2005 Cobalt SS/SC-Girlfriends, but we all know girls cannot drive manuals...i keed        Need a good insurance deal?
