         Chelsea reject approach from Inter for Lampard      Chelsea have told Inter Milan they will not even discuss the possibility of selling Frank Lampard.      Reports this morning say the Serie A club, now managed by former Blues boss Jose Mourinho, had made an official bid for the England midfielder.    But Chelsea have this morning strongly denied those claims and insist they &amp;#039;will not enter into any discussions&amp;#039; over the transfer.   The Barclays Premier League and Champions League runners-up have also insisted that no bid was made by the Italians.   The full statement, released via the club&amp;#039;s website, read: &amp;#039;Chelsea Football club can confirm it has received an official approach from Internazionale to discuss the possible transfer of Frank Lampard.   &amp;#039;Contrary to reports, no financial offer was made.   &amp;#039;Chelsea FC has informed Inter this morning that we will not enter into any discussion regarding the transfer of Frank Lampard.&amp;#039;   The 30-year-old&amp;#039;s future at Stamford Bridge has been the subject of intense speculation over the summer.   New manager Luiz Felipe Scolari&amp;#039;s recent arrival coincided with the signing of attacking midfielder Deco from Barcelona, leading to suggestions that the former West Ham player might be less than integral to his plans.   With Lampard entering the final year of his Blues contract, speculation mounted that Chelsea might be willing to cash in, while it was even reported that he might buy out the last 12 months of his deal, as is permitted under FIFA rules.   And it now appears that Lampard will have to force the issue if he is determined to leave west London as the club dig in their heels.       ESPNsoccernet
