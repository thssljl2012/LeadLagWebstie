                   Guys, I am wondering if affiliate marketing is legal for insurance web sites. I know there are some insurance sites that pay a fee if someone signs up for a quote or fills out a contact form, but I want to do something a little different with actually paying for people who sign up for a policy online. Here is my plan      I use affiliate marketers to market my nationwide online insurance company. We are very similar to esurance except we will be offering insurance in 50 states. Basically I want to give a  high %commission  on each insurance policy that is signed up through our site. I don&amp;#039;t if this is legal or not, but I think it is a great idea because there is a ton of money in the online insurance world. We will basically be giving up a good percentage of our commission to the affiliate.      Anybody have any idea if this is legal? Is so I think it would be a huge hit because there is a lot of money and residual income for insurance policies.
