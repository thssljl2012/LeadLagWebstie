Here is my plan      I use affiliate marketers to market my nationwide online insurance company. We are very similar to esurance except we will be offering insurance in 50 states. Basically I want to give a  high %commission  on each insurance policy that is signed up through our site. I don&amp;#039;t if this is legal or not, but I think it is a great idea because there is a ton of money in the online insurance world. We will basically be giving up a good percentage of our commission to the affiliate.      Anybody have any idea if this is legal? Is so I think it would be a huge hit because there is a lot of money and residual income for insurance policies.                      Hey,      I use to be in the Insurance business so I know that you can do this as long as you are not paying the customer/client and are only paying the affiliate who gave you the lead/sale.      It will be seen as a referral fee. The key is you can NEVER rebate or pay a client to purchase your insurance product.      Good Luck!
