   The Serious Fraud Office has started a "preliminary inquiry" into the UK activities of American insurance firm AIG, best known as the shirt sponsor of Manchester United.    The insurer, now effectively 80% owned by the US government, became one of the biggest casualties of the credit crunch last September when it was forced to seek an $85bn (59bn) emergency credit facility from the Federal Reserve.    The SFO said its inquiry would focus on AIG's subsidiary, AIG Financial Products Corporation, in co-operation with City regulators and with US authorities, which are probing the same business.    SFO director Richard Alderman said: "It is right for us to look into the UK operations  to determine if there has been criminal conduct. We will use our full range of powers to seek information, to speak to those with an inside knowledge of the company's operations."    It is the second time in as many months that the SFO has made public its early-stage inquiries into the actions of companies where there is a parallel investigation under way in the US.    Last month the agency said it was probing the UK interests of disgraced former hedge fund manager and confessed fraudster Bernard Madoff. In both cases it is thought unlikely the SFO's actions will lead to an independent criminal investigation and prosecution in a British court.    Previously the SFO offered co-operation with US and other overseas prosecutors on a private basis. Alderman has made clear he intends to use these requests for help as a platform to raise the SFO's profile.    AIG said it would co-operate fully with the SFO. It understands the inquiry is not related to AIG's foreign or domestic insurance businesses. In a statement, it said: "As previously disclosed, AIG began the process of unwinding certain of AIGFP's and its subsidiaries' businesses and portfolios, including those in the UK, late last year."
