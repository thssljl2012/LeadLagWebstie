UK's Serious Fraud Office to probe AIG unit Thursday, February 12, 2009 LONDON  Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has launched a preliminary inquiry into suspected irregularities at a British subsidiary of American International Group Inc., the SFO said on Thursday. The SFO said its probe into the UK operations of AIG Financial Products Corp did not concern the insurance operations of AIG in Britain or elsewhere. It is right for us to look into the UK operations of AIG Financial Products Corp to determine if there has been criminal conduct, Richard Alderman, director of the SFO, said in a statement. We will use our full range of powers to seek information and to speak to those with an inside knowledge of the company's operations. AIG said it was co-operating fully with the SFO investigation. The SFO said its probe was separate to two other inquiries into AIG Financial Products Group being carried out by U.S. authorities and Britain's financial services regulator, the Financial Service Authority. AIG, once the world's biggest insurer by market value, averted bankruptcy last year after a $152-billion rescue package from the U.S. government. Its troubles were the result of the Financial Product Group's heavy losses on toxic mortgage debt.  Copyright The Globe and Mail
