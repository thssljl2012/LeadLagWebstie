LOL, I realize that, but I found it interesting because I'm suprised that just one of the 27 entities that comprise Chemtura could fetch 700m to 1bn in proceeds from it's sale. Granted, it's probably one of the stronger entities in terms of value, but still after they achieve some liquidity through the sale of a few of their businesses/assets, I believe their will still be a decent portion of the overall company remaining. How much is anybody's guess, but it stands to reason that their stock will still have significant value.
