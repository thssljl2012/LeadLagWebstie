Buried as inaccurate. It&amp;#039;s the life insurance subsidiary of AIG, not the banking wing. They&amp;#039;re actually making money, so much so that AIG is looking at selling them off for some quick cash. That&amp;#039;s probably what the retreat was about. Still, a nasty display of largess when the economy is in the tank, but it&amp;#039;s not like they had anything to do with the failure of their parent company.
