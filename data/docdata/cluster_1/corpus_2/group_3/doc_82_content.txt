 UPdate!   This was not as it appears.     This was a contest won by Independent Isurance Agents who are not AIG employees.  They wrote life insurance for AIG companies and earned the trip.  This was earned by the agents over a year of writing life insurance.  To earn a trip like that one you got to write a whole lot of life insurance.  It was already earned and planed prior to the bail out.
