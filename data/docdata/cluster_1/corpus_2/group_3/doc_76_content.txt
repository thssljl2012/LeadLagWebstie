   QUOTE   And another question: if the top men were bold mavericks - why was there suddenly so much paranoia over Mortgage bonds that even the safe and reliable ones      Because good and bad mortgages were bundeled together bought, taken apart, rebundled to the point that no one knows what any of it is really worth.   On top of that, &amp;amp;quot;insurance&amp;amp;quot; was taken out on the bonds in case they failed in order to minimize risk. Of course they couldn&amp;#039;t call it insurance because if it was called insurance that would subject the insurer (AIG?) to federal regulations which requires the insurer to have some proportion of worth of the bond of real capital in case the bond failed. So they called it something different (and for the life of me I can&amp;#039;t remember what they called it), got around having to have the real tangible capital around and when the bonds crashed, they (AIG?) couldn&amp;#039;t cover the losses.   So AIG? couldn&amp;#039;t pay the losses it insured, then the banks/invetments firms are stuck with bonds of unknown worth and value and us taxpayers get to pay.   Viva la revolution.
