When lawmakers criticized Sullivan for urging AIG&amp;#039;s directors to waive pay guidelines to win a $5.0 million bonus for 2007  even as the company lost $5.0 billion in the fourth quarter of that year -- Sullivan countered that he was mainly concerned with helping other senior executives.                          Wait... Would you not make the same choice? Marty said he wanted to reward the insurance sector exec&amp;#039;s for their continued strong earnings SO THEY WONT QUIT! If you worked your but off and don&amp;#039;t get a bonus because some idiots in the Financial sector screwed up, wouldn&amp;#039;t you go somewhere else where you wouldn&amp;#039;t have to worry about not getting a bonus because another part of the company did bad? His intention was to keep them from leaving AIG. Imagine if the exec&amp;#039;s of the insurance sector left AIG and the earnings for the insurance side went down (or negative) for 2008. AIG would have no choice but to go bankrupt and with a bankrupt AIG &amp;amp;gt; the market will crash into a depression. I think Marty&amp;#039;s choice saved the company (&amp;amp;amp; possibly a larger crash in the market).
