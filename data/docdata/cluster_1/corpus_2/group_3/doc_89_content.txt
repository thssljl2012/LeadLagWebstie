   Scotiabank Pays C$2.3 Billion for CI Financial Stake       By Frederic Tomesco and Sean B. Pasternak             Oct. 6 (Bloomberg)  -- Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada&amp;#039;s third- biggest bank, agreed to buy Sun Life Financial Inc.&amp;#039;s stake in money manager CI Financial Income Fund for C$2.3 billion ($2.1 billion), the biggest acquisition in the bank&amp;#039;s 176-year history.      Scotiabank will pay C$22 a share in cash for a 37 percent stake in CI Financial, said Chris Hodgson, head of domestic banking, in a conference call today. That&amp;#039;s 32 percent higher than CI&amp;#039;s closing price on Oct. 3.      With the purchase, Scotiabank will become the largest shareholder of Toronto-based CI, the second-biggest mutual-fund company in Canada with about C$63 billion in assets. Scotiabank Chief Executive Officer Richard Waugh has said building the asset management business is one of the priorities for the bank.      ``It&amp;#039;s an opportunistic pick-up for Scotia,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Jeffery Lusher, a fund manager at BMO Harris Private Bank in Montreal, which oversees about C$2.1 billion and holds shares of Bank of Nova Scotia and Sun Life. ``They have a lot of capital, and stock prices have been trading lower in recent weeks, so the timing is good.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      Scotiabank fell C$2.16, or 4.6 percent, to C$45 at 4:15 p.m. trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Sun Life fell C$1.89, or 5.3 percent, to C$34.13. CI Financial fell 44 cents, or 2.6 percent, to C$16.20.      Investment Options      The transaction may allow Toronto-based Scotiabank to eventually buy all of CI, analysts such as Dundee Securities Corp.&amp;#039;s John Aiken said. Scotiabank may also sell its mutual fund operations to CI to save costs, as the Globe and Mail reported in August.      ``Scotia has a whole range of options open to them,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Aiken said in a phone interview. ``You&amp;#039;ve got that Sun Life stake, where you can take it out at your leisure. But why waste the capital on that when you&amp;#039;ve got other opportunities -- such as U.S. retail banking -- which you can get on the cheap?&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      Sun Life approached Scotiabank for the sale, which was completed over the weekend, Scotiabank said. Just last month, Sun Life executive Kevin Dougherty called CI one of Sun Life&amp;#039;s ``growth engines,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; and said the insurer was comfortable with its stake.      Asset Management      Scotiabank, which owns the smallest mutual-fund business among the country&amp;#039;s five main banks, is increasing its asset- management business through acquisitions. Last month, it purchased the Canadian operations of E*Trade Financial Corp. for about $442 million, doubling its domestic online-brokerage business. The bank bought 18 percent of Toronto-based money manager DundeeWealth Inc. last year.      The CI purchase will add about 4 cents a share to earnings in the first year, and 8 cents by the third year, Hodgson said on the call.      Sun Life, Canada&amp;#039;s third-biggest insurer, said the sale will give it more cash to buy assets amid the turmoil in the financial markets. Toronto-based Sun Life said last month it expects to report writedowns in the third-quarter on its investments in U.S. firms including American International Group Inc. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.      Sun Life CEO Donald Stewart said the sale wasn&amp;#039;t needed to raise capital for the Toronto-based firm, which ended the second quarter with about C$1 billion in excess capital. Sun Life will post a pretax gain of C$1.1 billion from the sale.      CI Value      ``Unlocking CI&amp;#039;s value now provides Sun Life with enhanced firepower to aggressively pursue our growth objectives,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Stewart said.      Stewart said the insurer is looking to expand its U.S. annuities and group insurance business, as well as Asia.      Andre-Philippe Hardy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, has said that Sun Life may look at AIG&amp;#039;s assets. AIG, the largest U.S. insurer by assets, has been forced to sell businesses to repay an $85 billion U.S. government loan. AIG may sell its U.S. life insurance and annuities units, people familiar with the situation said last week.      ``There are a lot of opportunities out there,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Stewart said. He declined to comment on AIG.      Sun Life may announce a transaction in the U.S. in the next 30 to 60 days, said Genuity Capital Markets analyst Mario Mendonca.
