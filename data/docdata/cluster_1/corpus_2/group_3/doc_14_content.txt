      I am a licensed life and health insurance saleman for almost 20 years, and there are alot of people talking in this thread who have no idea what they are talking about.        Falx, please stop expressing opinions about an industry you clearly do not understand.        When an independent agent has 150 life insurance companies in which to choose from in their state, the agent will look to sell the one that pays the best commission, has the highest ratings, and the most flexible product/underwriting etc.        AIG MUST reward those who sell its products the most, or they will cease to exist as an insurance carrier.        There are about 50 AIG insurance companies, one for each state.  THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the parent holding company who derivative-based holdings of MBS went bust.  In fact, if you read the statements from the NAIC, they were actually bragging about how well the AIG units were doing in their state.        Insurance is a complicated business, so please, if you don&amp;#039;t have experience in it, do not comment on esoteric businesses you are not familiar with.  You sound pretty foolish to those of us who actually ARE in the business.
