 FNM Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Aflac May Buy AIG&amp;#039;s Japan Life Unit, CEO Amos Says.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   Aflac Inc.   , the world&amp;#039;s largest seller of supplemental health insurance, may bid for    American International Group Inc.   &amp;#039;s Alico Japan life insurance unit, Chief Executive Officer    Daniel Amos    said.   Of the three life insurance businesses AIG is putting up for sale in Japan, Aflac is most interested in Alico because of the similarity of the products they offer, Amos said. Alico, with 1.47 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) of premium income, is Japan&amp;#039;s fifth-largest life insurer.      ``We&amp;#039;re investigating the possibility of bidding,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Amos, 57 , said in a Bloomberg Television interview in Tokyo on Oct. 10. ``Alico has been a competitor of ours for years, and we think Alico has a lot of potential in terms of an acquisition.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;     AIG said Oct. 3 it is seeking to sell life insurance and retirement businesses in the U.S., Europe, Latin America and Japan as it tries to repay an $85 billion loan extended by the U.S. government to keep the New-York based insurer, formerly the world&amp;#039;s largest, from collapsing. In addition to Alico, AIG is selling its AIG Edison Life Insurance Co. and AIG Star Life Insurance Co. units in Japan.     AIG&amp;#039;s Tokyo-based spokesman    Masato Kuroda    said today that nothing has been decided regarding the sale of the units.     Columbus, Georgia-based    Aflac    earns 70 percent of its revenue in Japan, according to Amos. He said Alico&amp;#039;s strengths include its distribution channels, including direct marketing, and Internet services.     Internet Sales     Nippon Life Insurance Co., Japan&amp;#039;s biggest life insurer, Tokio Marine Holdings Inc., the nation&amp;#039;s biggest casualty insurer, and    Allianz SE   , Germany&amp;#039;s biggest insurer, may also bid for AIG&amp;#039;s local units, according to    Keiko Mizuguchi   , chief analyst at Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd. in Tokyo.     ``For Japanese insurers, the business model that Alico has, which is using mail orders and Internet sales, is very attractive because it&amp;#039;s quite different from the traditional Japanese way of doing business,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Mizuguchi said. ``For Allianz, it will be a great opportunity to expand its overseas business.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;     Global insurers, like other institutional investors, are faced with    declining securities prices    amid the global credit crisis sparked by the collapse of the U.S. subprime market.     In Japan, 98-year-old    Yamato Life Insurance Co.    filed for court protection from creditors last week in the nation&amp;#039;s first bankruptcy by a life insurer in seven years, citing a decline in the value of investments. The Tokyo-based company&amp;#039;s debts totaled 269.5 billion yen.     `Strong Survive&amp;#039;     Aflac has boosted    profit    for six straight quarters and has declined 30 percent in New York trading this year, compared with a 42-percent decline in the seven-stock    S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 Life &amp;amp;amp; Health Insurance Index   .     What sets the company apart from competitors is its investment policy, Amos said. Its $60 billion portfolio has no investments in real estate, stocks, subprime mortgages or credit- default swaps, and instead is made up of bonds, 98 percent of which carry investment-grade ratings, he said.     Even so, the company owned about $256 million of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bonds as of June 30, which now hold no value, he said.     ``In life, certainly in business, the strong survive,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Amos said. ``Our model of being simple, straightforward in our investments will ultimately help us, in the long run.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;     If the company were to buy stocks, it might consider    Dai- ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co.   , Amos said. Dai-ichi Mutual, Japan&amp;#039;s second-biggest life insurer by assets, plans to sell more than 1 trillion yen worth of shares in an initial offering in 2010.
