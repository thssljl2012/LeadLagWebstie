Washington Mutual Final Debt Recovery Rate Below ExpectedLast  update: 10/23/2008 2:20:58 PMNEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Sellers of  credit protection on the default of Washington Mutual Inc. (WAMUQ)  will have to pay 43 cents on the dollar, according to the final  results of an auction to set the value of the failed bank&amp;#039;s debt.  The final price for the senior debt at Thursday&amp;#039;s auction was set  at 57 cents on the dollar. That&amp;#039;s below the 63.625-cent midpoint  gleaned from bids early in the day. Administrators Creditex and  Markit published the results of the auction on their Web site,  www.creditfixings.com, at 2:00 p.m. EDT. International Swaps and  Derivatives Association, an industry group, reported 519 parties  signed up to settle contracts under the terms of this auction,  including large international firms, troubled U.S. insurance giant  American International Group (AIG) and, in an interesting twist,  WaMu&amp;#039;s new owner, JP Morgan Chase (JPM). -By Emily Barrett, Dow  Jones Newswires
