I have LOC on all my IPs and another 2 LOCs not drawn down yet.  They are there just in case I need to use them for the next IP&amp;#039;s shortfall.   I have just read the CBA clauses.     LOC4.1 states:   We may reduce or cancel the credit limit on the Loan Account at any time.  And under defaults     9.1(c)  You are in default under the contract if  we are not satisfied with the value or the title to the Security Property, or both.   So if the worst happens and our props drop by 30%ish,  they may say this is in default.     They can take them then, and sell them and cancel the Loans??
