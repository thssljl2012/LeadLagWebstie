As I look at it, there is a good reason to have had this event, and to have not cancelled the upcoming event.  These are events for sales people. They&amp;#039;re designed to reqard them for top performance and to keep them loyal to the AIG brand and continue to sell it. Remember, they&amp;#039;re independent agents and can sell anyone&amp;#039;s insurance.  We, the taxpayers, loaned AIG $85 Billion at credit card rates. We need them to pay us back ASAP. To do so, AIG needs to sell off divisions including American General. AIG doesn&amp;#039;t manufacture anything, they don&amp;#039;t have inventory, they have people and relationships.  If AIG cancelled the event, a number of these agents would logically stop selling AIG and pick up another insurer. That would reduce the value of American General.  I say spend the $500K in order to get an additional $1B in value when the division is sold.
