Also, it looks like it was for employees of AIG American General, not AIG proper.  American General is an insurance company that AIG bought in 2001, and I think they should still be pretty profitable and generally untouched by this whole subprime mess.      I wouldn&amp;#039;t be surprised if American General is sold to somebody else or is spun off at some point ... they should really just operate business as usual while the broken parts of AIG try to right themselves.
