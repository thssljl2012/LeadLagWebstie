    Here is a great example of how trickle down economics doesn&amp;#039;t work.&amp;amp;nbsp; We&amp;#039;ve given AIG 85 billion--and their top sales folks went on a $450K boondoggle with part of it.  &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;  When the going gets tough, the tough get pedicures.  Just days after the federal government committed $85 billion of taxpayers&amp;#039; money to a bailout of insurance giant AIG last month, senior execs from the troubled company headed to Southern California&amp;#039;s ultra-swanky St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach for a week of wining and dining top salespeople.&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;* Just days before Lehman Bros. Holding Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection last month, the company altered its executive pay plan to give senior managers multimillion-dollar bonuses regardless of recent losses.&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; &amp;quot;They were the level of people who participate in such discussions,&amp;quot; Norton said, adding that resort holidays are &amp;quot;an industry practice to reward top producers.&amp;quot;   &amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I fully support rewarding success. But not failure. So I propose that boards cap a CEO&amp;#039;s base salary at no more than 10 times what the company&amp;#039;s average employee makes. Bonuses and other incentives would come on top of that amount.  However, those bonuses, including stock options, would be forfeited if the company lost money or if the share price fell by more than, say, 20%.  Moreover, all golden-parachute payouts would similarly vanish if a CEO or other senior exec leaves a company amid any form of distress, like a bankruptcy filing, for instance.  If these guys are truly worth their multimillion-dollar paychecks, such performance-based compensation should be no problem.&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;  Well, I have some new industry practices to propose.&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;   http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lazarus8-2008oct08,0,5596966.column                Wolfsong        If you loved the last 8 years, vote McCain.&amp;amp;nbsp; Otherwise, OBAMA 08!
