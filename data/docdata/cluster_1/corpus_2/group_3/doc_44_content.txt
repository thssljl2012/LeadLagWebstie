A mere $38 billion more in welfare for Maddox &amp;amp;amp; Co. If he buys the Phillies next year, I&amp;#039;m going to smell a rat!             Quote:                         The Federal Reserve Board said Wednesday that it would provide up to an additional $37.8 billion to the insurance giant, the American International Group, to help the company deal with a continuing liquidity crisis.      The additional funds come atop $85 billon in credit that the Federal Reserve Board extended to A.I.G. about two weeks ago, just as the current financial crisis was unfolding. At the time, the bailout of A.I.G. was the most radical intervention ever by the central bank in a public company.      The money comes one day after two of A.I.G.s former executives, Martin J. Sullivan and Robert B. Willumstad, answered critical questions from lawmakers about business and pay practices and outsize spending after the initial lifeline from the government. One particular point of contention during the hearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee was a weeklong retreat that a life insurance subsidiary, AIG General, held for its top sales agents at the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif. The $442,000 in expenses included $150,000 for food and $23,000 in spa charges, according to documents obtained by the committee.      Joe Norton, A.I.G.s director of public relations, said in an interview that the event had been scheduled last year, though he did not know whether executives had considered canceling the retreat after the bailout.
