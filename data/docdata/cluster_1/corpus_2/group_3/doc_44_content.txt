 FNM Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 2              Ex-Safeco CEO to lead AIG restructuring.    BLOOMBERG NEWS    American International Group Inc. has named former Safeco CEO Paula Rosput Reynolds to lead the insurer&amp;#039;s restructuring six months after she arranged the sale of Safeco Corp.    Reynolds joins AIG as the firm tries to sell units to repay the $82.9 billion it has drawn down from an emergency Federal Reserve credit line. Reynolds was chief executive of Safeco, the Seattle-based insurer, when she sold the company to Liberty Mutual Group Inc. for $6.2 billion, 51 percent more than the closing share price before the deal was announced.                                        &amp;amp;nbsp;                                                       &amp;amp;nbsp;                Reynolds                            &amp;quot;Paula brings to AIG deep experience, not only as an insurance industry leader, but also as someone who has successfully realigned organizations to meet new challenges,&amp;quot; Liddy said in a news release Wednesday.    AIG agreed last month to turn over 80 percent of the company to the U.S. in exchange for the federal loan after credit downgrades and three quarterly losses tied to the U.S. housing market totaling more than $18 billion. Liddy said Wednesday on PBS&amp;#039; &amp;quot;The NewsHour With Jim Lehrer&amp;quot; that the $122.8 billion made available by the government may not be enough.    Liddy is selling businesses including U.S. life insurance, plane leasing and consumer finance. He helped oversee the spinoffs of insurer Allstate Corp., Discover Financial Services, real estate broker Coldwell Banker Corp. and securities brokerage Dean Witter when he was an executive at Sears Roebuck &amp;amp;amp; Co.     Reynolds, 52, spent 20 years in the energy business before being named Safeco&amp;#039;s CEO in January 2006.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    She arranged Safeco&amp;#039;s sale after the company dropped about 32 percent in 12 months.      &amp;quot;A timely sale at a great price, and she deserves kudos for that,&amp;quot; KBW Inc. analyst Cliff Gallant said last spring. &amp;quot;She put shareholders first, and I think a lot of shareholders wish all CEOs were like that.&amp;quot;     Richard Booth, AIG&amp;#039;s chief administrative officer, has been named vice chairman of transition planning, the insurer said.
