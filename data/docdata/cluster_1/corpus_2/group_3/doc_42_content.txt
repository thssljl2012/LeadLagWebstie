Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) said today at the the opening of a House committee hearing about the near-failure of the insurance giant.      Showing a photograph of the resort, Waxman said the executives spent $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 for the spa.      &amp;amp;quot;Less than a week after the taxpayers rescued AIG, company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation,&amp;amp;quot; Waxman said. &amp;amp;quot;We will ask whether any of this makes sense. &amp;amp;quot;                                  Still think bailouts are sometimes necessary?
