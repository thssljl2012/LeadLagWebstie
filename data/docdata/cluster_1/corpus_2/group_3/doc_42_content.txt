They are one company when it actually counts, like when discussing the bottom line.                      We can agree to disagree, but the company did NOT use bailout tax dollars on the retreat and the executives responsible for the AIG failure/bailout had nothing to do with the spending of AIG Insurance Corp profits on an employee bonus. I just don&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;s relevant to the bailout.    Even if it were relevant, $440k is only a fraction of a percent of the total $85 billion.
