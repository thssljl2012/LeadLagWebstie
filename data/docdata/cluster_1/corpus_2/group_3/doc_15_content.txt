  While the states regulate AIG&amp;#039;s insurance companies, I still would shy away from holding an AIG policy. If the @#$ hits the fan, the holding company will roll up the cash from the insurance companies and stop doing business. Once the cash is gone, even the state insurance departments can&amp;#039;t get it back...except for the small amounts deposited with the state.   The holding company cannot do this. Generally, every &amp;quot;dividend&amp;quot; or cash infusion paid by an insurance company to a parent or affiliated companymust be approved PRIOR to payment by the state in which the insurance company is domiciled. There is sometimes a distinction made between ordinary and extraordinary dividends, which is based on the size of the company and the payment, but what you are talking about here is definitely extraordinary and would be forbidden.If any company tried to raid a subsidiary insurer for cash, especially in New York which is a very strict state, the insurance department would be in court taking over the insurance company.       I don&amp;#039;t think the average consumer is aware of how strictly regulated insurance companies are (although some states are better than others, and insolvencies do happen). The #1 concern for insurance regulators is insuring that the company stays financially solvent and able to pay its claims.       Insurance companies are heavy investors in mortgage pool tranches. This is true and a good point. I&amp;#039;m interested to see what kind of new disclosures the regulators come up with to report these investments and the associated risks/writedowns.
