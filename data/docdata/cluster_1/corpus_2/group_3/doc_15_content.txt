Typical. Pretty much all of you - and the entire media - went full retard on this one, hook line and sinker. Got Obama?  Let&amp;#039;s take a breath, people. There were NO AIG EXECUTIVES at the retreat, zip zero none. In fact, there were only 10 AIG employees present! The other ~100 attendees were independent agents (salesmen that sell many insurance carrier products, not employed by AIG) being rewarded for selling AIG life insurance over the past year. This expense was priced into the cost of the product as part of their commission these salespeople receive for selling life insurance. If AIG decided not to compensate its top sales people for their performance, the insurance division, one of AIG&amp;#039;s most successful, stable, and profitable, would tank next year, and guess who&amp;#039;d take the financial hit now that Uncle Sam owns? Hmmm. Full retard, indeed.   http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20081008-90520 ...
