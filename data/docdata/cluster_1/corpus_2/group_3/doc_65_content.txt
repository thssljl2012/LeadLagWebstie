    therestillis:  I&amp;#039;m against the $85,000,000,000.00 bailout of AIG.  If we didn&amp;#039;t bailout AIG, many companies wouldn&amp;#039;t have received their insurance payments from the CDS(Credit default swap) contracts they entered. This means their asset values would decrease and they would be insolvent.
