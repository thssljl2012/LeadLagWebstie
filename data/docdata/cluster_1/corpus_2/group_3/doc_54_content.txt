Don&amp;#039;t let the facts get in the way of your Minute of Hate.   - Tax dollars are not involved with AIG.   - The Fed made a high interest loan to AIG that is collateralized. Around $120 billion in loans at Libor + 6 to a company with a trillion in assets. This loan will allow them to liquidate the assets necessary to pay back the loan and the interest - over time at reasonable prices - rather than in a fire sale that would have forced AIG to go bankupt and caused worldwide chaos.   - Chaos like no more commercial flights anywhere since AIG insures 90% of the commercial airplanes in the world. And they don&amp;#039;t fly with no insurance.   - No AIG executives were on this trip. It was held for outside insurance sales agents. If AIG is ever going to get its footing back, it depends on keeping the small businessmen and women outside the company who sell it&amp;#039;s products happy.   - Obama needs to be fired for demogauging something he doesn&amp;#039;t understand, and so should all the nitwits at Fox News who are doing the same thing (Bill O&amp;#039;Rielly and Bill Hemmer - I&amp;#039;m looking at you assholes).
