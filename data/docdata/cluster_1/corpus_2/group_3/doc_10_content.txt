If AIG can show that they earned business in excess of the expenditure, at least they can claim a return on investment. Otherwise, it&amp;#039;s a waste of money that should have been used to shore up their weak asset structure.   3) The government now owns approximately 80% of the company. It&amp;#039;s no longer &amp;amp;quot;government interference&amp;amp;quot; but rather an activist shareholder.   4) I read somewhere that they&amp;#039;ve already burned through in excess of $60B of the $85B loan. Something tells me we&amp;#039;re never going to see that money again.

Maybe, maybe not, but when you have new owners, sometimes you have new rules. Whether or not it&amp;#039;s new, it&amp;#039;s still taking advantage.
