  Still waiting for the final story, but tallskier is probably correct about the event  that it was not for AIG execs.  But, sorry, I disagree with you, tallskier, theres much to see here.  AIGs Board of Directors should have known better and they should have acted with some sympathy for their financial meltdown  and this was exactly what their former CEO, Robert Willumstad, said in his recent House deposition.  CNN reported that the retreat didnt include anyone from the financial products division that nearly drove AIG under, but lawmakers still were enraged over thousands of dollars spent on outing for executives of AIGs main U.S. life insurance subsidiary.  (That subsidiary being AIG American General, which is based in Houston, TX.)  As a former sales exec, I know quite a bit about rewarding top performers and I am well aware of non-sales employees who viewed us with enmity as we were awarded all-expense paid weekends and vacations.  I can justify such perks to my own satisfaction when the company is doing well, but doing business as usual when your company has just accepted an $85 Billion bailout?!?  What were they thinking?  F*** the average citizen cause I made quota and deserve this?!?  Or were they oblivious to what was happening with the bailout?!?  To me, not only is this an example of continued corporate excess, but a perfect example of our lawmakers ineptitude!         What exactly did our $85 Billion do for insurance and financial giant AIG?  As Forbes lists them as the 18th largest company in the world, do they spread that wealth among all of their divisions in the 7 or so countries that they do business?  New CEO Liddy, like Lucy, got some explaining to do!
