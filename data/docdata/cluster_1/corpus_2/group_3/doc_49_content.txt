For some reason, people freak out when talk turns to any sort of assistance to one of the nations largest direct and indirect employers.  Every last dime of GM&amp;#039;s debt could be wiped out for about $50 Billion.  Contrast that to the $123 Billion given SO FAR to AIG.  And that&amp;#039;s in addition to the $700 Billion for the bankers who f&amp;#039;d up.        Yup. I&amp;#039;d rather have the banks all fail and spend a trillion on manufacturing in this country if given a choice.                        I shudder to think what would have happened if AIG went down. AIG is one of the biggest insurance companies in the world. If all its insurance contracts became null and void, financial institutions across the country would suddenly have massive open exposure. The consumer impact would be disastrous, too. What of medical insurance, life insurance, auto insurance underwritten by AIG? There would be huge loss of consumer confidence in the insurance industry. Given the turmoil in the financial sector there was no acquirer that could have rescued AIG in time.      Taxpayers would not need to foot the bill to rescue GM if a stronger foreign automaker were to acquire the company. Toyota? Honda? Maybe even Tata?
