To get a buyer, those life companies have to keep up their agents&amp;#039; contracts as well as their insurance policies. To keep up the value, the agents have to keep selling. The &amp;amp;quot;live it up&amp;amp;quot; retreat was earned by the agents. The policies they sold (and will sell in the future) are the collateral for the $85b loan. If we shut down the agents and their paid-for retreats, we can kiss our $85b good-bye. Let&amp;#039;s not cut off our nose to spite our face.     That&amp;#039;s a misrepresentation! They partied while part of the $2 trillion dollars in pensions went up in smoke. Do you think these &amp;#039;agents&amp;#039; sold primarily life insurance? They partied while peoples savings went up in smoke and those will NOT BE RECOVERED!  Looky here!  http://www.aigretirement.com/AIG-Retirement_8...
