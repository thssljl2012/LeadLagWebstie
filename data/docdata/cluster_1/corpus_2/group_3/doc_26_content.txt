Lets say its a Job my husband would never want to have, as its sales. Some of my friends here husband&amp;#039;s work for companies that receive simular incentives. I know one is going to Puerta Vallerta, Mexico this year.         Diane G-----not everything reported on the news is gold                       Waxman also said there is evidence the two men changed the bonus schedule once the company began to post losses, so that executives under the &amp;amp;quot;Senior Partners Plan&amp;amp;quot; would continue to make multi-million dollar salaries.       &amp;amp;quot;Mr. Sullivan and the other top executives should have had their bonuses slashed due to poor performance,&amp;amp;quot; said Waxman.       Sullivan said it was &amp;amp;quot;substantially reduced&amp;amp;quot; by the board in 2007 due to poor performance.       Sullivan was given a $15 million &amp;amp;quot;golden parachute&amp;amp;quot; payment after being replaced as CEO in June.         http://a.abcnews.com/Blotter/Story?id=5973452&amp;amp;amp;page=2          Whatever at the very least it was very poor timing on their part and will not endear Joe Taxpayer to them....
