The St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, was the site of a week-long luxury retreat for executives of the AIG insurance company, who headed there less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out the company.   (ABC News Photo Illustration)&amp;quot;Rooms at this resort can cost over $1,000 a night,&amp;quot; Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) said this morning as his committee continued its investigation of Wall Street and its CEOs.       AIG documents obtained by Waxman&amp;#039;s investigators show the company paid more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges.       &amp;quot;Their getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that,&amp;quot; said Cong. Elijah Cummings(D-MD).       AIG CEO Robert Willumstad and former CEO Martin Sullivan are both scheduled to testify today.       &amp;quot;Mr. Sullivan and the other top executives should have had their bonuses slashed due to poor performance,&amp;quot; said Waxman.          Congressional investigators also raised question of whether AIG executives sough to &amp;quot;cook the books&amp;quot; and hide negative information from outside auditors.       On Dec. 5, 2007, Waxman said, CEO Sullivan told investors &amp;quot;we are confident in our marks and the reasonableness of our valuation methods.&amp;quot;       Documents obtained by the committee show that one week earlier, auditors Pricewaterhouse Cooper had &amp;quot;raise their concerns with Mr. Sullivaninforming him that PWC believed that AIG could have a material weakness relating to the risk management of these areas.&amp;quot;       Click Here for the Investigative Homepage.                     This makes me absolutely livid. My car insurance is through AIG and I am seriously considering cancelling that policy and switching to another.
