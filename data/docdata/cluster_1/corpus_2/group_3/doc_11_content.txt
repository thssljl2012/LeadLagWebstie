                 After Bailout, AIG Execs Head to California Resort          quote:   Originally posted by:  MegaRock    &amp;quot;Dirtbags&amp;quot;     Less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, Congressional investigators revealed today.       &amp;quot;Rooms at this resort can cost over $1,000 a night,&amp;quot; Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) said this morning as his committee continued its investigation of Wall Street and its CEOs.       AIG documents obtained by Waxman&amp;#039;s investigators show the company paid more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges.       &amp;quot;They&amp;#039;re getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that,&amp;quot; said Cong. Elijah Cummings (D-MD).       &amp;quot;This unbridled greed,&amp;quot; said Cong. Mark Souder (R-IN), &amp;quot;it&amp;#039;s an insensitivity to how people are spending our dollars.&amp;quot;       Appearing before the committee, Martin Sullivan, the AIG CEO until June, said the company was overwhelmed by a &amp;quot;financial global tsunami,&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;no simple or single cause&amp;quot; was to blame.       http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter
