 This was from a very productive and profitable  division of AIG that sold regular insurance products through a network of independent insurance agents. This was an annual &amp;#039;meeting&amp;#039; thrown for the independent (Not AIG employees) agents.      Timing is horrible, they deserve the bad press.  But it&amp;#039;s normal business as stated above, and the beneficiaries were the independent agents, not just executives.    It was a seperate division of AIG that got into deep kim-chi with Credit Default Swaps that tanked the balance sheet (but not their profitable businesses).    Also, the Gov bought 80% of AIG, including their considerable assets, for pennies on the dollar.  They weren&amp;#039;t just given money.  Unraveling their Credit default Swap business will be a chore, but that ownership stake will likely profit to taxpayers, IMHO.       Still an ugly affair.
