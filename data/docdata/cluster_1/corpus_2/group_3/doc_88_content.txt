The news reporter is either lying or ignorant about this being a retreat only for AIG Executives. The politicians are lying to make themselves look good to their voters back home. Apparently, this was a sales incentive reward for the top INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS. This is how business is done in American Insurance Industry. Its done by all other major insurance carriers as well. Its probably in the best interests of AIG Life to continue these events if they want independent sales agents to sell their products.  BTW, I heard today that AIG plans to sell-off its American General Life Insurance subsidiary to help repay the line of credit.
