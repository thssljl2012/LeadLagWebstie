                    AIG executives spent thousands during hunting trip                                      More from the GOP &amp;#039;Let them eat Cake crowd&amp;#039;!....          AIG executives spent thousands during hunting trip       By  IEVA M. AUGSTUMS  &amp;amp;#8211; 20 hours ago       CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) &amp;amp;#8212; A handful of top executives from American International Group Inc. spent thousands of dollars during a recent English hunting trip, even as the New York-based insurer asked for an additional $37.8 billion loan from the Federal Reserve.      The news comes as New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday told the insurance giant to do away with golden parachutes for executives, golf outings and parties while taking government money to stay afloat.      Cuomo said he has the power under state business law to review and possibly rescind any inappropriate AIG spending as long as the Federal Reserve is propping up the huge insurer with almost $123 billion in loans announced since Sept. 16.      &amp;amp;quot;This was an annual event for customers of the AIG property casualty insurance companies in the U.K. and Europe, and planned months before the Federal Reserve Bank of New York&amp;#039;s loan to AIG,&amp;amp;quot; company spokesman Peter Tulupman said Wednesday morning.      In a prepared statement later in the day, the company said, &amp;amp;quot;We will continue to take all measures necessary to ensure that these activities cease immediately. AIG&amp;#039;s priority is to continue focusing on actions necessary to repay the Federal Reserve loan and emerge as a vital, ongoing business.&amp;amp;quot;      AIG officials declined to say which AIG executives attended the trip, which reports have said racked up an $86,000 tab. News of the hunting trip surfaced just days after AIG received an additional $37.8 billion loan from the Federal Reserve, on top of a previous $85 billion emergency loan granted last month.      The company said last week it would stop &amp;amp;quot;all non-essential conferences, meetings and activities that do not clearly maximize value and service given the current conditions.&amp;amp;quot;      Last month, and just days after the U.S. government stepped in to save AIG with a $85 billion taxpayer-funded loan, the company picked up a $440,000 tab for a week-long retreat at a posh California resort for top-performing insurance agents.      Lawmakers investigating AIG&amp;#039;s meltdown said they were enraged that executives of AIG&amp;#039;s main U.S. life insurance subsidiary spent a lavish amount on the retreat, complete with spa treatments, banquets and golf outings. Last week, White House Press Secretary Dana Perino called the event &amp;amp;quot;despicable.&amp;amp;quot;      At that time, AIG issued a statement saying that the &amp;amp;quot;business event&amp;amp;quot; was planned months before the Sept. 16 bailout and that it was held for top-producing independent life insurance agents, not AIG employees. Of the 100 attendees, only 10 worked for the AIG unit hosting the event, it said.      The insurer said Chief Executive Edward Liddy sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson &amp;amp;quot;clarifying the circumstances&amp;amp;quot; of the event. In the letter, Liddy assured Paulson that AIG is &amp;amp;quot;reevaluating the costs of all aspects of our operations in light of the new circumstances in which we are all operating.&amp;amp;quot;      The insurer then said it canceled a future California retreat that was to be held later this month.      Regarding the recent hunting trip, &amp;amp;quot;We regret that this event was not canceled,&amp;amp;quot; Tulupman said Wednesday.      Shares of AIG fell 37 cents, or 13.2 percent, to $2.43 in trading Wednesday.                                      __________________                I&amp;#039;ll probably say it three more times, see, in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over again for the truth to sink in, to kinda catapult the propaganda.
