                                                  It couldn&amp;#039;t be that the price of oil on the commodities market has dropped like a rock and caused gas to also drop in price.      And you do know that there wasn&amp;#039;t suppose to be any exec&amp;#039;s there, it was attended by AIG&amp;#039;s top independent salesmen as a award for having a good year for the Company.        quote:  American International Group, Inc. (AIG) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Edward M. Liddy sent a letter today to U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson to clarify the circumstances of a business event held by an AIG subsidiary which was discussed during an October 7, 2008 hearing by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.       The event, mischaracterized as an &amp;quot;Executive Retreat,&amp;quot; was held by one of AIG&amp;#039;s insurance subsidiaries for independent life insurance agents, not for AIG employees. These agents were top business producers for the company, and of the more than 100 attendees, only 10 were employees of the AIG subsidiary who were there to represent their company. No AIG executives from headquarters attended. The meeting was planned months before the Federal Reserve Bank of New York&amp;#039;s loan to AIG.
