                                                                   optics are not great, but yeah, being in the industry, this is standard practice. I have gone on a couple of &amp;quot;reward&amp;quot; trips as a result of my business.     Also, one thing to keep in mind, AIG&amp;#039;s woes have nothing to do with the insurance business. It is sound and in high demand with the many other financial companies in the world, including Canada&amp;#039;s Sun Life and Manulife, both of whom would LOVE to get their hands on the Asian and Canadian Insurance arms especially.    AIG just got caught too deep in the commercial paper fiasco.
