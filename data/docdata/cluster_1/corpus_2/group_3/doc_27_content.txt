           Quote:        Quote:     Originally posted by Tea_Honey    The Fed announced on September 16 that it was giving an $85 billion loan to American International Group (AIG) for a nearly 80% stake in the mega-insurer.                  From The Week news magazine of 10/17/08:      AIG, the global insurance giant showed its gratitude for the $85 billion bailout provided by taxpayers by staging a weeklong retreat for sales agents and executives at a California resort, running up a tab of $440,000 for luxury rooms, banquets, massages, and other spa treatments. A spokesman said the retreat was a &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; way of rewarding top performers.            What a disgrace
