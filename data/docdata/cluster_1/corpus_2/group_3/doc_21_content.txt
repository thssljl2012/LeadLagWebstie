 I work for AIG and all of the above is way off line. First, the report that we were going to lend ourselves money was inaccurate. AIG was going to ask it&amp;#039;s insurance subsidiaries for 20 billion in cash in exchange for $20 billion in less liquid assets. Thankfully that did not need to happen due to the feds coming in.&amp;amp;nbsp;Second,&amp;amp;nbsp;AIG is not a bank,&amp;amp;nbsp;at the core we are majorily an insurance company with a small financial services section that got the company into trouble with the mortgage backed securities&amp;amp;nbsp;that are causing havoc across all areas of the market at this time. Third, the insurance&amp;amp;nbsp;parts of&amp;amp;nbsp;AIG,&amp;amp;nbsp;which make up 85% of AIG&amp;#039;s gross earnings, are wholly owned subsidiaries of AIG&amp;amp;nbsp;and are not and will not be affected by the&amp;amp;nbsp;goings on of AIG going forward so anyone that has their car insurance through AIG Direct, formerly 21st Century, will continue to have a policy and will not all of a sudden be&amp;amp;nbsp;dropped and have to scramble for coverage. Insurance is regulated on a state by state basis and there is no&amp;amp;nbsp;way that policyholders are going to be left holding the bag.&amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  There was just an announcement today that&amp;amp;nbsp;AIG will be&amp;amp;nbsp;going back to it&amp;#039;s core businesses of Property Casualty and life insurance. So I think the worst is behind us and the fed loan will be paid off by summer of next year at the latest. The one thing that we as employees did not realize is that even after the fed loan is repaid, the feds will still own 79.9% of AIG. So that just shows you how dire the situation was if they agreed to that in order to get their hands on the capital. There is a lot more that is involved but the main thing is that if you are a policyholder you are safe and if you have a claim it will be paid.
