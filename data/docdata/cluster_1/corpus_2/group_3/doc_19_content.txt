Not to rush against the Digg crowd or anything... but ya&amp;#039;ll did read the article, and some of the articles about AIG before this, right?  The executives didn&amp;#039;t go to this retreat.  The people who *did* go to this retreat were the employees... the high dollar earners, as a reward for their hard work...  And their hard work was for the *insurance* side of AIG, which is doing quite well.  The next one will be for the *insurance* employees again, with (IIRC) no executives in attendance.  If AIG Insurance is to survive, they need to continue treating their employees properly.  Otherwise, these high dollar insurance hustlers will take their clients elsewhere.  This is one of their &amp;quot;perks&amp;quot;, if you will.
