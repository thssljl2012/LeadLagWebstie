No, I&amp;#039;m not a salesman. And I&amp;#039;m not connected to AIG in any way, nor had I heard of this retreat until the news exploded. But I&amp;#039;ve done actuarial work for such companies for decades.  The retreat didnt include anyone from the financial products division that nearly drove AIG under. If AIG had cut off the agents&amp;#039; convention, which the agents had already paid for by selling AIG insurance, the agents would have left for greener pastures. That would leave the company with no future (and no value), and the taxpayers to swallow the $85b.  It&amp;#039;s a good thing the folks upset with the retreat aren&amp;#039;t running AIG.
