Seriously, its time to start shooting these people. Trials are expensive.                      I am making ZERO excuses for the execs that spent that money but this is what I don&amp;#039;t understand - why weren&amp;#039;t federal regulators cranking the vice down in every room of every office and on every exec in the company after the 85 billion?      On a side note - what people also need to understand is that AIG&amp;#039;s 85 billion bailout HAS to be paid back in full to the Govt. and therefore, to the tax payer.  So before you get up in arms because your tax dollars went into some massages, understand that the 85 billion came with the strict stipulation that AIG would break up and sell assets, equity and anything it could to repay that emergency loan.
