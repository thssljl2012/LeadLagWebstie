AIG stops all activities not essential to business   &amp;amp;nbsp;  (AIG)    by Sue Chang                                        &amp;amp;nbsp;                                             SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- American Insurance Group ( AIG )              said late Wednesday it has received a letter from New York Attorney              General Andrew Cuomo&amp;#039;s office regarding a probe into the company&amp;#039;s              expenditure and said it will cooperate fully. &amp;quot;On October 10, we issued              a clear directive ending all activities that are not essential to the              conduct of our business. We will continue to take all measures              necessary to ensure that these activities cease immediately,&amp;quot; said AIG              in a statement. The insurance giant said its priority remains focused              on repaying billions in Federal Reserve loan and emerging as a vital,              ongoing business. Cuomo&amp;#039;s office said earlier it launched a probe into              allegedly &amp;quot;unwarranted and outrageous expenditures&amp;quot; at AIG in light of              the support the insurance giant received from the U.S. government.
