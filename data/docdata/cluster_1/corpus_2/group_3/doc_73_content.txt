Well, they&amp;#039;re still at it. Now they&amp;#039;re taking $86,000 hunting trips in England! And this is AFTER the Treasury allegedly got 80% ownership of AIG. These guys have no shame. They&amp;#039;re getting a massage and manicure in Southern California and hunting trips in England and the American taxpayers are getting screwed.     I heard something extremely scary about AIG on CNBC this morning. One of their Wall Street types was saying that  we have &amp;amp;quot;no idea just how deep a black hole&amp;amp;quot; AIG is going to turn out to be . The number he threw out there was $500 billion! That&amp;#039;s what he claims is the total amount of default-swaps and other crap that AIG has written insurance on. OMG! I sure hope he&amp;#039;s exaggerating!      It has been know for years now that all of these guys are lying. They have been lying because they knew that Bush&amp;#039;s appointees had no intention of cracking down on them. All of the regulatory agencies were filled with Bush appointees who had previously worked as lobbyists representing the industries they were now supposed to regulate. CHARLOTTE, North Carolina - First there was the $440,000 American Insurance Group Inc. spent entertaining executives days after receiving an $85 billion lifeline from the Federal Reserve, now it&amp;amp;#8217;s $86,000 for a hunting trip in England as the faltering company reaped another $37.8 billion in taxpayer funded loans.     News of the hunting trip emerged Wednesday as New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ordered AIG to do away with golden parachutes for executives, golf outings and parties while taking government money to stay afloat.     &amp;amp;#8220;Even after the taxpayer-funded bailout of AIG, the company paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for luxurious retreats for its executives, including an overseas hunting party and a golf outing,&amp;amp;#8221; Cuomo wrote in a letter to the New York-based insurer.                              AIG Has Used Much of Its $123 Billion Bailout Loan           Please sir   ,  can   I   we have some more?   The troubled insurance giant American International Group already has consumed three-quarters of a federal $123 billion rescue loan, a little more than a month after the government stepped in to save the company from bankruptcy.     AIG has borrowed $90.3 billion from the Federal Reserve&amp;#039;s credit line as of yesterday, the bulk of it to pay off bad bets the company made in guaranteeing other firms&amp;#039; risky mortgage investments. That&amp;#039;s up from roughly $83 billion AIG had borrowed a week ago, and the $68 billion level it reached a week before that. The news comes as  the company&amp;#039;s new chief executive warned Wednesday that the government&amp;#039;s financial lifeline may not be enough to keep AIG afloat .
