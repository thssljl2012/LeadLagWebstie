   I received a letter regarding one of my Disability policies that goes through AIG. It explained that the monetary reserves are there, and quite sufficient to handle potential claims. This is how insurance companies are required to work - they must keep monies based on actuarial estimates present to pay claims.       Insurance companies are heavy investors in mortgage pool tranches.
