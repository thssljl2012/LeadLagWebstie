 What, only $23,000 in Spa services...they screwed up             http://voices.washingtonpost.com/liv...l?hpid=topnews             Less than a week after the federal government offered an $85 billion bailout to insurance giant AIG, the company held a week-long retreat for its executives at the luxury St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif., running up a tab of $440,000, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) said today at the the opening of a House committee hearing about the near-failure of the insurance giant.       Showing a photograph of the resort, Waxman said the executives spent $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 for the spa.       &amp;amp;quot;Less than a week after the taxpayers rescued AIG, company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation,&amp;amp;quot; Waxman said. &amp;amp;quot;We will ask whether any of this makes sense. &amp;amp;quot;      The committee will ask the company&amp;#039;s executives about their multimillion-dollar pay packages -- some of which they continue to receive -- as well as who bears responsibility for the company&amp;#039;s high-risk investment portfolio, which led to its near collapse just weeks ago.       &amp;amp;quot;They were getting their manicures, their pedicures, massages, their facials while the American people were paying their bills,&amp;amp;quot; thundered Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), of the executive retreat at the Monarch Resort
