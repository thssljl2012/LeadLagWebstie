It looks like AIG&amp;#039;s asset sales could be in trouble due to the economic climate. AIG&amp;#039;s restructuring may have stalled because potential buyers are having a hard time financing deals, according to   Reuters  .                                                                             Many media reports suggested that AIG&amp;#039;s asset sale would be a   fire sale  , but it has become more like rubbing two sticks together and waiting for a spark. The government has already increased AIG&amp;#039;s $85 billion in bailout financing to $123 billion. As more time passes, the struggling company will be under more pressure to sell its assets at discount prices or seek additional financing in order to survive.                                       The company has been under tremendous pressure to trim back its excessive spending. The Federal Reserve said AIG had borrowed $82.9 billion out of its $122.8 billion in credit available from the central bank. A week earlier, AIG showed $70.3 billion in total borrowing.                                       This week  New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo  sat down with CEO Edward Liddy to   trim down   several expenditures including eliminating a March 2008 cash bonus of $5 million to former C EO Martin Sullivan  and a &amp;quot;golden parachute&amp;quot; of $15 million as well as departing CFO Steven Bensinger&amp;#039;s severance package of about $10 million.  The New York insurer also has canceled more than 160 conferences and events costing more than $750,000, for a total savings of more than $8 million, according to the press release.                                       On top of that next week  AIG will institute a Special Governance Committee with new expense management controls and a brand new &amp;quot;Expense Policy Guidebook.&amp;quot; Chances are that the new CFO  David Herzog will be managing or involved in the new board. He also has the grueling task of having to figure out how AIG will pay off its $122.8 billion loan. And how will he do that? Well, for starters, through selling AIG&amp;#039;s assets.  Blackstone Group LP and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;amp;amp; Co. are advising AIG on its asset disposals.                                       Here&amp;#039;s what has been sold so far:                                            AIG Highstar Capital II LP has sold a 50% stake in Dutch utility InterGen NV to Bangalore, India, private sector infrastructure developer GMR Infrastructure Ltd. AIG Highstar said it would sell its InterGen stake to GMR in June for $1.1 billion.                         The insurer has already sold its 50% stake in London City Airport Ltd. to its joint venture partner, Global Infrastructure Partners, for an estimated $460 million.
