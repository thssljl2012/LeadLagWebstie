  http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5973452&amp;amp;amp;page=1       Excerpts from much longer story posted ^:       Less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, Congressional investigators revealed today.       Two AIG CEOs testify to Congress about their use of taxpayer bailout money.&amp;amp;quot;Rooms at this resort can cost over $1,000 a night,&amp;amp;quot; Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) said this morning as his committee continued its investigation of Wall Street and its CEOs.       AIG documents .  .  .  show the company paid more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges.       &amp;amp;quot;They&amp;#039;re getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that,&amp;amp;quot; said Cong. Elijah Cummings (D-MD).       &amp;amp;quot;This unbridled greed,&amp;amp;quot; said Cong. Mark Souder (R-IN), &amp;amp;quot;it&amp;#039;s an insensitivity to how people are spending our dollars.&amp;amp;quot;           Hmmm, a Republican and a couple of Democrats --  all three expressing some form of outrage or at least aggravation.  Oh, that&amp;#039;s right;  they&amp;#039;re House members, so presumably all up for (re-)election.
