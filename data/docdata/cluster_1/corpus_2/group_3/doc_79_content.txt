It wasn&amp;#039;t the AIG executives. It was the top salesmen from the insurance division, which is actually a profitable subsidiary. It was a reward that had been planned for over a year. It&amp;#039;s not like AIG executives took the government bailout money and spent it on a trip. Sure, it&amp;#039;s probably inappropriate given the circumstances, but it&amp;#039;s really not a big deal.
