[-The US Federal Reserve stepped in to save American International Group [AIG] from imminent collapse on September 16, with a loan that gave the US government a stake of 79.9 percent in the insurance behemoth in the deal.  &amp;amp;quot;Less than one week later, AIG held a week-long retreat for company executives at the exclusive St. Regis resort in Monarch Beach, California,&amp;amp;quot; Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Tuesday.  Invoices showed that AIG paid the Pacific Ocean getaway resort more than 440,000 dollars, Waxman told the committee on its second day of hearings on the Wall Street economic crisis.  The charges included close to 200,000 dollars for rooms -- which cost between 425 and 1,200 dollars per night -- over 150,000 for meals and 23,000 in spa charges, he said. -]  And guess what fellow taxpaying Amurricans?
