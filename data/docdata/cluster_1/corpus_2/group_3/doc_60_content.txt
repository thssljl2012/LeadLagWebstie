We&amp;#039;re going to Disney World!           Quote:                         Less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, Congressional investigators revealed today.       The St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, was the site of a week-long luxury retreat for executives of the AIG insurance company, who headed there less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out the company. &amp;amp;quot;Rooms at this resort can cost over $1,000 a night,&amp;amp;quot; Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) said this morning as his committee continued its investigation of Wall Street and its CEOs.       AIG documents obtained by Waxman&amp;#039;s investigators show the company paid more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges.       &amp;amp;quot;Their getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that,&amp;amp;quot; said Cong. Elijah Cummings(D-MD).                      http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5973452&amp;amp;amp;page=1       Well, not quite but here&amp;#039;s our hard earned tax dollars at work. We bailed these fuckers out and they go to a fucking spa? I swear we should have let those fuckers fail. Where are all the naysayers now? The government is just as much to blame. They just handed these fucks $85 billion dollars with NO controls? What sense does that make?       Greed is hijacking this country and flushing it down the shitter.       We need to take it back.
