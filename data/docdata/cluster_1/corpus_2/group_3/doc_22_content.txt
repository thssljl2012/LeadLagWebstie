In September when it was announced that AIG was in big trouble, Paulson set the wheels in motion for the $700 billion dollars bailout.(*) AIG received an $85 billion commitment from the government and the taxpayer would pay for their screw up. Apparently the event was so stressful for AIG CEO&amp;amp;#8217;s, felt they needed a week long vacation on the taxpayer dime. I wish I could take a one day vacation!     These greedy SOB&amp;amp;#8217;s took taxpayer money and spent a week at the  St. Regis Resort , which is advertised as  &amp;amp;#8220;One of the World&amp;amp;#8217;s Top 10 Luxury Resorts&amp;amp;#8221;                 &amp;amp;#8220; Rooms  at this resort can cost over $1,000 a night,&amp;amp;#8221; Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) said this morning as his committee continued its investigation of Wall Street and its CEOs.     Harry Waxman Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, held  hearings  on the AIG bailout and exposed the greed and theft of U.S. tax dollars.     AIG documents obtained by Waxman&amp;amp;#8217;s investigators show the company paid more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges. resorts in the nation.  St. Regis Invoice: AlG American General 9/22/2008 - 9/30/2008 ,  Spa bill            &amp;amp;#8220; In each case,  the companies and their executives grew rich by taking on excessive risk,&amp;amp;#8221; said Waxman. &amp;amp;#8220;In each case, the companies collapsed when these risks turned bad. And in each case,  their executives are walking away with millions of dollars while taxpayers are stuck with billions of dollars in costs .&amp;amp;#8221;     Waxman added, &amp;amp;#8220; The AIG CEOs are like the Lehman CEO  in one other key respect - in each case,  they refuse to accept any blame for what happened to their companies .&amp;amp;#8221;     Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., a senior committee member,  described the expensive retreat as &amp;amp;#8220;outrageous.&amp;amp;#8221;  He said it included visits to the spa and golf course, with $10,000 in so-called &amp;amp;#8220;leisure dining&amp;amp;#8221; - which he suspected was actually drinking  -  with lodgings that cost more per night than some of his constituents spend on their monthly mortgage payments.   &amp;amp;#8220; The American people are paying for that, and they&amp;amp;#8217;re very upset ,&amp;amp;#8221; said Cummings.      &amp;amp;#8220; Average Americans  are s uffering economically. They&amp;amp;#8217;re losing their jobs, their homes and their health insurance ,&amp;amp;#8221; House Oversight Committee Chairman Henry Waxman, D-Calif., scolded.  &amp;amp;#8220;Yet less than one week after the taxpayers rescued AIG, company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation .&amp;amp;#8221;      &amp;amp;#8220; You have cost my constituents and the taxpayers of this country $85 billion and run into the ground one of the most respected insurance companies in the history of our country ,&amp;amp;#8221; said Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. &amp;amp;#8220;You were just gambling billions, possibly trillions of dollars.&amp;amp;#8221;     Today, Waxman sent Paulson a  letter  which stated the following:       Today the Oversight Committee held a hearing examining the $85 billion government bailout of AIG. The hearing showed that even after the bailout, AIG has spent freely on executive compensation and perquisites. U.S. taxpayers are paying for AIG&amp;amp;#8217;s profligate(*) spending.       Today&amp;amp;#8217;s hearing revealed that shortly after the bailout was signed, executives from AIG&amp;amp;#8217;s major U.S. life insurance subsidiary, AIG American General, held a week-long conference at an exclusive resort in California. The company spent nearly half a million dollars in a single week at this resort, including(*) thousands of dollars on catered banquets, golf outings, and visits to the resort&amp;amp;#8217;s spa and salon.       The hearing also revealed that AIG continues to pay one million dollars a month to an official who helped bring about the company&amp;amp;#8217;s downfall. This official, Joseph Cassano, is the former president of AIG&amp;amp;#8217;s Financial Products division, the unit that sold the credit default swaps that caused billions in losses for AIG. Mr. Cassano resigned from his position in March 2008. Yet AIG has inexplicably decided to pay Mr. Cassano up to $34 million in unvested bonuses. Even today, it is continuing to employ him as a &amp;amp;#8220;consultant&amp;amp;#8221; for one million dollars a month.       AIG received $85 billion in taxpayer money, yet it continues to lavish its executives with undeserved payments and perquisites. We urge you to protect the taxpayers&amp;amp;#8217; money and end this profligate spending.     It appears to me that Paulson, who will be unemployed in a few months, is paving the way for his future. Keeping his friends rich and happy at taxpayer expense should secure Paulson a nice Wall Street job.       Congress needs to take AIG&amp;amp;#8217;s $85 billion back!  Every single company that will be getting one dime from the $700 Billion dollar bailout needs to turn over a complete accounting with receipts. I want my tax money accounted for and Paulson put infront of Waxman everytime he writes a check.     &amp;amp;amp;copy;2008  BlueBloggin .
