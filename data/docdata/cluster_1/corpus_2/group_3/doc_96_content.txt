This guy on another board broke it down in terms that I could understand.    &amp;amp;quot;Basically, my post was intended to point out (to Joe Q Public) that as a taxpayers, we own 80% of AIG through the Government. Our collateral for the loan provided to AIG is comprised of all of their assets, including the American General insurance subsidiary which was the subject of the extravagant retreat. AIG the parent is now operating under a conservatorship of the US Government and they must sell assets to repay our loan over the next two years. Nearly all the assets targeted for sale are service companies much like American General. As such, their greatest assets are the people who bring in the business, in this case independent agents. In order to maintain the asset value of these subsidiaries, they need to retain the people. The retreat in question was booked back in 2007, long before the current crisis. The purpose of the retreat was to take care of the best producers for American General. That is maintaining value. Although American General is not considered as one of the assets that AIG will target for sale, it is collateral for the Government loan and I as a taxpayer want that collateral value maintained so the loan can be repaid.    My point in all this is the irony of Joe Q Public venting about the expense of this &amp;amp;quot;extravagant retreat&amp;amp;quot;, when in reality, the event was probably preserving collateral value for the loan our Government has provided AIG. We should want them to preserve the collateral value.&amp;amp;quot;
