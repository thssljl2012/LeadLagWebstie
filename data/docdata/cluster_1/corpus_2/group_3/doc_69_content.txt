   I got a chirpy letter in yesterday&amp;#039;s mail telling me not to worry because the new company is quite solvent. Pardon me for being a bit skeptical about the term &amp;quot;solvency.&amp;quot;       AIG is a large firm comprised of a number of companies offering different lines of insurance. The life insurance unit is doing fine, and this so-called junket in the news recently was an incentive comp bonus for the sales men in that particular line of business.
