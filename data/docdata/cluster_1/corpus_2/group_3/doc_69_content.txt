Unfortunately it will never happen since money talks.     1) The &amp;amp;quot;partiers&amp;amp;quot; were not the folks who caused AIG&amp;#039;s problems. They&amp;#039;re insurance agents. They sell policies to taxpayers.  2) If the $85b loan is used just to pay claims, there will be nothing left to repay the loan.  3) Put the agents in jail, and there will be no future profits to repay the loan. Let them have their party (which they paid for with pre-bailout work) and they&amp;#039;ll keep selling insurance. The profits from the insurance are the means for AIG to repay the loan.  Be careful you don&amp;#039;t bite the hand that feeds you.
