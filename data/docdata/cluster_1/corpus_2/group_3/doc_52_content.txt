 BQI Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              AIG &amp;quot;Unbridled Greed&amp;quot;...    A week after the insurance giant the   American International Group   received an $85 billion federal   bailout  , executives at its life insurance subsidiary, AIG General, held a weeklong retreat at the exclusive St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif. Expenses for the week, lawmakers were told, included $200,000 for hotel rooms, $150,000 for food and $23,000 in spa charges.     In addition, the former A.I.G. executive who led the London-based division whose implosion is largely blamed for the insurance giant&amp;amp;#8217;s downfall, Joseph Cassano, continues to receive $1 million a month from the company, on top of the $280 million he received in the last eight years.     And even after A.I.G. reported $5 billion in losses in the final quarter of 2007, its former chief executive,   Robert B. Willumstad  , argued before a compensation committee that executives should receive performance bonuses. He received $5 million. Mr. Willumstad left after A.I.G. received federa assistance. The current chief is Edward M. Liddy.    &amp;amp;#8220;This unbridled greed, this callous abuse of trust of hard-working Americans&amp;amp;#8217; savings is just so disgusting it is hard to put into words, and the anger level in America is coming, as it often has, at Wall Street,&amp;quot; Representative Mark Souder, Republican of Indiana, said.
