If the taxpayers want the loan to AIG to be repaid, AIG&amp;#039;s insurance companies will have to keep selling insurance. That means keeping the agents happy (as well as the policyowners). Despite the troubles of the AIG holding company, all the AIG insurance companies are solid. To repay the loan, the life companies (American General, SunAmerica, VALIC, and ALICO) are all likely to be sold. To get a solid offer, each of these insurers must continue to be a going concern. Let&amp;#039;s not kill the goose before it returns our golden egg.     Don&amp;#039;t bet its going to return anything. American General made its money by canceling life insurance policies on 80 year old retirees. The company is rotten to the core and now the chickens have come home to roost.   http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1223427397461...
