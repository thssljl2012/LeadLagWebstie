  Top executives at failed insurance company AIG spent $440,000 at a company retreat just days after the federal government bailed out the company with $85 billion in taxpayer funds, according to documents revealed Tuesday at a Capitol Hill hearing.    http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/oct/08/aig-followed-bailout-with-440000-retreat/   Is it okay for me to gripe about this, seeings how as a taxpayer I now have a vested interest in their success?   very much so................
