 Fed grants AIG even more money, after being given an assload already            QUOTE:                         The deal for the additional Fed loan comes as AIG has been castigated by lawmakers and the White House for spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a posh California retreat just days after getting the federal bailout.       Lawmakers investigating AIG&amp;#039;s meltdown said they were enraged that executives of AIG&amp;#039;s main U.S. life insurance subsidiary spent $440,000 on the retreat, complete with spa treatments, banquets and golf outings. White House press secretary Dana Perino on Wednesday called the event &amp;amp;quot;despicable.&amp;amp;quot;       AIG issued a statement Wednesday saying that the &amp;amp;quot;business event&amp;amp;quot; was planned months before the Sept. 16 bailout and that it was held for top-producing independent life insurance agents, not AIG employees. Of the 100 attendees, only 10 worked for the AIG unit hosting the event, it said.      The insurer said its Chief Executive Edward Liddy sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson &amp;amp;quot;clarifying the circumstances&amp;amp;quot; of the event. In the letter Liddy assured Paulson that AIG is &amp;amp;quot;reevaluating the costs of all aspects of our operations in light of the new circumstances in which we are all operating.&amp;amp;quot;                     I don&amp;#039;t give a fuck if your &amp;amp;quot;event&amp;amp;quot; was planned 5 years ago. Your massive FAIL didn&amp;#039;t happen in the blink of an eye. It took time to roll up into one huge shit ball. And I&amp;#039;m...*we&amp;#039;re* paying for this?
