AIG documents obtained by Waxman&amp;#039;s investigators show the company paid more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges.      &amp;amp;quot;They&amp;#039;re getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that,&amp;amp;quot; said Cong.
