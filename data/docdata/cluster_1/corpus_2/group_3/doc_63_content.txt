( Article I, section 8), the clause that authorizes Congress &amp;quot;To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with Indian Tribes.&amp;quot; It is the legal foundation of much of the U.S. government&amp;#039;s regulatory authority.   Insurance is not considered Interstate Commerce -- Hence we have 50 State (and a few extra possession) Insurance Commissioners each operating a Regulatory Body under separate and quite often very different Laws   You can purchase an individual (non group) plan anywhere. Seniors who purchase Medicare supplement plans purchase them from companies, not states.   Yes you absolutely can -- However the Insurance Company that you purchase from needs to be lisenced in the State you are residing in for you to legally purchase the policy -- The terms are  Domestic Company -- An insurer that is domiciled within your State  Foreign Company --- An insurer that is doniciled in a State other than the Insureds State of residence  Alien Company  ---- An insurer that is domiciled in a foreign Country  To sell insurance in a particular State the Insurance Company has to meet the financial conditions (usually by posting Bonds and other financial interests with the State Commission) of the particular State  These rules are sometimes avoided by Individuals who live close to State borders and who LIE about their residence to save a few dollars.   There are to my knowledge no Federally Charted Insurers. The few Insurance Company failures we see are a direct result of these rules -- The few exceptions -- AIG comes directly to mind -- verge on failure because the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT relaxed the regulatory division between Banking and Insurance --   AIG (and others who verge on failure) -- do so as a direct result of investment decisions that are within their Banking and investment divisions. Until Deregulation these companies would NOT have been allowed to use policyholder reserves to make such risky investments.  Insurance does not meet the Constitutional definition of Interstate Commerce.  Carl
