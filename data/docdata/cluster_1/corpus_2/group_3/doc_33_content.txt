 JCN - it doesn&amp;#039;t affect your ability to drive, it affects the ability of the insurance company to charge you more $   They like charging more $ and have very powerful lobbies representing their interests.   I worked in the investment mgt division of an insurance company many years ago (before it got bought by AIG) and insurance companies make a fortune. Somehow a bond payment got directed to me and it was for something that had been paid off for 3 years!!!!! I asked how that could happen and was told, well, if we get a check we deposit it. Lovely  .  Notice it is the investment part of AIG that is suffering, the insurance divisions are doing ok last I heard.
