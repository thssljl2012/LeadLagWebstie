I do not work for AIG (but do work for another insurance company so know something about the topic). Even if what your friend said is true about the purpose, there are two issues with it. One, I find it hard (read that,impossible) to believe that for a shindig of that size there were no executives in attendance. Second, AIG was one of the key players involved in legal issues around insurance agent compensation in the recent past. Described as you did, this would likely fall way out of the boundaries of reasonable and customary commission and would put them again in hot water with the regulatory agencies and states attorneys general. I obviously can&amp;#039;t prove the points as I do not have all the detail, but it smells rotten to me no matter how you cook it.
