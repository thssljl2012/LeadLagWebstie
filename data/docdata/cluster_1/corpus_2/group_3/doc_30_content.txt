WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Washington policy-makers had no choice but to rescue American International Group Inc after a dramatic investor crisis left the giant insurer starved for cash, New York insurance chief Eric Dinallo told lawmakers on Tuesday.    &amp;#039;Was the bailout necessary? I believe it was,&amp;#039; Dinallo told the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, according to a copy of his prepared remarks obtained by Reuters.    &amp;#039;Most of AIG&amp;#039;s operations, in particular its insurance operations, are solid, profitable companies. Many are leaders in their markets. They have substantial value. But that value could not be realized,&amp;#039; quickly, he said.
