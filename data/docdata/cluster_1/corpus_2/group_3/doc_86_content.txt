Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) said today at the the opening of a House committee hearing about the near-failure of the insurance giant. Site:  voices.washingtonpost.com/livecoverage/2008/1...      This is really despicable behavior and to flagrantly flaunt it in the face of Congress and the tax payers is simply abominable. Equally as bad was AIG&amp;#039;s former CEO, Martin Sullivan and his smug pompous behavior during testimony. When asked if he&amp;#039;d give part of his parting severance package (golden parachute worth $15M) back, he didn&amp;#039;t even hesitate to quickly respond something along these lines, &amp;amp;quot;NO! I&amp;#039;M NOT CONSIDERING IT.&amp;amp;quot;
