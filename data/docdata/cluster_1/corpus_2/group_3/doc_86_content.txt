   This may be a small point, but keep in mind that the people they&amp;#039;re taking on these trips are generally not the people who got AIG into this mess.  The first trip was for their top insurance agents.  These are the guys who are actually selling AIG products and generating revenue for the firm.  These trips are an incentive for agents to hit certain quotas and so on.  If they get cancelled and these independent reps go work for another insurance company, AIG loses much more than $440k.  They had nothing to do with AIG&amp;#039;s problems.  It&amp;#039;s the revenues that these guys were generating that was then improperly invested by AIG.      Second trip was for customers of AIG.  Again, these are the people who buy AIG products and generate revenue for the company.      The insurance business is very sales driven.  Trips like these are the cost of doing business.  As it is, AIG reps are leaving in droves and their customers are defecting.  So cancelling them may actually be a negative for the firm and lead to far more in lost sales than the trips cost.        If the trips were rewarding the actual management and executives of AIG who made the bad decisions that got them into this mess, that would be an entirely different matter and people should be prosecuted.  But what they&amp;#039;re doing in these instances is more akin to taking a client to dinner and picking up the tab (albeit a much larger one).  I am in agreement that the golden parachutes should go away though.  There definitely should be more of a performance incentive tied into the retirement packages (ie, you screw up the company, you don&amp;#039;t get tens of millions).

Meanwhile there are people struggling to find jobs and pay their mortgage...       Disgusting
