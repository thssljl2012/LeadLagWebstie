Buffet&amp;#039;s  AIG goes down the toilet)      Date: 2008-09-13, 3:29PM CDT         Berkshire-Hathaway&amp;#039;s AIG may reveal reorganization earlier      Buffet&amp;#039;s failed insurance company is flushed down the drain to save  the corrupt corporation      BLOOMBERG NEWS   September 13, 2008      Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway&amp;#039;s American International Group Inc.,  the largest U.S. insurer, may accelerate plans to raise capital or  sell assets after its share price plunged 46 percent this week,  said a person familiar with the company. Chief Executive Officer  Robert Willumstad may announce the reorganization before his Sept.  25 deadline, said the person, who declined to be named because the  New York-based insurer hasn&amp;#039;t made an official statement.      AIG shares slumped and the cost of insuring its debt rose to a  record Friday on concern that the company may be the next big U.S.  financial firm after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. to run short of  capital. Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s said Friday it may downgrade AIG&amp;#039;s  credit ratings because the share declines may crimp the insurer&amp;#039;s  access to capital. AIG shares dropped $5.41, or 31 percent, to  $12.14 Friday. The price of credit-default swaps, used as hedges  against losses on bad debt, approached distressed levels and traded  higher than those for Lehman, the securities firm that&amp;#039;s fighting  for survival.      AIG spokesman Joe Norton declined to comment on the reorganization  plans. AIG may be able to raise $20 billion selling assets  including its consumer finance, reinsurance and plane-leasing  units, according to analysts at Citigroup Inc. The insurer raised  $20.3 billion in May by selling debt and equity, diluting the  holdings of long-time investors. &amp;quot;As distressed as they are,  raising new capital could be extremely hard,&amp;quot; said Tim Backshall,  chief strategist at Credit Derivatives Research LLC in Walnut  Creek, Calif.    http://omaha.craigslist.org/vnn/839523380.html
