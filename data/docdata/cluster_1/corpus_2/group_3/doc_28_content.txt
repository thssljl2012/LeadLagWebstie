THe media is using wording and reporting methods to prey on people&amp;#039;s emotions...       http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27201970/            Quote:                         Company officials said the hunting trip in the English countryside was an annual event for customers that had been planned months before the bailout. The company pledged  as it did following the September trip  to do everything possible to end such extravagances. They declined to say which AIG executives attended.      This was an annual event for customers of the AIG property casualty insurance companies in the U.K. and Europe, and planned months before the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks loan to AIG, company spokesman Peter Tulupman said Wednesday morning.      In a prepared statement later in the day, the company said, We will continue to take all measures necessary to ensure that these activities cease immediately. AIGs priority is to continue focusing on actions necessary to repay the Federal Reserve loan and emerge as a vital, ongoing business.
