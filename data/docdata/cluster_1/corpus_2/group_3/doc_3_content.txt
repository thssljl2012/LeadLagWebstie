          Rescued by Taxpayers, $440,000 for Retreat Including &amp;amp;quot;Pedicures, Manicures&amp;amp;quot;  Less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, Congressional investigators revealed today. Not all of the $85 billion that went to AIG was used to save the company.  &amp;amp;quot;Rooms at this resort can cost over $1,000 a night,&amp;amp;quot; Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) said this morning as his committee continued its investigation of Wall Street and its CEOs.  AIG documents obtained by Waxman&amp;amp;#039;s investigators show the company paid more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges.  &amp;amp;quot;They&amp;amp;#039;re getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that,&amp;amp;quot; said Cong. Elijah Cummings (D-MD).  &amp;amp;quot;This unbridled greed,&amp;amp;quot; said Cong. Mark Souder (R-IN), &amp;amp;quot;it&amp;amp;#039;s an insensitivity to how people are spending our dollars.&amp;amp;quot;  Appearing before the committee, Martin Sullivan, the AIG CEO until June, said the company was overwhelmed by a &amp;amp;quot;financial global tsunami,&amp;amp;quot; and that &amp;amp;quot;no simple or single cause&amp;amp;quot; was to blame.
