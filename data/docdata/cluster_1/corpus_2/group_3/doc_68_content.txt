OK being an insurance agent let me fill you in on this part. Anyone who sells life insurance usually has an incentive trip at the end of the year. After all selling life insurance just sucks to make a living to be honest with you. Every single company gives these bonus trips. These trips did not go to the fat cats, but the agents who actually have to sell this crud. AIG is a huge conglomerate and owns many different companys, the insurance companys are actually the money making part of AIG. Am I saying it was right or wrong? Not really, but if it was in my contract and I didnt get it I would sue them to be honest with you.  Oh and the insurance side of AIG is being sold now. They are looking for other companies to buy it so they can pay off their debt to the government. What sunk them is AIG (the didnt call it insurance or it would have had to been regulated) decided they would guarantee all these sub standard loans, well guess what, houses got forclosed and since it was not leaglly an insurance product the company was not required to have the cash on hand to cover a massive loss. Just thought you might like a little background on the whole thing. I havent sold an AIG auto insurance product in over a year because their prices are so high.
