US taxpayers may have to dig deeper for AIG   Tom Bawden in New York         American International Group (AIG), the struggling insurer, has  already used up three quarters of a $123 billion (&amp;amp;pound;78  billion) rescue loan from the US Government and has given warning  that the bailout may not be enough to save it.      The Government swooped in to rescue AIG from meltdown last month by  extending to it an $85 billion loan, in exchange for a 79.9 per  cent stake in the group. On October 8, the Government authorised a  second cash infusion, this time of $37.8 billion, as it emerged  that AIG had spent most of the first loan.      AIG had borrowed $90.3 billion from the Fed&amp;#039;s credit line as of  Thursday night, with much of it being used to honour payouts on  insurance contracts relating to defaulted debts.      Edward Liddy, AIG&amp;#039;s chief executive, said that whether the  government bailout succeeded in its aim was &amp;amp;#8220;very much a  function of two things: one, our ability to stop the bleeding that  we have in the financial products areas ... [and] what happens to  the capital markets&amp;amp;#8221;.

Imaginary money? Or taxpayer money? ), and I think we should be  OK.&amp;amp;#8221;      Details of how much of its loans AIG has spent emerged two days  after it agreed to freeze any compensation payments that had been  due to Martin Sullivan, its British-born former chief executive,  whose contract calls for $19million plus other benefits.      AIG has also agreed with Andrew Cuomo, the New York  attorney-general, to freeze the $600 million deferred payment and  bonus pot of its financial products unit. Mr Cuomo said this week:  &amp;amp;#8220;The American taxpayer is now supporting AIG, making the  preservation of these taxpayer funds a vital obligation.&amp;amp;#8221; The  financial products unit was &amp;amp;#8220;largely responsible for AIG&amp;#039;s  collapse&amp;amp;#8221;, he said.
