We&amp;#039;d better applaud the agents, and hope they keep selling solid insurance plans; otherwise we taxpayers WILL foot the $85b bill.     Or maybe the &amp;#039;agents&amp;#039; better applaud the taxpayers of this country for rescuing a private sector problem, or better yet, the &amp;#039;agents&amp;#039; can tip their collective champangne glasses while on the taxpayer paid for retreat and laugh at us. Would truly be an outrage?
