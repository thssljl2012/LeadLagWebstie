 Grabbing stockholder&amp;#039;s (and now taxpayer) money back from massive distribution to cronies in various swindles.  For example, AIG clawed-back the $ million a month that Joseph Cassano was getting paid for his no-show consulting gig. They did that only when Waxman held hearing and Coumo made a round of legal threats. Cassano in my view one of the lead architects of the general meltdown and certainly led AIG&amp;#039;s efforts to become an insurance version of Enron.   http://www.propublica.org/article/ny-ag-threatens-aig-o...
