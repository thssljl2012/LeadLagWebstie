You are right.       You &amp;amp;quot;don&amp;#039;t know much about the subject&amp;amp;quot;       So let me enlighten you.      Derivatives are related to the   present &amp;amp;quot;crisis&amp;amp;quot; on Wall Street   which is related to 9/11.      That is why I brought up the   subject in the first place.              Quote:                         Lehman brothers bought $100 billion in housing    loans from a bank, the market crashed, and the    loans are valued at 50%.       Lehman Is At $.21  Cents A Share      The stock has gone from $85.00 dollars to $.21    cents. It&amp;#039;s a safe bet that &amp;#039;insiders&amp;#039; had big short    positions in that stock.      What Happened      Lehman bought US sub-prime mortgages from banks,    re-packaged them, and sold them on to global investors.    They became an investment bank lending money to real    estate. They would lend Abe Marovitz $200   million, who then bought Jack Gold&amp;#039;s shopping    center, and the shopping center would go bankrupt.    Jack Gold got $200 million and Lehman&amp;#039;s investors    got a bad IOU.      the truth is Lehman would lend on bogus non-existent numbers.     The US unemployment rate is 5.7%, which isn&amp;#039;t even a mild    recession. This Lehman collapse is a 1929 scenario.       So What Will Happen      Bush will bail out Lehman, and the $200 million    dollar shopping center will be sold for $25 million    to lucky zio-investor. And the fifty thousand small    stock investors will get 5 cents on the dollar.       Here are Lehman&amp;#039;s liabilities        Stock loss   46,000,000,000       Accounts Payable   80,346,000.000        Short/Current Long Term Debt     359,415,000,000        Other Current Liabilities   29,363,000,000           When all the shouting is over you will see    a half a trillion loss. 8          It Is Just A Massive Swindle   The real estate is still there,    the money that bought it is still    there in Abe Gold&amp;#039;s pocket, but    the thousands of investors will    see their retirement go up in    smoke. And Abe&amp;#039;s next move is    to buy gold because eventually    the American dollar becomes    worthless.       http://judicial-inc.biz/89ltehmannew_page_1.htm                       Lehman brothers is a Jewish firm.      But I can not mention that according   to the candy man.

OK. Let&amp;#039;s be polite and call them &amp;amp;quot;Zionists&amp;amp;quot;.   That would make Pat Robertson guilty   and make everyone on this forum feel better.      Zionist Fed Chairman Bernanke    wants to save the crooks at the expense    of the taxpayers and the US economy.   And this after promising Milton   Friedman that they &amp;amp;quot;won&amp;#039;t do it again.&amp;#039;&amp;amp;quot;              Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  Economist Michael Hudson                         Dont let them speak on behalf of voters    and then act against the economy,    claiming that they are trying to save it.    A giveaway of unprecedented magnitude would    cripple it for as far as the eye can see.       - 9-11 and the Crisis on Wall Street                                Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  Chistopher Bollyn                      Ben Shalom Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve,    is the dedicated Zionist Jew behind the $85 billion  taxpayer-funded    bailout of Maurice Greenberg&amp;#039;s criminal enterprise, A.I.G.               The $700 billion bailout is described by the New York Times as    &amp;amp;quot;an ambitious effort to transfer the bad debts of Wall Street    into the obligations of American taxpayers.&amp;amp;quot; This is a massive    &amp;amp;quot;transfer&amp;amp;quot; of American wealth to Zionist criminals.       A $700 billion expenditure on distressed mortgage-related    assets would be roughly what the country has spent in    direct costs on the Iraq war and more than the Pentagons    total yearly budget appropriation.        The bailout would cost every man, woman and child in the    United States more than $2,000 -- before interest.          Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, held a series of conference    calls with members of Congress to sell them on the bailout.        It is certainly no secret that A.I.G. is a criminal operation,  which is    well known to anyone who reads the newspapers.        Following are excerpts from the complaint filed yesterday against     American International Group (A.I.G.); its former chief executive,     Maurice R. Greenberg (M.R.G.); and its former chief financial     officer, Howard I. Smith, by the New York attorney general and    the  New York superintendent of insurance:       &amp;amp;quot;Both Greenberg and Smith had a direct personal interest in    A.I.G.&amp;#039;s stock price; both held hundreds of thousands of shares    of A.I.G. stock.  For example, the value of Greenbergs&amp;#039;s holdings    increased or decreased approximately $65 billion for every    dollar A.I.G. stock moved.&amp;amp;quot;        &amp;amp;quot;For over a decade, A.I.G. engaged in a scheme to     mischaracterize premiums paid on the workers&amp;#039; compensation    line of insurance...      &amp;amp;quot;In 1991, A.I.G.&amp;#039;s general counsel, newly arrived from a law firm,     undertook a review of the practice...      According to the notes, &amp;#039;M.R.G.&amp;#039; asked, &amp;#039;Are we legal?&amp;#039;     When an  employee responded, &amp;#039;If we were legal, we    wouldn&amp;#039;t be in  business,&amp;#039; then &amp;#039;M.R.G. began laughing    and that was the end of  it.&amp;#039;                 Maurice Greenberg&amp;#039;s son, Jeffrey, headed Marsh &amp;amp;amp; McLennan    Companies, the nation&amp;#039;s largest insurance broker, which took    kickbacks and colluded with AIG to rig bids, artificially jacking    up the premiums companies pay for liability insurance,    according to a civil fraud complaint filed by New York Attorney    General Eliot L. Spitzer in 2004.         The civil fraud complaint named AIG, Hartford Financial  Services    Group Inc., ACE Ltd.  (another Greenberg son&amp;#039;s company),     and a division of Munich Re as active participants in the    scheme.         Jeffrey Greenberg, resigned in October 2004, less than    two weeks after Marsh &amp;amp;amp; McLennan was accused of    cheating customers.         A.I.G. GUILTY OF CRIMINAL FRAUD        Two senior AIG executives pleaded guilty to criminal fraud,    acknowledging that they schemed with Marsh and submitted    uncompetitive bids to help the broker steer clients to other    companies.       While it was under investigation in 2005, A.I.G. disclosed    &amp;amp;quot;extensive accounting irregularities.&amp;amp;quot;  The company&amp;#039;s    earnings for the past 5 years were adjusted by some    $4 billion.  In 2004, Greenberg was paid at least $20    million from Starr International, his private company in    Panama, and A.I.G....       If you look at Bernanke&amp;#039;s biography you will find that he    has spent his entire life engaged only in Zionist activities.     I have not found any period of Bernanke&amp;#039;s life when he    was involved in anything other than Zionism.                One of Greenberg&amp;#039;s aircraft, for example, a Gulfstream 4 with    tail number N971L, was involved in the abduction of crew    members who survived the Estonia catastrophe in    September 1994. Greenberg&amp;#039;s plane left Stockholm&amp;#039;s    Arlanda airport with half a dozen &amp;amp;quot;unregistered passengers&amp;amp;quot;    and took them to Bangor, Maine,  the day after 11    surviving crew members disappeared from Stockholm&amp;#039;s    Huddinge hospital.)        The first plane of 9-11 flew directly into the secure computer    room of Marsh (Kroll) USA, part of Greenberg&amp;#039;s company.        Mark Wood, an eyewitness, said: &amp;amp;quot;It looked like a mid-sized    executive jet and the way it turned suggested it was being    aimed deliberately at a target.&amp;amp;quot;      There is much more information about Maurice Greenberg&amp;#039;s    ties to  9-11 in        &amp;amp;quot;The Architecture of Terror: Mapping the Israeli Network  Behind 9-11.&amp;amp;quot;          The Fleecing of America: $700  Billion for Zionist Criminals                         The Planes and Passengers of 9/11        Maurice Greenberg is Jewish.      But I can not mention that     according to the candy man!      OK. Lets call Greenberg a   Zionist too.                      .
