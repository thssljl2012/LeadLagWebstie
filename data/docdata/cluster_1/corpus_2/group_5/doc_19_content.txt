AIG Sells $16 Billion in CDOs a financing entity has purchased an additional $16 billion in collateralized debt obligations insured by the insurance giant through credit-default swap contracts. So far, $62.1 billion of such CDOs have been purchased, canceling the CDS contracts and relieving some pressure on AIG's liquidity. The move comes as AIG has been trying to pay back as much as $60 billion in loans it received as part of its September government rescue. The entity, Maiden Lane III, was created by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last month to mitigate AIG's liquidity issues in connection with its CDS contracts. The Fed said then that it would lend as much as $30 billion to the facility and AIG would lend $5 billion. The entity will collect cash flows from the CDOs and pay a distribution to AIG for its equity interest once principal and interest owed to the Fed have been paid in full. After payment of the Fed's senior loan and AIG's equity interest, all remaining amounts received by the entity will be paid 67% to the Fed and 33% to AIG. Washington initially rescued AIG in mid-September, when the insurer faced possible bankruptcy, by lending it as much as $85 billion at high interest rates. Since then, the government has twice agreed to change the deal. Initially, it increased the possible loan to nearly $123 billion. Then, in mid-November, it agreed to a new package valued at about $150 billion -- of which as much as $60 billion is a loan -- that slashed AIG's interest rate on the loan. AIG is planning to sell much of its life-insurance businesses around the world, as well as its aircraft-leasing unit, in hopes of raising tens of billions of dollars. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123013258498132919.html?mod=googlenews_wsj
