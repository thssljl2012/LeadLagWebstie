 I&amp;#039;ve worked in the Insurance industry for 10 years.  AIG marketed an insurance product without having reserves for it and without calling it an insurance product.  It was legal due to poor regulation.    AIG has very little to do with the Healthcare debate.  AIG is primarily a Life, Annuity, Property, and has very limited Health Insurance programs.
