Quote:              Just a comment on auto insurance, and I may just be talking from my arse   here, my brother who worked as an adjusters manager told me that the   insurance co.'s made their big money from investing premiums into the   stock markets. Might be the next one's in line for a bail-out?                 All insurance companies make their money on investments and unfortunately    many of them invested in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage backed bonds    and they also issued credit default swaps.      In the insurance business, the customer pays the premium in advance, so the    insurance company can invest it. They usually just break even on the claims,    although for property and casualty insurance it is a little more volatile    (some profitable years and some losses) because of hurricanes and other    natural disasters.      That is how Warren Buffet got rich. He owns Geico and General Re (which    sells insurance to insurance companies to mediate risk). He then takes the    money and invests it.      AIG, the largest insurance company in world was already bailed out by the    Federal Reserve a few months ago to the tune of $85 billion. The reason is    that held a huge number of mortgage backed securities. But the Fed took an    79.9% equity position in the company in exchange for the $85 billion, so    they could end making a profit down the road.
