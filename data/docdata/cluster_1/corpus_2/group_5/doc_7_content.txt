AIG BAILS ON LOANS FROM FEDS By Paul Tharp 11:17 am December 12, 2008 Uncle Sam may not get paid back as promised in its $150 billion bailout of American International Group, the giant insurer conceded. AIG had agreed as a condition of its recent government lifeline to escape bankruptcy that it would repay at least $60 billion by selling valuable assets. However, CEO Ed Liddy admitted yesterday that it may not be that easy to raise the cash. "These are challenging times to undertake divestiture," Liddy acknowledged at a Hong Kong luncheon speech, far from the ears of Washington, DC, lawmakers. "It's quite possible that the pace and order of our divestitures will change." AIG promised to sell life insurance, retirement services and an airplane-leasing unit to repay a $60 billion government loan in its overall $150 billion - and counting - rescue package, in exchange for Uncle Sam taking a 79.9 percent stake in AIG. Among units being shopped are American Life Insurance Co.'s Japanese unit, AIG Star Life Insurance Co. and AIG Edison Life Insurance Co. Meanwhile, AIG is slashing prices to win new insurance business and gain quick cash, stoking industry fears that it's taking on too much new exposure but charging too little in premiums to ever pay future claims. Such practices nearly sank the industry in the 1980s, and this time could leave taxpayers holding the bag for huge claims. "I think it's fair to say they're doing some very stupid things in the market," said Edmund Kelly, CEO of rival Liberty Mutual. http://www.nypost.com/seven/12122008/business/aig_bails_on_loans_from_feds_143759.htm
