What is the worth of a bank or an insurance company? The expertise of the people who work there.  Why should an insurance specialist stick around at AIG to help pay of the debt the owners racked up doing noninsurance business when Warren Buffett or someone will hire them for more money and lavish them with perks?  AIG will become a hollow shell all the best people will be hired away and the public will be saddled with all the debt from the insolvent company.     There are none so blind as he who watches Fox News.
