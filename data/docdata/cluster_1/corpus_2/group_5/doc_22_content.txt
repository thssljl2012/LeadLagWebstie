Here is another financial that boosted its forecast and sells MBS. Come on FRE, move that 1000-pound gorilla~! UPDATE 5-Hartford more than doubles in price on outlook 11 minutes ago - Xinhua Financial News Related Companies Symbol Last %Chg HIG 15.54 115.53% As of 3:41 PM ET 12/5/08 Hartford Financial Services Group Inc raised its 2008 profit forecast and said it had more than enough capital to withstand significant further deterioration in equity markets, leading its shares to more than double in price. The outlook provided reassurance to investors, who had driven Hartford&amp;#039;s shares down 92 percent this year on worries that the life, property and casualty insurer could run short of the capital needed to back policies. &amp;quot;A shroud of uncertainty was lifted after Hartford commented on its capital provisions. Investors immediately went looking for a lasting reversal in the share price,&amp;quot; said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut. Hartford had the biggest percentage gain of any stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange. But in spite of Friday&amp;#039;s gains, the shares are still nearly 85 percent below where they traded about a year ago. &amp;quot;We are well capitalized to withstand further downdrafts in equity markets,&amp;quot; Chief Executive Ramani Ayer said at an investor presentation. &amp;quot;We expect investments will recover even in a severe recession scenario. And we are taking steps to de-risk our annuities business.&amp;quot; Excluding some investments, the Hartford, Connecticut-based company now expects full-year profit of $4.70 per share to $4.90 per share, up from an Oct. 29 forecast of $4.30 to $4.50. Analysts on average had expected $4.38 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. &amp;quot;Their guidance caught investors by surprise. It&amp;#039;s a big number. The whole insurance sector had been beaten up and now people are buying their common stocks again as well as their call options,&amp;quot; said William Lefkowitz, options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York. Hartford said the higher outlook reflected an increase of 62 cents per share from the release of $300 million of reserves for property and casualty claims. It does not include any easing in regulatory capital requirements for life insurers that are currently being considered by nationwide insurance commissioners, said Chief Financial Officer Liz Zlatkus. Such a change would be &amp;quot;upside&amp;quot; for Hartford&amp;#039;s results in 2008 and 2009, she added. Partly offsetting this were lower-than-expected investment results as equity markets tumbled. The outlook assumes the Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s 500 index ends the year at 860, about 2 percent above Thursday&amp;#039;s close. Ayer said Hartford could withstand capital erosion even if the S&amp;amp;P 500 fell below 700. Hartford has been rebuilding capital after poor investment results led to a $2.63 billion third-quarter loss. In October, the company raised $2.5 billion from German insurer Allianz SE. CFO Zlatkus said Hartford&amp;#039;s liquidity is strong, with a revolving credit facility of $1.9 billion and contingent capital of $500 million available and untapped. She said there is currently no need to draw on either. The company is cutting costs and reducing risks in its investment portfolio as it seeks to weather what it called the toughest market since the Great Depression. Chief Investment Officer Greg McGreevy said Hartford is curbing its holdings of financial services equity and debt. Over the long-term, it will invest much less in derivatives, including commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset backed securities, he added. Last month, Hartford agreed to buy a small Florida thrift and said it would apply to become a savings and loan holding company, making it eligible to receive up to $3.4 billion under the U.S. government&amp;#039;s $700 billion financial rescue plan. Hartford characterized its capital level as strong, warranting at least a &amp;quot;double-A&amp;quot; credit rating, and said it held more than $12 billion of cash, short-term investments and U.S. Treasuries on Nov. 30. The company&amp;#039;s shares were up $8.00, or about 111 percent, at $15.21 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange after earlier rising as high as $15.94. Option traders scooped up bullish calls in Hartford. Late on Friday, about 97,000 calls and 31,000 puts had traded in Hartford, seven times the normal combined daily volume, according to option analytics firm Trade Alert. The S&amp;amp;P Insurance index rose about 12 percent, led by Hartford and larger life insurer rivals Prudential Financial Inc and MetLife Inc, and getting a boost from the possibility that regulatory capital requirements could soon be eased.
