On Monday, C.V. Starr &amp;amp; Co. turned over 4.42 million shares valued at $8.4 million to fulfill a variable prepaid forward contract with Credit Suisse Group that generated $240 million for Mr. Greenberg when he entered it. The delivered shares represent the contractual maximum based on a formula tied to the stock price. Executives have used variable prepaid forward contracts with investment banks to limit the risk of holding big blocks of their company&amp;#039;s stock. Most of these arrangements let the investor defer capital-gains taxes while retaining voting rights, said Carr Bettis, founder of research firm Gradient Analytics. When Starr entered the deal, AIG shares were trading at about $67, meaning the stock turned over Monday was worth $296.3 million in 2005. Mr. Bettis said banks receive the shares at a discount as incentive for taking the risk and typically balance that risk with their own hedging strategies. AIG&amp;#039;s shares closed at $1.91 on Monday. Shares are off 97% this year. Starr has a similar deal with Citigroup Inc. for $160 million that comes due later this month. The maximum number of shares required to be turned over under that contract is 2.92 million. The federal government offered AIG a rescue package in September as the insurance giant was teetering on the brink of collapse amid the credit crisis. Credit Suisse and a lawyer for Starr declined to comment.
