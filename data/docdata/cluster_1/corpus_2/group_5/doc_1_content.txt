 On the independent side the pay is not that good compare to other companies UL. However, it is one of the best product  out there. I&amp;#039;ve been selling the &amp;amp;quot;Quality of LIfe&amp;amp;quot; product ever since it came out. The UL product is very competitive. The current interest rate is 6% and guaranteed 5% for the next 10 years. ON top of that the ABR riders. There&amp;#039;s is not a company out there with better UL than AGLA
