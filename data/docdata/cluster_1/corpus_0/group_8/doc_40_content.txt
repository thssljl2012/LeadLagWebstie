     &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;The terms of the Fed's purchases of Collateralized Debt Obligations undertaken by AIG, and of Credit Default Swaps&#0160;issued and guaranteed by AIG, have now been&#0160;revealed.&#0160; The Fed apparently paid 100% of the declared value of these 'instruments'.&#0160; The parties that declared the value of these instruments were the parties that held them, called "counterparties" on Wall Street and called Policyholders under these unregulated, unreserved Credit Insurance Policies,&#0160; See Henny Sender, "AIG Saga Shows Dangers of Credit Default Swaps" (Financial Times.com, Friday, March 6, 2009). &#0160;&#0160;&#0160;&#0160;Since the "counterparties" were fully paid off, "the process was reasonably harmonious."&#0160; (Why would it not be, at least from the point of view of the parties receiving 100% of the money they claimed?)&#0160; It is also reported that the Fed, AIG and the holders were able to avoid "valuation disputes."&#0160; Id.&#0160; (I will bet I guess they were harmonious, since they apparently avoided&#0160;anything resembling a&#0160;negotiation.)
