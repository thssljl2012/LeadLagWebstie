At this point, I&#8217;d probably just give up. From BNA ($) AIG Sues Government for $306 Million Refund of 1997 Taxes, Interest, Penalties The insurance company American International Group Inc. (AIG) Feb. 27 filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York claiming that the federal government erroneously and illegally collected more than $306 million in taxes, penalties, interest, and additions to tax from AIG for tax year 1997 (American International Group Inc. v. United States , S.D.N.Y., No. 1:09-cv-01871-LLS, complaint filed2/27/09). The complaint outlined seven transactions in which foreign tax credits were generated. It said that AIG was entitled to the full amount of the foreign tax credits totaling $61.9 million described in the seven transactions and because the IRS erroneously denied the disallowed foreign tax credits, AIG was entitled to a refund for 1997. Really, what&#8217;s the point? It&#8217;s going to cost AIG and the government (its 79.9% owner plus $150 billion or so in debt) millions of dollars to fight the tax credit issue amongst itself. Just settle at this point so they both can move on.
