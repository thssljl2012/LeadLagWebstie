AIG 4th quarter losses was $61 billion&#8230;..thinking&#8230;.but they have had three infusions of cash from the taxpayer and they still lost $60 billion? And guess what? They WANT MORE! That is right they want $30 billion more and will get it&#8230;..where will we drfaw the line on these dead companies? AIG provides insurance to 100,000 entities, including small businesses, municipalities, 401(k) plans, and Fortune 500 companies, which employ more than 100 million Americans, notes a joint statement Monday from the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve about the complex financial transactions involving the company. In addition, AIG has 30 million policyholders and provides retirement insurance for hundreds of thousands of teachers and nonprofit organizations. For its part, AIG characterized the latest government effort as a restructuring that will strengthen its capital base and reduce the amount of money it owes taxpayers. The latest commitment by the US will allow AIG over a five-year period to raise $30 billion of capital by issuing noncumulative preferred stock to the US Treasury when the company needs the money. When the US government made its first investment in AIG  some $85 billion  last September, the company planned to repay the taxpayers by selling some of its assets. However, now the company says the sharp decline in global economic conditions has adversely affected its ability to divest those assets. Just how much will these brain dead companies be allowed to draw from the treasury? None of the news helps the markets&#8230;..none of the cash we have thrown at the Wall Street firms have stabilized anything&#8230;&#8230;how long will we continue to feed a DEAD horse?
