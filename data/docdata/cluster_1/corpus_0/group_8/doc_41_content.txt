 WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8212; Insurance giant AIG will have to return to the Treasury Department the $165 million it just paid out in executive bonuses, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Tuesday in a letter to congressional leaders.  &#8220;We will impose on AIG a contractual commitment to pay the treasury from the operations of the company the amount of the retention awards just paid,&#8221; Geithner wrote. &#8220;In addition, we will deduct from the $30 billion in assistance an amount equal to the amount of those payments.&#8221;  That would seem to be a double payment, but CNN was unable to reach the Treasury Department Tuesday night for clarification.  Further, AIG, essentially bankrupt, has been kept afloat by $170 billion in bailout funds from the government &#8212; any money it returned to the treasury would be money it had received from the government.
