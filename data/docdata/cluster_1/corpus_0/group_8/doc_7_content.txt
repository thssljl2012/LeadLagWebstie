AIG's board of directors voted Sunday afternoon to restructure its existing debt to the federal government. AIG has already received about 123-billion in federal help to stay afloat. Under the restructuring plan approved by its board, AIG would pay a lower interest rate on a 60-billion-dollar government credit line. Existing loan terms would also be relaxed. In return, the Federal Reserve would hold part ownership in AIG's American Life Insurance division and the American International Assurance Company. American taxpayers already own 80 percent of AIG. A week after receiving the first batch of taxpayers' money, AIG executives took off on a lavish California retreat that cost nearly half-a-million dollars and included spa treatments, banquets and golf outings. In November 2008, just a few days before negotiating another bailout with the government for an additional 40-billion dollars, AIG reportedly spent another 343-thousand dollars on a similar trip to a resort in Phoenix, Arizona.
