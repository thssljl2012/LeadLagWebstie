The move, aimed at helping the stricken insurer absorb the blow of huge losses, is the third time in five months AIG has been bailed out by the authorities. Coming shortly after the third government rescue of Citigroup, the decision to save AIG could fuel mounting public anger.   The latest plan, approved by AIGs board on Sunday, spells the end of any lingering hopes the company could survive as a standalone insurance group.  At the end of the restructuring, AIG will remain as a holding company but its main task would be to sell off or list businesses such as its US personal lines insurer, an aircraft leasing company and its global general insurance unit, and could eventually be wound down.  FULL STORY  This is HUGE news.  First Citigroup and now AIG.  Who's next?  EDIT:  Their stock is at 0.42.  Yes, forty-two cents.
