Despite what I wrote in Beware False Indicators of Bank Health, there is a certain amount of comfort in having a physical bank location to go to.

A few years ago, a physical brick and mortar bank meant that you weren&amp;#8217;t ever going to get close to a high yield saving account&amp;#8217;s interest rates. However, several national brand name banks have begun offering high yield online savings accounts in order to compete for your deposits. I used the list of the 20 largest banks, according to FDIC information current as of May 2008, and only found five banks that offered high yield savings accounts. I was surprised not to see Washington Mutual (3.75% APY) on the list of the largest 20 banks. #1 Citigroup - 2.25% APY This New York, N.Y. based bank had approximately $2,199,848M in deposit assets as of May of this year and Citigroup has a high yield online savings account, known as their Ultimate Savings Account, offering a pedestrian 2.25% APY (They have an MMA offering 2.65% APY with bill pay). They used to have a standalone e-Savings account offer but it appears that you are now required to have a linked checking account and the interest rate is a laughable 1.50% APY. (To find this, go to Citi, click on Banking near the top, then click on Savings in the left sidebar, and look for Ultimate Savings Account) #7 HSBC North America Inc. - 3.50% APY HSBC, located in Prospect Heights, Ill. with $493,010M in assets, is also the namesake of HSBC Direct - a high yield online savings bank offering a 3.50% APY interest rate on its savings account. I wrote a review on HSBC Direct recently and was surprised to find that I was able to link the account to other high yield savings accounts (ING Direct in that case). #11 Citizens Financial Group, Inc. - 3.30% APY  Citizens Financial Group is the holding company for Citizens Bank and they just entered the high yield online savings game with Citizens Bank Direct, offering a 3.30% APY interest rate. I don&amp;#8217;t know much else as their online offering is brand spanking new (CNB has been around since 1920) but I did find a brief review of CNB at Bank Deals. #14 Capital One Financial Corp. - 3.50% APY Not surprisingly, financial services company Capital One has an online savings account offering called the Capital One Online Savings Account (clever huh?) offering 3.50% APY on balances over $10,000 (you earn 2.50% APY if your balance is under $10,000).  #17 BB&amp;#038;T Corp. - 1.75% APY It&amp;#8217;s almost embarrassing to list this but BB&amp;#038;T offers a high interest online savings account that offers 1.75% APY with no minimum balance requirement and no monthly maintenance fees. The Rest These banks were on the list but didn&amp;#8217;t have high yield savings accounts. Many had money market accounts but none were strictly high yield savings accounts: #2 Bank of America Corp., #3 J. P. Morgan Chase &amp;#038; Company, #4 Wachovia Corp., #5 Taunus Corp., #6 Wells Fargo &amp;#038; Company, #8 U.S. Bancorp, #9 Bank of the New York Mellon Corp., #10 Suntrust, Inc., #12 National City Bank, #13 State Street Corp., #15 Regions Financial Corp., #16 PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., #18 TD Bank North, INC., #19 Fifth Third Bankcorp, and #20 Keycorp.
