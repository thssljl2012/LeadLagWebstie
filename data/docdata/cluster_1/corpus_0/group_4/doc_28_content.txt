          How about you? clipped from www.tompaine.comAIG to Pay Millions To Top Workerswashingtonpost.com  American International Group plans to pay out $503 million in deferred compensation to some of its top employees, saying it must tap the funds to keep valuable workers from exiting the troubled insurance giant. News of the payments to top AIG talent comes as the federal government has just put more money into saving the company from bankruptcy, beefing up the total public commitment to $152 billion. Meanwhile, members of Congress are questioning the company's expenditures  including lavish business trips to resorts  during a time when taxpayers are on the hook for the bailout. Some compensation experts and AIG stakeholders yesterday said they considered the exodus of $503 million in AIG money dubious at a time when the company is drenched in red ink.&amp;nbsp;  The Post article also raises this point:The issue of taking deferred compensation ahead of schedule arose during the Enron scandal, when top company executives who had reason to know the company was financially ailing quietly demanded that their staff pay them their deferred earnings ahead of schedule."If this involves putting the same responsible parties first in line [for AIG money], that is clearly not appropriate," said Lee Wolosky, an attorney for Starr International, the largest shareholder of AIG stock. "Half a billion dollars could clearly be better spent paying back the American taxpayer, rather than rewarding the same executives responsible for AIG's current condition." Boy, these guys get my dander up!
