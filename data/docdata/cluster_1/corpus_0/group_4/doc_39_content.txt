Once bitten, but perhaps not twice shy. Reports out of Tokyo say that China Investment Corp. is negotiating to buy 49% of American Life Insurance, or Alico, a subsidiary of troubled U.S. insurer AIG.  CIC&amp;#8217;s stakes in two other U.S. financial firms, Blackstone Group and Morgan Stanley, taken earlier this year, have been hammered by the subsequent collapse in equity prices. And Ping An Insurance lost $2.3 billion in the collapse of the Dutch-Belgian financial giant Fortis in October.   A deal for Alico, which operates in 50 countries, and particularly Japan, would probably fall into the $5 billion-$10 billion range now.
