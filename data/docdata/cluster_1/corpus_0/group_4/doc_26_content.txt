By Peter Morici                                  US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's decision to inject another US$27 billion                   into failed insurer AIG and raise the taxpayers' investment to $150 billion                   suggests he is more intent on helping his pals on Wall Street than protecting                   taxpayer interests.                                                    AIG has solid businesses in industrial, commercial and life insurance, but like                   a lot of financial firms was attracted to easy profits writing credit default                   swaps on mortgage-backed bonds - so called collateralized debt obligations                   (CDOs).
