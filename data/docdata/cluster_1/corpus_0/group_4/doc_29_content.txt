Your tax dollars at work: American International Group plans to pay out $503 million in deferred compensation to some of its top employees, saying it must tap the funds to keep valuable workers from exiting the troubled insurance giant.News of the payments to top AIG talent comes as the federal government has just put more money into saving the company from bankruptcy, beefing up the total public commitment to $152 billion. Meanwhile, members of Congress are questioning the company's expenditures -- including lavish business trips to resorts -- during a time when taxpayers are on the hook for the bailout.Look, if they don't mind screwing over their stockholders, why should they mind screwing over taxpayers? By the way -- because I'm a patriotic American entrepreneur and not some phony-baloney corporate stooge -- Anne Hathaway is hot.UPDATE: Hank Paulson "doesn't know what the hell he's doing." And also, Anne Hathaway is still hot.
