This also is the same reason why many investments are not immediately made available to the public by the SEC.

One of the criteria is the concept of value. Buffet&amp;#8217;s teacher/mentor Benjamin Graham&amp;#8217;s classic book The Intelligent Investor is available online from Amazon.ca/com. I have placed a link to the specific version/edition that I recommend below. There are a few editions out, but this one has the Introduction and Appendix written by Warren Buffet (informative extra commentary). Chapters/Indigo is sold out at the moment but I added a link to the audiobook. However, I find having it in textual format is better for referencing. This book is a must read for followers of Warren Buffet, and the best investment book I ever read. It is a great starting point for stock investing. . Thanks &amp;amp; Happy Investing!
