So AIG is a large insurance company that on Monday basically loaned itself 20 billion dollars to prevent itself from going bankrupt. AIG deals more than just in mortgages. It also deals in corporate loans and hedge funds to name just a few. So if it were to declare bankruptcy it would have a domino effect in the stock market. If AIG were to go under it would probably cause panic like what was seen when the stock market first fell back in the depression. This morning the Federal Reserve gave AIG a loan for 85 billion dollars and the government took control of 79.9% of the company. Even this is not a guarantee that AIG will not go under. I'm not even going to pretend that I understand everything that I've been reading about our countries economical crisis,&amp;nbsp;but it's pretty clear that things are going poorly. I feel like I'm watching a massive car pile up in slow motion. Everything is so fucked up but there is nothing you yourself can do except watch. The New York Times wrote a good article explaining the importance of AIG called Wall Streets Next Big Problem.&amp;nbsp; I suggest checking it out.Alright, It's late.&amp;nbsp; It's almost six a.m. on the east coast.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp;should get to bed.
