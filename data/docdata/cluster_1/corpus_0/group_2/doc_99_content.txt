Monday September 22, 2008 mStar GEORGE TOWN: Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak will attend a special briefing on the nations economy and financial position as well as the global situation when he clocks in at the Finance Ministry today. Second Finance Minister Tan Sri Nor Moha- med Yakcop said yesterday that a wide range of issues would be presented at the briefing including the economic situation, finance and the challenges faced in Malaysia and in the international arena. Speaking at a Ramadan event organised by the Penang Muslim League, he said that among the issues that Najib would be looking into were whether there was a need to repeg the ringgit to the US dollar and the retail price of petrol. Former prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad suggested on Saturday that the ringgit be repegged to reduce the impact of the weakening US dollar against the Malaysian currency. Nor Mohamed said that a decision on petrol price would be made by Najib. In another development, he said talk that insurance company American International Group (AIG) in the country would be closed down was not true. I understand that AIG in Malaysia is a separate company with its own capital. The AIG here is not involved or affected by the position of the AIG abroad, he added. - Bernama
