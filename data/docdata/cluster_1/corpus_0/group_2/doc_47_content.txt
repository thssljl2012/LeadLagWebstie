Facts: The govt is offering to loan AIG up to $85 Billion over the course of 2 years, at 8.5% interest.  The gov now owns 79.9% of AIG and has the right to approve all sales of assets and block the distribution of dividends.AIG has assets of 1.1 trillion.  AIG has a great deal of equity.  What it doesn't have is liquidity in its capital.How did AIG land in this mess?  AIG is a global insurance titan and they insure everything under the sun, including loans.According to this article at Time it's an insurance product that got AIG in trouble:But it's a huge player in the new and mysterious business of credit default swaps, derivative securities that allow banks, hedge funds and other financial players to insure against loans gone bad. AIG generally sells credit default swaps, thus promising to insure others against defaults. It's a great business when defaults are low; when they rise it can turn toxic. AIG FP lost more than $10 billion in 2007, and $14.7 billion in the first six months of this year. That, along with losses in other investment portfolios, have cut deeply into the parent company's capital reserves.In short: Over the past 18 months, AIG's Financial Products division paid out a shitload of money to insure loans gone bad -- there went all the liquidity.Now, should AIG have taken on so many loan insurance obligations?  No.  But if you read the article, there is reason to believe that if AIG had rapidly imploded, because it insured so many loans for global banks, it could've lead to a global banking meltdown.Also, provided the whole thing is handled calmly and rationally and there isn't a paniced fire sale of assets to raise capital, AIG's other insurance endeavors are actually profitable enough that it could repay the loan in a few years.
