 The Kentucky Department of Insurance sent the following to agents licensed in the state on September 19, 2008:  "Notice To  All Agents:  We wanted  to share some information with you regarding the recent turmoil in the market,  particularly concerning American International Group  (AIG). The  Kentucky Department of Insurance has participated in numerous national  conference calls with other regulators, including those in the lead states of  New York and Pennsylvania. We have been assured that the  insurance subsidiaries of AIG are solvent and able to pay claims. As a matter of  fact, the insurance portion of AIG???s business will play a critical role in the  solution to the financial problems of the company. As the AIG  story has unfolded, we have begun receiving reports of agents who are using this  as an opportunity to contact AIG insureds with offers to replace coverage. We  also have received calls from consumers who have been advised to take actions  clearly not in their best interests. We want to  remind you of&amp;nbsp; two statutes??? 304.12-060 -  Defamation (go to http://www.lrc.state.ky.us/KRS/304-12/060.PDF)......"   Click here for the complete letter.
