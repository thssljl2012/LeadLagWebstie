TUN Dr Mahathir Mohamad is reported to have commented recently that the United States government&amp;#8217;s proposed bailout of AIG is hypocritical because when his own administration put in place a bailout plan for selected Malaysian companies  in 1998, the US declared that such bailouts undermined the taxpayers and were  designed to protect companies that should be allowed to go bankrupt. I think the former prime minister is wrong this time.  AIG is a global insurer. If AIG were allowed to go bankrupt, the global effects  would be stunning. Not only would  stock markets around the world take a dive, but people  who have taken out insurance policies with AIG would lose their money. The US government has done the right thing. The US taxpayers will pay for this bailout, but the benefits will be felt  globally. The US government is not being hypocritical. It treats each case on its merit.  After all, only a week earlier, Lehman Brothers, another US giant, was allowed to file for bankruptcy. Its failure sent a strong message to other US investment banks. The rescue of AIG was to save the global capital markets. The situation is very different from what Malaysia faced in 1998. As for the ringgit, the move in 1998 to peg the currency and protect the Malaysian economy was a wise and inspired move by Dr Mahathir. However, I recall Dr Mahathir had blamed currency speculators for the fall of the ringgit. The move to peg the ringgit and  prohibit the trading of the currency was designed to stop  speculative trading.  The situation now is very different. The volatility of currencies has nothing to do with speculators. It reflects the economic fundamentals of a country.  To peg the ringgit would send a message to  capital markets and investors that the country&amp;#8217;s economy is weak.  If it is, so be it  &amp;#8212; the role of the government is to strengthen it and not artificially protect it simply to avoid having to make hard decisions. The decision by the government not to peg the ringgit is the correct one. TONY PEREIRA, Petaling Jaya Source: NST &amp;ndash; September 26, 2008
