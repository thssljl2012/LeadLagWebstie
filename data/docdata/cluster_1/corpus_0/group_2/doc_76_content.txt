  Recent Headlines!!! Collapsed of Lehman brothers, merill lynch&amp;amp; nowthe downtime for AIG ?   Severalfianancial companies in theUSare so badly hit by the US subprime (mortage).  Does US do not have any stricter policy &amp;amp; guideline when issueing the mortage loan to house owner?  AIG is another classic case whereby it is being dragged down by the US subprime crisis casuing them to experience a huge write down and downgrading of their credit rating.  Unlike both lehman and merill, AIG has other diversified assets such as airline leasing &amp;amp; etc...... However liquidation of such assetsrequire great amount of time thus the soonest solution will still be accepting the injected US85 billionsfrom the US government to resolve the on handsolvency problem.  Nevertheless due to a matter of fact that AIG being the parent company of AIA it hasdampen the investor &amp;amp; policy owner'sconfidence &amp;amp; morale level.  AIG being a giant insurance company and the biggest playerin the USA, this bad newshas def. sentmany ppl around the worldinto a panic attack.  Especially in singapore, theLocal news have reported that many policy owners rather suffered a lost bysurrendering their policy immediately. Frankly,their premature panic attack &amp;amp; reactionhas causedthem into making an unwise &amp;amp; non economical decision since every life &amp;amp; endownment policy took about19 to 21 yrs to break even.  Now that AIG had alreadyaccepted theUS government US$85 billions loanand the current fianancial situation is such that now they're being rescued.  Nevertheless i just want to put these quotesdown in my blog for reader better understanding towards AIA stands in singapore.  AIA SINGAPORE MANAGED ITS LIFE FUND &amp;amp; INVESTMENT FUND AS A TRUST FUND FOR SINGAPORE POLICYHOLDER. THIS TRUST FUND IS RESERVED FOR POLICY CLAIMS, DIVDEND PAYMENT &amp;amp; POLICY MATURITY. ITS A SEPERATE FUND MAINTAIN BY AIA AWAY FROM THE BOOKS OF AIG. MAS CONFIRMED THAT AIA SINGAPORE HAS ASSETS &amp;amp; RESERVES WAY ABOVE MAS MINIMUM REGULATOY RESERVEREQUIREMENTS.  THE STRAITS TIMES TODAY: 1) ANY SUB PRIME LOSSES THAT MAYBE BORNE BY AIG AS A GROUP LEVEL HAVE NO IMPACT ON POLICY OWNER. 2) LATEST PARTICIPATING LIFE FUND REPORT INDICATED IT DOES NOT HOLD ANY SUBPRIME SECURITY.   Additionally i hope the below articles and press released will further explain itself.
