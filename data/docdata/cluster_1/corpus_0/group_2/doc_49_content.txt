     Questions from Steve Bainbridge (possible answers from me): (1) On what basis does the Fed have authority to use the discount window to bail ouit an insurance company? (Section 13.3 Federal Reserve Act.)   (2) Who would have standing to challenge the Fed action, if anyone? (NA)   (3) Why was AIG to big too fail but Lehman wasnt? Was AIGs role in the credit default swap market really that important?&amp;nbsp; (Yes.)  (4) Why extend the moral hazard inherent in federal bailouts from banking to the insurance business? (See 3)   (5) Has the federal government ever taken an equity stake--let alone a controlling stake--as part of a bailout before? Was there any equity stake in Chrysler? (?)   (6) Does it make policy sense for the federal government to put itself in the position of owning an insurer? (See 3)  (7) How can the federal government take a security interest in AIGs assets? Presumably AIG had debt securities outstanding that include negative pledge covenants. If so, why doesnt this deal violate the trust indentures? This one really bugs me.&amp;nbsp; (Arguably violates the Contracts Clause. But the Contracts Clause doesn't apply to the federal government.)  (8) Are we going to see regulation of the credit default swap sector or of derivatives more generally?&amp;nbsp; (Yes) Are the regulators going to think before they act (no) or pull a SOX and just throw a bunch of crappy ideas at the problem? (yes)   (9) Regulation of insurance has been a matter for the states rather than the federal government, so what legal basis is there for any of this? (They're not regulating insurance. So it's dicey that the feds now own a state-regulated business. Kinda throws a spanner into federalism in this area.&amp;nbsp; As for the current federalism issues in insurance (pre AIG) see my article with Butler.)
