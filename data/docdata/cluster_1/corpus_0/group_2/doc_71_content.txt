If you&amp;#8217;ve read a newspaper or watched the news AT ALL this week then you know that things have been crazy over on Wall Street. The investment giant, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy only a short time after experiencing a huge loss in the stock market. Many other companies including insurance giant AIG were affected by many large investors pulling out and stock dropping by the second. Things were extremely hectic for a few days while people were in a panic, trying to save their company as well as their jobs. It was totally crazy and the way I see it, It&amp;#8217;s like the new Great Depression. However, AIG was able to save themselves by accepting a loan 85 BILLION DOLLARS from the Federal Reserve which they have to pay back in TWO YEARS. The only reason that this sort of offer was made was because if AIG fell through, it would effect sooo much of our economy that it&amp;#8217;s not even funny. &amp;#8220;American International Group, Inc. (AIG), a world leader in insurance and financial services, is the leading international insurance organization with operations in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions.  AIG companies serve commercial, institutional and individual customers through the most extensive worldwide property-casualty and life insurance networks of any insurer.  In addition, AIG companies are leading providers of retirement services, financial services and asset management around the world.  AIG&amp;#8217;s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as the stock exchanges in Ireland and Tokyo.&amp;#8220; ~AIG Website So yea, I&amp;#8217;m not really sure how to fix it, but our economy is seriously in a bad place right now and it really feels like a new great depression. Let&amp;#8217;s hope it&amp;#8217;s not, otherwise, we&amp;#8217;re going to have A LOT of problems. Yet, as they say, history repeats itself. Not to mention Hurricane Ike, which hit harder than we thought it would, causing a little more chaos down there. Hurricanes, Stock Market Crashes&amp;#8230;ugh, we better get ready for the long haul.
