Tim Duy comments on the incongruity of the federal government effectively purchasing an insurance company in the bailout of AIG:  I seem to remember that the US owned at least one gentlemens club in the wake of the S&amp;#038;L crisis, so whats the big deal with an insurance company?  Presumably, the &amp;#8220;gentleman&amp;#8217;s club&amp;#8221; was a money-making enterprise.
