Anon: And don&amp;#8217;t worry about the airlines just yet. My bet is that AIG is filing for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday morning NYC time. Someone said they need $75 billion to shore up their capital. Can you imagine the implications of Dow 30 company filing bankruptcy protection? AIG was a huge writer of credit default insurance which means that if they go under the insurance on a lot of the investment grade paper relied on becomes suspect or rather problematic. talk about a vicious circle.
