Bloombert reporting that the Fed is considering conservatorship as solution for AIG. I am not sure how they do that. Insurance companies are regulated on state by state basis. Off the cuff it would seem as though that would require legislation. This is a politically charged election year environment and getting 535 lawamkers to agree would be an ordeal.
