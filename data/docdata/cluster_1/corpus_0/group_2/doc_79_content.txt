Paulsons Monster, as its being called, has now proposed the need for $700 billion of taxpayer dollars, raising the US debt limit to $11 trillion, to spin off the bad sectors of the financials into its own entity. Paulson claims his plan will minimize the cost to the taxpayer in the long run, but who can really be sure? As part of the plan, Paulson said that he was currently in talks with other countries for help. He wouldnt disclose which countries.   Back in Ratings land, one ABK message boarder claimed that the Feds raided Moodys on Friday looking for connections between the ratings company and hedge funds. No link was provided, and given that any Joe Schmo can go on a Google Finance board and post whatever he or she pleases, it could very well be completely fabricated. However, a Bloomberg article titled Berkshire's Bond Insurer, Moody's Stake Face Probe, reports that one such link may in fact come to light:  Billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. faces a probe by Connecticut's attorney general for possible conflicts created by owning almost 20 percent of credit ratings company Moody's Corp. while also running a new municipal bond insurer.   Moody's gave its top rating last week to Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp., created in December as existing bond insurers struggled to maintain their AAA ratings. A favorable rating for Berkshire by New York-based Moody's, or a lower rating for competitors including MBIA Inc. and Ambac Financial Group Inc., may give Buffett's company an advantage.  So maybe there is truth in rumor.   In other news, Barclays is the proud new owner of Lehman Brotherss investment banking and trading businesses. The $1.75 billion deal approved yesterday is a definite bargain as compared to the one Barclays would have had to strike last week for Lehmans entire assets before bankruptcy.
