What kind of day has it been?  Well, Lehman Brothers (the fourth largest investment bank in the country) declared bankruptcy this morning, and Merrill Lynch is selling itself to Bank of America.  And now it appears that AIG -- an insurance and financial services conglomerate with assets (as last reported) of $1 trillion -- is in imminent danger.  New York State insurance regulators have allowed AIG to pull $20 billion from its subsidiaries (not usually permitted, because the subsidiaries need that money to, you know, pay claims), but that's not nearly enough.  The Federal Reserve is trying to talk Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase into lending AIG another $70 billion, pronto.Individually, each of these events is pretty serious bad news.  But the real concern is whether the Fed, the Treasury and the other agencies concerned have anything like the capacity to manage all of this at the same time.  In the cheap irony department: the issue of the Atlantic Monthly I happen to be reading (September 2003) has a big AIG ad on the back cover.  It reads "Over $500 billion in assets, 40 million customers and 80 years of experience say we'll be around."  Or not.
