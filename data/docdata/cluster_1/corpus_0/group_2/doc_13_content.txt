It seemed like Ambac solved its short-term problems a few months ago but that was not to be. It seemed unlikely a few months ago but the suggestion by Moody's this week of a rating downgrade will cause serious problems for Ambac. The situation is very similar to what brought down the insurance giant AIG (however, AIG's problem was with its actual insurance issued in CDS form, whereas Ambac's problem is its side investment management busines). Namely, it looks like Ambac will be short if it had to post collateral, as required under its GIC contracts. Ambac will be short by $1 billion to $2.1 billion (based on present market values), depending on the company rating. Now that it has shelved its Connie Lee idea--I was never a big fan of this--it should have around $850 million. I think its easy to get $1 billion but $2.1 billion could be tough and would require approval from the insurance regulator.What is happening is that the market value of the assets are down (not surprsing given the market conditions) but since the company rating is being cut, it is requiring a greater amount of collateral. These assets were set up to be held to maturity and the assets seem to be ok quality (my guess is that if they were held to maturity, they would not result in losses), so it's not really an asset problem per se. Rather the whole investment management business was set up assuming that the company would have high ratings. This shows the perils of building a business without considering a seriously negative scenario (in this case a ratings downgrade.) It would be quite ironic and sad if Ambac's survives the subprime mortage insurance problems but somehow goes down because of its investment business.
