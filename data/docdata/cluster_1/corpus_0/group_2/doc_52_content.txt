The impact on AIG businesses across Asia has been less than salutary, as expected. Panic-stricken policyholders have lined up all day in Singapore to surrender their policies to secure redemption value. China's insurance regulator declared that AIG businesses in the country were sound, echoing statements from the rest of the region. This is however a big concern going forward given the large market share that AIG commands in many Asian markets, and the sheer volume of domestic securities that it holds across the region. Distressed asset sales will create very large jumps in domestic assets such as in government bond yields, Asian shares and the like for the short-term. - Chan Akya
