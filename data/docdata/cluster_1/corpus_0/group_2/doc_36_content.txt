Make no mistake: the future of AIG is in the hands of Eric Dinallo, superintendent of insurance for New York State.   Insurance companies are regulated by many different agencies, but because so many of the companies are incorporated in New York, the state's superintendent of insurance becomes the de-facto primary regulator. Dinallo led the charge with bailouts of Ambac and MBIA. According to the WSJ Law Blog:  With AIG gasping for air, these days are Dinallo's Stanley Cup, so to speak. According to the WSJ, Dinallo (Vassar, NYU Law) "took a significant role" in AIG's survival talks over the weekend.    Dinallo rose to power under former-Gov. Eliot Spitzer's tutelage. But Spitzer's infamous downfall almost made him a star. As many know, "Client #9" was exposed after his liaison with Ashlee Alexandra Dupree in room 871 of the Mayflower hotel in Washington.   Spitzer's traveling companion earlier that day? Eric Dinallo. The two men were in Washington to give testimony on the how downgrading the ratings of insurance agencies would kill the municipal bond market.   It's pretty clear that Dinallo did not see anything troubling regarding the former governor, and he has steadfastly refused to say anything about the day Spitzer went down. But to be that close to a train wreck and walk away unscathed speaks volumes of Dinallo's private fortitude and public character.   AIG's fate is in the hands of a pretty straight shooter.
