Insurance: Overview Did you know that some of the hottest jobs in finance aren't on Wall Street at all? These are jobs in insurance. Insurance is a trillion dollar business that employs more than 2.5 million people in the United States alone. As the population ages and wealth grows, the demand for insurance professionals will increase dramatically. This is great news for you if your thinking of going in to insurance. Jobs in insurance involve helping individuals and business manage risk to protect themselves from catastrophic losses and to anticipate potential risk problems. Work in this area is not only personally rewarding, but can be financially rewarding as well. You will help clients understand their insurance needs, explain their options to them and hopefully help them purchase appropriate insurance policies. You could work in a variety of areas in insurance including as an underwriter, a sales representative, an asset manager, a customer service rep or an actuary. A theme that is constantly emphasized by insurance professionals is that the industry is ultimately about helping people when they need it the most. The stereotype of a slick, sleazy, fast-talking insurance salesman is largely a figment of the past.LIST OF FEW INSURANCE COMPANIES:FARMERS INSURANCE :USAwww.farmers.com/LIFE INSURERSWebsites   Public Sector Life Insurance Corporation of Indiawww.licindia.comPrivate SectorAllianz Bajaj Life Insurance Company Limitedwww.allianzbajaj.co.inBirla Sun-Life Insurance Company Limitedwww.birlasunlife.comHDFC Standard Life Insurance Co.
