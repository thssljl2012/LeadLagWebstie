Why don't we just do it all now and get it done with? Why piece by piece?Let's have the government run insurance companies, auto companies, banks, mortgage companies, home builders, brokerages, gas stations, and for good measure let's throw in pizza parlors.Here is the rumor (BTW it's true, I am scrambling for a link but cannot find one).Bloomberg is reporting Treasury Said to Be Considering AIG Conservatorship.The U.S. Treasury is considering taking over American International Group Inc. under a conservatorship as one option to address the insurer's crisis, according to two people briefed on the discussions.Executives from AIG, bankers and Treasury and Federal Reserve officials are meeting today on the company's situation at the New York Fed. A number of options are under being discussed to fill a shortfall of $75 billion to $100 billion in funding, one of the people said. The talks are continuing, he said.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., which have been leading efforts to find a private-sector solution, informed the Fed that such an effort would be difficult, the person said. Under another option, the Fed would extend a loan to New York-based AIG, according to a person informed of the matter.Notice how shortfalls have increased from $40 billion, to $70 billion, to $100 billion. Is there any reason for it to stop there.Two Scenarios1) AIG has been fraudulently tapping its insurance subsidiaries2) AIG simply screwed up its main corporate officeIf it's #1 there should be prosecutions, if it's #2 then AIG should be allowed to go under. The Fed can deal with the aftermath. Nowhere should taxpayers be footing the bill for stupid corporate mistakes.While typing this post futures suddenly reversed by about 20 points in a matter of minutes. Bloomberg just announced the Treasury is going to take AIG into Conservatorship.Conservatorship or Nationalization?If you guessed Nationalization you guessed correctly.  An $85 billion Bridge loan by the Treasury to AIG was just announced. The treasury will get an 80% stake in AIG.  It is highly unlikely this will be "temporary". As with Fannie and Freddie, common shareholders are going to get wiped out and taxpayers are going to be on the hook. It will not stop at $85 billion. Lord only knows what this will cost.Mike "Mish" Shedlockhttp://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.comClick Here To Scroll Thru My Recent Post List
