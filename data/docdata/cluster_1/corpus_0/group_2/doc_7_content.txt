Things are looking very grim for AIG:  Scarcely a day after the stunning news of the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers and takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America, arguably an even greater threat to global financial stability is being posed by  American International Group (ticker: AIG).  The nation's largest insurer by assets was seeking a financial lifeline after its credit rating was lowered by Fitch Ratings, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's Investors, an event that could force AIG to, in effect, meet a $14 billion margin call on credit-default swaps it has written.  The Federal Reserve was working with JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs to arrange a massive loan package of up to $75 billion to stave off a severe liquidity crisis at AIG, according to published reports. But reflecting the parlous situation, its shares plunged 61% Monday while the cost of insuring AIG debt soared to astronomical levels.  "The move highlights the circular dilemma facing financials with capital concerns," writes Bank of America credit analyst Jeffrey Rosenberg. "The lack of capital-raising prompts a downgrade, further worsening the credit risk of the company, further constraining the capital-raising potential."  [...]  ...While its credit ratings remain well within investment-grade range, the downgrades could result in AIG's counterparties demanding an additional $14.5 billion in collateral -- in effect, a margin call, according to an SEC filing made last month, according to published reports.  What would happen in that event could be catastrophic. A bankruptcy filing by AIG would have more far reaching consequences than Lehman's. Yet the Fed and the Treasury have drawn a line in the sand against further bailouts after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and Bear Stearns last March.  That leaves the fate of AIG in the private sector's hands, at least nominally.  Damian P.
