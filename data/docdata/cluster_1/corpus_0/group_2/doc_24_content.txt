      Nashville , Tennessee - people are bent out of shape over AIG's troubles. They don't understand how it could get into so much quicksand. Well , here's the beef - the financial part is where the problems lay. The insurance part is Okay. Keep in mind , AIG is only worth about 1.4 Trillion dollars , thru owning 150+ insurance companies , world wide.So , why does AIG need the Feds , for a bail out ? Hmmmmmm ,
