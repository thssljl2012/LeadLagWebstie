Yep, that&amp;#8217;s $85 billion. It boggles the mind. From the NYT: In an extraordinary turn, the Federal Reserve was close to a deal Tuesday night to take a nearly 80 percent stake in the troubled giant insurance company, theAmerican International Group in exchange for an $85 billion loan, according to people briefed on the negotiations. The loan was made to stave off a spreading financial crisis, caused by complex debt securities and credit default swaps. It comes after the Fed pumped in $87 billion to pay off the loans made by Lehman Brothers. Other banks are creaking, including Washington Mutual. Hang on tight.
