Recent events have shown that no company can stay at the top forever, not evenwhen you are supposedto bethe biggest and therichest.As the saying goes: thebigger you are, the harder you fall&amp;#8230; I alwayshave a lot of affinity for AIG, after spending 3 and a half years at AIA whereweareconstantly&amp;#8221;sold&amp;#8221;on the financial strength of our parent company andboasting about being&amp;#8221;the onlyAAA ratedinsurance companyin Singapore&amp;#8221; (on the strength of AIG).Just within a few short years, AIA have lost their credit ratings (now Manulife is the AAA one)and AIG is almost on the brink of collapse. How the mighty has fallen&amp;#8230; Another reasonis a purely frivolous one&amp;#8230;they are the official sponsor of myManchester United. Their logo, soprominently displayedon the jersey, could have been gone if the US govt did not to bail them out and what am I to do with my Man U jerseys with the AIG logos? Hmm&amp;#8230;maybe itmight justbecome a collectors&amp;#8217; item in the future. A jersey with a company that no longer exists&amp;#8230; someting I wouldn&amp;#8217;t hope happening to them, of course.
