         AIG (AIG) Board announced that they have suspended the dividend. No kidding. Thats prudent stewardship.  The question becomes were the past dividends declared incorrectly. There are regulatory constraints about declaring dividends if insurance companies are insolvent.  That AIG is suddenly insolvent will not wash. I would like to see the board investigated and see what these guys were thinking all along.
