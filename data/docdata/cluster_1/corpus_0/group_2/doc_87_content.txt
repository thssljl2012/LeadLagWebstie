S&amp;P have cut Washington Mutual's credit rating to Junk, this means that originating debt gets more expensive, as does getting a loan. It may also mean margin calls for outstanding debt. It's basically a death knell for a bank. stock was off 26% in the normal session and it's off another 16% after hours as I write this. Then we have AIG, (again) the Fed told them to seek outside funds, which was basically a "no" to AIG's request this morning for a $40bn loan, since they didn't want to sell themselves to a private equity firm to raise the cash. The local insurance regulator says that can use $20bn they already have, but that's not really a solution...So the NY Fed is at it again They've gone into another huddle, this time looking to fix AIG:The New York Fed is hosting a fresh set of crisis talks to deal with the problems at AIG, the troubled insurer. JPMorgan Chase, representing AIG, and Goldman Sachs, representing potential principal investors, are in the building working to come up with some kind of funding facility for AIG.The Fed has convened the parties and is facilitating their discussions. But it has not asked JPMorgan and Goldman to provide $70bn in funding for the company, and at this stage has not discussed itself lending indirectly to AIG via back-to-back transactions intermediated by the investment banks, one possible way of channeling liquidity to AIG.US authorities earlier on Monday threw a $20bn lifeline to AIG, one of the worlds largest insurers, just hours after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and Bank of Americas $50bn rescue takeover of Merrill Lynch.The deal between AIG and New York State insurance regulators allows the company to access $20bn of capital from its own subsidiaries in a desperate attempt to stave off a liquidity crisis and credit downgrades.That word desperate is cropping up more and more often, soon it'll be just another day, the new "normal" wont that be fun.
