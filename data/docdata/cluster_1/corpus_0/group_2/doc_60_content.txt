 aig Originally uploaded by ch_harishanker  FRB : Press Release (September 16, 2008) The Federal Reserve Board on Tuesday, with the full support of the Treasury Department, authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend up to $85 billion to the American International Group (AIG) under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. The secured loan has terms and conditions designed to protect the interests of the U.S. government and taxpayers. News that the insurance company of the AIG group might fail got into the news also in Japan. Therefore, I hear that the homepage of ALICO Japan was not temporarily displayed easily. It is likely to settle down by this news.
