Under the deal, the United States Federal Reserve will give AIG a two-year, $85 billion (47 billion) emergency loan at an interest rate of about 11.5 per cent. In return, the government will gain a 79.9 per cent stake in the world&amp;#8217;s largest insurer and the right to remove senior management. AIG said it would repay the money in full with the proceeds from the sales of some assets. It will be up to the firm to decide which assets to sell, and the timing. The US government does, however, have veto power. AIG shares sank 46 per cent, to $2.03, in morning trading yesterday. They traded as high as $70.13 in the past year.  (more&amp;#8230;)
