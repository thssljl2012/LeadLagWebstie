AIG's talks with potential investors, including buyout firms, are ``advanced,'' the publication said.             Nicholas Ashooh, a spokesman for New York-based AIG, had no immediate comment. Jackie Wilson, a spokeswoman for Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire, didn't immediately return a message seeking comment.
