Not liking the sounds of this at all. From Norris 1:15 p.m. AIG shares have bounced from their lows on news that New York State wants to help. The governor says the state insurance department is going to let AIG take $20 billion from insurance subsidiaries and lend it to the parent. AIG always was said to be a politically connected company, and this seems to confirm that. The announcement, you will note, did not come from the insurance regulator. Governor David Patterson says this is "not a government bailout," and he will be right . . . if AIG can meet its obligations. If not, the insurance subsidiaries will have that much less cash to meet their obligations, and then a state insurance fund could be hit to pay claims. But don't worry. Governor Patterson says AIG is "extraordinarily solvent." If he explained why a company that is not only solvent, but extraordinarily solvent, can't borrow money elsewhere, I did not see it in the wire accounts. In any case, AIG is back to $6.90, almost double the low of $2.50 hit this morning.  UPDATE: If you would like to know a bit more about the insurance company you may have just bought (to go with your Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Bear, IndyMac series), check this out. Sure hope that turns out to be a positive equity stake in the "ownership society" and not involuntary servitutude for some picky Dubai slavedriver. Am concerned.
