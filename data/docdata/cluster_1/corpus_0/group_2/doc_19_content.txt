  The current Federal loan to AIG has a silver lining. The insurance industry is currently regulated by the states. Since I testify in California State Insurance Commission hearings I can assure you that rational business interests do not always prevail. I believe the Federal loan to AIG has effectively nationalized the insurance industry. It may well be possible for an insurance customer who gets a different rate or a different contract in multiple states to sue for damages in a Federal Court, arguing that the Federal intervention in the insurance business means Federal laws takes precedence over state law.  This would be a good thing. All insurance rates, including health and medical coverage have a good chance of going down if competition is national rather than state by state.
