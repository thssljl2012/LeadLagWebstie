Sources said the loan, which   will allow AIG to avoid bankruptcy, will be secured and include incentives   for quick asset-sales by AIG. The deal severely dilutes existing shares of   the company. Management of the firm will be fired as part of the deal.   The company is scrambling to raise capital to stay afloat after being hit   with credit rating agencies downgrades. The Fed's financial aid for the   troubled insurer marks a reversal of its decision on Monday to refuse a   bridge loan to AIG.   Nouriel   Roubini, Chairman of RGE Monitor said that it should've been properly   regulated. An insurance company takes premium from people who've bought   insurance and instead of investing it in safe instruments like bonds, starts   guaranteeing CDS and other toxic instruments. We are in a situation where   losses are being socialized and profits privatized.   Michael   Sheldon of RDM Financial Group said that this is probably the right action to   bail out AIG. Bailout may not be the right word. Bridge loan is the proper   word. If we look at AIG's tentacles, they reach around the world. They touch   all kinds of sectors and companies around the world. If it was left to fail,   the effect of financial markets would be bad.   Meanwhile sources say, Tata AIG Life and   Tata AIG General, AIG's largest business operations in India, have more than   required solvency margins in Indian insurance JVs. Tata AIG insurance JVs   together has nearly Rs 1500 crores in capital. Tata AIG policyholders &amp;   employees are safe &amp; secure. Solvency in life insurance at 305%; general   insurance at 176%. IRDA guidelines requires insurance business maintain 150%   solvency margins. Tata AIG policyholders &amp; employees are safe &amp;   secure. Insurance business fully funded as of now; no risk to business &amp;   policyholders. India insurance JV's employ nearly 9000 employees &amp; there   is no risk to staff. AIG India watching US situation on other businesses like   PE, Asset management, Cons finance.
