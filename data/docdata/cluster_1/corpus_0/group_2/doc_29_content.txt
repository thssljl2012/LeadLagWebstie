Any1 have any AIG/AIA Insurance???  Today's news! ****CLICK****   A gf of mine frm AIA SMSed me this morning,  "U are rest assured that my Co, AIA Spore, is not affected by the AIG Issue. Anyway AIG have assets worth more than TRILLION. (Oh is that true?) In Spore we must maintain sufficient &amp;amp; separate fund to ensure solvency &amp;amp; stability.  U may want to refer to Business Times pg 5 and Straits Times A8 on assurance AIA policyholders.  Thus no impact on our policyholders!"  Then another bf emailed me this yest.,  "Dear valued Clients and Policyholders,  I would like to assure you with utmost confidence that AIA &amp;amp; AIG based in Singapore is unaffected by the financial crisis in the United States.  I have attached 2 articles taken from The Straits Times (16 September 08) and the Business Times (15 September 08)."  ****CLICK****   ****CLICK****
