Since I work in the insurance industry, I pay more attention to this news lately as it is indirectly directly affecting the industry. The 1st question that people will ask me is &amp;quot;What will happen to AIG in Malaysia?&amp;quot; As a normal individual with some financial knowledge background, I will said, AIG in Malaysia is pretty safe as it is being protected and regulated by Bank Negara Malaysia. Then people will start to ask, is Bank Negara Malaysia sure guarantee safe? #@%@!&amp;amp;)!*@#$! Well, if you are interested, the are more articles about AIG in www.cfo.com and also The Economist.
