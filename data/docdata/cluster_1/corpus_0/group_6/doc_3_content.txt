Back on December 5, 2008, I last talked about a proposal by bailed-out insurance giant American International Group (AIG) to issue special retention payments to staff. From that post: Bloombergs Hugh Son talked more about insurance giant AIG and their proposed retention payments yesterday. Son wrote: American International Group Inc., whose bonuses and perks drew fire from lawmakers after the insurer accepted a federal bailout, will make special retention payments that more than double the salaries of some senior managers, according to a person familiar with the matter. Some executives among 130 recipients will get more than $500,000, about 200 percent of their salaries, to stay through 2009, said the person, who declined to be named because the information hasnt been publicly disclosed. An undetermined number of lower-paid employees will also get cash awards to dissuade them from quitting, the person said.  Well, now info about the retention pay has been disclosed. Bloombergs Son wrote this morning: American International Group Inc., the insurer bailed out by the U.S., is giving executives and employees at least $619 million in retention pay, $150 million more than previously disclosed. AIG is spending the money to prevent about 4,200 employees from quitting, the insurer said in a document given today to U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings. New York-based AIG disclosed in a November regulatory filing that it was paying $469 million for at least 2,231 employees. Chief Executive Officer Edward Liddy is trying to dissuade employees from leaving units that must be sold to repay the government. Seeing that the U.S. financial sector lost 260,110 jobs in 2008, once again I have to ask, where exactly would AIG employees be leaving to?
