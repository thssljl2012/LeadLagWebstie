The board that oversees state employees voted Wednesday to request investigation of a pension deal between the Alabama State Employees Association and Nationwide Life Insurance Co. The vote by the Alabama State Personnel Board followed a lawsuit filed by a pair of state employees against the association and Columbus, Ohio-based Nationwide. The suit claims that the employees union agreed to a bad deal for state workers and received millions from Nationwide in return. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m worried about the 11,000 state employees and how these funds have managed to be kept a secret,&amp;#8221; said personnel board member John McMillan. &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s just a very distinct line between right and wrong.&amp;#8221; McMillan said the investigations conducted by four agencies, including the attorney general&amp;#8217;s office, could result in financial penalties or even criminal prosecution.
