AIG which was bailed out by the government is selling buinsess units to raise cash to pay back the government for its bailout of the massive insurance company. See Associated Press story. Apparently AIG&amp;#8217;s insurance subsidiaries are all healthy and the difficulties stemmed from the parent company&amp;#8217;s division which got involved in insuring mortgages. It looks like that possibly the life insurance subsidiaries will be sold off
