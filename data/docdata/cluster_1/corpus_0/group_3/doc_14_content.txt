Shortly after the news of the AIG bailout of $84 BILLION, a worker at the St. Regis resort emailed a copy of AIG's invoice for their celebration party.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A party for their top performers that would total $443,343.00, included nearly $10,000 in alcohol, $25,000 in spa treatments, and $7,000 in golf.&amp;nbsp; After the report of this came out, the powers that be voted another $38 BILLION for AIG.So we have $122,000,000,000.00 of taxpayer dollars for an inept company that has given a pretty clear signal that they can turn gold into lead.&amp;nbsp; I wonder how long it will be before Fannie and Freddie have a $7 million dollar party to celebrate their bailout and one-up AIG?Here is a link at the smoking gun if the attachment can't be opened by your computer...http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/1007083aig1.htmlHere is a letter from AIG defending their party...http://abcnews.go.com/images/Blotter/LET%20Liddy_paulson.pdfReading it makes you really understand why AIG is a FAILED BUSINESS. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "of the more than 100 attendees, only 10 were employees of one of our insurance subsidiaries who attended to represent their company"&amp;nbsp; (over 40 grand per employee!)&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; "While this sort of gathering has been standard practice in our industry for many years..."&amp;nbsp; AIG sells insurance in at least 8 other countries.&amp;nbsp; They also carry terrorism insurance in Pakistan.&amp;nbsp; (not a joke)&amp;nbsp; AIG was being investigated for accounting scandals in 2005.Here are 24 other insurance companies owned by AIG...(boring list)...They include 21st Century Casualty Co.; 21st Century Insurance Co.; AIG Casualty Co.; AIG Centennial Insurance Co.; AIG Premier Insurance Co.; AIU Insurance Co.; American General Indemnity Co.; American Home Assurance Co.; American International Insurance Co. of California Inc.; Birmingham Fire Insurance Co. of Pennsylvania; Commerce And Industry Insurance Co.; GE Auto &amp;amp; Home Assurance Co.; GE Indemnity Insurance Co.; Granite State Insurance Co.; Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Co.; Insurance Co. of the State of Pennsylvania; Landmark Insurance Co.; National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa; New Hampshire Insurance Co.; Pacific Assurance; Putnam Reinsurance Co.; Transatlantic Reinsurance Co.; United Guaranty Commercial Insurance Co. of North Carolina; United Guaranty Credit Insurance Co.; United Guaranty Residential Insurance Co.; and Yosemite Insurance CoPacific assurance offers high risk insurance to costal properties.&amp;nbsp; You know the 3 Million dollar condos built right on the coast, where they are destroyed every other year by a hurricane??&amp;nbsp; Do you realize the taxpayer just paid for the insurance for all these millionaires!AIG owns and develops property in 12 different countries.&amp;nbsp; Including a ski resort, Stowe Mountain, that underwent a $300 Million expansion in 2005.So what is the real reason for this bailout of AIG???&amp;nbsp; Who really knows.&amp;nbsp; I'm sure there are some campaign favors going on.&amp;nbsp; Is that enough to support a huge bailout for a poorly run company??&amp;nbsp; Sure they&amp;nbsp; have a stake in the Manchester United football team and the Japanese tennis open, but is that why we bail them out??Maybe you can remember the Dubai Ports deal???&amp;nbsp; When Dubai Ports World bought out P&amp;amp;O from England, they acquired control of (memory fails me here) I think 24, major US ports.&amp;nbsp; Congress threatened to block the sale of our ports to an Arab nation, and Dubai Ports World decided to sell the American ports.&amp;nbsp; It was initially disclosed that Dubai Ports world was selling the American ports to a "US entity" for an undisclosed sum.&amp;nbsp; That entity, was AIG.
