Watching the chairman of Lehman squirm yesterday when asked about his half-billion dollars in pay was fun, but the fact AIG execs are already back to the high-flying lifestyle is simply infuriating. After Bailout, AIG Executives Head to Resort: Less than a week after the federal government offered an $85 billion bailout to insurance giant AIG, the company held a week-long retreat for its executives at the luxury St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif., running up a tab of $440,000, Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) said today at the the opening of a House committee hearing about the near-failure of the insurance giant. Showing a photograph of the resort, Waxman said the executives spent $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 for the spa. &amp;#8220;Less than a week after the taxpayers rescued AIG, company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation,&amp;#8221; Waxman said. &amp;#8220;We will ask whether any of this makes sense. &amp;#8220; Waxman should press for criminal investigations as to whether the bailout made this illegal. And, if it didn&amp;#8217;t, then we should make it illegal until these companies have paid back every penny of taxpayer money with interest.
