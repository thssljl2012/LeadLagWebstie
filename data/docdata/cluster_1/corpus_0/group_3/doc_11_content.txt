You should be! AIG first ask the government to bail them out and they did, to the tune $85 billion on September 16th. On September 22, AIG spends over $440,000 to treat their top independent insurance agents to a nice luxurious week at a fabulous resort, Pacific Ocean view, spa and golf included. They continue to give Joseph Cassano, the financial products manager terminated in March, a $1 million a month retainer fee and former CEO Martin J. Sullivan will still be getting his $5 million performance bonus even though the ill-fated investments bringing down AIG took place during most of his three year tenure. Now AIG is being given another $37.8 billion Federal loan. The government should not be giving or loaning them more money, they should be demanding all of it back.
