Last month (Sept. 16, 2008) the American taxpayers bailed out insurance giant American International Group (AIG) to the tune of $85 billion dollars. So, asked "what ya' goin' do now after the bailout?" top executives said "party it up at the St. Regis Resort Monarch Beach (Dana Point, CA) for a week (September 22 - 30, 2008). Total costs? Invoice: $443,343.71. "$200,000 dollars for hotel rooms. Almost $150,000 for catered banquets. AIG spent $23,000 at the hotel spa and another $1,400 at the salon." Said Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD): "They were getting manicures, facials, pedicures and massages while American people were footing the bill. And they spent another $10,000 dollars for I dont know what this is, leisure dining. Bars?" [ cf Screw Disneyland. We're Going to the St. Regis Resort Monarch Beach! ]Once again the wailing of those who are clearly not willing to support the President To Support The Troops!!!!Remember in a time of Tax Cuts the most important thing is to pretend that everything is being driven by war fever, or disco fever, or some sort of disease driven madness....So if you have to do your part in the trumped up wars, then remember thatPower Shopping Defeats The Enemy!!!!Anything less and the terrorists win...Remember it is what the Holy Warriors are fighting for....
