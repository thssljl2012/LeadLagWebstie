They said American International Group was too big to fail, necessitating last month&amp;#8217;s $85 billion loan from the federal government. But at what point does AIG become too fiscally irresponsible to save? First came news that just days after that bailout, AIG&amp;#8217;s main U.S. life insurance subsidiary spent $440,000 on a California spa and golf retreat for insurance agents - an event that White House press secretary Dana Perino rightly called &amp;#8220;pretty despicable&amp;#8221; Wednesday and that prompted Barack Obama to say during Tuesday&amp;#8217;s debate that &amp;#8220;the Treasury should demand that money back and those executives should be fired.&amp;#8221; Then this week the Federal Reserve agreed to loan AIG up to $37.8 billion, on top of the $61 billion it had tapped as of Sept. 30 from the other bailout. Enough already.
