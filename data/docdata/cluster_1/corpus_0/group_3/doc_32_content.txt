From ABC News Today:  &amp;nbsp;  http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=5973452&amp;amp;page=1  &amp;nbsp;  Less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach,  California, Congressional investigators revealed today.  "Rooms at this resort can cost over $1,000 a night," Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) said this morning as his committee continued its investigation of Wall Street and its CEOs.   AIG documents obtained by Waxman's investigators show the company paid more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges.   "Their getting their pedicures and their manicures and the American people are paying for that," said Cong. Elijah Cummings (D-MD).   These cock sucking sons of bitches!&amp;nbsp; After the Federal Government bails these pricks out for their mismanagement of the worlds largest insurance company in the world at the cost of $85 Billion to you and I, these fucktards spend almost half a million dollars at&amp;nbsp; a fucking spa?!&amp;nbsp; Getting pedicures! Are you fucking kidding me?&amp;nbsp;   This is beyond out of control.&amp;nbsp; This is a slap in the face to every American taxpayer.&amp;nbsp; These assholes should be dragged to center of Wall Street and tarred and feathered.&amp;nbsp; This has me seething with anger.&amp;nbsp; Over the last two weeks this country has lost an estimated $2.8 Trillion in worth, money that has just vanished because of the financial crisis that was brought on because of the greed and failure of companies like AIG.&amp;nbsp;   Man I really want to punch each one of these assholes right in the damn mouth!&amp;nbsp;
