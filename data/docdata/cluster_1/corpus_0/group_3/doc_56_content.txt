I figured it would be six months before people forgot all about the Federal handout of billions to Wall Street so that Republican politicians could bail out their golf partners. Turns out, it was only a few weeks: &amp;#8220;Less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, Congressional investigators revealed today.&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;m glad I don&amp;#8217;t live in America right now, because I&amp;#8217;d probably get arrested for bloody murder. Honestly, we just forked over billions of tax dollars to these guys and they&amp;#8217;re getting manicures. Presumably, to protect our freedoms.
