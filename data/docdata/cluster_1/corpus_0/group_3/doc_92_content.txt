 ~Big bucks after bailoutPosted October 08, 2008WASHINGTON &amp;#8212; A week after the federal government threw an $85 billion lifeline to insurance giant AIG, the company sent about 70 of its top performers to the St. Regis Resort Monarch Beach in California for a week of golf, spa treatments and fine dining. A House committee acquired a copy of the bill. Here are some of the particulars:- $1,600 per night for the Presidential Suite and the Royal Suite.- $23,380 spent at the spa (most of it on unitemized treatments that cost $210 apiece).- $6,939 spent at the golf course.- $147,000: the bill for banquets.- $443,000: grand total.SOURCEAND TO MAKE THIS EVEN MORE OUTRAGEOUS:THE GOVERNMENT WILL GIVE THEM ANOTHER 37.8 BILLION DOLLARS ON TOP OF THE 85 BILLION THEY RECEIVED ALREADY!!!My two cents: EVERY CENT OF THIS HUGE SUM MUST BE RETURNED AND ALL(!) THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SPA-TRIP AS WELL AS OF COURSE ALL PARTICIPANTS BELONG F-I-R-E-D!!!!!~~
