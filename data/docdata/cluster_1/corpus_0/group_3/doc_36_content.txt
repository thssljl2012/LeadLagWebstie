After &amp;#8220;loaning&amp;#8221; AIG 85 Billion dollars, of which 61 has already been used, the pigs at AIG have decided that they need even more money to stay afloat. The New York Federal Reserve is lending up to $37.8 billion to American International Group to give the troubled insurer access to much-needed cash. In exchange, AIG is giving the New York Fed investment-grade, fixed-income securities that it had previously lent out to other institutions for a fee. Those institutions are now returning these securities and want their money back. There&amp;#8217;s something really wrong here. If those companies borrowed the securities and paid for it as a deposit, then that means AIG spent their deposit instead of keeping the money seperate. If that money given to AIG was a fee, why would they need to give them money back at all? Either way, shows an incompetence on the part of AIG. I&amp;#8217;m so glad the NY Insurance Department was up to the task of regulating AIG. Which of course brings up the question, if regulators couldn&amp;#8217;t handle things before, how are more regulations and laws going to help?
