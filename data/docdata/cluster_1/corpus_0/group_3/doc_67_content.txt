            Don't you wish Congress held these hearings BEFORE giving 700 billion dollars to these thieves in expensive suits?A week after the insurance giant, the American International Group, received an $85 billion federal bailout, its life insurance subsidiary, AIG General, held a weeklong retreat for its top sales agents at the exclusive St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, Calif. Expenses for the week, lawmakers were told, totaled $442,000, including $200,000 for hotel rooms, $150,000 for food and $23,000 in spa charges.In addition, the former A.I.G. executive who led the London-based division whose implosion is largely blamed for the insurance giants downfall, Joseph J. Cassano, continues to receive $1 million a month from the company, on top of the $280 million he received in the last eight years.And even after A.I.G. reported $5 billion in losses in the final quarter of 2007, its chief executive at the time, Martin J. Sullivan, argued before a compensation committee that executives should receive performance bonuses. He received $5 million. A question:  When do the class action lawsuits on behalf of shareholders and retirement account holders begin?  And can they please go after the personal assests of these crooks, instead of what assets remain in the companies they ruined?Labels: bailout, corporate welfare
