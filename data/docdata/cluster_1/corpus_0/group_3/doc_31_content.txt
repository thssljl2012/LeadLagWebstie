The Associated Press: AIG executives spent thousands during hunting trip     Quote:                    AIG officials declined to say which AIG executives attended the trip, which reports have said racked up an $86,000 tab. News of the hunting trip surfaced just days after AIG received an additional $37.8 billion loan from the Federal Reserve, on top of a previous $85 billion emergency loan granted last month.  The company said last week it would stop &amp;quot;all non-essential conferences, meetings and activities that do not clearly maximize value and service given the current conditions.&amp;quot;  Last month, and just days after the U.S. government stepped in to save AIG with a $85 billion taxpayer-funded loan, the company picked up a $440,000 tab for a week-long retreat at a posh California resort for top-performing insurance agents.  Lawmakers investigating AIG's meltdown said they were enraged that executives of AIG's main U.S. life insurance subsidiary spent a lavish amount on the retreat, complete with spa treatments, banquets and golf outings. Last week, White House Press Secretary Dana Perino called the event &amp;quot;despicable.&amp;quot;                 Glad to know my tax money is serving a good cause to help this company out. :roll:
