 aig Originally uploaded by ch_harishanker  AIG plans to sell off three life insurance companies such as Alico in Japan. AIG announced new company&amp;#8217;s basic principles that concentrated management resources on the nonlife insurance business on the third. I hear that the life insurance business schedules to sell it off, and three life insurance companies (American Life Insurance, the AIG Edison life, and the AIG star life) become objects of the clearance in Japan. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Tagged: AIG, Alico Japan, American life Insurance company Group&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
