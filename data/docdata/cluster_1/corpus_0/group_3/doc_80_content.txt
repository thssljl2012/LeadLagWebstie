     have you heard?&amp;#0160; apparently AIG was so stressed about their bailout that they sprung for a little r&amp;amp;r for all of their hardworking execs.&amp;#0160; Elijah Cummings (D-MD) detailed the expenditures which, i'm sure, were totally necessary...&amp;#0160;&amp;quot;Have you heard of anything more outrageous - a week after taxpayers commit $85 billion dollars to rescue AIG, the company's leading insurance executives spend hundreds of thousands of dollars at one of the most exclusive reports in the nation...Let me describe for some of you the charges that the shareholders, taxpayers, had to pay. AIG spent $200,000 dollars for hotel rooms. Almost $150,000 for catered banquets. AIG spent $23,000 at the hotel spa and another $1,400 at the salon. They were getting manicures, facials, pedicures and massages while American people were footing the bill. And they spent another $10,000 dollars for I don't know what this is, leisure dining. Bars?&amp;quot;via Speaker.govin total, AIG spent $443,343.71 after the bailout.nice.&amp;#0160; now excuse most of america while we try to decide if we are going to pay the phone bill or buy groceries.
