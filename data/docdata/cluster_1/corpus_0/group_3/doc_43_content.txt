The first question of tonight&amp;#8217;s presidential debatewent to Sen. Barack Obama, and conjured a genuineOC-grown controversy.Talking about the $700 billion Wall Street bailout plan, Obama said: &amp;#8220;We have to make sure it works properly&amp;#8230;.That means strong oversight&amp;#8230;it means we are cracking down on CEOs and making sure that they are not getting bonuses or golden parachutes as a consequence of this package. &amp;#8220;In fact, we just found that AIG - a company thatgot a bailout - just a week after they got help,went ona $400,000 junket. &amp;#8220;I tell you what. Treasury should demand that money back, and those executives should be fired.&amp;#8221; The Watchdog broke the AIG story on Oct. 2: Less than two weeks after Uncle Sam gaveAmerican International Group (AIG) an $85 billion loan - staving offfinancial collapse -execs fromone of its insurance subsidiaries, AIG AmericanGeneral, gathered for a conference at the uber-swankSt. Regis Monarch Beach Resort, billed as Californias only Mobil Travel Guide Five-Star Resort, whereocean-view rooms start at$565 a night and world class luxuryis the rule. Today, thanks to Rep. Henry Waxman, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, we have the bill for the junket. Total: $443,344. (This is the first time The Watchdog&amp;#8217;s reporting has made its way into a presidential debate. We are rather stoked.)
