Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) said today at the the opening of a House committee hearing about the near-failure of the insurance giant.  Showing a photograph of the resort, Waxman said the executives spent $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 for the spa.  "Less than a week after the taxpayers rescued AIG, company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation," Waxman said. "We will ask whether any of this makes sense. " The committee will ask the company's executives about their multimillion-dollar pay packages -- some of which they continue to receive -- as well as who bears responsibility for the company's high-risk investment portfolio, which led to its near collapse just weeks ago.  "They were getting their manicures, their pedicures, massages, their facials while the American people were paying their bills," thundered Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), of the executive retreat at the Monarch Resort. The House committee, which took on executive compensation at bankrupt Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers yesterday, has received "tens of thousands" of pages of documents from AIG, Waxman said. Those documents show that as the company's risky investments began to implode, the company altered its generous executive pay plan to pay out regardless of such losses.AIG lost over $5 billion in the last quarter of 2007 due its risky financial products division, Waxman said. Yet in March 2008, when the company's compensation committee met to award bonuses, Chief Executive Martin Sullivan urged the committee to ignore those losses, which should have slashed bonuses. But the board agreed to ignore the losses from the financial products division and gave Sullivan a cash bonus of over $5 million. The board also approved a new compensation contract for Sullivan that gave him a golden parachute of $15 million, Waxman said.Joseph Cassano, the executive in charge of the company's troubled financial products division, received more than $280 million over the last eight years, Waxman said. Even after he was terminated in February as his investments turned sour, the company allowed him to keep up to $34 million in unvested bonuses and put him on a $1 million-a-month retainer. He continues to receive $1 million a month, Waxman said. Waxman also looked skeptically at the executives' defense that the troubles in the business had to do with larger economic forces and not their own bad decisions.When a former AIG auditor, Joseph St. Denis, expressed concerns, Cassano told him "I have deliberately excluded you from the valuation ... because I was concerned that you would pollute the process," according to Waxman. St. Denis resigned in protest. PricewaterhouseCoopers, AIG's auditor, told the company in March 2008 that the "root cause" of AIG's problems was that people assessing risk did not have enough access to the financial products division, where the risky investments originated.Waxman further suggested that Sullivan had deliberately misled investors. On Dec. 5, 2007, Sullivan expressed confidence to investors. But a week before, PricewaterhouseCoopers warned Sullivan that the company "could have a material weakness relating to these area," committee members said. -- Peter Whoriskey .. --&gt;  By Sara Goo&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; --&gt;October 7, 2008; 10:29 AM ET &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Category:&amp;nbsp; business Previous: Markets Rally to Open, IMF Weighs In   Next: N.Y.

I wonder what is next.... Posted by: Jan   October 7, 2008 10:37 AM   This is exactly what the taxpayers were concerned about...life as usual for the Wall Street executives while we, on Main Street and other streets, suffer the consequences. Posted by: Barbara in California   October 7, 2008 10:46 AM   Well, it seems like that was my money funding that, but I'm sure they work hard and deserve it. Baa. Posted by: Bedford Falls   October 7, 2008 10:48 AM   AIG Executives slapped Congress in the face and continues to laugh about it even while enjoying themselves at the posh resort. The AIG Executives are probably saying to themselves, "what is Congress going to do to us, nothing". Ha Ha Ha!!!! Congress is too soft and gullible.  What is Congress going to do about it? Posted by: Anonymous   October 7, 2008 10:54 AM   Oh NO! Not on my dime! Congress better recoup those funds and fast Posted by: drihl   October 7, 2008 10:56 AM   How can Congress be so indignant when the bailout bill was crammed with garbage pork? Millions! And apparently, that's the only reason it passed, because some individuals had to get their cut (maybe Nancy Pelosi really does need that 757...). Posted by: ooxomoxoo   October 7, 2008 10:56 AM   This is unacceptable on our money. Congress and Treasury need to revise the rules so this does not happen again. Posted by: Anonymous   October 7, 2008 11:00 AM   its time to roll-out the guillotine Posted by: Paul   October 7, 2008 11:06 AM   THIS IS APPALLING!!!! I can't believe this is happening. Heads should be rolling and they are not. This country is ripe for revolution and if accountability is not found, I think that is the next course of action. The citizens of the US should not be made to pay for the mistakes of the wealthy! If a market correction needed to play out those companies fail, so be it. The bailout should never have happened. As I have read, those that voted for the bailout were compensated, by WALLSTREET, with cash, property, etc.. if they voted YES. I understand Dodd himself got $14 million plus from wallstreet. This just sickens me. Our founding fathers must be spinning so fast in their graves that you could probably draw power from them. Posted by: Gclausen   October 7, 2008 11:08 AM   To say I'm upset is an understatement. AIG executives should be forced to reimburse these expenses out of their OWN pocket. Immediately. Posted by: Upset   October 7, 2008 11:14 AM   There are Senators and Congressmen who go in poor, and when their term is up, they come out millionaires. I wonder why. Posted by: Anonymous   October 7, 2008 11:27 AM   instead of 700 billion the politicians were stuff with pork &amp;amp; barrel and it ended up to 810 billion. American tax payers are new sucker in town. Posted by: you got what you paid for   October 7, 2008 11:49 AM   O.K., Folks. Time to rise up. This is beyond obscene, and we should fire all the executives who are responsible for this event, or take back the $85 billion. Posted by: Pitchfork time!   October 7, 2008 11:58 AM   What annoys me most about this? AIG *HAD* a buyer. That buyer though apparently wanted to have *gasp* controlling interest in the company. So instead they go to the Feds. And then SoCal. I don't know whether to laugh uncontrollably or sob uncontrollably.  Posted by: Chasmosaur   October 7, 2008 12:02 PM   I cannot stand to read another story like this. Tears well up in my eyes. How in the hell can this type of behavior go on? Can something/anything be done to stop them? These immoral businessmen don't even hide the fact that they are spending money in this way while devastating the economy. They are laughing at all of us who are reading this story, writing our angry comments, and wondering what's going to happen to our earnings -- the money we need to live each day comfortably.  Posted by: sickntired   October 7, 2008 12:05 PM   Let's ask Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama about this, in tonight's discussion. LOL. Posted by: RipRap   October 7, 2008 12:13 PM   i'm really glad the Democrats charged into bailing out Wall Street with $700 billion. who would they like to bailout next? China? North Korea? Posted by: million   October 7, 2008 12:17 PM   Can you get a pedicure in Leavenworth? Posted by: zenwick   October 7, 2008 12:20 PM   This is just another dog and pony show by Congress. They brought in the oil executives and the credit card executives and what happened...nothing. The sad part is Congress has no idea what to do!!! Posted by: feelinthepain   October 7, 2008 12:22 PM   Dudes stop the gripe, after all you voted these geckos in... and perhaps amazingly vote 'em in again! The purpose of the bailout was to keep life going as we know it (without the bailout it would be life as unknown), so every thing must continue as it was including all shindigs because hey! people work at those resorts they have shareholders or owners to pay, yatchs to buy, the people building those yatchts need to eat including the guy that cleans their toilets, so check it y'all checkit, now you know who can pay for those million dollar pads and why they must continue to cost millions while the minions weep at their unfortunate lot in this pork barrel feeding frenzy.
