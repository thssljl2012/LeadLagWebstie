Morris writes, &amp;#8220;Equally fuzzy were many reporters, editors, headline writers and broadcasters on the type of institution that was closed, notes Grumpy Editor. &amp;#8220;Most simply used the word &amp;#8216;bank.&amp;#8217; &amp;#8220;That was partially correct &amp;#8212; but technically wrong. &amp;#8220;What confuses things is &amp;#8216;bank&amp;#8217; in the name of the institution. The full name of the failed operation:IndyMac Bank, FSB.

Clouding things somewhat is that since deregulation in the 1980s, a savings bank can offer services competitive with many commercial banks. &amp;#8220;Along with savings and loan associations, savings banks also are called &amp;#8216;thrifts.&amp;#8217; So thrift, correctly, should be in headlines and texts relating to IndyMac.&amp;#8221; Read more here.
