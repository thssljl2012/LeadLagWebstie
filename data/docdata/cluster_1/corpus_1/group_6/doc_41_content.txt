By Deirdre Hipwell   Bailed-out insurer seeks to offload 15 global funds  AIG Global Real Estate has put its fund management business up for sale.   It comprises 15 funds with more than $12.4bn (8.9bn) of assets under management.   The troubled insurer, which has been subject to a $150bn (107.7bn) bailout by the US government, said this week that it plans to divest its fund management business, which operates 15 funds.   The 15 funds have $5.2bn (3.7bn) of committed equity from AIG and other investors, as well as $12.4bn (8.9bn) of managed assets as of 30 September 2008.   The core-plus, value-add and opportunistic funds up for sale comprise more than 53m sq ft of retail, residential, office and leisure space in more than 50 countries.  In the US and Latin America AIG has a US residential fund and a Mexico fund with a total commitment of more than $500m (349m) of equity. In Asia it has four funds targeting various investments in Japan, as well as a general fund that was fully committed in 2005.   In Europe it has a French property fund, a general Europe fund that invests in western Europe and a property mezzanine partners fund that provides second-level finance to UK properties.AIG?s fund management headquarters is in New York and it has 35 offices in Europe, Japan, Latin America and Asia. It is advised by Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, which will handle the sale.   A successful sale would mark the latest disposal by AIG, which has been selling assets to raise capital and repay the US federal government loan that prevented its collapse last year.   In 2008 it sold its commodity index business and property and casualty insurer Hartford Steam Boiler Group. It is also selling its consumer finance arms in Latin America and is considering the sale of other divisions, including ILFC ? its aircraft leasing unit ? as well as individual property sales.   In the UK it sold its 50% stake in London City airport in October for around 250m to Global Infrastructure Partners, handing it 100% ownership. It bought the stake two years before for 375m. Shares of AIG on Monday were $1.32 down 3.65% from the previous closing price.  Bailed-out insurer seeks to offload 15 global funds
