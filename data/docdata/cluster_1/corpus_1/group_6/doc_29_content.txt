Specifically, Lexington's casualty division will manage the public entity commercial umbrella and excess casualty portfolio of AIG Specialty Excess, a division of AIG Excess Casualty, which along with Lexington is engaged in addressing the risks of public entities, utilities and transit agencies.  The company said that the organizational change streamlines access to excess casualty insurance through a centralized underwriting and claims resource for clients and brokers. Lexington, and other AIG Commercial Insurance units, can provide a full selection of insurance products and services to public entities, including workers' compensation, excess workers' compensation, environmental, property, construction, auto liability, executive liability and accident and health programs.  David Bresnahan, executive vice president of Lexington Insurance Company, said: 'Consolidating our underwriting and claims capabilities for public entities creates synergies to benefit customers and improves service which brokers will appreciate. The move delivers efficiency without sacrificing product strength, capacity or important underwriting relationships.'  AIG Commercial Insurance has announced that it will service all casualty insurance coverage for the public sector through its Lexington Insurance Company unit.
