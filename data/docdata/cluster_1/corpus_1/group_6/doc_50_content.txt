American International Group, the insurer that renamed its US auto business earlier this week to prepare the operation for potential buyers, may find that unit among the easiest piece to sell, analysts said.  Zurich Financial Services, Allstate and Travelers would each benefit from owning New York-based AIG's 21st Century Insurance, which sells policies over the Internet, said Paul Newsome, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill. The unit's name was changed from aigdirect.com, reverting to the former brand of a business acquired in 2007.  'Auto insurance is less affected by the current economic crisis than almost any other sector,' said Brian Sullivan, editor of Auto Insurance Report, a weekly industry newsletter. '21st Century is extremely attractive for a buyer that could bolt it onto its own business.'  AIG is selling businesses including life insurance and retirement services in the US and overseas to repay a $60 billion loan that's part of the government's rescue package.
