COLUMBUS  Four of the states largest insurance companies  Aetna, United Healthcare, Anthem and Medical Mutual of Ohio  have stepped in to offer continuous health insurance to nearly 90 people after their insurer, Nationwide Health Insurance, transitioned out of Ohios health insurance market effective January 1, 2009.  A couple of years ago, Nationwide Health Insurance made a decision to stop writing new health insurance policies and transition out of Ohios health insurance market. Since then, it has helped most of its subscribers get coverage with other companies. Nonetheless, a total of 86 people were unable to secure other coverage and thats when the other insurers offered to help.  I am impressed and appreciative of the leadership shown by Aetna, United Healthcare, Anthem and Medical Mutual of Ohio to offer health coverage to these Ohioans who unfortunately were not able to find other coverage when their health insurer left the market. Ohio Department of Insurance Director Mary Jo Hudson said.  The individuals, who are paying for the coverage at market rates, have been assigned to plans based on the persons zip code and a companys network presence. No one was required to purchase coverage.  The decision of Nationwide to transition out of the health insurance market was part of a plan to focus on health and wellness programs for employers.  Anyone with questions about their insurance, whether it be health, home, auto, life or long-term care can call the Departments consumer hotline at 1-800-686-1526 and visit www.ohioinsurance.gov for information.
