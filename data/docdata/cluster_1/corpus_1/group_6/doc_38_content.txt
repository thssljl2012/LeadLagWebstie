(BestWire Services Via Acquire Media NewsEdge) Maurice 'Hank' Greenberg's C.V. Starr &amp; Co. Inc. has entered into a joint venture with Ironshore Inc., the Bermuda-based insurer that has hired away eight top-level American International Group Inc. executives since December.  Greenberg ran AIG for nearly four decades before being forced out in an accounting scandal in 2005.  The two companies announced the formation of Iron-Starr Excess Agency Ltd., a Bermuda-domiciled specialty lines insurance and reinsurance managing general agency.  Iron-Starr Excess will focus on producing excess financial and commercial lines insurance and reinsurance products, and catastrophic excess casualty insurance products, through U.S. insurers and Bermuda or other offshore carriers. It will target Fortune 2000 and other clients purchasing cat excess coverages, with policy limits up to $75 million, the two companies said in separate statements.  In December, the two top executives at AIG?s powerhouse excess and surplus lines carrier, Lexington Insurance Co., Kevin Kelley and Shaun Kelly, moved to Ironshore, with Kelley becoming Ironshore?s chief executive and Kelly becoming chief executive of U.S. operations.  Recently, Ironshore snared the top two executives of AIG Environmental ? Joseph Boren, chairman and chief executive officer, and John O'Brien, president and chief operating officer ? who took the top executive spots at Ironshore?s new environmental insurance facility. Geoff Smith, president of AIG Cat Excess Liability, later was named worldwide head of the specialty insurer's newly launched excess liability facility.  And Ironshore hired AIG?s Landmark Insurance Co. President Steven England as executive vice president responsible for running Ironshore National Branch, its new U.S. property/casualty underwriting operation based in St. Louis, where he was joined by Jordan Gantz and Jim Dowdy, both senior vice presidents at AIG Landmark.  One of AIG?s biggest challenges, according to industry watchers, has been retaining the senior leadership and underwriting teams of its insurance subsidiaries as it seeks to stabilize its finances and reorganize its operations.  The company was saved from bankruptcy in September by a federal rescue plan that has since grown to more than $150 billion, and it has been harshly criticized for taking federal aid while instituting bonus programs to retain top executives and thousands of employees (BestWire, Jan. 22, 2009).  As part of the rescue plan, the federal government received a 79.9% equity stake in AIG, diluting the holdings of other shareholders. At the time Greenberg, owned about 11% of outstanding AIG shares personally and through the companies and charitable organizations he controlled, and had been its largest stockholder. Greenberg has since sold some of his shares (BestWire, Sept. 26, 2008).  Members of the Ironshore Insurance Group currently have Best's Financial Strength Ratings of A- (Excellent).  Most insurance subsidiaries of AIG currently have a Best's Financial Strength Rating of A (Excellent) with a negative outlook.
