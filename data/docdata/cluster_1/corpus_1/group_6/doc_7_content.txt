Sources said that all D&amp;amp;O risks had riders built into them, in the form mis-declaration or non-declaration of material facts. C. Shivkumar Bangalore, Jan. 8 Public sector New India Assurance Company Ltd (NIACL) and private sector Tata AIGCompany Ltd are unlikely to meet the liability claims from legal action against Satyam Computers for financial deception.  Legal action has already been started against Satyam. US investors in Satyams American Depository Shares have already filed two class action suits, outraged by the Chairman, Mr Ramalinga Rajus disclosures. Sources said that Satyam had Directors and Officers (D&amp;amp;O) Liability cover from NIACL, with Tata AIG as the co-insurance partner. The sources said that the sum assured for the entire cover was $150 million. D&amp;amp;O is an indemnity cover, providing protection against a battery of corporate actions. This insurance provides corporate executives indemnity against legal action. These covers are fully backed by reinsurance, mostly through treaty arrangements, with both the national reinsurerCorporation, and a clutch of cross border reinsurers.   Corporates listed in the country and overseas are currently obliged to take this cover, as a protection against legal liabilities. In addition, some unlisted corporates, with cross-border exposures, have also taken similar liability covers for protection against potential legal actions.   Corporates in India had begun taking the D&amp;amp;O cover since 2005. In December 2005, stock exchanges in the country had imposed Clause 49 of the listing agreement on corporates, which setsand accountability standards.   But the sources said given the nature of circumstances involved in the Satyam episode, insurers had a defence against meeting the liability claims. The sources said that all D&amp;amp;O risks had riders built into them, in the form mis-declaration or non-declaration of material facts.   The sources said insurers were most likely to take protection behind these riders. The riders provide for complete disclosure of all material risks in the business environment to the insurers involved in providing the risk cover.   But Optima Risk Management Chief Executive Officer, Mr Rahul Agarwal, said, Insurers have the exit option from the liabilities only if there is conclusive proof of illegal activity. Even so, only those officials directly implicated can be excluded from the cover. However, the major worry was not on account of the Satyam claims, they said. Claim events of this kind, the source said, would have wide ramifications. Such an event would lead to enhanced risk perception of Indian corporates, leading to big escalation in reinsurance premiums.
