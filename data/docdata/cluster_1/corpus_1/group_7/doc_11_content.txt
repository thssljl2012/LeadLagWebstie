Fitch does not rate the $12.6 million class P certificates. The A-1 class has paid off since issuance.   The affirmations reflect the stable performance of the pool since the last rating action. Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction of rating changes over the next one to two years. Nine loans (19.1%) have fully defeased and one loan (1.2%) has partially defeased. Approximately 4.2% of the pool matures during 2009-2010. As of the January 2009 distribution date, the pool has paid down by 11.5% to $638.2 million from $721.4 million at issuance.   Fitch has identified 10 Loans of Concern (11.8%), including two specially serviced loans (0.9%). The two specially serviced loans are secured by a multifamily property located in Hartford, CT, and a parking garage located in Chicago, IL. The multifamily property, which is real estate owned (REO), was transferred to the special servicer in January 2007. The servicer is currently marketing the property. Losses are expected, however, they are anticipated to be fully absorbed by the non-rated class P. The parking garage is current and was transferred to the special servicer due to imminent default. The loan matured on Jan. 1, 2009, and the borrower is seeking to extend the loan for one year. No losses are expected on the loan.   Two loans maintain investment grade shadow ratings; Tyson's Corner Center (5.2%) and the AFR / Bank of America Office Portfolio loan (5%).   The Tyson's Corner Center loan is secured by 1.9 million square feet (sf) within a 2.2 million sf regional mall located in McLean, VA. The mall is anchored by Macy's, Lord &amp; Taylor, Nordstrom, and Bloomingdale's. Occupancy was at 96.8% as of September 2008. Macy's had a lease expiration of March 31, 2009, and has renewed its lease to 2018. In addition, Circuit City (approximately 1.5% of the net rentable area) had a lease expiration of Jan. 31, 2009, and is not renewing. For year-end (YE) 2007, the Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR), including rental income from Circuit City, increased to 2.69 times (x) compared to 1.53x at issuance. The property is encumbered by four pari-passu A notes comprising $325.7 million. The $33.5 million A-2 note included in this trust matures on March 1, 2014.   At issuance, the AFR / Bank of America Office Portfolio loan was secured by 152 office buildings in 19 states that were 76.8% occupied by Bank of America. In the trust, 26 of the 152 properties comprising $7.76 million of the $32.7 million in proceeds have been defeased. The non-defeased properties were 91.2% occupied as of June 2008, compared to 84.3% at issuance. The Fitch stressed DSCR as of June 30, 2008, was 1.47x compared to 1.79x at issuance. The decrease in coverage since issuance is due to an approximate 12% increase in expenses. The property is encumbered by five pari-passu A notes comprising $360.1 million, of which $274.8 million are non-defeased. The non-defeased component of the loan matures on Dec. 1, 2013.
