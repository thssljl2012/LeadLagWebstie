LONDON (SHARECAST) - The Serious Fraud Squad (SFO) has launched a 'preliminary inquiry' into a UK subsidiary of AIG.   The SFO said the investigation, which is being carried out in co-ordination with the Financial Services Authority, is concentrated on the UK unit of AIG Financial Products division.   It said the insurance operations both in the UK and elsewhere were not affected. 'It is right for us to look into the UK operations of AIG Financial Products Corp to determine if there has been criminal conduct,' said the director of the Serious Fraud Office, Richard Alderman. 'We will use our full range of powers to seek information and to speak to those with an inside knowledge of the company's operations.' A separate probe has also been launched by US authorities. AIG said it is co-operating with the inquiry.   AIG has been rescue twice by the US government, which has now put in over $150bn to keep the business afloat.
