An inquiry has been launched into suspected financial irregularities in the UK operation of the American International Group (AIG).  The Serious Fraud Office said the preliminary inquiry will focus on suspected illegal transactions at AIG Financial Products Corporation, a group subsidiary.  The same subsidiary is already under investigation by the FBI in the United States after suspicions were raised last year of fraudulent activities.  An SFO spokesman said the organisation will intervene 'proactively' when it is made aware of irregularities which warrant further investigation.  He said: 'The SFO is co-operating with US authorities who are already conducting separate, independent investigations involving conduct at AIG Financial Products Corporation and with UK-based financial services regulator the Financial Services Authority.  'The SFO's inquiry does not concern the insurance operations of AIG in the UK or elsewhere.'  SFO director Richard Alderman said: 'It is right for us to look into the UK operations of AIG Financial Products Corporation, to determine if there has been criminal conduct.  'We will use our full range of powers to seek information and to speak to those with an inside knowledge of the company's operations.'  AIG is one of the world's biggest insurance and financial services organisations with operations in more than 130 countries. The parent company signed a record four-year 56 million shirt sponsorship deal with Manchester United Football Club several years ago.  The SFO said AIG Financial Products Corporation and AIG are co-operating with their inquiry.
