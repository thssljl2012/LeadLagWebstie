An investigation has been launched into the UK financial products operations of US group and embattled Manchester United sponsor AIG.  The Serious Fraud Office said the preliminary inquiry will focus on suspected illegal transactions at AIG Financial Products Corporation, a subsidiary of AIG.  The United States parent group AIG is one of a number of firms under review by the FBI as part of a wider investigation of the failed sub-prime mortgage market.  It was bailed out to the tune of billions of dollars of US Government money after suffering hefty losses in the credit crunch.  An SFO spokesman said the organisation will intervene 'proactively' when it is made aware of irregularities which warrant further investigation.  He said: 'The SFO is co-operating with US authorities who are already conducting separate, independent investigations involving conduct at AIG Financial Products Corporation and with UK-based financial services regulator the Financial Services Authority.  'The SFO's inquiry does not concern the insurance operations of AIG in the UK or elsewhere.'  AIG is one of the world's biggest insurance and financial services organisations with operations in more than 130 countries.It signed a record 56 million shirt sponsorship contract with Manchester United Football Club several years ago but has said it will not renew the deal in May.  The news was widely anticipated after AIG's rescue by the US government, which pumped in more than 150 billion US dollars (104.3 billion) and took a majority stake in the group in return.  The SFO said AIG Financial Products Corporation and AIG are co-operating with their inquiry.  Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2009, All Rights Reserved.
