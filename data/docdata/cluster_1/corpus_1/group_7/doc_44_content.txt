Britain's Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into a British subsidiary of US insurance giant American International Group.  'The Serious Fraud Office has today launched a preliminary inquiry into the UK operations of AIG Financial Products Corp, which is a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc,' the SFO said in a statement.  The probe, which is at an early stage, began after authorities were alerted to 'irregularities' at the division, it added.  'The SFO is cooperating with US authorities who are already conducting separate, independent investigations involving conduct at AIG Financial Products Corp and with UK-based financial services regulator, the Financial Services Authority,' the statement continued.  'SFO's inquiry does not concern the insurance operations of AIG in the UK or elsewhere.'  It added: 'The SFO's swift action is in keeping with its new approach ... of intervening proactively at an early stage when it is made aware of irregularities which warrant further investigation.'  US titan AIG was partly-nationalised late last year in a US Government bailout that topped $US152 billion ($231.6 billion).  'It is right for us to look into the UK operations of AIG Financial Products Corporation to determine if there has been criminal conduct,' said SFO Director Richard Alderman in the statement.  'We will use our full range of powers to seek information and to speak to those with an inside knowledge of the company's operations.'  AIG, the world's largest insurer before the global credit crisis, was on the brink of collapse when the US government offered a crucial lifeline and took a stake in the firm in mid-September.  The SFO added Thursday that AIG, which has operations in more than 130 countries, and AIG Financial Products Corporation were co-operating with their inquiry.
