There will be no performance bonus for 2008 for former Nationwide Financial Services Chief Executive Jerry Jurgensen, Chief Financial Officer Timothy Frommeyer or Chief Operating Officer Mark Thresher, according to a filing this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nationwide Financial declined to award the year-end bonuses because 'thresholds were not met,' the filing said. The three executives could have been awarded bonuses based on the 'achievement of key financial and strategic objectives.' Jurgensen was awarded a $662,280 bonus for 2007, while Thresher received $1.25 million and Frommeyer $371,035, according to a Nationwide Financial filing with the SEC.  Jurgensen was let go last week by the board of directors of Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., ending his eight-year tenure as chief executive of one of the country's largest insurance companies. He was replaced by Steve Rasmussen.
