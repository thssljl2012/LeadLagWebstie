LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The U.K's Serious Fraud Office said Thursday it has launched a preliminary inquiry into American International Group Inc.'s (AIG) U.K. operations.  The SFO said the inquiry involves conduct at AIG Financial Products Corp., a subsidiary of AIG, and with the U.K.-based Financial Services Authority.  It added that the inquiry doesn't concern the insurance operations of AIG in the U.K. or elsewhere. The SFO is cooperating with the U.S. authorities that are already conducting separate investigations into the same matter.  'It is right for us to look into the U.K. operations of AIG Financial Products Corp., to determine if there has been criminal conduct. We will use our full range of powers to seek information and to speak to those with an inside knowledge of the company's operations,' SFO Director Richard Alderman said in a statement.  The SFO said AIG Financial Products and AIG are cooperating with the body and have offered their assistance to the SFO as it conducts its inquiry.  AIG said in a statement that it began the process of unwinding certain businesses and portfolios of AIG Financial Products late last year.
