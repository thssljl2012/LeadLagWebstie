 page has today launched a preliminary inquiry into the UK operations of AIG Financial Products Corp., which is a subsidiary of American International Group, Inc. (AIG).   The SFO is cooperating with US authorities who are already conducting separate, independent investigations involving conduct at AIG Financial Products Corp and with UK- based financial services regulator, the Financial Services Authority. SFO's inquiry does not concern the insurance operations of AIG in the UK or elsewhere.   The SFO's swift action is in keeping with its new approach under the current Director of intervening proactively at an early stage when it is made aware of irregularities which warrant further investigation.   The Director of the Serious Fraud Office, Richard Alderman, said: It is right for us to look into the UK operations of AIG Financial Products Corp., to determine if there has been criminal conduct. We will use our full range of powers to seek information and to speak to those with an inside knowledge of the company's operations.  AIG Financial Products Corp. and AIG are cooperating with the SFO and have offered their assistance to the SFO as it conducts its inquiry.
