 ANZ has stepped up its expansion into Asia with plans to incorporate a new wholly owned bank in Vietnam and open at least four branches by the end of the year.The nation's fourth-biggest bank has had a 15-year presence in Vietnam. It has branches in Hanoi in the north and Ho Chi Minh City in the south, plus a representative office in Can Tho Province. It also has a 13.9 per cent stake in Vietnam's leading investment bank, Saigon Securities, and a 10 per cent interest in Sacombank, the country's leading joint stock bank, The AustralianThe latest move follows relaxation of foreign investment rules after Vietnam's acceptance last year into the World Trade Organisation. ANZ's group managing director Asia Pacific, Alex Thursby, said expansion in Vietnam was one of the bank's highest priorities in Asia. 'The newly incorporated bank will extend ANZ's distribution to meet the needs of Vietnam's growing affluent population who are looking for more convenient access to bank branches, as well as products such as mortgage loans, credit cards, car loans and better savings and investments,' Mr Thursby said. In an investor tour last month, ANZ fleshed out chief executive Mike Smith's plans to become a super-regional bank, where profits from the region would grow from their current level of 7 per cent of group earnings to 20 per cent by 2012. A slide presentation said the growth projections implied a jump in Asia-Pacific net profit from $182 million in the first half of the current financial year to $1.5 billion. The number of branches throughout the region would treble from 99 to about 300, while the ATM network would expand from 155 to about 1000.
