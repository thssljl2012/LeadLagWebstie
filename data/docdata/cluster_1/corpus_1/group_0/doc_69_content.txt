 A MASSIVE 1.56 billion takeover of supermarket chain Somerfield by rival the Co-operative Group has catapulted the combined company into becoming the biggest retailer in the region, by number of outlets.The joined chains now boast an astonishing 56 shops in south Hampshire, including 13 in Southampton alone.This is 13 more than with Britain's biggest retailer Tesco's 43 stores in the same area.The deal cements the Co-op's position as the UK's fifth biggest food retailer, with sales of about 8 billion and a market share of approximately eight per cent. Nationally it will have more than 3,000 outlets.Co-op chief executive Peter Marks said the takeover would provide 'rocket fuel' for the group's plans.Mr Marks said the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, would be good news for consumers and for competition in the market. 'We will create a stronger fifth player in food and a convenience store chain with unrivalled geographic reach,' he said. The Co-op, which is a mutual company owned by 2.5 million members, unveiled a three-year plan in April to double profits and invest 1.5 billion in transforming its retail estate.As well as currently being the UK's fifth largest food retailer, it is the third largest pharmaceuticals chain, the biggest provider of funeral services and the country's largest independent travel business.Somerfield comprises 880 outlets across the UK, including 14 in south Hampshire, and generated net sales of 4.2 billion last year.Its owners, a consortium including property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz, private equity firm Apax and investment bank Barclays Capital, had been looking for a buyer and were reported to be looking for a price of 2.5 billion. Somerfield was taken private by its current owners in a 1.1 billion deal in December 2005.It began life as JH Mills in Bristol in 1875, but changed its name to Gateway in 1950. This was dropped in 1994 to become Somerfield.Somerfield chief executive Paul Mason said today: 'With Somerfield and the Co-operative Group as one business, we believe that we can learn from each other's strengths to ensure we continue to develop the best local grocery shops in Britain.' Mr Marks said it was likely that competition watchdogs would require the Co-op to sell some of the Somerfield estate, but it was too early say how many.The takeover will result in 'very significant' cost benefits, he said, which will be passed on to consumers. A 'limited' number of job losses will also result, but it was too early to say how many.Completion of the deal is expected in a few months.The Somerfield brand will disappear.
