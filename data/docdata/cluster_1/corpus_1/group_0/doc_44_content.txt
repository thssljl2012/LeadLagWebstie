 THE Co-operative Group have agreed a 1.56 billion takeover of rival Somerfield, strengthening its position as the UKs fifth largest food retailer. The deal will give the Co-op an estimated eight per cent of the UK market share, with annual sales from the new group estimated to be around 8bn. The new group will have more than 3000 outlets, and Co-op chief executive Peter Marks said the acquisition would provide 'rocket fuel' for the group's growth plans.The takeover will result in 'very significant' cost benefits for consumers, but there will also be a 'limited' number of job losses, although it was too early to say how many. It is also likely that a number of Somerfield stores will be sold off to ensure regulatory approval of the deal, with rival food retailers likely to be interested. Completion of the deal is expected within a few months, after which the Somerfield brand will disappear.Mr Marks said: 'We will create a stronger fifth player in food and a convenience store chain with unrivalled geographic reach.'The Co-op unveiled a three-year plan in April to double profits and invest 1.5bn in transforming its retail estate. It is the UK's third largest pharmaceuticals chain, the biggest provider of funeral services and the largest independent travel business in the country.Somerfield comprises 880 outlets across the UK and generated net sales of 4.2bn in the year to April, with underlying earnings of 233m.Its owners, a consortium including property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz, private equity firm Apax and investment bank Barclays Capital, have been looking for a buyer for some time, and were reported to be looking for a price of around 2.5bn.Somerfield chief executive Paul Mason said: 'With Somerfield and the Co-operative Group as one business, we believe that we can learn from each other's strengths to ensure we continue to develop the best local grocery shops in Britain.'Mr Marks said it was likely that competition watchdogs would require the Co-op to sell some of the Somerfield estate, but it was too early to say how many.'We will be working with the Office of Fair Trading to analyse which stores and how we deal with them,' he said.The Co-op's 2300 food stores enjoyed a 4.7 per cent like-for-like sales rise during the first half of the year, while Somerfield's sales experienced 'similar' growth.Mr Marks said concerns over the cost of fuel were persuading consumers to shop more locally.He said: 'In terms of the convenience market, it has been growing at a faster rate than the grocery market itself. People are concerned about time, but also about the cost of fuel.'When they are making a decision 'Do I drive five miles to a superstore or do I go down the bottom of the road and visit my local Co-op?', that's affecting their decision-making.'
