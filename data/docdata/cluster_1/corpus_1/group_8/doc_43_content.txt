WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. government is boosting its investment in embattled insurer  (AIG), providing the firm with an additional $30 billion in capital but also exposing U.S. taxpayers to additional risk.  The Treasury Department and Federal Reserve announced the overhaul of the government's bailout of the firm in a joint-statement. In addition to providing up to $30 billion in additional capital to AIG in return for preferred stock, the Treasury Department said it would convert its existing $40 billion of preferred shares into new preferred shares that more closely resemble common stock.  The steps by the Treasury will be coupled with changes to the Fed's existing $ 60 billion resolving credit facility for AIG. The Fed and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plan to take up to a $26 billion preferred interest in two AIG life insurance subsidiaries - American Life Insurance Co. and American International Assurance Co. - as well as make $8.5 billion in new loans to benefit the domestic life insurance subsidiaries of AIG. In addition, the interest rate on the existing credit facility will be modified to reduce the existing floor.  The Fed and Treasury said steps are meant to provide 'tangible evidence' of the government's commitment to an orderly restructuring of AIG, and that the cost of not helping the company was judged to be too high. 'Given the systemic risk AIG continues to pose and the fragility of markets today, the potential cost to the economy and the taxpayer of government inaction would be extremely high,' the Treasury and Fed said in a joint statement.
