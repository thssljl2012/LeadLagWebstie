It will also get more lenient terms on its existing financing which included exchanging a $38 billion debt obligationwith equity stakes in two international units - Asia-based American International Assurance and American Life Insurance, which operates in 50 countries.   AIG said its International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) reported a 16.5% decline in operating income to $207 million, compared to $248 million in fourth quarter 2007, due to lower aircraft sales and higher interest expense compared to fourth quarter of 2007.

For the full year 2008, ILFC reported operating income of $1.1 billion, an increase of 26.3% from $900 million for the full year 2007.  SOUND OFF!
