SHANGHAI, March 7 (Reuters) - Singapore state investor Temasek has promised not to sell its shares in Bank of China (News) through at least the first half of this year, the bank's chairman was quoted as saying.   The official Shanghai Securities News on Saturday quoted Xiao Gang as saying that his bank had been in close contact with Temasek, which had undertaken not to make any cut in its stake before the middle of 2009.   Temasek owned 4.13 percent of Bank of China in the form of Hong Kong-listed H shares at the end of last September, the bank's stock exchange filings show.   Royal Bank of Scotland sold its 4.3 percent stake in Bank of China for $2.4 billion in January, after UBS sold a smaller holding in the bank last December, fuelling speculation that other foreign investors might cut their stakes.   Xiao was also quoted as denying market speculation that Bank of China might take private its Hong Kong-listed unit, Bank of China (Hong Kong).   Asked about Bank of China's plan to pay 2.3 billion yuan ($336 million) for a 20 percent stake in private French bank La Compagnie Financiere Edmond de Rothschild, announced last September, Xiao said regulators were still screening the plan.   He reiterated that Bank of China would not take part in bidding to acquire American International Assurance Co (AIA), the Asian life insurance unit of AIG.   AIG has been trying to auction off all or part of AIA, but hopes for a successful auction faded as only two institutions came forward to bid before the deadline at the end of last month. Both bids were well below the amount that AIG hoped to raise with AIA's sale; sources involved with the auction estimated AIA's market value at about $20 billion.
