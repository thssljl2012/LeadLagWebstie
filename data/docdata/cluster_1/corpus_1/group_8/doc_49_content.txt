At least seven bosses at the UK arm of the American insurance giant will get the massive payouts.   AIG is paying 117million in bonuses worldwide. The London offices bad loans almost brought down AIG rescued by a 120BILLION bailout from the US government.   President Obama also lashed out at AIGs "recklessness", saying he would try to block the bonanza. He added: "Its hard to see how any bonuses are warranted." AIGs new chief executive Edward Liddy who is paid a $1 salary for 2008/2009 said the payments were fixed in workers contracts. He added: "I dont like the arrangements and find it distasteful and difficult to recommend them to you."
