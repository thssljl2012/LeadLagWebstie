Investment funds sold by Mirae Asset Life Insurance incur the highest total costs for investors, which could eat into investment return in the long run.  According to the Korea Financial Investment Association, Mirae Asset Life Insurance had the highest total expense ratio (TER) at 2.09 percent among 72 fund sellers as of the end of last year.  TER is the ratio of total fund investment cost, such as trading, auditing fees, sales commissions and other expenses, compared with the net assets of the fund. For example, an investor who has 10 million won in net assets in a fund sold through Mirae Asset Life Insurance can expect 209,000 won of the 10 million won to be spent as management fees or sales commissions. Hence, high TER means investors will have less return, as commissions and other fees could eat into investment profits, especially in a bear market.  Citibank Korea came next with 2.08 percent TER. Funds sold by Citibank Korea had the highest TER when it comes to equity funds only. ING Life Insurance had a ratio of 2.06 percent; Merrill Lynch recorded 1.97 percent; and Meritz Investment Bank's and SC First Bank Korea's ratios stood at 1.96 percent each.  When it comes to fund sales commission only, Citibank Korea levied the highest commission  taking 1.249 percent of fund assets. ING Life Insurance followed with 1.225 percent; Mirae Asset Life Insurance recorded 1.143 percent; and Kookmin Bank had 1.136 percent.  Meritz Investment Bank funds levied the highest management fees, followed by Mirae Asset Life Insurance, Merrill Lynch and SC First Bank.  According to the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), asset management companies reaped more commission income last year compared with the previous year, despite investment losses amid the global financial market turmoil. The regulator said that their management fees totaled 979.5 billion won from April to December last year, growing 6 percent from a year ago.
