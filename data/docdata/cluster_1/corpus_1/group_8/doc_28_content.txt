(BUSINESS WIRE) -- Fitch Ratings has affirmed BA Covered Bond Issuer (BACBI) covered bonds at 'AAA'. Aggregate outstanding balance is approximately US$9.4 billion. Fitch's rating affirmation is based on: --Bank of America N.A.'s (BANA) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A+'; --A Discontinuity Factor (D-Factor) of 28.9%, assigned to BACBI; and --Contractual minimum overcollateralization (OC) of 23.9% between the cover pool and the covered bonds, provided through the new asset percentage of 80.7%. The combination of these factors limits the achievable BACBI covered bond ratings to a maximum 'AA+' rating on a probability of default (PD) basis, and 'AAA' after taking into account recoveries in the event of a covered bonds default. The D-Factor measures the likelihood of interruption of payments on the covered bonds at the time of a default of BACBI. D-Factors range from 0%, for perfect continuity, to 100%, for absolute discontinuity. In the event of a default by BANA, continuity of payments on BACBI covered bonds may require a liquidation of the entire pledged collateral. BACBI's covered bonds were issued as soft-bullet bonds with a 120-day extension period. However, the automatic 90-day stay period imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act would delay the trustee's access to the cover pool held at BANA allowing only 30 days in which to realize its value. Fitch's D-Factor for BACBI takes into account this risk, as well as the strength of the asset segregation through a pledge according to the Uniform Code of Commerce; the robustness of BANA's IT systems for the management of the cover pool; and the absence of a dedicated covered bonds' oversight in the US. According to Fitch's cash flows analysis, OC allows the cover pool to withstand 'AA+' stress levels and still repay the covered bonds on time. In addition, the OC is sufficient to achieve stressed recoveries from the cover assets, supporting a one-notch upgrade to 'AAA' of the covered bonds rating. Fitch also considered the stressed value of the cover pool using recent market conditions. BANA has agreed that they will maintain the asset percentage at a maximum of 80.7% of covered bonds compared to the cover pool. As of end-January 2009, BACBI's outstanding covered bonds were backed by a cover pool that consisted of 25,381 performing hybrid, adjustable-rate mortgage loans and fixed-rate mortgage loans secured on residential properties, with a total outstanding balance of approximately US$9.4 billion. The portfolio has a weighted average (WA) original loan-to-value ratio (LTV) of 64.31%, a WA FICO score of 746 and an average 31-month seasoning. The pool is highly concentrated in California (41.56%), with the top five states accounting for more than 62.07% of the portfolio.
