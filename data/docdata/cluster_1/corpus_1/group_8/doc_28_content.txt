United States President Barack Obama has angrily told insurance company AIG it should not pay bonuses to its top employees.  He has called on Secretary of Finance Timothy Geithner to investigate whether there is any way to stop the payments.  AIG received approximately 180 billion dollars in financial aid from the US government after it nearly collapsed in 2008.  On Sunday, the company's new head Ed Liddy announced that it would pay out 165 million dollars in bonuses.   Mr Liddy said that although bonuses for 2009 would be cut sharply, the company was bound by legal contracts to pay those agreed for 2008.
