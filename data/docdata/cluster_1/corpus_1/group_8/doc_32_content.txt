Insurance group Prudential has withdrawn from the bid process for the Asian business of ailing US giant AIG, it was reported.  Pru is said to have pulled out of the auction as the price was too high, according to The Sunday Times.  Insurance behemoth AIG - which is now majority owned by the US Government after a series of mammoth bail-outs - is thought to have been asking for up to 20 billion dollars (14 billion) for the Asian business.  But Pru was reportedly not prepared to fork out more than 10 billion dollars.  Pru is understood to have been a leading contender to bid for the division after it was put up for sale earlier this year.  The Asian operation is one of AIG's most prized assets, with 20 million policyholders across the region. But it is believed the price tag sought by the firm stems from a valuation carried out last summer, before the global recession hit.  Other bidders are also thought to have backed out, including China Life, while offers made so far have reportedly fallen short of expectations.  However, Pru indicated recently it was interested in taking advantage of poor conditions to acquire across the sector.  Mark Tucker, chief executive of Pru, said last month the group was being 'presented with many opportunities in the currency market dislocation'. He added: 'We'll see if it makes sense to our shareholders.'  The company was not immediately available for comment.
