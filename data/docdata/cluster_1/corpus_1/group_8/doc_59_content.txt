Major U.S. insurer Prudential Financial Inc. plans to establish a holding company in Japan in April in view of its expanding businesses here, sources close to the matter said Monday. The Prudential group provides life insurance services in Japan through Prudential Life Insurance Co. and Gibraltar Life Insurance Co., which are respectively overseen by Prudential International Insurance Holdings Ltd. and Prudential Insurance Co. of America.   The U.S. firm aims to strengthen its corporate governance in Japan since Gibraltar has recently been picked as the sponsor for failed Yamato Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo.   Prudential, the second-largest life insurance group in the United States, is also bidding to buy two Japanese units of American International Group Inc. -- AIG Star Life Insurance Co. and AIG Edison Life Insurance Co. A holding company will make it easier for Prudential to realign its newly acquired units in Japan, with the sources suggesting the U.S. firm may consider merging its subsidiaries in two to three years.   A shift to a holding company will also help Prudential straighten up its group strategies over such matters as personnel, finance and brand management in Japan, the sources said.   The U.S. firm's Japanese businesses have so far been subject to a complicated management structure. Prudential Life Insurance, which markets policies mainly in urban areas, is part of the Prudential group's overseas segment, while Gibraltar, which mostly focuses on rural areas in Japan, is supervised directly by the parent's management.   Prudential operates in over 30 countries and managed about $558 billion in total assets as of the end of 2008. It launched its Japanese unit, Prudential Life Insurance, in 1987.
