Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty, seeking to allay consumer concerns, this morning said all of American International Group's 46 insurance subsidiaries operating in Florida remain solvent and urged policyholders to continue to pay their premiums.'I assure you that, if it should become necessary, we will immediately intervene if we feel that any one of the AIG companies operating in Florida will be unable to pay its claims and fulfill the promises made to its policyholders,'' McCarty said in a statement.More Business Mortgage rates Consumer Q&amp;amp;A column NEWBusiness BlogsShare This StoryHe said AIG's problems appear to be with its holding companies - not its insurance companies - and the issue is being resolved by a $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve Bank.The massive and controversial bailout, the second in as many weeks, gives the federal government primary control of the world's largest insurance company.The Fed agreed to takeover the company because of concerns that AIG's potential failure could trigger a worldwide financial collapse.McCarty's statement this morning followed Florida officials' efforts Tuesday to put distance between the state's $226 billion investment portfolio and AIG, as well as other troubled firms.Bob Milligan, the state's acting investment chief, said Florida has more than $2.6 billion invested in Lehman, Washington Mutual, American International Group Inc., Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. and Bank of America, which bought Merrill Lynch over the weekend.
