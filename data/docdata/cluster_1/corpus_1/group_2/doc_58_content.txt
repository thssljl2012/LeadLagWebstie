Insurance giant American International Group (AIG) will receive an $85 billion bailout in a move orchestrated by the Federal Reserve Board. The deal will grant the Fed a 79.9% stake in the insurer and allow it to remove key officials at the New York-based firm. According to published reports, measures are already being taken to replace AIG's chief executive Robert Willumstad with Edward Liddy, former head of Allstate Corp. 'We commend the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department for taking this decisive action to address AIG's liquidity needs and broader financial market concerns," the firm said in a statement on its Web site. "We thank them for their leadership during this critical time for the global financial markets. We also thank Governor [David] Paterson, Commissioner [Eric] Dinallo, Commissioner [Joel] Ario, the other state Commissioners, and the Office of Thrift Supervision for their willingness to assist AIG. AIG will repay the loan in full with proceeds from the sales of some of its assets. For more information on related topics, visit the following channels:Industry At A Glance
