Robert Graham, a General Re senior vice president and assistant general counsel, leaves U.S. District Court in Hartford, after a pre-sentencing hearing Thursday. Graham was convicted in February of conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission.HARTFORD -- Prosecutors attempted to convince a federal judge Thursday to consider investor losses as great as $1.4 billion when sentencing five insurance executives convicted of a scheme to manipulate the financial statements of AIG, the world's largest insurance company.Prosecutors told U.S. District Court Judge Christopher Droney that many investors lost money as a result of the scandal, and that the loss should be considered when passing sentence.They cited studies by an expert that concluded the fraud-related losses to AIG shareholders totaled $543 million to $1.4 billion.'Our position is simple,' said Eric Glover, an assistant U.S. attorney. 'Because finding every victim and rewarding every restitution to victims that can't be found is complicated, doesn't mean that restitution can't be made to identified victims.'Defense attorneys argued the government failed to prove that anyone lost money as a direct result of the crimes.'Restitution requires active proof,' said Bruce Bishop, who represents Elizabeth Monrad, General Re's chief financial officer from June 2000 through July 2003. 'It has to be quantified victims and that has not been done here.'A report by the probation department recommends sentences of 14 to more than 17 years for each defendant.In addition to Monrand, the defendants are former General Re CEO Ronald Ferguson former General Re Senior Vice President Christopher P. Garand; Robert Graham, aGeneral Re senior vice president and assistant general counsel from about 1986 through October 2005; and Christian Milton, AIG's vice president of reinsurance from about April 1982 until March 2005.They were convicted in February of conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and making false statements tothe Securities and Exchange Commission.Prosecutors said the defendants participated in a scheme in which AIG paid Gen Re as part of a secret side agreement to take out reinsurance policies with AIG in 2000 and 2001, propping up its stock price and inflating reserves.Reinsurance policies are backups purchased by insurance companies to completely or partly insure the risk they have assumed for their customers.General Re is part of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which is led by billionaire investor Warren Buffett of Omaha, Neb.Droney requested more written information from both sides by the end of next week before he quantifies loss and determines what, if any, restitution the defendants must pay. A sentencing date has not been set.
