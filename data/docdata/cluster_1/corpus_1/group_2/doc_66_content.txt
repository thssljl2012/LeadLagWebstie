The fall of Lehman brothers might well lead the news this morning, but the situation for AIG is potentially more serious. Systemically speaking, AIG is a much bigger domino.For starters, AIG has written more credit protection - via CDS - than Bear Stearns. It is, to wit, a crucial counterparty in many Wall Street firms hedging strategies. Then theres the fact that AIG is the worlds largest insurer. Trouble for AIG could pull the insurance sector into a deep and very nasty spiral and might well be the knock-out blow to ailing economies.Which is why an AIG bailout is somewhat imperative. How though, can it be achieved?AIG is now asking for a $40bn bridge loan from the Fed.Much as the Fed might like to give that to AIG, it may not be able to, thanks to the foolhardy hauteur of AIGs executives. As the WSJs  and also RBS analysts note, the Fed has the power to broaden access to its discount-window lending facilities under Section 13, Paragraph 3 of the Federal Reserve Act. The circumstances must, though, be extreme. Check.Here though, is the rub (emphasis ours):The Act states that before agreeing to a loan the Federal reserve bank shall obtain evidence that such individual, partnership, or corporation is unable to secure adequate credit accommodations from other banking institutions. Which rather puts the Fed in a hard spot. As Real Time Economics reports:AIG turned down a capital infusion from a group of private-equity firms led by J.C. Flowers &amp;amp; Co. because an option tied to the offer would have effectively given them control of the company.AIG then afterall just has to lump a PE bailout at a steep (now steeper?) discount. Asset sales - the other alternative pusued right now - might prove equally fruitless. Where is the appetite to buy? Bear in mind that even if private equity firms succeed in moving on AIG, it may prove a bottomless pit. Buyout firms might have the wherewithall, but if more cash is needed, will they have the means? All thats left then is to draw attention to an exceptionally prescient call from Goldman Sachs analysts barely a month ago. . At the time, Goldmans analysis was derided as being rather melodramatic. Citi, among others, had a much more sanguine outlook for the insurer.
