 Sundar MMADURAI: The All-India Insurance Employees Association will launch a nationwide strike the day after the Union Government tables the Bill to increase foreign direct investment in the insurance sector from 26 per cent to 49 per cent. Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the 30th general conference of the South Zone Insurance Employees Federation here on Monday, general secretary K. Venugopal said the association could not allow the government to hand over the huge domestic savings to private and multi-national companies. Pointing to the remarks of J. Harinarayana, Chairman of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority, that the Tata Group had sufficient resources to take over the share of the AmericanGroup in their joint venture insurance company, Mr. Venugopal wondered where was the need for the increase in investment when the Indian partners were in a position to infuse more capital. The association would take part in a nationwide protest on September 25, when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will meet President George Bush to discuss the Indo-U.S. nuclear deal.
