All products are written by insurance company subsidiaries of American International Group. Coverage may not be available in all jurisdictions and is subject to actual policy language. Non-insurance products and services may be provided by independent third parties.Rhonda Prussack, executive vice president and fiduciary liability product manager of AIG Executive Liability at AIG, said: 'Worldwide, huge segments of the population are nearing retirement. At the same time, benefits are being cut and losses are mounting in retirement plans, triggering a rise in litigation. Because individuals who manage these plans can be held personally liable to restore losses to the plan, it is crucial for fiduciaries with global interests to retain PTL coverage.'
