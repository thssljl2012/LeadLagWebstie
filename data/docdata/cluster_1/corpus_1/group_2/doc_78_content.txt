  LOUISVILLE, Ky. &amp;amp; PHOENIX --(Business Wire)-- With third party administrators (TPAs) nationwide seeking to expand their service offerings beyond insurance claims and transaction processing to a strategic advisory role, SHPS (www.carewisehealth.com) will present 'Helping Employers Become Better Risk Managers: What Every TPA Should Know' at the Self-Insurance Institute of America's (SIIA) 28th Annual National Educational Conference &amp;amp; Expo, Monday, October 6, 2008, 10:15 am, JW Marriott Desert Ridge Resort, Phoenix, Ariz. (www.siia.org) SHPS, a leading provider of health improvement and health benefits solutions, will articulate ways that TPAs can leverage claims data into a superior turnkey care management service that identifies the unique clinical risks driving a population's costs, is outcomes-based, and is the foundation for an integrated care management strategy.        Co-presenters Penny Moore, senior vice president, Channel Healthcare, and Gregg Bond, vice president, Channel Sales, will lead the discussion and present findings from the 2007 SHPS Health Practices Study (www.carewisehealth.com/corp/publications/order_healthstudy.stm), which examines effective strategies for lowering healthcare costs and demonstrates that using wellness promotion and education as a primary health management strategy results in higher overall healthcare costs. 'As an independent, objective and trusted resource for TPAs, SHPS is uniquely positioned to share its care management expertise in the development of an overall healthcare strategy -- the single most effective step in managing healthcare cost trends,' says Moore, noting that the SHPS' Carewise Integrated Care Management is a total population approach that combines health metrics and disease, case, and utilization management.
