The department is coordinating efforts with other states in which AIG conducts business and with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to monitor the ongoing operations of the company. At this time, there exists no indication that the company would not be able to pay consumers insurance claims as those arise, the state insurance department said. The 71 state-regulated insurance companies within AIG did not receive a bailout; they are financially solvent, NAIC President Sandy Praeger said in a statement. The federal bailout of the non-insurance portions of AIG does not negatively change the solvency strength of its insurance subsidiaries. Our top priority was to take whatever steps necessary to protect the ability of the insurance companies to pay claims, as well as to assist the federal government in their efforts to stabilize the broader market. The Missouri Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration is responsible for consumer protection through the regulation of financial industries and professionals.
