American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG), a company that provides insurance and financial services, reported on 26 September that a definitive agreement was signed by the company for a two year, USD85bn revolving credit facility with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on 23 September 2008, whereby AIG will issue a new series of convertible participating serial preferred stock to a trust that will hold the preferred stock for the benefit of the US Treasury.  Holding about, but not more than, 79.9% of the aggregate shareholder voting power, the preferred stock would normally require approval of shareholders according to the Shareholder Approval Policy of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The Audit Committee of the board of AIG has decided that this delay would seriously jeopardize the financial viability of AIG. The Audit Committee therefore followed an exception provided for in the NYSE's Shareholder Approval Policy for such a situation and the NYSE accepted AIG's application of the exception.  AIG is mailing all shareholders notifying them of its intention to issue the preferred stock without seeking their approval. AIG will proceed to issue the preferred stock when it has received all material approvals of governmental authorities required for the issuance.
