NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch maintains the 'A+' rating on four Merrill Lynch gas prepaid revenue bond transactions and revises the Rating Watch to Evolving from Negative. The ratings reflect Fitch's rating action on Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. Inc (MER, the supplier's guarantor), following an announcement that it has agreed to be acquired by Bank of America Corporation (BAC). Fitch also affirmed the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for BAC ('A+') and its lead subsidiary Bank of America N.A. ('AA-') upon the announcement. This action affects the following transactions:--Main Street Natural Gas, Inc. Gas Project Revenue Bonds, Series 2006B; --Main Street Natural Gas, Inc. Gas Project Revenue Bonds, Series 2007A;--Roseville Natural Gas Financing Authority Gas Revenue Bonds, Series 2007A; and--Public Authority for Colorado Energy Gas Purchase Revenue Bonds, Series 2008.Fitch maintains the 'A+' rating on Long Beach Bond Finance Authority Natural Gas Purchase Revenue Bonds, Series 2007A and B. The Rating Watch remains Negative. This rating is under review due to Fitch's downgrade of American Insurance Group Inc.'s (AIG) IDR to 'A'/Watch Negative. AIG is the guaranteed investment contract (GIC) provider for the transaction and is required to post collateral over the next ten days. Fitch will continue to monitor this issue going forward.Fitch also maintains the 'A' rating on the Clarksville, Natural Gas Acquisition Corporation gas revenue bonds, series 2006, and revises the Rating Watch to Evolving from Negative. This transaction is under review for a modification to the enhancement of the customer's insurance policies (provided by Syncora Guarantee) as well as the pending acquisition of ML by BAC. In the event that the customer insurance policy is modified, the rating could be upgraded to reflect the rating of MER, currently 'A+'/ Evolving. In the event that the enhancement is not modified, the rating could fall further into the 'BBB' category reflecting the credit of the weakest participant, Humphreys County Utility District.The long-term ratings and Outlook for the affected gas prepay bonds is determined by Fitch's assessment of each structure, the role of each counterparty in the structure, and their credit quality, including MER (IDR of 'A+'). In each case, bond proceeds were used to fund a natural gas prepay transaction between the issuer and Merrill Lynch Commodities, Inc. (MLCI), the gas supplier. MER is the guarantor of MLCI's obligations, as gas supplier and remarketer.For additional details regarding each of the affected transactions, please see the corresponding reports available on the Fitch Ratings web site www.fitchratings.com.Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.
