Health insurance premiums in Iowa rose nearly four times as fast as wages from 2000 to 2007, according to a new report.Affordability of health insurance is diminishing rapidly in Iowa, according to the data from Families USA, a national organization for health care consumers.Average family health insurance premiums (both the employee and employer share) climbed 72.6 percent, or $4,707, to $11,194 during the seven-year span, the report said.During the same period, Iowa median worker earnings climbed by 18.5 percent, or $5,100, to $26,247.'What's so surprising about this is that the premiums actually produced thinner (health insurance) coverage,' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA.Pollack said higher deductibles and co-payments left families to pay more of their health care costs out-of-pocket as health plans were watered down to prevent prices from rising even faster.The $4,707 overall increase in family health insurance premiums was split by the employer and the employee. The increase borne by the employer was larger in dollar terms, at $3,402, compared to $1,305 for the employee. But the percentage increase was greater for the worker, at 86.7 percent versus 68.3 percent for the employer.The affordability crisis facing Iowans actually is not quite as extreme as the national average.Pollack said Iowa's median wages rose at 18.5 percent over the seven-year period, versus a 14.5 percent rise in median wages for the nation as a whole. Iowa's 72.6 percent increase in health insurance premiums was lower than the nationwide median increase of 78.3 percent.U.S. Reps. Leonard Boswell, D-Iowa, and Dave Loebsack, D-Iowa, underscored the importance of the report's findings in a telephone conference call announcing the results.Boswell called the scope of the divergence between wages and health insurance premiums 'unbelievable.' He predicted the next presidential administration will take some action.Loebsack called the trend 'disturbing' and pledged to work toward a solution. He pointed out that rising health insurance costs are forcing many small employers to drop health insurance coverage.Families USA obtained its estimates of health insurance premiums from a survey by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. It used estimates of median worker earnings from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey.
