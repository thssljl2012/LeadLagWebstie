The turmoil in the financial markets has triggered a slew of questions from consumers worried about the safety of their money in financial services and investment companies.Here are some answers to the most common questions:Is your brokerage account safe?Brokerage firms are required to meet minimum net capital requirements to reduce the likelihood of insolvency, and to be members of the Securities Investor Protection Corp., or SIPC, which insures customer securities accounts - but not the value of the actual investments - up to $500,000.Although Congress created it in 1970, SIPC, a nonprofit, membership corporation funded by its member securities firms, is not a government agency and doesn't work the same as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures bank deposits and is a government agency.When a brokerage is closed because of bankruptcy or other financial difficulties and customer assets are missing, SIPC works to return customers' cash, stock and other securities.If any assets are missing, a reserve fund maintained by SIPC meets each investor's remaining claims up to $500,000 per customer, including a maximum of $100,000 for cash claims.Brokerage firms also must keep their customers' securities and cash separate from their own.Is your bank safe?FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said 98 percent of banks are well-capitalized, representing more than 99 percent of all bank assets.Depositors within the FDIC's deposit insurance limits needn't worry. Even if their bank fails, they are protected.The basic insurance amount is $100,000 per depositor per insured bank. That includes money-market deposit accounts but not money-market mutual funds.Certain retirement accounts, such as individual retirement accounts, are insured up to $250,000 per depositor per insured bank.On joint accounts, if both account owners have equal rights to withdraw money from the account, each person's shares of all joint accounts at the same insured bank are added together and the total is insured up to $100,000.Should annuity owners pull their money because of the government takeover of AIG?If an insurance company can't pay claims, state guaranty funds step in and provide coverage.
