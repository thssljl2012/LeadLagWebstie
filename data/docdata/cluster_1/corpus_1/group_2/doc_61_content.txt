SINGAPORE: For the second day hundreds of anxious policyholders lined up in the hot sun outside the Singapore offices of global insurance giant American International Group (AIG) yesterday, despite a US government bailout of the firm. Hundreds more ? some vowing to terminate their policies ? were already inside the offices of AIG and its wholly-owned subsidiary, American International Assurance Company Limited (AIA). They had returned after lining up on Wednesday without getting served. AIA in Singapore and Hong Kong said only a fraction of policyholders had cancelled, and announced measures to woo back their clients. Many in the Singapore crowd remained unmoved by an announcement from the US Federal Reserve that the US government would give an unprecedented loan of up to $85bn to AIG in a bid to avert a global financial calamity. ?I don?t have any more confidence in this company,? a woman who gave her name as Annie said after surrendering her two policies. She said the Fed?s move made no difference to her. An agitated businessman, Chan Foo Choong, also lined up to liquidate his family?s policies. ?If anything happens, will you pay me?? he asked. Others among the queue were simply seeking answers. At least 500 customers arrived for help yesterday. Still others received queue numbers and were told to come back today. In Hong Kong, AIG?s subsidiary said yesterday that more than 2,000 policies had been terminated by customers who feared a collapse. That number was small considering the company had written 2.2mn policies, said Derek Yung, senior vice-president and general manager of AIA for Hong Kong and Macau. The company said it would waive re-admission charges and a health declaration requirement in a bid to woo clients back. AIA Singapore also announced that customers who surrendered their policies this week can reinstate ?without penalties and submission of evidence of insurability.? ?Despite the queue at the AIA customer service centre, the number of policies that have been surrendered is less than 0.1 % of total policies in force,? the Singapore firm said in a statement. The firm also took out a full-page advertisement in The Straits Times newspaper yesterday telling policyholders it has ?more than sufficient capital and reserves to meet all obligations? and that the funds in Singapore were segregated from AIG. AIA Hong Kong also keeps ?a separate and sound book of its own,? Yung said in the southern Chinese territory. As subsidiaries, the Asian units are essentially separate entities and most were generally subject to local regulations, said Connie Wong, a ratings analyst specialising in the insurance sector for Standard and Poor?s. ?
