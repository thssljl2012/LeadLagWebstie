downgraded American International's (NYSE: AIG) credit ratings, dealing the insurer another blow as it desperatly seeks capital. Shares of AIG sank 61% to open the week on reports the company is seeking between $40 and $75 billion in fresh capital to shore-up its balance sheet, which has been devastated by the ongoing credit crunch. S&amp;amp;P lowered its long-term counterparty rating on AIG to 'A-' from 'AA-' and its short-term counterparty credit rating on AIG to 'A-2' from 'A-1+'. S&amp;amp;P also lowered its counterparty credit and financial strength ratings on most of AIG's insurance operating subsidiaries to 'A+' from 'AA+'. All of these ratings remain on CreditWatch with negative implications. S&amp;amp;P cited the combination of reduced flexibility in meeting additional collateral needs and concerns over increasing residential mortgage-related losses.' S&amp;amp;P also said Mark-to-market losses from mortgage-related investments and swap exposures have placed significant pressure on AIG's ability to access capital and liquidity. They said this is happening concurrently with significant dislocation across the financial markets. Despite these factors, the ratings also reflect the group's strong and diversified global competitive position in life and general insurance as well as its historically strong operating results. Today, the New York Department of Insurance said that it would permit some of AIG's regulated insurance subsidiaries to provide the parent with $20 billion of liquid investments. S&amp;amp;P said this will satisfy immediate liquidity needs, but will reduce the insurance subsidiaries' capital resources, at least temporarily. S&amp;amp;P said if steps to raise more capital are not successful or if mortgage-related losses continue to worsen, then they could lower the ratings into the 'BBB' category.
