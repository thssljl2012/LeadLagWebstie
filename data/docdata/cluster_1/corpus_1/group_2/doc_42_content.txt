Hundreds of worried policyholders, some hoping to terminate their agreements, lined up today outside the Singapore office of troubled global insurance giant American International Group (AIG).Some said they were unmoved by the US Federal Reserve's announcement of an unprecedented loan of up to $US85 billion ($107 billion) to avert a collapse of AIG, which was expected to lead to a global financial calamity.Pentja, an Indonesian, said he had flown in from Jakarta and gone immediately to join the queue outside the offices of AIG and its wholly-owned subsidiary American International Assurance Company, Limited (AIA).He said he knew about the US rescue plan for AIG but wanted to terminate his three policies anyway. He declined to reveal their value.'I prefer to take out the money. I don't mind the loss,'' he said.Karen Choo, of Singapore, was also insistent on withdrawing her funds.'I don't feel confident. I'd rather take the money out and invest elsewhere,'' said Choo, who took the day off work to join the queue, which stretched around the office tower in Singapore's financial heart.Choo said she had two policies worth about 100,000 Singapore dollars ($88,000).AIA Singapore says it has more than sufficient capital and reserves to meet obligations to policyholders. It said the funds maintained in Singapore are segregated from AIG.
