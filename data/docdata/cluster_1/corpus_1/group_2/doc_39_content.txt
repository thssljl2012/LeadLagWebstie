Alabama Insurance Commissioner Jim L. Riddling urged Alabama consumers not to drop polices with the American International Group out of panic.'There are financial consequences to switching policies, and to dropping policies altogether,' Ridling said in a news release. 'Be very sure that you are making a sound financial decision before you ever switch or drop a policy. The Alabama Department of Insurance wants to continue to assure Alabama citizens with AIG policies that the companies writing their policies are financially sound. The financial standings of the companies should not motivate anyone to change their policy.'Ridling also warned the state's insurance sales producers to not use underhanded tactics to invoke fear as means to lure a consumer to switch policies.'We expect the highest level of integrity from the men and women who market products to Alabama families. And we will enforce it,' he said.
