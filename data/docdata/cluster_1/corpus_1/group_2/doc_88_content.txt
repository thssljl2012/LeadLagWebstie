CONCORD, N.H. -- New Hampshire's insurance commissioner is working to reassure residents who are insured by American International Group (track stock), one of the firms being bailed out by the government.Roger Sevigny said AIG's insurance companies are financially sound, with more in assets than they need to pay all valid present and projected claims.  He also said he wants to hear from anyone being pressured by other insurance companies to leave AIG. He said there are reports from other states that AIG customers are being told to bail out because the company may not be able to pay claims. Sevigny said that's untrue and illegal.
