AIG said it has been considering 'a wide range of options,' including selling off valuable assets. 'At the end of the day, it's a real prisoner's dilemma,' Wachovia analysts wrote in a research note. 'Capital options are plenty, but unfortunately AIG will have to likely cut into bone and sell good assets that are earning good returns to support the collateral needs of bad assets earning nothing.
