Insurance giant American International Group neared collapse today, prompting further panic on global markets and a flurry of reports about a last-minute rescue to avert a financial calamity.Shares in AIG - a company with $US1 trillion ($A1.26 trillion) in assets and tentacles in many markets - went on a roller-coaster ride, sliding 70 per cent at the open, swinging into positive and then closing down 21 per cent after a 60 per cent plunge yesterday.News reports said AIG was in crisis talks at the New York Federal Reserve, seeking a short-term loan of as much as $US75 billion ($A94.48 billion) to avert a cash crunch and bankruptcy.New York Governor David Paterson said AIG had one day to raise up to $US80 billion ($A100.78 billion) to stave off bankruptcy.'I think they have a day ... we're in the moment right now as to whether or not they can put something together. I guess it would be $US75 billion ($A94.48 billion) to $US80 billion ($A100.78 billion),'' Paterson told CNBC television.In its first public statement since its shares went into a freefall on bankruptcy fears, AIG said its insurance, retirement and other financial services were operating normally.AIG said its businesses 'including its extensive Asian operations, continue to operate normally and remain adequately capitalised and fully capable of meeting their obligations to policyholders''.The statement added that AIG 'continues to pursue alternatives to increase short-term liquidity in the parent company. Those plans do not include any effort to reduce the capital of any of its subsidiaries or to tap into Asian operations for liquidity''.David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisers, said the US central bank must act to avert a collapse at AIG that would be a calamity for markets that went into shock after the Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy yesterday.He said that although AIG is not a primary dealer with access to the Fed, it 'is a huge global financial enterprise ... That is why the Fed must act.'' Continued...
