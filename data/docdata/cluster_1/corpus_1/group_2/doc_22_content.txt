  American International Group Inc. will be allowed to use $20 billion in assets held by its subsidiaries to provide the cash it needs to stay in business, officials said Monday. The move comes as AIG reviews its operations and discusses alternatives to shore up its business for the world's largest insurer. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that options include the sale of AIG's SunAmerica annuities unit, which employs about 2,500 employees in Woodland Hills and Century City. AIG Direct, which acquired 21st Century Insurance last year, is also based in Woodland Hills. AIG employees said Monday that rumors were rife in the Warner Center offices as they awaited word of their fate. 'We've only been here for three months,' said a variable-annuities sales representative. 'We just got out of training.' The employee, who declined to give his name, said frantic clients are calling to inquire about the security of their investments, waiting as long as 90 minutes to talk to a representative. But New York Gov. David Paterson, who announced the bridge loan, said he'd also asked the New York insurance department to talk with federal regulators about providing an additional loan. The move will allow AIG to use those assets as collateral to borrow cash to fund its day-to-day operations, Paterson said. It also helps AIG by 'giving them what they need most, which is time,' said Keefe Bruyette &amp;amp; Woods analyst AdvertisementCliff Gallant, who added that the relaxation of insurance regulations is 'unprecedented.'
