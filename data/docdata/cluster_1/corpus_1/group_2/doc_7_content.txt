NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of embattled insurance company American International Group (AIG.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) extended losses in pre-market trade, tumbling nearly 42 percent to $2.80 as markets worried about the company's ability to raise capital.The insurer had its credit rating downgraded late on Monday. A complex asset swap brokered by New York state officials gave it a $20 billion lifeline, though the company's rescue will depend on additional funding. (Reporting by Steven C.
