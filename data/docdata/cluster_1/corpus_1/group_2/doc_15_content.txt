The Financial Development Report 2008, which promotes the full potential of financial systems to drive economic growth in developing countries, provides a ranking of 52 of the world's leading financial systems through which countries can benchmark their performance and evaluate priorities for reform.The rankings are based on over 120 variables spanning institutional and business environments, financial stability, and size and depth of capital markets, among other factors, in assessing the complex financial systems of the 52 countries studied.An important and unique measure captured by the Index includes the degree to which businesses feel they can easily access capital.The report draws on data taken from a variety of publicly available sources as well as the World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion Survey, a comprehensive annual survey conducted by the World Economic Forum with its network of Partner Institutes ( http://www.weforum.org/partnerinstitutes ) (leading research institutes and business organizations).The Industry Partnership Programme of the World Economic Forum, under whose auspices this work was undertaken, provides a platform for the world's leading companies to define and address critical issues. Kevin SteinbergSome of the findings revealed by the Report follow.The United States and theUnited Kingdom came out on top as the Index looks beyond these countries' current financial turmoil to discern fundamental strengths in their broader financial systems. The breadth of measures captured in the Index validate the collective strength of financial intermediaries in both countries, including banks, investment banks, insurance companies, as well as robust equity, bond and derivatives markets. Areas of potential concern to the sustained pre-eminence of these two financial systems -- beyond the current acute issues of financial stability -- include such factors as distortionary tax policies inthe United States and the high cost of doing business in theUnited Kingdom.Some countries, such asMexico andPeru, perform better with respect to foundational requirements of sound regulation and the low cost of doing business; yet they have not been able to fully transform these strengths into robust financial intermediaries and markets.China andEgypt do not seem to demonstrate an ease of access to capital that is commensurate with the overall depth of financial assets in their countries. By contrast, theUnited Arab Emirates seems to provide strong access to capital for its businesses despite a relatively lower ranking with respect to its depth of financial assets.Nouriel RoubiniThe Financial Development Report benefited from the guidance and support of its Industry Partners with particular contributions from AIG, Barclays Capital, Lloyds and Standard Chartered Bank. It is the culmination of a year- long partnership between the World Economic Forum and academic scholars, industry practitioners, and other distinguished experts and stakeholders.'
