The Australian business units of the beleaguered US insurer American International Group (AIG) say it is business as usual despite the $100 billion-plus bailout of their parent.However, a local spokesman said it was too early to tell whether there will be any asset sales by the Australian operations as a result of the American bailout.The US Federal Reserve overnight agreed to an unprecedented $US85 billion ($A107.08 billion) rescue loan for AIG, the world's biggest insurer, to prevent it from sliding into bankruptcy.In exchange for the Fed loan, the US government took a 79.9 per cent stake in the insurance behemoth.AIG Life's managing director in Australia, Stuart Harrison, said the move by the US Federal Reserve would alleviate concerns that its Australian customers and business partners had over the plight of its US parent.'AIG can now focus on an orderly restructuring process, while continuing to meet the needs of its policyholders,' Mr Harrison said in a statement.'For us in Australia, it's business as usual,' he said.The US Fed's action means AIG's policyholders worldwide could be assured that the insurer's commitments will continue to be honoured, Mr Harrison said.AIG Life in Australia continues to meet all relevant regulatory requirements in terms of solvency and capital adequacy, he said.A spokesman for AIG General also said it was business as usual for the local unit.As of 1913 AEST, Mr Harrison had yet to return calls by AAP.AIG Life (Australia) is a wholly owned subsidiary of AIG and is incorporated in Australia.It employs 370 people across five capital cities in Australia.AIG General (Australia) employs around 500 people in Australia.Australia's three big general insurers said they had little or no exposure to AIG.QBE Insurance Group Ltd, Insurance Australia Group Ltd (IAG) and Suncorp-Metway Ltd reassured investors as the Australian sharemarket fell for a third day amid concerns the global economy will falter because of the credit crisis.QBE, Australia's biggest insurer, said it had 'immaterial' exposure to reinsurance recoveries on paid, outstanding and incurred claims to AIG, mainly through the US insurance giant's subsidiaries Transatlantic Re and Lexington.The company has no exposure to reported claims nor did it have direct exposure through its investment portfolio to AIG, Lehman Brothers or Merrill Lynch, Sydney-based QBE said in a statement.Sydney-based IAG said in a statement 'Insurance Australia Group had no material exposure to American International Group Inc'.Suncorp has a small exposure in its fixed interest portfolio to both Lehman and AIG that would not affect the returns.AIG employs 116,000 people worldwide and provides insurance to more than 74 million clients, mostly in the United States.
