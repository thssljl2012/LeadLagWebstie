Through this alliance, the companies were planning to release two new products, Nationwide Portfolio Innovator and Nationwide Income Architect Annuity, in the second quarter of 2009.  Envestnet has said that the Nationwide Portfolio Innovator, an individual, supplemental, immediate fixed income annuity contract, is an income guarantee product issued by Nationwide Life Insurance Company. Nationwide Portfolio Innovator is a stand-alone living benefit to create guaranteed lifetime income. This income insurance guarantee will be available for select proprietary investment solutions through Portfolio Management Consultants, the investment arm of Envestnet. It is designed to provide lifetime income withdrawals from the account.  The Nationwide Income Architect is a variable annuity, issued by Nationwide Life Insurance Company, with a built-in 5% guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit designed to complement fee-based managed account advisors' business models. This investment product will be available through the Envestnet Platform as an individual offering, according to Envestnet.  Eric Fowler, senior vice president of product development at Envestnet, said: 'We're excited to be working with Nationwide, a solid insurance company and leader in providing financial security to consumers. Through our partnership with Nationwide, we are enhancing our retirement income services for advisors to help them provide appropriate solutions for their clients in and through a very challenging environment.'  Envestnet, a provider of wealth advisory solutions, and Nationwide, an insurance and financial services company, have formed a strategic alliance to create guaranteed income solutions that can help increase an investor's income potential while reducing portfolio income risk.
