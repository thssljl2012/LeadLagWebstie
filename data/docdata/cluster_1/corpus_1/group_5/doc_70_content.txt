In addition, Fitch downgrades and revises the Rating Outlooks on the following classes: $19.7 million class C to 'A+' from 'AA-'; Outlook Negative; $31.9 million class D to 'BBB+' from 'A'; Outlook Negative; $17.2 million class E to 'BBB from 'A-'; Outlook Negative; $22.1 million class F to 'BB' from 'BBB+'; Outlook Negative; $17.2 million class G to 'B' from 'BBB'; Outlook Negative; $22.1 million class H to 'CCC/DR3' from 'BBB-'.   Additionally, Fitch affirms the following with a Stable Outlook: $24 million class A-1 at 'AAA'; $43.5 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; $60 million class A-3 at 'AAA'; $1.01 billion class A-4 at 'AAA'; $219.1 million class A-A1 at 'AAA'; $196.5 million class A-M at 'AAA'; $152.3 million class A-J at 'AAA'; $41.8 million class B at 'AA'; Interest only class XW at 'AAA'.   Fitch does not rate the $7.4 million class N, the $4.9 million class O, and the $27 million class P.   The classes have been downgraded due to significant expected losses on seven of eight single-tenant retail loans, of which Boscov's Inc. is the borrower and tenant. Fitch placed four classes on Rating Watch Negative after Boscov's filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Aug. 4, 2008 and has closed these stores. There are eight Boscov's loans in this transaction with total principal balance of $133.1 million (6.8% of the pool) only the seven loans with total exposure of $117.4 million (6%) are secured by stores which have closed. The stores are attached to shopping centers, four of which are owned by Simon Properties Group, Inc., two by General Growth Properties and one by CBL &amp;amp; Associates Properties, Inc. The malls are not part of the collateral to the loans. When Boscov's acquired these stores from Federated Department Stores in 2006, the company pledged each individual asset as collateral to finance the purchases. The properties are located throughout Pennsylvania and Maryland.   Preliminary Fitch value projections indicate significant losses when applying estimates of dark values per square foot and the overall negative outlook for the retail sector. Fitch will continue to monitor the status of these loans as additional information becomes available.   As of the November 2008 distribution date, the pool's aggregate certificate balance has decreased 1.0% to $1.945 billion from $1.965 billion at issuance.   At issuance there were two shadow rated loans in the transaction: One Stamford Forum (5%) and FBI Regional Headquarters (4.5%). The FBI Regional Headquarters is a 430,000 square foot (sf) office building located in Chicago and is 100% occupied by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It retains its investment grade shadow rating based on stable performance and occupancy levels since issuance. One Stamford Forum is a 500,000 sf office building located in Stamford Connecticut. It no longer retains its investment grade shadow rating due to a decline in cash flow. While the property remains 100% occupied, rental rates have decreased due to the largest tenant absorbing additional square footage at a reduced rental rate. Fitch's updated stressed debt service coverage ratio based on the Sept. 30, 2008 rent roll is 1.29 times.   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.
