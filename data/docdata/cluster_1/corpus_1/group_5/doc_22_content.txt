MANILA -(Dow Jones)- Philippine conglomerate SM Investments Corp. (SM.PH) and its unit Banco De Oro Unibank Inc. (BDO.PH) have teamed up with Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G.MI), Europe's third-biggest insurer, to bid for the Philippine unit of American International Group Inc. (AIG).  'The consortium of SM, Banco De Oro and Generali is now conducting due diligence,' SM vice-president for investor relations Corazon Guidote told Dow Jones Newswires Wednesday.  She added that Kuok is 'indirectly' a part of the consortium because, together with Italy's Generali, it is SM Investment's partner in local insurer Generali Pilipinas.  Banco De Oro is the Philippines' largest lender in terms of assets.  Earlier, Metropolitan Bank &amp;amp; Trust Co. (MBT.PH), which has an insurance venture with Global AXA Group, and Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI.PH) separately expressed interest in AIG's Philippine unit Philippine American Life and General Insurance Co., or Philamlife.  Philamlife has net worth around $1 billion.  Philamlife officials weren't immediately available for comment.  -By Cecilia E.
