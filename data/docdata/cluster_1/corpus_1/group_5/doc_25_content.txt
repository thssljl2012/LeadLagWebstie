Insurer American International Group Inc. said Wednesday it purchased $16 billion  in investments known as collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, through a financing company set up by the insurer and the government to help relieve AIG of its exposure to the riskiest portion of the credit markets. By purchasing the CDOs, AIG has eliminated its exposure to insurance-like contracts, called credit default swaps, written to cover defaults on the CDOs.
