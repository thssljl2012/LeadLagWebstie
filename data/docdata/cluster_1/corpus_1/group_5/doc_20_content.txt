US-based American International Group has officially put on hold the merger between two of its Japanese life insurers in order to sell shares in these units along with American Life Insurance Company under its global restructuring plans, reported Reuters.  The merger between AIG Star Life Insurance and AIG Edison Life Insurance was originally scheduled to take place on January 1, 2009. In October 2008, the American International Group (AIG) had said that it would delay the merger between the Japanese life insurers.  Following its near collapse in September 2008, AIG announced that it intends to dispose its businesses in Asia including Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines.
