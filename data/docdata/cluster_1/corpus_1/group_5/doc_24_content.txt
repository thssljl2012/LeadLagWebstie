NEW YORK - American International Group Inc.'s first sale of an entire insurance unit since its $150 billion bailout signals that the company's divestiture plan may not raise enough money to settle its debts with the U.S. government.  AIG, which is auctioning about 70 percent of the company to repay a $60 billion federal loan, agreed Monday to sell Hartford Steam Boiler, an insurer of factories and power plants, to Munich Re for $742 million. That's about a third less than the New York-based firm paid for the unit eight years ago. 'If that is at all representative of the market opportunities out there, the value of a lot of other things AIG is selling will be fairly discounted,' said Gary Ransom, an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller. 'It's bad news for the American taxpayer.' AIG's biggest planned asset sales, including life insurance units in Asia and North America, may miss its goal because potential bidders have been hobbled by plunging stock markets. Chief Executive Office Edward Liddy would be able to raise about $100 billion by liquidating the entire firm, 17 percent less than three months ago, said Ransom, who rates AIG 'in-line.' Liddy told CNBC Monday that asset sales may cover loans by the end of next year and that the firm's subsidiaries are 'incredibly valuable.' Spokesman David Monfried said Tuesday that the prices AIG fetches will 'reflect the brand power and the nature of these companies.' Nashville-based American General Life and Accident Insurance is among the operations that AIG has announced it plans to sell. 'We remain skeptical that AIG will generate enough asset sales to fully repay this obligation,' said Cathy Seifert, a Standard &amp;amp; Poor's analyst, in a note to investors Monday.
