I just left the bank and definitely had an interesting experience visiting my local branch. I found  trying to help its owner get a loan. I am unsure if the owner was trying to offer up Fido as collateral or maybe she thought Fido may have a better credit score. But, seeing this today, made me think of what kind of companies could benefit from America's need for cash. The answer is pawnbrokers.  Pawnbrokers provide short-term loans and cash advances in return for collateral such as tvs or radios (just not living things like Fido). Some of the larger public pawnbrokers include Cash America (NYSE: CSH), EZCORP (Nasdaq: EZPW) and First Cash Financial Services (Nasdaq: FCFS).  First Cash Financial Services provides consumer financial services and related specialty retail products through pawn stores in the United States and Mexico.  Cash America International engages in the ownership and operation of pawnshops in the United States.  EZCORP lends or provides credit services to individuals who do not have cash resources or access to credit to meet their short-term cash needs.
