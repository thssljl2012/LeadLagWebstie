Fitch does not rate the $15.4 million class Q. Class A-1 has paid in full.  The assignment of a DR rating is due to expected losses from one loan (1.5%) currently in special servicing. The Negative Outlooks are based on an assumption of defaults and losses on the Fitch loans of concern (7.3%). The Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction of additional rating changes over the next one to two years.  Fitch has identified 9 loans of concern (7.3%) including the eighth and tenth largest loans in the transaction, and the specially serviced loans. There are two specially serviced loans; the largest of which (1.5%) is secured by two office buildings located in Roseville, CA. The loan was sent to specially servicing due to monetary default. The borrower has indicated a high vacancy as several tenants related to the home-building industry have departed. Losses, based on Fitch's preliminary expectations of value, are expected upon resolution. The second specially serviced loan (0.2%) is a retail center in Avondale, AZ and has corrected and is currently pending return to the master servicer.  As of the November 2008 distribution date, the pool's aggregate certificate balance has decreased 4.7% to $1.305 billion from $1.37 billion at issuance. In addition, five loans (4.7%) have defeased.  The transaction has minimal near-term maturity risk as only 2.3% mature in 2009, 0% in 2010 and 0.4% in 2011. Of the non-defeased loans outstanding, 72% of the pool matures in 2014.  Four loans maintain investment grade shadow ratings: Bank of America Plaza (14.3%), Wells REF Portfolio (8.6%), Eastview Mall (7.5%), and the Mall at Millenia (4.4%). Each loan has seen stable to improved performance since issuance. Occupancy as of June 2008 for the four loans were 92%, 100%, 98% and 99% respectively.
