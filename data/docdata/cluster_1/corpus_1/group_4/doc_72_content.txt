China Knowledge reports: A consortium led by mainland's US$200 billion sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp (CIC) is in talks to buy a 49% stake in American International Group (AIG)'s unit American Life Insurance (Alico) in a deal that could be worth up to US$10.6 billion, sources reported.  According to sources familiar with the situation, the U.S. insurer AIG is engaged in preferential talks with the CIC-led mainland firms, including insurance companies, and aims to finalize the deal by the end of this year. AIG hopes to maintain more than 50% stake in Alico, which has operations in more than 55 countries.  If successful, the deal could pave the way for mainland companies to become a major player in the global insurance market.
