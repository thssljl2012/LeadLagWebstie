Nov. 10: The government on Monday provided new financial assistance to troubled insurance giant American International Group (AIG), including pouring $40 billion into the company in return for partial ownership.  The action, announced jointly by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, was taken as it became increasingly clear that an original financial lifeline thrown to AIG in September would be insufficient to stabilise the teetering company.  The $40 billion infusion comes from the recently enacted $700 billion financial bailout package. The government is buying preferred shares of AIG stock, giving taxpayers an ownership stake in the company.  As part of the new arrangement, the Federal Reserve is reducing a $85 billion loan it had made available to AIG to $60 billion. The Fed also is replacing a separate $37.8 billion loan to the insurance company with a $52 billion aid package. The actions were needed to 'keep the company strong and facilitate its ability to complete its restructuring process successfully,' the government said.  I  It marked the first time money from the $700 billion bailout package Congress enacted last month has gone to any company other than a bank.  AP
