BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- UBS analyst Andrew Kligerman on Friday downgraded shares of troubled insurance giant American International Group Inc. (AIG:AIGNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) to neutral from buy. The analyst said ongoing deterioration in the credit and equity markets is 'placing capital pressures on competing insurers' ability to purchase AIG assets,' which is inhibiting quick asset sales and repayment of a $72 billion loan from the Federal Reserve, and also diminishing asset-sale proceeds. Still, AIG shares were up 8% in midday action.
