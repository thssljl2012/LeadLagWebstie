Defaults on privately insured mortgages hit a record 76,776, up 5.4% from August and up 38.3% from September 2007, according to new data released by the Mortgage Insurance Companies of America.  MICA also reported applications for new insurance fell 63% from September 2007 to 62,209, and new primary insurance written fell 71.8% to $8.14 billion. Both represented the lowest monthly levels since MICA redefined its statistical methodology in August 2001. New primary insurance written included $8.11 billion of traditional coverage and $35.9 million of bulk coverage.  The data includes figures reported by MICA members AIG United Guaranty, Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corp., Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corp., PMI Mortgage Insurance Co. and Republic Mortgage Insurance Co. It does not include data from Radian Group, the second-largest mortgage insurer, and no longer includes figures from Triad Guaranty Insurance Corp., which entered runoff in July.  Cure rates -- the rates at which nonperforming insured mortgage loans are brought back into good standing -- were relatively flat from August's figures, with 41,400. That was up 22.8% from the 33,708 recorded in September 2007. The ratio of cures to defaults was 53.9%, the third-lowest monthly figure in the past year and the lowest since the 53.7% recorded in April.  Primary insurance in-force remained relatively stable at $801.3 billion, up 3.3% from September 2007. Suzanne C. Hutchinson, MICA's executive vice president, noted that 'home loans with tax deductible private mortgage insurance are the preferred option for borrowers seeking conventional financing with less than the traditional 20% down payment.' The top five writers of mortgage guaranty insurance in the United States, according to A.M. Best Co. state/line product information based on direct premiums written, are: Mortgage Guaranty Group, with a 24.7% market share; Radian Group, with 17%; PMI Mortgage Group, with 16.1%; American International Group Inc., with 13.1%; and Genworth PC Group, with 11.6%.
