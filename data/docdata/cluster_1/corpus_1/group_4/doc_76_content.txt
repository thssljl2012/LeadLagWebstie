DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  Fitch Ratings slashed its ratings on American International Group Inc.'s (AIG) consumer-finance and credit-insurance unit, saying its long-term support from the insurance giant is in question as the business will likely be sold as part of AIG's streamlining.  American General Finance was given a three-notch downgrade to BBB, two steps above junk, as Fitch also noted the unit's primary business activities 'will remain challenging for the foreseeable future.' That will keep the unit from being able to have a profile allowing it to 'thrive' as an independent firm or be acquired 'on economically viable terms.'  Further downgrades aren't out of the question.  Fitch expects that AIG will support American General Finance near-term, including with debt payments due next year. But the credit rater questioned how long AIG will be willing to continuing helping the unit as 'it remains clear' that the unit isn't viewed as non-core.  AIG has pledged to sell assets to pay off a federal loan helping to keep the company out of bankruptcy. Terms of the rescue package were revised Monday, easing the terms loan and also including a $40 billion investment in AIG and the Federal Reserve lending of up to $30 billion to a facility to purchase mortgage- related investments.  AIG shares were recently up 13% to $2.38. The company on Monday also posted a $24.47 billion net loss for the third quarter following huge investment losses and write-downs.  -By Kevin Kingsbury, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2136; kevin.kingsbury@ dowjones.com  Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http:// www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=IDbR9DERIRN9iLRqXQUEig%3D%3D.
