'On October 10, we issued a clear directive ending all activities that are not essential to the conduct of our business. We will continue to take all measures necessary to ensure that these activities cease immediately,' said AIG in a statement. The insurance giant said its priority remains focused on repaying billions in Federal Reserve loan and emerging as a vital, ongoing business. Cuomo's office said earlier it launched a probe into allegedly 'unwarranted and outrageous expenditures' at AIG in light of the support the insurance giant received from the U.S. government.
