LONDON - AMERICAN International Group, the insurer saved from collapse by an emergency US$85 billion (S$121.52 billion) loan from the US government, has reached a deal to sell its 50 per cent stake in London City Airport to its partner, an airport spokesman said on Tuesday. AIG will sell half the airport to private equity fund Global Infrastructure Partners, the group that already owns the other half of the airport, for an undisclosed amount, spokesman Rupa Haria said. The two companies have jointly owned London City Airport since 2006. When the deal goes through in Oct, it will leave GIP as the airport's sole owner. AIG is selling businesses to repay the government's US$85 billion loan. Meanwhile, a japanese insurer that is a unit of troubled AIG has received 90.7 billion yen (S$1.24 billion) in additional funds to bolster its financial strength, the company said on Tuesday. Alico Japan said on Tuesday it received the money on Monday from its US parent, American Life Insurance Co, which is part of the AIG group, after the plunge in the price of AIG shares. As a result, Alico Japan's capital base stands at 328.2 billion yen, it said in a statement. AIG last week signed an agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for a two-year, US$85 billion emergency loan at an interest rate of about 11.5 per cent. AIG was brought to the brink of failure because of stresses caused by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and the credit crunch that ensued. The fall in the price of AIG shares had raised worries about Alico Japan. AIG, the biggest insurance group in the US, launched Alico Japan in 1973. Alico Japan has been reassuring its clients that there will be no problems with their insurance policies. -- AP
