WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- 'Much has been made of the revelation that American International Group (AIG) recently hosted a number of its agents at a California hotel event that had been planned and scheduled prior to the Federal Reserve's financial intervention with the company. Although questions about the timing and expense of this activity are certainly legitimate, it should be viewed in context.'Compensation and incentives for a sales force occur in a number of different ways --  through salary, commissions, a combination of the two and sales retreats, usually reserved for high-producing agents -- people essential to the continued success of a company. It is important for the public and the media to recognize that AIG's life insurance unit represents one of the company's strongest assets and a motivated and productive agent force is vital to its continued strength.'The American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) is a Washington, D.C.-based trade association whose 353 member companies account for 93 percent of the life insurance industry's total assets in the United States, 93 percent of life insurance premiums and 94 percent of annuity considerations. In addition to life insurance and annuities, ACLI member companies offer pensions, including 401(k)s, long-term care insurance, disability income insurance and other retirement and financial protection products, as well as reinsurance.
