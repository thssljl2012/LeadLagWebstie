As the ailing Wachovia Corporation waits to see whether it will be acquired by Wells Fargo or Citigroup - with, quite possibly, US taxpayers picking up the tab for hundreds of billions of dollars in bad loans - some of its top brokers are getting ready for an all-expenses-paid cruise of the Greek Isles this weekend.The weeklong trip for up to 75 staff of brokerage A G Edwards, which Wachovia acquired last year for nearly US$7 billion (HK$54.6 billion), will also include spouses.This trip comes hot on the heels of another time-of-crisis corporate jolly that saw senior executives of troubled insurance giant AIG head off on a US$440,000 company retreat last month at southern California's swanky St Regis Resort just days after being bailed out with US$85 billion in taxpayer funds.Company spin doctors say away- days are needed to reward and give incentives to top executives.We'll leave you to make your mind up.
