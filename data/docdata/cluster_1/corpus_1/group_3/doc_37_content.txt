MANILA -(Dow Jones)- At least 10 foreign and local groups have expressed interest in buying the Philippine unit of American International Group Inc. (AIG), the local insurance firm's chief executive said Monday. Jose Cuisia, president of Philippine American Life and General Insurance Co., or Philamlife, told reporters that the investor groups included private equity funds but didn't identity any since the expression of interest was made 'in confidence.' Cuisia said that Philamlife doesn't have a say in who will own it eventually, adding he doesn't intend to lead a management buyout of the country's largest life insurer. 'It is not up to us but AIG and its investments bankers, JP Morgan and Blackstone,' said Cuisia, a former central bank governor. Cuisia said he isn't leading a management buyout to avoid any conflict of interest situation. Meanwhile, doubts have been raised on whether there is a single local group that could acquire Philamlife, whose net worth is nearly $1 billion. AIG is disposing of various assets to repay $85 billion in debt to the U.S. government. Cuisia noted, however, that Philamlife represents a unique opportunity for a Philippine company to buy 'a trophy company.' Aside from Philamlife whose business also includes asset management and outsourcing, AIG also has an interest in a Philippine savings bank jointly owned with Philamlife. Cuisia again sought to assure Philamlife investors and insurance policyholders that their investments with the company remain safe, noting that Philamlife is the largest insurer in the Philippines, with total assets of PHP170 billion ($3.6 billion) 'Philamlife remains a stable and strongly capitalized organization. A change in ownership will not, in any way, diminish policy owners benefits and security,' he said.
