We have sought to make it much clearer who is operating in each country and under what name(s). Perhaps equally importantly, our profiles make it plain which multi-national companies are not operating in each country. In Central and Eastern Europe, we profile 22 multi-national insurance companies. In alphabetical order, these are AEGON, AIG, Allianz, Aviva, AXA, Cardif,ERGO, Eureko, Fortis, Generali, GRAWE, Groupama, HDI-Gerling, HSBC Insurance, ING, MetLife, Prudential Financial, QBE, RSA, UNIQA,Vienna Insurance Group and Zurich Financial Services.

In 2007, total premiums in Slovakia rose by 7% to SKK57,680mn. Non-life premiums rose by 2% to SKK28,860mn, while Life premiums rose by 13% to SKK28,820mn.Between now and the end of the forecast period, we expect that annual non-life premiums will grow by SKK46,372mn, while annual life premiums should increase by SKK22,242mn.Growth in non-life premiums should be driven by the general growth in nominal GDP plus a rise in non-life penetration from the current level of 1.59% to 2.80%. Growth in life premiums should be driven by the change in the overall population and a rise in life density from US$210.62 to US$400.00 per capita. Insurance Business Environment Rating is 61.9.
