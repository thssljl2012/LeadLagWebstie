Two hurricanes, investments blamed for quarterly setbackLoading multimedia...Purchase this photo at www.sj-r.com/reprints David Spencer/The State Journal-Register Horace Mann Educators Corp. reported a third-quarter loss Wednesday of $30.8 million.THE STATE JOURNAL-REGISTERThe news was bad as expected. The stock went up.Horace Mann Educators Corp. of Springfield confirmed a warning early this month with a report Wednesday that the company lost $30.8 million in the three-month period ended Sept. 30, primarily through a combination of $45 million in pretax investment losses and damage claims from two Gulf Coast hurricanes.The company estimated pretax catastrophic losses of $36.2 million for the period, including $13 million from Hurricane Gustav and $12 million from Hurricane Ike. The losses were offset somewhat by earnings in other operations.A year ago, the company made $18.4 million for the period. Losses through the first nine months of this year totaled $12 million compared to net income of $64.8 million for the same period of 2007.While the investment losses we realized in the quarter were not insignificant, they are very manageable in terms of our ability to maintain acceptable insurance subsidiary capital and operation ratios, particularly in light of the flexibility afforded us by our existing bank credit facility, president and CEO Louis Lower II said in a statement.Lower was referring to an Oct. 8 decision by the company to draw down $75 million from a $125 million bank-credit facility to assure capital levels of insurance subsidiaries as a result of a nationwide credit crunch.The disclosure sent company stock to as low as $4 per share and prompted a follow-up clarification announcement intended to assure investors and the markets that the company did not have liquidity problems.Fitch Ratings later downgraded Horace Mann debt (AAA to A- and BBB to BBB-) but rated the companys overall outlook as stable.The bulk of the investment losses were in companies that have become familiar names in the national market meltdown  the now-bankrupt Lehman Brothers, mortgage providers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and American International Group.Senior vice president of finance Dwayne Hallman said Wednesday the company has not yet found it necessary to use the $75 million drawn from the credit line for insurance operations.He added that, despite the latest losses, the company investment portfolio remains conservative.We have very minimal, if any, exposure to subprimes, and we have not participated in the credit-default swaps, Hallman said.He noted operations in property and casualty, annuities and life insurance remain fundamentally sound, though he added that the unusual decision to tap the company credit line this month was a sign of the times.Weve always viewed our line of credit as a source of capital in unprecedented circumstances, which are obviously occurring, he said.Tim Landis can be reached at 788-1536.
