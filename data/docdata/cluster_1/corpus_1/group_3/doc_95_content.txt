Whilst the world holds its breath over the banking crisis, last week saw the emergence of panic in the insurance markets as AIG was receiving an extra $37.8bn loan from the Fed backed by investment-grade securities. Rating agencies downgraded the US life market and emergency statements on preliminary third quarter results began to appear. Share prices continued to dip for US major players-Hartford is receiveing a $2.5bn investment from Allianz, MetLife is raising $2bn capital and cutting staff and there were suggestions that the two giants have had merger talks. Prudential Financial and Lincoln National were amongst other US insurers in large share price falls. In Bermuda, XL Capital experienced a 52.2% drop on Wednesday and ACE said it expected investment losses of around $1.5bn in the third quarter. In Europe, THE FSA has asked UK life companies to complete a questinnaire on their investment in corporate bonds. Global players AEGON, Aviva, Munich Re and Swiss Re all made statements about their financial strength. The only comfort came from CEIOPS who said that the current market turbulences have had a limited effect on European insurance companies and pension funds. Meanwhile, Yamato Life was the first Japanese insurer to go into bankruptcy in seven years. The insurance industry is certain to have another unstable week if global stock markets continue to plummet.
