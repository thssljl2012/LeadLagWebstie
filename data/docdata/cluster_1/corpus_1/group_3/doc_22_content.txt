A survey has concluded that brokers are more confident than risk managers in the financial security of AIG's commercial insurance units. According to Advisen, "wary" was how the vast majority of brokers characterised the attitude of their clients towards the unfolding situation at AIG, but with only one respondent claiming that clients are "panicked", most brokers of commercial insurance are confident in AIG after the federal loan and few are recommending clients switch from AIG. The Advisen survey of risk managers found that about two thirds intend to get quotes from AIG's competitors at policy renewal, but according to the broker survey, few buyers have yet given their broker firm instructions to replace AIG. Brokers also opined in survey results about the potential impact the insurance pricing cycle and the potential impact on their fee and brokerage income. "Survey results show that brokers have communicated to policyholders that AIG's insurance subsidiaries are secure," said David Bradford, EVP and chief knowledge officer of Advisen. "However, while brokers have been a force for calm in the marketplace, survey responses indicate that brokers don't yet know how much diversification clients will seek, or whether this crisis will impact overall market pricing or brokerage income." "In conversations with brokerage firm executives the story lines are the same as when we surveyed brokers a week ago" added Thomas Ruggieri, chief executive officer of Advisen. "Execution risk of the asset sales has been cited as a common concern among brokers. They also worry about potential of breaking up the commercial proerty and casualty units. While brokers are watching ratings actions carefully, they are comfortable with the present security of AIG's P&amp;amp;C subsidiaries." The survey was based on 611 respondents, with almost 65% of respondents describing themselves as "executive management." 11% classified themselves as "producer," and a similar number as "marketer/broker." Almost 20% of participants worked for one of the four largest brokers.
