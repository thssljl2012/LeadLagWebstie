The American insurance company, AIG, which was on the verge of bankruptcy before a US government bailout, has been told to stop improperly using taxpayer funds. New York state's attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, has accused AIG of breaking the law by allowing 'outrageous junkets,' after senior executives flew by private jet to a partridge hunting party at a 17th century English manor house. The attorney general, through the New York courts, issued a cease and desist notice to AIG and said there would be no more hunting trips or luxury resorts. Speaking at a press conference, Mr Cuomo said: 'They are not going to have the party and leave the hangover for taxpayers.' A Sunday newspaper revealed that a group of AIG's European bosses spent more than 50,000 on a trip to Plumber Manor in Dorset to shoot birds last week, with several executives using a private plane to travel from Germany. The getaway followed a $440,000 retreat for insurance salesmen at a beach resort in California.
