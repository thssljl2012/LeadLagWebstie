 Major insurance providers yesterday assured that it is business as usual for the industry, saying that not a single company would fold up amid the financial meltdown in the United States.  "It is business as usual. The life insurance industry is not in crisis. We will prosper as we expect to generate a lot of business," Victor Quisumbing, vice president of the 33-strong Philippine Life Insurance Association, told reporters. He said the world market upheavals, including the sub- prime crisis, rising oil and food prices, the milk scandal and the financial turmoil in Wall Street esd more of "a blessing than a curse."  He said major players in the industry, including Philippine American Life and General Insurance Co.-a unit of AIG-were able to act quickly to address the concerns of the insuring public. Only 11 percent of the total Philippine population are covered by insurance. To make matters worse, only four percent are composed of individuals covered by life insurance while seven percent are covered by group insurance. Former association president Peter Coyiuto said the insurance penetration rate of the Philippines lags behind its neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region due to the country's low per capital income. Coyiuto, who is president and chief executive of First Guarantee Life Assurance Co. Inc., said gross domestic product per capita of the Philippines paled in comparison with its neighboring countries. Data from the National Statistical Coordination Board showed that the per capita GDP -the value of the country's domestic output divided by the population-of the Philippines stood at $1,742 in 2007 compared with Singapore's $20,000+, Malaysia's $5,000+, and Thailand's $3,000+.  "Insurance is always last on the list of expenditures while food, beer, and cigarettes are high on the list," Coyiuto said.  Association director Henry Joseph Herrera noted that the Insurance Commission had assured that insurance companies in the Philippines were financially sound and doing well.
