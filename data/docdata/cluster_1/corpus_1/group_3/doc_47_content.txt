The Financial Express reports: The shake-up in the core operations of American International Group (AIG), after its $85-billion bailout by the US government, will have its ripple effect in the financial conglomerate's businesses in India. Barring its two insurance joint ventures with the Tatas-Tata AIG Life Insurance and Tata AIG General Insurance-where it holds 26% each, AIG plans to put all its business units in India, including the nascent asset management business, on the bloc. AIG had earlier decided that it would retain its commercial property/casualty and foreign general insurance businesses, while selling off some life insurance business. It was also seeking alternatives for its securities lending business.
