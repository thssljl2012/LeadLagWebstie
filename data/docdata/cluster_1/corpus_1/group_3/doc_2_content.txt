Washington - The U.S. government may have seized control of American International Group (AIG) two weeks ago, but state insurance regulators and guaranty associations are still fielding calls from panicked holders of policies from the insurance giant.Officials are also stepping up efforts to prevent unscrupulous insurance agents from swooping in and frightening customers into selling their AIG life insurance policies and annuities, which are popular retirement products. Several state regulators have warned agents that such tactics are illegal. Some, such as those in New York and Kentucky, are investigating complaints from consumers.Consumers are concerned about the viability of their policies, said Thomas Hampton, commissioner for the District of Columbias Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking. Weve been trying to be on the forefront about providing information to consumers. Theres a lot of misinformation out there.The most common questions consumers are asking are these: Should they cancel their AIG life insurance policies and switch to another provider? Should they get out of their annuities?The answer: Stay put, regulators say. If you cancel your insurance policy, you might not even be able to get a policy elsewhere, depending on your health. If you pull out money from your annuity, you will probably incur a steep withdrawal fee.The principal thing they should know is not to panic, said John Boritas, executive director of the Maryland Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Corp.State regulators and guaranty associations, which protect insurance policies and annuities if a company is declared insolvent, have been working to help consumers understand that as a holding company AIG might be troubled right now, but its insurance subsidiaries are not, and they have enough money to cover claims.Even if an insurer is declared insolvent, each states guaranty association will step in to ensure consumers funds are protected.
