Just days after insurance giant AIG was rescued by a US$85 billion (HK$663 billion) loan, company executives were running up a US$440,000 bill on wining, dining, golf and spa treatments at an exclusive California beach resort.Just after it was saved from collapse, 'AIG held a week-long retreat for company executives at the exclusive St Regis resort in Monarch Beach, California,' Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.The bill included close to US$200,000 for rooms, more than US$150,000 for meals and US$23,000 in spa charges, he said.Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings, added: 'They were getting their manicures, their facials, their pedicures and their massages while the American people were footing the bill.' Cummings pointed out that AIG spent US$7,000 in green fees at the golf course and US$10,000 on bar tabs.The company denied the bash was an 'executive retreat,' saying the vast majority of attendees were 'independent business people and their guests, not AIG employees.'
