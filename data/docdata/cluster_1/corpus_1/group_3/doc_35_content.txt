(Dow Jones Commodities News Select via Comtex) -- AIG   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating -- By Maya Jackson Randall Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRESThe global credit crunch proves the need for 'completely new' thinking when it comes to financial market regulations, said Jacob Frenkel, the vice chairman of troubled insurance giant American International Group Inc. (AIG).Speaking at a conference Saturday in Washington, Frenkel said financial regulations need to require greater market transparency and disclosure and much quicker responses to turmoil.'I think this is a good wake-up call what we have now,' he said, pointing out how 'systemically interconnected' the global economy is. 'We definitely need a holistic approach.'Still, he criticized the plan of action the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations issued Friday, saying it failed to include critical details about how and when officials will respond to the credit crisis.'Without a date, things are too amorphic,' Frenkel said. 'we need to be very precise.'He added that the crisis weighing on the global economy also makes clear the need for central banks 'to have the driver's seat' when it comes to bank supervision. He noted that in some countries, bank supervision is farmed out to certain financial stability groups.Frenkel didn't specifically mention AIG's recent troubles. In mid-September, U.S. federal regulators announced an unprecedented rescue of the insurer, signaling that unlike Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), which has filed for bankruptcy, AIG was too big for the government to allow to fail.As part of the $85 billion bailout, the U.S. government took a 79.9% stake in AIG, which is one of the world's biggest insurance companies. Earlier this week, the U.S. Federal Reserve said it agreed to make an additional $37.8 billion credit line available to the company.-By Maya Jackson-Randall, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9255; maya.jackson-randall@dowjones.com(Meena Thiruvengadam and Brian Blackstone contributed to this report.)Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=WgBlV0pZ%2FEOatpqR2kJxjg%3D%3D.
