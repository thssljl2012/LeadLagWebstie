Oct. 3, 2008 American International Group is putting its domestic life insurers up for sale with other assets, the company said today. The company will focus on its property and casualty business, said AIG CEO Edward M. Liddy. Liddy had previously said the company would be selling assets to help pay back its $85 billion loan, but AIG would retain its core companies. The announcement earlier this week that AIG would be selling its half-share of a London airport seemed to be in keeping with that. The company will be keeping its foreign life insurance interests, AIG said. This is even though it is the exposure to overseas markets, particularly Asia, that made the subsidiaries tempting targets, analysts have said. But still, subsidiaries such as American General have been called crown jewels for potential buyers. Or it could be one buyer, according to Liddy. Our strong intent would be to sell (the U.S. life and retirement) operations in toto, to one buyer, Liddy said in a teleconference today, according to National Underwriter. AIGs life companies are: --AGC Life Insurance Company; --AIG Annuity Insurance Company; --AIG Life Insurance Company; --AIG SunAmerica Life Assurance Company; --American General Life and Accident Insurance Company; --American General Life Insurance Company; --American International Assurance Company (Bermuda) Limited; --American International Life Assurance Company of New York; --American Life Insurance Company; --First SunAmerica Life Insurance Company; --SunAmerica Life Insurance Company; --The United States Life Insurance Company in the City of New York; --The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company.
