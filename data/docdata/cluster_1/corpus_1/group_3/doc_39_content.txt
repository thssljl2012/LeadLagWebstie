LAKE FOREST, Calif., Oct. 28, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apria Healthcare Group Inc.

After almost 11 years with Apria, Lawrence M. Higby has elected to retire from his position as Chief Executive Officer.

Payson, an Apria board member for the past two years and a former managed care executive, will serve as Executive Chairman and interim Chief Executive Officer. Dr. Payson commented, 'Larry Higby and his team have done an outstanding job in growing Apria from $940 million in revenues in 1999, as a provider of primarily home respiratory and medical equipment services, to $2.1 billion in revenues as a highly diversified and high quality provider of a broad range of homecare services. He and his team have grown Apria into the leading U.S. home healthcare company. In addition, Larry's personal leadership of numerous industry-wide initiatives has been critical to the Company's success.' 'Our alliance with Blackstone will enable Apria to continue to expand and enhance the homecare services we provide to millions of patients and thousands of customers each year,' said Mr. Higby. 'Blackstone brings an experienced group of long-term healthcare investors who are committed to reinforcing our company's mission of being our patients' and customers' first choice for homecare services in the United States. With the consummation of the merger, we look forward to continued growth and success as the nation's leading home healthcare company. On behalf of Apria's management and Board of Directors, I want to thank our stockholders and dedicated employees for their support through this process.' Blackstone Senior Managing Director Neil Simpkins said, 'We look forward to working with Apria team members to build on the Company's track record of delivering high quality medical care. We are fortunate to have Norm Payson taking a leadership role to ensure continuity and to accelerate our future growth plans for Apria. Dr. Payson brings a great deal of healthcare industry expertise as both a physician and experienced executive.' Dr. Payson added, 'With the help of our dedicated employees, I am looking forward to partnering with Blackstone to ensure the Company continues its commitment to high quality patient care and its growth trajectory.'
