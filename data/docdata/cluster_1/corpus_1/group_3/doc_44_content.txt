DUBLIN, Ireland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/0ee60c/mexico_insurance_r) has announced the addition of the 'Mexico Insurance Report Q3 2008' report to their offering.  Our Mexico Insurance Report provides independent forecasts and competitive intelligence on Mexico's insurance industry.In Q308, the key change is that we have incorporated much more information about the companies that are operating across the regions of which each country is a part. We have sought to make it much clearer who is operating in each country and under what name(s). Perhaps equally importantly, our profiles make it plain which multi-national companies are not operating in each country.In Latin America, we profile 21 companies. These are AEGON, AGF, AIG, Allianz, AXA, Cardif, CNP, Generali, HDI-Talanx, HSBC Insurance, ING, Liberty Mutual, MAPFRE, MetLife, New York Life, Prudential Financial, QBE, RSA, the Hartford, Principal Financial, and Zurich.We also look at various of the local firms that are active. In general, they are small-to-medium sized operations by world-standards. However, several of the leading Brazilian insurers would rank as extremely large even in a major market.For almost all the countries whose reports we are updating, we are also able to include actual data for calendar 2007: this was not the case for our Q208 reports.In 2007, total premiums in Mexico rose by 16% to MXN193, 606 million. Non-life premiums rose by 18% to MXN114, 228 million, while Life premiums rose by 14% to MXN79,378 million.Between now and the end of the forecast period, we expect that annual Non-life premiums will grow by MXN 33,611 million, while annual Life premiums should increase by MXN 82,820 million. Growth in Non-life premiums should be driven by the general growth in nominal GDP. However, we are looking for Non-life penetration to slip slightly from the current level of 1.18% of GDP to 1.10%. Growth in Life premiums should be driven by the change in the overall population and a rise in life density from US$66.84 to US$120.00 per capita. Our Insurance Business Environment Rating is 64.0.Key Topics Covered:
