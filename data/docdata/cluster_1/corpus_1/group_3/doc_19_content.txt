American International Group Inc. pumped 90.7 billion yen (618.6 million euros) into Alico Japan in a bid to reinforce its capital strength and to bolster financial health of the Japanese life insurer. Alico Japan, a life insurance subsidiary of AIG, required capital from its parent company amid a share plunge in the Tokyo stock market. The fall in share price of AIG, which is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, raised worries on Alico Japan's capital foundation. Alico Japan found it necessary to reinforce its capital base because it had to write off 130 billion yen for the April-June quarter in valuation losses on its holdings of AIG shares, according to Alico Japan. Alico Japan's capital now totals at 328.2 billion yen, according to the company. The newly-injected capital consists of 68.8 billion yen in cash and 21.9 billion yen in bonds issued by AIG.
