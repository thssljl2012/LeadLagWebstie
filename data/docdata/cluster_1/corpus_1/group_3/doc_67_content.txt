American International Underwriters, one of the largest general insurers in Hong Kong and Asia, said its Asian operations would not be sold or affected by the troubles of its United States parent, American International Group. AIG executive vice-president Nicholas Walsh yesterday rejected market speculation that it would consider selling the profitable Asian general insurance arm to repay a government loan. AIG earlier this month escaped collapse by accepting an US$85 billion US government bailout plan.
