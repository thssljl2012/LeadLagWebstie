When news broke that insurance giant AIG planned to dole out more than $165 million in bonuses to company executives, Public Citizen was outraged. We immediately got to work determining how to respond. We developed a plan - and we need you to take action today. Tomorrow, AIG CEO, Edward M. Liddy, will testify before a House subcommittee examining how AIG got into its current economic mess and why it needs so much taxpayer bailout money. We know you have thoughts and opinions about AIG&#8217;s behavior, and we want to hear them. E-mail us by 10 p.m. with the message you would like to send to Liddy.Public Citizen staffers will print out the messages and personally deliver them tomorrow to Liddy, Congress and members of the press. That&#8217;s right. This is your chance to tell Liddy and policymakers exactly what you think. We&#8217;re also going to post them on our Web site. We&#8217;ll publish your first name only (or let us know if you prefer us to keep your comment anonymous). It&#8217;s time to put an end to this era of irresponsible behavior and wasteful spending. The fact that companies like AIG are taking taxpayer money - YOUR money - while handing out millions of dollars in bonuses to people who oversaw the company&#8217;s downfall is an outrage. We need all the support we can muster to send a message that this is unacceptable. Please send us your comments today, and forward this e-mail to your friends and colleagues. Urge them to send a message to Liddy too. We must make our voices heard loud and clear tomorrow at the hearing. Posted in Activism, Congress Tagged: AIG, bailout, bonuses, economy, Edward M.
