Liberals always contend that dissent is patriotic. How ya like dissent now? The Tenth Amendment is not all that hard to understand: The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.  Nowhere among the enumerated powers is there authority for the federal government to be in the mortgage loan business  as in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Nowhere is there authority for the federal government to be in the banking, or insurance business  as in Citibank, and AIG. Nowhere is there authority for the federal government to be in the health care business, or the animal identification business, or in the energy business, or in most of the places where the federal government is now flexing its regulatory muscles. This should be clear enough, even for Harvard graduates, especially those who claim to be Constitutional scholars. The administration has, how shall we say, overreached. Now, more and more states are pushing back. Good.
