What gets me is that no one in the press core is asking JP Morgan, Citibank, or Bank of America, who are claiming that they are doing better this quarter than expected, is because they have received bailout funds.They are not doing any better!  They have bailout funds!  Their math doesn't equate, because they are including these funds in their calculations as to the public perception of doing better they are once again blindsiding the public into thinking things are getting better...People, Wake the fuck up!This is another means of manipulation of the markets for the benefit of the corporations.  Their accounting is off and no one cares or is calling it!This, the 264th entry in bloggoland!  Thanks for reading and coming back.  I always enjoy the comments, emails and the banter!!(c)Copyright 2009 Doug Boggs(c)Copyright 2008 Doug Boggs
