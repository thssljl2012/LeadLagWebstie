Raising Taxes Worst Strategy In Recession - Markets Crash On News. Obama&#039;s $3.6 trillion federal budget and its proposal to raise taxes is absurdly labeled as &#034;an end to an era of irresponsibility&#034; is being widely panned by investors. As White House Budget Director Peter Orszag said, &#034; We must change course&#034; the stock market dived to record lows battered by the promise of new taxes; higher deficits and a general sense of change for its own sake. Coupled with an added $30 billion bailout of AIG and what some see as an impending nationalization of banks - witnessed by the government&#039;s majority stake in Citibank. Critics point out that increasing taxes on the successful plus limiting their deduction for mortgages and even charitable deductions is not only risky social engineering but smacks of socialistic practice. Also drawing fire is his proposal to start taxing industries on their greenhouse gas pollution &#8212; a move sure to raise consumers&#039; electric rates and spark inflation. Limiting charitable deductions for those most capable of contributing has sent nonprofits howling for help. Americans contributed $306.39 billion in 2007, a 3.6% increase exceeding inflation by 1%. The annual Giving USA report for 2008 has not been released and there is speculation that while giving may not fall it will not keep pace with inflation. Traditionally 75% of all giving has come from individuals and another 7-8% in the form of bequest. Corporation and foundations account for the balance so a prohibitive tax policy will hurt. Since religion and religion institutions - like affiliated hospitals and schools - attract the lions share of all giving the Obama strategy is seen by many as a assault by secularists on the religious which tend to be conservative. Businesses are sounding the alarm klaxon too that tax increases on small businesses earning more than $250,000 a year would stunt a possible recovery and that the plan would double the national debt in eight years. Small businesses account for most of the job growth while the White House is focused on auto companies and big banks for bailouts while punishing small businesses is being sharply criticized as a blueprint that could extend the recession for years.
