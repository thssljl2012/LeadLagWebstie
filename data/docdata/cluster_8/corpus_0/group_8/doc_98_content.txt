     Of course I am talking about the politicians, bankers, lawyers, accountants and embezzlers running through the streets of Washington, D.C., pants on fire. &#0160;Problem is, their flaming ass torches everything it touches.&#0160;It has been a busy week. &#0160;The U.S. Hose passed a&#0160;mandatory&#0160;service bill, and if Americans stupidly comply with it, they will be subjugating their&#0160;inalienable&#0160;rights to the US government. &#0160;Thank you so much, Mr Constitutional Law Professor at 1600&#0160;Pennsylvania&#0160;Avenue and your right hand man, Chief Spy for the Mossad. &#0160;In other news, the&#0160;Senate has ruled that bloggers are not journalists and thus have no right to protect sources or act in any way in&#0160;the&#0160;official capacity of a&#0160;journalist, and the man who everyone thought would lead US troops out of Iraq is salivating over a trillion plus dollar "defense" budget. &#0160;While the military is only allocated $750 billion mas o menos, Homeland Security, the CIA, NSA, FBI, Secret Service, Customs,&#0160;Immigration&#0160;and the funding of state and&#0160;municipal&#0160;police forces make the real "defense" portion of&#0160;the&#0160;budget well over a trillion dollars. &#0160;Obama has also called for the expansion of US forces in&#0160;Afghanistan, as well as expanding Afghani troops to 400,000. &#0160;The US taxpayer funds pretty much the entire economy of&#0160;Afghanistan, and will, of course, fund the expansion of Afghani forces. &#0160;At present,&#0160;there&#0160;are 170,000 military and&#0160;police&#0160;forces. &#0160;&#0160;Not wanting an opportunity to waste money and soak&#0160;the&#0160;taxpayer for it, the Senate is muling over a carbon tax bill, despite the obvious need for carbon dioxide on&#0160;the&#0160;planet. &#0160;There isn't anything about pollutants in the bill, only CO2. &#0160;Congress is trying to make sure that organic farms and farmers markets are put out of&#0160;business&#0160;with the introduction of draconian legislation that grants Monsanto full rights to all agribusiness in the United States and probably your backyard garden and your pot plants, too, but in complicated legalese favored by those trying to obfuscate the&#0160;obvious. &#0160;Meanwhile, the Senate passed an $819 Billion bailout bill with hardly any fanfare. &#0160;And without any fanfare at all,&#0160;the&#0160;Senate passed a bill to seize more than 2 million acres in nine states as protected wilderness, from a &#0160;California mountain range to more than a thousand miles of rivers. &#0160;Far from this being a warm and fuzzy effort to&#0160;protect&#0160;the&#0160;environment and save&#0160;endangered&#0160;species, the real reason behind this land grab is to collateralize the loans from abroad. &#0160;Remember, when it all implodes, China, Russia, France, Saudi Arabia, Germany, England and a few others eminent domain over national lands and all have the right to mine, drill and&#0160;develop&#0160;these lands per the fine print. &#0160;Actually, they already do&#0160;control&#0160;some of these properties via multi-nationals.What else is new? &#0160;This just in...Deteriorating economic conditions will cause the federal deficit to soar past $1.8 trillion this year and leave the nation wallowing in a sea of red ink far deeper than the White House had previously estimated, congressional budget analysts said today.In a new report that provides the first independent analysis of President Obama's budget request, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted that the administration's agenda would generate deficits averaging nearly $1 trillion a year over the next decade -- $2.3 trillion more than the president predicted when he unveiled his spending plan just one month ago.That's such an obvious, "Duh,"&#0160;that&#0160;it isn't worth commenting. &#0160;What really blew my mind was a bit further down&#0160;the&#0160;page.The new report could complicate efforts to win congressional approval for Obama's $3.6 trillion budget request for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Democrats in the House and Senate are currently putting the finishing touches on their versions of Obama's spending plan, which calls for an expensive expansion of health coverage for the uninsured and new spending on education programs, as well as a first-time tax on greenhouse gas emissions.Yes, the $3.6 trillion figure is unfathomable. &#0160;I don't know why, but I honestly thought the budget was in&#0160;the&#0160;$2.5 trillion range. &#0160;I cannot believe how often I write the word trillion. &#0160;Now Alan Greenspan is indicating that banks may need &#0160;north of $750 billion in fresh capital to avoid&#0160;collapse. &#0160;The bank losses thus far are estimated to be $1.25 Trillion, but given the market to market accounting methods, it's probably so much worse - and this without the commercial real estate crash that is beginning right now.And speaking of real estate, well, let's just say&#0160;the&#0160;universe has a sense of irony.(Bloomberg) --Barbara Desoer, who runs the largest U.S. housing lender, can speak from experience about tumbling property prices: She couldnt sell her own home.Desoer, 56, put her 4,500-square-foot house in Charlotte, North Carolina, on the market Aug. 1 for $1.675 million. She had just been named head of&#0160;Bank of America Corp.s&#0160;real-estate unit, Countrywide Financial Corp., in Calabasas, California. The home, which she and her husband bought in 2000 for $1.15 million, sold in December for a price that wasnt made public. The buyer: Bank of America, according to a&#0160;proxy&#0160;the lender filed March 18. Now the house is for&#0160;sale&#0160;again, at $1.295 million, $380,000 less than the original asking price, according to listing agent Allen Tate Realtors.&#0160;Too bad Ms. Desoer isn't living in a cardboard box under&#0160;the&#0160;bridge,&#0160;where&#0160;she belongs.I am impatient for the event, whatever it is, that will take care of this once and for all. &#0160;The collapse of&#0160;the&#0160;Soviet Union wasn't violent. &#0160;Incidents, yes, but the real violence came from the mafias that sprung up after the collapse. &#0160;We have the ability to take control and make this a good thing, or panic and&#0160;allow&#0160;those with&#0160;nefarious&#0160;agendas to control you. &#0160;Stay strong of heart. &#0160;Buy Gold. &#0160;Buy organic heirloom seeds and plant a&#0160;garden. &#0160;Prepare your own food. &#0160;Live healthy. &#0160;Enough preaching.
