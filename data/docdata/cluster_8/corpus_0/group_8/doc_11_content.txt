Citibank is broke. BROKE. They are insolvent if you want to use the fancier term. They were one of the original beneficiaries of TARP funds and will likely need more. Let&#8217;s be clear we have already nationalized them by giving them federal dollars, but instead of wiping out of the shareholders and cleaning out management we continue to let the incompetent foxes watch the hen house&#8230;on our dime. This has got to stop. AIG, Bank of America, Citi and the rest of the insolvent bastards need to be taken over, cleaned out and sold back as smaller, leaner BANKING INSTITUTIONS&#8230;no investment banking or none of that other shit. In AIG&#8217;s case, insurance only. How much longer of this foolishness are we going to have to take&#8230;Don&#8217;t Stop Now   Related posts:Yes, Nationalize the Damn Banks AlreadyThe Gold Digger&#8217;s Manifesto: How to Get Broke OffThe Bank &#8220;Bailout&#8221; is Really a Bank Giveaway&#8230;So Now What?
