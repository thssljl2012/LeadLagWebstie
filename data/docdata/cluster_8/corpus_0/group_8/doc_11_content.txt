 I&#8217;m only over the past few days really coming to understand what&#8217;s been going on with AIG. But the long and short of it is that all this money we&#8217;re giving &#8220;to AIG&#8221; isn&#8217;t really going to AIG, it goes to AIG&#8217;s counterparties. These are mostly banks (many of them abroad) who bought insurance from AIG against the possibility of a global financial meltdown. It turns out that AIG can&#8217;t actually pay all the insurance claims. So were AIG to go down, all these firms who thought they were at least partially insured against catastrophe would find out that they&#8217;ve got nothing and they, in turn, would go under. Hence, the government is stepping in to, in effect, pay off AIG&#8217;s debts.  That seems reasonable enough. But the retrospective look at things is truly outrageous. The whole idea of the insurance industry is that if I buy insurance from you, you pay off the claims. Absent ability to pay claims, there&#8217;s no business there at all. It&#8217;s just fraud. Whether or not it meets the legal standard for fraud, I couldn&#8217;t say. But in ordinary language sense, it&#8217;s a fraudyou&#8217;re selling a service you have no capacity to deliver. And AIG executives made a bunch of money engaged in it. Felix Salmon says: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to learn that Hank Greenberg was still a billionaire, even as the policies his company wrote have cost the average American household some $1,600. It&#8217;s time for his wealth to be confiscated: it might be only a drop in the bucket compared to AIG&#8217;s total losses, but it would feel very right.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think it would just feel right, it would be right. Thus far, there&#8217;s been an extraordinary aversion to actually punishing any of the people responsible. It&#8217;s true that most of them are less rich than they once were, but they&#8217;re still far richer than most people. And it shouldn&#8217;t be that wrecking your company and wrecking the world economy is a good way to become richer than most people.
