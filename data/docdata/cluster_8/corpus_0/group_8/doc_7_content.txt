 Have we all had enough of the criminal enterprise known as AIG Insurance? AIG just lost another $61.7 billion in the fourth quarter, the biggest quarterly loss in U.S. corporate history. How much in bailout dough have they recieved now? Pretty close to a quarter trillion. It's well beyond time to cut the umbilical cord. They have a right to fail just like you or me. So what is Barack Obama's Democrat led government have planned?The results come as the U.S. government also Monday announced a restructuring of a bailout plan for the troubled insurer, extending $30 billion in additional aid to the company.How many bailouts now for AIG? It's somewhere in the neighborhood of 4 or 5. Let me repeat the definition of insanity for those of you that can't quite grasp it. Insanity: Repeating the same actions, expecting different results. Your Democrat led Federal Government hard at work! Barack Obama is right. It's time for change.
