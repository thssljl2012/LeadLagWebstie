It should not surprise that the Republicans have taken to negativity like Paris Hilton does to doing nothing of significance. With every week, they are using whatever language it takes to throwmore gasoline on Obama&#8217;s 7-alarm economic crisis. Richard Shelby, banking committee member,commented recently about banks: &#8220;Close them down, get them out of business. If they&#8217;re dead, they ought to be buried,&#8221; Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said Sunday on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;This Week.&#8221; &#8221;We bury the small banks; we&#8217;ve got to bury some big ones and send a strong message to the market. And I believe that people will start investing in banks.&#8221; The faltering giant Citibank  the government recently increased its stake in the New York bank to more than 30 percent  has always been &#8220;a problem child,&#8221; Shelby said. About the automotive industry: &#8220;Let them fail,&#8221; speaking of the Big Three. John McCain, you know, the man who wanted your vote in November on banks: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ve made the tough decisions. Some of these banks have to fail,&#8221; McCain said on &#8220;Fox News Sunday.&#8221;  McCain and banking analysis should scare the average person. Charles Keating ring any bells??? Shelby is interested in keeping Alabama&#8217;s foreignautomotive industry happy, quoting the analysis of Chris Haak from What is Richard Shelbys Problem?: &#8220;&#8230;Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, and Honda. Toyota also has an engine plant in Alabama. These three companies would not have come to Alabama to build their plants - with scores of suppliers in tow for each of them as well - without substantial incentives, whether those be infrastructure, tax, or other incentives. For example, the state of Alabama gave Hyundai approximately $253 million in incentives toward its $1 billion facility. Honda got $158 million from Alabama, and Mercedes-Benz received $253 million. Not quite the amounts that were talking about in the GM-Ford-Chrysler rescue plan, but Senator Shelbys home state does seem to favor using taxpayers money to help fairly successful companies. So, presumably Shelby is OK with giving money to companies that - lets face it - didnt need the money, but against giving it to companies that really do need it.&#8221; The new leader of the Republicans, Rush Limbaugh, also has &#8220;let Obama fail,&#8221; on his brain. Hmmm.  These leaders purport to have the country&#8217;s best interests at heart, but the language speaks volumes. Failure seems on their brains. They don&#8217;t want banks to succeed under the current plans - even though I have yet to hear them articulate a real solution to a mess they created, or at least, did not have much of a response to after letting Lehman Brothers fail. (How&#8217;d that work out: $700 Billion TARP plan that still is not enough&#8230;scary.) Failure of the automotive industry. The last remaining vestige of a manufacturing might in America failing. Going to bankruptcy with no guarantee that works. President Obama failing. America losing more time and getting further behind (or narrowing the gap) between us and whomever is our next great challenge. This is not the language of rational and caring folks, but ideological and pedantic trogs with a ball they are going to take home. Failure is NOT the option.
