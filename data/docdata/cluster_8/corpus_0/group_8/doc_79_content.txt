Since AIG is big in the news right now, with Obama claiming his faux outrage over the bonuses, and Chris Dodd saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t blame me!&#8221;  &#8220;I mean, do blame me!&#8221; (c&#8217;mon, don&#8217;t you KNOW Rahm Emanuel showed Chris just how they do it in Chicago to make him take the fall for this?), I thought I would share the following piece from Pajamas Media on an interesting twist: Contributions to Obama Campaign Track Bailout Money Barack Obamas lack of leadership in a down economy has now hit [1] crisis proportions, as his claimed inability to block millions of dollars in bonuses for executives of bailout recipient AIG has caused even his supporters to turn on him. But while the ire of Congress and the media focus are on the $165 million that AIG paid out in bonuses to their executives, the president is hoping you wont notice the $100 billion in taxpayer bailout dollars that AIG paid out to other banks, including $58 billion to foreign banks and [2] $36 billion given to French and German banks alone. The Obama administration is allowing AIG to bail out the rest of the world with your tax dollars.  So by all means, the president is happy to have you railing at evil but relatively small potatoes AIG executive bonuses, as it points your outrage away from his own far more costly executive abuses.  And of course, the re-distributor-in-chief hopes you wont notice where much of the rest of the AIG bailout cash is being spent. While $58 billion of your tax dollars  or more accurately, your childrens tax dollars  are being used to pay foreign banks, a substantial portion of that money  ($43.5 billion) is being used to pay American banks, including Goldman Sachs, Merill Lynch, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wachovia, Morgan Stanley, AIG International, and JP Morgan. The following recipients of President Obamas trickle-down-to-my-donors bailout plan rank among his top 20 contributors to his 2008 presidential election campaign, according to [3] Open Secrets: Goldman Sachs: $955,473 Citigroup: $653,468 JP Morgan Chase &#038; Co.: $646,058 Morgan Stanley: $485,823 Well, looky there!!  Don&#8217;t THOSE names look just a little familiar?!  Just WAIT: Three other banks that were significant contributors to Obama received money through AIG: Bank of America: $274,493 Wachovia: $214,151 AIG: $112,170 Lehman Brothers, which did not survive long enough to join the list of banks leaching off the work of the American taxpayer, also gave the Obama campaign [4] $276,088. Individuals identifying themselves as working for the banks above gave Barack Obamas presidential campaign $3,617,724. In other words, more than 3.6 million reasons for the president to help focus the medias glare on the relatively minuscule $165 million in AIG executive bonuses, and away from their $43.5 billion portion of $100 billion of taxpayer dollars the administration, by design or incompetence, filtered to other banks through AIG. In receiving $43.5 billion for their investment of just over $3.3 million, it looks like the banks that gambled on Wall Street certainly got their moneys worth out of their investment in Barack Obama. Your tax paying dollars at work, folks!  To help pay back Obama&#8217;s big-money contributors to buy him the highest office in the land.  Wheeee!!!! If you want to read more on the AIG issue, SusanUnPC also has a good piece on the recent AIG/Dodd stuff, &#8220;Listen To Your Aunt Susan.&#8221; There is also Larry Doyle&#8217;s, &#8220;AIG Contracts A Brain Freeze,&#8221; are just a couple of other articles at No Quarter on the AIG issue.
