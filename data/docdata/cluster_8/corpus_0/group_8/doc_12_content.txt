NASCAR driver Jeff Burton criticized Congress on Friday over employee bonuses paid by troubled insurance giant AIG. "I think that Congress screwed it up, and it sure would be nice to have somebody stand up and say 'You know what? I screwed up and supported sending tax dollars to a company to bail them out and didn't put more stipulations in there,"' Burton said.
