The water served at the latest Group of 20  G-20  meeting of finance ministers and central bankers last weekend must have contained copious quantities of lead or have been shipped over from Stalinist Russia using a time machine. For nothing else apparently explains this newfound angst among the finance officers of this group - and in particular those from the developed countries - to cut off their noses to spite their political masters. Cynical people wholly unlike myself may say that this august gathering somehow figured out the futility of their actions and instead of admitting defeat decided to engage in diversionary tactics such as egging on non-scandals. Be it what it may  all         that chest-beating is of little consequence in terms of paving the way for a resolution of the key issues confronting the global financial markets. As a recap for readers unaware of the brouhaha  the US media have been increasingly shrill in recent days about the &#8220;billions&#8221; of dollars in bonuses paid in firms rescued with taxpayers  money. These range from AIG  which was rescued with US Treasury funds from the middle of September to the present all the way to Merrill Lynch  bought by Bank of America  which in turn received government funds in December to replenish the capital lost in the purchase . Interestingly  the initial scandal was brought about by the Bank of America-Merrill Lynch merger  which had been hastily arranged by US authorities in mid-September as investment banks teetered on the edge; Lehman Brothers did go bankrupt in that period. Since then  a series of management challenges within the newly merged entity may have created substantially enough bad blood to cause the lid to be blown off the events leading to a Merrill Lynch decision to pay US$3.6 billion to its employees just a working day or two before the merger was officially consummated on January 1  2009.
