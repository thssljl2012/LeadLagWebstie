Matthew Yglesias comments on the AIG debacle: The whole idea of the insurance industry is that if I buy insurance from you, you pay off the claims. Absent ability to pay claims, theres no business there at all. Its just fraud. Whether or not it meets the legal standard for fraud, I couldnt say. But in ordinary language sense, its a fraudyoure selling a service you have no capacity to deliver. And AIG executives made a bunch of money engaged in it.
