         Honestly, I had decided not to post yet another diatribe on the travails of disgraced (former) insurance giant AIG. After all, there's an ethical Rubicon that I feared to cross, given that we'd beaten up on the carrier so often of late.This morning brought news that they were back at the trough, demanding that we taxpayers fork over another $30 Billion.But that was then, this is now:"In the midst of its negotiation with the federal government over revised terms of its bailout, American International Group Inc. sued the U.S. on Friday over a disputed $306 million in taxes, interest and penalties."And guess who pays for that bit of litigation?Thee and me.Please remind me again why we threw them a safety net?
