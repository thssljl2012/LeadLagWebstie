There are a couple of things that concern me about this article.   It talks about what&#8217;s happening with Fannie and Freddie and how they&#8217;ve been nationalized.   Here are my concerns:  As Fannie and Freddie spend longer and longer under government control, I expect that we&#8217;re going to see more efforts by the government to use Fannie and Freddie to promote social agendas.  Agendas like, &#8220;We need to encourage home ownership because everyone should own a home.&#8221;   Yeah, how well did that work? If the government takes over Fannie and Freddie and isn&#8217;t going to let them &#8220;go private&#8221; again, what&#8217;s going to happen if they have to formalize the money pit efforts that they&#8217;ve already put into places like Citibank and Bank of America?  If we don&#8217;t do it right, we&#8217;re heading into a time in the financial markets where the results are going to be substantially different than what we would expect.   We need to be careful, very careful.Tom Vanderwell Fannie and Freddie Likely to Stay in U.S. Hands - NYTimes.com Despite assurances that the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be temporary, the giant mortgage companies will most likely never fully return to private hands, lawmakers and company executives are beginning to quietly acknowledge. The possibility that these companies  which together touch over half of all mortgages in the United States  could remain under tight government control is shaping the broader debate over the future of the financial industry. The worry is that if the government cannot or will not extricate itself from Fannie and Freddie, it will face similar problems should it eventually nationalize some large banks.
