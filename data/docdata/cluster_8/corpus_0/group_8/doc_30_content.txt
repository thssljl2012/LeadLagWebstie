[quote Lauren '06]No, the Canadian dollar is worth less than 78 cents on the American dollar (down from 90 cents in August 2008).  The American dollar has weakened, yes, but the Canadian has gone even worse.  I make out nice because I pay my Canadian rent and tuition from money stored in a US bank.  Those going the other way, not so much.  The only advantage to a weakening Canadian dollar is that they might qualify for more aid.[/quote]  Gotcha, it's a matter of time frame.  I was still back in [url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/images/prb0326_1-e.gif]2004[/url].
