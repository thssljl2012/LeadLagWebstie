very interesting critters.  Some have common sense, some well don&#8217;t have any.  Some make decisions based on their own true preferences without thinking what other individuals feel.  We&#8217;re all guilty of that, some more than others.  Some are just innately selfish and are compulsive liars.  Some are kind and generous and extremely thoughtful.  Well of course we&#8217;re an amalgamation of the good and bad. As humans, whether we would like to admit it or not, we look out for ourselves.  Sometimes we&#8217;re too selfish.  Look at AIG and look at CitiBank with their special bonuses&#8230;  A capitalist, selfish persona that has marred our economy on the basis of continuous greed.  What about the individuals that lost their jobs and homes because of that&#8230;   Look at the individuals in our lives.  Like the ones that steals our ideas, or the ones that borrow our money/clothes and etc and lie continuously that they do not have anything.  Or the ones that steals our significant other right under our noses.  But we also have those individuals that are not as conniving and evil as the others.   People are unbelievable creatures.  But they are also capable of kindness, selflessness and more.  Sometimes I find it hard to see, but am very grateful of the individuals that I see. I am deeply grateful of my letting go of individuals that were detrimental.  Life is 100 times better without them in it.   szmdlvph
