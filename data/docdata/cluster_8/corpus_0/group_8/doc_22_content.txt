Well folks where is the bailout money going? I want to know. We the taxpayers have poured around $200 billion dollars into AIG alone and AIG still lost $60 billion dollars in this quarter.You tell me! Where is all of that money?President Obama you said we would have clear access to what happens to our money. Well where is it? What is AIG doing with all of that money, I really want to know and believe me when I say, so do the rest of the American taxpayers.I heard somewhere that since AIG is an insurance company and they have been insuring those so called Mortgage Investment Portfolio's(MIP), is this where the money going?Are the people that invested in all of those MIP'S getting there investment back from the insurance company? Then along with that we are also buying up the bad mortgages from Fannie May and Fannie Mac, along with all of the other banks? Isn't this double paying,(as in double dipping?).I think there needs to be an investigation done by people that are not in any way associated with the banking, financial, or insurance business with the authority to find out where the money is going.Somebody out there is getting rich off of the taxpayer's money and I want to know who. It sure as hell isn't the middle class people who invested their money in stocks, bonds, MIP'S and other financial instruments to retire on.Once again where is it.People, I would love to hear from any or all of you about your thoughts on what I have written.really, really, disgusted,the gahillbilly
