The ratio of delinquent loans in Orange County hit 5.3 percent at the end of last year, topping the nationwide rate for the third straight quarter, reports TransUnion. The national rate was 4.6 percent and California&#8217;s was 6.9 percent. All three rates for loans 60 days or more past due increased from the third quarter and from a year ago. In fact, Orange County&#8217;s rate has increased for the past 10 quarters from 0.5 percent in June 2006. (Click on chart for larger image.) TransUnion has adjusted, for the worse, its forecast. Keith Carson, a senior consultant, says in a release the national rate could hit 8 percent or more by year end. Economic factors will continue to have a significant impact on the credit markets as unemployment increases and housing prices continue to erode,&#8221; Carson said. &#8220;However, if government efforts to reduce mortgage rates are successful, there could be a gradual increase in home purchases, moving toward a stabilization of housing prices and a decrease in mortgage loan delinquencies in 2010. Note he does not say prices will increase in 2010, only &#8220;stabilize&#8221; and that is if rates are successfully lowered by government intervention. This is a dismal release, in my opinion. One other interesting nugget about Orange County: the average mortgage debt per borrower slid a few grand to $405,451 at the end of 2008. It is now down 4.5 percent from the peak in September 2007.
