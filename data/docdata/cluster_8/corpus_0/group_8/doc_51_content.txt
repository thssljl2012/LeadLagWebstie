As I wrote last week, charities are up in arms over President Obamas proposal to trim the deductions that the rich take on charitable donations. Some alarmists say charity as we know it will be dead. Associated Press Former South African President Nelson Mandela, left,  speaks as  Bill Gates listens at an HIV/AIDS youth forum at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.  The reality may be less alarming. A philanthropy study out today from Bank of America shows that the majority of today&#8217;s wealthy and affluent donors wouldn&#8217;t stop their giving even if deductions were wiped out entirely. (BofA and the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University polled 700 households with net worths of at least $1 million and incomes of $200,000, which now counts as &#8220;Obama rich.&#8221;) According to the survey, 51.7% of wealthy donors said their giving would remain the same if they received zero income-tax deductions. Granted, 47% said they would give less if deductions were wiped out. Of that group, about a third said their giving would &#8220;somewhat decrease, while 10% predicted their gifts would &#8220;dramatically decrease.&#8221; So only 10% of the rich would cut off their contributions&#8211;and that is only if deductions went to zero. President Obama is proposing to reduce the deduction for top-income households to 28% from 35%. Still, there is troubling news. Those households earning $5 million or more gave less in 2007 than in 2005. And the economy in 2007 was in a lot better shape than it is now. Patrick Rooney, interim executive director of Indiana Universitys Center on Philanthropy, told the Chronicle  of Philanthropy that the economic downturn may have hit the very wealthiest donors before other Americans.  &#8220;In 2007, the economy hadnt collapsed the way it has now, but we were beginning to see some fraying around the edges,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That may have had a bigger impact on some of the high-net-worth households in a bigger way, and sooner, than it did on the overall economy.&#8221; If the wealthy were feeling less charitable in 2007 because of the economy, imagine how they are feeling now. So when charity takes a tumble this year&#8211;and it will&#8211;the economy, not Obama, will be the culprit.
