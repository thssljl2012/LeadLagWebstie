Belly up to the bottomless trough, you fucking pigs.  I kid you not, AIG is back asking the government for more money. Again. For the fourth freaking time. $30 billion this time. I think this brings the total to $305 billion. A third of a trillion dollars, and they will likely be asking for more in the near future.  As if this weren't bad enough, AIG has the freaking BALLS to SUE THE GOVERNMENT! Yeah, it's not enough that they are inhaling dollars faster than the federal government can shovel them out (AIG still managed to post a $60B loss last quarter), but they are actually suing the very people who are bailing them out! It would be comedic if it wasn't so tragic.  Oh, and the best part? According to the first article:  "To further reduce its debt, AIG will turn $5 billion to $10 billion worth of debt into new securities backed by life insurance assets."  Read that again. To reduce their debt even further, they are using their own customers' life insurance as collateral. Guess what happens to those policies when AIG is forced into bankruptcy?  *poof*  Eat your fill, pig-men.Your customersneed you fattened up for the summer roasts!
