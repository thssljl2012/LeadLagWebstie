Not only have the upper classes managed to divert much of the United Snakes Treasury into their pockets, to cover their losses, but the financial crisis they caused has had a few other benefits for them."That's what it feels like we're returning to. Work as many hours as you possibly can. Make yourself indispensable. Don't ever complain. Don't ever ask for anything," she said. "I'm just horrified we may as well just forget the last 20 years."For their part, many managers are doing little to calm those concerns, human resource consultants say. They tend to view options such as flex time and telecommuting as retention tools, experts say, and in recessions, fear of unemployment is just as effective.Ah, "retention tools." Like the bonuses given to former AIG employees who'd already left the insurance giant. In other words, they don't one shit about you, or your mental &amp; physical health. They think they have the upper hand now, &amp; can continue the war on people who work for a living."I have heard comments like, 'now is our chance to take back the company,' [and] comments about the fact employees shouldn't feel entitled to ask for flexibility during this time because they should be lucky to have a job," she said.Is Americans were anything like the mythical ancestors the right claims for them, they would have (literally) "tea-bagged" their exploiters yrs. ago, &amp; taken back the companies that the workers (it's never the bosses) have made successful. But they're scared little sheep, who were too stupid &amp; ignorant to understand their situation, or do anything about it.Little or nothing good is going to come of any of this. Little or nothing good for the vast majority of Americans or other working people world-wide. Certain groups will be able to profit from this, as they always have. Plug for The Shock Doctrine here.
