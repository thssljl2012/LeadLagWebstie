In the news at the moment is AIG, the US insurance "giant". They`ve been busy everywhere, spreading their capital everywhere, including the greasy, sticky hands of Obamsteen. One of their core business involvements is within the Israeli mortgage market, through a subsidary called......Ezer Mortgage Insurance.(Thanks to the author at Blogocrity for that one, and reading the comments makes for some interesting moments.)Of course, in Israel, being a "special nation", of "special people", they have slightly different values.One being the price of property, which by any measure seems to be highly over-valued, ten times more expensive than Egypt or Palestine, and the other little benefit, as can be seen from the link, is a special clause that allows the Israelis to take periods of "grace" on their repayments.Imagine that some of those mortgages may be of dubious certification or provenance,....far be it for me to cast aspersions or slurs upon the Jewish people, but lately, the rise of names such as Madoff, Geithner, Bernanke, are not exactly inspiring confidence in the business practices of the chosen race.Enough, genug jetzt, don`t just take my word, check out a voice of reality and sanity, and let`s not take life too seriously.                     "Flabbergasted?"   (Alternative, possibly  slightly unkosher comedy:)
