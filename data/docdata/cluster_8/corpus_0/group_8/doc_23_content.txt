Bad profits and politics in a MultiCultClassics Monologue Insurance behemoth AIG reported 4Q losses at $61.7 billion, the largest loss in U.S. corporate history. Whats the prize for such an honor? More federal bailout loot. Wendys/Arbys reported 4Q losses at $393.2 million. Thats waaaaay better than AIG. A local New York chapter of the NAACP is fired up over a Staten Island Community Education Council appointee who forwarded a racist email. The email featured images from the last presidential debate between Barack Obama and John McCain, with word balloons depicting a discussion filled with racist jokes. It was a political cartoon, said the appointee. It was a joke, and I treated it as such. Actually, this guys a racist joke.
