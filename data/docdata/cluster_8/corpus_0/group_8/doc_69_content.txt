New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo reveals heretofore unknown details about the AIG bonuses, such as:  The top recipient received more than $6.4m; The top seven bonus recipients received more than $4m each;  The top ten bonus recipients received a combined $42m;  22 individuals received bonuses of $2m or more, and combined they received more than $72m;  73 individuals received bonuses of $1m or more; and  Eleven of the individuals who received "retention" bonuses of $1m or more are no longer working at AIG, including one who received $4.6m.And so on.  Can someone explain to me why the New York state attorney general is telling us this, and not the US department of the treasury? I know Andrew Cuomo. He's a tough SOB. He'll go get the bastards. And Geithner? I started to wonder today if this guy is on thin ice. Then I saw that Robert Gibbs, in his briefing today, said the White House has "complete confidence" in Geithner, a famous kiss-of-death phrase in American politics. First he orchestrated that bumbling press conference, and then he caved in to AIG on the bonuses. I don't know how many strikes you get in cricket. In Amurkan baseball, ya gets three.AIGUS Government borrowingTimothy GeithnerInsurance industryUS economic growth and recessionGlobal recessionUS economyUnited Statesguardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009   Use of this content is subject to our Terms &amp; Conditions   More Feeds
