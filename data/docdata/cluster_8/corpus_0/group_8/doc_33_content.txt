      NOT the crap Hannity, Limbaugh and Joe the Plumber are peddling.  (h/t Matt Yglesias)Market Moversby Felix SalmonMar 2 2009   1:23PM  ESTThe AIG Scandal...the scandal is that AIG could have earned billions of dollars by selling insurance against a meltdown, even as it was wholly incapable of paying out on those policies. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Hank Greenberg was still a billionaire, even as the policies his company wrote have cost the average American household some $1,600. It's time for his wealth to be confiscated: it might be only a drop in the bucket compared to AIG's total losses, but it would feel very right.We should also go after some of the MOTU who made a LOT of money creating the Big Shitpile.
