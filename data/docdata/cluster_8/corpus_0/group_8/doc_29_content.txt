Remember the $20 million in taxpayer money Gov. Rick Perry gave to Countrywide Financial to create 7,500 jobs? The troubled subprime lender has become synonymous with the reckless Wall Street buccaneers that made billions in bad loans that triggered the financial crisis. Back in 2004, Perry called the taxpayer infusion in Countrywide the "crowning jewel" in his Texas Enterprise Fund. The governor's office says it still hopes Countrywide (which has been swallowed up by Bank of America) will make good on the job creation promised by Perry.  Now comes a fascinating story in the New York Times about how some ex-Countrywide executives are now profiting from the kind of bad loans they used to make.   Stanford L. Kurland, Countrywide's former president, and his team have been buying up delinquent home mortgages that the government took over from other failed banks, sometimes for pennies on the dollar. They get a piece of what they can collect.   Margot Saunders of the National Consumer Law Center puts it all in context: "It is sort of like the arsonist who sets fire to the house and then buys up the charred remains and resells it."
