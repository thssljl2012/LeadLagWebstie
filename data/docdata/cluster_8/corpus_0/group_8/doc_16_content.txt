From Chicago Business: Pension bombs going offExploding pension fund shortfalls are blowing billion-dollar holes in the balance sheets of some of the Chicago area's biggest companies, forcing them to make huge contributions to retirement plans at a time when cash flow and credit are already under stress.Boeing Co.'s shareholder equity is now $1.2 billion in the hole thanks to an $8.4-billion gap between its pension assets and the projected cost of its obligations for 2008. At the end of 2007, Boeing had a $4.7-billion pension surplus. If its investments don't turn around, the Chicago-based aerospace giant will have to quadruple annual contributions to its plan to about $2 billion by 2011.Stock market losses also pounded pension funds at Abbott Laboratories Inc., Caterpillar Inc. and Exelon Corp., with others sure to emerge as companies file their annual financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission in coming weeks.More ponzi finance in action.If you consider social security to be a ponzi scheme, and most of you probably do, then what exactly is a 401k or a pension fund? They suffer the same limitations as social security in that once money is withdrawn from baby boomer retirements, there more than likely isn't enough people still in those systems to keep the values of them up and keep them functioning.The choices for many companies, sooner or later, will be to dump their pension plans or go out of business. Of course, PBGC will get some stress from this activity.An interesting thing about the PBGC from their website: www.pbcg.govPBGC is a federal corporation created by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. It currently protects the pensions of nearly 44 million American workers and retirees in more than 29,000 private single-employer and multiemployer defined benefit pension plans. PBGC receives no funds from general tax revenues. Operations are financed by insurance premiums set by Congress and paid by sponsors of defined benefit plans, investment income, assets from pension plans trusteed by PBGC, and recoveries from the companies formerly responsible for the plans. I'm sure the PBGC has been JUST AS IRRESPONSIBLE with investing the insurance premiums as say the likes of AIG and the other insurance companies, and AMBAC, MBIA, etc, ad nauseum, have been with investing their premiums.I'm sure there will be a government bailout in the future for this. Oh, but that just makes it social security, doesn't it? The safe bets on ALL of these retirement plans... Are to assume that they are ALL zeros.
