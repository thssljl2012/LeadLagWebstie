I don&#8217;t know what is worse, that American International Group (AIG), the giant and broke insurance company, is about to reportedly announce the largest quarterly corporate loss in U.S. (and probably world history) or that taxpayers will now cough up still more money in an effort to keep it from dying. According to a Reutersreport, and others, the U.S government is giving AIG another $30 billion bailout&#8211;the third time &#8220;we the people&#8221; have stepped in to help save &#8220;them the thieves!&#8221; Why? Because despite all the money already flushed down AIG&#8217;s enormous toilet, the company is apparently going to report a fourth quarter loss of about $60 billion. Or, as Reuters calculated, $460,000 per minute!!!!!!! By now, you know the excuse&#8212;AIG is TOO FREAKING BIG TO FAIL!!!!! Oh, and for those who are in a panic about the prospect that the government will probably eventually have to nationalize at least some of the major banks for a short amount of time, guess what? AIG is already nationalized! For More Commentary, Please Visit www.notimetothinkbook.com, The Official Website For THE Media Book Of 2009, No Time To Think
