Ken Lewis, Bank of America CEO, continues his public relations campaign to convince people/investors that BofA is not insolvent.  He is now claiming that it was a tactical mistake for BofA to take TARP money to purchase Merrill Lynch.  What a crock!   The only reason why this guy still has a job is because no one else wants to command a sinking ship.   Could we have our money back?  Lewis, says yes, but probably in two to three years.  Does anyone believe this b.s. anymore?  He is probably better off just shutting up because intentionally misleading with public statements should get you in trouble with the SEC (assuming they are still in enforcing securities laws).
