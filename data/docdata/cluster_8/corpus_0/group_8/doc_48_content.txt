       Yesterday's news report on the insurance giant AIG really pissed me off.&#0160; I know I'm not alone in feeling this way as Twitter, Facebook and the blogs are all showing the emotions of others who are steamed at the thought of a bailed-out bank doling out $165 million dollars in bonuses.&#0160; On my Facebook profile this morning, I posted how I felt: "AIG executives need to step forward and decline those bonuses.&#0160; It's the right thing to do." Within a short time, there were several who responded and shared their outrage as well.  "They have the nerve to ask for a bail out;then turn around and still give bonuses??"&#0160;  "And they say that it is in their contract to receive those big bonuses. But as far as I am concerned, the contracts should be voided when you are using taxpayer's money." According to the Huffington Post, the top 50 executives will receive the bonuses averaging about $112,000 each.&#0160; AIG's lawyers insist that that the bonuses have to be paid out as part of their 2008 contracts or the company would face lawsuits.&#0160; Seven of the top 50 executives have agreed not to accept the bonus money.  Only seven?
