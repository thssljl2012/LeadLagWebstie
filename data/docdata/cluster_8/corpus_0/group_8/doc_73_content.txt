By Robert CreamerWhen reports spread that insurance giant AIG would give top executives huge bonuses after a $170 billion taxpayer bailout, you could feel the anger rumbling in Middle America like boiling magna before the eruption of a volcano.Many top officials of the Obama administration were beside themselves with outrage.And just imagine how protestations from AIG's CEO about its "contractual obligations" sounded to UAW workers who are being asked once again to modify their contractual agreements to keep the auto industry in business. But the titans of the financial sector seem to have very different standards for themselves and the rest of the American economy.Recall that these bonuses are going to executives at AIG's financial products division  the very unit that wrote trillions of dollars of "creditdefaultswaps" that insured investors against defaults on bonds backed by subprime mortgages. The problem was that AIG used a loophole in the law to argue that the "creditdefaultswaps" were not really insurance, so they weren't required to abide by insurance laws which would have assured that they had the capital on hand to pay claims when defaults actually occurred. That caused AIG to collapse and helped precipitate the global financial crisis. Seven of these executives get from $3 to $6.5 million. So much for responsibility.
