A lot of Republicans filling this slot lately&#8230; I suggest, you know, obviously, maybe they ought to be removed. But I would suggest the first thing that would make me feel a little bit better toward them if they&#039;d follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say, I&#039;m sorry, and then either do one of two things: resign or go commit suicide. And in the case of the Japanese, they usually commit suicide before they make any apology.  Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, suggesting how AIG executives should accept responsibility for the collapse of the insurance giant Senator Grassley, Japanese politicians who violate the public trust also commit suicide. Where&#039;s your place in line?
