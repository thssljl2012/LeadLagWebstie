In Business, Simplicity Is Golden   Paul Johnson Complexity conceals bad judgment, incompetence, unconscionable risk-taking and sheer dishonesty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               More From Paul Johnson                                                                                                                                                                                      The lesson we must learn from the 2008--09 crisis is the vital importance in business, not least in banking, of simplicity. Next to honesty it is the most important virtue, and the two are usually connected. Unfortunately, many people--whose brains and ingenuity are not matched by judgment--have a passion for complexity, and electronic technology makes it easy for them to indulge that passion. The clouds of almost impenetrable complexity they create conceal bad judgment, incompetence, unconscionable risk-taking and sheer dishonesty. For instance, a mortgage, a form of borrowing that goes back to the 12th century, ought to be simple. You buy a house and pay for part of it by borrowing money from a professional mortgage lender against the security of the property. You pay interest on the loan and a portion of the capital annually. There are only two parties to the transaction--you and the mortgage provider, who assesses your creditworthiness and sets the terms of the deal. Dangerous Mix Technology has made it easy to complicate such deals to an almost infinite extent. The undisclosed object is to enable people who can't really afford to buy a house to acquire one. The net result is twofold: a violent inflation in property prices, which is visible; and a huge increase in the total volume of debt, which is often concealed.Worse, instead of the transaction being a clear business between two parties, it has become an impenetrable one between dozens, even hundreds, especially banks. This increases the cost, and thus the debt, by allowing a lot of parties to get a slice of the profits. It is an incitement to greed and, since the original borrower is often uncreditworthy, a sure road to disaster. The subprime crisis is a classic example of what happens when pristine simplicity is transformed into needless complexity by the driving force of greed abetted by technology.Banking also ought to be a simple business. You deposit money in a bank, which keeps it safe and pays you interest. The bank lends the money of depositors to borrowers, who use it as working capital to build up their businesses, in return paying the bank interest plus (by an agreed upon time) the principal. The difference between the two rates of interest allows the bank to pay its staff and to give its investors a return at a reasonable profit.Human ingenuity and the love of making simple matters difficult--an important part of the human psyche--have always tended to make banking more complicated than it ought to be. This has been true since the Order of the Knights Templar, whose original role had been to guard the treasure of the Crusaders, spread throughout the Holy Land and Europe, and set up a banking network. All their successors--from the Florentine and Lombardian bankers to the Jewish bankers of Frankfurt to the bankers of the City of London and Wall Street--have tended to add new complexities.To a degree, such refinements are useful, for they increase the extent and flexibility of credit, which in turn expands the wealth of the world and, subsequently, the comfort and security of people. But complexity ceases to be desirable once it prevents reasonably intelligent inquirers from understanding it. A bank and its operations ought to be transparent. In recent years this has ceased to be the case. Technology has made it possible for banks to do things totally beyond the capacity of inky clerks sitting on high stools and writing entries in ledgers with quill pens.This is progress, of course, but it has brought increased risks: Immensely complicated transactions involving vast sums of money take place in seconds, all over the world. Thus a young man, sitting in front of a cluster of computer screens, was able to put at risk the entire financial resources of Barings Bank, an institution that had been built up over two centuries. This would not have been possible had he still been a clerk in charge of a ledger.The complexities introduced into banking in recent years have produced such a fog of ignorance that what was once the world's largest bank, Citibank, became impenetrable, not only to outsiders but also to the officials nominally in charge of it. They simply didn't know the full extent of the debt acquired--not to mention what proportion of it was bad debt and irrecoverable. Axioms for the Future I have always been highly suspicious of things that ought to be simple but have become too intricate for me to grasp. And I am doubly suspicious of those who make them so. I once conducted a TV interview with Robert Maxwell, head of a large publishing empire. I asked him why the structure of his holding company was so complicated and why all its filaments seemed to end up in inaccessible bank accounts in Luxembourg. His explanations clouded the situation even more, and he got very angry when I pressed him. I did not then know that he was already raiding the assets of his firm's pension fund to keep the precarious structure from collapsing. But I knew for a certainty there was something fundamentally wrong.Here are some pointers: Trust what is simple and can be understood at a glance. Anything more elaborate, investigate carefully and thoroughly; if it's too convoluted for you to grasp, pull back. Remember, in financial matters the object of complexity is all too often to conceal the truth, to deceive.All this is obvious. Odd that we should have to reiterate it. Meanwhile, the wealth of the world has been halved.
