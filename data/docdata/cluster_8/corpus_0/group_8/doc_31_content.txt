 Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., right, dances and jokes with Russert, left, as they watch Dodd&#8217;s younger daughter Christina, 2, second from right, dance after a taping of &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; Oct. 28, 2007, in Washington, when Dodd was running for president. Dodd&#8217;s wife, Jackie Clegg, and older daughter Grace, 6, are shown in the middle This revelation certainly will NOT help Senator Chris Dodd, U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman in the polls back home in Connecticut as his re-election campaign begins.  No wonder Senator Christopher Dodd (D-Conn) went wobbly last week when asked about his February amendment ratifying hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses to executives at insurance giant AIG. Dodd has been one of the company&#8217;s favorite recipients of campaign contributions. But it turns out that Senator Dodd&#8217;s wife has also benefited from past connections to AIG as well.  From 2001-2004, Jackie Clegg Dodd served as an &#8220;outside&#8221; director of IPC Holdings, Ltd., a Bermuda-based company controlled by AIG. IPC, which provides property casualty catastrophe insurance coverage, was formed in 1993 and currently has a market cap of $1.4 billion and trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol IPCR. In 2001, in addition to a public offering of 15 million shares of stock that raised $380 million, IPC raised more than $109 million through a simultaneous private placement sale of 5.6 million shares of stock to AIG - giving AIG a 20% stake in IPC. (AIG sold its 13.397 million shares in IPC in August, 2006.) Clegg was compensated for her duties to the company, which was managed by a subsidiary of AIG.  In 2003, according to a proxy statement, Clegg received $12,000 per year and an additional $1,000 for each Directors&#8217; and committee meeting she attended. Clegg served on the Audit and Investment committees during her final year on the board.  IPC paid millions each year to other AIG-related companies for administrative and other services. Clegg was a diligent director. In 2003, the proxy statement report, she attended more than 75% of board and committee meetings. This while she served as the managing partner of Clegg International Consultants, LLC, which she created in 2001, the year she joined the board of IPC. (See Dodd&#8217;s public financial disclosure reports with the Senate from 2001-2004 here.)  But, look at this chart of her further business dealings as the wife of a powerful United States Senator.   There will be lots of &#8216;plaining to do by the Senator and his wife regarding their personal and professional relationships with numerous concerns, including the failed AIG, doing business with the federal government. And, Senator Dodd thought that his Countrywide Financial political loan scandal was his ONLY problem.
