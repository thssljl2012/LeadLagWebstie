Today the US governmint is shelling out another $30 billion of our hard-earned moola to insurance giant AIG. Seems the earlier $60 billion loan (on top of another $40B buyout of share AND $50B spent absorbing AIG's "toxic assets") hasn't been enough to keep them from stumbling  this morning they're posting $60B in losses in the last quarter. Gee, do you think the company's dead in the water? After all, that's the kind of bloat consistent with a body that's been in the river for a while. You'd think AIG would have been shrewd enough to take out a policy against this kind of tragedy...
