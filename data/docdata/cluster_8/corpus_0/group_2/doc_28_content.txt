How many times have you felt that you were cheated by some large company? Last month, I bought this TV stand from a well known company. Just when I brought it home, I realised that there was a major design flaw, and that if even a child would lean on it, then it may topple over. I went back to the company showroom with its bill, but in spite of many request the manager did not even bother to talk to me. So, what do you?I searched in Google and came up with  Ripoff Report . (Fortunately for me, the company later gave me a full refund, so I did not bother to follow the case up) Ripoff repot allows you to hold your ground and talk to the large companies in equal terms. After you file a report the company cannot choose to ignore you since their very reputation is at stake. They can inturn file a rebuttal and thus save their skin. Popular names in the rip off list includes Bank of America, Wallmart and Pizza Hut.http://adsforblog.blogspot.com
