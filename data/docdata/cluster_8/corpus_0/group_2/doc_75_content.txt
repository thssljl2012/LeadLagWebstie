While the rants about amateurish bloggers and know nothing blogosphere by the mainstream media will continue unabated, this is another reason they should stop and take another look in the mirror: In December, Fortune magazine admitted it had been remiss naming insurance giant AIG one of its &amp;#8220;10 Stocks To Buy Now&amp;#8221; before a yearlong 18 percent decline. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8230; didn&amp;#8217;t expect [the] mortgage unit to be such an albatross,&amp;#8221; editors wrote. To correct the error, the magazine had a fresh list of &amp;#8220;The Best Stocks For 2008&amp;#8243;  including Merrill Lynch. &amp;#8220;Smart investors should buy this stock before everyone else comes to their senses,&amp;#8221; Fortune wrote, calling a recent correction in Merrill stock &amp;#8220;an overreaction. Meanwhile, Calculated Risk and The Big Picture (among many other fine examples) were waaaaay ahead on what ails the economy and what might happen. I am sure CNBC, Fortune, BusinessWeek, and others will take a deep, hard look at their coverage and correct themselves. Or not. Is it any wonder subscriptions are falling and journalistic credibility is at an all time low?
