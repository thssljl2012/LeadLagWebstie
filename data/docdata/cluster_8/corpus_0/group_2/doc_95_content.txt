Really?&amp;nbsp; Can Merrill Lynch be in that bad of shape? It closed today at $17.07 a share. In early 2007 it was around $98.&amp;nbsp; I'm only gone for a couple of months, and the place goes to crap.&amp;nbsp; I'm a little relieved that I won't be there for all of the turmoil of a buyout, but also am somewhat saddened that a company I've worked for for all these years is coming to an end.&amp;nbsp; It happened with EF Hutton, and then with Shearson Lehman, but I never thought Merrill would be beaten down. I'll miss the bull. I'm blaming all those stupid homeowners who thought they needed more house than they could afford and took out interest only or adjustable rate mortgages, and when rates changed started whining that the mortgage companies were to blame for them losing their homes.&amp;nbsp; Wake up!&amp;nbsp; If you can't afford the payments on a traditional mortgage, you probably can afford&amp;nbsp; the house.&amp;nbsp; Buy smaller. Quit whining. Your parents didn't live in oversized homes with several cars, and big screen tvs. I'm a bit scared about what effect the market problems will have on the election.&amp;nbsp; I'm more than scared about what Obama would do if elected.&amp;nbsp; I really want to move to Australia now, but our chances are looking grim. I guess I'm going to start job hunting, but will try to keep out of the financial industry. Too much stress. So, if you know of anyone who needs a personal assistant, give them my number.
