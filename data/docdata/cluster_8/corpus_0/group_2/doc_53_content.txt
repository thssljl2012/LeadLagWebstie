It was announced last night that the Office of Thrift Supervision has intervened with the Washington Mutual operations to close them down due to withdrawals in the last week. They then turned the bank over to the FDIC - which immediatly closed a deal with JP Morgan Chase for about $2 billion. So&amp;#8230;how does this affect you and your money? It probably won&amp;#8217;t. For nearly everyone - except the shareholders - it&amp;#8217;s business as usual - your WAMU credit card will still work, your bank account is in tact, and your money is safe. The FDIC didn&amp;#8217;t lose any money on deposit insurance. It&amp;#8217;s basically a transfer of all the accounts to a bigger more secure bank that can afford the losses where WAMU couldn&amp;#8217;t alone. JP Morgan Chase plans to rebrand the stores/banks over the next 2 years to their brand. They have a large network of Chase Banks, Chase credit cards, and many other financial products including student loans. The new bank will create a new megabank - estimated to be the countries second largest behind Bank of America or CitiBank depending on how you measure it&amp;#8230; Your money is safe, you loan is the same, and your debit/credit card will still work. Business as usual. The bank probably would have survived had there not been a spike in withdrawals over the past week on bad news, but that&amp;#8217;s the way it goes.
