I've gotten many phone calls from friends and family so I thought I'd write a note to update.Merrill Lynch was bought out today by Bank of America. The merger should be finished the end of the first quarter in 2009 and although there are so many unanswered questions I'm actually quite excited by this news. I get to say I work with Courtney again, woo hoo, and the Bank of America investment side is supposed to come under the wing of Merrill Lynch. Change in such a big company is always scary and the stock market has been extremely volitile, especially with todays news but I feel confident we'll make it out in the end. For the time being, all is to remain the same. I'm sure we'll see some changes of the merger in early 2009.
