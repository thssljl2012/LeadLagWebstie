I have been engaged in an ongoing battle with the Reserve Bank of Australia in an effort to keep my house. See the Reserve thinks that I would be better off in a smaller more modest house. We currently live in a seven bedroom house in Strathmore (with pool), this may sound a little extravagant however I do have six children and they all live with me, every bedroom is full. The house is hectic but happy. Now a house this big did cost a lot but I did build (myself) an extra four bedrooms and living area, it came up very good if I do say so myself. Now all this costs money which I borrowed from a bank. Now this worries the Reserve they seem to think that what I have done is bad for me, so for my own good they have been steadily raising interest rates, in fact since they started raising rates the cost of my mortgage has gone up by almost $800 per month, apparently this is very good for me. Things are now so good that we have decided that we can&amp;#8217;t handle things getting any better so we have decided to sell. We have found a run down three bedroom house in the area which the Reserve thinks will be perfect for us, we will all have to squeeze up and a couple of the older kids will have to move out but it&amp;#8217;s for our own good. I am sure that those who run the Reserve Bank are taking similar actions, even as we speak they are probably cancelling overseas holidays and reducing the consumption of French Champagne. It makes my heart proud that the Reserve has me and my families interest at heart. So posting may be quite for a little bit while we wait for our agent to get us the best possible price and the older kids try to make arrangements for somewhere to live.
