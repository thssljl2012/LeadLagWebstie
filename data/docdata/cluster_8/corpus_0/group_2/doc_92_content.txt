What Depleted Uranium from american bombs is doing to babies in Iraq:i have plenty more, but i'll stop here. i've almost thrown up a couple times already...but maybe too many of us are just too comfortable 1000's of miles away from the truth, so perhaps everyone needs it right in thier face.courtesy of our bombs, our tax dollars, and our apathy. enjoy your starbucks, your mtv, and your next sunny day..this makes me cry.
