That plucky developer Bruce Ratner is still rallying for his $4 billion plan to turn the MTA rail yards in downtown Brooklyn into a sports arena, office and residential complex designed by Frank Gehry! Despite staunch opposition to the project's scale and use of eminent domain by the state, Ratner is promising to break ground on the project in December.   The Times speculates that his latest surge may be explained by his time-sensitive naming rights contract with Barclays Bank, which has agreed to pay $20 million a year to be attached to the arena. But the deal requires Forest City to secure the land and the financing by the end of November.   The Times also learns that because of the tanking bond market and rising construction costs, Ratner has recently asked "government officials" for as much as $100 million in additional cash for the project. (That's on top of the $300 million in subsidies and tens of millions in tax breaks already promised from the city and state.) Ratner is also counting on a favorable ruling from the Treasury Department that would let him use tax-exempt bonds to finance the arena.
