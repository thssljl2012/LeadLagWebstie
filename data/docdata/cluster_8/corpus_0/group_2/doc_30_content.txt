Fed Blotter: Citibank Worker Allegedly Plunders Customer Accounts  - Via Threat Level:  Some enterprising finance workers are finding their own solution to the growing banking crisis, judging by a spate of recent federal indictments: using their access to bank computers to plunder accounts.   Missouri Citibank employee Brandon Wyatt was charged last week with identity theft for a scheme that allegedly began in January 2006, and continued until late last month. Wyatt is accused of tapping Citibank's computers for customer information, then using it to set up checking accounts online with competing banks, including Bank of America, Washington Mutual and AmTrust.   Wyatt allegedly wire transferred customer funds from Citibank to the new accounts, then cashed them out with additional transfers, checks, debit card purchases and ATM withdrawals. His take, according to federal prosecutors in St. Louis, was at least $380,000.  &amp;nbsp;read&amp;nbsp;more&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;
