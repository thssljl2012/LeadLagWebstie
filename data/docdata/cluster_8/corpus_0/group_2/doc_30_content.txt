The Australian is running this story about the federal government considering amending the law to prevent supermarkets taking over their rivals, creating monopolies and jacking up their prices:http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24272698-601,00.htmlThese laws are welcome and long overdue.&amp;nbsp; For too long we've had to put up with favourite businesses being gobbled up by corporate predators, jobs being slashed and prices being jacked up.My particular bank - St George - is about to be gobbled up by Westpac (Worst Pac) and the friendly service and low fees I've enjoyed for many years are soon to be a thing of the past.&amp;nbsp; If I wanted to bank with Westpac I would have opened an account with them.&amp;nbsp; Now I will have no choice.The federal government should ignore threats and bluster by the business community and bring in strong anti-takeover laws.&amp;nbsp; A huge crackdown should be instituted to ensure that the public gets the best possible deal and that business is not allowed to run feral.
