I guess everyone has already heard about the news, there's lots of problems going on, and even our own Gov minister tells us not to expect too much and prepare ourselves.Banks going bankrupt, banks selling cheap, what a time to look for cheap deals as well, provided you have the money.I guess things will not be better after the election. Prepare to look for better deals when the time comes. Probably China and Russia will come to bail US out, if US keeps helping out its banks. Lol.Oh ya, those people who have AIA, which is a subsidiary of AIG, insurance policies. Don't go rushing to cancel your policies. They belong to a different category, no fear.In the worst case scenario, we will just have World War 3. Kidding..JTYSJTYS
