Here's Palin's first actual answer to an uncontrolled actual press question:Disappointed that taxpayers are called upon to bailout another one. Certainly AIG though with the construction bonds that theyre holding and with the insurance that they are holding very, very impactful to Americans so you know the shot that has been called by the Feds it's understandable but very, very disappointing that taxpayers are called upon for another one.Got that? A reader notes:You might as well point out that she got her first answer wrong. Construction bonds have nothing to do with it; AIG got in a mess selling Credit Default Swaps. They both start with C, so I guess that's what threw her.Another counters: She was not saying construction bonds are what got AIG in trouble, but that those bonds, and their normal insurance lines, are what make AIGs demise impactful enough to justify a bailout.&amp;nbsp; Dont think shes right substantively, but its an unfair shot to say she was confusing cause and impact. I cannot make out what she was trying to say. But deference, please. And no laughing in the back!
