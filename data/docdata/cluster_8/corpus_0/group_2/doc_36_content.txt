The stock market is apparently going through some sort of apocalyptic meltdown. Dozens of banks are failing, people are predicting on the order of hundreds more to follow.Of course, all my money is FDIC insured, or gone into treasury bonds, so I can't be bothered to give much of a crap.But one interesting side effect of this is that one bank, Bank of America, is buying up a lot of other failed banks cheaply. This happens to be my bank.So, does this mean that a lot of ATMs are about to become Bank of America ATMs, which charge me no fee? That could be quite nice.
