But it wasn't relevant to what I was &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; initially talking about. I've been an active member of two political &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; parties, so I do have some idea.&gt;&gt;&gt; The external evidence is that you were never aware of any of it or you &gt;&gt;&gt; wouldn't be spouting the obvious drivel you always do spout.&gt;&gt; Just because you disagree with me doesn't mean I spout drivel. Because, &gt;&gt; you see, from where I'm sitting, you spout drivel.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, let's discuss this without resorting to name-calling.&gt; &gt; No.&gt; &gt; You always spout the same nonsense.No, you do, and I always disagree with you.&gt; You claim to be politically sophisticated,  but,  while a member of two &gt; political parties you never stood for any sort of office,  which is actually &gt; quote difficult in the UK.  Most parish councils don't have enough members &gt; and just about anyone who wants to can get elected to a borough council.I never claimed to have stood for office. I was just an active party member. I gave up being active when I went to work for a newspaper and I haven't lived in England for 6 years, so it's a bit difficult being active now.&gt; You show an incredible ignorance about recent political history for someone &gt; who claims any interest,  until it is fed to you 'spoon fashion' when you &gt; invariably respond with 'well of course I knew that,  I used to be a member &gt; of two political parties'.I do not want to be "spoon-fed" by you. You have been spoon-fed yourself and think you understand what you are talking about, but you do not.&gt; &gt; Your opinions are invariably straight out of the Daily Mail,  How patronising of you to assume that my opinions are ones I adopt from newspapers. How patronising of you to assume that I am of too low intelligence (mine is Mensa-level) to form my own opinions based on the information I receive or the observations I make.Tell me, Mr Black, from where do you get your opinions? You have not told me what newspaper you read, particularly as you seem to be of the opinion that people only get their opinions from whatever newspaper they read.My father had exactly the same opinions as you do in the 1970s. At that time I read The Mirror and voted Labour but we argued like cat and dog over much the same things you and I are arguing over. The one thing we agreed on, like you and I, was Mrs Thatcher's destruction.In those days, my father read The Militant and The Morning Star.You might think you are New Labour, William, but you are too far left for that. You are stuck in the 1970s and haven't moved on. Your views aren't even mainstream so readers of this newsgroup might get a warped view of British political thinking from the stuff you write here.&gt; until someone &gt; points out that they were lying,  again,  at which point you usually say &gt; 'Well,  they're right in principle,  England really is going to the dogs'...I don't tell lies. If my opinions, analyses and observations differ from yours, that means we differ in our opinions. It does not mean I am telling lies.&gt; Your ignorant,  meretricious and have an inflated idea of your own &gt; lamentable knowledge of British political modern history, and you object &gt; violently when all this is pointed out to you.Of course I do. I come from a family of politicians (not just my father), have studied it to degree level, and have practised it.What are your credentials? == 3 of 8 ==Date: Wed, Sep 17 2008 7:21am From: "William Black"  "Renia"  wrote in message news:WvidnenN5tMhkUzVnZ2dnUVZ8vSdnZ2d@giganews.com...&gt; William Black wrote:&gt;&gt; You claim to be politically sophisticated,  but,  while a member of two &gt;&gt; political parties you never stood for any sort of office,  which is &gt;&gt; actually quote difficult in the UK.

How patronising of you to assume that I am of too low &gt; intelligence (mine is Mensa-level) to form my own opinions based on the &gt; information I receive or the observations I make.I patronise you because you invite it.'IQ' as measured in a test is not a measure of intelligence,  as you so readily prove over and over again.&gt; Tell me, Mr Black, from where do you get your opinions? You have not told &gt; me what newspaper you read, particularly as you seem to be of the opinion &gt; that people only get their opinions from whatever newspaper they read.I don't read a newspaper.  I get most of my information from the net and read a couple of weekly political magazines and Private Eye every fortnight, just like everyone else with an interest in politics in the UK.&gt; You might think you are New Labour, William, but you are too far left for &gt; that.That took some time to work out.The week he was elected I referred to Blair as 'Tory Lite' in at least three of the Newsgroups in the headers of this article.&gt;&gt;&gt; until someone points out that they were lying,  again,  at which point &gt;&gt; you usually say 'Well,  they're right in principle,  England really is &gt;&gt; going to the dogs'...&gt;&gt; I don't tell lies.No-one has yet said you did.English comprehension,  as we have already discovered,  is not one of your strengths.If my opinions, analyses and observations differ from&gt; yours, that means we differ in our opinions.
