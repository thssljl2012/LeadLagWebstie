She's allowed to take impromptu questions now. clipped from politicalticker.blogs.cnn.comSarah Palin took her first impromptu question from a reporter traveling with her campaign Wednesday while shaking hands at a restaurant called Karl's Inn of the Barristers in Cleveland. A pool reporter from the national press corps asked Palin's reaction to the federal bailout of insurance giant AIG. Palin said she is "disappointed that taxpayers are called upon to bailout another one." "Certainly AIG, though, with the construction bonds that they're holding, and with the insurance that they are holding, very, very impactful to Americans," she said. "So you know, the shot that has been called by the feds, its understandable but very, very disappointing that taxpayers are called upon for another one."
