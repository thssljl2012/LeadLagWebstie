 The latest company to be bailed out by the government, AIG Insurance, is pulling its new ad campaign. Omnicom Groups BBDO, AIGs agency working on the corporate campaign, had ironically come up with the slogan The Strength to be There, which appears in their new television commercials. Unfortunately, these commercials may be better-suited for the Federal Reserve. The solutions that AIG claims to offer clients, like risk management and protection against the nightmare of liabilities, look pretty ridiculous considering that they just received an unheard-of $85 billion dollar loan from the government. The company, who has spent $182.7 million on advertising in the past year and a half, will pull their tv ads but continue to send direct-mail and market products for their business units in the US and around the world. One of AIGs most recent direct mail pieces questions, When disaster strikes, will you have the protection you need? Quite the paradox. This whole debacle brings to mind much larger concerns about the economy in general. How can a country founded on the principles of laissez-faire capitalism have such an outrageous amount of government intervention? Are we in France? Have we become socialists? I think that this does not bode well for the future of Americas economy. Luckily, there are still great marketing opportunities out there, but youll have to work a little bit harder if your clients are in the financial sector. Looking at the ever-growing list of companies that the government has become entangled with, I cant help but to think of Ayn Rands novel, Atlas Shrugged, and the haunting question Who is John Galt? Hopefully there will still be some healthy competition and integrity in the marketing industry.
