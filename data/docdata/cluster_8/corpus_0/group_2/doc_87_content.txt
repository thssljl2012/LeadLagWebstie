Something that does not make sense at all...AIG&amp;nbsp;Insurance is crying money woes like all of us. My question to them is &amp;quot;What about the Ultra Exclusive Ultra Private Country Club you have in mid-state NY?&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot; In my course of my career, if one was losing money in a business, certain items would be cut back or eliminated. Assets would be shed, and jobs cut, and the way of doing business would be altered to return to profitability. Now I am not looking for a round of Golf at some club I know I can not get into. (If you saw me golf, you would know why!)&amp;nbsp;A background on this golf course is very few people know about it. If you are someone high up on the AIG&amp;nbsp;food chain, you have access to this club to bring prospective clients, etc. You are not told to pick up pace of play, and the food is phenomenal!&amp;nbsp;(I have not eaten it, but I have heard through my industry contacts.)&amp;nbsp;You could take 12 hours to play a round of golf without repercussions from anyone. It is there basically as a 5 star brown-nosing asset for more money. Your problems AIG are like any other problems - the difference is you are bigger and crying harder. Either open your course up to be a normal private course, and make the money off of that, or sell the damn thing!&amp;nbsp;Be like any other business in the US, and take it!&amp;nbsp;A&amp;nbsp;phrase I was always told, and I take to heart, is more apt for AIG&amp;nbsp;situation &amp;quot;You Made Your Bed, Now Sleep In It!!&amp;quot;
