Financial 9/11?Lehman Bros goes belly up and AIG gets an $85b bailoutWhere do you fit in and what are the ramifications of what has happened?I daresay America will not hit the third world country mark especially if taxpayers can borrow AIG $85 billion and all of this because of the crashing housing market and in our pockets amelting dollar.Lehman Brothers goes down in smoke and Merrill Lynch is being taken over by BANK of AMERICA?Which anybody withgood senseknew thatthe housing gold mine was a gigantic balloon.... I saw houses in raggedy neighborhoods go from $80,000 to $400,000 and people were buying them like cake...with SUBPRIME LOANS?!?!?So now from all of the bad investments into people buying houses that they could not afford and now losing them we face a huge situation. It feels like a gigantic earthquake that people are not aware of at all.This is something that everyone should study as they make their vote this fall because these things will effect the way we live in the US of A.A lot of us have been following the story since Friday but if you have notI included a clip of some exchanges on the issue.          ..And what do we think about the average CEO making an excess $11 million dollars a year? What does one do when you lose your job after making that much yesterday?I would suppose offshore account would be a huge key word.What about the thousands of people in the US alone not to mention all over the world who are now out of a job?Cause you know like Gwen Gutherie used to sang...Ain't nothing going on but the rent.This willaffect theelection because money mattersright now. Especially for the rich and for big biz.Please study the economic agenda of all of the candidates before you vote. I also wonder:Where did the Federal Reserve get 85 billion bucks from to help AIG?I guess we ain't broke as I thought....but then again this was an emergency of large porportions.It makes you think if big time companies are being affected almost to the point of devastation(as if AIG Insurance had gone belly up as well then we would be in a world economic crisis)Then what more can possibly go wrong. I mean is it time to put your cash in a steel rimmed shoebox and hide it in the wall?That is not a suggestion; don't blame me if you lose your money!The average American may not be concerned about Wall Street but more about being able to pay your mortgage and pay for gas to go in your car. The good news is that with everything that is happening the price of gas is going DOWN!Do you have your money invested anywhere or has the AIG Insurance issuebeen on your mindany?Is what is happening on Wall Street of any concern to you?Let's pray for our economy folks.Tell me what is on your mind.WHO'S FIRST?
