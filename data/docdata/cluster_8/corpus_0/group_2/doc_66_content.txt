Well my Father was born right at the start of the Great Depression, I am starting to think he will get to see another one. Hang on tight this is going to get rough. Oh yea I do find it funny that AIG turned Jen down for life insurance two weeks ago and now they had to be bought by Uncle Sam to save their asses. The sad news is that over one hundred Waffle Houses in the South may go under. They filed for chapter seven. That includes the ones in Florida. This would be the worst thing to happen to mankind since the killing of Christ or the bombing of Hiroshima. Where will the road worn and weary get their hash browns and raisin toast in order to keep their stool firm ? Now I don't want anyone coming on here and talking ill of Waffle House. There are a few poser places out there but they do not match up well. Oh, I need to correct that. I did go to a Waffle's Plus on the side of I10 in Mississippi one morning and it was like walking into Heaven. I thought I had died. The three girls behind the counter were like angels sent down to earth. It was Rod Serling weird. Ok I am falling out here. Great ready for the bread lines, the bail outs, gas rations, and all the other doom and gloom.
