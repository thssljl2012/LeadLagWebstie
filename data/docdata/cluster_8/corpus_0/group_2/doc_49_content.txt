This hotel shit is really getting on my nerves. And no ones helping me with this shit. i know it was my fault....wel not really, for fucking up my bank of america account, but now when i try to book some shit, the main component is a fucking debit card. fuck!! grrr.  And I'm not even really being helped. So yeah, fuck. So its not my fault when we don't get a god damn room for awa! its everybody elses!  And who died and made me the driver of everyone? hmm. I already hate fucking driving. I got into an accident saturday. so fuck that shit. No I'm not driving. And fuck no I'm not helping you ride marta....A monkey could ride marta. I once saw a fucking BLIND man manuvering his way through Atlanta on MArta. Its not hard. It is kinda filthy, but your not a princess. Psssh, no onw showed me ho to ride marta. When I was all alone at metro point, and had to get to my first day of class by following the crowd, and EADING GOOD DAMN MAPS for fuck sake. Anyway. When we don't get a hotel @ AWA I'll say I told you so. Cus try as I might im not a dumbass, Im just a broke nigga. You should probably start a fund raiser for me....And who has helped me with this hotel, tsuki, but who hasn't? the main person whose gunna benieft from it &gt;:P fuck, well besides that i got my braces (completely) off today, and I'm a happy little girl :D
