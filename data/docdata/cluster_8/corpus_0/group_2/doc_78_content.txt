I am upset, I have always had respect for Bank of America, but the past few weeks Bank of America has well made me not so happy, to the point as if I should even continue having a banking relationship with them. I am not prefect and every so often I overdraw my account. It happens to every one, and well because I live a distance and well I work in a bank, I general don't always get to do my banking except well late at night. so lots of things must be done online or atm for my self. But last week I noticed I got a fee for a transaction that posted to my account when well fund were there to cover. Well when I called someone told me that it was caused by a transaction that was pending and had not received final Authorization. Well you see that does not hold well in my book, because I know how Bank of America works and well other then the fact that they have increased how many fees they will charge you in a day. They fee policy has stayed the same. When I worked there it was i known fact that if funds were deposited or when the transactions has posted and funds were there to cover it no fee was accessed because the transactions them self are not considered cleared until they post because of processing process. Well it turns out that Bank of America has changed that and well there was no notification of those new policy of fee charging. So I have received in two weeks over 120 dollars in fees for transactions that posted to my account with funds to pay as a Positive Ending balance. I am upset and They will not hear the end of this, if it is not fixed, Relationship is ended and i am moving. It will be an easy move. No worries on my part. Because I know how to do it. But man they will make me upset. In fact I just might end it because of the situatin.
