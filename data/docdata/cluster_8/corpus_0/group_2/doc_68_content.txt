From CBA-R35 BlogI have seen a few pictures of broken gearboxes, but nothing I have found so far on the internet.  I have mentioned a few times on forums that its not just the clutches that are giving up, but the gears within the transmission. I have heard a couple different reasons for it, but if its like most transmissions its from the gears slamming together. However in a twin clutch transmission, I would think that we wouldn't see something like this.  I wonder what Redline Shockproof Light would do to the transmission and clutch assembly. The stock GR6 fluid is a type of ATF. We have run Redline Shockproof in place of ATF's in certain transmissions. The transmission in the R34 GT-R, the Getrag V160 does not like Shockproof gearoil. The GR6 also may not like it as the clutch is wet, and adding a thicker fluid may effect the lockup of the clutch. Ian at CBA-R35 seems to think its excessive launch control, however I don't think thats what actually did this.  ...
