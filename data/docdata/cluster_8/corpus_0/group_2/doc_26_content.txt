How safe is your bank account? The US government has stepped in to save insurance giant AIG from bankruptcy. AIG has received a $85bn loan, in return for an 80% stake in the firm. In the UK the economic situation is also worsening as the credit crunch takes hold. By surely during all this upheaval the one question which we all want to know the answer to is who is going to win Strickly Come Dancing? Only kidding it is &amp;#8216;how is this going to effect me?&amp;#8217; Whilst the rising cost of living is bound to effect you the chances are you are your money is safe if it is in a bank account. It is very unusual for a bank to collapse and if it does your savings may still be safe. If you have up to 35,000 in a bank then it is protected. This is 35,000 per institution not per bank so if you have two accounts at banks owned by the same institution then the amounts of these are added together. I&amp;#8217;m no expert on banking but the general advice for those of us who don&amp;#8217;t have thousands invested all over the place is not to panic. People getting worried and removing all their money can only make an institution less safe. If you have a standard current account with a high street bank (HSBC for instance) then you have no reason to panic. Your account is protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). Online saving accounts from UK banks are also protected. If you are lucky enough to have more than 35,000 in savings then you could split this between different financial institutions for safety.
