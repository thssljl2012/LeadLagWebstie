It wasn't long ago that both associates and partners regarded moving in-house as a "golden ticket." Better hours, comparable pay, and a sweet "Executive Vice-President" title.   Now? Ask former firm lawyers who went over to Bear Stearns, Lehman, Merrill, or WaMu how their new gigs are working out. For that matter, ask attorneys at JPMorgan Chase, BoA, or Barclays how secure they feel about their jobs.  As financial services firms break up and merge, what happens to the in-house attorneys caught up in the mix?   Much of the value from in-house counsel comes from keeping as much work off the big firm plate as possible. It's a volume business. When trading is tepid and profits non-existent, businesspeople often turn a greedy eye to in-house attorney salaries. Remember, it's not like the businesspeople really like the lawyers hanging around anyway. It's more of a "you want me on that wall, you need me on that wall" type of situation.   But should an in-house attorney get laid off, how easy is it for them to get back into the Biglaw pipeline? Are firms going to be interested in hiring corporate attorneys with years of expertise in business platforms that are no longer viable?  If you can't go in-house, what exit options remain for Biglaw corporate associates? Litigators can always go litigate somewhere. There are lots of frivolous lawsuits just begging to be filed (and defended against). But for corporate attorneys, are you better off just keeping your head down and doing your best to ride out the storm?   Alternative career resolution ideas are welcome in the comments.
