We're becoming Socialist within the space of a year. First the Feds bailed out idiots who couldn't read the fine print on their mortgages, then banks who loaned in such a predatorial manner, and now insurance companies like AIG. Insurance companies? How the heck are they struggling? I believe the smaller the government (within reason), the leaner, meaner, greener, better. I believe many government functions should be given out to companies who have more incentive to keep things cost efficient and the government should focus on the important parts of laws. And bailouts for people who aren't reasonable make me so angry! So we, who have tried hard, been careful, saved money, are having our valuable tax dollars go to rescue idiots? So they get to live better than us before, as they spent frivolously, and now after, because the government is trying to keep status quo? Argh!
