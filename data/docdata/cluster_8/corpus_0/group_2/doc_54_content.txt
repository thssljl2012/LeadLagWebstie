As I begin to gather information on the renovation of the High Point Road corridor I ponder the idea of the name itself. Over six miles of a main roadway that promotes our sister city thousands of times a day. A sister city that we&amp;#8217;re not warm and cozy with. The hijacking of Lazyboy comes to mind. Their arrogance in not addressing parking and price gouging problems for the furniture market has cost Greensboro plenty. For years there&amp;#8217;s been confusion in explaining to people, &amp;#8220;no, it&amp;#8217;s not in High Point, it&amp;#8217;s High Point Road in Greensboro.&amp;#8221; My idea is to sell the name of the roadway to the corporation willing to make the largest contribution to the City of Greensboro. Auction it on E-Bay. Bondless renovation. Bank of America Stadium? Why not &amp;#8220;Bank Of America Boulevard&amp;#8221;? You can be sure that BOA would renovate to the max. A nice median, poles down and wires underground, well lit, clean and tidy. The profits from their &amp;#8220;charge it now even if you can&amp;#8217;t afford it&amp;#8221; VISA marketing plan could be put back into the community. I&amp;#8217;m sure there&amp;#8217;s some kind of legal stipulation to prevent this or it would have been done long ago. And upon thinking further&amp;#8230;Taco Bell Road or ToysRUs Street just doesn&amp;#8217;t have a nice ring to it. And don&amp;#8217;t even think about the Pure Platinum Parkway or Chester&amp;#8217;s Avenue.
