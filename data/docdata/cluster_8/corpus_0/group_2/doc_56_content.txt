Can I be allowed a little bit of pleasure in seeing how Barclays Bank have captured part of corporate Wall Street. Well done Bob Diamond and John Varley. Methinks it wouldn&amp;#8217;t have happened if it were not for the fact that as a country we&amp;#8217;re open to outsiders and are happy for them to make their careers here. Bob Diamond is an American, it surely was easier for him to do the deal than if a Brit were to try.
