If you&amp;#8217;re an insurance company with huge exposure as a result of guaranteeing securities you didn&amp;#8217;t really understand because you thought you could make a bunch of money by doing so, Uncle Sam will lend you $85 billion to get you over the hump. If you&amp;#8217;re a homeowner with huge exposure as a result of signing a mortgage that you really didn&amp;#8217;t understand in order to buy a house and because you thought you could make a bunch of money by doing so, you&amp;#8217;re on your own. If, on the other hand, you were responsible in your selection of housing and mortgage instruments, and are going under as a result of a catastrophic health problem beyond your control, or because you&amp;#8217;re stuck in Iraq and can&amp;#8217;t afford your payments, you&amp;#8217;re still on your own. Too many things in this country are just completely fucked up. UPDATE: Just to be clear, I&amp;#8217;m not sure it&amp;#8217;s a bad thing that the Feds have stepped in, considering what might happen if they didn&amp;#8217;t. But it seems to me that there&amp;#8217;s lots of talk about individuals being responsible for their debts, and that talk disappears when enough zeroes are involved. $85 billion. This, from Atrios: AIG, we must remember, is primarily an insurance company, with substantial other sidelines, and is very far from the Fed&amp;#8217;s normal domain which is commercial banks. Fed going to make a loan GM next? Not crazy given its heavy equity in GMAC. When Chrysler was given loan guarantees of $1.2 billion, about $3.2 billion in today&amp;#8217;s money, over 25 years ago it was like a nuclear-sized event. And it required an act of Congress.
