bluetooth device that i can plug into my ear that beeps if there is a sms or call on my handphone. I don't like making my hp ringer loud at all because i have a 1 year old niece who comes to my place everyday. She tends to have a bad case of light sleeping. A hairpins fall can wake her or at least cause her to squirm in bed for afew seconds before she finds her nice sleeping position again. I too don't like lugging my phone downstairs. (for those people who don't know me personally i live in a terrace house and i leave my phone in my room most of the time.) I don't ignore people, i don't want to be labeled as someone who does and i definitely will not ignore my friends. Dinner was really quiet today as my parents were out at a memorial service of a friend who passed away. My sis was stuck in office (she works for barclays and im pretty sure you know what happened today). So it was just my brother and I. We talked about our hobby, that of aquascaping or &amp;quot;the art of planting in a fish tank&amp;quot; and the thought of me helping him rescape the crazy 5footer tank of his. &amp;nbsp; It took me a whole afternoon from 3pm till 8pm stopping for dinner to finish planting and you can imagine how sore my back was after planting it. Anyways i have my own tank right now. Its a 2ft by 1ft by 1ft rock scape. It was just planted last weekend and hopefully in 2 weeks time it should start to flourish to appear abit nicer.
