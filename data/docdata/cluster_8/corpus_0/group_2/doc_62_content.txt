Recently, every media both domestic and international emphasize on the falling of the fourth largest investment bank in USA, Lehman Brothers&amp;#8230;This issue has worsenUSA financial turmoileven more. This is still become thecontinuum of whateveryone called as subprime mortgage crisiswhichtriggered by the falling of twolargest mortgage backing entities in USA,Fannie Maeand Freddie mac (somehow it soundslike a husband and wife name ^^), stands forFederal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. The continuum followed by Lehman Brother and Merill Lynch (now sold to Bank of America), it somehow reminds me tothe downfall of Enron and Athur Anderson, but the difference is this issue affect broader industry on every nation. Can we imagine how many employees walked home with no jobs and no home?? Ironically, they lived in the first superpower country&amp;#8230;.. Iraq war, lack of oil resources, global warming,economics turmoil,racial issue, all thoseissues lead us to the next question, would the next president be able to solve those problem?? or at least make things better for their citizen and the rest of the world?? American, you all should choose carefully with logic and hope on the next election, cause your decisionwill determineyour own future and the rest of the world. Somehow the American, realized or not,hasbegun toreevaluate the term &amp;#8216;Right or Wrong, is still my country&amp;#8217;. Rather than being a superpower country which control all oil-related thing,the governmentshould revise their public policy and give more attention to their citizen&amp;#8217;s wealthy.They are all citizen, not politician nor government, they deserve a better life in their own country.
