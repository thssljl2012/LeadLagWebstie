The US government just gave AIG $85 BILLION. Fucking republicans. New Orleans is still a wasteland and instead of helping THE PEOPLE who have lost everything, the G.O.P. thinks its a better idea to fork over $85 bil to a fucking insurance giant.If AIG is going broke, fucking let them! Insurance companies fuck the little guy on a daily basis and if they can't even keep their own shit going, then fuck them.I fucking hate the rich. Its not enough for them to have more money than they could ever possibly spend, no siree! The greedy motherfuckers want to drive our entire country into the dirt to feed their greed.FUCK REPUBLICANS!
