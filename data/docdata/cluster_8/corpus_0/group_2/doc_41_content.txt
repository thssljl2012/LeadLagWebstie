Last night I checked my husband's credit score and it was lower than a few years ago.  He doesn't have a lot of credit cards but they are quite used up, so that's why his credit score dropped below prime.  My credit despite having hardly any is actually better than his (prime) but most of it is student loans and my 2 credit cards haven't been open very long (no more than 3 years at most).    I need to transfer my Bank of America balance (hate BOA) to a 0% offer from my other credit card.    It's shocking to see how low the credit score was, but at the same time, I'm glad we are tackling our debt head on.  We have a year to two years to increase our credit score so we can buy a house.  We will be seeing a financial adviser to see how we can tackle this debt.               Send to a friend
