1975 NY Daily News Headline Notable headlines&amp;#8230; 1975: Gerald Ford To New York City: Drop Dead. 2008: George Bush To AIG: Are You Sure $85 Billion Is Enough? Of course, headlines rarely tell the whole story.  But my, my, how times have changed.  As the above Daily News front page shows, a drop of 12 points in the Dow was big news in 1975.  This past Monday, it took a one-day drop in the Dow of 500 points to make Wall Street nervous.  Oh, and Washington didn&amp;#8217;t let New York City drop dead after all.  The Federal government agreed to a bailout in the form of $2.3 billion in short-term loans, thereby allowing the City to avoid bankruptcy (read about it at americanheritage.com).  These days, $2.3 billion is chump change. The Federal bailout announced yesterday of American International Group (AIG), the 18th largest company in the world,  gives a whole new meaning to the term &amp;#8220;economic stimulus&amp;#8220;.   Who insures the insurers?  You do.  It&amp;#8217;s also a sign that many people are getting very nervous about the economy.  How nervous?  Economic collapse nervous.  Black Monday, 1929 nervous.  Better start polishing those apples. We love some of the nautical references you often see in annual reports and prospectuses, used as euphemisms for real bad financial news .  Phrases like &amp;#8220;staying the course&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;rough sailing&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;turbulent waters&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;sailing into a headwind&amp;#8221;, etc.  In our mind, the U.S. economy resembles a ship that is being tossed about by increasingly turbulent seas.  As the waves get higher and higher, our ship runs the risk of encountering one that will push it past the tipping point.  We think an $85 billion Federal bailout of AIG says that we&amp;#8217;re not the only ones worried about the ship going down. Hey, General Motors&amp;#8230; Are you paying attention? GM has gotten a lot more press than AIG, regarding their hemorrhaging of red ink.  In our opinion, all they need to do is a bit more hand wringing, and then show up on Uncle Sam&amp;#8217;s doorstep, hat in hand, and ask for a few bucks.  How much do you need, Rick ?  $100 billion ? $200 billion ?  more ?  As we&amp;#8217;ve written, the death of GM might not be a bad thing, but GM&amp;#8217;s demise might scare too many people, so OK, Mr. Wagoner, here&amp;#8217;s your money.  Next in line ? And it appears that in the past few days,  that line has gotten a lot longer.  Another down-on-their-luck financial giant, Lehman Brothers, apparently didn&amp;#8217;t get that whole hat-in-hand routine right.  Merrill Lynch has sold it&amp;#8217;s soul to Bank of America.  Do you see a trend developing here ? It&amp;#8217;s a good thing Uncle Sam owns those Intaglio presses, over at The Bureau of Engraving and Printing.  Who says the Treasury Department doesn&amp;#8217;t have a sense of humor ?  The BEP website is at &amp;#8220;moneyfactory.gov&amp;#8221;.  But the people at AIG probably think they should call it rescueme.gov.  To paraphrase Popeye&amp;#8217;s J. Wellington Wimpy, &amp;#8220;I will gladly pay you Tuesday, for a bailout Today&amp;#8221;. With Walmart&amp;#8217;s interest in expanding into banking and financial services, and given Walmart&amp;#8217;s runaway profits, we&amp;#8217;re kind of surprised there wasn&amp;#8217;t a Walmart-AIG merger.  It makes a lot of sense to us.  They could sell AIG insurance policies at an AIG kiosk in every Walmart store, right next to the toilet paper and Pampers. The AIG bailout sort of makes the economic stimulus checks the rest of us got from our rich Uncle seem stingy by comparison.  It also begs the question&amp;#8230; Who&amp;#8217;s next ?
