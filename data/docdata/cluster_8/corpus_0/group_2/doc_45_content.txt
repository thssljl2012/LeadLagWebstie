 It&amp;#8217;s truly an amazing experience to stand beneath the new Wachovia tower and watch the make-shift elevators glide up and down and the cranes rooted to the face of the building twist and turn and lift. Up top, there&amp;#8217;s the monster segmented arm of a concrete delivery machine at the very top pouring the footings for additional floors.  The tower already commands the skyline view, even with the Bank of America tower nearby. It now pokes through the trees from a distance and says loudlyI am a contender.  The girls road to the grocery with daddy the other night. We&amp;#8217;ve taken the train more this week than all of last month just for the memories. We all love the train.  Erick made Monday take your Wolfy to work day and after lunch, brought her to his office so she could hang out and see what daddy does during the day. At first she was content, but soon Erick discovered a message on his board, &amp;#8220;Imnothabby&amp;#8221; Sensing Wolfy might not be into the whole programming for the banking industry thing, he spent some time helping her redirect her focus on what makes her &amp;#8220;happy.&amp;#8221;  Horses. Horses make her happy.  I found these photos on Erick&amp;#8217;s phone. Naturally there were five or six photos of nice cars. I&amp;#8217;m not into the whole car thing, but even I must admit living in Uptown has spoiled us. Just last night we saw a Rolls and a Maserati parked on the same block. We stand out with our &amp;#8216;99 Ford pick-up, but I like it anyway. At least there&amp;#8217;s no rust! Soon we&amp;#8217;ll be back in Subaruville.  Oh! And it&amp;#8217;s currently ten degrees colder in Charlotte than in TC.
