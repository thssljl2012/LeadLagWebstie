silicon.com 10 Sep 2008 Barclays will be giving away 50,000 single use contactless payment cards at this weekend&amp;#8217;s Thames Festival to get consumers used to the idea of the &amp;#8216;wave and pay&amp;#8217; tech. Festival goers will be able to pick up one of the one-off cards on either Saturday or Sunday and use the stored credit to pay for a drink at Coffee Republic at Jubilee Gardens on London&amp;#8217;s South Bank. The coffee outlet will house six of the 6,000 readers able to take Barclays contactless payments in the UK. Barclays announced its first contactless credit card a year ago. The card, called OnePulse, can be used for contactless payments and as an Oyster card, and also as a standard credit card. The bank recently told silicon.com it will be expanding the range of plastic able to make contactless payments, as it seeks to have a million wave and pay cards in the hands of its customers by the end of this year.
