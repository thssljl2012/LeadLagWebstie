               Disclaimer:  The "you" spoken about below is meant to be a collective "you" of the American people.  Consider this a general op-ed piece, and open letter to America.Want to know who is to blame for the current mortgage meltdown?  Want to know who is to blame for thousands of employees losing their jobs at Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns?  Want to know who is to blame for tens of thousands of retirees delaying retirement because of loses in their 401(K)?  Want to know who almost caused a worldwide economic collapse that prompted the U.S. Government to bail out failing AIG, the nations largest insurer?  Well, it was you.Yes, you.  The new American.  The one who doesnt have to work hard for anything.  The one who thinks the world should be handed to you on a silver platter.  Yes, you  the new American.  The one who lives entirely beyond his means.  The one who thinks debt is normal.  The one who, according to studies, is literally 30 days away from poverty if anything catastrophic ever happened (because you have no savings, no retirement, and so much debt that if you ever lost your job youd be out of money in less than 30 days).You are to blame.But I guess I cant blame you entirely because I dont think you were told the truth.  You just wanted a house.  A house you couldnt afford.  Except they told you that you could afford it.  Right?  If you just got the interest-only plan you could afford the house of your dreams.  Dont worry about saving up, you can get that house with no money down.  This is the story you were told and you believed it. Now dont get me wrong.  Im sure there was fine print on the mortgage you signed.  But, lets face it, that fine print is hard to read.  And Im sure the lender never told you about that fine print because, well, they just wanted to sell you a mortgage.  So, if you havent taken a look at the fine print, let me try to explain it to you.The initial rate on an unconventional (sometimes called sub-prime) loan only lasts for a short period of time, typically anywhere from one to five years.  After that point, the rate will escalate.  It will escalate to a point where if you bought as much house as you could afford on the unconventional loan rate, you will no longer be able to afford your house once the rate escalates.  You were probably told not to worry about this, because when the rate escalated all you would need to do would be to refinance the loan  possibly into another unconventional loan.For two years, youve heard the term housing bubble talked about on the news.  Investor-type talking heads on your TV would spew for hours about their worries regarding when the bubble will burst.  More than likely, you didnt really understand what they meant by housing bubble.  Heres the deal.  A lot of money got loaned out into the world in the last several years for people to buy houses.  Many people chose an unconventional loan option in order to get the house that they wanted.  Many people bought into the notion that there was nothing to worry about because when the loan escalated, they would just refinance.  Heres where the bubble burst.  That money loaned was based on the value of your house growing.  Meaning, if after three years your loan escalated, you could refinance the loan.  And since your home would probably be valued at more than what you paid for it, you could afford the refinanced home loan. POP!Home values are down 27% nationally from one year ago.  If you bought an unconventional loan three years ago and you try to refinance it today, the odds are you paid more for your house three years ago than its worth today.  You cant refinance now.  You cant afford to.  And, you cant afford the new escalated interest rate for your home loan.POP!And you cant blame Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.  They didnt loan money to people to buy houses they couldnt afford.  They are investment brokerage firms.  They only invested in funds that were heavy in home builders and mortgage lenders.  When the home builders and mortgage lenders tanked, so did Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.POP!And this brings us to AIG.  How did an insurance firm get caught up in this madness?  AIG carries an insurance-like product that protects companies from default on debt.  Want to start naming how many companies have defaulted on debt created by the housing bubble?POP!Tuesday evening, the U.S. Government became an 80% owner of the largest insurance company in the Nation.  They used your money to save an insurance company from bankruptcy because they insured companies who defaulted on debt that they loaned to you to buy that house that you couldnt afford to begin with.But you just wanted a nice house, right?  You never intended for people to lose jobs, companies to go out of business, and retirees to be forced to work longer.  And now, in what might be the cruelest irony of all  it has become almost impossible to get a home loan these days.  Thats almost laughable.A lot of media types today as saying that the cause of our current mortgage crisis is the greed of big business.  That may be true, but it all started with the greed of one person  you.  Welcome to the new American economy  it could all very well be smoke and mirrors.
