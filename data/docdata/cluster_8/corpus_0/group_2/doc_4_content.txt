I am struggling to find something to write, and yet I feel as though I SHOULD write, so, here goes&amp;#8230; Last week our car died on the corner of a country road. I put my foot on the gas and the engine revved, but it wouldn&amp;#8217;t go anywhere. Then all the dashboard lights came on and the steering went. A nice man who lived across the street came over and pushed me into his driveway to my little Chevy wouldn&amp;#8217;t get pulverized. I spent the next 90 minutes or so sitting in this guy&amp;#8217;s front yard, trying to reach my husband and our insurance company (the newly rescued AIG!) Eventually, I got a ride and the car got a tow. Turns out it was the fuel pump that died, to the tune of up to $400. Amusing, considering I bought the car for $500. But you get what you pay for, so I guess I&amp;#8217;m going to have to eat $400. My big project for the day is cleaning out my office. That may sound like no big deal to you, but you haven&amp;#8217;t seen my office. It&amp;#8217;s pretty sad. I probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t even bother with it, except that I need a place to work on my book (the dining room table ain&amp;#8217;t cuttin&amp;#8217; it!), and I need to prepare for a speaking gig I&amp;#8217;m doing 2 weeks from today. I started insulin yesterday, with the help of my brother-in-law, who used to inject my mother-in-law before she passed away. Turns out the needle used to give me an insulin injection is actually smaller than the needle used to check my blood sugar. I got used to stabbing myself in the fingers to check my sugar, so I think I will be able to get used to this. Talk to you guys later!
