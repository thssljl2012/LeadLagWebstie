After much perusing of quilt books and magazines, I have FINALLY decided what I'm going to do with these!Stay tuned!  I can't give away all the secrets right now!  Gotta get you to come back ya know!  ;o)Hope your week was fine!  I'm extremely glad it's Friday!  I'm so sick of three-letter-acronyms!  AIG!  UGH!  I'm in the insurance business....and this week was filled to the guts with meeting after meeting after meeting about AIG.  I found myself sitting in these meetings thinking of yarn and fabric and wondering why in the world I spend so many hours of every day dealing with this stuff!  UGH!  Then there was that OTHER three-letter-acronym...  DPN.  Double pointed needles were NOT my friend when I tried to teach myself sock knitting.  Perhaps I'm more of a Magic Loop kinda gal.  Has anyone taught themself to knit socks with the Magic Loop method?  Any pointers?Okay--stay tuned for quilt progress!  I'm heading down to the studio to figure out what background or backgroundS I will be using with those yummy blues and poison green!!!*Peace!
