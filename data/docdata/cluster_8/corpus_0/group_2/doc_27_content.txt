Well, things are getting much better around here. I was able to open a checking account with Wachovia on my own (which is weird cause I still owe Bank of America $1000..eeek!), my mom has sold me her Mazda Tribute so now I don't feel to worthless, and I started my job yesterday which shockingly I'm excited about. Of course you could hardly get me to admit that I'm working at Publix and making diddly squat but it doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm thankful to have a job, a car, and a smidge of independence which has always been very important to me. I still have my ups and down's, and sometimes weird things happen to me or around me and I feel like Zack has a hand in it sometimes. Just wanted to let everyone know I'm not going so crazy anymore. I'm feeling better and looking forward to the future.&amp;nbsp; Love you guys
