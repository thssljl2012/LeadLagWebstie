Given the collapse of Lehman and the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America, which essentially leaves only 2 of the 5 independent brokerages on Wall Street still standing....I can pretty safely say I will be unemployed after I graduate.&amp;nbsp; So now the question is what to do about my future?&amp;nbsp; I've never really worried about it, since I THOUGHT I was in a good industry, but what use is that when the industry itself probably won't be hiring for the next few years and even when it does, the pay will be significantly lower and probably not worth the hours required.&amp;nbsp; Not only is finance in a coma right now, but the credit crisis it caused has affected everything to do with corporations (e.g. consulting, marketing, working for any large company) and is slamming into the economy as a whole.THIS&amp;nbsp;IS&amp;nbsp;SO&amp;nbsp;UNFAIR.&amp;nbsp; Had I graduated ONE&amp;nbsp;YEAR&amp;nbsp;EARLIER, I could have found a job.&amp;nbsp; But now it's near impossible.&amp;nbsp; What should I do for 2 years?&amp;nbsp; Should I change fields?&amp;nbsp; Move out of the country (to another country that's slowly turning towards a recession?)??&amp;nbsp; AUGH OTL;
