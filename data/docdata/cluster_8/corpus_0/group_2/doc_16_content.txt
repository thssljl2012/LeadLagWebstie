 Opportunistic cybersquatters  are registering the domain names of potential merged banks to sell them on or  raise advertising revenue. One group benefitting from the banking woes is cybersquatters  people who  register online domain names cheaply before the corporations themselves can  register them.   As news of the Lehman Brothers collapse surfaced, cybersquatters had already  purchased the names barclayslehman.com, hsbclehman.com, hsbclehmanbrothers.com  and bofalehman.com, to cover potential merged names.   In anticipation of further mergers, domain names for a combined Lloyds TSB  with HBOS have already been registered. Meanwhile various domain names for Bank  of America Merrill Lynch have already been listed for sale on ebay, with prices  ranging from US$5 to US$2,050. In one listing it instructs interested parties to  contact bofaml@gmail.com.   Research from digital brand manager, CitizenHawk, states that over 10,000  domain names infringe on copyright or trademarks in the banking sector alone.    Click-through value   Jonathan Robinson, Chief Operating Officer of NetNames, describes the  click-through value, a cash flow that they generate in the whole world of  online advertising. But these copy-cat websites do not stop there. There's  even automated software that will populate a website with relevant content,"  said Robinson.   While once the domain names would have been registered simply for the  potential profit of selling them on, now pay-per-click advertising has made the  process far more lucrative for potential cyber-squatters. These domain names can  generate advertising revenue for every web user that comes to the website,  looking for the bank. Sometimes the click through revenue is more lucrative than  the potential sale.   "It shows how there are opportunists out there waiting to pounce on any  event," says Robinson. "For anyone working in the mergers and acquisitions area,  this is a key area to focus on in the due diligence process  One can't wait  until after the deal is announced or the product is launched."
