After pondering this financial crisis, and the media surrounding it, I've come to the conclusion that the Media has become habitual liars, and cannot tell the truth.The Bailout. 700 Billion....All the fault of some poor people who either lied on their mortgages or just couldnt pay on it, right?First...700 Billion? Estimates last year "between $380 billion and $480 billion is based on a "reasonable" loss rate assumption of 44 percent" http://www.reuters.com/article/gc06/idUSN1417151920071114 Are we to believe that losses were nearly DOUBLE their "Reasonable" Estimate?Secondly, the fault. Is it the fault of the subprime mortage holder?Any investor knows that investments carry a drawback....RISK. If you aren't familiar with the mess, mortgages were bundled together into one big securities package, then insured, then bought by the huge banks. Now does any of those steps remove risk? Insurance is the closest idea, but you don't remove the risk, you just share some of it with the insurance companies (which is why AIG failed)Subprime Mortgages existed for a reason. To allow those with bad credit buy a house. Bad CREDIT IS THE 1 Measure of RISK! Yet, they used those risky securities in their profit forcasts, to leverage for MORE CREDIT to issue to MORE SUBPRIME BORROWERS!Who is at fault here? The Borrower? or the person that believed you could continue to loan to broke people on the basis that other broke people would pay them back?Recently in Kansas City, The KC STAR and other organizations tried to make us believe that racial stereotyping blacks as "dressing certain ways" and being against dress codes that don't let you dress like that would be combating racismhttp://www.kansascity.com/115/story/779239.htmlSimultaneously, the Climate Change crowd try to make us believe 2 opposites. Some caved in to the overwhelming data that the temperature was cooling and that ice was reforming, but still insisted that it was due to global warming and manmade climate change and that it was still a problem (http://in.news.yahoo.com/139/20080913/981/tsc-antarctic-ice-growth-is-one-of-the-o.html) While others were raising fears over higher temperatures and melting ice&amp;nbsp; http://features.csmonitor.com/environment/2008/06/12/arctic-sea-ice-melting-faster-than-expected/..and finally Osama Bin Ladenhttp://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/07/17/attack/main515468.shtmlhttp://www.teamliberty.net/id267.html
