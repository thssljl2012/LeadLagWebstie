Bank of America Corp. has reportedly reached a sponsorship agreement with the Yankees, beating out fellow competitor, JP Morgan &amp;amp; Chase. Sources familiar with the deal said last week it was worth more than the New York Mets deal with Citibank and Barclays deal with the New Jersey Nets new home, each of which was said to be for an average of $20 million a year over 20 years. But another source said the Yankees deal was valued at several million dollars less than that per year. What does this mean, exactly? The deal is said to include a comprehensive financial relationship between the franchise and the bank. It also offers BofA a vast array of inventory within the new ballpark, which is slated to open next year, including prime locations for signs and a logo on all Yankees tickets. As long as we don&amp;#8217;t have to see a Bank of America logo on team uniforms and there are ATM&amp;#8217;s available throughout the ballpark, I don&amp;#8217;t think that we&amp;#8217;ll dwell much on this partnership.
