Henry Hazlitt's wonderful book, Economics in One Lesson, can be summed up thusly: "The bad economist sees only the direct consequences of a proposed course; the good economist looks at the longer and indirect consequences."  It is wise to keep this in mind when reviewing the legislations proposed by those in Washington which would affect our economy.  As for this current situation, let's look at what we ought to do. Bail out these failures? Or artificially prop them up?  Think about it: What happens if we don't bail out these companies? Who suffers? Mainly, the billionaire investors who put money into these companies, and the big banks that backed them will suffer too; hopefully they will fail  Few people are foolish enough to justify to themselves that robbing the poor and middle class to help out Investment Bankers is a just cause. (Honestly, if anyone can do that with all sincerity, they are beyond reach, repellent to reason.) So, I think it fair to dismiss these "victims."  Who else? The people who invest in them. In the case of AIG, all those will suffer whose 401k plans were covered by AIG.  Well, OK. Sure, these people could have just had a more reliable carrier of insurance; they could have followed the workings of AIG more closely; they could have done many other things. But let's just say that we think we ought to bail out these companies - not to help the companies, but simply to help those who are hurt by the company's downfall. How would we go about doing that?  Taxes won't be raised to cover that $700 billion. No politician would ever dare to do that.   We won't borrow $700 billion. China, the chief purchaser of American crap, will have no part in this, and neither will any other country that may have the ability to borrow to us.  Does the government reach into the "trust funds" that are Social Security and the FDIC? Nope; there's nothing but an IOU from Uncle Sam in these supposed "trust funds."  How else can we possibly get the money? No one, US taxpayer or foreign government, will give us the money. Well, I guess we could just turn on the printing presses and pump out $700 billion, right?  And, of course, this nonsensical scheme is what will be done.  The Federal Reserve will work their magic and create the money out of thin air. The main result out of creating more money is the devaluation of the money currently in existence. The wallets of every person in America grow thinner.  So we see that the price for bailing out these companies is the impoverishment of all those who hold dollars. In other words, we can only help those few people who were hurt by AIG's failure by bringing poverty to all, lower USA's GDP, and lowering the standard of living. Every single person in this country will suffer due to dollar devaluation. The savings of every person will go down in order to save the few on Wall Street.  Investor Jim Rogers was exactly right when he described this bailout as "welfare for the rich," He went on to say, "[t]his is socialism for the rich. It's bailing out the financiers, the banks, the Wall Streeters." He also said that, "America is more communist than China is right now."&amp;nbsp;  Ron Paul is one of the very few politicians who see this situation clearly: "$700 billion tied up in illiquid assets is $700 billion that is not put to productive use. That amount of money in the private sector could be used to research new technologies, start small business that create thousands of jobs, or upgrade vital infrastructure. Instead, that money will be siphoned off into unproductive assets which may burden the government for years to come. The great French economist Frederic Bastiat is famous for explaining the difference between what is seen and what is unseen. In this case the bailout's proponents see the alleged benefits, while they fail to see the jobs, businesses, and technologies not created due to this utter waste of money."  Not even the normally easily duped American people like this bailout. As one informed citizen put it:    "So the plan is for the government to buy a whole bunch of garbage that the sellers don't want to sell at a market price, hold on to this rotten junk while pumping more money into the economy to try and re-inflate the bubble, and sell them back at a 'profit' (as if the government is a productive business)? Oh yeah, and there's going to be help for the 'little guy' and lord only knows what else stuffed into this bill. And sane people are supposed to believe that creating the amount of money required to attempt this will not cause any problems? It's little consolation, but it seems Ron Paul is poised for the greatest 'I told you so' in US political history."   There are countless times throughout Ron Paul's political career in which he warned those who instituted reckless policies of the consequences that lay ahead. (For example, here he is calling for an end to subsidies to Fannie and Freddie because it would lead to malinvestment and a collapse in the housing market.) However, in focusing on the here-and-now rather than the long-term effects, most other politicians ignored Paul's advice. In times such as these, perhaps it would be wise to look to those who have been right all along:  "The issue boils down to this: do we care about freedom? Do we care about responsibility and accountability? Do we care that our government and media have been bought and paid for? Do we care that average Americans are about to be looted in order to subsidize the fattest of cats on Wall Street and in government? Do we care?  When the chips are down, will we stand up and fight, even if it means standing up against every stripe of fashionable opinion in politics and the media?  Times like these have a way of telling us what kind of a people we are, and what kind of country we shall be."
