man our stock markets are rigged like the casinos Aig the world largest insurance company they stock blows up and is ticking a spiral downward trend on top of freddie mac, and off course lehman brothers took the cake while express wants to do a 10 to one reverse split, I see i would make a good finacial advisor lol no i bought most of the after they crashed to see what chunks were left,,, but it reminded me of 1987 when the markets crashed and me and my exwife had to rush out and buy walmart stock,, lol i dunno what happend to that,, but in 87 they didnt have online tradeing you had to go to a broker house and buy,,, i like this much better as i can sit in my boxers all day and buy and sell never looseing the original principal...
