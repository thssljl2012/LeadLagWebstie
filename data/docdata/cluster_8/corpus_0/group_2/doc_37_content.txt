Two thirds of Finsec members at the bank voted in the ballot, and seventy seven percent of those who participated voted to accept the offer. However, Finsec members took the opportunity of the unpaid stopwork meetings on Friday 22 August to send a strong message to the bank that they expect more. Major pickets occurred in Auckland, Rotorua and Wellington and various activities took place in other centres. Finsec Union Council Chair Cathie Lendrum said that while the outcome of the negotiations was disappointing, that there had been some significant achievements and there was much more to do as a union. In the last 12 months Finsec members collectively negotiated the highest average wage increases out of any industry group in New Zealand. We are committed to achievingchanges to targets and improving staffing levels, and have the support of bank customers to continue our campaign to make ANZ National a Better Bank.
