As I have gotten closer to graduating, I have been thinking alot more about my future. I am going to be graduating at a time when the economy is in a recession and the job market sucks. And to be honest with you this scares the crap out of me. I would like use another word but you never know my future employer might read this. Seriously, though have you stopped to think about things like that. Wall Street is in turmoil, Merrill Lynch has been bought out by Bank Of America, Lehman Brothers went under, and AIG was helped out by the government, and the then you have Freddie Mac and Fannie May that had to be taken over by the goverment. In my opinion, it makes you stop and think about how our nation has become this way. And to be honest with you credit card companies are going to start making there money by charging higher late fees and higher fees if you go over your limit. So, to end this here is my opinion I think banks made it too easy for people to get loans and credit card companies did the same as well. So, spend wisely and think wisely about your purchases and don't forget to stimulate the economy.
