     No time to post somethin' fancy, so here are the'toids you need, from a source you trust.  The most effectivepolitical ad in the current U.S. presidential campaign deals with aerial wolf gunning.  Some unlucky person at the KFW (Germany's state-owned &amp;quot;Credit Institute for Reconstruction&amp;quot;) transferred up to 350 million Euro (g) to Lehman Brothers last Monday, the day LB declared bankruptcy. D'oh!  Two guys I've never heard of describe the current U.S. credit crisis brilliantly here.  Since I'm an American taxpayer, and the American taxpayer now owns AIG Insurance, and AIG Insurance owns Manchester United football team, I suppose I now own about .000001% of Man U.  Wilco's most recent record, Sky Blue Sky, is magnificent.   UPDATE: Commenter Ingo points out that the Wilco link was broken. Thank, I fixed it. He also points out that the record has been out for a year now. To which I say: did I saw it new? No, I called it 'most recent', not 'recent.' And lay off me, already! This blogdoes not appearon vellum, bound in calfskin, edited by a panel of distinguished scholars. It's a fecking hobby. And besides, I ain't chargin' you people ONE THIN DIME for this, so if you don't like my humble efforts, Ingo, why don't you start your own goddamn... Excuse me, it's been a rough day. I didn't mean to get all cranky.Have a nice weekend!
