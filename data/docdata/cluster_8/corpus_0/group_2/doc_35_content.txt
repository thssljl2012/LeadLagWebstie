 I just want a day where I can say 'Yknow what world, I'm alright.'I can't stop boozing. You know you've got a problem when you're pissed up and you forget if you've put your baby to bed or not. I really am the scum of the earth.&amp;nbsp; And you also know you've got a problem when you open your fridge and all there is a tub of very questionable margarine, 5 bottles of wine, 2 large bottles of strongbow, 3 cans of double dutch and an empty milk carton. By the time I'm 25 I'll be a full blown alcoholic with no teeth, a red nose and a child in a care.I really wish I was exaggerating. In other news I bought a Dead Kennedys and Sonic Youth tshirt today. I'm sick of rubbish shops in Leeds, I practically was on the bones of my arse looking for them tshirts today. I'd use the internet but because no banks trust me whatsoever, I'm not allowed to. What am I actually going to do with a debit card though? I can't even think of anything witty to say about that because it's absurb. I'm only allowed a cash card which I'm pretty sure is designed for kids under 12. It's gone on for too long now, all I want is a fucking visa electron or solo card. It is not much to ask for. Fuck you, Barclays. Fuck you Halifax. Fuck you, Natwest. I know there's other banks, but I'd be here all day handing out fuck yous.Last but not least... Why is it whenever you wash up, regardless of how much feeling around of the bowl you do, when you pour the water out there's GUARANTEED to be a teaspoon left? Every single time.Yknow what world, I'm alright.
