This is a quote from my October 27th issue of The Nation that John McCain said right before Wall Street collapsed:"Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation."Boy he must really be regretting that statement.
