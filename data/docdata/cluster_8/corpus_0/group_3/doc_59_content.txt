Execs getting the cush treatment on bailout money?  I am shocked. Just shocked, I tell you.Dear Friend,Two weeks ago, Treasury Secretary Paulson bailed out American Insurance Group (AIG) with $85 billion dollars in taxpayer money - and now they are back for more. He said they needed it to stay afloat. Now, we know what they did with our money.AIG executives headed out on a taxpayer funded junket to the St. Regis resort in California. While there, they had a blast at our expense. They helped themselves to:1    * $201,047.42 for hotel rooms and $147,301.71 for catered banquets    * $23,380 for the hotel spa and another $1,488 for the salon.    * Golf for $6,939.09 and $5,016.32 spent at the Tavern.Join me in sending this message to Secretary Paulson:"The Director who authorized this junket should be fired and every penny spent on this lavish retreat must be returned to the Treasury."http://act.truemajorityaction.org/p/7002/campaign?campaign_KEY=1553From TrueMajority.org, if it weren't clear.Sure, we're only talking a third of a million or so, but hey, a million here and a million there and pretty soon we're talking real money.So, next time you're looking at your pay stub and checking out the money withheld for federal taxes, you can smile and know that some of it went to a good cause - helping a bunch of irresponsible rich folks chill at St. Regis resort.Oh, wait, we're running a deficit and in debt - I guess it'll be your pay stub in 10 years that'll be paying for this and the interest on it.Just remember, if the next president does have to raise taxes and gets called on being a "tax and spend" politician, the taxing might be right, but a lot of that spending will have been done before they ever get into office.
