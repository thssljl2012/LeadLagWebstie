Those creeps on Wall street continue to take care of their own on a scale that can only be matched in Washington. Recently, the Lehman Brothers CEO (Fuld) was questioned by the Chairman of the House Oversight Committee (earning points for a job well done, by me) and had this to say:                                                                                                                                                                         It was a showdown to cherish for critics of Wall Streets culture of enrichment. The grim-faced boss of the bankrupt bank Lehman Brothers was left squirming yesterday as a veteran Democrat roasted him over his multimillion-dollar pay. With the startled look of a man unaccustomed to sharp examination, Lehman chief executive Richard Fuld clashed bluntly with the chairman of the House oversight committee, Henry Waxman, on Capitol Hill. Your company is now bankrupt and our country is in a state of crisis, said Waxman, a liberal from California. You get to keep $480m. I have a very basic question: Is that fair? After a long pause, Fuld said the figure was exaggerated: The majority of my compensation, sir, came in stock. The vast majority of the stock I got I still owned at the point of our [bankruptcy] filing. Waxman cut him off, saying that even if the figure was slightly lower, it was unimaginable to much of the public. Is that fair, for a CEO of a company thats now bankrupt, to make that kind of money? Its just unimaginable to so many people. I would say to you the $500m number is not accurate, said Fuld. Id say to you, although its still a large number, for the years youre talking about here, my cash compensation was close to $60m, which youve indicated here, and I took out closer to $250m [in shares]. Interrupting again, Waxman listed Fulds collection of property, including a $14m ocean-front villa in Florida and a home in an exclusive ski resort. Wait! There is more! Less than a week after the bailout, AIG execs throw a $440,000 dollar party for themselves! I can honestly say that I hate these people. They exemplify the excess that foreigners hate us for. Withthe good-ol-boy networkin place to such adegree as this, I think that it is perfectly warrented. Think of allthe good that OUR money could have done! Details: Imagine watching the international company you run fall apart. Now imagine youve got to work double time to keep the company from destroying the global economy because youve involved your company in many businesses around the world. Everyday you wake up and the newspaper is hammering your boneheaded decisions. Meanwhile CNBC has ten people on the screen at once talking about your failures. Finally, you go hat in hand to the government who reluctantly gives you the money you need to protect the world against the mess you made. Ugh, feels stressful just thinking about it. Afterwards, you probably want Me time to recuperate, correct? Okay, good. Now that youve been through what the AIG execs have been through, we hope you wont judge them too harshly: ABC: Less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, Congressional investigators revealed today. AIG documents obtained by Waxmans investigators show the company paid more than $440,000 for the retreat, including nearly $200,000 for rooms, $150,000 for meals and $23,000 in spa charges. Less than one week after the taxpayers rescued AIG, company executives could be found wining and dining at one of the most exclusive resorts in the nation, said Waxman as he prepared to question AIG executives.  Would someone please make sure that EVERY SINGLE ONE of those peoplegets sent to federal pound me in the ass prison? That would be justice.
