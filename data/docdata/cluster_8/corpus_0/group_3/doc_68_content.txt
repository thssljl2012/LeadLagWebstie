The money circled in red, would not have been there without the transaction in blue.  I like how it occured first, though.  Makes sense.  Yes, Bank of America, I know my automatic savings transfer would have been cancelled due to a low account balance this week (see half-transaction at top)... but how can my money fucking BILOCATE?!?!  So you can extract a fee, that's right.Turning the anger inward... with our without that garbledy mess, I have put my account in the red again.  Ka ching, I am awesome.*sigh*--Caitlin--PS - I should really stop nickel-and-diming myself at le Publix, no?
