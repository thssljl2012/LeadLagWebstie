 This socialist bailout bill was the wrong thing to do. That's why I will not support any candidate that voted for this turkey. Take AIG Insurance for an example:  CHARLOTTE, N.C. &amp;#8212; First there was the $440,000 American Insurance Group Inc. spent entertaining executives days after receiving an $85 billion lifeline from the Federal Reserve, now it's $86,000 for a hunting trip in England as the faltering company reaped another $37.8 billion in taxpayer funded loans.  IS ANYBODY ELSE AS PISSED OFF AS I AM?  I want that fuckin' money back, all of it, all 122.8 billion dollars. I don't give a shit if AIG goes under, in fact, I hope they do. I want heads to roll, people jailed, and all of them sued. I want all those people totally destroyed. How dare those assholes!  I can't write anymore about this. I'm so fuckin' angry I'm damned near beside myself. Fuck AIG, let the son of a bitch go under. Piss on 'em all.
