               If Bubbe and Zayde are still thinking about voting for McCain, maybe they need to read this article from today's Wall Street Journal, where McCain's top economic advisor, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, says McCain will pay for his health care plan with deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid.  McCain's overall plan, of course, repeals the deduction businesses currently have to provide health insurance to their employees--which will lead to millions of employees losing their employer-based health insurance--and then sends the employees into the private plan market, where insurance companies can and do refuse to cover "pre-existing" conditions.  And as Joe Biden made clear at last Thursday's debate, the $5,000 tax credit McCain proposes for those employee-taxpayers will not cover the health insurance premium costs they are currently receiving as a benefit of employment.McCain's health care plan cannot be more pro-insurance company nor worse for American workers and their families.  McCain himself could not have put it better in one of the great ironic statements ever uttered by a politician (see here for link):Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.Well, Senator McCain, we know how that worked out...Bottom line:  All seniors who rely upon Medicare should be supporting Obama.  Period.(Edited)ADDENDUM:  Krugman nails the same issue here.
