Here is a bit more for you from P4P&amp;#8230; LISTEN: All Is Well [mp3-audio]  (6:43) READ: (440 words; just under 2 minutes to read)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  As news and newspapers continue to focus on all the bank failures and the subprime crisis, now, what are even being called &amp;#8220;insurance company failures,&amp;#8221; we want to let you know that all is well. And the concern that you&amp;#8217;re naturally are going to have about the financial safety and security of your money is valid, so we want to make sure that we&amp;#8217;re addressing it and making sure that your thinking is where it needs to be.  You&amp;#8217;ll recall that our very first Principle of Prosperity is about your thinking and to make sure that you&amp;#8217;re not falling prey to all of the press and what is going on in the financial markets, because your thinking has a big part to do that.  Interestingly enough, even Susie Orman is now recommending whole life insurance. As shocked as we were to see it - and of course she has it with a caveat, saying &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t usually recommend whole life insurance&amp;#8221; - she will even admits that it is now a very appropriate place to store cash and have the safety and security that one would be seeking. And she actually recommended that someone purchase it in a Costco article, of all places, for a particular situation where they were going to desire that the death benefit be sure to be paid.  So the insurance companies that we represent are solid, &amp;#8216;been around forever&amp;#8217; insurance companies. They&amp;#8217;re not large conglomerates like AIG. AIG had an insurance company affiliated with them, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t the bulk of their investments, and it was not the bulk of their problems. AIG&amp;#8217;s insurance company would have done just fine have it been left alone, but it got sucked in, with all the problems that AIG was having - and those were primarily by investing in the subprime environment with mortgages. The insurance companies that our clients have have a very, very small percentage, if any at all, of their money invested in subprime environments. So you can rest assured that the money that you have and the cash value of your life insurance is safe. The death benefits that you expect to be paid many, many, many years from now will be paid. And if this is an area of concern for you, please get a hold of us - shoot us an e-mail, or give us a call - and we&amp;#8217;ll be happy to go over them with you, in particular, your specific company and exactly what&amp;#8217;s going on. We look forward to continue to help you with your thinking to get us all past the challenges that are being expressed today in the press.
