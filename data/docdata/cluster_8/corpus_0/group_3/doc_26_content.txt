They cry foul: &amp;quot;it's your home insurance! It's these old folks life insurance!&amp;nbsp; It's their 401Ks, your IRAs !&amp;quot; blah blah blah.... by the time, these old folks' life insurance is up for payment, there won't be any of that bail-out money left, because the policies that are up for payment now are... insurance on Lehman bonds and other crappy high-risk paper. So, yeah. 401Ks and IRAs - maybe, but if you were close to retirement age, most of your IRA should have been in money market and low risk papers, not in high-risk bonds. And doubtly many of those who have IRAs ever knew about bond insurance at all. But who did know about bond insurance?&amp;nbsp;Ta-da! It was Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merril Lynch. Yikes!
