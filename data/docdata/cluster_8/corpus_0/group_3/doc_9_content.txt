Filed under: SportsABC News reports that AIG, the troubled insurance company that has taken a lot of heat for their spending, will still be shelling out the big bucks for a luxury suite at Madison Square Garden. The company bought a a club suite for their brokers and clients back in February and will be responsible for the year-long contract. The suites generally cost between $225,000 and $500,000. AIG will have to pay for the suite but does not plan to use it. They are also canceling more of the luxurious conferences and events like the one held at the St. Regis Monarch Beach which inspired nationwide outrage. No word yet on whether the suite will simply remain vacant. I'd love to see it donated so that kids who might never otherwise see an event in Madison Square Garden could have a grand experience. They'd likely appreciate it a lot more than some bored executives.&amp;nbsp;Read&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Permalink&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Email this&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Linking&amp;nbsp;Blogs&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Comments
