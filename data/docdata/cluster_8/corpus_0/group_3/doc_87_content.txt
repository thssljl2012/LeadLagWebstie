I pledge allegiance to Goldman Sachs, and to the conspiracy for which it stands, one racket under Paulson, Communist and indivisible, with eviction and poverty for all.&amp;nbsp; The battle of the bailout is over.&amp;nbsp; We lost.&amp;nbsp; Despite the unprecedented opposition, despite everything we did, I doubt that many of my readers thought we could win.&amp;nbsp; Now we need to analyze what happened, what it means and, most important, where it could take us.&amp;nbsp; We do have some hints.  First, consider that the people of this country have never before expressed such rage, such antipathy to a bill.&amp;nbsp; According to one report, the people were 300 to one against it.&amp;nbsp; One Member of Congress received 15,000 messages about it. Ten were in favor.&amp;nbsp; Another said 95% of the messages he got were opposed. According to one analyst, Ryan Pollack, "the calls to Congress&amp;nbsp;were 50 percent 'No' and 50 percent 'Hell, No.'"  There has not been anything like it in the history of the country.&amp;nbsp; So, the fact that Congress could impose this financial version of the Dresden firebombing of&amp;nbsp;World War II by the Allied forces&amp;nbsp;in the face of such historic voter opposition.&amp;nbsp; IS the fact that Congress could in effect spit in your face, pass it,&amp;nbsp; proof that representative government in the country is gone.&amp;nbsp; The vote in Congress expressed the fact that we have government by coup, that the actual purpose of "representation" in Washington is to conceal its absence.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Most people now see that and if they do not, well then pity is what I hold for their ever incessiant blindness. Second, consider the nature of the opposition.&amp;nbsp; Many bills have faced enormous opposition in Congress, yes.&amp;nbsp; The opposition, however large, came from the group(s) the bill targeted.&amp;nbsp; Here the opposition came from every identifiable group, racial, financial, cultural, sexual, geographical, etc.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, like a natural disaster that cares nothing for the politics of the victims in its path, it left jungled allegiances and loyalties like piles of wrecked furnishings behind.  Along these lines, both Senator B. Hussein Obama and el Senador' Juan McCain voted for the coup. Why?&amp;nbsp; Here are the top ten corporate PAC contributors to both candidates:  Communist Presidential&amp;nbsp;Candidate A  Goldman Sachs $739,521 UBS AG $419,550 Lehman Brothers $391,774 Citigroup Inc $492,548 Morgan Stanley $341,380 Latham &amp;amp; Watkins $328,879 Google Inc $487,355 JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co $475,112 Sidley Austin LLP $370,916 Skadden, Arps et al $360,409  Communist Presidential Candidate B  Merrill Lynch $379,170 Citigroup Inc. $287,801 Morgan Stanley $249,377 Wachovia Corp. $147,456 Goldman Sachs $220,045 Lehman Brothers $115,707 Bear Stearns $108,000 JPMorgan Chase $206,392 Bank of America $133,975 Credit Suisse $175,503  Yes, I know that by now my regular readers are long since familiar with my tricks, so I admit this is another.&amp;nbsp; Notice that both Communist candidates are properties of the financial beneficiaries of the coup.&amp;nbsp; They both belong to Goldman Sachs, one of them even more so.&amp;nbsp; Which one is that? Paulson sent $739,521 to Senator Hussein, who wouldn't pick his nose unless Hank approved.&amp;nbsp; What was that you said about "change?"&amp;nbsp; I seriously cringe everytime that charlatan from Kenya even speaks the word.&amp;nbsp; And (Juan) McCain is certainly no better although the financial thieves have paid Obama much more. Senator Chris Dodd led the coup in the Senate.&amp;nbsp; Congressman Barney Frank led it through the House.&amp;nbsp; Both of these men, especially Dodd recieved enormous amounts of money to champion the banking thieves agendas for years as ranking members on the banking committees in Congress.&amp;nbsp; Barney is one of many of our esteemed sodomists in Washington.&amp;nbsp; For years, the butt he jumped belonged to Herb Moses, a top official at Fannie Mae.&amp;nbsp; Was that why Barney kept saying Fannie was fine? &amp;nbsp;Barney was as "surprised" as anyone when the&amp;nbsp;shit hit the fan.&amp;nbsp; Both Barney and Chris are supported royally by Wall Street.  The fact that the opposition was so vast and so varied means that millions who knew nothing now know a lot more.&amp;nbsp; What do they know?&amp;nbsp; For the first time, they understand that the Constitution is dead, exactly as late Republican Congressman Henry Hyde and&amp;nbsp;King George Bush Jr.&amp;nbsp;have&amp;nbsp;attempted&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;show us repeatedly recently.  The Federal Reserve has been illegal from the instant it was enacted, because the Act gives the money power to the Fed.&amp;nbsp; The Constitution, the law!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Gives the money power exclusively to Congress and Congress lacks the power to give away its power which it did anyway in 1913 with the Federal Reserve Act.&amp;nbsp; The coup compounds the original crime and makes it worse.&amp;nbsp; Congress has no power to do what it did.&amp;nbsp; This is what Congressman Ron Paul has been saying for years upon years now.&amp;nbsp; Now do you see what he was talking about?&amp;nbsp; The only real solution is to abolish the Fed.&amp;nbsp; NOW. A corollary of that realization is that crime does pay if it is big enough.&amp;nbsp; That is what you should now be teaching your kids.&amp;nbsp; Sure, holding up a Seven Eleven is risky and stupid.&amp;nbsp; To get into the really big money safely go into the rackets such as&amp;nbsp;politics or banking.&amp;nbsp; There is no more law.&amp;nbsp; You know something is right, if you can get away with it.&amp;nbsp; If you can't, it's wrong.  Now go back to Congressman Brad Sherman.&amp;nbsp; Remember that&amp;nbsp;Sherman is no kind of "right wing extremist."&amp;nbsp; He certainly is not a Republican.&amp;nbsp; Liberal Democrat Sherman says that during the confrontation about the coup in the House, "a few members were even told there would be Martial Law in America if we voted no."&amp;nbsp; That's right, this is what Brad Sherman says Nancy Pelosi threatened with if the bill did not pass.&amp;nbsp; Did I mention Nancy Pelosi's husband had over 150,000 shares invested in one of these failing bailed out companies?&amp;nbsp; That Nancy has recieved hundreds of thousands of dollars in her election campaigns from these criminals? What is martial law? &amp;nbsp;It is military rule by decree.&amp;nbsp; No more wasting time with votes, no more stupid voting for the wrong thing. &amp;nbsp;Meanwhile, the Army acknowledges that the Northern Command may call upon the 3rd Infantry Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team to help with civil unrest and crowd control. &amp;nbsp;In the horrifying wake of martial law in the South after Lincoln's Communist War to Destroy the Union, Congress forbade it in the posse comitatus law and then repealed it under pressure from President Bush.&amp;nbsp; So in otherwords, in case the American Citizens smell bullshit, become enraged and wish to hang these thieves and tratiors a division of US troops is what we can expect walking down our streets of beautiful suberbia. Put all that together with the Halliburton concentration camps, completed, equipped, fully staffed, but empty, waiting for millions to concentrate.&amp;nbsp; Who? Probably not illegal aliens, because they are not there.&amp;nbsp; So, if you subtract illegal aliens, you have citizens.&amp;nbsp; Are they the target of the camps?&amp;nbsp; Are they destined to be concentrated?&amp;nbsp; What could we logically expect?  This is what I fear, not what I want. I don't have delusions of negative grandeur concurring in my dome.&amp;nbsp; I don't take solace in what I know is about to happen, I'm not rejoicing and predicting Jesus will be back to save the day.&amp;nbsp; I'm just merely a messanger.&amp;nbsp; The coup is not a solution.&amp;nbsp; The fiscal disaster will get worse.&amp;nbsp; As I write, the collapse intensifies.&amp;nbsp; Shortages, crime and chaos will erupt.&amp;nbsp; Pressure to concentrate for our "protection" will intensify.&amp;nbsp; Again, among our population of 300 millions there are millions newly awakened sheep,&amp;nbsp;some of them would decline to be concentrated, decline violently.&amp;nbsp; How many?&amp;nbsp; I don't know.&amp;nbsp; A very small percentage.&amp;nbsp; Would you believe maybe one percent?&amp;nbsp; Five percent?&amp;nbsp; Ten? &amp;nbsp;Yes, but one percent of 300 million is three million and so on and so forth. Three million!&amp;nbsp; Against whom?&amp;nbsp; A heavily armed technologically advanced professional military?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; These people are starting to realize who the enemy is, and the farther they did, the heavier Pelosi will push for Martial law to be decreed.&amp;nbsp; I worry about the future.&amp;nbsp; I am perfectly aware that the conspiracy for world government, which has nationalized our police, wants a confrontation it can use as an excuse for suppression.&amp;nbsp; That is precisely why I do not, why I always avoid confrontation.&amp;nbsp; But the martial law advocates have put everything they need for the purpose in place.&amp;nbsp; They didn't do so for practice.&amp;nbsp; The fact that Brad Sherman and many others like him are talking like this for the first time apparently means the conspirators intend to go all the way.&amp;nbsp; Martial law is all over the internet. At some point&amp;nbsp;push will meet&amp;nbsp;shove.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I do know you are not talking about unarmed, ignorant villagers sitting on their haunches beside a polluted stream with flies on their eyes.&amp;nbsp; You are talking about millions of the best of the best, guys who can shoot the wings off a gnat at a gazillion yards.&amp;nbsp; You are talking about the deadliest creature that every stalked the earth, the Marine Corps sniper.&amp;nbsp; Yes, he's retired and a tad thicker in the middle, but he is still deadly and just as mean.  And just in case you think this whole thing is a joke just before I started writing this I saw an article on the net that &amp;nbsp;a disgruntled employee has knocked former Lehman Brothers CEO Richard Fuld cold in the Lehman gym. &amp;nbsp;Fuld left his job with the usual multimillions.&amp;nbsp; Banking and politics, what great rackets!&amp;nbsp; The more you fail, the bigger your re...
