I have been forced to escalate my problems with Barclays Bank into a formal complaint because I have still not received a closing statement for my late Mother's account.In March 2008  I was promised a statement would be sent in July 2008. No statement was received.In August 2008  I was promised a statement would follow under separate cover. No statement was received.In September 2008  a supervisor promised to post me the statement the same day. No statement was received.
