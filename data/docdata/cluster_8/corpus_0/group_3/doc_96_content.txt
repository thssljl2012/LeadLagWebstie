           Hurricane Ike continues to have it's way with me....We got a call Saturday night from the insurance adjuster.  They have to e-mail us some paperwork to fill out, ok we tell them, we'll be watching for the paperwork.So, here we are 5 days later, no paperwork.  So I call the adjuster firm, Quality Assurance Adjusting, LLC.  They can't help me, I have to call the adjuster directly.  So, I call the adjuster directly, she hangs up on me the first time the phone rings, then lets it go to voice mail the second time I call.  Great, left a message.In the meantime, I take a closer look at my papwerwork from the Texas Wind Storm Insurance Association, and I realize that even though my e-mail address is supposed to match my name, the genius that took my information managed to misspell my name.  So I call them.  They can't help me, they don't keep records of the claims after they are filed.  WTF?  How the hell do you not keep records of insurance claims at a state agency when you are paying out hundreds of millions of dollars?So, back to calling Quality Assurance Adjusting, LLC.  The woman on the phone said she wouldn't change it on her "Screen" as it is a PDF, and my adjuster Jenny Finch wouldn't see it on her "Screen".  No shit.I've given up on contacting Nationwide Insurance on this issue, they've been less than worthless throughout the entire process of making a claim.Labels: bad support, hurricane, ike, nationwode, Quality Assurance LLC, TWIA
