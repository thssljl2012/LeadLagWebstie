How come a government can save a Bank or an Insurance Company (AIG) they can not save a car company - my view is either you are a socialist country or you are not.  Should not muck about saving some businesses but not others.  Personally I would not save businesses - this is the only discipline that stops the Banks mucking up, but hey what do I know.
