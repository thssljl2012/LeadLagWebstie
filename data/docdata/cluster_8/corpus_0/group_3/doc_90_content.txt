&amp;nbsp; I listened to most of the presidental debate tonight.&amp;nbsp; Out of the gate, I was hard pressed to find a difference between McCain and Obama. &amp;nbsp; They both want unprecedented government intervention to solve the current economic "crisis".&amp;nbsp; The fact of the matter is that this is a crisis that originated in Wall Street, and must be delt with as such. &amp;nbsp; The CEO's of AIG, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Wachovia, and Bank of America should be fired immediately. &amp;nbsp; This entire "crisis" has come about from the situation that virtually everyone, from small business to individuals to big corporations were spending more money than they had, and thus, now need someone to bail them out since their assets are so screwed up that no one in the private market will want to purchase them. &amp;nbsp; In layman's terms, you bought an Escalade two years ago for $60K and it is now worth, say, &amp;nbsp;$18K.&amp;nbsp; You owe $30K on this vehicle and&amp;nbsp;the loan is&amp;nbsp;now what is commonly termed, "upside down".&amp;nbsp; You realize that you cannot afford this loan that you should not have been given in the first place, you default on the loan. &amp;nbsp; GMAC is now on the hook for an asset that is worth $18K that $30K is owed on.&amp;nbsp; Today GM stock closed at $7.56/share or down $-0.92 from the market downturn yesterday.&amp;nbsp; Hopefully my 100,000 mile warranty will hold out until my car is paid off. &amp;nbsp; Bottom line, as a society we, in the past few years, borrowed more than we could afford to pay back.&amp;nbsp; From the marginal credit risk to WalMart, we ALL borrowed more than we KNEW we could pay back. &amp;nbsp; The difference between people of the working class and the elites is that we realize that we should not have borrowed more than&amp;nbsp;we were willing (or able) to pay back.&amp;nbsp; The elites are the ones who wish to sustain the status-quo.&amp;nbsp; The status-quo is WRONG. &amp;nbsp; Merhar for President 2022! -AVM
