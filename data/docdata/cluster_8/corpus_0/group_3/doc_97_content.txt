  Some five million fraudulent home mortgages are in the hands of illegal aliens, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.Of course 5 million fraudulent mortgages held by illegal aliens didn't help lead us to the credit crisis.Of course American taxpayers SHOULD be on the hook for bailing out illegal aliens who are holding fraudulent loans.I do remember when Bank of America made the big push to market their credit cards to the illegal alien community.

When asked what HUD says the correct number is, the person (who identified himself only as 'Brian' and who refused to give his last name), either would not or could not say how many illegal immigrants hold mortgages.  He also said there was "no way" HUD would grant an interview on the subject.  Read more ...   Summary only ...    ...
