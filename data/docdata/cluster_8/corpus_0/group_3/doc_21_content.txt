                  All together now...A British bank is run with precisionA British home requires nothing less!Tradition, discipline, and rules must be the toolsWithout them - disorder! Chaos!Moral disintegration!In short, we have a ghastly mess!I quite agree!Whoever scheduled Mary Poppins on ITV3 this Sunday afternoon has both a wiley sense of humour and the kind of foresight much needed in the financial sector at the moment...Give me back my money!Labels: it's the end of the world as we know it (and I feel fine), lyrics, tv
