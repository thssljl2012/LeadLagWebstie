Elizabeth Dole Thank you, Elizabeth Dole, for helping make up my mind! I know it has been a terrible fight to keep your seat in the senate away from Kay Hagan. With all the negative ads showing on the television, I was very confused concerning my vote, but you have shown me the light! Tonight I had to pay the bills. Mixed in with my Bank of America credit cards and checking account statement I found not one, not two, but three of your attack ads targeting Kay Hagan. You said that she was for environmental protection and taxes on oil company profits. Can you believe her? Why, the nerve! The sheer cheek! I made up my mind right there after seeing number two. You didn&amp;#8217;t have to send me that third mailing, but it did reinforce my decision. Kay Hagan And my decision is to vote for Kay Hagan! That&amp;#8217;s right, we need change in Washington! I want an environmental in congress representing our grand state. Additional taxes on oil company profits also sounds like a good platform to vote for after having to pay $4.00 and more a gallon for so long. I was born in 1977, but I like former President Jimmy Carter too, so thanks for trying to connect Kay Hagan to a great President with good ideas. So, say hello to your husband Bob for me. I rather liked him when he ran for president, but I&amp;#8217;m not sorry that Bill Clinton won that election. Here&amp;#8217;s to your retirement!
