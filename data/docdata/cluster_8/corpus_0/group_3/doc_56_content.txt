In the Wall St. Journal,, Peter J. Wallison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, argues that Senator Obama voted Present on mortgage reform when it counted: In each of the first two presidential debates, Barack Obama claimed that &amp;#8220;Republican deregulation&amp;#8221; is responsible for the financial crisis.

The GLBA&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;repeal&amp;#8221; of a portion of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 is said to have somehow contributed to the current financial meltdown.  Nonsense. Adopted early in the New Deal, the Glass-Steagall Act separated investment and commercial banking.
