G. W. Bush's Administration is the antithesis of "Republican," it is collectivist in the worst Soviet sense. Even the more socialist New York Times finds words difficult to describe what Treasury Secretary and Federal Reserve Chief are hoisting:The governments plan is an exceptional step, but not an unprecedented one.Do you feel warmer and cozy inside, as your federal government nationalizes insurance companies and commercial banks. Now you can profess your socialist government has made you a stockholder in banks and AIG Insurance, and whatever else Paulsen and Bernanke can sell us.What? You don't feel like a shareholder? That's why socialism is called serfdom. You are a slave to the state, the state insists you are the owner, and you are quite sure you are nothing of the kind. Owners usually have a say in their property. What's your say, you ask? Why ask? Are you even being heard by your CEO Paulsen and Bush?Perhaps your proxies are answered by prayers of G. W. Bush's as god's prophet that allows you a say. Nothing more, lots less. Enjoy being screwed.
