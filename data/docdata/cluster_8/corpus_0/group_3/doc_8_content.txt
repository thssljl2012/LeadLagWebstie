southtwelfth:   Back in September, when the market was starting to melt down and I found myself baffled by the press coverage, stymied by my C- in Macroeconomicsand failing to grasp the exact nature of the problems, I wrote an email to my dad in Louisville, asking if he could lay it out for me in concise and easy-to-grasp terms.  This is what he wrote: Heres what I think happened. Interest rates were low, and also there was plenty of money to be lent. Homeowners were encouraged to buy houses perhaps larger than they could afford. Perhaps due to adjustable rate mortgages and lenders who offer adjustable rate mortgages were not so conscientious about making good loans. So when interest rates went up, owners began to have trouble. This in itself is not a great problem; thats happened before. However, in the mean time, these mortgages were repackaged as securities. That means that the mortgages were made into financial instruments and shares were sold as if those were stocks. These shares were leveraged by allowing the buyers to buy om margin, i.e. the buyers could pay 3% of the value and repay the rest as the interest came in or the value went up, requiring that housing prices rise and that borrowers repay their loans. So, if you buy at 3% and the loan is paying 6% interest, then you are doubling your money every year. However, if the homeowners default then you dont make anything, and you still have to pay back that 3%  or, you can sell the shares. So many defaulted that housing prices began to fall. Soremember that3%. If housing prices fall more than 3%, then the shares are worth 3% less than you paid, and you owe more than its worth, and you cantsell for what you have in it, and you dont have any of the interest coming in. Youre bankrupt. Lehman Brothers. In the meantime,in order to hedge your bets(you built a hedge around your property so that the foxes cant get in and eat the chickens), the share holders such as LehmanBrothersbought insurance from AIG so that if homeowners defaulted the insurance would pay for the loans. So many defaults killed AIG. Im sure youve heard about the Federal Reserve raising and lowering to affect the economy and youre thinking Why doesnt the federal Reserve just lower interest rates and every bodys happy/ Because of course, thats bullshit. Theres not enough money to be lent have an effect on these loans. Thats where some of the $700,000,000,000.00 comes in. The US govt will buy up these loans and hope the homeowners pay some of it back. Some of them might. So who came out the winners in this? The guy who said I can get such a good price for my house that Ill sell it and use the money to travel around the world He got a great price for his house, traveled, blew half the money on booze and broads and now can come back and buy that same property with the money he has left. So was he smart or just lucky? Dad ____________________________________________________________________  (via mediation)
