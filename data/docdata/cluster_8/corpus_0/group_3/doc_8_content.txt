Here is just an excerpt, or two:Even recently, Mr. McCain advocated, opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking. He repeatedly demonstrates an inability to understand complex issues, and an ignorance of the plight of those who have not enjoyed his financial success....Mr. Obamas efforts to help the middle class, branded socialism by his opponents, show considerable wisdom in light of the current financial mess. Faced with a crisis, the government has had to respond with a flood of cash that increases the income polarization of Americans. Mr. Obamas approach  helping middle class families avoid foreclosures at the front end  would have cost the nation less, helped those who needed it and possibly prevented the crisis entirely.Mr. McCain offers few details on how we would prevent a repeat of our financial calamity, and even fewer on how he would deal with the mounting human and financial costs of the Iraq war. His proposals on health care, according to his own allies, would be disastrous.  (emphasis added)Go read the entire endorsement and pass it around to your fence sitting friends!
