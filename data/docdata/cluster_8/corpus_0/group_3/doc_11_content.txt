         A few days ago, I received a call from a witheld number. Usually I tend not to respond to these sorts (see: telephonophobia), but on this day it was different. On this day, I was expecting a call from an unidentified person regarding the status of my internet line that had suddenly stopped working for no apparent reason. Unless you don't discount the lightning.On a side note, lightnings have become increasingly impudent of late. Gone are the days when they stayed outdoors as they should - now they barge into houses as if they own it, with total disregard for arrestors. One popped into our bath and now Rat is traumatised about showers during thunderstorms.Anyway, that's the reason I answered the call, because part of my life does depend on the internet. Imagine my pleasure then upon hearing the voice of an insurance salesperson. From AIG, no less. [Insert knowing look here]. I know! That was the exact same thing that went through my mind. Weren't they looking for a bail-out a few weeks ago? Well, they couldn't have got much out of it since they were now looking to me for an investment.Here's the thing. I might have considered lending a helping hand, if only the rep didn't immediately launch into the subject of my death. I'm supposed to invest my living days, as the nature of insurances go, only to reap the benefits once I cease to exist. Not much of an incentive there. And I could be wrong, but I'm quite, quite sure Dad would much rather have a thorn in his side me around in person rather than a few hundred thousands representing my soul in currency.I chose to let the sales pitch run its course, then declined it politely at the end and hung up. You can't agree to something you weren't paying attention to, least of all an organization that's barely staying afloat. It could get you into all sorts of trouble. Plus, all that talk about my mortality did not exactly put me in a generous mood.
