Insurers selling individual health plans spend 29 percent of the premiums they receive on administration, largely because they employ so many people to screen applicants. This compares with costs of 12 percent for group plans and just 3 percent for Medicare.[from http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/06/opinion/06krugman.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin]  Oh yeah, and as John McCain said, "Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation." Yep, that worked just swell, John.
