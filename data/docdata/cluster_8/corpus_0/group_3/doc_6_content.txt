I just got my Auto insurance bill the other day. My Auto insurance company is 21st century. Which I was quite happy with. Or at least as happy as one can be with a insurance company. When I opened the bill it said "AIG insurance." I think to my self, "Okay, AIG must have bought out 21st. Oh well, nothing I can do about it." Then the next day I find out that AIG is on the governments watch list as a potential as going under. What the hell kind of joke is that!!!! Evs!!!
