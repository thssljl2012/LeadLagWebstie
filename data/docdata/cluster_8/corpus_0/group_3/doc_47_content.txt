   Amex's Rich Customers? Not So Different From The Rest Of Us   Caroline Waxler   Oct 20, 2008 4:37 PM      Update: Amex Just Reported 24% Earnings Drop For Q3 Earlier: Amex, known for its exclusive cardsCenturion, etc.and letting people charge whatever they want, is seeing a wave of delinquencies. Looks like the party's over! WSJ: Figures released last week show that about 4.1% of AmEx loans were at least 30 days late as of last month, up from 2.5% a year earlier. That's still fewer delinquencies than at other large card issuers, including Bank of America Corp.'s rate of 5.9% in the third quarter.But as the economy weakens, delinquencies and charge-offs are expected by analysts to climb even higher.Seeing trouble on the horizon, American Express earlier this year tightened lending on cards that let people carry a balance from month to month. Now the company is getting even tougher on users of its traditional &amp;quot;charge cards,&amp;quot; which must be paid off every month.For example, AmEx recently slapped a $1,100-a-month spending limit on John and Monica Bell's platinum AmEx charge card. The reason: AmEx customers who pay with plastic at the same places where Mrs. Bell shops and have the same mortgage lender have poor repayment histories, according to a letter sent by AmEx.
