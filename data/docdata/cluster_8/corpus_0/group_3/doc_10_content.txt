(Hat-tip John Bresnhan)The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DDDC), seeing an irresistible opportunity to make big gains on election day, has secured a $15 million loan from Bank of America to spend on tight races toward the finish line.The $15 million nearly doubles what the NRCC was able to borrow recently, and bolsters the enormous financial advantage that Dems already hold over the GOP ($54 million vs. $14.4 million as of August 31st).Yet a loan of this size  the largest ever by any member committee in the House or Senate  represents a gamble by Democrats as well, i.e. theyre going into significant debt betting that they may not see another opportunity like this for years to come.This is an unprecedented field of play out there right now, DCCC Executive Director Brian Wolff said. We could take a $20 million, $30 million loan out, and it would not be enough to seize on the opportunities we have... Wolff projects that there are 25 toss-up races within the margin of error  and that Democrats are currently leading in 21 of them.
