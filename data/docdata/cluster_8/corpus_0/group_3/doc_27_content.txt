 I thought that the open advice, as reported in today issue of the Straits Times, from Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Dr Yaacob Ibrahim with regard to the practice of sound financial planning to be appropriate &amp;amp; timely."I think it is important that we continue to do financial planning, to be judicious of how we use our resources," he said at the Mujahidin Mosque in Queensway yesterday morning after celebrating Hari Raya Puasa with some 1,000 Muslims.To recap his open advice:1) Improve the financial status of your families;2) Do not overspend;3) Think twice before you make purchases, especially big-ticket items;4) Plan your expenditure;5) Do not overburden yourselves with loans;6) Save part of your salary;7) Prioritise your spending;8) Do not stint on your children's education - their future depends on how you as parents plan for them;9) Be patient;10) Practise prudence to prepare for tough times ahead;In the same issue of the Straits Times, particularly the Money Page, I can't help noticing these depressing headlines:"Japanese firms see more gloom.""UBS may cut 1,900 jobs.""US manufacturing activity at 7 year low.""US headed for protracted downturn."Correspondingly, there was an ad by the promoter of a self-proclaimed wealth coach by the name of Mirriam Williams from the United States with the dazzling caption:"How to Trade Safely &amp;amp; Profitably in Volatile &amp;amp; Plunging Markets."followed by credits as follows:in the midst of the twists &amp;amp; turns that shocked the financial world, arising from Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy, Bank of America's take over of Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; the AIG bailout, a group of Smart Traders in Singapore were able to make money from the US stock market.Frankly speaking, I have never been able to get a good grasp of how the stock market actually works, whether in Singapore or elsewhere.All I know very well is that, two of my friends, one a financial whiz-kid &amp;amp; the other a public accountant, were badly burnt during the last Asian financial crisis.The poor accountant friend, who in fact had actually lost all his CPF savings upon retirement plus a two-storey terraced home, almost kill himself, if not for the timely intervention of his wife &amp;amp; family members.I sincerely hope that Singaporeans are alert, &amp;amp; make sure that they do not get carried away by misleading ads.
