Sarah Palin is a living breathing WTF. She cold land as the pick of the week until she falls back into her previous level of obscurity. I can't wait for that to happen. Having said that, let me get to the my pick for this week's wtf moment. You'll love this one given that your helping to foot the bill. Wait for it......BAM!  www.nytimes.com  A week after AIG received an $85 billion federal bailout, its life insurance subsidiary, AIG General, held a weeklong retreat for its top sales agents at the exclusive St. Regis Resort in CA. Expenses for the week, lawmakers were told, totaled $442,000, including $200,000 for hotel rooms, $150,000 for food and $23,000 in spa charges. Imagine the shenanigans that can be had with the 700 billion for the rest of these shitbags. Unfugginbelievable.  HAGO AATR
