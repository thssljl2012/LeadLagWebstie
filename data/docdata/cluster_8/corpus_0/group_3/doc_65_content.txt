two days after a very horrible two hour ordeal with bank of america, trying desperately  to open a checking account when they wouldn't release any information as to why they had a lock on my IDENTITY that required weird closed-door meetings with back-room managers and override procedures--my $264 checking account, unaltered with no transactions to my name--became (and this is real):$888,622.88 worth of DEBT.there are several possibilities, but whatever it is my account has been locked and bank of america won't respond to any attempts at contact. this is fucking creepy as shit, and apparently there is a huge incongruity with my social security number. the one on my ss card is not "correct", though i don't quite understand how the fuck that is even physically possible.also...somehow the bank (with which no one in my family has ever held an account) knows my father, and his birthday, and questioned me against a list of people i had "potentially been in contact with".i feel like something really horrible is going on.and now we're on the brink of a depression.i can't seem to get this sick feeling out of my gut. last night at the office, mitch read aloud the newest poll numbers to cheers and high fives abound. in a fit of excitement some people scratched out the "can" in the "obama can win florida...blah blah" signs and wrote "WILL". as happy as i was, it didn't make me feel any better about what the fuck we're facing as a country right now. holy shit.if you're not scared, you're not paying attention.
