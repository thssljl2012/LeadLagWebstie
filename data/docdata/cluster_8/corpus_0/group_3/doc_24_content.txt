 OK.....I don't usually put a lot of political / current event commentary on here. Partly, it's because most of it is a bunch of absolute stupidity, and I could rant endlessly about many aspects of the current state of moronic activities. But every now and then, such depths of excess are reached that I just can't help myself. This is one of those times.At present, I have an auto insurance policy with AIG. That may change soon. Not because I've had any problem with AIG's service. It's more to do with a statement of protest at the slap in the face that AIG has inflicted on the American People. Click this link:http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iu5Il4dPnbfSer6RIAB7ZdLp5I6gA few days after our so-called "leaders" have so generously provided an 85 BILLION dollar bailout (at the expense of the American Taxpayer) to the idiots who for some unknown reason control a major portion of our economy, these sleazebags thank us all by taking a 400,000 dollar week-long vacation. WTF??????The rooms I've booked for our upcoming 5-day vacation will cost a little over 400 bucks. And they are not dumps, but I'm afraid they don't come with manicures, and steak &amp;amp; lobster, either. I wonder if Uncle Sam will bail me out if I spend way over my budget, defraud my employer, max out my credit cards, and steal from my customers. I think not. I think I'd end up with an all expense paid lodging in Leavenworth. That doesn't come with manicures, either.These worthless pieces of crap need to be slowly boiled in hot oil. For about three weeks.AIG executives, I hope you all enjoyed your manicures and 1200 dollar hotel rooms. I also hope you burn in hell. As soon as possible.I think I may change my policy to Geico. At least they amuse me with thier lizard and cavemen ads. AIG makes me want to throw up. Then find an AIG executive, and provide a few lessons in economics. With a baseball bat.Pathetic.
