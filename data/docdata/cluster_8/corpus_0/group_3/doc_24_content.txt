I must thank my dear friend Shtuey for seeing the bigger picture for all of us. And I must say thank you for helping me recover some of my memories of Denver. Shtuey you are my hero! From Shtuey, our guest for the day: At the outset I must thank Ms Placed Democrat&amp;#8217;s Renaissancelady 48 and Eastan McNeal at No Quarter for their exhaustive research, love of country, and wise council. How did we get here? How is it that &amp;#8220;subprime mortgages&amp;#8221; have brought us to the brink of economic collapse? Most people believe it is due to the predatory lending practices of financial institutions. That is the lie you have been sold. The truth is far more insidious. We are in fact on the brink of economic disaster because of the people who have sent Barack Obama. In order to understand how this happened we must begin with Saul Alinsky , the radical socialist who, after spending a great deal of time with the Al Capone crime family in Chicago, realized that the same shakedown tactics used by the mob to extort business, and control politicians, could be used by activists to shakedown banks and political institutions to advance a socialist agenda. These were tactics utilized by groups like ACORN, in an effort to lobby the government to pass laws that forced lending institutions to issue mortgages to low income/&amp;#8221;at risk&amp;#8221; borrowers who often had no way of paying the money back. But ACORN members probably did not lobby for these laws to bring down our economy, at least not knowingly. I believe that, apart from the leaders at the top, rank and file ACORN members legitimately believed they were fighting for low-income housing. But ACORN&amp;#8217;s backers were simply using Alinsky&amp;#8217;s method (never reveal your real agenda) to serve their own purposes. Who are these people? You know the names of two of them: Bill Ayers and Barack Obama. I suspect that they are more front men than anything else, though who knows who Ayers was with while he was in hiding? Where did ACORN get the funds to engage in the widespread lobbying (read extortion) that allowed them to shakedown lenders and politicians? From the money diverted to them by Bill Ayers and Barack Obama, via the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, and the Woods Fund, as well as with your tax dollars allocated by Congressional Democrats; the same Congressional Democrats that have received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Freddie and Fannie in the form of campaign contributions; the same Congressional Democrats that ignored Republican calls for the regulating and reform of Freddie and Fannie&amp;#8211;the institutions that took subprime mortgages, bundled them, and infected financial institutions worldwide&amp;#8230;all in the name of granting minorities and low income families access to housing (always the trouble begins with the most honorable of intentions, or at least it is made to seem so), but with the Leftists&amp;#8217; hidden purpose of initiating a worldwide economic collapse.  All of it accomplished with ACORN as the muscle. The root of the problem lies with the Community Reinvestment Act. The CRA was passed in 1977 and, according to Thomas J. DiLorenzo, &amp;#8220;compels banks to make loans to low-income borrowers and in what the supporters of the Act call &amp;#8220;communities of color&amp;#8221; that they might not otherwise make based on purely economic criteria.&amp;#8221; DiLorenzo goes on to explain: The original lobbyists for the CRA were the hardcore leftists who supported the Carter administration and were often rewarded for their support with government grants and programs like the CRA that they benefited from. These included various &amp;#8220;neighborhood organizations,&amp;#8221; as they like to call themselves, such as &amp;#8220;ACORN&amp;#8221; (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now). These organizations claim that over $1 trillion in CRA loans have been made, although no one seems to know the magnitude with much certainty. A U.S. Senate Banking Committee staffer told me about ten years ago that at least $100 billion in such loans had been made in the first twenty years of the Act. So-called &amp;#8220;community groups&amp;#8221; like ACORN benefit themselves from the CRA through a process that sounds like legalized extortion. The CRA is enforced by four federal government bureaucracies: the Fed, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The law is set up so that any bank merger, branch expansion, or new branch creation can be postponed or prohibited by any of these four bureaucracies if a CRA &amp;#8220;protest&amp;#8221; is issued by a &amp;#8220;community group.&amp;#8221; This can cost banks great sums of money, and the &amp;#8220;community groups&amp;#8221; understand this perfectly well. It is their leverage. They use this leverage to get the banks to give them millions of dollars as well as promising to make a certain amount of bad loans in their communities. A man named Bruce Marks became quite notorious during the last decade for pressuring banks to earmark literally billions of dollars to his organization, the &amp;#8220;Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America.&amp;#8221; He once boasted to the New York Times that he had &amp;#8220;won&amp;#8221; loan commitments totaling $3.8 billion from Bank of America, First Union Corporation, and the Fleet Financial Group. And that is just one &amp;#8220;community group&amp;#8221; operating in one city  Boston. Banks have been placed in a Catch 22 situation by the CRA: If they comply, they know they will have to suffer from more loan defaults. If they don&amp;#8217;t comply, they face financial penalties and, worse yet, their business plans for mergers, branch expansions, etc. can be blocked by CRA protesters, which can cost a large corporation like Bank of America billions of dollars. Like most businesses, they have largely buckled under and have surrendered to their bureaucratic masters. Consequently, banks in every community in America have been forced to hold a portfolio of bad loans, euphemistically referred to as &amp;#8220;subprime&amp;#8221; loans. In order to compensate themselves for the added risk of extending these loans, many lenders have increased the lending fees associated with mortgage loans. This is simply an indirect way of doing what banks always do  and what they must do to remain solvent: charging effectively higher rates of interest on riskier loans. But this is discriminatory!, complained the &amp;#8220;community organizations.&amp;#8221; Thus, if one browses the ACORN web site, one can read of their boasts of having &amp;#8220;predatory lending laws&amp;#8221; passed in numerous states which outlaw such fees, prohibiting banks from protecting themselves from the added risk involved in making forced loans to &amp;#8220;subprime&amp;#8221; borrowers.  According to the Consumer Rights League:  ACORN leveraged the Community Reinvestment Act in order to attack lenders&amp;#8217; reputations and secure financial resources for itself; it has also endorsed loans offered by companies that fund ACORN operations  ACORN&amp;#8217;s decades of lobbying and publicity seeking have contributed to the current housing crisis by lowering lending standards  Despite raking in a troubling 40 percent of its revenue from taxpayers over the last three years, ACORN Housing Corporation&amp;#8217;s actions range from controversial to borderline illegal:  AHC has worked to obtain mortgages for undocumented workers  AHC relies on undocumented income, &amp;#8220;under the table&amp;#8221; money that may not be reported to the Internal Revenue Service  ACORN&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;financial justice&amp;#8221; operations attack lenders for &amp;#8220;exotic&amp;#8221; loans, but AHC has recommended ten-year interest-only loans (which deny equity to the buyer) and reverse mortgages (which can be detrimental to senior citizens)  AHC may have violated federal law by failing to maintain a proper distinction between its tax-exempt housing work and the aggressive political activities of ACORN. CRL goes on to report: To understand the current subprime credit mess is to glimpse a world in which a politically active organization with a non-profit housing arm reaps millions of dollars through &amp;#8220;rent seeking&amp;#8221; or manipulation of favorable laws. ACORN and its non-profit housing arm have taken in millions of taxpayer and corporate dollars by abusing a three-decade-old law intended to help the poor obtain housing. For decades, the activist organization known as ACORN has grabbed headlinesand cashby attacking mortgage lenders in the name of citizens&amp;#8217; rights. Considerably less attention has been paid to the amount of taxpayer money that funds ACORN Housing Corporation (AHC) and to the financial rewards ACORN has amassed. But from whom did ACORN learn these Alinsky tactics? In part, from Barack Obama. As I said earlier, I believe rank and file ACORN members legitimately believe they are lobbying for minority and low income housing, unknowingly advancing a larger agenda to destroy our economic and financial institutions. But how has the cabal managed to infect the credit market worldwide? Let&amp;#8217;s ask Penny Pritzker, Barack Obama&amp;#8217;s campaign finance chair. It is now well documented that Pritzker was one of the driving forces behind the subprime mortgage fiasco, unleashing toxic loans into the market like a financial Typhoid Mary. Her bank, Superior, was the first to go under, and yet she made millions. From Dennis Bernstein&amp;#8217;s report: Though Superior Bank collapsed years before the current sub-prime turmoil that is rocking the world&amp;#8217;s financial markets  and pushing those millions of homeowners toward foreclosure  some banking experts say the Pritzkers and Superior hold a special place in the history of the sub-prime fiasco. &amp;#8220;The [sub-prime] financial engineering that created the Wall Street meltdown was developed by the Pritzkers and Ernst and Young, working with Merrill Lynch to sell bonds securitized by sub-prime mortgages,&amp;#8221; Timoth...
