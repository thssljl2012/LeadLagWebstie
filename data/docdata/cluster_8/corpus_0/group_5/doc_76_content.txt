I was reading today that CEO of Merrill Lynch had the balls to request a 10 Million dollar bonus this year because he felt he &amp;quot;deserved it&amp;quot;. You know, I deserve it too. I can think of a lot of other people who deserve 10 Million dollars. Better yet, NEED 10 Million dollars.&amp;nbsp;Fuck you, you pompous self-serving asshole. You DO understand you are part of the problem, and when your company is taken in by the likes of Bank of America that doesn't mean you're a success. That spells F A I L to me. What you deserve is to shut the fuck up, sell one of your 7 houses, or 3 of your cars....better yet, just shut the fuck up.&amp;nbsp;I guess I'm just being a hater, I don't know. I guess when I read that a CEO is bitching that he wants such an un-tangible amount of money to the rest of us as a BONUS blows my mind. Especially when there are those who don't get bonuses, fuck some of us are just lucky to be scraping by with a job.&amp;nbsp;If this financial crisis has shown anything it's that CEO's of major banks and companies are really fuckers. And now they too are in the borrowing business, begging for money from the FDIC...and what makes me sick, is some just might get it.
