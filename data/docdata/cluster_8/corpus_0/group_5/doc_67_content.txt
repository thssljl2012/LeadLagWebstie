BUT NOT ABOUT... my usual soap box topics.From CNN: Illinois governor backs workers, will halt business with lenderWhile I can understand why the workers are pissed, I think it's ridiculous to place the blame on Bank of America. This is not the BoA's fault. If the company (Republic) could not pay it's loans or it's fees, then it is the company's responsibility to inform it's employees and not the Bank's. I mean seriously. This is the most telling statement: "We had started to notice things, like machines disappearing from the plant during the weekends under cover of darkness," UE member Melvin Maclin said. "So we began asking questions, and management assured us everything was fine." If anyone should be slammed, it should be Republic. They should have filed for Bankruptcy like any other reasonable company (See Circuit City) and done what they can. To blame the banks is -stupid- and personally, I think it's harmful to allow BoA to take full responsibility because it would set a precedent that if a company fails and the -COMPANY EXECS- fail to comply with Federal Regulation, the Lender should then be forced to be stuck with the bill. That, to me, stinks of wrong.Yeah. It sucks that these guys were told by BoA that they've been laid off and only got a 3 day's notice. But you know what? If BoA hadn't said anything, I bet they would have come in one day and suddenly been faced with closed doors and foreclosure signs because the management didn't do their fucking jobs, took the money and ran.PS: I would like for you to note that when they arranged for a meeting between the workers, the bank and the company itself to sit down with a State representative, the company didn't send anyone.
