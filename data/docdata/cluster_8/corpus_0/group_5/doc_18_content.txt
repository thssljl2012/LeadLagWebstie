This morning I was thinking about the situation at Republic Window &amp; Door. Now, granted, I don't know enough about the situation to grasp all of the nuances, but I've never let that stop me before. It seems that the workers are upset because they haven't been paid for the last week of work they did. And this is understandable. However, it seems that they're also upset because they haven't been paid for an extra 75 days of work they didn't do. What?The company is closing its doors because it doesn't have the money to keep running. And Bank of America (who I have no love for) won't lend them more money. If I were a bank, I think that not lending money to a company that can't keep its doors open would qualify as a dumb-ass idea. But apparently our (now in the custody of the Feds) Governor disagrees and has told the state to stop doing business with BoA. Hooray!Seriously. What the hell is going on here? What am I missing in this situation?
