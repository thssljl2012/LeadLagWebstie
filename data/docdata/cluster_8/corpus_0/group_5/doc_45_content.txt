I suppose I could make some cynical comment about Blagojevich being a Democrat under investigation by a Republican-controlled FBI under a proven crooked White House. I could also make some cynical comment about the fact he was arrested the day AFTER he told state agencies to quit doing business with federal bailout darling Bank of America because it refused to continue providing payroll backing to that Chicago factory.Instead, I'll just ask my Illinois peeps on ye olde f-list: Is he really crooked, or is he being framed to drag down Obama (or something else) in some fashion?
