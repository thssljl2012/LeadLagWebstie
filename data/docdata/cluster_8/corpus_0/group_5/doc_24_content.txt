I accidentally sent Kelly money from an account which was extremely underfunded today. haha, my dad and Kelly are angels. I just hope citibank doesn't decide to charge me the overdraft fee anyway (it's only $25, but that's $25 I don't want to spend). I need to stop worrying about this and study! Finals tomorrow!!!!!
