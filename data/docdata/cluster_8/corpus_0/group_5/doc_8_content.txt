     Hyperinflation here we come                   By     Jon Herring          There are so many headwinds and cross currents in the market today,     it is all but impossible to predict what will happen in the short     term. There is too much volatility and noise. So, it pays to keep     your eyes on the horizon, focused on the long term and the biggest     trends.          Today, I want to tell about the biggest of all possible financial     trends: the eventual bankruptcy of the United States government. Or     should I say the existing bankruptcy of the U.S. government?          The United States government is facing an impending fiscal crisis.     Former Comptroller General David Walker calls it a cancer growing     from within. And the wheels for this were already set in motion     well before the financial crisis. With ongoing wars in Iraq and     Afghanistan, a costly stimulus package and falling tax receipts, the     U.S. was already neck deep in debt.          A     Trillion Dollar Deficit?          Even before the bailouts, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)     projected that the 2009 federal deficit would be nearly $482     billion. Since then however, our government has jacked up spending     by the trillions. In just a few months, we have already charted a     course to triple that deficit. Some experts even suggest the 2009     deficit could be as high as $2 trillion!          But, believe it or not, this is just a drop in the bucket compared     to the big picture          The     True Scope of Americas Fiscal Problem          Richard Fisher is the CEO of the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank and a     member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets     interest rate policy. In a speech in May of this year, he stated     that the total U.S. debt  including Medicare and Social Security      is more than $99 TRILLION!          Along the same lines, Laurence Kotlikoff, a Boston University     economist, suggests that the fiscal gap  which is the difference     between the number above and what we could reasonably expect to     collect  is $66 trillion.          That is the definition of bankruptcy. It is just a matter of time.     The scope and impact of our liabilities are stunning. But lets play     devils advocate and consider where this kind of money might come     from.          How can we possibly meet our obligations to retirees as well as     service our debt to foreign governments and still operate our own     government?          It     Wont Come from Cuts in Spending          Lets listen in on Fishers speech and consider what kind of     spending cuts we would have to make to close the gap on what we owe:          To     fully fund our nations entitlement programs would be to cut     discretionary spending by 97 percent. But hold on. That     discretionary spending includes defense and national security,     education, the environment and many other areas, not just those     controversial earmarks that make the evening news. All of them would     have to be cutalmost eliminatedto tackle this problem through     discretionary spending.          So, just to meet our current and future obligations, we would have     to virtually clear out Washington, D.C. And these changes would have     to be made to perpetuity. Now, Ron Paul might have cut government     back to its constitutionally mandated functions, but dont expect     anyone else in Washington to even consider the notion. Congress has     shown that it has NO moral regard for the long term economic     viability of our country.          It     Wont Come from Tax Increases          Even if we did cut the government back to the bare minimum (which we     wont), that still wouldnt solve the problem. We would also have to     raise taxes. By how much? Back to Richard Fisher:          Similarly on the taxation side, income tax revenue would have to     rise 68 percent and remain that high forever. Remember, though, I     said tax revenue, not tax rates. Who knows how much individual and     corporate tax rates would have to change to increase revenue by 68     percent?          We already dont collect enough tax revenues to pay the government's     budget. And with a recession taking hold and a depression on the     horizon, where are the tax revenues going to come from? Taxation is     simply not an option for this kind of money.          We     Cant Borrow it from Ourselves          During World War II, we borrowed the money we needed from ourselves.     But Americans had a high savings rate then. This is no longer true.     Most Americans are upside down, with credit cards, mortgages, cars     and other loans not to mention growing unemployment.          It     Wont Come from Foreigners          For many, many years, the U.S. government has been able to pay for     anything and everything we wanted to by borrowing the funds from     other countries. We didnt even pay for the Iraq war it has all     been borrowed money. But other countries are beginning to balk, and     for a variety of reasons.          For one thing, the countries that do have reserves to lend us are     turning their attention inward. Just this week, China began to shift     its policy away from plowing reserves into forex and instead is     investing internally (the Chinese government announced more than a     half a trillion-dollar internal stimulus package this week).          This is BAD news for the U.S. government bond market. Just as     Americas spending goes parabolic and we need to sell more debt than     ever, the biggest buyer just left the trading floor.          Increases in spending and liabilities along with decreases in     foreign lending equals a recipe for disaster.          So, where will the money come from?          This is a job for the printing press.          While we are certainly facing deflation in the near term and a very     choppy market, the groundwork has been laid for hyperinflation,     soaring interest rates and exploding gold and silver prices. So     forget about the short term cross currents, and focus on the long     term trends you can bank on.
