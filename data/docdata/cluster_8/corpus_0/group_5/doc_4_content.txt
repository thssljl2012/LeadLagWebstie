 Get ready to hear "Bah, Humbug" accusations from the Democrats over the next few days.  If Republicans in Congress don't get on message post-bailout rejection today, they'll all be typecasted as Christmas Carol Scrooges, and that image could doom sound fiscal policy for decades.&amp;nbsp; To avoid this cheap class warfare pushback, Republicans must push continue their courageous stand and push to recall last month's $700B banking bailout -- and do it now.  Last night, the Republican U.S.Senate caucus stood firm as the loyal opposition against an automaker bailout that will force the Big Three to restructure if they really want to survive.&amp;nbsp; Because the U.S. Senate bailout promoters were unable to gather the needed 60 votes to move ahead the auto bailout last night, the UAW will be forced to re-negotiate their contracts and pension plans. The car manufacturers will be forced to re-think their product line and the way they compensate their executives.&amp;nbsp; No one under-estimates the short-term pain such a development will cause, but there's much more to be gained than lost long-term after a forced industrywide re-structuring.  Unless the Republicans get out in front and declare the value of promoting the expansion of "freedom to work" policies nationwide, this will develop quickly into the classic class warfare debate.&amp;nbsp; Republican cannot sit on their hands and allow themselves to be pegged as white collar elitist Republicans versus blue collar average-Joe Democrats.&amp;nbsp; This morning Texas Governor Richard Perry and South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford went on the offensive, promoting the value of right to work public policy and lauding the foreign car manufacturers in their states that are thriving.&amp;nbsp; This message needs to be hit hard in the wake of last night's bailout rejection.&amp;nbsp; Now, there's should be a national demand for the banking industry to come back to the table, too.&amp;nbsp; Those Republicans who didn't have the guts to do so before the election should call for a re-negotiation of the banking bailout that demands re-structuring of the banking industry, accountability for executive perks and golden parachute plans, as well as an accounting for what they're done with what they have so far.  Bank of America announced this morning that despite taking billions from taxpayers,they're being forced to lay off 35,000 workers the first of the year.&amp;nbsp; It's time to call them back and demand to know what they did with the funds they got.&amp;nbsp;   This is not only urgent economic policy, for the Republicans, it's urgent public policy.&amp;nbsp; It's time today to call for renegotiation of the banking industry bailout to follow the courageous stand taken last night on the auto manufacturer bailout.&amp;nbsp; If that doesn't happen, you will not have seen anything like the Republican Scrooge political ads that will soon unfold.
