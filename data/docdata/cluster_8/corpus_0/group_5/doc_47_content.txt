&amp;nbsp;I'm currently chatting online with a customer service rep from Bank of America (who can just go suck my left asscheek, by the way), and I always wonder... with these online customer service people, do you think you're really talking to a person? &amp;nbsp;Or is it just a computer programmed to answer your questions based on the words you use?
