As they profited handsomely by the grotesque Paulson and Illuminati banker bail-out (msnbc tells you it's $700 billion - it's not- it's now $9 trillion), which our great grand children will still be suffering from, the Governor has called on this bank (which helped fund the Vietnam War) to LOAN to local businesses -to keep people with their jobs- or END all business dealings with them. It's about time a man of moral reason and courage ran things and started calling some fucking shots around here. "If all that Americans want is security, they can go to prison. Theyll have enough to eat, a bed and a roof over their heads. But if an American wants to preserve his dignity and his equality as a human being, he must not bow his neck to any dictatorial government."    Dwight D. EisenhowerI haven't much information -good or bad- on Ike. However, I am pretty certain he was a good man. He selected true patriots to his cabinet. It looks to me like he, McKinley, Kennedy and Reagan are the only "good" presidents we've had in damn near a century and a half. They all had their faults -most notably Reagan- but simply compare them and their years to what we've seen since 1989. By the way, Reagan was ordered by the Illuminati that he must take on Bush Sr. as VP. And Reagan, being one of them to begin with, obliged. FDR was absolute criminal filth. His brother less so. Wilson was the weak coward who established the Fed in 1913. Nothing need be said for Johnson, Carter, Nixon, Bush, Clinton or any of the others since Lincoln who was shot in the head just like Kennedy was by none other than the bankers (again). The last one to take them on and win was Andrew Jackson, whose epitaph on his headstone reads "I Killed The Bank."
