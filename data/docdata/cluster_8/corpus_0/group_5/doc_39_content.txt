 In a landslide win, you voted Bank of America as the best commercial bank of 2008. My bank account isn't with B of A  it's with a smaller, more regional chain  but Bank of America is my credit card carrier and I don't have any complaints from that perspective.  It was a dramatic year for banks, and Bank of America has managed to keep itself out of most of the chaos. The large, national bank tried to set itself up for greater success when it purchased Merrill Lynch, and it's a decision I doubt has seen a moment of regret.  Do you have an account with B of A? What do you like or dislike about it?  Source
