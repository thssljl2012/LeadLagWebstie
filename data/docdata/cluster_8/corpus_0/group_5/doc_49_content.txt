            Quick Link for Rates, Recap of this week's postsHappy Holidays. This is a reduced version of my weekly rate recap. I was going to skip a week, but rates have declined so much in the last week, I thought it was important to update the rates. Banks are still responding to the historic Fed rate cut on December 16th.Savings Account RatesRates continued to trend down. There are still 3 banks offering 4% savings accounts. DollarSavingsDirect continues to offer 4% APY and EverBank continues to offer 4.08% APY guaranteed for 3 months. I doubt these will last too much longer. In a few months, I'm afraid it may be difficult to find a 3% savings account. Below is the list of savings account rate changes for this week. With so many rate cuts, it's hard to keep track of these. There were over two dozen cuts that I reported on in my December 20th weekly recap. So if you don't find a rate cut below, check that recap from last week. The full list of savings account rates is farther down.Rate Hikes:NoneRate Drops:GMAC Bank Savings - 3.25% (was 3.75%)Venture Bank Direct - 3.50% (was 3.60%)OneUnited - 3.00% (was 3.35%)ETrade Savings - 3.01% (was 3.30%)iGObanking - 3.08% (was 3.28%)Nationwide MMA - 2.97% (was 3.27%)FNBO Direct Savings 2.80% (was 3.25%)GMAC Bank MMA - 2.75% (was 3.25%)National City 6mo promo - 3.00% (was 3.25%)Capital One/Costco Savings - 3.05% (was 3.37%)Capital One - 3.00% (was 3.25%)Capital One/Costco MMA - 2.35% (was 3.00%)Capital One MMA - 2.10% (was 2.75%)IndyMac MMA - 2.75% $25K+ (was 3.25%)M&amp;amp;T Bank savings - 2.75% (was 3.00%)Discover MMA - 2.75% (was 2.90%)iGObanking checking - 1.75% (was 2.00%)Citibank Ultimate Savings - 2.50% (was 2.75%)Nationwide Certificate of Deposit RatesCD rates again trended down this week even more than savings account rates. For those who haven't locked into a CD, the next few days may be the last chance for some decent rates at credit unions. Many credit typically change rates at the start of month, so many still have some decent rates. These are included in the list below:The full list of nationwide CD rates is farther down.  4.00% 6-mo CD at Navy FCU (account review)4.00% 7-mo Add-On CD at America's CU (account review)4.00% 12-mo CD at Mountain America CU (account review)4.00% 12-mo CD at GMAC Bank (account review)4.00% 16-mo CD at DollarSavingsDirect (account review4.15% 17-mo CD at Western FCU (account review)4.75% 3-year CD at PenFed (account review)5.10% 5-year CD at Navy FCU (account review)Reward Checking AccountsMany reward checking accounts continue offering 5-percent-plus yields, but like all other deposit accounts, banks are cutting these rates. I've added a few new reward checking accounts this week, and I've spent some time updating rates on my existing reward checking accounts (almost 300). I'm afraid this will be keeping me busy in the weeks to come.For my full list of reward checking accounts around the nation, please refer to my High Yield Checking website. I'll be updating this website next week.The rates listed below are based on Annual Percentage Yield (APY). No minimum balances are required unless noted. MMA next to the rates indicate a money market account. Most MMAs have check writing and ATM cards. Online savings accounts usually lack both of these. The top lists include banks and credit unions with broad availability and with minimums around $10K or less.
