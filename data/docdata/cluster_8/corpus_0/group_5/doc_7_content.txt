 You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. ~Inigo Montoya, The Princess Bride It may be inconceivable for you to misuse a word, but a quick look around the web reveals plenty of people doing it. And its all too easy when we hear or see others use words incorrectly and parrot them without knowing its wrong. We know by now that great copy and content often purposefully breaks the rules of grammar. Its only when you break the rules by mistake that you look dumb. So lets take a look at 27 commonly misused words. Some are common mistakes that can cost you when trying to keep a readers attention. Others are more obscure and just interesting to know. Adverse / Averse Adverse means unfavorable. Averse means reluctant. Afterwards Afterwards is always wrong. Its afterward. Complement / Compliment  I see this one all the time. Complement is something that adds to or supplements something else. Compliment is something nice someone says about you. Criteria Criteria is plural, and the singular form is criterion. If someone tells you they have only one criteria, you can quickly interject and offer that it be they get a clue. Farther / Further Farther is talking about a physical distance.  How much farther is Disney World, Daddy? Further is talking about an extension of time or degree. Take your business further by reading Copyblogger. Fewer / Less  If you can count it, use fewer. If you cant, use less. James has less incentive to do what I say. Tony has fewer subscribers since he stopped blogging. Historic / Historical  Historic means an important event. Historical means something that happened in the past. Hopefully  This word is used incorrectly so much (including by me) it may be too late. But lets make you smarter anyway. The rule is you only use hopefully if you&amp;#8217;re describing the way someone spoke, appeared, or acted.  Smart:  I hope she says yes. Wrong:  Hopefully, she says yes. Wrong:  Hopefully, the weather will be good.
