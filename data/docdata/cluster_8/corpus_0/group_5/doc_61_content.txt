This is the first post in the &amp;#8220;Failing America&amp;#8221; series here on Scripted/Addicted. I&amp;#8217;ve created this series because of my patriotism and the sick feeling I get every time I&amp;#8217;m reminded of my country&amp;#8217;s current appetite for self-destruction. The &amp;#8220;are you proud to be an American?&amp;#8221; tagline is, of course, rhetorical. The U.S. government continues to reward mediocrity. This time, in the form of YET ANOTHER BAILOUT to the American auto industry. This &amp;#8220;dumb spending&amp;#8221; is truly infuriating. When will U.S. automobile manufacturers realize that they have to change their antiquated ways to compete with foreign brands? The answer is: NEVER. Why? Because the CEOs of these companies want to see how much money they can fit into their pockets before moving on to their next FAILED PROJECT. &amp;#8220;Take the money and run,&amp;#8221; sang Steve Miller. And the latest circus act continues&amp;#8230; Are you proud to be an American? From Steven Clemons over at The Huffington Post: The U.S. government is about to kick $15 billion over to the U.S. auto industry. And what we have seen with all of the bailout cases thus far &amp;#8212; from AIG to Citibank &amp;#8212; is that that amount is probably just a down payment on a future bigger draw. There is NOTHING in the current outlines of the auto bailout package that requires the auto industry to keep jobs in the U.S. This money can go to help them manage their facilities abroad &amp;#8212; in lower wage countries &amp;#8212; while facilities continue to shut down in the U.S. with jobs shifted overseas. In fact, despite some minor verbal, non-binding assurances from the auto chiefs that American taxpayer funds would not be applied to offshoring activities, there are no deals, no guarantees at all this bailout money could in fact be financing a new major offshoring trend.
