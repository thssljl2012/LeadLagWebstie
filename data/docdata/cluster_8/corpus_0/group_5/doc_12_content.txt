A few days ago I posted about a group of workers refusing to vacate their factory until they were payed the money owed to them. Compounding this situation is the fact that the Bank Of America, which recently received 25 billion dollars in tax money from the bailout is refusing to len a few million to the ompany to keep these 200+employees working.You can read more details and ways you can help your fellow workers in that post which is located hereAs of now there is a move at the state level to cease all business with the Banok Of america untill it agrees to help the workers. BoA in response says it is not the bank but the company which has financial obligations to the workers. In the middle of course are the workers who have the most to lose in this debate. Rumors are circulatng now that the workers are considering to ingnore the factory closure all together and resume production as a worker owned factory. This is a tactic which has worked remarkably well in Argentina
