I had a pleasant experience recently at a Wells Fargo ATM. They have begun behaviorally targeting customers who use their ATM&#8217;s. It was so nice to insert my card and the first option on the screen was to deposit a check to my checking account. Rather than have to click three of four times to get there, it was one click away. I see this as a big step in the financial industry, making it easier to transact personal business. The web has this capability as well, but I have yet to see it happen in the financial services category. I only have a Wells account and one other checking/savings account so it may be available through larger institutions like Bank of America or Chase. Imagine logging in and seeing the results that you look at the most. Wouldn&#8217;t that make banking so much easier. Log in and see all transactions, or see all income or whatever you would like to see based off your previous experiences. I am sure people would raise a hand or two about privacy, but in the end of the day it&#8217;s behind a secure login and they aren&#8217;t doing anything with the data other than presenting it in a more usable format. At the end of the day, its&#8217; better for the user. I saw the behavioral targeting of the ATM in a similar manner, until I realized it made it much easier for me to transact and leave. Chalk up a win for behavioral targeting and the financial services industry and let it continue to the web.
