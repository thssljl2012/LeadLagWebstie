In no particular order:Blago is not indicted for anything, and neither is Rahm Emanual.]Burris is seated as a Senator (with full rights, regardless of whatever "separate but equal" claptrap Reid is peddling now).Franken is seated in the Senate, without being certified by the secretary of state or any fuss from the Senate proper.Bank of America fails.Citigroup fails.AIG fails.The press coverage of Obama is grotesquely fawning and oppressively frequent until about July or August, and then it peters off until he is mostly ignored, all as a cover for him. If you can't say something good...The stock market goes inexplicably up until about March, despite a steady stream of unusually bad economic news, and then it plummets for the rest of the year, but without much coverage.There is an uptick (10%, noticeable, but not huge) in hate crimes, mainly black on white and black/Hispanic.Hank Paulsen stays on as Treasury Secretary because Summers is deemed to be too inexperienced to handle the size and frequency of bailouts.Obama raises taxes for every income bracket.The cost of bailouts initiated in 2009 will top $35 trillion.There will be no major terrorist attack against US interests.Russia will invade another former satellite nation.There will be one major Muslim riot, a la the cartoon riots.I'm often wrong, so I'm expecting these are wrong, too. But if even one is right, this year will provide some entertainment value.
