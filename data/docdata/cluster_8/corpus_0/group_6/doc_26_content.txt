Obama, as he has done with Eric Holder, attempts to push through Tim Geithner by arguing that he merely made an innocent mistake, but not really grappling with the facts.   Why didn't Geithner realize, when the IRS audited him in 2006 and ordered him to pay payroll taxes on IMF income for 2003-04, that he also needed to pay payroll taxes on his IMF income from 2001-02? Why did he wait until he was nominated to pay?  What Obama is really doing is counting on Congress' lack of appetite for a political fight with a popular new president at a time of economic crisis to paper over a lapse. Here, meanwhile, is another lapse -- a new report from Pro Publica and Jeff Gerth detailing Geithner's regulatory missteps and lax oversight as head of the NY Fed that paved the way for Citibank's near collapse.  But, you know, everyone makes mistakes.
