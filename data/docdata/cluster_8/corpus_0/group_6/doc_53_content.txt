      My nine-year old daughter checked her Passbook from her savings account and wanted to know why the bank was deducting $2 per month when they were only giving her .75 a month in interest. I couldn't come up with a logical response to her question, even with an MBA. So, she is finally going to get her wish. Her money will be taken out of Florence Savings Bank and will be deposited into the bank of her choice--Bank of America. She is smart enough to know that she can more readily access her money if there is an ATM close by when she is traveling with her parents. Of course we've yet to break the news to her that nine-year olds do not receive their own ATM cards. At least not yet! It is ironic that we are trying to teach our children about the value of money and they wind up teaching us that somehow the math simply does not add up! Are the younger people in your organizations trying to teach you some valuable lessons? It may be time to start listening.
