Looks like Bank of America is getting another $20 billion or so from the feds for a bailout.  In my experience as a former credit card customer, they do a sh^&amp;ty job and seem to screw up everything they touch.      It's amazing how many people I talk with think that they are getting a bailout from the Feds.      http://money.cnn.com/2009/01/16/news/companies/bofa_new_bailout/index.htm?cnn=yes
