When Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch, did you stop in your tracks and say, "the biggest, strongest, smartest bank just became another broken, senseless, robbing institution which will only hasten the collapse of our current style of government and living". Well I did and I don't need to tell you, if we still have 1 1/2 more years of topsie turvie downward spiral, and this is taking place today. well, the carpet is about to be swept clean so to speak.And another thing. now that the banks and other typical institutions have received the first second and third round of "bail-outs" and seem to have spent it all, yes all on bonus money. As we sit and watch this unfold, how can I not believe that this is anything but the largest heist in modern day history.I believe we will pull out of this, I don't think it will make us stronger, but I am sure it will make us different.(back to paying my bills, which I'm o.k. with.)BrianCopyright 2006.
