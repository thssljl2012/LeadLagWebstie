      Charlotte I didn&#8217;t know which title to pick for this post. I had many to choose from: Self-Delusion, Denial, Economy, etc. I rarely read news, watch television, or listen to commercial radio, so lots of times, I&#8217;m out of the loop, which is just fine by me. However, I have been ingesting a bit of news on a daily basis, with regards to our new president.  I must say that I was very impressed with his first bold moves to shut down secret CIA prisons, stopping torture, etc. I like it!  The other day, right after his inauguration, I remember thinking that this was former president Bush&#8217;s first good night of sleep since 9/11/2001, and the first of many sleepless nights for president Obama. The pressure is on to &#8216;fix&#8217; the economy &#8230; throw money at the problem. I&#8217;ve been through a few recessions during my working career. The last major one came at the end of 2001, when the Internet bubble burst.  Though, honestly, I believe that that recession, even though bad, paled in comparison to this one. This one hit us in the foundation &#8230; where the money lives. Spending is down, credit is tight. It&#8217;s tough for weak businesses to survive in that market. Certainly, this has affected our family, as it has many others. I lost my job with Bank of America in June of this year. I finally, as you know, took a job in Charleston, SC. 200 miles from home. Initially, I believed that it would be for only 3 months, until things got better. I remember when I got my employee badge. It had an expiration date of August 3, 2009. I scoffed, internally, thinking that I won&#8217;t have to renew it because I&#8217;ll be home by then.  I&#8217;m about to sign a 6-month lease with my apartment. Things are not getting better in Charlotte. As a matter of fact, as more and more numbers are released, we see that things are actually getting worse. I will have to renew that badge! Since the buy-out of Wachovia by Wells Fargo, we don&#8217;t know if my wife will get to keep her job. Fortunately, Wells-Fargo is a slow mover, deliberate planner,  and a very conservative bank. They were one of the few that didn&#8217;t have problems in this banking crises.  We&#8217;ll see &#8230; I&#8217;ve now experienced the end of summer in Charleston, the complete autumn, the beginning and middle of winter, heading towards the spring and summer.  I&#8217;m still displaced. I&#8217;m still &#8220;Doing what is necessary.&#8221;.  I hope that, in some small way, this is a lesson to my children to cast of the attitude that children sometimes get, of doing only what they want to do. Sometimes, we have to do what we have to do .. that which is necessary.
