In addition to the lockout drama of the night/early morning before, I almost made an even bigger stupid mistake by falling for a phishing email.  I've reported the email to Bank of America, changed my online banking password (my account hasn't been touched), and I think I'm beeing a teensy bit too hard on myself, but at the same time I do need to be more careful. I have no idea where my head is at these days. :( I wish I were distracted because of something fun or squee-worthy, but I don't feel like I'm in a very good place right now and that's a drag. I hope I meet my doing-stupid-things quota soon, hopefully before I cause any other expensive disaster!
