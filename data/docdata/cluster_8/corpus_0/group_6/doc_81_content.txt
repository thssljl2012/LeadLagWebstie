There's bailouts, then there's just plain lunacy ... or pork-barrel politics on a scale that'd shock even a snake.I'm a supporter of a limited bailout of the financial sector, let's get that straight. It's very clear that without a functioning financial sector, our current recession would've become a full blown depression that would have lasted for years.But, once US Democrats got the bailout bug ... or was it simply time to repay their "donars" ... they've fallen completely off the rails.What makes me say this?The supposed pending bailout of Bank of America, that's what. Now, this isn't just another bailout, this is funding to help Bank of America survive its purchase of Merrill Lynch. BAC claims it didn't know that Merrill's debt load was so large ... and I don't know my wife's name ... and Al Gore isn't a tubby.I'll type slowly, in case you missed it ... BAC-gets-money-to-buy-out-Merrill ... even-though-BAC-can't-afford-to-buy-out-Merrill. Some will counter that the BAC Bailout hasn't happened yet ... which is true ... but with socialists in charge who owe their existance to Wall Street donars and Race-baiting Social Activists, what do you think the chances are of BAC being told to take a hike. After all, it is Democrats who are largely to blame for the financial sector meltdown in the first place.... And, the Democrats in Washington, who have made it clear that they're going to make the Bush-Bailouts look like the warmup act ... will go for it. What can we expect, I suppose, from a President Elect whose known nothing all his working life but leeching off of government largess and a Democrat Senate and Congress who've cuddled up to Wall Street like whores to a John.Let the orgy begin.Celestial Junk Blog
