 Any given day on Twitter, there is discussion about customer experience. Typically, it&#8217;s bad. Bad tweets about bad experiences on the phone with customer service people, standing in line for problems that shouldn&#8217;t have happened to begin with, bad bills, bad fees, bad bad bad! Recently, a heated discussion spread across the Twittersphere thanks to Laura Fitton&#8217;s (pistachio) post about her experience with Bank of America. A series of Fitton&#8217;s frustrated tweets about fees, broken online banking and customer service disrespect led other customers to share their own harrowing tales. Oh, and all of these posted with the searchable hashtag #BOA for all to see and search. It should be noted that Fitton is a force on Twitter. With more than 15,000 followers, she has influence in pretty much every industry across social media. She&#8217;s also seen as an expert on microblogging - the very thing Twitter is used for - and helps all of us get it right. Eventually, the rant ended with this tweet from Laura: &#8220;while still savagely frustrated with BOA&#8217;s fees/long check holds/other cust service snafus, i gotta hand it to @bofa_help for jumping in.&#8221; So, eventually, after literally 100&#8217;s of people posted about their own terrible experiences and 1000&#8217;s of people watched this unfold, a BOA representative on Twitter got wind of the trouble and reached out directly to Laura. This type of personal outreach can do a lot to solve a singular customer issue. But by then, untold damage had been suffered to the brand. There are many blogs about how to use Twitter to monitor brand reputation. This isn&#8217;t one of them. The conversation on Twitter or blogs or Facebook does not just happen there. It happens with your customer service reps on the phones, with your branch managers and tellers, and with your customers who take the time (and are so angry) to actually write via your web site or even snail mail to the CEO. What is Bank of America doing to listen elsewhere? And how are they addressing the perception of high fees without appropriate levels of service? I would say a careful examination of their current customer experience is in order.
