Pre-approval with the bank who owns the home: When making an offer on a REO home it is to your advantage to be pre-approved with the bank that owns the home. So if you are planning on using Countrywide, for example, your chances of getting a countrywide home offer excepted are better compared with a buyer with the same offer from a competing bank.Since most of the listing are either wells Fargo or Countrywide(BofA). I recommend to buyers to get qualified with both. Different websites which list homes by bank: All of the different banks who sell homes as foreclosures have their own websites which list the homes they own. Below is a list of the different websites banks have set up to preview their homes. Its a good idea to check out what homes are available for the bank you are planning on doing business with.Wells Fargo REO:https://www.pasreo.com/reo/Washington Mutual REO (WAMU):http://www.wamuproperties.comCountrywide REO:http://www.countrywide.com/purchase/f_reo.aspHSBC REO:http://www.banking.us.hsbc.com/National City Mortgage REOhttp://www.ncmcreo.com/IndyMac Bank REO:http://apps.indymacbank.com/individuals/realestate/search.aspWachovia REO:http://reo.wachovia.com/Citibank REOhttp://www.citimortgage.com/Mortgage/Oreo/SearchListing.doAmerican Home Mortgage REO:http://www.ahmhomes.comFDIC Real Estate Ownedhttp://www4.fdic.gov/DRRORE/watch this website: www.recovery.gov
