                   One of the problems with the health care debate in this country is that it's called "the health care debate." But it's not. It's the "health spending" debate. It's an economic issue. Successful health reform would do less to reduce illness than to reduce medical bankruptcy. Which is why it would be nice to cleave the debate in two. Continue health spending reform. That's urgent. Without it our national finances go the way of Citibank's balance sheet. But also have a health policy.Labels: care, health
