Well I just about had a heart attack when I visited my Bank of America account only to find a Paypal payment for A$773.34 which I hadn't authorized. I've been on the phone for a little over an hour calling my bank to stop the transaction and file a claim. Then I called Paypal itself. Thankfully the bank Gods saw fit to stop the transaction dead in its tracks. I was phished and they knew it and the money is being refunded. But the event has set into motion a mad dash to renew everything, and I mean EVERYTHING I have opened online. I don't know how they phished me so I'm being very careful. Email addresses I've had since 2000 are being deleted. All email passwords are being changed. My Bank of America Online password is being changed in preparation for cancellation. On Thursday once the money is refunded and everything is set to rights I plan to go to Bank of America and open up a new account and close the old one, since the phisher undoubtly knows a thing or two about my personal information which means I"ll be getting new checks and a debit card. Geez, he/she threw my entire world off its axis. I don't even know if I'll ever use Paypal again. The scary thing is I have no idea where this information is obtained. I just turned twenty-three today and I've been initiated into an eye-opening experience. Safeguard everything. Now, I'll try to go back to not being paranoid.&amp;nbsp;Oh, on a side note, its not all bad news. I have a job interview today, so I'm superexcited about that. Happy Three Kings Day Everybody! (Betcha forgot what today was!)
