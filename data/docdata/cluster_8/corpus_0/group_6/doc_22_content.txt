The hold back was not due to the "one Latin bitch from Bank of America in Chicago." ... She actually was right and I did some investigation as to her questioning the Appraisal and it turns out that as I had suspected from the get go but our brokers, realtors and friends were telling me that we want it to be at the asking price so we can get the loan.I kept saying I did not want that and I was there for the appraisal of the house and told that goddamn appraiser NOT TO STRETCH the appraisal not once, not twice but on three different occasions and he did it anyway and when I questioned him doing it I was told that I was wrong.Well the little latin bitch in Chicago (no not you Carlos) was right, the broker had the appraiser called her and the appraisal was taken down by $15,000.00... CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS SHIT....So now our bank will only loan us the new appraisal price and being that this is a short sale that we have been working on for 5 months almost, it has to go back to the bank that owns the house to see if they are willing to drop the price. Which is doubtful....I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW DO I FUCKING SUE THIS APPRAISER???????I have never ever never wanted to sue anyone in my life, but I will say that this is SURELY the first time.HELP....
