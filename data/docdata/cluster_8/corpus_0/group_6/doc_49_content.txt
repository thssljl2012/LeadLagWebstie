Obama who ran as friend of the common man is now the Patron Saint of the former filthy rich and wants to use the common peoples money to bail out his contributors...Pay to Play at the national level.Democracy 21 -- Politico: Wall Street invested heavily in ObamaBarack Obama boasted on the campaign trail that his administration would not be beholden to special interests, because his presidential bid was funded by small donations from regular folks.But a Politico analysis of career contributions to the inner circle of the incoming White House  President-elect Obama, Vice President-elect Joe Biden and chief of staff Rahm Emanuel  finds some big special interests that have been investing in the three Democrats for years.The list of top donors to the trios campaigns includes many firms at the heart of the financial meltdown  including taxpayer-funded bailout beneficiaries Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America  and a host of other troubled investment houses that may find themselves seeking money from the new Obama administration, which has also pledged tougher regulations.The analysis shows that, even as Obamas presidential campaign leaned to a great extent on small online donations to raise a record-shattering $662 million, Obama and the men who have become his closest lieutenants have held special appeal to donors from certain moneyed industries. The president-elect, meanwhile, has leaned on leaders from those industries for policy advice and assistance during his campaign and transition, and has installed some in his new administration.
