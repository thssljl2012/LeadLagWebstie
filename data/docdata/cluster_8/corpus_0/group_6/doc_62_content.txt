 As Ireland&#8217;swidening economic crisis shows, government intervention inevitably worsens a bad situation rather than improves it. The Wall Street Journal has an interesting piece here looking at the Irish government&#8217;s ham-handed efforts to revive the country&#8217;s economy, including nationalizingthe Anglo-Irish Bank. &#8220;What is upsetting about Ireland&#8217;s case is that only six months ago most of its economic problems could have been managed and treated as the growing pains of an adolescent economy, by forcing banks to write down asset values, for example. &#8220;Instead, Ireland&#8217;s policy makers are on course for a painful deflationary spiral, largely by focusing on problems that are only tangential to the real economy, such as the commercial property sector, and by avoiding those that merit full attention, namely small and medium-size businesses.&#8221; US policy makers would do well to pay attention to what&#8217;s going on across the pond, particularly regarding banks. There&#8217;s been talk of nationalizing major American institutionssuch as Bank of America, but that would be a very bad idea. Economics professor William Buitersayseven partial bank nationalization effortsdon&#8217;t work. &#8220;Partial state ownership and the threat of future state control incentivizes banks to stop lending,&#8221; he says on his blog ft.com/maverecon. &#8220;Banks look to pay back government money as soon as possible to get the government out of its hair, causing them to hoard liquidity.&#8221;
