Posted By: Alex CrippenDateline NBC aired portions last night (Sunday) of an interview with Warren Buffett by Tom Brokaw. Buffett tells Brokaw that Barack Obama is the right "commander in chief for the economy" but warns that no one should expect a "miracle" turnaround in the next few months. The two men also covered many other topics, including Obama's leadership style, excessive executive compensation, the challenges facing Detroit's automakers, China, and the role of greed in good times and bad. This is the second part of the complete transcript of that interview, as provided by NBC News.
