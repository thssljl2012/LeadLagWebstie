 So, for obvious reasons with the mortgage market decline, Taylor has been looking for another job.  He's applied for dozens and interviewed with about 8.  None have worked out; which we assumed at the time because Bank of America (who he works for now) opened a position 20 minutes North of where we live in late November and Taylor really wanted that job.So he talked to the manager in charge of hiring, who has been after him previously for the exact same job, and she more or less said that he was well qualified and she was considering him.Fast forward a couple weeks.The manager told Taylor he'd have to hold of a couple weeks until the Bank of America - Merrill Lynch merger was complete Dec. 31.  So we've waited.He didn't hear anything from her, even though she said that she wanted the person interviewed and given an offer Jan. 1, as soon as B o A opened the position again.So we waited some more.Then the details of the merger came to the surface.  Apparently Merrill Lynch had more bad loan write-offs than they had initially let on (think BILLIONS and BILLIONS more).  So, in addition to the cuts BoA had already planned and announced earlier this year (or last, I can't remember), the company cut the bottom (least producing) 30 percent associates.And guess what?  Had Taylor been hired, he would have been in that 30 percent because he would be new and still trying to pass his series tests. We know this because two guys were hired in LR when Taylor was initially talking to the manager, and they were both laid off this week.So, even though Taylor is making VERY little right now (I'd put it into numbers, but lets just say its nearly 2.5x less than he was making 6 months ago), we cannot complain.  He's still employed.  And I know that Heavenly Father knew what was best.  I just didn't understand.  Now I know.
