       An interesting exchange I had on Facebook this morning, regarding the distribution of TARP funds to financial institutions like Bank of America. Say what you will, but I think the lack of accountability is simply outrageous&#8230;  Status: Goldie B of A is getting more bailout $$$ with my tax $$$, then why does their customer service stink???via Twitter - 9:15am - Comment  Ray Metoyer at 9:31am January 16 Don&#8217;t get me started talking about these BAILOUT Buttheads! See, Now I&#8217;m mad all over again!  Stephen Alford at 9:41am January 16 The top ten banks were forced to accept the money from the government. Actually, not all banks needed/wanted the funds.  Stephen Alford at 9:42am January 16 &#8230; but I hear you about customer service.  Ray Metoyer at 9:56am January 16 These banks weren&#8217;t forced to accept the money and tighten their credit policies and not work with cash/credit strapped consumers and customers. They&#8217;ve done nothing to help people who are struggling!  Stephen Alford at 9:57am January 16 They were forced to accept the money.  Ray Metoyer at 9:58am January 16 But what have they done with it to help consumers?  Stephen Alford at 9:58am January 16 They haven&#8217;t done anything. I agree with you on that.  Ray Metoyer at 9:59am January 16 That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m angry about!  Goldie Taylor at 10:07am January 16 B of A ASKED for additonal bailout funds of $20 BILLION. They used the initial bailout money to fund acquisitions of other ailing institutions, all the while cutting credit to businesses and individuals. They acquired CountryWide and Merrill Lynch, stregthening their market position and leaving us empty handed. And let&#8217;s not start talking about the Credit Default Swaps they engaged in.  Ray Metoyer at 10:10am January 16 And there were no strings attached to the money; we don&#8217;t even know what they&#8217;ve used it for except certain CEO bonuses.
