So, I just moved here from the east.  I've discovered that Bank of America does not really exist here (outside of ATMs that don't accept deposits)...so it's time to find a new bank.  Anyone have any recommendations?  I've seen alot of them around here, but none are familar to me so I don't know where to start.
