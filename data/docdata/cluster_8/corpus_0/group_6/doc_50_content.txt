Today I crossed the line. This afternoon (01/23/2009) I spoke with Customer Service Representative "SHANA" in your New Mexico Call Center. I was totally out of line.    Shana was even-tempered, soft spoken, polite, and professional at all times.    I, however, was rude, obnoxious, loud, and profane.    Please extend my deepest apologies to Shana. I'm sure that Shana has had her share of irate customers; and knows not to take the calls personally. But,I did cross the line when I used personal profanity towards her.    There is no excuse for my behavior. Please make the extra effort to forward my apology. Shana deserves it.    My name or account number is not necessary, as I'm sure Shana remembers the lout that I am.
