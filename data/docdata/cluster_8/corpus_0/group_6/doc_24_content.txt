Bankruptcy Lawyer: Your Final Solution When Running Out Of Options    Before rushing to a lawyer to assist you in filing for bankruptcy, you have to make sure what is bankruptcy and what is not. Only then will you have to find a bankruptcy lawyer that you can work with in filing your case. Many people rush to file for bankruptcy thinking that it will solve their financial problems. The opposite is often true. Declaring your business to be legally bankrupt, only mean that you have done everything you could and there is no way for recovery. It means being deep in debt that it will already be impossible for you to sustain the business. There are kinds and variations to bankruptcy and the legal process will depend very much on where you are coming from but the purpose is the same. Bankruptcy cases will take years to resolve. The court will determine what debts do not have to be repaid and what will be directly deducted from your income. In the interim, credit lines will be closed to you. Your credit history will be tainted and no credit institution will want to do business with you. Back taxes that you owe will still have to be paid and obligations will still be enforced like alimony and child support. When there is no resolution that is possible, finding a good bankruptcy lawyer will then be the only recourse. A good bankruptcy lawyer should be someone you can be comfortable talking with. Someone you can trust and someone who has displayed competence in handling bankruptcy. This is very important as communication between you and the lawyer must be based on trust. There have been so many instances when the client holds back on information that he thinks is not so significant only to learn later on that the piece of information that was withheld posed additional complication to the case. Withholding information from your bankruptcy lawyer pose problems where non existed before. Bankruptcy lawyers can only help the client to the extent of the knowledge that the lawyer has. It is crucial then that the client works with the lawyer. This is in the first place the client?s future that is at stake. Do not hesitate to interview the lawyer prior to retaining him. Ask the lawyer questions and a good lawyer must answer you in a language that you can understand. If you don?t, do not be afraid to clarify statements that could be ambiguous to you. Find out a bankruptcy lawyer that already has an extensive experience in handling bankruptcy cases. Whenever possible find a bankruptcy lawyer who is a specialist. Avoid the generalist, as they may not be able to help you as much. If you feel uncomfortable talking with a particular bankruptcy lawyer, find another one. You can visit the local bar association to find out their recommendation. When you visit your bankruptcy lawyer, bring a list of all the creditors that you owe, including payments to personal loans that you are not left behind and a list of all your assets and liabilities. The more information you provide the bankruptcy lawyer, the better and more accurate the recommendations he will give you. Remember that lawyers can only work as good as the information that you provide. Cooperate well in giving your lawyer the data regarding your case because you are in the best position to give those to him. You also will be the person that will either suffer or benefit from the outcome.  Robert Thatcher is a freelance publisher based in Cupertino, California.

Even though filing bankruptcy constitutes a fresh start, the fresh start doesn   t begin until ten years after your bankruptcy is discharged. In the meantime, it is possible to acquire some credit from those creditors who are friendly to those who have filed bankruptcy.

After you have put down the specified amount, your bankruptcy attorney will then look at creditor statements, etc. to ensure your amount of debt exceeds the specified amount that enables you to file bankruptcy. Once this is determined, your attorney will fill out a petition and by law you will be required to attend a credit counseling session.  Unfortunately, if you are not happy with the attorney performing your bankruptcy, they may not refund your money.

It may seem the answer to all your prayers but bankruptcy is only able to solve certain debt issues. Remember, if you have filed for bankruptcy you may find it difficult to obtain credit in the future unless your bankruptcy has been cleared, or discharged for a number of years. Bankruptcy is very good for wiping out credit card debt. Unless you have a special secured credit card, your credit card balance is an unsecured debt. That means that the credit card company has no hold on anything that belongs to you if you do not pay back your debt. This is specifically the kind of debt that bankruptcy is designed to remove. Apart from credit card debt, you may have other unsecured debts, and bankruptcy can eradicate these as well. However, bankruptcy will not discharge your obligations to some other kinds of debts, including child support, alimony, tax debts, student loans, and any secured debts. If you are reading this then the chances are that you are considering filing for bankruptcy. Your debts have got to the point where you cannot afford the monthly payments that your creditors are demanding. However, there are numerous bankruptcy alternatives. The most important thing is not to panic and to sit down and look at your financial situation. If you reach the stage where you are in so much debt that you are considering bankruptcy then there are a number of measures that you can take to avoid bankruptcy. Firstly, you should cut up all of your credit cards. This may seem drastic, but it is the only way to avoid bankruptcy by guaranteeing that you do not increase your level of debt by charging more onto your credit cards. All lenders would prefer to receive some money rather than none at all and when you file for bankruptcy a number of your creditors will receive little or none of the proceeds. This is especially the case with your unsecured loans, such as credit cards. You should contact all of the people that you owe money to and explain the situation. Most will work out a repayment schedule with you as a bankruptcy alternative, giving you longer to pay off what you owe and sometimes even freezing the interest.

This is not true.   Filing for bankruptcy is a decision that should not be made without first seeking the qualified counsel of a Texas bankruptcy lawyer. A Texas bankruptcy lawyer can help you decide which form of bankruptcy is best for you. Under Chapter 13 a debtor is given the ability to liquidate assets and set up a debt repayment plan that best suits them. This can give you the relief you need from high credit bills and other debt.  The first step under chapter 13 is to receive credit counseling and budget analysis from an approved counseling service. This step can be omitted in a few situations of hardship, but most will have to undergo the counseling. It is an important step that must be taken to prevent your case from being dismissed.
