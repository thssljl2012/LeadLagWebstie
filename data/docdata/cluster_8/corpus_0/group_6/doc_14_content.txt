May the gods destroy their branches and salt the Earth where they once stood, along with all branches of H&amp;R Bloch.They've lost our short sale paperwork.I don't know if the poor buyer's going to be able to get the house or not.  At this point, it's seriously looking like Countrywide would rather that we went into foreclosure than sold the house for some form of money.  In fact, I am now convinced that they are hell bent on destroying our credit.  I have no clue why they feel this way.  I have no clue why Bank of America is allowing this kind of incompetence to continue, but then my opinion of BofA wasn't very high to start with.I am...upset.I am debating mailing them the keys right now and saying, fuck it.  Apparently, trying to do the right thing and deal with them in fairness and directness is just completely wrong and I'm in Wonderland where everything is backwards, having tea with the White Queen and waiting for the Red Queen to strike off my head.We're all mad here.I don't know why I'm bothering anymore.  My credit is trashed for the next five to seven years because of this now, all for trying to deal with them as they requested.  This is why there's a financial crisis.  Because the banks don't give a shit about anything.  Not their stockholders, not their loan holders, not their customers.  I don't know what they care about, but my suspicion is that it amounts to nothing.  I'm filing another complaint with the California AG's office and I'm filing a complaint with both Countrywide and BofA.  It won't do a damn thing, but at least I'll be on record.  So.  What's good in the world, people?  Someone send me pictures of kittens.
