I&amp;nbsp;have discovered three things today.&amp;nbsp; First, Verizon Wireless will, eventually, refund your security deposit.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp;got a check in the mail yesterday.&amp;nbsp; I didn't know it was a check, so I tossed it with the bill and ignored it.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;nbsp;opened it today.I&amp;nbsp;also discovered that I&amp;nbsp;am, in fact, sick.&amp;nbsp; I've been pretending otherwise for a week, but today I&amp;nbsp;woke up and my body protested on about seven different levels, enough so that I&amp;nbsp;called in and went back to sleep.Finally, if you have a citibank checking account but no nearby Citibank ATMs in your area, you can deposit checks with a US&amp;nbsp;Bank ATM instead and it works.&amp;nbsp; That is much better than mailing checks halfway across the country.It's been that kind of day.&amp;nbsp; Plus side, I'm finally a bit ahead on my finances.&amp;nbsp; I've been coupling being a frugal ass with various bonuses overtime, and so forth that I&amp;nbsp;have a small chunk set aside for &amp;quot;In case&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;instead of my standard &amp;quot;well this sucks&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;method of dealing with financial problems.&amp;nbsp; We'll see how that works.
