Well, it was 400 miles' worth of jumping at every noise that came from the car, the cars around us, the road, the things in the back seat of the car, the people in the front seat of the car, and my fevered imagination, but we are in Terra Haute, Indiana, and St. Robinson is with us. The transplant has happened, and he is back in our arms. The lady at the Saturn service desk told me that said engine would probably continue to smoke every time I turned it on for a while, but as long as I know not to panic when I smell something burning, I'm fine.Amusingly enough, I spent $$$$ today on the car and $$$ on the final hotel bill, only to have my card rejected when I went to buy $10 of gas. At first I thought I might've tripped the theft protection, since I rarely make purchases as much as $$$ and never $$$$, but the nice lady with Bank of America customer service told me that actually, I just busted my spending limit, which only allows me to buy so much in a rolling 24-hour period. Would you like us to temporarily raise that limit? she asked. Yes, please, I said. You can raise it as high as $15,500, she told me, and it'll stay that way for the next couple of weeks! I told her that if she could bump it up by the extravagant margin of $500 just long enough for me to get home by tomorrow night, that would be sufficient to my needs. And thus, I was magically made able to buy gas again.Anyway, the car is back together, and we've settled for a night in a Super 8 with crappy wireless access, so we'll see if this gets posted at all! But whatever, man, we are currently limping our way northeastward, finally very nearly home.
