The finanical Tsuanami have taken a big toll on everyone&#8217;s life. Especially the big leg down in aug, oct and nov (start). Nov,Dec,Jan was a good months for me, but still very bumpy, and choppy. It is a trader markets with lotsa guts when Citibank and Boa are on the verge of collapse (jan 2009). Currently, i&#8217;m only long A-shares at 1800. So the big question is&#8230;has the bottom hit yet? This boils down the performance of the USA president, will history repeat in 1930s when the new president edict new measures to save the economy? He was the greatest president of all times, only one that held 4 terms. One have to study the policys his economic team have come out with. For World Economy to really restore to the good old days, major technology improvement by x country to boost energy efficiency and productivity perhaps.
