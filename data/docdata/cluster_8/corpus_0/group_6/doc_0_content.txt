                We tried to get a "bridge loan" when we tried to buy our house in 1995; the local bank refused saying we couldn't cover it.  That made sense;  don't loan to those who can't afford a loan.Now,  "Bank of America"  begged for a "bailout"  because they had either given loans to folks who couldn't afford them or bought loans from such dead beats "financially challenged debtees".  Then,  fucking "Bank of American" went and bought an investment company with the "loan" meant to give them working funds;  said working funds were intended for BofA to be able to loan money. Then,  fBoA begged for more "loans" so they could loan money.What I bunch of assholes!!!(Did I mention that a year after we paid off our house loan,  fBoA dropped our home equity loan limit by 80%?  I had to write a protest letter to one of their Vice Presidents questioning the "facts" in their letter in order to get the limits  restored.  Not that it matters,  we haven't needed to take out a loan on our home equity line of credit for several years and don't anticipate doing so any time soon...
