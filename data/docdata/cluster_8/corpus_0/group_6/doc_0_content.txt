(1)                  Now that nearly half of that money is in the hands of big banks, how is it being spent?                  No one's talking.          The banks are refusing to say how our taxpayer dollars are being used.(2)&amp;nbsp; All we do know for sure is that the original problem that caused the economic collapse ?housing foreclosures ?is getting worse, not better.&amp;nbsp;                  Tell the top banking industry recipients of bailout funds that "we the people" have a right to know how our money is being used!&amp;nbsp;          Foreclosures are continuing to have a devastating effect on thousands of communities by draining local funding away from services like police, fire and rescue, and even public schools.&amp;nbsp;The banks have an obligation to use the bailout funds -- which are public money -- to stop the hemorrhaging.&amp;nbsp;          Citigroup has received $45 billion.&amp;nbsp; JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo have gotten $25 billion each.&amp;nbsp; At the very least, they should provide detailed answers to questions about how these funds are being spent.&amp;nbsp;A little transparency is not too much to ask.          Please join us in demanding a bailout that is fair, transparent and that serves the public interest by helping struggling Americans.                  Send a message to the big banks today.&amp;nbsp;Demand answers about where our money has gone.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;          And stay tuned: The Financial Services Committee in the U.S. House will be holding hearings soon at which the CEOs of these&amp;nbsp;corporations are expected to testify.&amp;nbsp;We'll let you know how you can impact those hearings!

In recognition of this, the [law] included specific language for the Secretary to address the housing crisis. Unfortunately, the Treasury has not taken sufficient actions as communities and families across the country continue to be devastated by foreclosures. Loan modification efforts are failing." ?nbsp;Statement of Sen. Christopher S.
