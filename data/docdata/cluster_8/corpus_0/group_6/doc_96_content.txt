Treasury, Bank of America agree on bailout  Bank of America Corp. had already been granted $25 billion from the bailout fund that Congress passed on Oct. 3, but found it needed more as it sought to cope with rising losses related to its acquisition of Merrill Lynch.   I realize that the tentacles of these mega-bank things reach deeply into everyone's everyday lives. I realize that if they fail, the whole country is doomed to living on a budget.  But BoA charges me a $2 fee if I make a transaction with an actual teller rather than a machine. They have the nerve to ask taxpayers to bail out their sinking ship!  Screw you, BoA.
