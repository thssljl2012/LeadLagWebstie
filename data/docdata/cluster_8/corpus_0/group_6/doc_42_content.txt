Last month, Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell announced a spending and hiring freeze.  Then he hired former legislator Dan Surra, a Democrat from Elk County, to DCNR tourism position at the tune of $95,000.00 - a salary which exceeds anything Surra made as a legislator. Yesterday, the Governor announced that the state budget was facing such a shortfall that lay-offs in state government were imminent. The howls from state workers was immediate.  The Governor&#8217;s response was that he wanted to hear &#8220;no whining&#8221; from state workers who will lose their jobs. Staff at the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources will lose their jobs.  But not Dan Surra.  The voters in his legislative district may have voted him out, but they (and the rest of us in PA) are stuck with him and his unconscionable $95,000 salary. Over at the Bank of America, former CEO John Thain has his own set of detractors.  Seems that during his final days as CEO, he moved up the date for the awarding of bonuses to executives.  Bonuses of somewhere in excess of $3 billion.  Yeah.  Billion, as in with a B. Concurrent with the issuance of the massive bonuses, Thain &amp; Co. was telling the federal government that the soon-to-be-acquired Merrill Lynch was losing &#8220;an unexpected&#8221; $15 billion for the 4th quarter and that additional bailout money was required so that the acquisition could be finalized.   Seems that the good financial people working for Uncle Sam did not do due diligence on Thain&#8217;s claim.  Or they knew but kept their eyes, ears and mouths shut.  Yet another example of Bush, Bernanke and Paulsen playing their own version of the 3 Blind Mice.  At our expense. But that&#8217;s not all.   During the months since the US has been deep in economic crisis, Thain also had his CEO offices redecorated with the help of a not-so-inexpensive designer to the tune of just under $1 million.  Need a wastebasket?  Thain did.  But unlike the rest of us, the $30.00 buckets at Target weren&#8217;t good enough.  He needed the $1,400.00 parchment version.  $1,400 for a wastebasket.  Unfreakingbeleivable. Someone should make Bank of America return the $3 billion used to pay out the unearned bonuses.   They at least had the good sense to fire Thain.    Too bad the people of Pennsylvania cannot fire their CEO for equally bad financial judgment.
