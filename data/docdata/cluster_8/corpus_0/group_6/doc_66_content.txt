     I've covered the evils of debt on this blog for quite a while now. My hope is to let every reader know that, contrary to what we've all&amp;#0160;been taught, debt hinders a career in the arts. Many people harbor the belief that, like a winning lottery ticket, a debt &amp;quot;investment&amp;quot; will pay off someday. But too often, artists and writers end up broke and bitter, stuck to a crappy day job with no future. I know because I've been there. &amp;#0160; When I moved to NYC in 2001, I had very little credit card debt. By the time I left in 2004, I was deep in debt. It took a long time for me to&amp;#0160;reject the idea that debt was necessary. Or cool.  &amp;#0160; So I began to work at paying off my credit cards. It was daunting at first. To expedite matters, I got a credit union card with a low interest rate. I transferred as much of my balance as possible and then worked on paying it off.  &amp;#0160; I ended 2008 with one card paid off. I have one more to go. &amp;#0160; And so 2009 begins with this: I've been rate-jacked. &amp;#0160; Citibank raised my interest rate by almost 10 percent, making my minimum payment more than&amp;#0160;my student loan payment. Friends, that's alot of money. I was so angry, I couldn't sleep last night. &amp;#0160; But I'm lucky. Because some of my debt is already paid off, I was able to transfer half of that Citibank balance onto my low interest credit card. For the next few months, I will work with all of my might, so that by April I will be able to say goodbye to Citibank forever. After that, the low interest card will be paid off quickly, again. &amp;#0160; And then, no more credit debt. &amp;#0160; This afternoon, I spent time researching the concept of rate-jacking. Citibank isn't the only culprit. It seems to be all the rage with credit card companies.  &amp;#0160; If I was in a different situation, I might be screwed. I have no idea how people are barely scraping by, or those who have been laid off, are handling this problem. But it is a problem, a big one.  &amp;#0160; So let this be a warning to you: True change comes from within, and cleaning up your financial life is one way to live that change.
