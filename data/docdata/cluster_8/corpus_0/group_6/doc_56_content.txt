     New US President Barack Obama is signalling further steps to establish a huge, government funded bad bank to buy toxic assets and help stem the credit crisis. US Treasury Secretary designate Tim Geithner says Obama will set out a full recovery plan for the US economy within weeks. Geithners key aim was to get banks lending to one another and the wider market in order to heal the countrys economic problems. Meanwhile, the huge bailout of US banks remains controversial, with the Service Employees International (SEIU) launching a campaign to make Bank of America pay back their bailout. The union says the bank is continuing the same unethical business practices that led to the financial crisis in the first place, and is particularly critical of corporate largesse such as private jets when the banks staff are on low pay and have minimal healthcare insurance.
