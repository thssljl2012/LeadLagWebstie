by Rebecca Cole  President Barack Obama today met with several banking executives to issue a warning that deceptive credit card marketing practices and the gouging of consumers through constant fee hikes will not be tolerated.  Obama underscored the importance of credit cards as a convenient source of credit for individuals and small businesses and said that the industry should be preserved.  Yet Obama issued a stern warning about the abuses which he said credit card companies have inflicted on consumers: "You know, people finding themselves starting off with a low rate, and next thing they know their interest rates have doubled, fees that they didn't know about but are suddenly tacked on to their bills, a whole lack of clarity and transparency" about credit card terms and conditions.                                         Worried about consumer backlash and possible congressional legislation that would add further restrictions to Federal Reserve rules implemented in December, top executives from Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Bank of America originally proposed the meeting.  But if White House economic adviser Larry Summers' remarks on the Sunday talk shows were any indication, the bankers may have received more than they bargained for in today's sit-down, which included Summers, Obama and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner.  Obama called for several key areas of reform that closely hewed to his campaign pledge to establish a "Bill of Rights" for credit card users.
