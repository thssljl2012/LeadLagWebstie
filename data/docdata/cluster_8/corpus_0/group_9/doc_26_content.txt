MounteBank, N.A. &#8220;The Friendly Bank&#8221; Member - FDIC April 22, 2009 Dear Shareholders: Since it was in all the papers, you most likely know by now that your company announced a quarterly loss of over $80 million. It&#8217;s our fifth straight quarter of reporting red ink. Coincidentally, I must admit that said losing string is correlated with the pain-dulling distilled decanter, sharing the same numerical reference, that we in top management keep handy in our bottom desk drawers these days. As is so often the case since your company began its descent from $50 per share to the present price of just over ten bucks, the e-mails and phone calls to my office have been incessant. Fortunately, my secretary intercepts the incoming land line missiles for me, so if you have phoned and been told, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, he&#8217;s not at his desk,&#8221; it may be because I am under it, having ventured to the aforementioned bottom drawer a few too many times. Be that as it may, I do read a sufficient number of your e-mails to be able to catch the drift of your ire. Naturally, you want to know why a large regional bank like ours is &#8220;puking up&#8221; (your words, not mine) losses when Wells Fargo, Citibank, and B of A have reported big profits for the quarter. Well, let me be blunt about it - they are allowed to cheat on the numbers even more than we are. You see, certain really large banks are considered &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; by the Treasury Dept. and the Federal Reserve - but, alas, your company isn&#8217;t one of them. Hence, to use Citibank as an example, the powers-that-be let Citi back-date January losses to December. Sure enough, that made the current quarter look much better it really was. Plus, Citi was permitted to book a gain on its own deteriorating debt via an accounting gimmick called, &#8220;a credit value adjustment.&#8221; Now, please, I&#8217;m just trying to let you shareholders in on the straight dope; so whatever you do, don&#8217;t go out and start telling our customers about the latter. What it essentially means is this - picture one of our hopelessly past due borrowers swaggering into one of our branches and claiming the following: &#8220;Hey, since at most I can only pay you 25% of what I owe, then the liability side of my balance sheet is reduced by that 75%. Because of this &#8216;credit value adjustment,&#8217; my financial statement is therefore now vastly &#8216;improved.&#8217; Ergo, I am - Presto! - a better credit risk, so how&#8217;s about lending me some more dough!&#8221; Of course, taking into account the many lousy loan decisions that your company has made - after all, we didn&#8217;t book the above-mentioned $80 million loss by being unadventurous in our credit committees - even we are dumbstruck at the audacity of such licentious legerdemain. Regardless, the Fed, Treasury, and a bunch of accountants gave Citi their blessings. It&#8217;s a travesty, I tell you! That is, that a mega bank got to do it and not your company! Moving on, it seems that the second most important thing on your minds is this whole concept of having the government &#8220;stress test&#8221; certain banks. Again this won&#8217;t apply to us because we aren&#8217;t big enough. Still, we find it odd that the feds haven&#8217;t even revealed to the public what such an exam really entails. I mean, various agencies snoop around your company&#8217;s affairs all the time; it&#8217;s kind of like getting a physical. It may be, therefore, that a stress test is even more invasive. I believe that your chairman, Wright Downs, who at 92 has seen just about everything, may have the best analogy. Just the other day he sagely told the rest of us in top management that if a routine visit from a regulator is like a physical, then a stress test must be like a prostate exam. Take JP Morgan, for instance. Your chairman thinks Morgan will know whether or not it passed based on the octave level of its management&#8217;s voices when the procedure is nearing completion. This is the way he put it: &#8220;The reg&#8217;lators&#8217;ll start out tellin&#8217; &#8216;em to bend over and at first they may be calmly explaining their sit&#8217;ation and soundin&#8217; real composed, vocalizin&#8217; like James Earl Jones. But when the probe gets goodn&#8217; deep they may wind up shattering wine glasses like Ella Fitzgerald. That&#8217;ll mean they failed the dadgum stress test!&#8221; Anyway, we got the point. On a more encouraging note, a brokerage company that follows your company&#8217;s stock put a positive spin on this quarter&#8217;s big negative number. &#8220;This is actually a better reporting period than would be implied by the headline number; that is, an $80,000,000 loss,&#8221; wrote Debra &#8220;Dee&#8221; Lude of our good friend, Seth Poole Securities. Sounds good to us. Moreover, employing such logic, I guess if we had blown double that amount, our prospects would be twice as good! Bless her heart, Dee is an eternal optimist and she&#8217;s still in our corner despite her ill-timed upgrade of your company&#8217;s stock early last summer. I suppose that technically her call was a good one, as her firm&#8217;s clients would have benefited if had they bought our shares back then. I mean, she did say we would &#8220;outperform&#8221; - and outperform we did! Our share price is up .006%. Furthermore, by way of her report, Seth Poole suggested to its clients that, because we are taking our write-off medicine now, we might emerge first when the economy gets kicking again. I sure hope the firm is correct, but a lot will have to do with what happens to our massive portfolio of Home Equity Lines of Credit (&#8221;HELOC&#8217;s). Regrettably, your company pitched HELOC&#8217;s like candy at an second grade Halloween party during the earlier part of this decade. By the way, since we are discussing this loan product, let me clarify some confusion regarding the correct way to pronounce its nickname. We in management prefer not to use the long vowel, as in HEE-LOCKS, but rather the short &#8220;e&#8221;, as in HELL-LOCKS. Besides, the latter carries the added benefit of describing the purgatory of holding a slew of second mortgages at a time when many banks are discovering that even their first mortgage collateral is worth far less than what the borrower owes. Last time I looked, we had HELOC&#8217;s totaling 300% or so of our capital. I&#8217;m referring to &#8220;real&#8221; equity, I should point out, not the new-fangled number we are reporting nowadays that includes our ingestion of TARP money. In any case, I guess our exposure means that, if roughly a third of those HELOC borrowers welsh, your company&#8217;s net worth shall be but a distant memory. We don&#8217;t think such a scenario will take place. Nevertheless, it is indeed a sobering thought - but not so sobering that doing away with the bottom drawer contents is being contemplated presently. Keep your fingers crossed, Jerry Rigg, Chairman
