Is the public outcry over Wall Street bonuses justified? Absolutely. Is it&#0160;grossly out of proportion to the damage done by bonuses to society? Totally. Where is this same populist outrage over the greatest scandal of American&#0160;public life - the rationing of health care by the insurance industry? Every week I hear from readers who are denied health care or forced to pay a price that&#0160;drains their&#0160;bank accounts and retirement funds. I repeat:&#0160;Where is the outrage? Here is just one&#0160;story - from a man whose pregnant wife was denied Short Term Disability even though he signed up for it. In my response, I reluctantly explain why I don't ask companies to change policies - that what we have here is a political problem calling for pitch forks and torches        Perhaps you could help.&#0160;I am at a complete loss. My wife and I had our first baby on Feb. 26th, 2009. She is an employee of&#0160;County Schools. Their annual enrollment ends on May 1st. In April of 2008, we chose the STD plan knowing we would be trying to expand our family. Apparently we are being brutally punished for have early success. We just received a call from Unum, the insurance carrier, stating the claim is being denied (!?!) because she did not have a STD policy the year prior and three months prior to the policy taking effect (10/01/08) she was receiving treatment for her condition. We concieved sometime in May after the policy had been chosen. Saw the doctor first in early July and became completely overwhelm with anger and frustration in late March of 2009. Right now, I am listing this as one of the most absurd things I have ever heard of. I worked with FMLA and STD leaves for a company in town for a few years and have never heard of anything being needed aside from the policy being effective the day the leave began (2/22/09 in our case). &#0160; Dear Reader: If I'm going to hold a company's feet to the fire to honor every sentence of its contractual obligations when they favor the consumer, in good conscience I can't turn around and ask them to waive terms when - even if punitive and draconian - they favor the company. All of this is an outrage to me that needs to be addressed politically. Health care should not be a business, it should be a right, and until that happens health insurance policies will have no more integrity and compassion than extended auto warranties. End of political rant. If you find one sentence which obligates Unum to pay this claim, let me know and I will be on them like white on rice.
