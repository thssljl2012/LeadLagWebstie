So: 1. Part of me is pleased with Obama's $500,000 cap on CEO salaries of TARP Takers.   Have some friggin' pride, execs.  If you're taking bailout money, take a salary/bonus haircut for a couple years, just so you keep my blood pressure down.  You still have huge upside on the stock options.   2. However, another part of me (and you), the taxpayer part, owns a big chunk of Bank of America.  Citi.  Wells Fargo.  Etc.   Part #2 of me does not want to lose my best execs.   Now the details aren't out yet.   And let's say they restrict this to TARP biggies. Top 50 getters.  Top 10 execs at each firm.  Out of 500 affected execs, let's say the best 100 will get raided HARD by headhunters for private equity and hedge funds. "You used to make $5++ million.  Now you get $0.5 million.  How about joining us and getting back up to big numbers?" Those bankers will get hired in ANY market.  The talent.  The kahuna.   The 400 other execs will stay for a while, til the hedge fund and private equity market bounces back.   So let's say we strip out 500 execs * $5 million they don't get to have = $250 million of compensation (Part 1 of me feels great) that DOESN'T go to the Big Shots.  It stays with the company.   Hmm...but now the folks who are steering my $145 BILLION (so far) in bank holdings are less capable.   If the departed execs are even 5% better than the "stayers" -- then Joe Taxpayer loses $7.25 BILLION. And I suspect they're a lot more than 5% better.   Slow motion. We taxpayers will save $250 million.  Limiting salaries.  Sometimes paid to jackasses.  Yay.   We taxpayers lose $7.25 billion in market value on our $145 billion (and rapidly rising) portfolio of banks, managed by lesser stewards.   What am I not understanding here?   This is a pretty expensive feel good gesture, no?
