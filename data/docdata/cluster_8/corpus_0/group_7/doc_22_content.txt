In late 1992, when Bank of America's stock price was the same as it is today..........              Bill Clinton had recently been elected, but George H.W. Bush was still in office;      There was no such thing as an Internet browser;      It would be five years before Steve Jobs would set foot inside Apple's buildings again        In the spring of 1968, when Citi's stock price was the same as it is today..........              Lyndon Johnson was the President;      The most primitive handheld calculator was three years off;      The future author of Slope was still a chubby baby
