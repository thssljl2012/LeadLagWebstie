Executives might think twice before asking the government to bail them out - the Obama administration is set to announce new rules that will limit executive pay for companies receiving "exceptional assistance" from a bailout. The restrictions will most likely prohibit severance payments to a corporation's top-55 executives, and also cut bonus pools by 40 percent from the 2007 level.  In reaction to news that Bank of America spent $10 million on its NFL sponsorship and that Wall Street gave itself $18.4 billion in bonuses last year, many of you said that the government shouldn't give these corporations a blank check and then complain about how they use the money.  Do you think limiting executive pay is a smart way to make sure taxpayer money is spent responsibly?  Source          Should the Government Limit Executive Pay?      Yes.
