 Earlier in the week, I wrote about Bank of America throwing a $10 million Superbowl extravaganza&#8211;a sickening misuse of the $45 billion they received in bailout funds. Well, another major bailout recipient, Wells Fargo, also had plans for a lavish corporate event, this time in Vegas. Wells Fargo, which received $25 billion in taxpayer money after being one of the top writers of subprime mortgages, actually tried to defend their retreat first before canceling it amid criticism from lawmakers and investigators alike. Fortunately, President Obama is taking a page from the Bernie Sanders&#8217;s playbook, announcing plans to put a $500,000 pay cap on senior executive pay at banks taking bailout funds.  As David Sirota points out at OpenLeft, this is a huge reversal of the Obama administration&#8217;s previous plan to oppose limits on executive pay, and a major win for progressives pushing calling for the President to take a stronger stand on this issue.
