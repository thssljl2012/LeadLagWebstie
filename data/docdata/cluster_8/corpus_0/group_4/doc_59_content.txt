      Citigroup, which has suffered from some pretty bad management, is getting bailed out again.  They had already gotten $25 billion from the government under the bailout plan.For those of you who have missed it, the first round of bailouts went like this:  Instead of buying up toxic assets as planned, the government just gave the banks big wads of our money.  The idea was that if Bush/Paulson/Pelosi gave them lots of taxpayer money, they would make more loans.  Of course, the Bush Administration (the sole administrator of the funds) didn't actually require that the banks, you know, make loans-- they just gave them our money, in huge amounts.  Not surprisingly, the banks in large part are just keeping the money or using it for other things rather than making loans with it.  Sigh.  Bank of America took billions of our tax funds, for example.  Did they then make loans at a more rapid rate?  Nope.  Instead, they spent $7 billion to buy a stake in a Chinese bank.  Yep-- we give tax money to the bank, they invest in China.  Good work, people!Remember when Ronald Reagan attacked welfare because it gave people small amounts of money while requiring no accountability?  Most people, in retrospect, think the reforms he and Clinton made were probably good moves in many ways.  Apparently, though, we still think it is ok to give away gigantic amounts of money to irresponsible corporations without requiring any accountability.  Meanwhile, the automakers are figuring that if the banks can get our money without making loans, they should be able to get our cash without selling us a car.  Their plan?  In what seems like an idiotic passive-aggressive reaction to the criticism of their fancy private jet travel last week, the auto executives are going to return to DC in a carpool.
