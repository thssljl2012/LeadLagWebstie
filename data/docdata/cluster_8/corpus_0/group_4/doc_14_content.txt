 Obama&amp;#8217;s Chief Of Staff Favours Compulsory Military Service for 18-25s Obama&amp;#8217;s              Change Leaves By The Back Door By              Tom Eley  07 November,              2008 WSWS.org Three              days after Barack Obama&amp;#8217;s election victory, the initial moves by the              president-elect to prepare his administration already show that his              policies will be determined not by popular expectations, but by the              domestic and foreign policy interests of the American financial and              corporate elite. Obama and              Democratic congressional leaders are well aware that these policiesfurther              measures to secure the social interests and personal wealth of the              financial aristocracy at public expense and the continued use of military              violence in the Middle East and Central Asiaclash with the              will of the electorate, which sought to reverse these policies by              sweeping the Republicans out of power. That is why the Democrats are              seeking to dampen expectations of a serious change of course. The personnel              of Obama&amp;#8217;s transition team and his first major appointment stand in              obvious contradiction to his campaign rhetoric about &amp;#8220;change,&amp;#8221;              &amp;#8220;new politics,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;building a movement from the ground              up.&amp;#8221; The individuals selected are all fixtures of the political              establishment, with close ties to powerful corporate and financial              interests. Obama&amp;#8217;s              transition team, which will assist in assembling his cabinet, is headed              by John Podesta, former chief of staff to Bill Clinton and one of              Washington&amp;#8217;s most successful corporate lobbyists. Co-chairing the              transition team are Valerie Jarrett, a long-time Obama advisor, Chicago              real estate executive and influential figure within the Chicago Democratic              Party machine, and Pete Rouse, a Washington insider and Obama&amp;#8217;s senate              chief of staff. (See: &amp;#8220;A closer look at Obama&amp;#8217;s transition team&amp;#8221;). Obama&amp;#8217;s              first appointee is Rahm Emanuel, who will serve as his chief of staff.              The Illinois Congressman is a leading member of the right-wing Democratic              Leadership Council. While running for Congress in 2002, he supported              Bush&amp;#8217;s bill to authorize military force against Iraq. A former investment              banker, he has close ties to financial interests and is one of the              biggest recipients of campaign cash from banks and investment firms. Sources              close to Obama have leaked names on the list of candidates for the              position of treasury secretaryno doubt as a means of reassuring              Wall Street. Included are former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker,              former Clinton treasury secretary and current Citigroup executive              Robert Rubin, another former Clinton treasury secretary, Lawrence              Summers, and Timothy Geithner, the New York Federal Reserve Bank president. All of              these individuals played leading roles in the deregulation of the              banks and investment houses that facilitated the super-profits and              massive CEO compensation packages of the 1990s and first half of the              current decade, and contributed to the financial collapse that is              now plunging the US and the rest of the world into the deepest recession              since the 1930s. Geithner              has played a central role in the government bailout of Wall Street              banks and other major firms, such as insurance conglomerate AIG and              the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. As Federal              Reserve chief under Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, Volcker was responsible              for the high interest rate &amp;#8220;shock therapy&amp;#8221; which decimated              American industry in the early 1980s and led to the impoverishment              of entire regions. There is              much speculation that Obama will ask current Defense Secretary Robert              Gates to stay on in the same capacity, at least on an interim basis.              Gates recently gave a speech expanding the doctrine of &amp;#8220;pre-emptive              war&amp;#8221; to include the use of first-strike nuclear attacks. Other names              broached for the positions of defense secretary and secretary of state              include former Bush Secretary of State Colin Powell, outgoing Republican              Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, and Anthony Lake, who as Clinton&amp;#8217;s              national security advisor played a key role in organizing the US-NATO              war against Yugoslavia. Obama&amp;#8217;s              actions since Election Day have been calculated to signal to the ruling              elite his readiness to defend their interests and not be swayed by              the will of the electorate. To underscore his intention to seek a              consensus with the defeated and discredited Republican minority, he              will meet on Monday with Bush. The traditional White House meeting              between a president-elect and the outgoing president normally takes              place much later in the transition period between administrations. To demonstrate              that his first priority is shoring up the major banks, Obama&amp;#8217;s first              post-Election Day meeting will be held today with his top economic              policy advisers. The meeting will include Volcker, Rubin and Summers,              along with billionaire investor Warren Buffett, former Clinton labor              and commerce secretaries Robert Reich and William Daley, Clinton economic              advisor Laura Tyson, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt, Time Warner Chairman              Richard Parsons, XEROX CEO Anne Mulcahy, Residence by Hyatt CEO Penny              Pritzker, former Bush administration Securities and Exchange Commissioner              William Donaldson, and Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm. Meanwhile,              a series of statements by leading Democratic figures have emphasized              their intention to pursue a &amp;#8220;centrist&amp;#8221; policyby which              they mean a conventional, i.e., right-wing, policy. Speaker              of the House Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, spelled this out              in no uncertain terms on Wednesday, advising Obama that he must &amp;#8220;bring              people together to reach consensus&amp;#8221; on issues like the economy              and the war. &amp;#8220;A new president must govern from the middle,&amp;#8221;              she said. Leon Panetta,              former chief of staff to Bill Clinton, said, &amp;#8220;He&amp;#8217;s got to lower              some expectations, indicate the limits he&amp;#8217;s confronting.&amp;#8221; A basic              premise of the talk about lowering expectations and delaying making              good on campaign promises for health care reform, middle class tax              cuts and other social measures is the claim that massive increases              in the budget deficit preclude such outlays. Of course, the worsening              budget crisis is the direct result of the allocation of more than              $2 trillion in taxpayer money to bail out the banks, with the auto              companies and other industries lining up for similar government handouts. No Democratic              leader has explained why there are unlimited taxpayer funds available              for the banks, but no money to address the increasingly desperate              economic situation facing the working class, including millions of              home foreclosures, soaring utility shut-offs, collapsing retirement              accounts and mounting layoffs. The media              has joined in the effort to dampen expectations. Newsweek warns, &amp;#8220;Obama              Won&amp;#8217;t Meet Everybody&amp;#8217;s Expectations.&amp;#8221; The San Francisco Chronicle              explains, &amp;#8220;Surely, President-Elect Barack Obama must prepare              his supporters for the difficult circumstances that he, and this country,&amp;#8221;              must undergo. Yesterday&amp;#8217;s              New York Times published an article, &amp;#8220;Obama Aides Tamp Down Expectations,&amp;#8221;              describing Obama&amp;#8217;s efforts to &amp;#8220;temper hopes that he would be              able to solve the nation&amp;#8217;s problems.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;The economic crisis&amp;#8221;              the Times notes, &amp;#8220;will certainly complicate Mr. Obama&amp;#8217;s more              ambitious domestic efforts.&amp;#8221; On the              same day, under the headline &amp;#8220;Next Administration Shows Signs              It will Seek Middle Ground with Business on Thorny Issues,&amp;#8221; the              Wall Street Journal reassured the moneyed elite that in an Obama administration,              &amp;#8220;a bill that would make it easier for unions to organize workers,              efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, and a slew of contemplated              taxes will likely take a back seat.&amp;#8221; The article continued, &amp;#8220;Several              of Mr. Obama&amp;#8217;s top economic advisers, including former Federal Reserve              Chairman Paul Volcker, billionaire investor Warren Buffett, and former              Treasury Secretary Robert Rubinare moderates and reassuring              figures to the business community.&amp;#8221; Obama&amp;#8217;s              first moves as president-elect have underscored some basic political              facts. First, there is a fundamental contradiction between the hopes              and aspirations of the vast majority of people who voted for him out              of anger a...
