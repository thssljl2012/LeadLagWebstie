We have 2 credit cards. A Bank of America one and a CitiRewards one.  Pretty much just use the CitiRewards one, since we get cash back on it.We pay it off in full every month, so interest rates have not been a concern.But I did find humour in receiving a 'Notice of Change in Terms and Right to Opt Out' letter from them today.Wow, they are upping the APR to 19.99%, Cash Advance APR to 21.99%, and a 3% 'Transaction Fee for Foreign Purchases'!Dang!!Glad we don't need to rely on credit card balances!!
