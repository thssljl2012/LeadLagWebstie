I currently have Boobies on my work computer. - GET BACK IN THE KITCHEN, BITCH - Western Warehouse is closing. ALL OF THEM. That's just one of several business I've read about closing, but that one in particular made me go "aw, man." - Clinton Assholes Fabricated the Initial SOS Offer I KNEW THAT SHIT SEEMED SCREWY! God, I hate Hilary Clinton. I really really do. - After Citibank, Bank of America may be going tits up next. you know, I really hate that half the time I post really depressing economic news, but jesus christ, this shit's getting retarded. - Russian Professor Says U.S. Will Break Up After Economic Crisis .
