Everyone is going to the federal trough for bailout money now. It&amp;#8217;s like a game of musical chairs; once the government starts playing the bailout tune, everyone scrambles to get in on it lest they be the company that was foolish enough to attempt to survive through normal means, i.e., trimming operations, greater efficiency and, if necessary, bankruptcy. The list of industries seeking bailout money has grown to absurd proportions. For example, the following entities are now being considered for bailouts: 1. Credit card companies. 2. The auto industry. 3. The City of Detroit (not an industry, but they always have their hands out). And this is after the government already overstepped and decided to prop up AIG, which mainly deals in automobile insurance. I understood the need for a bailout of the credit markets because every other aspect of the economy &amp;#8212; from GE to a local restaurant &amp;#8212; is directly affected by a lack of credit. Using some government money to get the credit markets moving was at least a plausible way of preventing the economic crisis from spiraling out of control. However, when the government starts to prop up individual companies and sectors to prevent layoffs and bankruptcies, then we&amp;#8217;re in serious trouble. A key part of the American economy has always been our general willingness to allow companies to go through hard times, even if that harms workers and investors in the short-term. We haven&amp;#8217;t socialized risk. This is why American recessions are usually short, whereas in Europe and Asia, where they lack the gumption to allow the market to work itself out, recessions tend to be much longer and more painful. If we are weak and try to bail our way out of this, we may be in for a long haul indeed.
