So for some reason, I had a bunch of small bills and decided to go to a bank to get the money changed into large bills.  My bank is kind of far away, so I went to Bank of America.  No go.  For some reason, Bank of America will only make change for people with accounts.What?Why on earth is that a policy?  I can see not cashing checks for people without accounts, because people can try to cash fake checks.  But refusing to make change?  I had the correct amount of cash in my hand!  Why refuse to make change?So, in summary, I think Bank of America is stupid.
