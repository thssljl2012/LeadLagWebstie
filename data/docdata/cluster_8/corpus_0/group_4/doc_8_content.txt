I got a generic ad in the mail from Nationwide Insurance the other day.  On the cover of the envelope?  An admonition to the postmaster:"Please deliver before their life changes again."And what?  The whirlwind turbulence of their life renders a need for your insurance company's services obsolete?  The ratio of uninsured to insured begins to tip civilization as we know it into crisis?  Monkeys spontaneously generate out of old wire coat hangers?  (And FYI: You're pretty much too late to do anything about the first two on that list.)Seriously.Chill out already.
