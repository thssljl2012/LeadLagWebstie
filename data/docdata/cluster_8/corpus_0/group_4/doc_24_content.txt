Boy, oh boy, you sure know what you're gonna tell your niece's husband come Thanksgiving Day.&amp;nbsp; Back in September, when the whole family had gathered to celebrate a couple of birthdays, the discussion landed on the economic woes our nation was slipping into, and your niece's husband started in on that neoconservative, revisionist history that asserts that the only thing that ended the Great Depression was World War II.&amp;nbsp; Despite the fact that the New Deal gave millions of Americans jobs when jobs were next to impossible to find, thereby saving them from complete ignominy, you niece's husband, a recent college graduate steeped in neoconservative and libertarian garbage, really believes that World War II, which started for the United States in 1941, ended the Great Depression--which ended by most accounts in 1938.&amp;nbsp;  And, well, here we are, two months down the line from that sunny September Sunday and economic things and scary surprises&amp;nbsp;are looking more dire than ever.&amp;nbsp; In fact the words Great Depression are re-entering the punditocracy's lexicon like nothing stopping it, and people, including members of your immediate family, are getting both frightened and worried.&amp;nbsp; But remember: According to the reigning neoconservative and libertarian economic notions, government intervention isn't going to do a damned bit of good.&amp;nbsp; Instead, according to neoconservative numbskulls and libertarian wack-jobs, we should just sit back and let the economy correct itself.&amp;nbsp; At what cost to the well-being of millions of people?&amp;nbsp; Oddly, the numbskulls and wack-jobs don't have answers for that question.&amp;nbsp;  Back to what you're gonna say to your niece's husband on Thanksgiving Day.&amp;nbsp; Almost surely, he's gonna start in on the New Deal and "remind" everyone that the New Deal was a totally inconsequential blip in history that has been made too much of by those "goddamned liberals" and their sops.&amp;nbsp; Only World War II was able to end the Great Depression, he'll say.&amp;nbsp; To which you'll reply: Well, maybe another world war will get us out of this mess!&amp;nbsp; Whadda'ya think?&amp;nbsp; Ready to grab an M-16 and start training in your backyard for war with the People's Republic of China?&amp;nbsp;  That retort oughta shut&amp;nbsp;your niece's husband&amp;nbsp;up.&amp;nbsp; After all, if there were a horrific world conflict, your niece's husband would be of draft age.&amp;nbsp; That's right.&amp;nbsp; He'd be on his way to the Chinese front in no time.&amp;nbsp; Helping, of course, to end America's economic woes in the only way possible: violent conflict.&amp;nbsp; Can you imagine that?&amp;nbsp; Using war as an antidote to economic woes?&amp;nbsp; As if it hasn't been tried before.&amp;nbsp; After all, well, can anybody say Iraq?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Cranking up what's left of the American military-industrial complex to pump money and munitions into the market.&amp;nbsp;  Yes, your niece's husband would be slogging through the mud and rice paddies of the People's Republic of China, more than likely thinking about market forces and&amp;nbsp;savage capitalism.&amp;nbsp; While dodging machine gun fire.&amp;nbsp; Out there, in the trenches, defending savage capitalism.&amp;nbsp; And you?&amp;nbsp; You'd be an "infirm refugee" heaving what was left of your belongings out of Dallas, Texas, which naturally would be a center of urban warfare--even though right now the only warfare that enjoins Dallas is, well, urbane warfare.&amp;nbsp;  Around the same time as your niece's husband's comment about how only a world war could end an economic downturn, a libertarian lackey you know insisted that he wants Wall Street to fall and American industry to crater.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; Because Americans are soft and spoiled and complacent and lazy whiners who don't deserve anything better, he asserted.&amp;nbsp; Boldly.&amp;nbsp; As if, when the economic downturn results in bread lines and large-scale unemployment, he, in all his wisdom, won't be affected one iota.&amp;nbsp; You know why?&amp;nbsp; Because.&amp;nbsp; Just because.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Besides, he said, the market can correct itself.&amp;nbsp; That's right.&amp;nbsp; The market, which apparently is more intelligent than any man alive, knows exactly what it's doing.&amp;nbsp;  Let's see.&amp;nbsp; The news this morning was pretty morose and morbid, now wasn't it?&amp;nbsp; Yesterday, the stock market, which has been hovering around 8,000 for a couple of weeks, about half the level it was 18 months ago, dropped sharply by 455 points.&amp;nbsp; Credit once again siezed up.&amp;nbsp; Citicorp, J. P. Morgan-Chase and Bank of America are teetering on the brink of insolvency.&amp;nbsp; The leaders of the Big Three&amp;nbsp;American automakers flew into Washington with&amp;nbsp;their hands out, asking and practically begging for money to bail them out of their own credit crises.&amp;nbsp;And what's the Bush Administration doing about all this?&amp;nbsp;  Nothing.&amp;nbsp; Zip.&amp;nbsp; Zilch.&amp;nbsp; Nada.&amp;nbsp;  By doing nothing, our sagely incompetent presidential administration is expressing "faith in the market."&amp;nbsp; Faith that "the market will correct itself."&amp;nbsp; And as for the people who are starting to get hit--hard!--by the economic fall-out?&amp;nbsp; What about them?&amp;nbsp;  Oh.&amp;nbsp; Don't worry.&amp;nbsp; They're only "the help."&amp;nbsp; After all, the Bush Administration pushed through a $700 billion package to help&amp;nbsp;multibillionaire hedge fund managers recoup their losses as if it was the most important act in the history of the nation.&amp;nbsp; Of course, those guys who were the main recipients of an outrageously large Wall Street bailout are the same guys Bush &amp;amp; Co. would&amp;nbsp;most likely meet at local cocktail parties, and Bush &amp;amp; Co. wouldn't wanna be snubbed by billionaries during a Washington or New York or Connecticut happy hour, now would they?&amp;nbsp; Which&amp;nbsp;kind of goes to show you how incestious the relationship between "market forces" and Washington's Do Nothing Contingent really is.&amp;nbsp; Nobel-Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, in today's New York Times, much more politely than you ever would, commented concisely on the interregnum and power vacuum that currently rules Washington D.C. in the final death rattle of a Lame Duck Bush Administration.&amp;nbsp; Comparing this vacuum to the late fall and winter of 1932-33, between the end of the "market faithful" Hoover Administration and FDR's acquisition of the keys to the city of Washinton, Krugman insists that these few remaining months are crucial to the fate of the American economy.&amp;nbsp; Or, even worse, the world economy.&amp;nbsp;  So.&amp;nbsp; It's a choice.&amp;nbsp; Faith in "market forces"?&amp;nbsp; Or actually doing something?&amp;nbsp; Yes, folks, the forces arrayed against the need for government intervention, those petty and in-la-la-land-born ideologues, are at it again.&amp;nbsp;  Just take a look at some of the prattle surrounding the fact that the Big Three automakers jetted down to Washington to ask for several billion dollars in order to solve some serious credit problems.&amp;nbsp; Oh, they flew in on their private jets...what's that say?&amp;nbsp; That they're economically tone-deaf?&amp;nbsp; And they offered no plan for reconstruction.&amp;nbsp; Of course, nobody said those things about the 100 million-plus Wall Street hedge fund managers&amp;nbsp;who didn't even lift a finger to get the money that kinda-sorta came their way.&amp;nbsp; And even worse, it's the same group of neoconservative Republicans who are doing all the blocking and stalling in Congress right now.&amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, the rest of the nation--otherwise known as "the help"--are pinning all their hopes on Obama.&amp;nbsp; What's Obama gonna do?&amp;nbsp; Is he gonna fix what the Bush Administration and its friends in Republican-land won't?&amp;nbsp;  Hands off, everybody!&amp;nbsp; In fact, sit on your hands.&amp;nbsp; Do nothing.&amp;nbsp; The market will take care of itself.&amp;nbsp;  Of course, you say that sarcastically.&amp;nbsp; Thinking like that is almost precisely similar to hearing the valves in your car clank and rattle and saying to yourself, Lassiez faire!&amp;nbsp; The automobile will fix itself!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Yes, the great, Godforsaken monstrosity we've come to call The Market is really nothing more than a tool, albeit one nobody understands.&amp;nbsp; Many of the mortgage derivatives dreamed up by investors were actually cooked up by computer.&amp;nbsp; They're just too intricate for the human mind to comprehend.&amp;nbsp;  So.&amp;nbsp; Get your pens out, people.&amp;nbsp; Write your Senators and Congresspeople.&amp;nbsp; Tell them: Do nothing.&amp;nbsp; Let the market take care of itself.&amp;nbsp; And if that market throws a rod, don't say you weren't warned.&amp;nbsp;  -=-=-=-=- You've been horrendously busy the last three days.&amp;nbsp; Actually, you tried writing a blog on Tuesday, and it was a masterpiece!&amp;nbsp; But, just as you were about to post it, NetZero in all of it's computer-driven wisdom, pitched you off the Internet and you lost everything.&amp;nbsp; Oh well.&amp;nbsp; You weren't mad.&amp;nbsp; Not even enraged for five minutes.&amp;nbsp; You just took the NetZeroing of your blog into account and moved on.&amp;nbsp; Which says a lot about your state of mind right now.&amp;nbsp; It's been good.&amp;nbsp; The anxiety, for all practical purposes at least, is all but gone now, and you're back to something much more closely approximating the Old Normal you used to have before you were diagnosed with leukemia a year and a half ago.&amp;nbsp; Wow.&amp;nbsp; You were thinking about that time-span yesterday, as you sat in your Gilda's Club-sponsored cancer survivors support group and listened to people telling their stories.&amp;nbsp; You're almost a year in remission now, and you're feeling pretty good.&amp;nbsp; You're just hoping it lasts.&amp;nbsp; Which is always part of the problem with cancer, the gift that keeps on giving: You never know when the so-called Other Shoe is gonna drop and you're gonna have to start all over again with intensive chemotherapy treatments and hospitalizations and all of the uproar and panic and anxiety of that.&amp;nbsp;  Despite that uncertain sense of waiting, you went t...
