There's not much worse than finding out you have no money. Bills to pay, gas to buy, food to purchase and...nothing. This happened to me.I'm not a rich man. I live mostly paycheck to paycheck, pay my bills on time and don't have credit cards. I do invest in a 401k, but besides that, have no savings. I am the very definition of living within my means.So when, after trying to pull $60 for a night of drinking, I discovered that I was overdrawn, I was confused. Not angry, not yet.I called my bank immediately. They informed me of a $1300 charge in Alabama (yes, I live in Arizona) that had posted at 1:45 p.m. on Halloween. I'm fucking irate. IRATE. That charge, coupled with gas, food and some other minor expenses, wiped out my account.When I was with Bank of America, my card was always shut off after a charge that doubled or tripled my usual charge average. So what did Chase do when a charge appeared on my card that quadrupled my highest transaction to date?Not a goddamn thing. Nothing whatsoever.Sure, if I had had fraud protection they would have warned me of this. I thought I signed up  for it when I opened an account, but if I didn't, why the hell would they have not included it? I have to ask for my bank to protect me from fraudulent charges? In a time when computers can do nearly anything, this isn't automatic?Chase sucks. Anyone know a better bank?
