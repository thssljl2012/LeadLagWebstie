Crooks are now able to insert a card reader INTO BANK ATM machines. These &amp;#8220;Skimmers&amp;#8221; read your card info, but they can&amp;#8217;t get your PIN number. The only way they can get your PIN number is by either installing a little camera that looks down at the number pad, or by looking over your shoulder. So, be VERY careful when entering your PIN number. Look for anything that doesn&amp;#8217;t look normal on or over the ATM card slot. Also, use your body to block ANYONE or any cars nearby. If they can&amp;#8217;t get your PIN, they can&amp;#8217;t steal your money! Here are some more articles with pictures&amp;#8230; http://www.snopes.com/fraud/atm/atmcamera.asp This happened in Huntington Beach at a Bank Of America ATM!!! http://www.ocregister.com/articles/macdonald-card-atm-2220254-fullerton-numbers Stay alert! George  p.s. Here&amp;#8217;s another tip: Never use your ATM card unless you have to. I always use my Credit Card. If the crooks get any money, let it come from the Credit Card and not your CHECKING ACCOUNT! (Just be sure to PAY IT IN FULL each month!)
