CHICAGO &amp;#8212; A day after Illinois residents voted down a referendum on a constitutional convention, officials with the Chicago Bar Association said they planned to ask the Illinois Supreme Court to examine the process that put the question on the ballot.  The case could result in a do-over, CBA attorney Steven Pflaum said Wednesday.  The bar association wants to clarify the referendum process so the state won&amp;#8217;t end up in court again in 2028, the next time the question is due to appear. An appeal to the Supreme Court will be filed by the end of the month, he said.  &amp;#8220;If (election authorities) had worked with us to clean up the ballot, this could have been avoided,&amp;#8221; Pflaum said. &amp;#8220;Instead, unfortunately, they dug in their heels and, frankly, did as little as possible &amp;#8212; so now we&amp;#8217;re left with what could charitably be called a mess.&amp;#8221;  The Illinois Constitution says that every 20 years it is the secretary of state&amp;#8217;s job to put the convention question on a separate ballot.  Pflaum said those rules weren&amp;#8217;t followed this time around.  The bar association sued Secretary of State Jesse White and the Illinois State Board of Elections last month, arguing the state legislature improperly inserted itself into the process in May by crafting an explanation of the referendum and approving its place on the ballot. The referendum went on to share a ballot with other Illinois races.  The lawsuit charged that the legislature&amp;#8217;s explanation was wrong in saying that not voting on the referendum was equivalent to a &amp;#8220;no&amp;#8221; vote &amp;#8212; a claim Cook County Circuit Judge Nathaniel Howse found to be true.  Howse further ruled that the language showed bias by recounting that the 1988 convention referendum failed by a 3-1 margin.  Lawyers for the state elections board, the Chicago elections board and Cook County Clerk David Orr argued it was too late to reprint ballots. Instead, Howse ordered poll workers to hand out blue fliers informing voters of what he called the &amp;#8220;misleading&amp;#8221; information.  The bar association attempted to appeal the case to the Illinois Supreme Court, which knocked it back to a state appellate court that upheld Howse&amp;#8217;s decision.  If the Supreme Court finds the process of putting the referendum on the ballot failed to meet constitutional requirements, it could order another vote, Pflaum said.  That would likely happen in the 2010 general election, he said.
