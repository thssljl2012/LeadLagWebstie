The fun never stops. A huge bail-out package is announced this morning to the tune of $150Bn.  That is a big number for ONE company.  It goes to show that risk distribution via CDS was a bit of a mirage. CDS ended up concentrating at the re-insurance level a.k.a AIG. It does provide a big fat target for the mother of all corporate bailouts. From the FT:The renegotiation of the bail-out, which could be politically controversial, came after AIG rapidly used up most of the government original facility, raising fears that it could run out of cash.The first wad of cash was $85Bn. They burnt through that money in a blink. AIG is nationalized at 85%.
