The U.S. needs to do what most other industrialized countries do and protect the American car industry. Korea and Japan slap big tariffs on imported cars.  That and universal health insurance would make them competative again.  AIG has gotten $150 billion from Uncle Sam so far. I think they are talking about $25 billion for G.M.  Bankruptcy would put the economy in a death spiral as workers would lose half their wages. Wages create demand which drive the whole economy.
