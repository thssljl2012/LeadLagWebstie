Theyre bailing out the bankers.  Theyre bailing out insurance giant AIG.  Pretty soon, theyll be bailing out the auto industry too.  Hello? Remember us?  If Washington is feeling momentarily generous, if even the Republicans are saying, Nows the time to lend a helping hand  well, I know a highly worthy recipient, and its rumbling beneath our feet.  Bail out the New York City subway!  Theres a tragic hard-luck story right at the MTA.  A $1.2 billion hole in next years budget year. A bus-and-subway fare that could go to $2.50 or $3 a ride. Longer waits for buses. More crowded trains. The prospects of tolls on the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges.  Who knows? The MTA board members could even be forced to give up their cars.  OK, that much we could live with. But in a city whose economy is built on top of mass transit, somehow the people have to get around.  And all David Paterson has to offer is a warm I-feel-your-pain. The bleak numbers, the governor said, are another reminder of the dire fiscal situation facing all New Yorkers.  Gee, thanks, Governor. Thats supposed to make us feel good?  Gene Russianoff of the Staphangers Campaign, who has survived numerous transit battles, said Thursday that the current squeeze is a real one. The best the riders can hope for, he added, is to spread the pain around.  The riders shouldnt make up the entire deficit with high fares and major service cuts, he said.  So pony up, Washington. From the suites to the streets to the subway!  George W. Bush was in New York Thursday trying to calm nerves on Wall Street as the Dow dipped below 8,000 and then shot up 552 points. Of course, he arrived by air and moved through the city by motorcade.   But even Bush recognized that something has to be done, and quickly. Im a market-oriented guy, he said, but not when Im faced with the prospect of a global meltdown.  But dont look up, Mr. President. Look down.
