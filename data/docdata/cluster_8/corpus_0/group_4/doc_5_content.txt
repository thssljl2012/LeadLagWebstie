You can read &amp;quot;Barclays Bank are bastards&amp;quot; here.  This is what happened next&amp;#8230;  At 3.33pm, I got this email from my customer relationship manager.    From:&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Moore, Paula : Local Business Network&amp;quot;                                                                                                                                                                            To:Omani   Closure of Business Account  Thursday, 30 October, 2008 3:33 PM                                                                               Mr Omahaony, (that&amp;#8217;s not how my name is spelled, so I guess her email was written in a hurry)   I have received a call today from the Local Business Customer Service team informing me of your query regarding the closure of your business account O&amp;#8217;Mani &amp;amp; Co.  On initial investigation it is not obvious to me as to why the account has been closed.   Please be assured I am investigating this for you as a matter of urgency and I will get in contact as soon as I have more information.  Apologies for the inconvenience caused.   Please be aware I am out of the office tomorrow on leave so you will not get another response from me until Monday 3rd November.  Many thanks   Paula Moore  Local Business Manager  Bath &amp;amp; Swindon South Team   At 4.06pm, I got this email   Recall: Closure of Business Account  Thursday, 30 October, 2008 4:06 PM                                        From:    &amp;quot;Moore, Paula : Local Business Network&amp;quot;                                                                                                                        To:&amp;nbsp; OMani  &amp;nbsp;                                                     Moore, Paula : Local Business Network would like to recall the message,&amp;quot;Closure of Business Account&amp;quot;. I&amp;#8217;m waiting to see what will happen on Monday.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I suppose she tried to recall the first email and couldn&amp;#8217;t.&amp;nbsp; I wonder why Barclays wanted to recall that email?  I still can&amp;#8217;t believe Barclays closed the business account which I&amp;#8217;ve had with them since setting up my business in 1998, without even telling me.  What a way to reject a customer.   &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;
