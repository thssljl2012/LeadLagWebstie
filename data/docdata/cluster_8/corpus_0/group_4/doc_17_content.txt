Campaign staffers for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jack Markell said Thursday they will return a $1,200 donation from the Bank of America Political Action Committee.The donation, received Oct. 26, was noted in Markell's most recent campaign finance report.Markell, in his third term as treasurer, has said he would not accept donations from banks that do business with the state to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest. Bank of America does business with the state, and staffers said Thursday it was a mistake to accept the check.A $1,200 donation earlier this month from the DelBank PAC is different, Markell spokesman Joe Rogalsky said, because that PAC pools the resources of many banks, rather than representing the interests of one.Markell faces Republican nominee Bill Lee in next Tuesday's general election.- Beth Miller
