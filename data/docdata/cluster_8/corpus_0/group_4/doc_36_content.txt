I tried REALLY ahrd this time to keep up with the account and to not let it go engative. It didn't. The Lowest it got was 20.00.  SO, when I log into it today to check it and I see two overdraft fees, i get PISSED.I called them and they insist we went negative yesterday. sorry but NO we didnt.so needless to say, we will be looking for a new bank ASAP
