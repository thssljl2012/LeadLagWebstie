Bush endorses a bill that will make it much harder for middle-class Americans to get a second chance.  The bill was written by none other than MBNA Corporation.  MBNA Corporation was a bank holding company and parent company of wholly owned subsidiary MBNA America Bank, N.A., headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, prior to being acquired by Bank of America in 2005. It was the world's largest independent credit card issuer, specializing in affinity cards.[1]On June 30, 2005 MBNA announced that it was being acquired by Bank of America for stock and cash totalling more than $35 billion. The deal was closed on January 1, 2006. The acquisition resulted in MBNA being re-named to Bank of America Card Services while still based in Delaware. For the first part of 2006, MBNA still issued credit cards under its own name associated with Mastercard, VISA, and American Express, but by the second half of 2006, all card products were re-branded as Bank of America.Bushes top campaign contributor in his 2005 election for president was none other than MBNA.What did Bush really do for the world except make more people prisoners of debt while bailing out his friends who heaped up all the chaos around us since 9/11 .  This man is a tool, both in the literal and figurative sense.  - RA S
