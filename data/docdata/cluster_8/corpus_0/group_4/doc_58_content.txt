Is Paulson insane?!&amp;nbsp; didn't I and Steve Forbes just go off about how ridiculous Paulson had been blatantly embezzeling billions of federal funds to his rich CEO buddies in the banking industry, the insurance industry, and the auto industry?! &amp;nbsp; now, Paulson, is attempting the biggest embezzlement heist in the history of the world, he wants&amp;nbsp;$1 trillion for Citigroup, the richest american bank in  the world!&amp;nbsp; and this is when people really are in need of money in galveston, texas and montecito, california due to hundreds of homes destroyed by terrible disasters! &amp;nbsp; giving $1 trillion to Citigroup does not help any poor americans whatsoever! getting a Citibank Visa card is completely dependent on your credit rating, which is based on outstanding debt and time it took you to pay. Giving $1 trillion to Citibank will not raise your chances of getting a credit card in any way! &amp;nbsp; even more insane, the primary owner of Citigroup is a saudi prince named al-waleed bin talal, check: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Waleed_bin_Talal active duty marines are coming back from afghanistan for thanksgiving weekend after hunting for bin laden, another saudi prince, and paulson is attempting to embezzle $1 trillion of hard earned american tax money into the richest bank in&amp;nbsp;america that is owned&amp;nbsp;by a saudi! &amp;nbsp; Paulson is by definition financially aiding and abetting al quida&amp;nbsp;since bin laden had been declared al quida after 9/11 (when in reality al quida was&amp;nbsp;formerly the&amp;nbsp;CIA code word for african immigrant terrorist after the 1993 WTC bombing commited by yussef ramsey, from egypt, north africa, and Black Hawk Down, where our US soldiers were killed and dragged in the streets by somalian africans, who had also been  responsible for&amp;nbsp;200&amp;nbsp;attacks on ships all over the world this&amp;nbsp;year alone)! &amp;nbsp; there is only one thing left to do, every wall street gambler, every vegas gambler, every homeless lottery ticket buyer will be betting on who will shoot paulson first?!&amp;nbsp; will it be active duty marines returning from&amp;nbsp;afghanistan, hunting for bin laden, a saudi,&amp;nbsp;only&amp;nbsp;to find out paulson wants to embezzle $1 trillion to&amp;nbsp;citigroup that is owned by a rich saudi prince&amp;nbsp;literally financially aiding and abetting al quida?!&amp;nbsp; will it be&amp;nbsp;active duty&amp;nbsp;army troops returning from iraq, some of which lost arms and legs due to IED attacks from al quida, only to fund out that paulson is publically financing al quida!&amp;nbsp; will it be galveston, texans, some of which had been living in tents&amp;nbsp;2 months after hurricane Ike, some of which had been wanting to lynch paulson for giving billions of hard tax money to his rich wall street buddies while they were starving in texas after the&amp;nbsp;flood?!&amp;nbsp; will it be montecito, cali fire victims, who have no homes due to a terrible cali wildfire, who obviously need the money for emergency food, supplies, and reconstruction, but paulson chose to give money&amp;nbsp;they desperately needed to&amp;nbsp;one of the richest saudi's in the world, literally aiding and abetting al quida?! will it be africans who are notorious for kidnap and ransom schemes, kidnapping paulson, so he  would be forced to send the money to africa to feed starving people in africa (when in reality africa doesn't accept american cash, africa only uses african cash)!&amp;nbsp; will it be the FBI or the CIA finally doing its job now that paulson is too blatantly aiding abetting al quida financially?! &amp;nbsp; to save paulson from being shot for being such an idiot, as the primary owner of the US federal government (with $1.4 trillion invested in US t.bonds from japanese and chinese investors), i must make a federal executive veto  for the $1 trillion dollar request for citigroup!
