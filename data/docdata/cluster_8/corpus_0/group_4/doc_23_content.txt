Standing in the ever embiggening cue at the Bank of America to pay my Credit card bill, I noticed dork-o the bank manager quizzing people "and what brings you to bank of America today?"  He was looking for some sort of sales opportunity, and if I had to guess, has been a manager for less than a month.  He was willing to be helpful up to the point of actually manning another window to move the line more quickly.  Everyone had equally mundane things.  Make a deposit.  Make a payment. Stand around and look stupid.  Whatever.  He eventually circles back and cheerfully tells me he can help me.  I have no idea why he couldn't help the person in front of me.He tried to sell me on online bullcrappery.  I should get my checking account there.  Blah blah sell sell sell sell.  Sir, I just want to make my payment and get back to my office, as I promised I'd be back in 5 minutes.  Oh, sure sure, but....I see you're a Redskins fan!  You can get a Redskins fan!  You could get Redskins checks blah blah then I kicked his face in blah blah blah.  But I just want to make my payment and goooooooooooooo.........He did do my payment.  He didn't use any "machinery" or "computer" to record my payment.  Just put my check in an envelope, marked off "payment" and wrote the amount of the payment.  And he wrote the incorrect amount.I have no faith that he'll do it correctly.  Fortunately, I got his card, and fortunately, I'm an easily recognizable motherfucker.
