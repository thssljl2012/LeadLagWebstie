Our business banking has been with the coop for a couple of years now, and they are fantastic - great deals through the FSB, switched on call centre staff when you call, good ethical trading policy, and we haven't actually had to visit a bank in the flesh in the last 2 years.  So, so much better than HSBC and Barclays, both of whom have been beyond appalling in our dealings with them.  Is anyone else a fan of this bank?
