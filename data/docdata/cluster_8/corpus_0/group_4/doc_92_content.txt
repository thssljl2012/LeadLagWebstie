From David Staples at Canwest via the Vancouver Sun,    Can the National Hockey League&amp;#8217;s economic boom survive the recent economic crash?   This question is troubling NHL bosses, financiers, players and observers.   Now, as the league has begun to enjoy the benefits of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) of 2005, it must make sense of the recent worldwide stock market crash, an economic upheaval that has brought to mind that most famous of stock market crashes, the Wall Street crash of October 1929. That economic calamity triggered the Great Depression and ended the NHL&amp;#8217;s first economic boom.  continued...
