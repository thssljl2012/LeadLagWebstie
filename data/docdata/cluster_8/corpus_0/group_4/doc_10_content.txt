 Yesterday I decided to take the day off and go handle my business (literally).  Now that the election is over, I finally decided how to invest my money (my broker was SHOCKED to see me show up at the bank unexpectedly after calling me umpteen times to come in). Anyway, yesterday was the first time in my life that I experienced what it must have been like for black people living in the 60s.  The many whites that I encountered were not happy, to say the least. One white man went ballistic at a black female teller at Bank of America&amp;#8217;s Buckhead location.  I have never seen that happen before at that location. I tried to joke with a Korean man in line behind me about the long wait at BofA, but he totally ignored me and averted his eyes to avoid making eye contact. Most whites that I encountered yesterday made eye contact with me a bit longer than normal &amp;#8212; almost as if they expected me to say or do something.  They neither smiled nor said hello &amp;#8212; which was unusual.  The awkwardness was palpable. I also heard from a loyal reader yesterday who said she went to work at 8:30 am only to learn that she, along with 4 co-workers (two of them white) had been laid off.  She said they were all Obama supporters.  And since two of them were white she couldn&amp;#8217;t claim discrimination. Unfortunately, Georgia is an at-will state, meaning employers can fire employees at will and they don&amp;#8217;t need a reason. Welp, so much for Obama bringing this country together and overcoming the racial divide.   Did you get laid off yesterday or do you know anyone who was laid off for supporting Obama? Did you have any awkward moments yesterday with people of another race?
