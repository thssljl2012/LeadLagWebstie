Toxic Mega Colon vs. Holistic Semicolonalso, bank error not in my favor, I lose $50.Went to the bank, noticed my balance was $50 too low.Teller: "You were charged a fee for being below the minimum balance."Me: "I have no minimum balance"Teller sends me to managerManager: "Hunh, the account was setup incorrectly, let me fix that so you get charged no minimum balance fees in the future."Me: "So I'll have that fee refunded, right"Manager: "Sorry, I can't do that"Me: "Wait, so you admit you were in error charging me, but you won't refund it"Manager: "That's right.  Sorry I can't reverse the fees"Me: HAETSecond time in two months the bank has screwed me over.  Later in the day when I'm not stuck on a conference call I'll be phoning in to their 800 number in search of a live human phone rep I can torment.  I'll probably be switching over to Bank of America or some other bank/credit union soon.  Mild annoyances are annoying, but they're nice punching bags to work out my other frustrations on.
