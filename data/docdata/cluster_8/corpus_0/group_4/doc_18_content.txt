 International travel is down signaling the overseas job probability as not so possible.   Who wants to move overseas in this dwindling job market?     The Profession haters on this board (we all know who you are) are running out of utopic places to tell pilots where to run to and from our Profession.   All the while, back here in the good ol' USA, opportunity is presenting itself.  Only starry eyed and suicidal (Jonestown-ish?) McCain supporters can justify how he would be good fro the profession.  Fact is not only is Obama friendly towards labor, he enthusiastically supports it.  With so many appointments to be made that will effect the Profession, DOL, DOJ, FAA, NMB, TSA, etc., it is quite a pleasant tailwind.   In addition, never before in airline history have so many CBA's been amenable at the same time.  The ability with a Pro Labor Administration, to simultaneously strike or threaten to strike is powerful leverage.   The Perfect Storm hit us in Sept 2001 and kept on battering us till 2007.  Management leveraged that storm against us, took advantage of us and decimated the profession.   Is the our Perfect Storm brewing?     We can't point to the global market place anymore and say 'look at those great jobs'.  Seems like we are stuck in the good ol USA with our own profession.     What to do?     So do you shrug your shoulders and say whatever?  Or do you become a part of this opportunity to restore and promote Our Profession?   Do you leave it up to the same ol' usual union volunteers, the good ones and the bad ones?  Or do you man up yourself and work, just a little bit, using the leverage of our Perfect Storm?   As Americans, do we stay engaged in democracy or do we return to apathy and hope the White House figures out what we want and need?   As professionals, who controls our Profession?   The choice is ours.
