************************************************************************************************* The difference between Socialism and Communism is quite simple: With Socialism the government pretends the people own what was once private companies, whereas with Communism the government makes no such pretense.  The US federal Government has been buying into privately owned banks and now has taken the first step into other territory with another &amp;#8220;investment&amp;#8221; in AIG (American International Group).  AIG is a huge international insurance company whose CEO&amp;#8217;s took them into making risky loan guarantees during the feeding frenzy that took place within finacial institutions with the granting of mortgages to people who were known to be unable to make the payments when the Adjustable Rate Mortgages adjusted upwards. This frenzy started with the Carter administration when Congress and President Carter directed Freddy Mac and Fanny Mae to loosen mortgage requirements for low income groups. It really got going however under Clinton in the mid 1990&amp;#8217;s, and went full steam ahead with all kinds of legal but very shaky deals called &amp;#8220;derivatives&amp;#8221;. (For an explaination of these terms and the particulars of what took place during the so-called Financial Crisis you may go to my archives for the month of September and October.) The government initially bailed AIG out with a loan of $85 billion. However that seems not to be enough to stabilize the company so a portion of the $700 billion Bail Out enacted by a stupid Congress (but only after $149 Billion in pork bought enough Republican votes to get them to go along with the Democrats in this scheme. And even after tens of thousands of citizens contacted their Congressmen demanding this action not be taken. See my post &amp;#8220;Bail Out? Hell No!&amp;#8221;) The initial agreement with AIG has been rewritten. &amp;#8220;All told, the moves boost aid to the company to around $150 billion. The $40 billion infusion comes from the recently enacted $700 billion financial bailout package. The government is buying preferred shares of AIG stock, giving taxpayers an ownership stake in the company. In turn, restrictions will be placed on executive compensation at the firm.&amp;#8221; See article for full details: Headlines: Government provides new aid to AIG By JEANNINE AVERSA, AP Economics Writer http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081110/ap_on_bi_ge/aig_bailout
