Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  AS many as 200,000 Commonwealth Bank customers have been hit by an online glitch that mistakenly duplicated withdrawals from their accounts.  The bank said the problem occurred in processing overnight.  It hoped to rectify it later today but admitted it could take until tomorrow morning.  CBA spokesman Steven Batten said that money was taken out of some accounts following bill payments and withdrawals over the weekend.  'Overnight, there were some transactions that have been duplicated as a result of a processing problems,' Mr Batten said.  'We're still trying to confirm the cause and we understand around 200,000 customers have been impacted.'  He said customers who have incurred fees because of the error will not be out of pocket.  'If they have been charged any fees such as overdrawn fees they can contact us and we will refund them,' he said.  Mr Batten said customers affected by the processing error and in need of cash should visit one of their branches.
