In a sign that financial hardship has overwhelmed many struggling families, a record 277 repossession orders were served in October, compared with an average of about 250 for the year.  It is about three times the number served on home owners five years ago.  Financial counsellors say they have been flooded with pleas for help this year. A manager of one homeless service said people with mortgages were now seeking food parcels and travel assistance.  A woman who was forced out of her home when she became ill and lost her job said lenders 'lured' people with 100 per cent loans that left them with nowhere to go if they couldn't meet payments.  The woman, 37, said she was now forced to file for bankruptcy because she had borrowed 100 per cent of her home's worth. 'That was my biggest mistake,' she said.  'All I have is the clothes on my back. It's gone from chocolates to boiled lollies,' she said.  'I'm lucky I had somewhere to go at my mum's. I could have been out on the streets.'  Supreme Court documents show further interest rate cuts can't come soon enough for many families; in the last two years more than 5000 repossession orders have been served.  In the past month about nine orders were served per day. Of the big banks, the Commonwealth Bank pursued the most loans in that time, serving repossession orders at an average rate of one a day.  Gary Rothman, from Uniting Care, said interest rate cuts were not enough to immediately reverse the damage.  He said repossessions had been on 'a steady increase' for two years and more people, having borrowed to the limit, had now been left without room to negotiate.  'The problem with some of those loans are, they are negative equity mortgages, where the value of the loan is greater than the value of the property,' Mr Rothman said.
