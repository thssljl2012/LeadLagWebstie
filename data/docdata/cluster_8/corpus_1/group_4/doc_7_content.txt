Your Email:  Washington - President-elect Barack Obama (web news bio) used his private meeting with outgoing President George Bush (web news bio) to push for another stimulus package to bailout the country's failing economy. He also wants to give an immediate cash infusion to American automakers. This after General Motors saw its stock drop yesterday, to a low not seen since 1948.  Meantime, the government has approved an increase of the bailout of insurance giant AIG, to a record $150 billion. But even as AIG executives were asking for more money, they were spending hundreds of thousands yet again at another posh resort. This time, they met at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort in Phoenix. Caught on tape a second time now are the top execs' cocktail parties, limos, and dinner out at a top restaurant.  Struggling homeowners are getting some help as well; this time not from a government bailout, but from lending giant Citigroup. The company is offering a moratorium on foreclosures, allowing homeowners who are behind on payments to pay no more than 38 percent of their total income towards their mortgage. That's something the incoming president advocated, back on the campaign trail.  With all of these economic concerns as a backdrop, the president-elect will be under increasing pressure to name his choice for treasury secretary and other key cabinet posts as soon as possible. Still, no announcements are expected this week.
