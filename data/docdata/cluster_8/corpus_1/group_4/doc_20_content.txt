The Nov. 14 Business story 'AIG to Pay Millions to Top Workers,' about AIG's plan to pay $503 million 'to keep valuable workers from exiting the troubled insurance giant,' shows AIG's continued arrogance and stupidity.  The greedy hubris of those top employees is the primary reason that AIG is in dire straits. I know of no evidence that shows that such 'top employees' will do better for a business than other competent workers. In fact, I think there is good reason to believe that smart, good people do as well in business leadership as the avaricious egomaniacs that American businesses (following the foolish guidance of our top business schools) tend to cater to as their top dogs.  AIG should be glad to be rid of those people, even if they are top employees. AIG needs to regain the public's confidence, and this spending of $503 million will not help. Regarding the Nov. 14 Business article 'AIG to Pay Millions to Top Workers': I have my own 'deferred compensation' account, my 401(k). Why doesn't AIG tighten its belt and do its part to help restore that account before disbursing cash incentives to retain the 'top talent' whose decisions led to a $152 billion taxpayer-funded bailout?
