 Commonwealth Bank customers across Australia have found themselves short of money today after an online glitch mistakenly duplicated withdrawals from their accounts.  The double-up, caused by an overnight processing error, has affected NetBank customers, the bank said this morning.  It hoped to rectify the glitch later today but admitted it could take until tomorrow morning.  Meanwhile, the bank has been deluged by calls from people 'seeking clarification' about their accounts. 'The bank is working to identify the cause of the error and understand how many customers have been impacted,' a statement read. 'Our technical teams are working to rectify the issue and reverse these duplicated transactions as a priority.' NetBank is the online outlet of Commonwealth Bank's banking services. 'Any customers impacted by this and who are seeking immediate cash should visit one of our branches,' the bank said. 'No customer will be charged fees or interest as a result of this problem.' One customer said the problems had occurred as early as Friday with automated payments being deducted twice.  Another told Fairfax Radio that he pulled into a petrol station at 1am today and went to pay with his credit card but was told there was no money in his account when there was supposed to be over $5000.  Commonwealth Bank shares rose $1.55, or 5.1%, to $31.77, broadly in line with the general market.  czappone@fairfax.com.au  BusinessDay, with AAP
