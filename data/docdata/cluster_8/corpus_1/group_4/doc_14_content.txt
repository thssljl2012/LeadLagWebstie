Some of those requests are for information related to your spouse or grown children. (A copy of the questionnaire is on the left in pdf format.)   You'll need to list every place you've lived and anybody with whom you've lived.   Questions about conflicts of interest include asking whether you or your family has been affiliated with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mack, or insurance giant AIG.   Under Domestic Help, you'll be asked the immigration status of your housekeepers, nannies, chauffeurs and yard workers.   The questionnaire asks whether you've sent any e-mails, text messages or instant messages that might embarrass you.   You also will be asked to provide links to your blog or Facebook page, any screen names you use on the Internet and any aliases you have. Again, the administration is looking for anything about you that might be, 'a possible embarrassment to you, your family, or the president-elect.' Stephanie Cutter, a spokeswoman for the transition office, tells  this vetting process is part of Obama's commitment of changing the way Washington does business. (
