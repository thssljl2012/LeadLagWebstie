Commonwealth Bank has vowed to prevent further computer glitches, one day after 200,000 customer accounts were plunged into chaos when weekend transactions were duplicated.  'We're currently auditing our process to ensure it doesn't happen again,' said a spokesman for the bank. 'We're trying to ensure our customers are not put out again by the fees.'  The bank was forced to restore customer accounts yesterday, after customers deluged the bank when they noticed discrepancies in their accounts following the errors. The bank said yesterday the errors had been resolved and that in-ward fees would be restored.  Account holders in recent days, also voiced concerns any shortage of funds may trigger fees from third-party vendors.  Commonwealth Bank said any customers assessed third-party fees as a result of the computer glitch should contact the bank for help.  The bank traced the glitch back to a 'batch' file containing all the details of transactions over the weekend that failed to complete on Sunday. When the file was rerun on Monday night, it caused the duplication, the bank said.  The bank also said interest calculations would be adjusted to account for periods when funds may have been moved out of customers balances.  Customers had reported massive changes in their account balances, as some were double debited, while others doubled credited.
