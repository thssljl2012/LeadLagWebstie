The Commonwealth Bank has fixed up the problem that short-changed around 200,000 people due to a computer glitch.  Process duplication meant that all withdrawals on Tuesday had been done twice, leaving people with less money in their accounts.  But the bank said on Wednesday that the problem had now been fixed and all its customers' accounts were back in order. 'Any fees or interest incurred as a result of this problem will also be automatically reversed,' a CBA spokesman said.  On Tuesday, CBA spokesman Steven Batten told AAP that money was taken out of some accounts following bill payments and withdrawals over the weekend. 'Overnight, there were some transactions that have been duplicated as a result of a processing problems,' Mr Batten said. He said customers who had incurred fees from the bank because of the error would be refunded automatically.  Those who were hit with fees from third parties should contact the bank for advice.
