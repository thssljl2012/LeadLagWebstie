CHICAGO (Reuters) - Since his election last week, Barack Obama has largely avoided getting entangled in resolving issues now that will face him later as president, except for one big item: Bailing out the U.S. auto industry.  A heated debate has broken out in Washington over whether to use $25 billion of a $700 billion financial bailout package to provide a lifeline to the Big Three automakers -- GM, Ford and Chrysler -- which are suffering from plummeting sales.  Professing that the United States has 'only one president at a time,' Obama is avoiding Washington this week as world leaders who would love to take his measure are gathering there for a financial summit.  He is also steering clear of a lame-duck session of the U.S. Congress that will attempt to craft a new economic stimulus package, a job that will be left to him when he takes over on Jan. 20 should an agreement fail to materialize.  But Obama, a Democrat who had solid support of labor unions during his presidential campaign, has come out firmly in favor of the auto bailout, raising the issue at a news conference last Friday and again in talks with Republican President George W. Bush on Monday.  Obama transition leader John Podesta told reporters on Tuesday that Obama wants to ensure that the auto industry survives to produce 'the kind of vehicles that the American public need, and complete the job of creating more efficient vehicles that meet our energy needs.' Proponents of a bailout see the auto industry as an important source for millions of U.S. jobs that must be saved, not just in production lines, but rippling down to auto parts companies, car dealers and repair shops.  If the U.S. government is willing to bail out insurance giant AIG with $150 billion in taxpayer funds, surely it can send $25 billion to Detroit, according to this line of thinking. Continued...
