KPMG, one of the UK's leading providers of professional services including audit, tax, financial and risk advisory this week signed up to the ICARUS commitment. They join other major UK corporations, including the BBC, Carillion, Barclays and Inmarsat in support of the drive by the Institute of Travel Management UK &amp;amp; Ireland (ITM), through Project ICARUS, to reduce emissions from corporate travel programmes by 60% by 2050 and to seek accreditation for proven emission reductions through ICARUS accreditation. This brings the number of companies who have signed the commitment to ten, with some of the first to sign up presently being audited for bronze accreditation -- the next stage after the 'commitment stage'.Paul Tilstone, Executive Director of ITM, said of the addition of KPMG, 'This is fantastic news. That a company of the stature of KPMG recognises the importance of committing to ICARUS and demonstrates the leadership ITM and the ten committed companies to date are taking. KPMG will be able to wear its ICARUS commitment badge with pride and clearly demonstrate to business travel suppliers and other stakeholders that they mean business when it comes to greening their travel programme.'Mike Kelly, Director of Corporate Social Responsibility at KPMG commented 'KPMG has a long term commitment to managing and reducing our carbon footprint. As a professional services firm, we find that air travel contributes significantly to our total carbon emissions, our participation in Project ICARUS is an opportunity to identify further ways in which to effectively manage our business travel needs.'
