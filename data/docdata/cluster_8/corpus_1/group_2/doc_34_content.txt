 by Henryk Zientek, Huddersfield Daily ExaminerBUSINESSES with a community focus are making a major contribution to the Huddersfield area.Many companies and their staff are often called on to support charitable causes  perhaps by donating prizes for raffles.Others go further by encouraging staff to volunteer to help community groups and schools with their projects.The Community Award is a key category in the Examiner Business Awards  and aims to reward organisations going the extra mile to be good neighbours.Judges will be looking for companies making a committed and proactive contribution to the enhancement and benefit of their local community.They will also want to see evidence of good management to achieve these goals.Last year, the award went to the staff at the Huddersfield town centre branch of Barclays Bank.Employees had raised more than 25,000 to benefit more than 50 local charities in a two-year period.In addition, more than 80 staff took part in 20 volunteer projects for local organisations  sharing their time and skills for the benefit of a variety of voluntary groups and schools.The category is being sponsored by NHS Kirklees, the main NHS body responsible for healthcare and improving the health of people living across the district.A spokesman said: We are the champion for better health and make sure local NHS services reflect the needs of local people as well as offer value for money.With a budget of 575m NHS Kirklees is responsible for commissioning a range of health services, including hospitals, ambulances, mental health and other specialist services and agreescontracts with local GPs, dentists, pharmacists and optometrists to deliver high-quality services for everyone.NHS Kirklees also providesa range of community-based health services including district nursing, health visiting, sexual health and contraception services, podiatry and child health services.We work jointly with Kirklees Council on a number of projects to improve the health and well being for all the people of Kirklees. NHS Kirklees sponsors the Community Award to highlight the importance of engaging with our local population.
