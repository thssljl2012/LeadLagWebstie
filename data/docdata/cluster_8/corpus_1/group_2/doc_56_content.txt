Leaders of Sramik Karmachari Oikya Parishad (SKOP) at a meeting have termed the government move to relax ban on the activities of trade union in a limited form an irony, says a press release.Limited trade unionism is a glaring example of the violation of the internationally recognised basic human rights of the labourers, they added.They demanded withdrawal of all embargoes on the activities of trade union. The SKOP leaders said it is not acceptable to the workers across the world, because it will serve the interests of the multinational companies. This trend is not healthy for developing good relations between the owners and workers.All kinds of unionism, including CBA election and general meeting are run by the constitution of the union and the existing rules of the labour law, they said, adding that the decision of meeting with 100 to 500 chosen people is completely undemocratic and anti-constitution.Central leader of SKOP Shah Mohammed Abu Zafar, Abdul Kader Hawlader, Roy Ramesh, Shafiuddin Ahmed, Dr Wazedul Islam, Choudhury Ashikul Alam, Shahidullah Choudhury, Rasheduzzaman Ratan and Habibullah took part in the meeting with Abdul Matin Master in the chair.
