The developer of the ambitious Atlantic Yards arena and residential complex in Brooklyn said Monday that the project could be delayed for another six months after a state appellate court failed to dismiss a court challenge brought by opponents of the $4 billion project. Earlier this month, the developer  vowed that he would break ground in December on the long delayed project, where he plans to build an office tower, 15 apartment buildings and a basketball arena for the Nets. The developer has fended off a number of lawsuits brought by critics of the project over the past two years. He and state officials had expected that the state Appellate Court would also dismiss the latest suit, which sought to block the state from using eminent domain to seize private property for Mr. Ratners project.Instead, the court denied a motion to dismiss the suit, opening the door for oral arguments in the case next spring.In a statement, Mr. Ratner said the court ruling may delay the project for six months. Atlantic Yards will be built and it will create thousands of needed jobs and affordable homes, Mr. Ratners statement said. This is all the more important as our city and country confront one of the most difficult downturns in history.Opponents of the project, including the group Develop Dont Destroy Brooklyn, were thrilled. The seizure of my clients homes and businesses is unconstitutional, said Matthew Brinckerhoff, a lawyer who filed the lawsuit. We are pleased that the court has recognized the merit of our case and will now hear the arguments in full.Mr. Ratner, chief executive of  companies, is also awaiting a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service on whether he can issue tax exempt bonds to pay for the $1 billion arena, which is the first project to be built.Barclays Bank, which had signed a $20 million a year sponsorship and naming rights deal for the arena, said yesterday that it was still behind the project. A clause in its contract with Forest City requires the developer to close on the property by the end of November.We look forward to being in Brooklyn with our partners at  and the Nets, said Peter Truell, a spokesman for Barclays.
