A GIRLS team from Barclays Capital are preparing to test their body and minds to the limits in a new adventure race.Carol Williamson, Nadine Fraser and Jennifer McCormick, who all work in the legal department of Barclays Capital, will compete in the 24seven Challenge in the Forest of Dean.Over the weekend of October 11 and 12, the girls will compete in seven different mental and physical tasks over 24 hours while covering a marathon distance on foot, by bike and across water.Part of the challenge will include completing navigational tasks and puzzles but many of the event details are being kept a secret by organisers CLIC, a children's cancer charity.Solicitor Carol, 32, said: 'We are curious about the event and what we are going to have to do, but I think it's almost better that we don't know exactly what we have let ourselves in for.'But the more sponsorship we raise, the more they will tell us which is a good incentive.'Beverley Mackenzie, challenge events manager for CLIC Sargent said 24seven was not just about who is the fittest as all-round endurance, stamina and resolve will also be needed.'Mental dexterity, careful planning and smart thinking will count for just as much as how fit you are.'To sponsor the girls, visit www.24sevenchallenge.co.uk/xxfactor/
