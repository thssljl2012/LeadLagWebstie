Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich keeps trying all kinds of gimmicks to get more people signed up for taxpayer-subsidized health insurance, from outreach programs to $50 gas card giveaways. Nationwide, those kinds of efforts have led to a decline in the number of uninsured people. In 2007, 45.7 million Americans were uninsured, compared with 46.9 million in 2006.But in Illinois, population 12.6 million, the number of uninsured has stayed at roughly 1.7 million. Wonder how Blagojevich explains that?Another troubling statistic is the number of poor on Medicaid in Illinois --an estimated 1.53 million people, according to Census Bureau estimates. That's the fifth highest Medicaid enrollment in the nation. Illinois is also the fifth most populous state; however, that doesn't make us feel any better about the high number of people on Medicaid. It is yet another indication of the state's poor record of bringing jobs and opportunities to Illinois.
