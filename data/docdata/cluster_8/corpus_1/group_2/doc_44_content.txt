 The Bulgarian unit of German retail chain Metro has joined an agreement with the Sofia municipality to use biodegradable bags in its stores. So far, the agreement has been signed by a series of local retail chains such as Mr. Bricolage, CBA, 345, Adriatic Group BG and ice-cream producer Darko.Municipal authorities in Sofia sent the draft agreement to some of the biggest retailers in the city in July as part of efforts to reduce environment pollution caused by the widespread use of plastic bags. By joining the agreement, retailers commit to use bags made of biodegradable materials and to require a usability certificate by the producer of the packaging they are using. Sofia municipality, in its turn, has engaged to take part in different joint initiatives aimed to protect the environment. The agreement is open and any commercial facility willing to join it can do it at any moment.
