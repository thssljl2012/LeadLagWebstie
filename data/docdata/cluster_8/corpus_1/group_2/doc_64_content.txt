The state today withdrew its controversial proposal to dump sewage sludge and river dredge at the EnCap site while the fate of the Meadowlands project is still being hashed out in court.In a letter to U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Novalyn L. Winfield, an attorney for the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission acknowledged that the state has been unable to make a convincing case to allow more dumping at the site.The commission had argued that revenue from accepting the waste materials at the Kingsland and Avon landfills in Lyndhurst would generate money to fund continued remediation at the project site, which has been quiet in the months since EnCap sought bankruptcy protection.But EnCap and a group of bankers who financed the defunct landfill-to-links project objected. The projects main insurer, American International Group, also demurred.The objectors argued that the addition of possibly contaminated material might harm the site and complicate future development efforts. They also said more dumping would make it harder to sort out the various streams of fill and recycled materials taken there since the project began in May 2004.The Meadowlands Commission has criticized AIG, the financially troubled insurance giant, for not making good on a $148-million surety bond that was supposed to be used if the project failed. The insurer says late changes to the contracts surrounding the project may have voided that obligation.The Meadowlands Commission tried one avenue to address the environmental conditions on this site and it didnt lead us to the desired endpoint. Were now willing to try another route, said NJMC Executive Director Robert Ceberio. The NJMC remains committed to remediating this site quickly, safely and responsibly, and we believe any road that gets us there is worth exploring.Millions of dollars the commission had saved to close the landfills was tapped by the McGreevey administration in 2002 to close what it said was a $2-billion gap in the state budget.Also today, the commission agreed to enter into mediation with most of the other parties involved in EnCaps complicated Chapter 11 action. So far, dozens of creditors, bankers and state agencies have filed claims as part of multi-million-dollar meltdown of the landfill-to-golf-links project.Mediation talks are scheduled to begin Thursday.
