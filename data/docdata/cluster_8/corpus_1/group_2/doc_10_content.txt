I guess folks are expected to start buying cars again soon...'Do not regret growing old, it is a privilege denied to many'.Happily clinging to my guns and religion.

For those wishing to improve their portfolios, also include undervalued tech stocks such as INAP, and APPL. INAP is worth less than half BV and has extra clean books. They lost a large amount of customers over the past year because mgmt dropped the ball on their sales team. Now, mgmt is shook up and ready to go. I am excited. Come back in 9-12 months.Disclaimer- I own both GM and INAP. I have owned APPL in the past. I generally don't offer my portfolio or tips but considering the whole market situation right now, what the hell?!
