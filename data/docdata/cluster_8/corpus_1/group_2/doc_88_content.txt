AA workers left to pay 30 million taken out of AA by Tim Parker with cuts in pension benefitsAA/Saga have proposed to cut the pension benefits paid to AA workers who retire early. They seek to retire after years of long and stressful hours on the roads of Britain have taken a toll on their health and welfare. In some cases the benefits would be halved. The company - using the Orwellian language they learned since been taken over in 2004 by private equity- claim that they are obliged to penalise these workers to comply with age discrimination legislation.Paul Maloney, National Officer of GMB trade union which represents the majority of unionised staff within the AA/Saga said ' GMB condemns outright AA/Saga for their actions against their own staff. They continue to rue the day that the multi-millionaire elite who run the private equity industry took over these companies and wrecked havoc on numbers employed, pay terms and conditions and now pension benefits. They deprived the staff of the ability to fight these cuts when the HR department helped to set up a staff association in place of independent GMB.It is rich for AA/Saga, who live off pensioners business to, on the one hand demonstrate on behalf of pensioners against the Government, and on the other hand, cuts a valuable pension benefit from their own staff.These staff are being sweated to pay interest to Barclays Bank on the 4.6 billion borrowing used to line the pockets of the fat cats from private equity when they headed for the exit last year and left the Company saddled with 4.6 billion debts. Tim Parker, Boris Johnsons erstwhile number two in London, personally took out 30 million when he left after less then 3 years there. AA patrols will now pay for this largesse with cuts in their pensions. GMB do not rule out action if these cuts are not withdrawn.'EndsContact: Paul Maloney, GMB National Officer on 07801 343839 or GMB Press Office: Steve Pryle on 07921 289880 or Rose Conroy on 07974 251823
