Why not take that money and bail out the people losing their homes? AIG, which happens to be our insurance company for home and auto, got bailed out last week. This week, we get our auto insurance premium and it has gone up $200. Wall Street, insurance companies and banks have raped the people of this country enough!NAME: CindyRANT: Why should I bail out banks and their CEOs when they make millions? Who is going to pay my bills? I don't get bailed out, so make them pay back with late fees and over the limit fees like the rest of us. Quit making up numbers and lying about income so someone can buy a house. Get real! Get a life, go to work and work hard, just like me and my family.NAME: VicRANT: In what way is this bailout supposed to help the middle class? We're not getting any relief for our house payments, to keep a roof over our family's head or for food on our tables. Yes, it might stimulate the economy in some way, but the best way to stimulate it is to put money in our pockets. We can then purchase necessities and pay our mortgage, thereby circulating money and helping the banks. Bankers will just get the bailout funds and keep it in their greedy pockets.NAME: TerryRANT: Why doesn't the government put the bailout money where it belongs? Offer everyone with a foreclosure on a mortgage to pay it off 10 cents on the dollar. That will get every one of who is struggling off the hook. Maybe then we can concentrate on paying down the credit cards we've borrowed from and get our credit back.NAME: DavidRANT: If the government must spend $700 billion of taxpayer money, why not give it to the taxpayers? Let them decide how it should be spent. For a family of four, this would equate to $9,200 or $2,300 per person. This would certainly provide economic stimulus for the country and sufficient relief for those suffering from their mortgage woes.Copyright 2008 by KVVU.com.
