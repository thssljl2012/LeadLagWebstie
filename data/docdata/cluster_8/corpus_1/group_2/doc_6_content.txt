A 50-STRONG crowd witnessed the Connect charity shop in Shepperton re-open on Friday, seven months after it was destroyed in an arson attack.They enjoyed sandwiches and cakes with the Mayor of Spelthorne, Simon Bhadaye, who cut the ribbon and it wasn't long before the bargain-hunting started again and by 1pm, the numbers had swelled further.Pam Lucas, 84, has been connected with the High Street shop, which raises money for the mental health charity, Cathja, for 18 years, and said they were determined to get back up and running.She said: 'There were times when we couldn't see it happening because the rebuilding took so long, but it's wonderful to be back.'In the aftermath of the blaze, which destroyed the front of the shop and caused extensive smoke damage to the rest of it, Connect was helped by the Shepperton branch of Barclays, which provided a team of volunteers to build a storage shed for the goods that could be saved.Cashier Julie Messenbird said: 'It's the first time I have known absolutely everyone in the branch helping out with something like this, but it was well worth it because it's a great cause and shop's been totally transformed.'Cathja director Carl Kirby-Turner said the charity would not have survived if Connect hadn't been saved and said: 'Itprovides us with 40% of our income and is essential.'Regular Connect customer Ellen Bass, of Govett Avenue, said: 'There was a void in the village when it was closed. I'm so pleased.'
