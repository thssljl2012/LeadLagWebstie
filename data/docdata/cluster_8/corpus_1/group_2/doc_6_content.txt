We recommend passengers avoid travelling unless their journey is absolutely essential. "lers should check-in as normal for the train times given on their tickets and we will try to put you on one of the next available trains."This could mean waiting a long time before boarding. Journey times will also be significantly longer."Eurostar said check-in at St Pancras would close at 6.45pm until further notice."All travellers with non-essential journeys up to Sunday September 21 can get a refund or exchange their tickets for travel at a later date," the statement added."Eurotunnel, the operator of the Channel Tunnel, is working hard to enable additional Eurostar services to be restored following the fire. Eurostar thanks its travellers for their continued patience and understanding."Thousands of holidaymakers were stranded after the 16-hour blaze, which started on a Folkestone to Calais train about seven miles from the French end, shut the link between Britain and France. // (typeof dartOrd 'undefined') + 'ipt + // Share this article    vine   Barclays has pulled out of talks to bail-out struggling US investment bank Lehman Brothers, sources close to the negotiations said.
