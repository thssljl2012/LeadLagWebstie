OF the many first rules of trading, the first rule is dont panic. The other first rule is make sure you always carry plenty of cash.Why, because if you have spent all your cash on shotguns and enough tinned food for three months, now, yes now, is as good as any time to trade.Monday was a significant day. Some may say very significant. You already know that. I was rooted firmly at my desk and decided to focus exclusively on Barclays. I havent traded the bank for months and kicked myself at the beginning of September for missing a trading opportunity. I wasnt going to miss one this week.Within two hours of the open I bought Barclays at 316p. By lunchtime the share was trading around 280p. I had my finger on the trigger and I really wanted to trade. I rehearsed the first rule of trading in my head dont chase and so sat back. Pre-market indications from the US suggested they would have an historic sell-off. They did, as we later found out, as big as September 11. Sentiment improved, slightly and when the price hit three quid, I opened a further position, eight times bigger than my earlier one. I sold before close at 316p. Monday, for me at least, was a good day.Yesterday was not as easy. Banks continued the sell off and I re-bought Barclays at 302p. I also put Admiral Group on my radar. The share closed at 880p on Monday and hit a low of 779p in early trading yesterday. The share managed to bounce from the low and late in the morning was showing 823p. I set myself a target price of 815p and waited.The big question yesterday was: Will AIG survive? The share may look like a steal but they do need to raise $70bn (
