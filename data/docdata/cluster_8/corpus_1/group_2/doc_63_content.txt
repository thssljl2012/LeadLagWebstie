The collapse of Northern Rock last year focused minds on the safety of our savings.The pictures of anxious customers queuing to withdraw their cash from the Rock remain among the most familiar illustrations of the credit crunch, with thousands of people desperate to get their hands on their money in case the bank folded and left them with nothing.As a result, there has been widespread publicity about protecting your money, with the main thing to remember being that savers with more than 35,000 need to spread their cash around.The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) - which covers all banks and building societies registered by the Financial Services Authority - will pay out up to 35,000 in the extremely unlikely event of a bank going bust.There are some strings attached, however.That figure of 35,000 is per person, per institution.So if you have two savings accounts at the same bank with 20,000 in both of them, you would only be guaranteed 35,000 if the bank went under.The waters are muddied slightly further if there are joint accounts involved.Because the limit is per person, joint account holders get double the protection.But it remains important to spread your resources around carefully.Imagine that Mr and Mrs Smith have 70,000 in savings between them at the same bank. There is 30,000 in a joint account while Mr Smith has 40,000 in his own name.The way they have spread out their money would work against them.Mrs Smith's share of the money would be half of the joint account - in this case 15,000.Mr Smith's share would be the other half of the joint account, plus his 40,000 - in other words, 55,000.But he would only be entitled compensation of 35,000, so the couple between them would receive payouts totalling only 50,000.In this example, the couple would have been better off putting the entire 70,000 into the joint account.That would have seen them both able to claim 35,000 in compensation if the worst happened.The other thing to bear in mind is that if you initially invest 35,000, once you receive interest on your balance, it will take you over the 35,000 threshold, and you stand to lose that extra money if the worst eventually happens.Several bank customers have contacted the EDP this week to see how the Lloyds TSB takeover of HBOS will affect them.The situation is not yet clear.The rules state that savers are covered per institution, not per bank.That means, for example, that if HSBC and its subsidiaries were to collapse, your cover would extend to a maximum of 35,000 saved anywhere within the group, which includes First Direct, for example. Although First Direct trades under its own name, the entire HSBC group has one authorisation with the FSA, meaning the regulator treats all its subsidiaries as a single institution.But when Royal Bank of Scotland bought Natwest a few years ago, the two brands continued to have separate authorisations with the FSA. That means savers who have 35,000 in RBS and another 35,000 in Natwest would receive two payouts if that group went under.So the question now is whether Lloyds TSB and HBOS will be covered separately or whether the FSCS will regard them as a single entity. That won't be decided for a little while yet, but if you have savings in both Lloyds TSB and HBOS, or any of their various subsidiaries, you would do well to keep an eye on developments.
