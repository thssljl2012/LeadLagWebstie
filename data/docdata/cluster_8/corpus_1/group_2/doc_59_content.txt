 Harriet Harman has accused rebels of 'an error of judgment' for demanding a leadership election.The Labour Deputy Leader sprang to Gordon Brown's defence after a poll showed the majority of party activists want him to stand down. A survey of party members found that 54 per cent would prefer another leader to steer them into the next general election.In a further blow to the Prime Minister's authority, 57 per cent said there should be a leadership vote at the Labour Conference in Manchester, which starts tomorrow.Ms Harman told BBC One's Question Time that an internal contest would be 'completely wrong' in the current economic crisis.Dismissing the survey as just 'one poll', she said: 'If people are worried about their job or worried about their savings, the idea that we say our priority is to have an internal leadership election ... people would think that was completely wrong.On the activists, she said: 'I think that they are making an error of judgment.'Ms Harman refused to say whether she would stand in any leadership election, insisting the question was hypothetical.'I don't think there is going to be a leadership election, I don't think there should be a leadership election,' she said.'I don't want any of my colleagues to have to start engaging in discussion about a hypothetical leadership election which is not going to happen, so I'm not going to start.'

Just 28 per cent of rank-and-file members said a new leader would damage Labour's chances, while 27 per cent said a change of leadership wouldn't make any difference at the polls. Grassroots supporters gave Mr Brown a lowly 4.3 out of 10, a rating lower than every other member of the Cabinet except for Chief Whip Geoff Hoon (4.12) and Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly (4.07).  Health Secretary Alan Johnson scored the highest approval rating with 6.18, followed by Secretary of State for Environment Hilary Benn with 5.91 and Justice Secretary Jack Straw with 5.71. The poll of 788 Labour members was conducted by LabourHome.org on behalf of the Independent newspaper, between September 15 and 18.Critics believe there will be an attempt to remove Mr Brown if Labour loses the Glenrothes by-election in Fife, expected in November.Alex Hilton, the editor of LabourHome, said: 'It's a real concern that a small majority of Labour members and supporters want Gordon Brown to step aside, though this poll was taken before it was clear the role the Prime Minister had played in the merger of Lloyds-TSB and HBOS.'
