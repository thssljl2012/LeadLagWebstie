This prospect has worried Bank Machine.'It is further proof of the banks' commitment to killing off cash' says Delnevo. 'They are already orchestrating the demise of cheques in the UK, despite the fact that over 25 million of us issued personal cheques last year, and their next project is to arrange a similar fate for cash.''This stands in direct conflict with the wishes of the British public who used cash for 60% of purchases last year. If left unchecked, banks could virtually phase cash out in as little as 10 years.'Recent research carried out by academics at New York and Maryland Universities claimed that shoppers are prepared to pay significantly more when they knew that they were able to pay by card, which, Delnevo says, 'means that the contactless capers of the card issuers fly in the face of consumer interest.'But Barclays has experienced growing interest in the technology since the launch of their contactless OnePulse card last year, and has said that consumers are keen on the idea.'Thousands are now experiencing the benefits of this secure and convenient payment method' says Elizabeth Chambers, Chief Marketing Officer at Barclaycard. 'Both retailers and customers have shown confidence in our brand and in contactless technology.'WANT TO KNOW MORE?READER COMMENTS (0)No comments have so far been submitted.
