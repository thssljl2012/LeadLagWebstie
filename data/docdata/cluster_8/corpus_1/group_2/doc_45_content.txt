HEADLINE: In scary times, advertisers try to craft a reassuring message; CRISIS ON WALL STREETBYLINE: Stephanie Clifford and Stuart Elliott - The New York Times Media GroupDATELINE: NEW YORKEarly last week, as American International Group began to crumble, marketing executives at a large competitor, New York Life Insurance, huddled in a series of meetings.They already had an advertising campaign running, but they sensed an opportunity to capitalize on the fast-changing conditions of their industry.On Thursday, after a presentation to the company's chief executive, Theodore Mathas, the marketing executives at New York Life won approval for an additional campaign. They dispatched their agency, Taxi, to create ads that would play up the reliability of New York Life.''At a time when well-known brands have gone by the wayside, we want to distinguish New York Life from the public companies and others that have had such difficulty,'' said William Werfelman, first vice president at New York Life.''It's now a matter of very quickly developing creative'' content to react to the market shifts, he added.New York Life is one of several financial advertisers seeking to take advantage of the economic turmoil. But the uncertainties spawned by the unprecedented events are raising flags of caution among U.S. advertising firms as executives worry that no amount of advertising will reassure an anxious public.''In the last couple weeks, you could smell the fear in New York,'' said Martin Sorrell, chief executive at WPP Group, which owns agencies like Grey, JWT and Ogilvy &amp;amp; Mather. ''Institutions that were regarded as invincible have gone down or had to be bailed out.''The scale and the speed of all that have shaken people's confidence,'' he added, and it could affect attitudes ''for the rest of the year going into next year.''The biggest challenge, executives say, is trying to keep up with the stunning economic and financial events and the resulting mood swings. Those make it difficult to determine how best to persuade shoppers to open their wallets.''Right now, there are nothing but question marks,'' said David Sklaver, president at KSL Media, a media planning and buying agency.''Every time you think all the shoes have dropped on Wall Street, another one drops,'' he added.The result is that ''we have to batten down the hatches for the near term,'' Sklaver said. ''For every client, it's constantly trying to understand who their best customer is, and building a fence around that customer, treating that customer better than ever before.''One lesson learned of late, Sklaver said, is that advertisers and the media can no longer ''treat the wealthy as a mass market'' - that is, expect robust growth to continue indefinitely in sales of high-end products like luxury goods at upscale stores.''Premium products were unassailable,'' Sklaver said, but the trouble on Wall Street suggests that ''they're not enough to support the economy.''The decline in sales of expensive items has been one factor contributing to a slowdown in demand this year for commercial time and advertising space in the United States, even with the stimulation of the quadrennial effect of the Summer Olympic Games and the presidential election.For instance, Nielsen Monitor-Plus, a division of Nielsen, reported last week that ad spending in the first half of 2008 fell 1.4 percent from a year earlier. The laggards included ads in national magazines, down 3.1 percent; national newspapers, down 8.1 percent; and spot radio, down 10.1 percent.''The health of the advertising economy depends on the health and vigor of consumer spending,'' said Jon Swallen, senior vice president for research at TNS Media Intelligence, a unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres, which will announce Tuesday its data for the first half of this year.''To the extent the financial mess forestalls a general economic recovery and makes consumers feel antsy,'' Swallen said, ''a recovery in ad spending is being pushed farther out into the future.''Another reason ad spending may decline is the shake-up in the ranks of the financial marketers. Although companies like Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch are not major advertisers, the extent of changes, including potential mergers and consolidations, among those that are ''could in the long term mean less money spent,'' Swallen said.For some, that is also the case in the short term. For example, AIG decided to discontinue its brand and corporate ads, which carry the theme ''The strength to be there'' - a message clearly thrown into question by its bailout by the U.S. government.The AIG business units are still advertising products like auto insurance, said Charlie Armstrong, senior director for advertising and global branding at AIG. For the AIG brand, he added, ''we are actively exploring messages and communications that would be appropriate for this environment.''Still, New York Life is not the only financial marketer to increase its advertising presence.An ad for Rockefeller &amp;amp; Co., the asset management firm, promises ''Responsible and stable wealth management through turbulent times.''An ad for Wachovia Securities asks investors to ''Think long term,'' adding: ''After 120 years, it's second nature to us.''
