Weve worked closely with the city council and Liverpool Vision to ensure that the scheme is in keeping with the existing architecture in this area of Liverpool.The 151-bedroom hotel will be operated under the Hampton by Hilton brand, which is the firms vehicle to enter the economy hotel market. Hampton by Hilton Liverpool City is only the third to be commissioned in the UK, with others planned for Corby and Birmingham.A Hilton spokesperson said: Liverpool is a key location as we seek to introduce the Hilton family of hotels in the UK.It is part of Hiltons ambition to double the number of hotels it has in the UK to 150 within a decade. It will be run as a franchise by Somerston Hotels.The hotel is due to open at the end of 2009. The 1.5-acre Kings Dock Mill development, which is on the former site of flag manufacturers Porter Bros, is due to be completed in January 2010.In July the Daily Post revealed how a neighbouring site at the Baltic Triangle is likely to be left semi-derelict for years after a marketing campaign to 800 developers failed to find a buyer.The site, spanning The Strand and Hurst Street, was destined to be the first part of the development, a 50m high-rise apartment scheme.Administrators were brought in to determine the future of the Baltic Triangle site last spring, after a legal wrangle between developers, Windsor Developments (Liverpool) and contractors Laing ORourke.
