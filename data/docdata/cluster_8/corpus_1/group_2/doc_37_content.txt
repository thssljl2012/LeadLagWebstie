Bankom, the inter-bank ATM payment systems company, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Kenswitch, a Kenyan concern doing the same business, which will see both integrate their switches, allowing cross-border ATM transactions by banking customers from both countries.Currently, Bankom has four banks (DFCU, CIB, Finance Trust, CMF and Orient) on its switch while KenSwitch, connects 22 banks in Kenya with a network of more than a 100 ATMs.Once the two companies interface their switches, all the customers of Bnkoms partner banks would be able to withdraw their money from any ATM of any of the banks on Kenswitch once they are in Kenya and vice versa.The development will bring tremendous convenience particularly for business people traveling in both countries who will now be able to access their money instantly as if they were home.In an interview, Mr Ben Mogaka, Bankoms Sales and Marketing Manager, said they expected to finish the work of integrating the switches within the first quarter of 2009 upon which customers would be expected to start using the service. Once we achieve this then we will have reached a stage where even big banks here will realize they need to partner with us, he said.Since Bankom launched its service four years ago it has struggled to get big banks like Stanbic, Barclays and Stanchart on its switch in vain with these institutions wary that small banks that have few or even no ATMs would use the Bankom interface to gain leverage on their wider network of ATMs at their own expense.An interconnection of Bankom and Kenswitch though would bring a significant new strategic advantage that even big banks like Stanbic would want to tap into since their customers would also now have instant access to their money while traveling to Kenya.Even then, Mr Mogaka said big banks need not wait for that development to join Bankom, arguing that they were already denying their customers broader convenience in  accessing their money by not hooking up to switch. Look, if a bank like Stanbic joined us, they would instantly increase their ATM network access by 30 per cent without any cost to them, he said.Bankom has already embarked on an expansion programme and expects to have up to 50 ATMs by the end of the first quarter on of next year. The entire Bankom switch now has about 30 ATMs of which it owns ten while the rest belong to DFCU, Orient, and CIB.Bankom recently procured their own switch and installed a new software Postilion and for the last several months the company has been migrating their customers onto the new platform. This process is expected to be complete by the close of this year.When up and running, again, Mr Mogaka said they intend to roll out a couple of new value added services on their network including Point of Sales payment service, payment of utility bills, airtime loading and suchlike.
