But when council worker Ray Michael tells the joke in future years, he'll be able to talk from personal experience.He ordered a mozzarella and tomato tart from the canteen at the council's Waverley Court HQ and, as he tucked in, he discovered an inch-long moth in the heart of the dish.The 28-year-old, who is temping in the children and families department, said: 'I couldn't believe it, my eye caught the end of the fork and I saw what looked like a flea or a moth which had clearly come from the meal. I was a fair bit through it when I saw it.'I put it down straight away and complained to the canteen staff, who were horrified and very apologetic.'The food came pre-packed from Brake Brothers Food, based in Kent, and it is likely the insect entered the meal long before it arrived at council headquarters.Both the council and the company have acknowledged the issue and are investigating to see what exactly happened.'I'm just relieved I didn't eat it, and it'll make me think twice before eating that kind of thing again. It may have just been a one-off, but it was pretty frightening,' added the graduate photographer from Blackhall.While Mr Michael was satisfied with the way the council canteen staff dealt with the issue, he was less complimentary about Brake Brothers' attitude.He has been seeking an explanation from the company since the incident took place on Wednesday and is still waiting.He said: 'I'm pretty annoyed with them to be honest, they say they can't deal with me because I'm not a customer, but as far as I'm concerned I paid for the meal and am at the end of the chain so that is not good enough.'I believe they've got a fairly good name so I was expecting more. I would like to know how that came to be in my lunch.'The insect is currently being held by the council as it waits to send it off in a special package to the suppliers.It is not the first incident in the Capital of people finding foreign bodies in their food. Kate Dunlop, 27, a personal assistant at Lloyds TSB, had to spit out a frog found in a Scotmid salad last year.A council spokeswoman said: 'This is an unfortunate incident as we aim to provide our staff with safe food of the highest quality. The item of food concerned was packaged and bought in and we are investigating it fully with our suppliers.'A spokeswoman for Brakes Brothers said: 'We are aware of the matter and are investigating.'IT is a gag usually associated with soup ordered in a restaurant.
