A project has been launched in North Devon and Torridge to help young people who may have never had a bank account to manage money and avoid financial crisis.The MoneyWise project is being run by Barnstaple Poverty Action Group, which has joined forces with high street bank Barclays to help those aged 16-25 who are not in employment, training or education.It came about after BPAG manager Phil Davey spotted an article in the North Devon Gazette about Barclays inviting local organisations to apply for grants to fund schemes aimed at helping young people with money. The bank has provided funding of 25,000 and staff from local branches have volunteered their time to work with those who need advice and guidance.The project was launched at the office of North Devon Council chairman, Councillor Roy Lucas - the council representative who works with BPAG - by North Devon MP Nick Harvey.There are many who do not have a bank account or have been shown how to use day-to-day services most take for granted, such as direct debits, paying bills and budgeting.Other examples include the pitfalls of doorstep lending, understanding interest charges and how to use community banking services such as credit unions.'Most of our services work on the understanding that prevention is better than cure and the impact of poor financial skills can be as damaging to the lives of young people and their families as poor literacy or numeracy,' said Phil Davey.'We see the tragedy of homeless people on a daily basis and are determined to prevent as many as possible from reaching that stage.'MoneyWise will be delivered by BPAG and Barclays, working with organisations which routinely deal with young people.Assistance and instruction will come from face-to-face sessions, either individually or in groups. Those already in a financial difficulties will be able to receive debt management help.The aim is also to increase the awareness and skills of those professionals working with young people, to ensure the project and its work continues in to the future.Kate Andrews, manager of the Barnstaple branch of Barclays, said: 'This is about bringing our expertise to people who might never have walked into a bank before.'If someone doesn't understand finance, even things such as cash points or how to manage their personal budget, we can show them.'Nick Harvey congratulated those behind the project and said often those who were excluded from basic financial knowledge and services tended to end up being excluded from everything: 'As an MP people tend to come to me when it's all going wrong, so I do see issues such as houses being repossessed or the threat of bailiffs,' he said.'So helping people make their way in the worlds and understanding finances and the services available has got to be worthwhile.'Barnstaple Poverty Action Group is at Commercial House on the Strand and can be contacted on (01271) 343111.
