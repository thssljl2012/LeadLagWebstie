: Stevedoring companies and dockers, dealing with sugar, rice and fertiliser cargo handling at Karachi Port, are holding talks to revise the 'Incentive Norms' formula to provide relief to workers and enhance capacity.The two sides have already reached an understanding last week to revise the normal wages-oriented tonnage, under the so-called incentive norms, by 30 tonnes or 25 percent from 120 tonnes (2,400 bags) to 90 tonnes (1,800 bags) on the handling of cement cargo.It would be important to mention here that the wage regime of dockers at Karachi Port comprises two parts, the normal and the overtime. Under the Karachi Dock Labour Board (KDLB) Scheme 1973 the longshoremen must handle 132 tonnes of fertiliser, 125 tonnes of rice and the same quantity of sugar that constitutes a part of their basic monthly pay, ahead of overtime period.The dockers' monthly basic pay, which also includes the normal wages of an on-duty labourer, is around Rs 5,400 for the night shift and Rs 4,950 for daily duty. According to sources a meeting of the Incentive Committee, to be held at KDLB Board Room on Wednesday (today) at 11 am, would revise 'Incentive Norms' for the labourers on the handling of sugar, rice and fertiliser cargo at Karachi port.They said the committee comprises Captain Tariq Masood (convenor), Sabir Hussain, Mohammad A. Rajpar, President MM Towers Rear Admiral Hamid Khalid (Retd.), Captain Mohammad Afzal of Pakistan National Shipping Corporation, Mohammad Hilal and S.M Ajaz of Karachi Harbour and Dock Workers Union, Collective Bargaining Agent (KHDWU-CBA), Gul Mohammad Afridi, Hussaini Paryal and Ahmed Saeed.President Friends Corporation Limited (FCL) Saleem Vohra and President Badruddin Stevedores (BS) Mohammad Riaz will represent the stevedoring companies at the meeting, said the sources.They said the meeting will also approve minutes of the last meeting, held on August 21, in which the two port users had developed a consensus on cutting the normal tonnage by 25 percent. At Wednesday's meeting, the sources said, the dockers would try to convince the stevedoring firms to reduce the normal tonnage on the handling of rice, sugar and fertiliser by at least 30 tonnes.At present, the dockers are bound to handle 167.5 tonnes (1,675 bags of 100kg) and 125 tonnes (3,300 bags of 25-50kg) of rice and 132 tonnes (2,640 bags of 50kg) of fertiliser as normal, said the sources. As for the sugar cargo handling, they said, the labourers have to load 125 tonnes (2,500 bags of 50kg) and discharge 132 tonnes (2640 bags of 50kg) of sugar for completing the normal period.According to sources the revision was important, as restrictive measures, like banning the use of hooks in handling the rice cargo etc, had already slowed the pace of work. Further, they said a mere 18-member gang on rice ship was also insufficient to undertake a speedy and safe handling of the exportable commodity. These factors were certainly putting negative impacts on all the stakeholders at Karachi port with trade of these commodities being hit hard, added the sources.
