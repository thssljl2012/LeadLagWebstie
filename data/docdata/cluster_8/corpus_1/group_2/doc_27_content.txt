A bank clerk from Enfield who was at the centre of an 'alarmingly simple' 500,000 identity fraud against customers has been jailed for 18 months.Economics graduate Ruth Akinyemi, 23, passed on the personal details of eight Barclays account holders enabling co-conspirators to plunder their funds.Akinyemi was 18 when she first took part in the scam, helping steal more than 100,000 from a single customer.When the bank received a tip-off about her activities she was investigated but later cleared of suspicion, the Old Bailey heard.The woman she helped to defraud had not even realised that the money was missing and so had not reported the fraudulent transaction.Judge Anthony Morris told Akinyemi: 'Instead of taking this as a warning that you should stop this dishonesty you carried on, no doubt thinking you got away with it on this occasion.'Akinyemi, who had been a customer co-ordinator at the Enfield branch of Barclays, then moved to St Albans, where she targeted seven more people living in the N1 postcode area of Islington.This second fraud, involving the theft of more than 100,000, took place between January and March 2005.Akinyemi was paid at least 3,000 for her role in the scam, part of a larger conspiracy which netted 500,000.Most of the money has not been recovered and the masterminds behind the conspiracy have never been caught.Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.
