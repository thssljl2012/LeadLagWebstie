STILL not a smidgeon of real contrition from Andy Hornby, HBOS's chief executive who, despite his failure, will do very nicely, thank you, out of the deal with Lloyds TSB.But then, as he told his staff by email: 'It's been the most emotional and tiring week in my working life.'Sob. Let's have a whip round for a pack of paper hankies for the man.But hey, it's not all bad, because it has also been a pretty lucrative week for Andy Pandy, what with that 2million he's trousering from Lloyds along with a nice, new, safe job.I'm sure knowing Andy's doing OK will be an enormous comfort to all the thousands of ordinary HBOS staff who are now faced with redundancy.They've certainly been emailing and telling me they could see what was going wrong not just months, but years ago, when HBOS began selling mortgages and loans in the way Andy used to sell baked beans at ASDA.Pile 'em high and sell 'em cheap.Meantime, over in the States, they've brought in the FBI.They will investigate whether it was sheer incompetence or a deliberate wrong which contributed to America's - and by extension, our own - financial meltdown. They have already launched a stonking 500 prosecutions against the mortgage brokers and the appraisers, who wildly over valued property which landed low-income US borrowers, the sub-primers, with loans they had no hope of ever paying off.Now the G men are getting their teeth into the Wall Street fat cats who bankrupted Lehman Brothers, caused crisis at the giant insurance company AIG and who - as one Congressman bitterly said - brought Communism in everything but name to the US after Freddy Mac and Fannie Mae were nationalised by Bush.The FBI have a decent track record when it comes to corporate malpractice and although it was small consolation for those who lost everything when Enron collapsed back in 2001, at least they saw those responsible in handcuffs.Not for one single second am I suggesting Hornby did anything illegal.But I wouldn't mind seeing him, if not in handcuffs, then on the box, being grilled by someone such as Paxman and explaining exactly where it all went pear-shaped and how, on his watch, an honourable Scottish institution, which lasted for more than 300 years, was killed off.It wasn't all down to the short sellers, Andy or indeed Smart Alex.The result is not just an emotional and tiring week ahead for HBOS staff, but months of fear and uncertainty.It isn't hankies Hornby needs, but Brasso for his neck.'I wouldn't mind seeing him being grilled by Paxman, explaining where it all went wrong'
