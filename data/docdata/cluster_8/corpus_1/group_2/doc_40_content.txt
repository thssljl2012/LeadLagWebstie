Volvos Wales and West Truck and Bus Centre has been bought out by its management team with the help of an entirely Birmingham-based team of advisers and funders.The deal, which was for an undisclosed sum, saw the formation of a new company - WW Truck and Bus - to acquire the trade and assets of Volvo Truck and Bus Centre Wales and West from Warwick-based Volvo Group UK.The business, which has 200 employees and turnover of 50 million, trades from eight sites across Avon, Somerset, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire and South Wales and provides aftermarket parts and servicing of trucks and buses as well as new truck sales.The WW Truck and Bus management team is led by managing director Billy Nairn who held various positions within Volvo Group UK before being given responsibility for the Wales &amp;amp; West region.His team, which also comprises aftermarket director Richard Millar, sales director Andrew Long and finance director Jeff Clarke, significantly improved the performance of the business over a three-year period.Mr Nairn said: Since the team came together in 2005 we have improved business performance through focusing on customer relationships and providing excellent quality service.Our working relationship with Volvo Group is excellent and we look forward to continuing to work closely together.Martyn Pilley, corporate finance partner, led a Grant Thornton team in Birmingham assisted by manager Richard Thomas.Mr Pilley said: WW Truck &amp;amp; Bus starts off with a strong order book for new trucks as a result of the backlog created by the recent implementation of the Euro 4 emission standards.Coupled with a management team that is vastly experienced in this sector and a supportive funder, the business has the ingredients for success.The advisory team also comprised BPE Solicitors, led by Paul Wakefield, who acted as legal advisers to WW Truck and Bus and the management team while Simon Woodcock of Lloyds TSB Commercial Finance and Charles Innes of Lloyds TSB Corporate Markets structured a debt package.Volvo was advised by Antony Walsh of Eversheds acting with Tony McGreal, company secretary/group solicitor of Volvo Group UK Limited while Naomi Tudor of Martineau provided legal advice to Lloyds TSB.Volvo Group UK is part of AB Volvo of Sweden, one of the worlds leading truck and bus manufacturers.Volvo Group UKs new managing director Gran Nyberg said: We are delighted to see Billy and his team take on this new challenge and wish them every success in their new venture.This business has grown significantly over recent years and customer satisfaction levels have also grown substantially.
