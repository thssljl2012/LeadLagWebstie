KEN DONE'S bid to win back some of his personal fortune may have hit a snag, after his attempts to claim on his accountant's malpractice policy were rejected by an insurance company.The artist had hoped to claim against the $7 million policy taken out by his former accountant, Gary Taylor, of Bentley Barton, to claw back some of the $53 million he lost between 2001 and 2005 in a series of small investments.But Allianz Australia has stated in court documents that it would reject the claim because an 'exclusion clause' in the fine print means it is not responsible for his losses. It says the policy is invalid 'where the losses caused by the accountants' wrongdoing related in any way to a decrease in the value of any investments'. The fine print states 'we are not liable to indemnify you . . . in consequence of: (a) depreciation (or failure to appreciate) in value of any investments'. The insurer will outline its arguments in a pre-trial hearing in the Federal Court today and tomorrow.Done argues that if his money had been invested properly by his accountant and advisers, he would now have a trust fund worth $61.5 million. Instead, he has been left with $8 million.It is alleged that his nest egg was whittled away on risky loans and stakes in untested and little-known companies that failed.They included a stake in two soccer teams - the Northern Spirit and the Central Coast Mariners - a beauty spa, a catering company and an obscure Maltese biotechnology company.Done is suing Mr Taylor, but he is not able to retrieve any of the lost money from Mr Taylor because he was made a bankrupt last September, nor can he retrieve money from Bentley Barton because it is in liquidation.Done, 67, is relying on succeeding against Allianz, or against the Commonwealth Bank, whose financial services arm, Financial Wisdom, advised him.The bank denies it is responsible for his losses.Done says he gave Mr Taylor strict ground rules on what his money could be invested in, saying he wanted only between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of his funds in 'speculative shareholdings', with all remaining funds in blue-chip stocks.Mr Taylor has not filed a defence in the case.
