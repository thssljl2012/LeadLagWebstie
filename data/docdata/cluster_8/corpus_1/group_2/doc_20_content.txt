The problems facing financial service firms and their officers are creating worries downstream at arts and non-profit groups that are often recipients of generous executive donations and gifts from the companies themselves.The crisis could cripple the efforts of many non-profits. With fewer dollars coming in the door, some will close or consolidate with other like groups.The Associated Press reports troubled firms like Lehman Brothers, now in bankruptcy, were big players in altruistic circles. They donated $39 million to U.S., European and Asian causes this past year. A college in Atlanta was pledged $10 million to establish a center for global finance.Even before this week's market meltdown, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were major players on the philanthropic scene. Freddie Mac's foundation alone had given nearly $350 million in the last 16 years. Insurance giant AIG also was a player. They donated to charities throughout the world.In 2007 Americans donated more than $300 billion to charities with three fourths coming from individuals, 7.6 percent from bequests, 12.6 percent from foundations and 5.1 percent from corporations.The AP reports dropoffs during downturns in the economy during recessionary years since 1967 averages one percent.
