 Editor-i would like to respond to your recent article where it was reported that a sleeping guard dropped his gun accidentally and the customers lining to withdraw money got injured by stray bullets. I am a frequent banker with Barclays Luwum street. On a number of times i have found the police officer (last time i checked it was a woman) with a gun on her laps but its nozzle pointing in the banking hall! Can't security agencies or the Police itself have its security personnel re-trained periodically to keep them alert at all times? Derrick Kabenge dnsimbi15@hotmail.com
