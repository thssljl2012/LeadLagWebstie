The Mid-Ohio Foodbank will be a different nonprofit a year from now.The organization, which distributes food for about 43,000 meals a day in a 20-county region, unveiled details of a $16 million capital campaign this week that will fund the renovation of a 175,000-square-foot facility in Grove City. Thats nearly three times the space at its 65,000-square-foot facility on West Mound Street.Renovation of the new facility, which the food bank expects to move into a year from now, already has $10 million of the $16 million funded, principally through gifts from major corporate donors including Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., American Electric Power Company Inc. (NYSE:AEP), Limited Brands Inc. (NYSE:LTD) and Battelle, said Matt Habash, the organizations president and CEO. That leaves the organization a year to raise the remaining $6 million.With the additional space, Habash said the food bank will be able to accommodate more volunteers, a waiting list for which is backed up by about three months.But space isnt the only concern, said Jen Bowden, manager for the food banks Campaign to Sustain. Tripling the overall size of the facility, a former mattress factory, will allow the food bank to triple the amount of its space for refrigerated and frozen goods, which theyre aiming to get into more families hands.Cans of beans are wonderful ... but variety is something we always want to be able to offer, she said.The food bank has an operating budget of about $8 million and distributes about $22 million in food annually. Its service territory extends from west of Franklin County to the West Virginia border.
