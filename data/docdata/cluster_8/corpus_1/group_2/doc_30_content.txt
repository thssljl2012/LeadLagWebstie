Hastings police have laid a dangerous-driving charge against a 'stupid' motorist who hit three vehicles after running a red light in central Hastings yesterday. Senior Sergeant Mike Stevenson of the Hastings police said officers had spoken to the 48-year-old Rotorua man after he had initially tried to park on roadworks. Mr Stevenson said after being told to move on, the man drove down the road and through a red light at the intersection of Karamu Rd and Queen St, crashing into three cars. He said the man was not drunk but would face a dangerous-driving charge. Minutes earlier, roadworks contractors noticed the man had illegally parked his car in the centre of a roundabout on Heretaunga St, before walking over to a bar. 'He only moved the car a few feet, got out and walked into the ANZ bank.' Witnesses said the man, acting 'very strangely, like he was on something', got back in his car before being pulled over by police. 'Even after that he sped off towards the Queen St intersection, and that's where he collided with the other cars,' one witness said. Waiting at the intersection just after finishing an exam was St John's College student Henry Logan. 'I saw the car coming towards me. It was hit from the side and spun around before it hit another car, finally ending up wedged against mine,' Mr Logan said. The driver is due to appear in the Hastings District Court next week.
