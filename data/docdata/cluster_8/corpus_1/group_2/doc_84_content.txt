Hope for Howard: the 'people impact' at HBOS'Undoubtedly, we will have some redundancies, some overlap, but the way we have dealt with this in the past in both organisations has really been with voluntary redundancies, attrition, and so on so I think the people impact, if you will, is going to be very minimal.'Eric Daniels, Lloyds TSB chief executive, plays down compulsory redundancy fearsIf only Wall St had asked China'The US crisis today would be China's tomorrow if financial products such as securitisation are introduced without proper risk-controlled measures.'Wu Xiaoling, former central bank deputy governorThe secret of Lloyds' future success'Oh we're still boring'Mr Daniels offers an inspirational vision of the merged companyWhat?
