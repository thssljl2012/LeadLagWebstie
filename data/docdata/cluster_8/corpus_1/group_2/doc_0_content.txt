 AIG Life is moving its group insurance service online with eForm, an application process that will reduce administration workload and increase the number of applications that can be instantly approved.The eForm gathers all the mandatory underwriting required by AIG Life during the initial application for cover by a member. In addition, the online application form will reduce the amount of work for administrators.The firm's members are able save' at any point during the application process and complete the application over time. Fund administrators can get back specific copies of eForm which was submitted earlier using a search function.The application process is being rolled out in two phases. The first phase, which is launched on 13 October, allows members to sign and date printed copy of eForm and post it to the fund administrator where it is verified and then sent to AIG Life.The second phase, which launches in February next year, allows members to complete an eForm online by logging onto the fund's website, AIG Life and the fund administrator then verify the member's eligibility.However, once the second phase occurs, the eForm will not require a signature and members will be able to simply complete the online form on the fund's website.
