  Entrepreneurs are ready to bounce back from the stigma of failure and try again, says Barclays.Research for the bank shows that almost nine out of 10 would be ready to pick themselves up and try again if their existing enterprise went under.Barclays characterises the enthusiasm as an example of the 'British Bulldog spirit' at a time when small businesses are under growing pressure as the economic downturn gathers pace.Most of the 500 small business owners surveyed felt that failure would be a 'positive experience' and said they would be ready to try again within four months of their existing venture either going under or being sold.Almost three out of four said they would be less likely to make the same mistakes the second time round, but conceded that their first failure would be a bitter, emotional blow.Entrepreneurs in Wales and the West Midlands show the most enthusiasm, ready to have another go within three months of failure.Overall, more than a quarter of those involved in the survey had run more than one business. A third of them said their business had ended because it had run out of steam, while a fifth had sold out.John Davis, managing director of Barclays Local Business, said it was heartening to know that the desire to 'bounce back' from failure was so strong in the current difficult business conditions.
