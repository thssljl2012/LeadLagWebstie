A BANK closure in Seaside will mean the loss of a cashpoint and residents being forced to travel into the town centre, the people who use it have complained.Barclays Bank, at 136 Seaside, is to shut on Friday October 17, with the cash machine being taken away.Its three staff will be transferred to other branches in the area.It will be a loss felt keenly by those who live in the area.Marie Rickman, a pensioner living in Belmore Road, said, 'It will be a shame to see the building empty like that  there is no other banking nearby, is there?'People will have to go into town, which is sad for older people, they have to get there somehow. It feels like everything is shutting down, all the doors are closing.'Keerun Proag, who works a few doors down from the bank in convenience store The Larder, said, 'We will miss the bank because it is easier for us to go there. Already the post office here has closed, it feels like services are disappearing.'There was a general consensus that people will have to travel too far for banking and cash when the building is abandoned by Barclays.Heather Ewen, 51, of Kingsmere, said, 'I should think it will be missed by people who live around here.'My partner works along here and without it he will have to go to the town centre or Langney.'It is so convenient where it is. You can just stop here and go in. It's easy to park, but without it you won't be able to do that.'Jacinta Stoddern, 48, of Beach Road, Seaside, said the bank was usually closed early in the afternoon before she finished work anyway and the hole-in-the-wall was often out of action.But she added, 'If it is working, it is quite good and I would miss how convenient it is, which the one in town is not.'A spokesman for the bank said the decision to close had not been taken lightly and was based on a lack of customer demand and the catchment area.He said, 'Customer accounts will automatically be transferred and customers are able to use our branch in Terminus Road, around half a mile away, or any of our other nearby branches including Langney and Polegate.'We also have arrangements in place to allow our personal customers to use post office facilities for paying in cash and withdrawing money and for paying bills.'
