Excluding the value of Lehman Brothers Seventh Avenue headquarters, Barclays is only shelling out $250 million for the other Lehman assets it snapped up last week when it bought the bankrupt investment bank.Thats a bargain next to the $400 million the British bank agreed to pay in early 2007 for the right for 20 years to havethe soon-to-open home of theBrooklyn Netsnamed the Barclays Center and create brand recognition.When Barclays signed the deal,it raised the questionwhy a foreign bank like Barclays, widely unknown to U.S. consumers, would spend a small fortuneon naming rights, especially since it doesnt operate retail branches.But in the past few years, financial firms have been all over arena and stadium rights.In November 2006, Citigroup agreed to pay $400 million for the naming right to the New York Mets stadium, where they start playing next year. And in January 2007, Prudential Financial paid more than $100 million for the right to name the new home of the National Hockey Leagues New Jersey Devils, which they moved into last year. The New York Post also recently reported thatBank of America, another bank that profited fromthe current crisis when it snagged Merrill Lynch last week, will likely pay for sponsorshipat the new Yankee Stadium.But one expert questioned the branding effectoflavish spending on naming rightsduring this crisis,with even strong banks running the risk ofgetting lumped in the public imagination with the otherbanks getting tax-sponsored bailouts.You are dealing withconsumers trying to figure out how failing financial institutions looking to taxpayers for trillions in bailouts have the nerve to spend millions to put their name up on an arena, said Robert Passikoff, a branding expert with Brand Keys, whose clients include the National Hockey League. One wonders whether a low profile strategy is the one that will pay off in the long run, he said.
