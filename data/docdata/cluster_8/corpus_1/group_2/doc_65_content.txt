The outcome of one of the country's longest running civil cases, the Bell Group trial, is expected to be known before the end of the month.The liquidator is trying to claw back more than $300 million plus any profits from a syndicate of 20 banks that loaned money to Alan Bond's group of companies, which collapsed in 1991.The liquidator has claimed the banks knew the company was insolvent or close to insolvency when they organised security for the loans.Among the banks being sued are Westpac, the Commonwealth, the National Australia Bank and a host of European Insitutions.The West Australian government has been funding the 17 year legal battle.Supreme Court Judge Neville Owen's finding is expected to be thousands of pages long and is tipped to be handed down within the next fortnight.The judgement comes about the same time as Alan Bond will be the guest of honour at the Royal Perth Yacht club's gala ball, celebrating 25 years since Australia won the America's Cup.
