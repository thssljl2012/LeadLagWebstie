I don't EVER recall shopping at T.J. Maxx or one of their stores.  However, as a result of their credit info snafu, Citibank VISA cancelled my credit card without my permission or knowledge and issued me a new one with an entirely different number. This totally screwed up my records!!!  I will NEVER shop at T.J. Maxx, cash, credit, or any other way!!
