Once again, credenzas are on the attack!  Yes, the snobbish sounding piece of furniture that I first got to really know during last year's Senate campaign - remember when Democrat Jeff Merkley was slammed for allowing the purchase of $3,000-and-up credenzas at the state Capitol? - is back in the news.  A 19th Century-style credenza at homelivingstyle.com.  John Thain, who ran Merrill Lynch when it was taken over in a fire sale by Bank of America, resigned under pressure Thursday after reports emerged that he had shoveled out billions of dollars of bonuses just before the B of A takeover (which, it should be noted, was greased by billions of dollars of taxpayer money).  The final straw for Thain's new bosses may also have been CNBC's report Thursday that Thain spent $1.22 million redecorating his office suite in early 2008 - just as Merrill Lynch was firing employees as the stock market headed south.  And guess what? His credenza cost $68,179, a fun fact that's all over the business news today as another example of CEO ego run wild.  In comparison, the credenzas in the state Capitol sound bargain basement. While they were more expensive than the furniture you get in boxes and have to assemble yourself, officials renovating the Capitol office wings said the new furniture - built by Oregon prisoners - was cost-effective because it's made of solid wood designed to last for decades.  Thain found another way to get a credenza that has already lasted for decades. He bought a 19th Century antique that I'm sure was quite exquisite.  As it happens, I've never even had a credenza, but I'm starting to feel better about that. Maybe they're more trouble than they are worth.  So with that in mind, I'm warning Barack and Michelle Obama: be careful in the credenza department. Turns out they've hired interior designer Michael S. Smith, who did Thain's office remodeling job, to spruce up their quarters at the White House.
