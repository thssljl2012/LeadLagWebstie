Our brilliant government spends all this effort trying to figure out how to 'get money into the hands of consumers to spend'.  Let me help.  825 billion = roughly $2400 for every person in the USA.  Send us checks please--actually I will take direct deposit.  The reason it is not that simple? Because govt is not really interested in getting the money into the hands of consumers. That is evidenced by the fact that the Democrats had 350 MILLION for contraception packed into the 'stimulus' bill.  What they really intend to do is to get government involved in dictating when and where every dime will go. The only thing that guarantees is that at least 1/3 will be wasted by the govt administering this. Then after its done--they will keep all the govt staff they hired to administer it.  I mean really--our govt tells Citibank they can't have a jet because they got bailout money. That demonstrates the stupidity of the bailout. Citi should never have got bailout money and THE GOVERNMENT HAS NO BUSINESS TELLING A COMPANY PLANE/NO PLANE!!  Companies should make their own stupid decisions AND THEN SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES--EVEN BANKRUPTCY/FAILURE!!!
