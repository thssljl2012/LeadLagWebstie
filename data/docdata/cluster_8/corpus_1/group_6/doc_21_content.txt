WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson said he received assurances today from the Treasury Secretary nominee that there will be more accountability in how the next batch of funds from the $700 billion economic bailout will be used. "I expressed to him the outrage of our folks who are losing their jobs and their homes, only to see their public money being used to remodel offices and big bonuses in the corporations that otherwise are financially shaky," the Florida Democrat said in a conference call with reporters. "Timothy Geithner's words to me were: I completely get it." Nelson is one of several senators backing legislation to better track how banks and other companies receiving some of the $700 billion rescue package are using it.   The bill would require such firms to report every three months to the Treasury Department how they spent their money. It also would ban them from using any of the funds on lobbying, political contributions, various travel expenditures and other expenses, including those related to office renovations, entertainment and holiday parties.  Nelson said he wants Geithner, who is expected to be confirmed Monday by the Senate, to focus both on rescue funds to be released under his watch as well as the previous batch spent under the Bush administration.   Nelson expressed outrage at how the ousted chief executive of the financially troubled Merrill Lynch spent $1.2 million to redecorate his Manhattan office last year. Merrill Lynch recently was purchased by Bank of America, which received about $20 billion from the federal government to help bail out Merrill's losses."Remember, these corporations are refusing to tell us what they have done with the money," Nelson said. "This is what is all the more inexcusable. This is public money. They're refusing to tell us."
