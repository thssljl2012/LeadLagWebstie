I have a question I was hoping someone could answer for me. I'm quite puzzled by this. I realize that Hamilton County is the only county, city and state in the entire United States that has not been affected by the falling home values so the answer to my question may not be known. But, here goes.  How much of the federal bailout money is being spent to foreclose on people's homes? Foreclosures are up 81% and Bank of America requires more billions of bailout money. It is obvious to me that the government is probably complicit in all of the foreclosures.   I raise my hat to the Chattanooga and Hamilton County politicians that have kept the home values rising when the whole of the U.S.A. has a crisis of home values falling.  Question number 2: How do they do it?  Bettye W. Clark
