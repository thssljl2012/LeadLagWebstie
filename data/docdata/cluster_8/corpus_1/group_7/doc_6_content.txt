BANKS will not be prevented from slugging customers with fees for using a competitor's automatic teller machine, despite concerns from consumer advocates.  The Reserve Bank said yesterday it would not cap fees in country areas nor prevent banks from charging customers for using a machine owned by another bank.   Under new ATM access rules due to start on March 3, banks will no longer pay each other a fee every time a customer uses another institution's machine. But nothing will prevent banks from charging their customers a 'foreign ATM fee'. In addition, ATM owners will be able to charge cardholders a direct fee for using their machines, provided they display the charge before the withdrawal goes ahead.   Consumer groups are worried the reforms will hurt cardholders in the bush, because of a lack of competition.   The Consumer Action Law Centre has urged the RBA to cap fees in regional areas. It also argues that banks and credit unions should be banned from charging foreign ATM fees now that they no longer have to pay an interchange fee.   Consumer advocate Choice yesterday stepped up pressure on the big banks to scrap foreign ATM fees, saying: 'The benefits of direct charging reforms will be quickly undermined if customers are charged a separate second fee from their own bank.' NAB, Westpac, ANZ and St George have already announced they will continue to charge foreign ATM fees.   The head of the RBA's payments policy department, Michele Bullock, said it was beyond the RBA's powers to cap or regulate bank fees, just as it could not dictate banks' mortgage or credit card rates.
