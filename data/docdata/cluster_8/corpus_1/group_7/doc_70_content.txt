  I am outraged by a recent letter I received from Citibank, detailing an increase in the annual percentage rate on my credit card from 10 percent to 19 percent. I have never paid my bill late and have been an excellent customer. Customer service told me that the increase is happening bankwide 'due to the current economic conditions of the country.' What a load of crap!   This bank took $45 billion in bailout money and then allowed ex-chief executive Sandy Weill to take the corporate jet to Mexico on a personal holiday and planned on spending $50 million on a second corporate jet. Not only are we the taxpayers paying for the bailout, we then are getting hit a second time by these same institutions in larger fees, rates and the like. It is madness.   Congress must stop these demons. It is charged with speaking for all Americans, not the corporate lobbyists. I am sickened by the lack of oversight and action of Congress to stop this mess, coupled with their partisan bickering. Tell your representatives to shape up and hold these corporations accountable!   Michael J. Kello   Salt Lake City
