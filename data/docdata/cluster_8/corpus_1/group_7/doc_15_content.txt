- 8:01AM More than one in five Western Australians are too dependent on debt, have little or no savings and high housing costs, a survey has found.  And another three in five are doing little better, with little in the way of savings.  The BankWest financial fitness indicator shows 22 per cent of those surveyed in the state were classed as 'financially unfit', while a further 60 per cent were 'borderline fit'. Financially unfit people were those with an over reliance on debt, little or no regular savings, no insurance and high housing costs relative to income.  Those on the borderline had moderate savings, some insurance, moderate levels of debt and average housing costs.  Just 18 per cent of respondents had regular savings, low housing costs and high asset levels relative to debt and income.  Men were one-and-a-half times more likely to be financially fit than women, while, unsurprisingly, baby boomers were the financially fittest generation. Almost 30 per cent of those aged under 43 - Generation X and Y - were financially unfit.   BankWest retail chief executive Ian Corfield told WAtoday.com.au that he was surprised by the number of WA residents in financial strife. 'Especially given the amount of money that's poured into the state in recent years, but probably what's underneath that is the increases in property prices, ' he said. The survey follows recent research showing Perth homeowners were among the most stressed in the country, with 76 per cent of income needed to service a mortgage in the city. 'We're not yet in the recession but now's the time for people to put their foot on the ball (and develop better financial habits),' Mr Corfield said. BankWest strategy and products head Selina Duncalf said many people acquired bad financial habits during the boom. 'Being financially unfit in a boom is one thing, but it's a very different proposition during the tight economic times (forecast for) the year ahead,' she said.
