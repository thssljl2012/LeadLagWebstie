)--A couple who is experiencing financial difficulties should join a credit union for help, consumer advocates said in a Baltimore Sun personal finance column Tuesday.  Two years ago, Bank of America (BofA) gave Brian DeCunzo and his wife a $40,000 unsecured line of credit--two-thirds of their annual income. However, BofA recently lowered their credit limit to $24,300. Now the couple is maxed out. A bank official told them their credit limit was lowered because their debt level had gone up, the newspaper said.   However, DeCunzo told the paper they have less debt now than when they first took out the line of credit.  While a $40,000 unsecured line of credit is very generous, the bank's sharp cut available credit was 'heavy-handed,' consumer advocates told the paper.  The DeCunzos should join a credit union to obtain more favorable credit terms, the advocates suggest.
