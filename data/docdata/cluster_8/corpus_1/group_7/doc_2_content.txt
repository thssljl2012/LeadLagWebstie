The insurer has been embarrassed by the leak of a car insurance document - describing a claimant as a 'fat chav'.  A bad-tempered riposte to a car insurance claim has become a worldwide internet sensation.  In a document submitted to insurance provider AIG, motorist James Edwards said his collision with a 'Miss Pywell' was not severe enough to cause the other driver whiplash, as she claimed. The report was subsequently leaked via email, and has been pinging into inboxes around the world ever since.  A drawing of the incident made by the irate target of the claim depicts the woman as a rotund figure sporting a baseball cap - annotated 'fat chav'. The 'injured' claimant is similarly described in Mr Edwards' accompanying text.  The report stated: 'I very slightly touched the rear bumper of the car in front. There was no damage and Miss Pywell is a fat chav who definitely does not have whiplash.'  An AIG spokesperson contacted by the Sun newspaper promised that legal action would be taken against any employee who had leaked the claim. Sensitive car insurance documents related to cases are kept confidential.  A recent rise in personal injury claims, including those for whiplash, were cited by car insurance provider Sainsbury's yesterday as a reason for the price increase in premiums expected for 2009.
