A full page ad by Bank of America essentially attempts to reassure us that BofA is financially OK, that we should continue to trust BofA with our money, and that things will be okay as we move forward. In the very same issue is a front-page story about the head of BofAs credit card operation (formerly MBNA) giving a pep talk to the Wilmington Rotary Club in which he stressed that we must have a positive attitude and that we must restore consumer confidence.   At the very same time, BofAs stock is tanking, and BofA is planning to eliminate over 30,000 jobs (but not executive bonuses).   The obvious question is: If there is so much to be positive about, why do we need all this reassurance?  The cold truth is that excessive consumer confidence is what has led to the recent explosion of consumer debt.   Given the current high levels of unemployment and home foreclosures, a large chunk of that consumer debt will never be repaid.   The last thing the country needs right now is already tapped-out and over-stretched consumers to pile on even more debt.   But that is exactly what the BofA credit card operation needs in order to stay alive.   Promoting more consumer debt in the form of credit card borrowing is going to be a dying business, simply because debt cannot be expanded indefinitely.   The chickens have finally come home to roost, and the likes of BofA know it, as more and more people are tearing up their credit cards.  Edmund Dohnert  Wilmington
