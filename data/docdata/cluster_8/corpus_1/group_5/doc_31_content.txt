CARSON CITY, Nev. -- Nevada Gov. Jim Gibbons said leaders of several major banks and mortgage landing companies have told him they're willing to modify loans to keep people in their homes.  Gibbons commented following a conference call Thursday with the lenders. Spokesman Dan Burns said the session was one of several that he has conducted.  Gibbons requested a 90-day freeze on home foreclosures in Nevada, which has the nation's highest foreclosure rate. Burns said the lenders promised to come up with 'some options and ideas' and discuss them with the governor, probably next week.  Participants in the conference call included representatives of Wells Fargo, Countrywide, Bank of America, the state Housing Division, Bank of Nevada and the Nevada Bankers Association.
