I am president and CEO of Carolina Finance, an automobile finance company I started in 2000.  We borrow our capital from Bank of America, which has pretty much stopped lending despite being given $15 billion to help small companies.  I have written Howard Coble, Richard Burr and Elizabeth Dole, asking for a loan from the TARP funds, not a handout. We have the ability to pay it back as long as we have the capital to allow us to keep making loans.   Not one of these elected officials has responded.  I have 50 employees in North Carolina and Virginia whom I care about. I do not believe the bank bailout finds are being used as intended. Our customers are working-class customers who need basic transportation and I have more than 8,000 of them.  Who is going to care for these people if I don?t?
