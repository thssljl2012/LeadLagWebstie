Tomorrow, $8.7 billion will begin flowing into six million bank accounts in the form of lump-sum payments to aged pensioners, carers, low-income families and people on the poverty line. More than 1.5 million Victorians will benefit, accounting for about $1.8 billion, or just over 21 per cent of the total.  But will people spend it? Some economists are concerned that people  especially the middle class  are starting to hoard money at a time when the economy needs them to spend. The Government's idea for the stimulus package was that bonus money would best be directed towards people who can't afford to save money at any time  because they're behind on their bills or in need of dental work or a few things for the kids with Christmas looming.  The Government is probably guessing right. Magic Barclay is a Lara personal trainer with two sons, 9 and 7, suffering autism. As a recipient of the Commonwealth Carer's Allowance ($100.60 a fortnight per child) Ms Barclay will receive a bonus of $1000 per child. The money will be immediately swallowed by unpaid therapy bills.  'Throughout the year we rack up a lot of bills for therapies to keep the kids afloat  a nutritionist, speech therapist, occupational therapist  sometimes our wages aren't enough to cover that,' she said.  'The bonus will help catch up a little bit, but we'll still be behind. It won't even hit the bottom of my purse.'  Ms Barclay believes the bonus, as a government strategy, 'is great as a stimulus. I agree with it.'  She believes that spending the money is important. 'The money has to go out there to the retail sector, everybody needs to keep trading. It's important to keep it circulating.'  John, from Carlton, a 70-plus veteran of the entertainment industry who doesn't want people to think of him as a low-income struggler, holds a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. This will earn him a $1400 bonus. Continued...
