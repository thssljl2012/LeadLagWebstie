ATM technology company ITS today announced a conference would be held in Auckland early in 2009 in an attempt to find answers to the ATM security problem.  'With the ATM skimming hitting the headlines in recent weeks in New Zealand, the problem of keeping customers' information secure is a hot topic.'  It said skimming of card data at ATMs was a massive problem globally.  In the UK skimming fraud had been estimated to cost more than 140 million (NZ$370 million) each year.  'The one day conference will draw together international experts, financial institutions, suppliers to the industry and other stakeholders in an attempt to discover the best means of combating skimming and other attacks on ATMs.'  In the latest skimming case in New Zealand, 400 customers using the ANZ National Bank's ATM on Ward St, Hamilton last month had their cards' electronic details copied by an electronic reader attached to the machine.  The criminals also kept watch for their PINs which they later used to steal cash from their accounts.  ANZ National has refused to say how much cash was stolen as a result of the deception.  - NZPA  Next Story: Chop, chop as trees come down for Christmas
