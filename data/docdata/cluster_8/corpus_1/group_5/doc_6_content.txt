The growing problem of skimming from New Zealand ATM machines has led to an industry response to fight 'technie' thieves. ATM technology company ITS announced on Sunday a conference would be held in Auckland early next year in an attempt to find answers to the ATM security problem.  It said skimming of card data at ATMs was a massive global problem.  In the UK skimming fraud had been estimated to cost more than STG140 million ($A307.42 million) every year. 'The one day conference will draw together international experts, financial institutions, suppliers to the industry and other stakeholders in an attempt to discover the best means of combating skimming and other attacks on ATMs.' In the latest skimming case in New Zealand, 400 customers using the ANZ National Bank's ATM on Ward St, Hamilton last month had their cards' electronic details copied by an electronic reader attached to the machine.  The criminals also kept watch for their pin numbers which they later used to steal cash from their accounts.  ANZ National has refused to say how much cash was stolen as a result of the deception.
