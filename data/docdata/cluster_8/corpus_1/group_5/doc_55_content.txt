Evidently, even a plea from Vice President Cheney, warning of the electoral consequences of triggering a depression, did not budge most Republican senators. Were they newly fiscally responsible? Wanted to punish Michigan, Ohio and other key auto states for voting the wrong way on November 4? Could it possibly have been as simple as they wanted the UAW to take wage cuts and not Citigroup bankers?  I defer to nobody in thinking that the U.S. auto industry has been the single most poorly managed domestic industry. It needs fundamental change. But frankly, I worry more about the economy-wide effects of bankruptcy for General Motors than I did for Bear Stearns or even Citibank.  I think the Republican senators played to their electoral base, which is almost entirely a Southern base now. They successfully forced the White House to totally change every one of its arguments against using TARP money to bail out the automakers, so that they could go home and say they acted out of principle, but without any responsibility for the outcome.  Who ever would have thought that the Bush White House would be more sensible than a group of senators?
