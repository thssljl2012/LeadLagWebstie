Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain has suggested his 2008 bonus should be around the $10 million mark. The bank, under his stewardship, only lost $11.7 billion this year before desperately selling itself to Bank of America.  How about a few years in prison for participating in actions that contributed directly to bankrupting thousands of people and throwing the markets into financial collapse, disrupting the financial stability of the U.S., affecting the entire world. Can it be treason? Walk away with a reward of millions of dollars for his actions? It could have been tar and feathers, and riding out of town on a rail in the old days. And, that's just the tip of the iceberg we're expected to swallow. Give us a break!  Who's guarding the hen house? This isn't fading away anytime soon. People are damned upset.  Will incompetent CEOs still be running the American auto industry? Or, will the government have to import some Japanese management to run the show because the talk is they can't find qualified replacements here.  And don't forget the greedy auto unions for their contributions. They could use some executives with a lot more common sense.  Bill H. May, Muskogee  Editors note: Thain has recanted his statement.
