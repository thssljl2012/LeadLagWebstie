If AIG were in the public relations business instead of insurance, it surely would have gone broke years ago.   It went ahead with $450 million in bonus payments, including $165 billion paid out over this last weekend, to executives of the business unit whose recklessness almost wrecked the company.   AIG CEO Edward Liddy said the bonuses had been contracted for pre-crash and were legally binding and this: With Treasury meddling in compensation issues, 'we cannot attract and retain the best and brightest talent to lead and staff the AIG businesses.' If there are thriving financial houses with job vacancies clamoring to hire way AIG's top talent, a lot of unemployed Wall Streeters would like to know who those firms are. So would we all.
