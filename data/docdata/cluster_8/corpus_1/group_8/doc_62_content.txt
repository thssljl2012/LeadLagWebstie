WASHINGTON - Joining a wave of public anger, President Obama blistered the giant insurer AIG for 'recklessness and greed' yesterday and pledged to try to block it from handing its executives $165 million in bonuses after taking billions in federal bailout money. 'How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat?' Obama asked. 'This isn't just a matter of dollars and cents. It's about our fundamental values.' He joined other officials in criticizing American International Group.  The bulk of the payments at issue cover AIG Financial Products, the unit that sold credit default swaps, the risky contracts that caused massive losses for AIG.  Obama had scheduled a speech yesterday to announce new help for small businesses. But first, he said, he had a few words to say about AIG. He lost his voice at one point and ad-libbed, 'Excuse me, I'm choked up with anger here.' He said he had directed Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to 'pursue every legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayer whole.' Later, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the administration would modify the terms of a pending $30 billion bailout installment for AIG to at least recoup the $165 million the bonuses represent. That would not rescind the bonuses, just require AIG to account for them differently.  Bailout steps for AIG totaling more than $170 billion since September have effectively left the U.S. government with an 80 percent stake.  Obama's sharp words continued an administration drumbeat to pressure the bonus recipients to forgo them. Thus far, AIG officials have refused to rescind the payments.  In a letter to Geithner over the weekend, the government-appointed chief executive of AIG, Edward Liddy, said the bonuses were legally binding obligations and the firm's 'hands are tied.' So far, AIG has been honoring its contracts with U.S. and foreign banks, paying out more than $90 billion in economic bailout funds to big banks and others. The government agreed to uphold the contracts when it seized control of AIG in September, contending that failure would bring even worse global economic problems.  However, Obama officials made the rounds of Sunday talk shows to denounce AIG. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke also weighed in, saying on CBS's 60 Minutes that the AIG bailout angered him the most and that he 'slammed the phone more than a few times on discussing AIG.' Still, he said its collapse would have wreaked havoc on the global economy.  The bonuses were revealed over the weekend. It also was disclosed that AIG used the $90 billion-plus in federal aid to pay foreign and domestic banks, some of which had received their own U.S. government bailouts.  The recipients included Goldman Sachs, at $12.9 billion, and three European banks - France's Societe Generale at $11.9 billion, Germany's Deutsche Bank at $11.8 billion, and Britain's Barclays P.L.C. at $8.5 billion. Merrill Lynch, which also is undergoing scrutiny of its bonus plans and which is now part of Bank of America, had received $6.8 billion as of Dec. 31.  The money went to banks to cover their losses on complex mortgage investments, as well as for collateral needed for other transactions.  Meanwhile, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said that AIG missed his deadline yesterday for providing details about employees set to receive millions in bonuses and that he was issuing subpoenas for the information.  Cuomo says his office would investigate whether the employees were involved in AIG's near-collapse and whether the $165 million in bonus payments were fraudulent under state law.
