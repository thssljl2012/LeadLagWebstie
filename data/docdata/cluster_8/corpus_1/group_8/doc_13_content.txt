Is it because AIG, that insurance conglomerate which insures all of the paychecks and retirement checks to Congress, that our Congress in its infinite wisdom have decided to give AIG another $30 billion bailout of our money? What is going on here?  If AIG cannot run its business then let the company either file bankruptcy or close its doors. Please President Obama, although I do appreciate your efforts to clean up our troubled economy after the eight-year George Bush fiasco, how about starting in your own backyard on Capital Hill and put a stop to this bailout to AIG!
