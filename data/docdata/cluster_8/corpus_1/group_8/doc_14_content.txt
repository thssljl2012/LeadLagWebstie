  I completely agree that people need not agree on everything to get along and engage in civil discourse. However, there are far too many people who ignore the facts and whose arguments are predominantly based on opinion.  For example, many attribute the current state of our economy not to specific causes (e.g. predatory lending practices that beefed up the supply side of a risky financial derivatives market), but to the change from a Republican congressional majority to a Democratic one in 2006.  One of the main reasons that the economy is currently in dire straits is the result of a logical chain of events that few saw coming but most can now appreciate in hindsight. Home mortgages have been bundled and sold as financial derivatives for many years; however, the past few years saw the rise of a house of cards whose fall has been great.  To provide an ever-higher number of mortgages that could be bundled and sold as securities around the world, bankers would embellish or lie about loan applicants and their qualifications. The risky loans behind these bundled mortgages were often insured, which pulled insurance companies such as AIG into the equation. The irresponsible lending over the past few years (yes, even before 2006), finally led to defaults that were absorbed by the banks and insurance companies. The losses suffered by the banks obliterated their profit margins, put them 'in the red' and raised the specter of failure over pretty much all of the largest banks.For there to be civil discourse, the participants should at least be informed and not stoop to partisan politics early in the discussion. The quickest way to lose one's credibility is to ignore historical context while shunning the indisputable facts and assuming causality where there is only coincidence.  Steve Hatfield   Vacaville
