Summers &amp; Geitner don't appear up to the task....or worse.  They're part of the coup that usurped government power for the benefit of the bankers.  O'Reilly had a pretty good rant going last night about the fortune being handed out to AIG, called the credit default swaps 'stupid insurance', as in, when a bank takes a stupid risk it buys insurance against it's stupidity blowing up in it's face. As AIG doesn't have the assets to pay off all the banker stupidity, it now falls to 'the folks' to pay for the stupidity.  Just a good old fashoned shake down. 'give us all the money we want, or we'll strangle the economy'Hannity has been holding forth as well. To hear Sean tell it, Obama is using 'scare tactics to frighten the people into going along with his socialist plans' Funny, when Bush used scare tactics gain public approval to overrule the Bill of Rights, Hannity praised Bush's 'keeping us safe'Steve
