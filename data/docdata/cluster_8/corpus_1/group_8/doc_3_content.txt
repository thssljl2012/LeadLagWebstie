WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. risked facing an economic depression had the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank not acted to bail out insurance giant  (AIG), Senate Majority Leader   Harry Reid  , D-Nev., said Tuesday.  Referring to the beleaguered company as a 'disaster,' Reid said that he believed the U.S. economic recession would have become a depression without the billions of dollars pumped into the firm by the federal government.  The government has risked up to $170 billion to keep the company afloat and officials have said it could cost taxpayers even more if economic conditions worsened.  Reid said this assistance was 'essential' and that he thought the Treasury had done 'a pretty good job' given the circumstances.  AIG said Monday it had taken a $61.7 billion loss in the fourth quarter, bringing total losses for 2008 to $99.3 billion. The company said its assets shrank from more than $1 trillion at the end of the third quarter to $860 billion at year-end 2008.  -By   Corey Boles  , Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6601; corey.boles@dowjones.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires 03-03-091509ET Copyright (c) 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
