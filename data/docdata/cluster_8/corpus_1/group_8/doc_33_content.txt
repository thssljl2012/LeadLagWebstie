 President Obama is known for being a cool customer. But as is the case with many Americans, the fiasco at the huge insurance firm AIG has pushed Obama to the limit.  With the news that AIG, recipient of $170 billion in federal bailout money, intends to pay executives $165 million in bonuses, the president vowed to do everything he could to stop it. That's even though the new chief executive of the company, appointed by the government, says the bonuses appear to be legally binding.  The smart thing for the executives to do, of course, would be to turn down the bonuses, immediately. But this is a company that went in the tank, remember, so don't count on the smart thing. The company, and those associated with it, have become symbols of the financial meltdown, sort of a textbook case of what happens when greed meets incompetence and the union is not chaperoned by much federal regulation.'This,' Obama said, 'is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed.' Of the bonuses specifically, he said, 'This isn't just a matter of dollars and cents. It's about our fundamental values.'It was clear the president was fed up, and for good reason. After all, with AIG behaving so badly, future stimulus efforts or other measures that may be needed to help business rise from this awful economy could be jeopardized by skepticism in Congress as to whether 'this is another AIG.'Still, it's valuable when the president shares with the people a degree of exasperation that indicates he's ready to stir the tar and pluck the feathers.
