I'll have to say, I don't think the Republicans trust anything out of Chicago these days. Too many headaches. Too many Czars.  But we all might want to take another look (I'm looking at you, Chris Dodd) at this Goolsbee guy:  Goolsbee can be Czar Anybody-But-Krugman.  Cynthia Rouse can be Czar Try-to-Close-the-Chrysler-Deal.  Bob Rubin can be Czar Citibank.
