From Main Street to Wall Street to Pennsylvania Avenue, everyone is furious with insurance giant AIG.  It got billions in bailout money, yet its handing out $165 million in executive bonuses.  Congress is preparing legislation to force AIG to hand over that money.  Lawmakers are telling AIG executives to either hand over the bonus money voluntarily, or theyll get the IRS to take it back.  What do you give to company executives who lost everything?  $165 million in bonuses of course, and congress is outraged.  Charles Schumer (d) New York, If anything defines Alice in Wonderland business practices, this is it.  Barbara Boxer (d) California, Its disgusting, its disgraceful.  And Tom McClintock  California, Honk if youre paying AIG bonuses.  The money was handed-out, company officials say, because the bonuses were negotiated before AIG received $160 billion in taxpayer bailouts; 73 executives getting over $1 million each11 no longer with the company!  Austan Goolsbee, White House Council of Economic Advisors said, Its almost like these guys should have gotten the Nobel Prize for evil.  Americans seem to agree; the internet is flooded with AIG rage and messages like burn in hell and crash and burn.  Anger fueled by old AIG commercials that live forever online and now seem to mock taxpayers, AIG Insurance Financial Services and the freedom to dare.  The president wants the bonus money returned, but may be powerless to get it; so congress has a plan.  Steve Israel (d) New York, You can run, but you cant hide. The IRS will find you and we are going to tax that money at 100% if it exceeded $100,000.  And Tim Ryan (d) Ohio said, And someone, quite frankly, has to take these people to the woodshed.  Bonus recipients may have temporarily thought they won the lottery because without taxpayer bailouts, their company wouldnt exist. Now they seem to face a stark choice give it back or soon lose it to the IRS.
