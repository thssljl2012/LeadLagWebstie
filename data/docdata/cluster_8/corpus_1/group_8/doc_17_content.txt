We have to be extremely careful about overreacting to stupidity.  You open up one heck of a can of worms when you start prosecuting CEO's who simply screwed up or got greedy.  Lying to investors is usually considered a form of fraud.  This country was built on risk and it will recover on risk. The last thing you want is CEO's afraid of making mistakes out of fear of eventual prosecution.  Let's take AIG as an example. They sold an insurance product called Credit Default Swaps that they had no intention of making good on in the event of a claim. It's a scam. People should be going to jail.  If it was a black kid selling bad weed he'd already be there.  Derek
