WASHINGTON - The White House says President Barack Obama has full confidence in Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.  Geithner has been sharply criticized over the millions in bonuses to executives of AIG, the insurance giant that has received billions in federal bailout money.  White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Tuesday that Obama is working as quickly as possible with Congress to find ways to block the bonuses at the American International Group or recoup that money.  Gibbs sought to put the focus on bigger reforms ahead.  He said Obama wants both financial regulation reform and a new 'resolution authority' to deal with giants like AIG that get into complex financial trouble.
