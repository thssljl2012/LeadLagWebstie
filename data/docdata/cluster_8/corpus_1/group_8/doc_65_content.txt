Frustration continues to build on Capitol Hill and Tuesday a local congressman got involved in the battle against insurance giant AIG.  Congressman for the fifth district Tom Periello sounded off in Washington on the tax payer dollars used to pay million dollar bonuses to 75 of A-I-G's top execs.  'These are tax payer dollars, we will protect them. These are bonuses that do not make sense in this economy, they do not make sense in basic market principles,' says Perriello.
