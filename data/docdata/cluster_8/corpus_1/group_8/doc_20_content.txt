WASHINGTON  Senior administration sources said President Barack Obama learned only last Thursday that insurance giant AIG was paying employees millions of dollars in bonuses.  The bonus pay has caused an uproar because American International Group Inc. has relied on billions of dollars of taxpayer help for survival.  The White House has faced questions about when, exactly, Obama learned that AIG executives were going to get $165 million in bonus pay.  Officials for the first time on Tuesday night said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told the White House last Thursday, and senior aides informed the president later that day.  Meanwhile, Geithner said he is working with the Justice Department to determine whether any retention bonuses paid by AIG can be recovered.  The insurance giant has received about $170 billion in government bailout funds.  Geithner has authority under the recently passed economic stimulus bill to review compensation paid to senior executives and to the next 20 most highly compensated employees of companies that have received federal assistance.  He disclosed the review of AIG bonuses in letters to congressional leaders Tuesday evening.
