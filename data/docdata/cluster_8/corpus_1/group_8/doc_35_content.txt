GREENVILLE, S.C. -- Over the past few weeks, Upstate banks have had to answers some tough, in-depth questions from an influential state legislator about their recent actions.  Sen. David Thomas asked bankers if their banks invested in any risky dealings and how the banks are keeping watch over your money.'Some banks were irresponsible, went nuts giving loans they shouldn't have given,' Sen. David Thomas of Greenville said. 'Some banks were very conservative.'  Thomas, the chairman of the Senate's banking and insurance committee, said he sat down with the CEOs and presidents of 23 Upstate banks to get an inside look. He said he was nervous about the prospect.'I wasn't sure what the outcome would be and I was pleasantly surprised,' Thomas, a Republican, said.  Thomas said that he found 90 percent of Upstate banks said they are confident of their success, even in recession, because they said they were not involved in risky deals.  There were some exceptions.'Well, you had Wachovia, you had First Citizen, with its investments in Florida, and you had Bank of America, which had its share of problems.'When asked why banks aren't lending, Thomas did not accept the premise of the question and said that most banks are perfectly willing to make loans.'Can we go out and buy a car? Yeah, you can get a car. Can we get a house? Yeah, you can get a house. Can we refinance? You can refinance. So things are there,' Thomas said.Thomas said that banks are being more careful when it comes to how much they lend and making sure that the borrower can and will pay it back.'We're in pretty good shape,' Thomas said.Thomas said that just under half of the banks that operate in the Upstate took money from the Troubled Asset Recovery Plan (or TARP).
