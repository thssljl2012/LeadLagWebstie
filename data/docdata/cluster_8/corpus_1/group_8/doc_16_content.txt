AIG CEO Edward Liddy  Reported by: Bethany Tucker, Brian Mooar, NBC News  President Obama says he's outraged, and he's not alone. Insurance giant AIG took a big $170 billion bailout from the government and decided to hand out millions of dollars in bonuses.  The insurance giant has a lot of explaining to do and will get its chance Wednesday on Capitol Hill.  President Obama says he's angry, 'I mean, how do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat?'  The White House says it's trying to see whether the bonuses can be stopped even though they are written into existing contracts.  'The President has asked Secretary Geithner and members of the administration to exhaust all legal remedies in looking backwards to see what steps could be taken to block these bonuses,' said White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs.  New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo told CNBC the government may have a decent case. 'If it wasn't for the government coming in, it would have been bankrupt and the contract wouldn't be worth the paper it was written on.'  AIG says the bonuses are needed to retain top talent. Congressional democrats disagree. 'We learned that $57 million of these dollars are going to employees who will be terminated,' said Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland.  Republicans say it's a cautionary tale, what happens when Congress tries to do too much, too quickly.  'The danger is, is are we gonna be making those same decisions at GM and Chrysler and every other business we end up getting our hands a hold of to try to save it,' said Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.  Meanwhile, AIG's CEO is expected on Capitol Hill to face tough questions from lawmakers and an angry nation.  CEO Edward Liddy is certain to face a grilling tomorrow, but legal experts say it will take more than tough talk to break AIG's contracts.
