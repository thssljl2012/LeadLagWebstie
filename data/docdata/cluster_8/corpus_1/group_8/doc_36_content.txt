(YAHOO) WASHINGTON -- Denouncing a 'squandering of the people's money,' lawmakers voted decisively Thursday to impose a 90 percent tax on millions of dollars in employee bonuses paid by troubled insurance giant AIG and other bailed-out companies.  In some cases the bonuses might be taxed 100 percent leaving the recipients with nothing.  It was only this past weekend that the bailed-out insurance giant paid bonuses totaling $165 million to employees, including traders in the Financial Products unit that nearly brought about AIG's collapse.
