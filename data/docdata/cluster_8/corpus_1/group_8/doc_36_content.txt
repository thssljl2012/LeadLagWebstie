Under the plan  agreed by a majority of 328 to 93  employees of bailed-out firms who receive incomes in excess of $250,000 (172,000) would be forced to hand back nine-tenths of any additional financial rewards.  It follows outrage over $165m (114m) worth of bonuses handed out to about 400 staff at struggling insurance giant AIG.  The insurer was rescued from collapse last year following a federal handout of $170bn (117bn).  Earlier this week, President Barack Obama described the payments as an outrage, adding that AIG's financial woes were the result of recklessness and greed.  The bonuses he referred to relate to payments promised to about 415 employees, most of whom worked at the firm's financial products division.  The loyalty rewards were agreed before AIG was forced to go cap in hand to the government. The government bailed out the insurer amid concerns that allowing its collapse could have far-reaching consequences and deeply worsen the global economic downturn.  As a result of its measures, the Government now owns 80% of the insurer.  Yesterday's House vote saw 243 Democrats and 85 Republicans vote for the tax. It affects staff at firms which have received more than $5bn (3.4bn) in rescue funds.  House speaker Nancy Pelosi said: We want our money back and we want our money back now for the taxpayers.  The large margin of the bill's victory came despite opposition from some Republicans that it was a ploy to paper over mistakes made by Obama's administration which allowed the bonuses in the first place.  The proposed legislation will now move on to the Senate.
