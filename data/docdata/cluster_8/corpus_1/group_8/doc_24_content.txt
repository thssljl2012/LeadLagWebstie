WASHINGTON - Denouncing a 'squandering of the people's money,' lawmakers voted decisively Thursday to impose a 90 percent tax on millions of dollars in employee bonuses paid by troubled insurance giant AIG and other bailed-out companies.  The House vote was 328-93. Similar legislation has been introduced in the Senate, and President Barack Obama quickly signaled general support for the concept.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, told colleagues: 'We want our money back now for the taxpayers. It isn't that complicated.' Republicans took Democrats to task for rushing to tax AIG bonuses worth an estimated $165 million after the majority party stripped from last month's economic stimulus bill a provision that could have banned such payouts. 'This political circus that's going on here today with this bill is not getting to the bottom of the questions of who knew what and when did they know it,' House Republican Leader John Boehner of West Chester said. He voted 'no,' but 85 fellow Republicans joined 243 Democrats in voting 'yes.' Opposed: six Democrats and 87 Republicans.  The bill would impose a 90 percent tax on bonuses given to employees with family incomes above $250,000 at American International Group and other companies that have received at least $5 billion in government bailout money. It would apply to any such bonuses issued since Dec. 31.
