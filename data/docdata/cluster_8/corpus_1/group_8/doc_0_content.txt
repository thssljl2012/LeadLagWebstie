WASHINGTON  The White House says the administration's latest loan to American International Group is critical as the insurer restructures. And, a spokesman isn't ruling out future aid for the insurance giant.  Spokesman Robert Gibbs says the Treasury Department determined that doing nothing was unacceptable. He said the potential failure of AIG was too big a risk to take, given the fragile economy.  The government is giving insurance giant AIG another $30 billion in loans. It's already pumped $150 billion into the company.  Asked by reporters whether this is the last infusion of cash for AIG, Gibbs said the administration hopes it's the last time it has to help AIG. But he also said Treasury Department is evaluating the health of banks, and he reiterated President Barack Obama's position that he will take steps to ensure there's not an economic catastrophe.
