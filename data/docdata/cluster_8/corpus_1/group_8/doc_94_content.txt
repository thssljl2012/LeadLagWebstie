I would like to take this opportunity to apologize for having to bring this bad news into your home each night. Trust me, I'd rather report on happier things. But alas, that is the downside of being a consumer reporter.  In the past month I've gone through an entire bottle of Advil. By the time you see me on on the 4PM news I usually have a migrane the size of Texas.  Most of my 12-hour work day is spent reading and listening to the bad stuff and trying to figure out how to explain it to our viewers so that it makes sense.  OK.....now I feel better.  But today my head nearly exploded when I heard this latest news!  It involves Bank of America, the same folks that our tax dollars helped bail out, and Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America gobbled up last year in a merger.  Bank of America says it doesn't want to disclose the names of Merrill Lynch employees who were paid year-end bonuses because they believe it would enable competitors to poach the banks top talent.  Those bonuses amounted to $3.6 billion! That is billion with a B.  Are they nuts? If these folks were the bank's top talent, and we had to bail them out, what do they qualify as being a bad employee over there? Sorry. I just had to vent.  This information came to light in documents that Bank of America filed today in state court in Manhattan. This involves a case brought by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to compel former Merrill Chief Executive Officer John Thain to testify about the bonus recipients.
