President Obama said his administration will pursue every legal avenue to block bonuses awarded by insurance giant AIG to its executives and traders. This is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed, Obama said Monday. Under these circumstances, its hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses, much less $165 million in extra pay. How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat? The U.S. government has provided $173 billion to AIG, which almost collapsed due to huge losses on credit default swaps -- insurance that other businesses bought to cover losses on mortgage-backed securities and other investments.  Since AIG has received substantial sums from the U.S. Treasury, Obama said, the government has leverage over it when it comes to bonuses.
