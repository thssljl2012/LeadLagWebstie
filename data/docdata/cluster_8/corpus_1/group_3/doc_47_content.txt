A Leeds man is urging customers to challenge bank charges as the High Court reconsiders whether they can be found to be unfair.Tony Batley, 28, of Old Farnley, succeeded in having 63 refunded to his account after he was billed for going 1.70 over an agreed overdraft with the Halifax bank.Today banks were due to unite to appeal a judicial ruling earlier this year that bank charges could be tested under fairness laws.The banks argue the charges are needed to cover administrative costs when handling rogue transactions.But Mr Batley said the charge he received was simply ridiculous and highlighted the desperation of high street banks.The Government plunged 35bn into Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB, Barclays and Halifax-Bank of Scotland (HBOS) earlier this month in the biggest rescue of Britain's high-street banks.Mr Batley said: 'Halifax are just trying to get money from customers, which is more important than ever right now because they are in financial trouble.'I miscalculated the status of my current account by a few pence.'It is ridiculous that I was ever charged. Other customers must fight their corner. If you lie back they are going to walk all over you.'A spokeswoman for HBOS said she was unable to comment on Mr Batley's case owing to data protection laws.The appeal by the banks is the latest chapter in a consumer-led campaign which seeks to see all 'unreasonable' charges  typically 25 to 35  refunded to customers.Historic claims dating back several years have been on hold since the test case began.
