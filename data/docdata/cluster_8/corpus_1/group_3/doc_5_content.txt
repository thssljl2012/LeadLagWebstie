  OAKLAND While the state's recently-approved $103.4 billion budget isn't likely to devastate Alameda County's coffers this year, the county's top administrative official warned Tuesday that next year's budgeting could be significantly more painful.In a short, unscheduled update on the county budget and how it may be affected by the 85-day-late state budget approved last week, County Administrator Susan Muranishi told county supervisors that while the county will lose some state money this year, next year is likely to be worse as Sacramento will have to deal with a more than $1 billion deficit.'The real pain will be next year,' Muranishi told the supervisors in the opening minutes of their regular weekly meeting.Muranishi said the county will lose $1.8 million in redevelopment funding from the state part of the $350 in redevelopment funding cuts approved in the state budget. Muranishi added that the state budget also included about $60 million in cuts to health and social-service programs, but that the county budget approved in June factored in some of those losses.Lastly, Muranishi said the likelihood of a statewide June special election would also increase the county's financial burden, costing the county about $3 million. The county is still reviewing the state budget to analyze its full effect locally, Muranishi said, as well as closely following any resolutions or add-ons passed after last week's budget approval.'We know the devil is in the details,' said Muranishi, adding that while the county budget is balanced, the situation is 'fragile and precarious.'Muranishi also addressed the current economic crisis and its effect on the county, saying the county has seen a rise in property-tax delinquency and more than 9,000 property owners have filed appeals this year with the county over their assessed property value more than twice the number from last year.However, Muranishi said, Wall Street's meltdown has not significantly affected the county's investment pool because of the county's conservative behavior in the market, saying the county had been prudent with where it puts its money.Some government agencies have been hurt because of heavy investments tied to companies such as AIG Insurance or others the federal government is looking to bail out.Reach Chris Metinko at 510-763-5418 or cmetinko@bayareanewsgroup.com.
