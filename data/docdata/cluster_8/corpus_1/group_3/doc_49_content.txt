Recently, we have seen a significant increase in deposits and in the last week alone, double the average numbers of term deposit accounts have been opened.'Lloyds TSB has just been voted the UK's safest bank (sixth in the world) by Global Finance magazine.The new accounts can be opened at any Lloyds TSB branch or by calling 0845 730 1400.
