A Victorian man who swindled more than $300,000 worth of goods from institutions including banks, should not receive a lenient sentence because he gambled, a judge says.Michael John Connally, 36, bought several mobile phones and plasma televisions, hired electrical goods and even rented homes using a complex web of fictitious names, a court heard.He opened bank accounts and obtained credit cards from institutions including GE Money, BankWest, ANZ Bank and St George using the false identities, the Victorian County Court was told.The multiple offences occurred between October 2003 and May 2007, including when Connally was on bail last year.Connally, a father-of-two, has pleaded guilty to 69 charges of obtaining and attempting to obtain financial advantage and property by deception.He also pleaded guilty to two counts of theft and one count of dishonestly obtaining an Australian passport.Connally's lawyer Simon Zebrowski told the pre-sentence hearing his client was a gambler who became heavily indebted to a Vietnamese man he met at Crown Casino, and committed the crimes to repay a $125,000 debt.But Judge Leslie Ross said this could not be considered a mitigating factor when sentencing. 'You choose your friends,' he said. 'From my point of view, it doesn't have one scrap of mitigatory significance.' Crown prosecutor Amanda Ring called for an immediate jail term.She said Connally was 'a very well-practised fraudster'. Judge Ross remanded Connally in custody until a sentencing date to be fixed.  2008 AAP Brought to you by
