New Vision (Kampala)A SENIOR Barclays Bank manager was yesterday charged with embezzling sh73m from the bank. David Tirwomwe was charged at Buganda Road Court and remanded in Luzira Prison. He denied the charge. 'This offence is not bailable by this court. If you intend to apply for bail you can apply in the High Court,' Magistrate Francis Kobusheshe advised Tirwomwe, who had no lawyer, before remanding him. Tirwomwe had been working as the Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) operation manager at Barclays Bank on Jinja Road. Prosecution alleges that between the month of June and September, Tirwomwe at the Barclays Bank's office transferred money from the suspense account to his private account. Before the scam was noticed, over sh73m had been lost through fraudulent transactions, said prosecutor Kate Basuuta. Tirwomwe was remanded to Luzira Prison until October 15, when the case will come up for mention. Tirwomwe, casually dressed, appeared visibly worried in the dock as the charge was read out to him.
