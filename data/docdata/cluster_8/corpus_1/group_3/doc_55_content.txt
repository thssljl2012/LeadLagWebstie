 New technology may reduce the number of cell phone related accidents. Studies have found drivers on cell phones are four times as likely to get into an accident. Now a company has developed Drive Assist, software that is downloaded to a phone. If GPS detects driving motion, a signal is sent to the wireless provider, which disables outgoing calls, except to 911, and diverts incoming calls to a custom voicemail. Drive Assist will be available sometime next year. It shoud cost between $10 and $20 a month. Nationwide Insurance has already announced people who use it will save money on their policies. Research shows whether or not drivers are actually holding the phone, they are just as distracted by the conversation itself and as impaired as if they were legally drunk.
