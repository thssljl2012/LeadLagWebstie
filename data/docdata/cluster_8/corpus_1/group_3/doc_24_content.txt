In trying to understand why a government fearing a budget black hole has rushed to throw money at a V8 car race on the site of the 'Green Games' Olympics, it is easy to overlook the role of lunch.Monday's announcement by the Premier, Nathan Rees, that his Government had ignored the recommendation of its special events committee, would legislate to create a V8 car race authority, and would spend $30 million on the race, infuriated councils and residents, drew heavy flak from conservative, green and Labor politicians and left political insiders and rival motor-racing groups marvelling at the persuasiveness of V8 Supercars.How had this private company convinced the Government to stump up big money on a car race now, just weeks away from a mini-budget widely expected to ditch big infrastructure projects and pare back spending on basic services?The V8 Supercars Australia chief, Tony Cochrane, went some way to answering this question when he gave thanks to those who helped deliver him the impossible.First to be feted was Rees, the Premier of barely three weeks, who had 'jumped on board' in 'difficult circumstances'. Real credit, though, went to the Minister for Primary Industries and State Development, Ian Macdonald, a 'tremendous supporter' along with the Treasurer, Eric Roozendaal. The media heavyweights John Hartigan from News Corporation and David Leckie from Channel Seven were applauded as great backers, as was Ken Edwards, who runs the stadium that hosted the Olympics. This week Edwards hosted the V8 announcement and is likely to host the concert promised as part of the V8 race weekends.But the most effusive thanks went to someone unknown to many listening to Cochrane. 'To Greg Jones - who I know is going to be really embarrassed by me even mentioning his name here today - Greg has been one of the most fantastic people behind the scenes.' Mark Skaife and other race drivers at the launch might not have known the Jones name, but Macdonald certainly did.The two men go back decades and grew close in the early 1980s when both were employed in the office of the left-wing Labor NSW attorney-general Frank Walker, where they forged reputations as players in the faction's hard left subgroup. In the 27 years since the Herald carried a front page story about the pair stacking ALP branches in the St George area with non-English-speaking Arabic migrants, the men have remained good friends, despite Macdonald remaining in politics while Jones went off to work as a promoter and make his fortune from the RAMS home loans float. They have long liked to lunch long. 'An Olympic luncher,' is how one acquaintance described Jones, who is the chairman of Macdonald's NSW Wine Industry Research and Development Advisory Council, an all-male group with a membership that reads like a who's who of the NSW wine industry.Sprinkled among the names of McWilliam, Tyrrell and DeBortoli are Hartigan and Edwards, members of the council, otherwise known as Macdonald's luncheon club. The group meets with the minister every three or six months, often at a classy restaurant such as Paddington's Buon Ricordo, or Mildura's Grand Hotel, in Victoria, where they flew a while back to dine at Stefano de Pieri's famous eatery and discuss how best to promote the state's wines.It was at occasions like these that the idea took root of converting Sydney Olympic Park into a giant street-car race circuit. Why not bring all the roar and excitement of a Bathurst 1000 or a Gold Coast Indy to Homebush Bay where the white elephant of Sydney's 2000 Games could be put to better use?Jones says he was only too happy to use his connections with Macdonald and his understanding of how decisions get made in the Government to help his V8 mate, Cochrane.'I know how government works because I have worked in government,' he said by phone from Port Douglas, where he is holidaying. 'I am just helping me old mate Tony and I knew all the people involved and then Ian was given the job of managing it by cabinet  It was just a group of people who fell into place.'He scoffed at critics and predicted the Government would win praise for delivering a great sporting spectacular to the western suburbs, an event he said would be a perfect fit with News Ltd readers. 'I don't know what all the fuss is about,' Jones said.The fuss, of course, is largely about money - how much will the race really cost taxpayers and what will taxpayers get in return? As news of the race firmed less than a fortnight ago, Macdonald told Parliament the Government's contribution would be capped 'in the order of $25 million over five years'.Five days later, Macdonald and Rees said the cost to the Government of converting Olympic Park into a 3.4-kilometre circuit and holding five annual races - the first in December next year - would be between $28 million and $30 million, and 'it is capped'.Responding to the Herald this week, Macdonald made it clear that while there will be a cap, there is not one yet. The deal has not been finalised, so no one can say what it will cost. 'The figure the Government enters into with the proponent will be capped,' said Macdonald. It was too early to say who would pay for expenses such as insurance, extra public transport for the races, security, tree removal and restoration. 'The terms of the deed are yet to be finalised,' the minister said.It now appears the $30 million estimated as the total cost does not include compensation the Government might have to pay businesses whose operations would be disrupted by the race.The predicted economic benefits are as hazy as forecasts of costs. Rees said the races would add more than $100 million to the state's economy, attract at least 70,000 people on race day, including 15,000 from overseas and interstate, and create the equivalent of more than 110 full-time jobs.He could not release the economic modelling forecasting these benefits until he checked whether the document was bound by cabinet confidentiality. The Premier's office confirmed later that the modelling report had not gone to cabinet but would still not be released because it was now classified 'commercial in confidence'.Assessing what money V8 Supercars might contribute is just as difficult. Cochrane was suitably vague and said his company plans to contribute 'in the vicinity of $10 million to $11.5 million a year'.The last time a NSW government spent up big on motorsport was in the late 1980s when the Greiner administration said it was risking just $2 million of public funds to secure a motorbike race for Eastern Creek; it ended up spending what Bob Carr's Labor government later calculated at $134 million. That experience demonstrated how expensive big events can be; plenty of critics are sceptical about the total costs for the V8 races.The Australian Racing Drivers Club, which operates Eastern Creek raceway, predicts the total State Government subsidy could be as high as $90 million over five years, money it says will be wasted. 'For that amount of money, Eastern Creek could become the best permanent circuit in Australia by far, hosting all levels of races except formula one,' said the club president, John Cotter.The Eastern Creek proposal is backed by motor racing greats, including the Australian Touring Car champions Allan Moffat, Bob Jane, Colin Bond, John Bowe and Glenn Seton, and Bathurst 1000 winners John French, John Harvey, Barry Seton and Bob Holden. All signed a petition to the NSW Government calling for Eastern Creek enhancement.After V8 Supercars pitched their Homebush Bay proposal, the precinct's administrator, the Sydney Olympic Park Authority, commissioned a report on costs. It concluded that the races' true cost was millions of dollars higher than the company's estimates. Even when taking into account different circuit designs, 'it is clear that in all scenarios the current V8 Supercars Australia budget estimates are too low and/or incomplete', the authority was told.For V8 Supercars' indomitable chairman, Cochrane, this week's announcement of a go-ahead was a triumph after years chasing government backing for a Homebush Bay street race.The Olympic Park authority board, chaired by Michael Knight, the former Olympics minister and a one-time factional ally of Jones and Macdonald, has lobbied hard against car racing in a precinct it has promoted as green and sustainable.Opposition to the races on economic grounds is coming from the Premier's adviser on events, John O'Neill, and the government's infrastructure chief, David Richmond, who had a large role building the Olympic precinct and devising strategies for its long-term use, and who now is reportedly planning to leave the Government's service.Cochrane dismisses the criticism and what he describes as conspiracy theories about the Government being lent on by media heavies such as Hartigan and Leckie to run the race. He declined to be interviewed by the Herald this week but told this newspaper several months ago that Hartigan supported the race because he 'knows that V8 supercars sell papers'.'Our first submission [to the Government] went in about four years ago,' Cochrane said in July. 'That was rejected about 18 months, two years ago, and we were given a list of reasons why; and then we modified [proposals rejected by Government] and  put a new submission in around 15 months ago.'John Hartigan is a supporter, he's a terrific fan of the sport  and David Leckie,' said Cochrane. 'The head of Ticketek, Geoff Jones, is a supporter  It would be a sad day in Australia if CEOs couldn't be a fan of sports.'Less enthusiastic are some of the big commercial tenants at Olympic Park, such as the Commonwealth Bank and the property giant GPT Group. They never expected the tumult from a race that would take six weeks to set up and four weeks to dismantle; the congestion that would come with semi-trailer deliveries and departures for the hundreds of loads of barriers and grandstands and other structures trucked in.
