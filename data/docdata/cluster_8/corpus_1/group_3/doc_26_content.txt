A WOMAN was left outraged when a banks financial planner handed her a business card containing another persons private details.Jackie McKenzie went to the Bracknell High Street branch of Barclays Bank on Monday, September 29, to collect a form but was told she needed to see a financial planner before she could get it.Unfortunately he was busy so a colleague handed Mrs McKenzie his business card so she could contact him later. It was only when she got home that she saw some writing on the back.Mrs McKenzie, from Wokingham, said: I couldnt believe it, his business card had someone elses name, address, account number and sort code handwritten on the back of the card.I thought thats a bit odd, you shouldnt be giving out peoples details like this.Mrs McKenzie rang the financial planner, Clive Nunne, to tell him about the security lapse and he offered to collect the card from her home the next day but never showed up.More than a week afterwards there had been no further contact from the bank and so she finally called the branch manager to report the dreadful lack of security over peoples personal details.She said: He was supposed to come on Tuesday, but he didnt. I waited more than a week and he still hadnt turned up or arranged to get me my form so I called the manager to complain, and she was very apologetic.I gave them a chance to redeem themselves but they didnt. I just goes to show how they deal with people, they simply dont care about their customers.Barclays spokesman Danny Reardon said: We have strict systems in place to ensure all customer information is secure but it appears that on this occasion the procedures were not followed.We have arranged to collect the business card from the customer and put in place additional measures to make sure this does not happen again.
