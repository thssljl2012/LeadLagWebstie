A CUSTOMER is suing a bank after copies of personal documents were lost in the post.Christopher Burton, from Miles Platting, is claiming breaches of the data protection act, duty of care and negligence after copies of his passport and a utilities bill disappeared when he applied to open an account with the bank's city centre Market Street branch.Barclays have admitted that the documents were 'misplaced' in the post after the Manchester branch sent them on to another of their offices. But officials deny the specific accusations.Mr Burton's claim follows a similar blunder earlier this month when Jeanette Foster, who applied to open an account at the bank's Moston Lane branch, was sent copies of another customer's driving licence and account details while her own were lost in the post.Barclays described that mix up as an 'isolated incident'.Mr Burton, 37, said he is livid that his documents were lost in a climate where identity theft is rife.He said: 'They are putting me at serious risk - I may not know for months or years who has their hands on my information and whether someone is stealing my identity.'Barclays say they have followed their standard practice but if that is the case it needs reviewing.'It is now becoming clear that incidents like this are not isolated and each one begs the question how many more customers are being put at risk?'Mr Burton visited the branch in July with a view to opening an account and photocopies of his identification documents were taken.He was told he would receive correspondence from the bank within ten days.When he had not heard from them after two weeks he returned to the branch where a staff member looked into the matter and admitted that his documents had not reached their destination.He added: 'They recommended that I resubmit the application but I was hardly going to let them lose my details all over again.'A spokesman for Barclays said: 'As this matter is proceeding through the courts, it would not be appropriate to comment.'
