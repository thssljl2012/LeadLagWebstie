EVEN the most ardent opponents of the death penalty must feel a twitch in their trigger fingers when Bali bombers Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra launch into their Allah warrior act.The three goons were at it again yesterday, bragging and cackling like Satan's monkeys throughout a post-Ramadan celebration at their prison.Of all their obscene comments, Samudra's line about regretting only the deaths of Muslims in the trio's bomb attacks seems most worthy of note.The self-described holy warriors killed dozens of their faith in 2002, and ruined the lives and livelihoods of many more.Now, holy wars - among the oldest types of human conflict - are fairly basic affairs. They usually involve killing people who don't share your faith. These morons couldn't even get that right.As any of the families of those Muslims killed by these three lunatics could tell you, their war is anything but holy.In fact, it is a war against civilisation, waged by forces tied to the Dark Ages.That era ended long, long ago. Thankfully, these three throwbacks will soon be sent to join it.Swan too softWHILE the US deliberates on a $700 billion bailout of its major banks - a figure that is hard to comprehend - politicians here are struggling with how to phrase their warnings to banks that they must take their share of the pain of the current financial crisis.Opposition Leader and former banker Malcolm Turnbull has quite colourfully turned his back on his former colleagues, demanding major lenders respond to next week's likely cut in rates by the Reserve Bank of Australia.The Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and his deputy Julia Gillard have, as well, stepped up their rhetoric on the issue.But Treasurer Wayne Swan, who more than anyone occupies the economic hotseat, is in grave danger of becoming an observer of the growing confusion, rather than someone willing to take a stand.Yesterday he upgraded his message to the banks to 'strongly encourage' them to abide by the RBA.But homeowners sweating out the current crisis need more - Mr Swan's strong encouragement must be replaced with strong leadership. Premier tipTHE Manly bandwagon continues to gain momentum. Even Premier Nathan Rees, a proud Westie and Parramatta fan, has hopped aboard.He joins a colourful cast of characters, including chief Fibro Tommy Raudonkis, now cheering for the once hated team north of the Harbour.We wish them the best of luck on Sunday. Go Manly!  What is this?
