Anti-spam company ClearMyMail says it has seen a 246% surge in spam and phishing e-mails about the groups and Lloyds TSB, which is acquiring the Halifax Bank of Scotland Group, over the weekend. The group said fraudsters are trying to trick worried and vulnerable accountholders into revealing their account information and passwords. It warned people to automatically delete any e-mails which have titles like 'Important message from Halifax Bank', or similar ones relating to Lloyds TSB and Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley. Under a phishing scam, fraudsters send e-mails to people pretending to be from their bank to try to get them to disclose their account details and passwords on a bogus website. Dan Field, managing director of ClearMyMail, said: 'This is a particularly cruel batch of phishing e-mails that are looking to target worried and vulnerable UK banking customers. 'It is not just our UK customers who are being targeted, as our American clients also had an increase in Lehman Brothers fraudulent e-mails over the past week, but not at the same scale as here in the UK.' The group said the majority of the e-mails are being tracked to senders in the United States and Canada, but it added that fraudsters are using increasingly sophisticated technology to cover their tracks. The warning came as payments group APACS said it had seen a 185% jump in online banking fraud losses to 21.4m, largely driven by phishing attacks and spyware scams. Fraudulent e-mails about Yorkshire-based Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley and Halifax have more than tripled as criminals try to cash in on customers' anxiety, figures show.
