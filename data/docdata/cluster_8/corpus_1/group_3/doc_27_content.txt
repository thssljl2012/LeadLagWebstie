Three appeal judges were urged to overrule a High Court decision in April that the fees charged to personal current account customers were subject to regulation by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) under 'unfair contract' rules.At the start of a Court of Appeal hearing set for six days, the banks' lawyers argued the charges were exempt from the 1999 Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations because they were legitimate 'remuneration for goods and services supplied' to customers in the form of overdraft facilities.The High Court judgment by Mr Justice Andrew Smith opened the way for an OFT investigation into whether the charges are actually unfair, and if so, what a fair charge should be.The banks also argue the charges are not unfair because they represent legitimate fees for providing overdraft facilities.The test case was brought jointly by the Office of Fair Trading and seven banks and a building society after consumers began to reclaim millions of pounds of charges through the courts.Fees for people who go into unauthorised overdraft or who breach their agreed limit can be as much as 35 for a single bounced payment, although campaigners claim the cost to the banks could be as little as 2.50.If it is upheld, the judgment could cost banks 2.6 billion a year in lost revenue and lead to them having to make refunds of up to 1 billion at a time.The decision by the banks to appeal the ruling has been criticised by consumer groups, as thousands of bank customers hoping to recover the charges must wait until the outcome of the test case is known before they can apply for a refund.City watchdog the Financial Services Authority has granted a stay on outstanding claims until January 26 next year, and it is expected to continue extending it until the end of the case.The banks involved in the test case are Abbey, Barclays, Clydesdale, Halifax Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland Group and Nationwide Building Society. MAJOR high street banks today renewed their court bid to avoid an official inquiry into the fairness of the charges they levy for unauthorised overdrafts.
