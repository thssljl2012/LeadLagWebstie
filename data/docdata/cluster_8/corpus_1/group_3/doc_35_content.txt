Data in this poll is provided by those who know the candidates best: those attorneys who practice before them or who have professional contact with them, said CBA President Phillip Schworer. We hope this information is helpful to residents of Hamilton County as they head to the polls on Election Day. Full survey results can be found here. Although 17 judges were rated, only six are involved in election races where they face opposition. Heres how candidates fared in those races:Democrat Norma Davis received a higher percentage of positive ratings than her opponent, Hamilton County Commissioner Pat DeWine. On the issue of integrity, character and objectivity, for example, 56 percent of the 39 attorneys who offered an opinion on Davis rated her as excellent, compared to 26 percent (out of 89 surveys) for DeWine. The Republican commissioner received some of the highest negative ratings of all of those in the survey, with 39 percent rating DeWine as poor in the integrity issue and 34 percent giving him low marks for legal experience. Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Fred Nelson, who is running against Democrat Jerry Metz, received the third-highest number of excellent ratings, with 166 local attorneys giving Nelson their highest rating for integrity. Nelson ranked second behind Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Beth Myers in the number of attorneys who gave him an excellent rating on legal experience and knowledge. On a percentage basis, Metzs scores were comparable, though slightly below Nelsons. In a third contested judicial race, Democrat Jody Luebbers drew higher ratings than her Republican opponent Russell Mock. Luebbers received excellent ratings from 75 percent of the 163 attorneys who returned surveys, compared to 44 percent for Mock. In the category of legal experience, 64 percent gave Luebbers an excellent rating, compared to Mocks 36 percent.
