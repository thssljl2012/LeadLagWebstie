The Wall Street executives who tried to explain themselves to Congress last week showed a galling lack of personal accountability and major chutzpah.One by one, disgraced CEOs ... pointed the blame for their firms' downfalls everywhere but where it belongs  on themselves. The greed and recklessness of these 'titans' brought on the financial meltdown.In at least some of Wall Street's risky investment schemes, it appears fraud was involved. A congressional panel found executives at insurance giant AIG hid some of its more risky financial products from auditors as the firm's losses mounted. One AIG auditor quit after he was blocked from asking how the company estimated its liabilities.The potential fraud at the core of the mortgage crisis highlights the need for a comprehensive federal task force to investigate these matters.A task force could help to streamline a multitude of criminal probes already under way, and prevent overlapping jurisdictions.... this crisis is causing deeper financial pain for a broader swath of citizens than the accounting scandals did. The Justice Department needs to find out whether criminal laws were broken in Wall Street's zeal to land eight-figure bonuses.
