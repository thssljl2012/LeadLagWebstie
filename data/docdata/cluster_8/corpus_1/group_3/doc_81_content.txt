The South Boston News &amp;amp; Record published a piece by a reader titled, My bailout plan. The readers idea was to take the $85 billion given to insurance giant AIG in a recent bailout and spread it around to every adult American instead. The reader gets into trouble with the math, however (ok, and the grammar):So divide 200 million adults 18+ into $85 billion that equals $425,000. My plan is to give $425,000 to every person as a We Deserve It Dividend.Dont spend the money yet. $85 billion divided by 200 million Americans comes to $425, not $425,000. It would cost $85 trillion to give every American $425,000. The total current national debt is about $10 trillion.Oops.Oh, and it turns out that the local reader the piece is attributed to didnt even come up with the idea: Its been circulating as an e-mail on the Internet since September and was originally attributed to T.J. Birkenmeier, A Creative Guy and Citizen of the Republic.
