This newspaper noted on Monday that departing David Thompson Health Region CEO John Vogelzang will get a golden handshake equivalent to two years of salary and benefits.The Red Deer Advocate has previously reported his salary to be about $402,000 per year and we can only assume rather generous benefits accompany such a large salary.So the total package is worth at least $804,000 and maybe as much as $1 million or more.The exact amount of the award has not been made public yet, although Vogelzang says it will be at the end of the fiscal year.It goes without saying that taxpayers have a right to that information since we will be paying the bill.Is the former big cheese of health care in Red Deer and region wrong to accept such a severance package?No, he's not.Obviously, he struck himself a good contract when he took on his considerable responsibilities at the DTHR and the health region is legally and morally bound to live up to it, especially since Vogelzang lost his job because of the province's decision to restructure health care.If the rest of us could get such a generous payout, we'd no doubt take it, too.As well, Vogelzang appears to have done an excellent job.Still, there is one question that needs to be asked: Are such large severance packages justified, especially when they come from the public purse?It's one thing for a private firm to throw money around like it grows on trees, but should that happen in the public sector?In a word: no.What has outraged many Albertans is that severance packages similar to the one Vogelzang is getting have been awarded in many health regions.In fact, some people are getting more money than Vogelzang.For instance, Calgary Health Region CEO Jack Davis got a $4-million pension top-up when he was terminated.Wouldn't it be nice if that money could have been used to help staff an operating room or provide a few more badly needed hospital beds? But no, that would make too much sense.As our MLAs have told us again and again, especially when they've raised their own wages, you can't get good people unless you pay top dollar.Yet look at the quality of some of our MLAs. Are they truly the best people to be found for the job?Sure, they've legitimately won their jobs by being elected, but there's no truth in the suggestion that capable personnel can only be secured if salaries are hiked to the sky.Salaries need to be attractive, no question, but do we need to turn health administrators into millionaires? No, we don't, and arguably we do society a disservice when we do.When you pay a manager so much money, you take him or her further away from the average person by granting the boss an exalted status. That's OK if you're dealing with the manager of a National Football League team, but if it's an organization owned by the taxpayer, such as a health region, then it's a mistake.Would CEOs of Alberta's various health regions have taken their jobs if their compensation had been only half as generous? In some cases, probably not.But would there have been someone competent willing to do the job for less? You bet.Hiking the wages of the CEO of a large organization to an obscene level simply because it has a large annual budget and many employees and/or customers is short-sighted.It's got to the point where even in the private sector, at the top of the totem pole, the pay often no longer corresponds with performance.For instance, in the United States, Martin Sullivan, the chief executive of insurance giant AIG, is leaving with a US$47-million severance package for running the company into the ground.Similar payouts are expected to happen at such recent financial failures as Merrill Lynch, Lehman Bros., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Last year in the United States, President George W. Bush and pals said it would cost too much to provide universal health care for children (about US$6 billion annually).However, apparently it may be possible to find hundreds of billions of dollars to bail out Wall Street this year.Does anyone else see anything wrong with this picture?There's enough money to go around in our society, but it's going into too few hands.No wonder we have homelessness and hunger even in a community as prosperous as Red Deer.And no wonder we don't have enough staff for operating rooms or enough hospital beds for sick people.Lee Giles is an Advocate editor.
