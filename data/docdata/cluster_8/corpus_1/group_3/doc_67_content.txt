 The Rudd government has made a second attempt in two days to force Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull to front parliament and apologise for attacks on two of the nation's most senior finance officials.  The government wants Mr Turnbull to immediately condemn and retract attacks by opposition MPs on the Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens and Treasury Secretary Ken Henry.It also wants Mr Turnbull to apologise for reckless and irresponsible attacks on Dr Henry, the government says the opposition leader made during question time on Tuesday.The opposition failed in an attempt to gag government Leader of the House Anthony Albanese.The government says Mr Turnbull needs to apologise for comments made by Liberal MP Don Randall who accused Mr Stevens of being caught out on interest rates.He put up the interest rates before the election, during the election when the rest of the world were bringing down interest rates, Mr Randall told reporters earlier today.And now in a way to cover the governments inept behaviour, they (the banks) are bringing down interest rates at probably the most rapid rate Australia has ever seen.It really is chaotic, shambolic.The government also wants Mr Turnbull to apologise for comments made by Liberal senator Eric Abetz directed at Dr Henry during a Senate estimates hearing yesterday.In the last three days we have seen three unprecedented attacks from the Liberal Party of Australia, Government Leader of the House Anthony Albanese told parliament.An opposition move to have the government's motion ruled out of order was rejected by acting deputy speaker Dick Adams, leading to a dissent motion from the coalition.Liberal frontbencher Christopher Pyne said the opposition was disappointed, shocked and surprised at Mr Adams ruling.This motion is unprecedented, it is uncalled for and it is out of order, he said.It is out of order because it is unparliamentary. It is a potential breach of privilege.It was utterly unprecedented in the history of federation for a motion to be moved demanding an action by any member.(Mr Albanese) has come in and moved a frivolous motion, a foolish motion, a trivial motion (and has) reduced the house to a side-show, a rag-time show.Frontbench colleague Tony Abbott said the motion was a fundamental affront to members of parliament.This motion (moved by Mr Albanese) puts words in the mouth of a member of this parliament, he said.Mr Albanese said the last three days had seen unprecedented opposition attacks on the integrity of Australia's financial regulators who had served the previous Howard government well.This was political cannibalism of the worst kind, Mr Albanese said.Confidence in Australia's regulators was essential at a time of global financial crisis.All the government was seeking was for Mr Turnbull to express confidence in Dr Henry and Mr Stevens.The dissent motion was defeated on party lines and the governments motion calling on Mr Turnbull to apologise was carried 76-56.
