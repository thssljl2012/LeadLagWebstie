A CUSTOMER is suing Barclays after copies of his personal documents were lost in the post. A copy of Christopher Burton's passport, a utilities bill and his completed account application form went missing when the bank's Market Street branch, in Manchester, sent them to another office. Now the 37-year-old from Miles Platting is taking the bank to court claiming breaches of the Data Protection Act and duty of care and negligence. Barclays contest his claim but have admitted documents were 'misplaced' in the post. Mr Burton's claim follows a similar blunder reported in the M.E.N. this month when Jeanette Foster, who applied to open an account at the bank's Moston Lane branch, was sent copies of another customer's driving licence and account details while her own were lost in the post. Barclays described that mix up as an 'isolated incident'. Mr Burton said: 'They are putting me at serious risk - I may not know for months or years who has their hands on my information and whether someone is stealing my identity. 'Barclays say they have followed their standard practice but if that is the case it needs reviewing. 'It is now becoming clear that incidents like this are not isolated and each one begs the question how many more customers are being put at risk?' Mr Burton visited the branch in July to open an account and photocopies of his documents were taken. He went back after he hadn't heard from the bank for two weeks - a staff member looked into the matter and admitted that his documents had not reached their destination. Mr Burton said: 'They recommended that I resubmit the application but I was hardly going to let them lose my details all over again.' A spokesman for Barclays said: 'As this matter is proceeding through the courts, it would not be appropriate to comment.'
