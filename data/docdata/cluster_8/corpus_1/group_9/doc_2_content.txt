Several hundred demonstrators protested near Wall Street on Friday against the handling of the US economic crisis, government bailouts of private banks and corporations and bonuses paid out at insurer AIG. Members of worker rights, healthcare and anti-war groups gathered in the rain holding posters that read 'Bail Out the Unemployed' and 'No More $ For Wall St &amp; War.'  They also shouted demands for more jobs.  Hundreds of protesters lined up on Broadway to march past the headquarters of American International Group and close to the New York Stock Exchange and financial giants Bank of America, Chase and American Express, but were not permitted on Wall Street.  The rally was held as the rate of unemployment in the United States soared to 8.5 percent, the highest in 25 years, after employers cut 663,000 jobs in March.
