Bob, that would have accelerated all of the bubbles bursting at once, how would that have been "better"?     Isn't it best to put water on the house next to the one which is completely burning down? Why let the whole neighborhood or community burn down, why accelerate it by throwing gasoline everywhere?     That's what allowing Bear Stearns, Lehman Bros, AIG, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Merrill Lynch, Citibank, Wachovia, Washington Mutual...your assorted Countrywides, Indymack and some 50 other banks that have failed since 2008, GM, and Chrysler would have been like letting the whole town burn down at once.        --    Smoke Gets In Your Eyes     http://tinyurl.com/d49l9l
