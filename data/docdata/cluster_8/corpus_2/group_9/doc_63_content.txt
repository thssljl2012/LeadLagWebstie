Yeah, this is not good.  It's unclear what really happened here, but neither option is good.  Either Ken Lewis decided to keep material information out of shareholder hands, or the gov't caused a lot of people to lose a lot of money holding BoA stock because they withheld crucial information.  Neither scenario is good, and both could lead to major lawsuits.  The stock went from $30 to $3 (it's back to $9 now) during that period - so that's 90% losses there that were partially caused by this.
