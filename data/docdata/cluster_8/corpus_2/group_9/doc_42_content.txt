 What the hell are you talking about???? The only thing that matters is what the FED &amp; the Treasury determine they want to do. Read below thats what counts not some paid pundant or crazy scarred short who has been caught with his or her pants down. In that condition they will say any thing     How bad was Bank of America, really? You know what? It doesn't matter. Here's why. If Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, says Bank of America has enough capital, then what's the point of betting against it? Why would you sell it? I think the most important thing you need to know about Bank of America is that this game is not about not liking a CEO. I get the sense that many, many people simply hate BAC because they think that Ken Lewis has made too many mistakes. But what they don't realize is that if housing bottoms when I think it will, which is in the summer, you can't get enough BAC, provided that the Treasury doesn't interrupt the process. If you own a bank stock, you have to be prepared for any number of negative articles         Remember don't Fight the Fed &amp; the TREASURY         Back the Truck up &amp; LOAD it up* Remember it takes a year for Long term Capital GAINS.
