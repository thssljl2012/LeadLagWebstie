        I just answered that question and provided a link to it....           Nope. You provided a link to an article that in no way supports your allegations. There is no mention of 12.8 trillion dollars sent to overseas bankers. You added that. Or the Federal Reserve transferring 12.8 trillion to overseas bankers. You added that. There's no mention of theft. You added that.     And its those baseless additions for which you have no evidence that are in contention. You are being questioned on your assumptions. As a truther, I would have assumed that advocating questions. Encouraged them.     Was I mistaken?              When they take money from the US taxpayers (against our will) to pay for their fraudulent credit default swap scams which they packaged and sold to overseas   banks....it's THEFT!           How so? If the US decides to bail out a company.....then all the company's contracts become void? The company is absolved of its contractual obligations?     According to who?              AIG was bailed out by the Federal Government using our tax dollars, and future tax dollars....Get a clue.               Yup. A government bailout. My question is...how is that theft? If AIG paid out on a homeowner's insurance policy after the bail out....was that homeowner 'stealing' from the American people? Are all of AIG's clients now 'thieves' for contracting with AIG?     If not, why not? For your reasoning to be valid, it has to be able to be consistently applied. And yours can't be.              f course not, dumbshit....The chart at Bloomberg breaks down where that 12.8 figure comes from...Not all of it went to AIG.             The Bloomberg breakdown articulates almost *no* transfers to foreign banks. How then is this evidence of 12.8 trillion dollars of 'theft' by foreign banks?     By all means, explain it to us.
