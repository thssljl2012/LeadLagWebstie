Come on man it's a pinksheet company, I'm a big boy, I bought this stock a few days ago higher and you don't hear me talking the way you do. I understand the risks with owning a pink sheet company. I own it for the momentum to move higher, not for the financials of a 3 year old company. If you are looking for Citi Bank or Bank of America, buy those companies. I hate when people don't take responsibility for their actions (investments). I mean really, your complaining about a 3 rear old CEO and Company, at the age at what he is for being a rookie...... Whats next getting mad at an old man for being old.....lol
