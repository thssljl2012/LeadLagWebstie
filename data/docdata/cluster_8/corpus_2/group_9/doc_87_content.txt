     Quote:                  Isn't mortgage insurance, required by all lenders if the down payment isn't high enough, the insurance of loaned money? That has been around for 50 years.             This is not what I am talking about.  I'm talking about a third party (AIG) selling insurance on loaned money tot he original lender which allows that lender to offer inflated loans and accept risky clients.  And it makes the loans easy to sell off.  Thus the lender again has little risk.    Mortgage Insurance as you state is some the borrower has to buy.    The risk remains in the collateral with that insurance where it should.      The former notion I talk of creates a false market.  Nothing exists except the passing of paper and money.   In the end who is left holding the hot potato goes down and that happened to be AIG.    If you look in history, many of the economic crises were caused by some sort of speculation and overvalue of a false market.  it happened in the 1880s, the 1920 and again recently in two sectors:  housing loans and oil.
