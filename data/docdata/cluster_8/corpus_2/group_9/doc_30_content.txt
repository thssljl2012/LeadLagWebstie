 FIDC is broke. And has announced this some months ago.     *******FDIC broke, asking for unlimited Treasury loans                Posted on October 1st, 2008 *********        http://blogofbile.com/2008/10/01/fdic-broke-asking-for-...  / and   FDIC warns US bank deposit insurance fund could tank..Mar. 5  http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090305/bs_afp/financeecon...    There are un-substantiated rumors the FDIC money has been spent by the Treasury on things Bush knew Congress would not approve of....like wars.  but a bigger problem remains. Congress, says the Constitution ( that "quaint" document )  has the sole authority to authorize expenditures and appropriate money..and debt. First Paulson and Bernanke, and now Geithner ( Paulson light) and Bernanke are pushing to give the Federal Reserve the power, removing what is left of oversight of spending from Congress. And Treasury Dept with happily print all the money the Fed wants, as it has been doing for some time.   THAT is the sneaky dirty secret going on here.
