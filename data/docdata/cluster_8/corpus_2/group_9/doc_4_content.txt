 Anger is building. Details have now become known    about the full extent of the bonus-paying spree to members    of the very team that brought the insurance giant AIG close to collapse.    The government propped up AIG with close to $200 billion    and now owns 80% of the company . The argument that $165 million    in bonuses had to be paid under contractual obligations    went down particularly hard with workers of the three U.S. car companies whose leaders appealed for support from  the Bush administration     last year  when the economic crisis began .        While CEOs made 45 times as much as workers in 1973 they make more than 300 times as much today, according to Holly Sklar,    author of Raise the Floor, Wages and Policies that Work for All of US.      These are  the inequalities  Obama promises to address.         INFORMATION BUREAU     The Great Debate  Debate Archive  In American crisis, anger and guns   The Great Debate
