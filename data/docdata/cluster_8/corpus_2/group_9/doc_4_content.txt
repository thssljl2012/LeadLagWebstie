   Geithner Cannot Describe AIG Exit Strategy     UPDATED at 11:32 A.M.:            Treasury Secretary  Tim Geithner  could not give an answer to this question, posed moments ago by Rep.  Jeb Hensarling  AIG ?" (R-Tex  .): "What is the exit strategy from AIG?"         Geithner is testifying before a congressional oversight committee headed by  Elizabeth Warren , the overseer of the bailout, underway right now.         Hensarling pointed out that AIG, the troubled insurance giant, has thus far received four infusions or promises of government money totaling about $180 billion "of taxpayer liability exposure and counting," Hensarling said.       Effectively, the government owns 80 percent of AIG.         Geithner was unable to spell out how the government -- and the taxpayer -- will be able to untangle from AIG because the government lacks the necessary tools, he said.         "We came into this crisis without a legal framework to manage the risks posed by AIG -- it was the tragic failure of this country," Geithner said. "We still do not have that authority today."    "Not as majority shareholders in AIG?" Hensarling interrupted.         "No. We do not have the ability or tools that were designed in the wake of the crises of the past decades given to the  FDIC ," Geithner said. "We would like to work with Congress to legislate authority over the coming weeks and months" to get that authority, he said.         Fed Chairman  Ben Bernanke  has echoed Geithner's point and has asked Congress for the authority to "wind down" troubled institutions such as AIG.               Gosh!    So now the taxpayers own 80% of a      bankrupt insurance company.  Sweet!
