 The recovery is still 12 to 18 months away, and, I believe, there is corporate conspiracy to keep the recovery at bay. Those who think they can survive this depression are sand bagging so as to force the low hanging fruit to drop off and wither into the soil. The survivors will flourish with renewed vigor and less competition. Imagine for a moment, B of A,with all its "toxic assets"buys up Countrywide and its "toxic assets", then takes federal bailout money, then takes insurance claims pay outs from AIG, then writes down its capital losses on its federal tax return, still maintaining "toxic assets" in its inventory. When the economy recovers, those toxic assets are now appreciable properties that provide a handsome return on their investment. That isn't a mistake, its a conspiracy, and the U. S. Congress is a co conspirator cause they continue to take corporate campaign contributions to delay regulatory safeguards and keep the conspiracy alive.
