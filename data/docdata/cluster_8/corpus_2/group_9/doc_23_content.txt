More importantly, for the long term, making sure that we've got a set of, er, er, regulations that are up to the task, er, and that includes, er, a number that will be discussed at this summit. I think there's a lot of convergence between all the parties involved about the need, for example, to focus not on the legal form that a particular financial product takes or the institution it emerges from, but rather what's the risk involved, what's the function of this product and how do we regulate that adequately, much more effective coordination, er, between countries so we can, er, anticipate the risks that are involved there   ~UM      I read it VERY carefully.     Although Obama rambled a bit and wasn't as concise as he could have been this is basically what he said    "We need to get back to the basics of bank regulation, in particular mortgage financing.  We also need to regulate other financial institutions such as insurance companies (AIG) to make sure that they don't create new financial products (credit default swaps) that fly under the radar of regulators and if they were to fail would put the entire financial industry in crisis."    I got it...not sure why you didn't.
