This is an idea that according to the article, started with Bush's idiots, but also included Obama's.    Ken Lewis, the head of Bank of America, which has received billions in taxpayer funds, told board members in a  Dec. 22 meeting  -- eight days before the transaction was to close -- that Fed and Treasury officials had informed him the board of directors and management of the bank he had presided over for years would be removed, according to minutes of the board meeting.    Obama has been elected by then.    Lewis told the board that Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke had said he had spoken with various other federal regulators,  including incoming Treasury officials of the Obama administration,  and that all parties had pledged their commitment to provide additional government funds to help Bank of America absorb losses on certain Merrill Lynch assets.    Obama was aware and involved with this to a degree. Most of the blame for this goes to Bush, but some does go to Obama for going along with the stupid plan. He could have said he would allow the company to make its own choice and I bet the board would have held out for the month until he was in office.
