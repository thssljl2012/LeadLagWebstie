         Wait.  One more headscratcher because I hadn't even heard of this.      Quote:    Secretly forced Bank of America to buy Merrill Lynch, then allowed the bank to be criticized for overpaying.         Huh?  BOA announced the ML purchase in September of last year, and it was Paulson and Bernanke who told him to keep quiet about losses.  This one doesn't even make any sense unless someone knows something about Presidential power that I don't.
