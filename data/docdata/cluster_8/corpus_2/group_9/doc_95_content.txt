Hey, I'm not for government intervention and bail outs, but the reality is that our country's most prominent banks have been allowed to grow to be so large that there permitted failure would cause a more complete seizure of  US credit markets and then the overall economy. Paulson's work in strong-arming BofA in taking on Merrill is completely justified given that the country is propping up BofA. When BofA came to the federal government with its hands cupped  asking for $20bill, it is justified that they should be willing to take a hit by swallowing Merrill, despite further deterioration, if it will keep things stable. The bankers had their chance at deregulation but they f-ed it up. Let BofA spin off Merell after things return to stability.
