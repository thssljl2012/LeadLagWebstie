 A few people are confusing a "finance" degree with banking and investments.        A degree, whatever it is, just opens doors to your first job.  Finance may or may not lead to a career in banking and/or investments.  More likely not.  Many upper level executives I know have finance (or accounting) degrees, maybe MBA's, they started as financial analysts, which means interpreting financial numbers, calculating and booking financial entries, etc...but there role now has nothing to do with F&amp;A.  They "grew out" of those roles.  The specialized "world" of banking is actually very small, and most of the "vice presidents" (everyone at a bank is a VP, afterall) at the thousands of Bank of America chains across the U.S. that people consider as "bankers" are relatively low paid, on commission, salesmen whose roles have nothing to do with finance, not really.      I've "grown up" out of finance myself at this point in my career.  Tired of looking at spreadsheets.  Accounting vs. finance, not really much of a difference.  It just depends on what direction you want to steer your career.  Other disciplines are economics, business management...they are almost interchangeable.  One amusing note from my professor from years back however, on comparing accounting to finance:  "Accounting is for people that want to keep score, finance is for people that want to play the game".  He was a finance professor as you can guess.
