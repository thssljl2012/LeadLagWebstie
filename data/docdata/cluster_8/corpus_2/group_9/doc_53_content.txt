  A former exceutive at Merrill today said that Henry Paulson and Ben Bernanke literally 'pressured" Bank of America to purchase Merrill Lynch, and forced Merrill Lynch to fudge their books so the purchase could be made.......  That ladies and gentlemen... is literally fascism.    Why is 'pressured' in quotation marks.... And why isn't 'forced' also in quotation marks?
