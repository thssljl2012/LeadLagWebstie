           The Executive Who Brought Down AIG                   Quote:              The FBI and federal prosecutors are reportedly closing in on the AIG executive whose suspect investments cost the insurance giant hundreds of billions of dollars. The government is investigating whether or not 54-year old Brooklyn-native Joseph Cassano committed criminal fraud in virtually bankrupting the company.                          Quote:              " He almost single-handedly is responsible for bringing AIG down and by reference the economy of this country, " said Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Ca.)             Uh oh.  If that's true, there goes the old "AIG wasn't doing anything everybody else wasn't doing." flimflam.  Not that it was ever an excuse for anything anyway but a lot of people liked to trot it out in defense of the poor little corporation that hadn't done anything to deserve the scorn being heaped upon it.                 Quote:              Cassano,  who lives in London , made more than $300 million running the infamous Financial Products Division of AIG where he, with about a dozen others, committed AIG to insure what turned out to be more than a trillion dollars worth of junk quality loans held by banks.             He'd better be looking around for a place to live in country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the US... maybe a nice ranch in Paraguay.                 Quote:              After the huge losses became known, Cassano was fired from AIG in early 2008,  but he still received a salary of $1 million a month until Congress intervened . AIG has received about a $180 billion in bailout funds so far.             Geez!  Not only did this... this ASSHOLE... play a major part in wrecking our economy but the fricking company was using our money to pay the sonuvabitch for whatever the hell they were paying him for even AFTER it became apparent that he... and by reference, the company... had brought our entire economy to its knees and ceated the worst financial meltdown since 1929.  DAMN!!!!  The arrogance of the entitled nobility in this country STILL amazes me.                 Quote:              Even as the bad loans began to emerge, Cassano boasted to Wall Street analysts that his transactions, called credit default swaps, were foolproof.    "It is hard for us, and without being flippant, to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing $1 in any of those transactions," he said on an AIG investor conference call in August 2007.            And this miserable excuse for a putrid pile of dog crap that walks around on two feet just like real humans is still living the life of luxury in London as if nothing ever happened and will be gone like a fart in a whirlwind at the appearance of a subpoena or an arrest warrant.           Ill tell you what DR... if they get the bastard, you can choose his jail if I get to pick his cell mate.
