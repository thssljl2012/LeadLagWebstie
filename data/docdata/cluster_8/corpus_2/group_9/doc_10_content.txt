     Bank of America couldn't run a wet dream successfully  ....they bought up our bank and turned a bank statement from a one double sided page presentation into a six page fiasco which takes two days out of which to make sense.  I told the new bank manager that he should at least surround himself with employees who have some  accounting background under their belts.  We're hunting  for a new bank after twenty years of having LaSalle Bank.  B of A.....kiss it!                                                          The Bank of America where my store does the night drops can't even successfully file away deposit slips so they're there when I go to pick them up in the morning.     That being said, this has nothing to do with whether they ran a successful organization.     Bottom line is they did. They didn't own toxic assets.     What the Fed did to them was shameful.                                        -Lonesome Steve  IF I KNEW THE WAY; I WOULD TAKE YOU HOME
