The irony is that we gave AIG $11.5 billion so they could meet their obligation to Deutsche Bank. That obligation: Credit Default Swap insurance.  So the German Bank bought the risky US investments hoping to make a profit. In order to hedge their bet, they bought insurance from AIG. AIG in their greed (and stupidity) gladly issued the policy. Meltdown hits; German Bank pulls out the insurance policy; AIG poops its pants; and, our tax dollars save the German Bank.  We are soooo wonderful.
