 comes from the day Bank of America jacked my rates to 24% on an account that was far below the limit, always paid early and more than the minimum and just after I got off the phone with their rude representative, I opened the paper to read that Bank of America execs had just asked the Feds for billions because they were sure their credit card customers were going to default en mass.   The very idea of forcing people into defalut (not me, by the way) and then demaning the same people pay them billions for that, while the administration was speaking only about saving the banks, and acting as if the billions the banks were getting were leading the banks to behave in decent ways toward customers. I got so sick of hearing that the banks were the only thing that mattered, while the banks were so clearly scamming the Feds, taking our tax money, and abusing us as customers.  That article about B of A asking for billions stuck in my craw, and honestly everytime Geitner speaks about helping the banks, I feel he's serving the ones who did and do constant wrong, and I get the feeling that Tim does not even comprehend what the banks are doing. He seems to think they are incapable of anything but good faith, even in the face of all that has happened.  So at least they are talking about this, the one thing that almost all Americans deal with. Defending the people who are shaking us down needs to stop very quickly.
