A person with car insurance is less likely to lock their doors or a person with fire insurance is more likely to smoke in bed.  A bank with insurance that is backed by government bailouts is more likely to act in ways to drive GM into bankruptcy.  It's just a simple fact that people should be aware of.  The bailout of AIG creates a moral hazard.         I don't follow your logic. OK, insurance creates a moral hazard. The hazard was created when Citi and Goldman bought their insurance "swap". The bailout didn't originate it. Although it may perpetuate it. But if we continue on this line we, the taxpayers, don't let AIG fulfill their insurance swap contract. That removes the moral hazard from Citi and Goldman and they have to negotiate with GM to minimize their bond loss. But now a moral hazard is created for the unions. They now don't have to give as much because the bond holders have to give more. And round and round and round we go.  Gets kinda messy doesn't it.
