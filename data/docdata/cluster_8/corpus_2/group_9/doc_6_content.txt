I wonder if Dodd even noticed the $44k from payday lenders. He was getting over five times that ($225,000) from bailout recipients Countrywide ($21k), BofA ($70k), and F.Mac &amp; F.Mae ($140k). It's doubtful that a mere $44k from an entire industry measures up as "influential". Meanwhile, for $70,000 in contributions to Sen. Dodd, Bank of America (just one company) can not only evade Congressional scrutiny, but also get $95billion in bailouts. Heck, Countrywide even threw in a new house for Dodd to sweeten their deal. If anything, this suggests what a high-priced politician Dodd is: if you really want a firm stance from him, you've got to pay through the nostrils like everyone else.
