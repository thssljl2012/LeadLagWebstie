Bank of America CEO has testified that he attempted to pull out of the deal to purchase Merrill Lynch in December, after Merrill's situation deteriorated significantly.   He was told by Bernanke and Paulson that if he went forward with it, he and the Bank of America board would be replaced.   Furthermore, he was instructed not to reveal his intentions or the full extent of Merrill's situation to BofA's shareholders.   That is shareholder fraud, plain and simple with no ambiguity.     When NY state attorney general Cuomo inquired with Paulson about this, Paulson passed the blame to Bernanke, saying that he only did it at the Federal Reserve's behest.  The CEO Lewis betrayed his legal responsibility to protect his shareholders in order to preserve his job, and the jobs of the boardmembers.  This is illegal and he should be arrested.  The Treasury Secretary and Fed Chairman were complicit, ordering him to disobey the law and commit fraud.  Bernanke should be fired and they should both be prosecuted.  This is an outrage.  What is more of an outrage is that absolutely nothing will happen.                      Well, I did make $25k thanks to placing one of the 35,000 people BofA laid off, so that's good. Times are tough for corporate headhunters that specialize in high finance these days so I can't fucking wait for the avalanche of regulation that is just around the corner(professionally speaking, I hate regulation philosophilcally but a nigga's gotta eat). I wish they would hurry the fuck up and pass that Hedge fund transparency bill already and put those fuckers under Finra or SEC oversight soon. That should give me a much needed little bump. This whole crashing economy thing has been a real bring down for me.
