 Thanks for the thanks! and thanks for theSVM notes!  You are right, Keene's work is awesome - he often has excellent guests. The beauty of "podcasts" vs regular TV media is that they have the time to truly explain their position. On TV they are interupted by the commercials and/or commentators. The podcasts are also much more honest - as they are not looking for ratings as much etc..... ie (tout TV, owned by GE).  As for the metals and mining in general:   do not forget:   SELL IN MAY AND GO AWAY  IS ALMOST UPON US!!   do not forget:  the markets have run up 7 weeks in spite of pretty bad economics and unemployment, also we still have no resolution to: GM &amp; Chrysler, Foreclosures, and "opaque US banks". In fact I heard another "podcast" where the bank researcher had spent time looking at various US bank''s "off balance sheet stuff", she was saying that JP Morgan and Citi have combined over a trillion $$ of "stuff" that will have to come on their books by year end. I say that could be a HUGE MESS!!  be careful out there!
