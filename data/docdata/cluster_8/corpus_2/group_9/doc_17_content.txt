 Thank you for reading between my poorly written lines since the phrase "mark down" was missing at the appropriate place. Thought about editing but it'd already been out there a while before I caught it.         ~~~ It's possible for a B tranche to be covered by liquidation value in Year X but become uncovered over time as all the good mortgages prepay and leave the pool with the dregs. ~~~         Thats a legit angle I hadn't considered enough I suppose.         Still, its hard for me to understand why anything represented by an aggregate LTV of say 100% should price at much less than 50% and that would require total failure. Time run off excluded of course and I'm still not happy with at least my perception, (perhaps wrongly so) how this has contributed to a negative feed back loop. ie: the lower you go, the more risk perceived, ratings cut, borrowing costs increase, feeds on itself into its own black hole.         Obviously we are in complete agreement about fake earnings but I wonder if these market driven write downs are fully justified?   msg 128114
