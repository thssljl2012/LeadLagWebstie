There have been SO many actual crimes committed by the Obama administration--actually, by identifiable individuals--in the first 100 days of his administration that it boggles the mind. Some--more than one--achieve the level of high crimes &amp; misdemeanors. It is now not clear that Barack Obama will make it to another election--he will likely be impeached &amp; convicted by the Senate--yes, by a DEMOCRATIC Senate, which will have no choice in the face of enormous public opinion &amp; political pressure to do, finally, the RIGHT THING.  It is a question whether Barack Obama is Constitutionally qualified to be President--he has yet to produce a valid true birth certificate to demonstrate that he is a natural born citizen of the United States. He &amp; members of his administation have taken actions that they have no legal authority to take--like taking over private banks, ordering the CEO of an American automobile manufacturer to resign, and prohibiting financial institutions from repaying TARP funds against their will. And forcing Bank of America to buy Merrill Lynch at an inflated price some $15 billion more than it was KNOWN to be worth. This was in direct violation of Federal securities laws and constitutes a colossal fraud on the shareholders of Bank of America. Several well-known people in Obama's administration should go to prison on this one issue alone.  The draining of the Federal treasury is likely a crime in itself. And who really knows what has been done behind closed doors, out of sight of the media &amp; the American people. But considering that the Treasury has been raided and the speed with which ALL this has been done, we can be fairly certain that most of what has been done is illegal and without constitutional authority of any kind. Befor we are done we may see virtually the entire leadership of the Democratic Party holding campaign rallies INSIDE Leavenworth Federal Prison in Kansas.
