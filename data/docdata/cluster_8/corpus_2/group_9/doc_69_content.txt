 dude. get real. caught out on a limb? let's remember where BAC was 24 hours ago. No one is short from today except the amateurs. Most are short well into the high nines and tens.     out on a limb, think not.     and Bank of America, however you want to slice it, in the real world, is dead broke.     the sickening thing is, before the Fed/Treasury admit defeat, Tyler's piece seems to indicate that they are willing to take down all the banks that are actually okay.     sickening. sickening. sickening. if you weren't so brain dead about what's really going on, i suggest you write your Congressman/Senators....    if they go thru with this, it is outright rape, blatant, flagrant, in neon glowing colors of the US Taxpayers.           msg 4560
