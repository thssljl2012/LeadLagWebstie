I think in some way having AIG bailed out propped up companies that bought CDS on bad assets, whether as gamble or insurance, these companies would have lose something if AIG fails along the way.  Risk cannot be destroyed, it can only be diverted and distributed. If AIG has to fail, then too many good business along the way would fail too, like the people who bought bond insurances, business insurances, health insurances, CDS for legitimate causes rather than gambling, and the fear of all insurance companies and business deals that require escrows, insurances, loans, etc.  It shouldn't happen in the first place. Insurance and banks should be regulated so that not allowed to write contracts that can get itself out of businesses.
