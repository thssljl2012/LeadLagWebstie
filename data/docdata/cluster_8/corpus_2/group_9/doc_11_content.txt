Your attempt to blame it on FM &amp; FM is election year politics.             Again, the need for the AFLAK duck.  Didn't the election happen like 3 weeks ago?           Quote:                  The real problem was too many people who could afford housing taking out loans for houses they really could not afford.   And second mortgages and then equity loans. Those loans given by the "Rock Financials" and the like.  They in turn sold the loans off to company's who took out insurance on the loans from AIG who ended up insuring more than they could cover... way more.   The other culprit was Moodys and Standard &amp; Poors rating AIG and other such insurers way to high for too long.  This was dishonest.   Where did government fail?  It allowed this happen by not properly regulating and providing oversight.   Almost every time this nation has had an economic downturn it is becasue of the securities market doing something very wrong.             Yep, agree with all of this.  However, the catalyst of this problem was longer ago when the government decided it should be policy to put people into houses that generally could not afford those houses.  Then, in turn, they double downed on a bad policy again.
