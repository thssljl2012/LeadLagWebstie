My understanding of the powerplay is the Govt. trying to give the FDIC enough framework to wind-down a large institution, especially one that has a holding company. The reason for this change is the WMI lawsuit. The OTS, FDIC, Treasury have learned a valuable lesson. Whether or not collusion was involved is something I don't want to waste time thinking about. (Inner Circle connections we may never learn about). I've seen Shelia Bair on t.v. where she mentioned that the FDIC could not wind down citibank b/c they had a holding company and are too big to fail. Lesson learned and she knows they were wrong with WMI and WMB. At the same time, WMI filed what I assume to be the largest lawsuit against the FDIC ever. On that Friday's announcement, Tim Geitner decided to release the news of TARP details. CNBC wondered what the Treasury dept. was trying to hide with this news so late on Friday. They were successful in stopping mainstream mass media exposure of the lawsuit against the FDIC that could possibly create a run on the banks. In addition, the FDIC is asking for more money to cover the banks that are failing, and hopefully the WMI mess. It's strange to watch the motivation behind movements in D.C. and understand them. (I think) I've heard Wednesday is possibly the vote on the FDIC monetary increase. I think WMI is golden. IMO
