       Definition of  "Conflict of interest" :  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest    "A conflict of interest occurs when an individual or organization (such as a lawyer, insurance adjuster, politician, engineer, executive, director of a corporation, medical research scientist, physician, writer, editor, or an individual or organization cited as a source) has an interest that might compromise their reliability. A conflict of interest exists even if no improper act results from it, and can create an appearance of impropriety that can undermine confidence in the conflicted individual or organization."     http://www.gata.org/node/7341   Summers got millions in fees from bailed-out banks Submitted by cpowell on Fri, 2009-04-03 23:57.
