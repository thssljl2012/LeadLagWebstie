   LEWIS: BECKY, I THINK WE'RE AT A POINT WHERE YOU'RE SEEING MIXED SIGNALS. JUST SMALL MIXED SIGNALS.SOME HOUSING SALES ARE BETTER THAN YOU THINK OR CAR SALES NOT BEING QUITE AS BAD AS YOU THINK, AND WHEN YOU SEE THE MIXED SIGNALS, I THINK IT'S SIGNALS THAT YOU ARE GETTING CLOSE TO BOTTOM, AND SO WE WOULD ACTUALLY SHARE THE CONSENSUS THAT IN THE SECOND HALF THINGS MODERATE IN TERMS OF THE DECLINE AND THAT WE HIT BOTTOM IN THE SECOND HALF AND THAT WE START TO COME OUT OF THIS AND IN THE FIRST PART OF NEXT YEAR. YOU CAN'T THROW AS MANY THINGS AS WE'RE THROWING AT IT AND NOT BREAK THE BACK OF THIS THING.      QUICK: YOU'VE BEEN SEEING THESE MIXED SIGNS FOR HOW LONG?      LEWIS: THE LAST FEW MONTHS. THE OTHER THING, TOO, IS DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE REFIS, AND THAT WILL PUT A LOT OF MONEY IN PEOPLE'S POCKETS, AND WE'VE NEVER SEEN VOLUME SAYS LIKE WE'RE SEEING $5 BILLION A DAY APPLICATION DAYS, AND THAT'S GOING TO PUT -- REDUCE A LOT OF MONTHLY PAYMENTS.      QUICK: YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE A HUGE INSIGHT TO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE MORTGAGE MARKET THROUGH COUNTRYWIDE AND THROUGH YOUR OTHER OPERATIONS AS WELL. HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU HAVE WORKING ON NOT ONLY REFINANCING, BUT ALSO REWORKING OUT MORTGAGE AGREEMENTS FROM THE PAST?      LEWIS: BY THE WAY, ON APRIL 24TH WE CHANGED THE NAME. IT BECOMES BANK OF AMERICA HOME LOANS. THAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN.      QUICK: ACTUALLY KNEW THAT BECAUSE YOU OWN MY MORTGAGE, TOO.      LEWIS: 5,000 PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON MODIFYING LOANS AT THE MOMENT.      QUICK: HOW -- WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING IN THOSE LOAN MODIFICATIONS PROCESS?      LEWIS: THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT AND CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF THE CUSTOMER WILL COME TO US AND TALK TO US AND WORK WITH US. WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE SENSE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE -- WE DON'T HAVE TO FORECLOSE AND DO ALL THE UGLY THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO DO WHEN YOU DO FORECLOSE. IT IS HAVING A POSITIVE IMPACT.         -------------------------------------------------------------------------         Longs, Just remember they don't ring a BELL when the bottom is reached. I think BAC is GROSSLY UNDERVALUED. I'm buying on every dip &amp; woll load up the Truck.         Kirby
