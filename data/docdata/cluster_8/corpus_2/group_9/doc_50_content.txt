Doesn't look good for Paulson and Bernake.     The irony of the whole thing is Cuomo referring this to the Bwarney Fwrank and Chris Dudley Dodd.      As if those two have any moral authority on this.     They are neck deep in the doo-doo themselves.     It never ends, just the parties switch power.                       Well, lets see here. I really don't think Franky boy or Dodd had anything to do with Bernanke/Paulson business wise and or were responsible for installing the guys in their posts. After all this financial mess that we are seeing did not just pop up over night, this has taken years and certainly more than two years to get to this point.
