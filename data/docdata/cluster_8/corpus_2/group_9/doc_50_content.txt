That now their paying PIRATE INSURANCE TOO! LOL  I'd like some Republican to explain what this has to do with trial lawyers. I thought, according to them, businesses only got shook down by insurance companies because of "frivolous" lawsuits.  Maybe we can use this as an example of why we don't want insurance companies in the Healthcare business anymore!  PS  Wouldn't be funny if they all had AIG for an insurance company.                                               ...
