That poor bastard.  He tried to back out of the deal when he saw they had been less tha honest about how deeply troubled Merrill Lynch was, and they made him an offer he couldn't refuse.  THey forced him to do the deal, and now the Board is going to force him out.    I hope he goes to Hong King or India and screws the US royally by contributing to the power structure of the opposition and competition.
