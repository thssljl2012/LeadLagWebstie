   The following is the credit mentality the banks have to deal with and now we too as taxpayers because of TARP money?  Does she mention WHY her interest went up?  Past due, over limit, etc etc ??  Or just on a whim by the bank?  *For cardholders like Carol Chapman, the legislation is overdue.   "I think someone should have done this a long time ago," she told CBS News correspondent Bill Plante.   Chapman said the interest on her card has gotten so outrageous - jumping from 1.9 percent to 29.99 percent - that she's "at the point now I will not pay at all."   The credit card issuers include the same big banks - Bank of America, Citicorp and JPMorgan Chase - that have gotten billions in bailout money meant to stimulate consumer lending, reports Plante.*   So beacuse they got taxpayer money they should be more lenient with taxpayers who don't pay their bills?  AND SO NOW SHE IS NOT GOING TO PAY AT ALL????  Great - another defaulting borrower and loan loss for the banks.  And in this case an unsecured debt - the bank or Freddie or Fannie cannot even minimize their losses by selling the real estate like with a mortgage!!!
