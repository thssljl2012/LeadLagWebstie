I wouldn't touch Citibank with a 10 foot pole. Govt owns 36% of them and if they convert TARP into common stock it's just going to rise. I would wait till the summer and reevaluate from there. I will admit at those prices I was tempted but the calls weren't selling for enough for me to work out my investing strategy. The other big thing was having Obama in control with his poll-tested presidency, hence why we get Summers talking about restricting credit card rates last Sunday.
