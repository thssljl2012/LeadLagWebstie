I just want to know when am I going to get everything I want...When am I going to get the wealth that My hardworking sister and brother in law have because they were able to go out and buy their own company...when do I get my own company...surely 100 days is enough time to get me my own company.  When am I going to get my share of the wealth from guys like Warren Buffet...and Bernie Madoff...Why don't they just confiscate all of the money from these guys and pass it out to us...100 days is enought to get all that done.  When are people going to stop attacking our interests...like US registered cargo ships sending food and supplies to Africa...blowing up soldiers trying to do their jobs...I thought for sure the world would fall in Love with us again within 100 days.  When are the banks going to start loaning money again...Bank of America...just made 44 billion dollars last quarter...and upon that announcement...the stock market tanks...why?  Because they said that they were going to pay itself to cover old losses...I thought Obama was going to get the money flowing again by now...100 days isn't enough.  And on top of that...he preached change...what did he do...he surrounded himself with Clintonistas...How is that change...we are doing the same failed things tht happened in the Clinton admin...that allowed terrorists to get the courage to attack us in bigger ways...and whats more, he is a Chicago politician who has surrounded himself with innercircle Chicago thug politicians like RAHM EMMANUEL...        What about Nancy Pelosi...didn't she have a 100 day plan to...where has she been since the trainwreck stimulus bill?  you know the one that allowed AIG to pay bonuses legally, then she and other democrats nashed their teeth together and wagged the shame on you finger at AIG...What has congress done in its' first 100 days...Other than that travisty...NOTHING&gt;&gt;&gt;because they are absolutely handcuffed by re election campaigning which starts in earnest this summer...They don't want to do anything that will kill their chances to be re elected...        So don't give me all of this mumbo jumbo that OBAMA and the DEMOCRATS are doing such a great job...He aint done crap for the first 100 days...You cannot convince me otherwise...I was even supporting him for acting on the Navy Seal rescue of Captain Phillips until I learned from a friend in the NAVY that they were told not to do anything unless his life was in immenant danger...I heard it put best...when told that pirates had attacked one of our cargo ships and the captain was being held hostage he was asked what the proper course of action should be...OBAMA simply voted present!
