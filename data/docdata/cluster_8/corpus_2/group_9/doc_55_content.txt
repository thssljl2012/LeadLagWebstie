Answer: It's not. The Swiss have simply decided that the profits to be made by laundering Arafat's money were more important than the suffering of the Palestinian people. And they feel the same for other dictators as well.       is it a federal law or state? if federal can you link to it? so i can compare them to ours?       http://www.efd.admin.ch/dokumentatio...x.html?lang=en       btw, its nice to see you care for the Palestinain people for once.
