     &gt;The Bank of America where my store does the night drops can't even successfully file away deposit slips so they're there when I go to pick them up in the morning.             That being said, this has nothing to do with whether they ran a successful organization.             Bottom line is they did. They didn't own toxic assets.             What the Fed did to them was shameful.      DoGG           I have as much sympathy for banks as I do for drunks        ZIP   ON BOTH COUNTS!
