support failing businesses is good for a short term solution but they are failing for a reason and should be allowed to fall, it will suck for a while but the aftermath is much brighter and cheaper than spending trillions to give things a LITTLE boost for a LITTLE while.      and alll those things belong to the government now, the more bailouts the more the government controls, the more government controls the more you can refer the united states as a socialist nation
