Bank of America is full of it. The money was offered, and the banks TOOK it. B of A took it then claimed they didn't need it? Bunch of lying jerkaholics if you ask me. They just want this to blow over as quick as possible and spin it that they were healthy all along. Return the money and shut up B of A and start LENDING.
