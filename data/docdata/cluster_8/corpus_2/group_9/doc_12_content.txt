         Hey guys,  I am hardly promoting his book, and really posted here, only asking reading the work if worthwhile.  I think we all agree that 'Of Permanent Value', 'Intelligent Investor', 'Poor Charlies Almanack' etal, are all worthwhile.  Surely some here have had experience with 'The Four Filters Invention of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.' .  Any thoughts or constructive comments appreciated.  email or posts are cool.     this is how Bud Labitan describes and mentions his book    Some Secrets embedded in the "Four Filters" Book.    by Bud Labitan     I have had some interesting comments from a few bloggers who have not read my book. So, a thoughtful response is posted here about what makes this book unique. On the surface, my book, The Four Filters Invention of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger at [ www.frips.com ] appears to be just a reiteration of Buffett and Munger ideas. But, a keen and perceptive reader will notice that it goes deeper.   My assertion is that Buffett and Munger's Four Filter process advances Behavioral Finance, because it captures all the major stakeholders in these four thinking steps. Since our personal "Circles of Competence" or "Latticeworks of Understanding" will be imperfect. The goal should be to build upon them not with trivia, but with valuable tidbits and insights. Add a little bit more to each cluster: Products, Customers, Managers, Margin of Safety.    My book strives to prove that Buffett and Munger invented a unique Behavioral Finance process composed of three qualitative steps and one quantitative step, that is underappreciated by the business and academic communities. In this respect, they built more value onto the framework discussed and practiced by Ben Graham, Phil Fisher, Philip Carret, and others.   "The Four Filters Invention of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger" is a short story about how their process works in terms of framing and Behavioral Finance. Judge it as a work describing an advance in "decision framing" and a historical step forward, underappreciated and under-recognized in the field of Behavioral Finance.   The book explains how each of the four filter steps acts like a method of "framing" a decision from different angles. Think U for Understanding the economics of a Business and its and products, SCA for Sustainable Competitive Advantage, ATM for Able &amp; Trustworthy Managers, and MOS for Margin of Safety obtained from buying below Intrinsic Value.   The "Wow" moment comes when you realize that they (Buffett and Munger) designed a sequential Behavioral Finance process that includes all the main characters necessary to have a successful and enduring business; (Products, Enduring Customers, Managers, and Margin of Safety). In my view, the "Four Filters" are a big contribution to the field of Behavioral Finance.       - - The book's design - - -        MS: Tell me about your book's design, and why did you structure it in the way you did?    BL: In 1949, Warren Buffett said that his life was transformed by reading Ben Graham's "The Intelligent Investor." So, "Four Filters Invention" is really the 2008-2009 version of sensible intelligent investing updated by the amazing innovation of Buffett and Munger.    Interestingly, it arrives on the scene 50 years after their meeting in 1959.   I encourage keen minds to discover the hidden gems within the text. Having listened to many hours of audio lectures and interviews, I have been consistently interested in how Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger "frame" an investment decision, and how they find a winning investment prospect. This book is a story about the rational four filter process that help Buffett and Munger make better investing decisions. In the words of Charlie Munger, "You have to understand the odds and have the discipline to bet only when the odds are in your favor."    BL: Here is a bit about my book design process. My first intent was to write a book that my 16 year old daughter could read and appreciate on basic and motivational levels, depending on the level of her emotional maturity at the times that she reads it.(16, 20, 25, 30 and so on...)    I also wanted to tell this amazing story of how two brilliant friends innovated a major advance in Behavioral Finance, made a lot of money, and Behavioral Finance hardly noticed the intellectual achievement. (because it sounds so much like common sense.)    BL: Their brilliance was to take the "state-of-the-art" ideas after Ben Graham, blend it with ideas from Carret, Fisher, and Munger, and move the sequence around, compress it into 4 steps, and place the three most important words of Margin of Safety (IV estimation calculation) in the 4th and final step. Here is the audio clip to prove that sequence matters:   http://www.frips.com/4filters.mp3     BL: When I wrote this book, I tried to adhere very closely to Buffett and Munger's writings and speeches. There are however, transition sentences, that are designed to motivate like the book by Jim Collins' called "Good To Great."    The key to appreciating my book is to read it a second time outloud. There are areas where subtle motivators have been planted to keep the "tone" upbeat and motivational. Look for areas where I write "we can" and "consider" and "may" and "optimize." ... subtle motivators. After all, this book is about learning the optimal way to "frame" our tough decisions and consider the major stakeholders in any decision.    BL: Here are the "layers" I imagined in designing this book:    1. 4-filters "decision framing" innovation of Buffett and Munger    2. Contributions to the notion of checklists from Munger, Fisher, Carret    3. A bit on how the 4-filters expand out the latticework of understanding    4. "subtle motivators" in transition sentences    5. My assertion that Buffett and Munger advanced Behavioral Finance by getting all the major stakeholders into this 4 step process. (if they were academics; worthy of Nobel in Economics and Behavioral Finance)    6. a motivator for my Daughter to "think rationally" when she grows up.        MS: Can you tell us a little about The Four Filters?   BL: "The Four Filters Invention of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger" is about the amazing intellectual partnership of two brilliant men; and their contribution to "decision framing." I came to the realization that the 4 filters encapsulate all the important stakeholders. Warren Buffett has talked about the Four Filters in several ways. This behavioral sequence is always similar: "Charlie and I look for companies that have a) a business we understand; b) favorable long-term economics; c) able and trustworthy management; and d) a sensible price tag. Buffett has also phrased the Four Filter process in this way: "When buying companies or common stocks, we look for understandable first-class businesses, with enduring competitive advantages, accompanied by first-class managements, available at a bargain price." These ideas sound so simple. Many people hear them at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in Omaha each year. Yet, I suspect that few people have stopped to think about the importance and effectiveness of each individual filter. My book discusses each of the four clusters and tehn presents a brief case study on their Kraft stock purchase.     MS: Your decision to pick Kraft (KFT) in the book was very wise. How did you go about choosing that stock over all others?    BL: I cannot claim wisdom here. Kraft was added to Dow Industrials after the plunge in AIG. But, I could not have predicted this. Kraft, KFT, is the valuation case example discussed after chapter 4 of my book. Back in March of 2008, I chose it over doing a valuation on "Bank of America" because I thought that folks could relate better to a food company they know from tasty brands. Kraft cheeses, dinners and dressings; Oscar Mayer meats; Philadelphia cream cheese; Maxwell House coffee; Nabisco cookies and crackers and its Oreo brand; Jacobs coffees, Milka chocolates and LU biscuits. Kraft has more than 50 additional brands with revenues of at least $100 million. I like the A1 steak sauce. Respected brands can translate into some measure of pricing power.    By the way, before I forget, this book can also be used as a supplemental text for classes: Valuation, Decision Sciences, Investments, and "Mixed Qualitative and Quantitative Modeling." I think it helps to tech young people how to frame important decisions using the relevant players.     MS: Any thoughts about the financial crisis now?    BL: Buffett and Munger both warned everyone in 2002 about the dangers of derivatives as financial Weapons of Mass Destruction. Now, we will all pay in the form of higher taxes or deflated purchasing power.     MS: What amount of research is required to obtain a "Circle of Competence"?    BL: This is the toughest question you have asked. I do not know the answer. But, allow me to speculate intelligently and use Ben Graham's tenth lecture as a reference. In that tenth lecture, Graham is saying goodbye to his class. He knows that many of them will go out to Wall Street and speculate. In essence, he tells them that if they do, try to do so with some measure of intelligent thinking using their learned knowledge and sense of probabilities. In summary, use a margin-of-safety and try to limit potential losses. Now, fast forward in time to 1977 and the Buffett and Munger era. My assertion is that Buffett and Munger's Four Filter process advances Behavioral Finance because it captures all the major stakeholders in these four thinking steps. Since our personal "Circles of Competence" or "Latticeworks of Understanding" will be imperf...
