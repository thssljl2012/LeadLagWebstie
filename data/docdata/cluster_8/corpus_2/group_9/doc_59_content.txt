I wonder if this story will blow up or of it'll kind of quietly go away?      Because politics is a team game. While they bicker about which side is to blame both laugh their way to the bank.      You get elected by demonizing the other party and hiding similarities and points of agreement.  In reality there's very little difference between the parties and candidates that we are provided to choose from.     "I'm John Jackson and I think this plan goes too far!"  "I'm Jack Johnson and I think this plan doesn't go too far enough!"
