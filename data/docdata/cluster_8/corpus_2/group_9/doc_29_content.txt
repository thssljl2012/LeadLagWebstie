       Quote (SignoraVecchia &#064; Tue, Apr 21 2009, 12:04pm)   yep.  what do u think , did the us bank crisis cause this recession? and therefore spread all over the world     The real estate market was the root issue, but the banks reponse to the bubble was the catalyst. I would venture as far as to say that never in our history have we witnessed such ineptitude and stupidity in the banking sector as we did in the years preceding this recession. Giving people $300,000 loans on a $40,000 a year salary with no down payment is complete madness. These banks deserve to fail and be nationalized with ownership stripped from the board of directors of these banks and their shares auctioned off once the bank is re-privatized.    Quote    Since when was the most important thing figuring out whom to blame?     not so much who as what  Those that don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.
