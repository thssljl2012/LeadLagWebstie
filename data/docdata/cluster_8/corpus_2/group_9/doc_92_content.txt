JP Morgan is supposedly ground zero for any further weakening in the derivatives market. And compared to Citi, BoA's exposure, while still dangerous, is a lot smaller.       I'm guessing a combination of TARP and the immediacy of the losses (not enough time to get creative with the books) is bothering BoA more than swallowing Merrill. Merrill is the type of purchase BoA would want right now if they could. They just got billions and billions of taxpayer money to do it, at the unintended expense of their share price. It's like bitching about a handout not being a 100% pure handout.       They think they're in a position to be one of the stronger and sounder banks that doesn't need to suck the government's teet. Everything's relative at the moment, so that delusion has some tread...
