 I am one of 90 million people nationwide who dont have insurance.  Thats just a little over 1 in 3 ppl.  I understand that is YOUR opinion and that is fine, but you are saying that there are potentially 90 million or more ppl in our country that are irresponsible for having/wanting children without insurance and I dont think that is fair, that is my opinion.          Quoting Tea4Tas:     DD doesnt have insurance, we pay for office visits out of pocket.  I thank God that in the last 2 years she has only needed well check ups.  I know it is not my RIGHT to have another baby.  I am glad that your friend is in the position to spend that sort of money on having a child, I wish I was.  I am not asking for a hand out, I just think there should be lower cost options when needing help to concieve.  You have people in the US who pop out kid after kid just to get a bigger govt. check each month, then you have ppl like me who just really want to add to our family but cant because I am not able to refinance a mortgage.  If you must know, I am in the process of shopping around for a good insurance plan, excuse me for hitting a low point in my life and needing to vent, Im sorry that it is beyond you to understand.          No it isn't I am one of those people who needed help with my last child.    I htink our entire cost was a tad over 30K.     I find it irresponsible to try and have children with no medical insurance.      It's a recipe for disaster-or to wind up asking the taxpayers to foot the bill.      Ditto for having a child and having no insurance.  Perhaps you should  consider getitng insurance before TTC another child.    Resolve might be able to help you, but without medical insurance they also might not.
