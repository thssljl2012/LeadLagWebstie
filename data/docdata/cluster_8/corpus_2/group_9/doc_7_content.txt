       Those are the intricate tactics of Disinformation:  In some parts I rather tend to not agree.  Heres why:  It is not (not only, save for short term political gains) that the government wanted to help...it is that they are held hostage by the banks.   So... the underlying agenda is still to distract readers from the main reasons of the crash:  -Lack of regulation;  -irresponsible lending,  -excess leverage.  All homemade problems leading to the disallocation of capital and annihilation of U.S. manufacturing etc.  The next distraction is the topic of intemediaries, SPVs or "middlemen"    The administration believes it can sidestep the rules because, in many cases, it has decided not to provide federal aid directly to financial companies, the sources said. Instead, the government has set up special entities that act as middlemen, channeling the bailout funds to the firms and, via this two-step process, stripping away the requirement that the restrictions be imposed, according to officials.     By saying this it distracts from AIG which was the poster child of a middleman to funnel money to commercial and investment banks without disclosure by first creating (or declaring) an "emergency" which has yet to be proven,then seize it and ultimately abuse it to bail out the so called "counterparties" of AIG on the pure existence of arbitrary insurance contracts.   In short: they didnt need to create a middleman - much easier, they were looking for a counterparty big and opaque enough to seize and then to serve as a tool for the larger cause. (The fact that Lehman was allowed to fail rather than to be used as a governmental conduit just underscores that it was "not too big to fail" in a nearly comical twist. Plus, the other banks wanted Lehman off the table but can live with a castrated AIG).  We will see many articles which plainly disinform readers and distract them from the real shenanigans.
