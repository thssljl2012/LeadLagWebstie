The handouts have to be paid back somehow:       - Exports to go through the roof   - Raise Taxes   - Slash Spending   - Print Money       Typical of Aust, we have nothing to show for the money being spent.  It's all been pissed up aganst the wall.       Lock your Home Loan Rates in.... this will be get 80's type ugly again.  And pray you keep your job.           P.S.  Credit / Finance to Buyers in the Car Industry has slowly been tightening up over the last 9 months.  Nothing really major.  But 2 weeks ago, Financiers have tightened the criteria right up and made it very hard.  Its a very stark contrast, 2 weeks ago the tap was 90% open, now its 50%.       Something major happened 2 x weeks ago and to me it feels like the banks / finance are sitting on explosive data and are battening up the hatches as they have just shat themselves.                      I was told that CBA has seen a blow out in mortgage defaults, but I am not sure whether it was localised or not.  Also I suspect it is not being helped by:      1. Costs of borrowing offshore and access to funds   2. Poor returns in cash, leading people to start to swtich cash to equities and other investement classes.  Even a growth stock will beat most cash rates now.      The other problem as I see it for industries like the car industry is that the people who can afford to buy a car ie roll leases, are probably not going to as these are the ones who Rudd is going after in his budget.  Rudd seems to be mistaken that people will at least spend at the same rate when he takes more of their income away.  They will not, they will pay down debt and refuse to engage with the govt on anything.
