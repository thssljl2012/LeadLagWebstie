 i don't have time to read thoroughly,but many aspects of the Brit plan are versions of the Swedish plan...and others involve loans that are not the "non-recourse" (investors don't have to ever pay taxpayers back if their investments go bad) loans of the U.S. bank bailout....  but, K has discussed various plans and steps in detail, all along
