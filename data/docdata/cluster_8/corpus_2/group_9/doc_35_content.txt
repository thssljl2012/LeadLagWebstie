 In my opinion Tyler is a paid Troll         What about a bunch of Bull Sh*t. These shorts must be caught out on a limb &amp; they are just crazy with fear about the all clear the treasury will be giving the banks. I sure trust The Secretary of the treasury a hell of a lot more than a short trying to save his hide. Remember Shortie ""Don't Fight the FED &amp; especially when the treasury is with them.         Shortie Bank of America earned 44 cents a share after reserving 16 billion for potential losses.              Kirby    msg 4556
