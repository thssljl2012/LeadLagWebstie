   Bank of America looks good as they are refusing to price their toxic assets (Lewis says they are holding for the long term) and the stalling of foreclosures. He is pumping up the share price so he can get relected to once again misdirect this company, The talent over at Merill Lynch cannot jump ship fast enough.  There is so much toxic waste from the Countrywide side with their fraud ....it is mind blowing. The Countrywide side did  well- as they could pick their own appraisers until recently. There is a list of favored appraisers used today . So who would not do well when you stack the deck? The Countrywide loan side mostly prevailed over the Bank of America side so why would they not have the numbers? The problem arises when these deals go belly up and they always go belly up. So Bank of America not only has toxic waste from the historical activity but they have toxic waste being generated as I type this. They are just hoping the  fees blance the foreclosures.
