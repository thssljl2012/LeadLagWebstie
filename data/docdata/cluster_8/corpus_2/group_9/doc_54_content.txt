My opinion on this matter is that AIG has to much foreign interest and in a roundabout way allows the U.S. to have control over them? Think about it.......AIG has insurance plans for insurance plans all over the globe.......including plans that cover all of the failing banks..........so in a way as evil as it may seem.............the collapse in the market may have been a very well orchestrated plan............could it be so the rich could get richer while AIG or should I say the taxpayers pay for the insurance claims. Makes you wonder doesn't it?????
