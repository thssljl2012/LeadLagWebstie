I like Bank of America. Seriously undervalued right now.       And I don't see why banks, who own the majority of residences in this country, don't ramp up their home loan departments as a common business model with a better real estate resale arm. Ramp it up to a market quality real estate agency and get better prices on resell, thereby alleviating hits from foreclosures. Tons of finance guys looking for jobs. Pay them shit for two years and get them to flip the houses they made bad loans on. Their employment depends on their performance. Check your hair gel at the door.
