$170 billion of public funds were spent on keeping AIG afloat and some people are upset about the fact that a large part of that money went to pay off some European banks which took out insurance contracts with AIG on the the crappy bonds they bought from US investment banks. At the same time the Fed is refusing to reveal the name of these European banks which became the ultimate beneficiaries of public bailout funds. Of course we do not know what the Fed knows. Could it be that the US Treasury was threatened by European central banks to sell US Treasuries on a large scale if AIG would default on its insurance contracts? If that hypothesis is true, then the treasury had no choice: the treasury market must be defended regardless of the cost. A sinking treasury market would mark the end of the Dollar.
