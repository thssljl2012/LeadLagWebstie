                        Quote:           RhodeIslandRed                                           What I find hilarious is that they do it so shamelessly and publicly.  Moreover, these execs make multiples over the average American wage.  It would be nothing for the board of directors (which I understand is now 80% owned by the gov't and people) to state they are suspending bonuses.                                                     Okay, lets do that.  So are you willing to do the samething with the Auto Workers Union.  A contract is a contract and if the gov can break one why they can't break others.  AIG made money the last two monthes and I'm assuming the bonuses are from those profits.  If you want the contracts broken then the companies need to go through chapter 11.
