 To me there is a difference between knowing salary amounts and knowing bonuses. They aren't the same to me.  Bonuses should not be secret.       BOA probably gives out bonuses the way one of my former employees did - the favorites get the most money no matter how good they were, the men get more money than the women and minorities in the same jobs, the bosses mistresses gets more than the other secretaries, etc.
