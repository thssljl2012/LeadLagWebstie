I thought the more interesting bit was when Bunning, I think, tried to lay the blame for AIG on the NY State Insurance regulator and Bernanke said that the Insurance regulator had no authority to regulate the Financial Services unit(s) of AIG. So Bunning instantly dropped that. Isn't that something Bunning should have known before he even tried to put forth such an argument? It's as though he ran with some theory spit out during a talk radio show and didn't bother to check it's validity before putting it forth in a Q &amp; A with the Fed Chairman.
