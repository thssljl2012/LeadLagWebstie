Furthermore, anyone stupid enough to buy insurance from them is just that, they better not expect to make a claim on it.  In that case they are simply donating to the company.                      You hit it right on the head WRS.  AIG is pure junk and these ratings are beyond fiction, they're bad sci-fi.  The fact is AIG has been nationalized for all intents and purposes and the fictional rating is based on the premise that the US is AAA.
