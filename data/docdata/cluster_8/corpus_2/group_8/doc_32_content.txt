Well, to quote Jerry Pournelle, "any company that is too large to be allowed to fail is too large, and ought to be subject to anti-trust regulation." It's time someone in Washington D.C. to start emulating Teddy Roosevelt and break-up the AIGs, CitiGroup, and Bank of Americas.     Had the Bush Administration not sheltered this companies from antitrust actions brought on by  the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission there might not have been a bailout.  The current neoconservative majority of the United States Supreme Court and the lesser appellate courts will make it difficult for a new presidential administration to bring the change needed to correct the imbalances fostered by the Bush Administration. But you Tea Party people wouldn't know anything about that.
