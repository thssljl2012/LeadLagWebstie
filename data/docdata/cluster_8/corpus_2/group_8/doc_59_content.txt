Acorn got money and lots of it from citi, indymac, bank of america i am talking billions for loans for people who did not qualify as a matter of fact they or some were unelmployed. And now these same people are getting the housing money and double dipping. It makes me sooooo sick. They were thick as thieves corrupt and should be in jail                      Can you back up any of that?  Which party controlled Congress in 1998 anyway?
