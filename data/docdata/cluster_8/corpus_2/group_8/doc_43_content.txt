Yes.      by: Cetin Hakimoglu   March 05, 2009    about stocks:     AIG     /     BAC     /     C     /     GM     /     MA     /     V                       Cetin Hakimoglu                This is the most overhyped recession in all of history. The unrelenting bombardment of doom and gloom has permeated though all mediums of information whether it's the TV, the blogosphere, Twitter, or the newspaper. Everyday there are headlines bemoaning rising unemployment, failing financial companies, job loss, stores closing, and falling consumer confidence.   Ironically, it is this incessant assault of negativity that is actually making the recession worse by creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. But are things really that bad?   Sure there are problems, but they are being blown out of proportion. In addition, the media is failing to report the numerous bright spots in the economy.    To be honest, I don't fully grasp this supposed financial crisis. My knowledge is tenuous; people were given mortgages they couldn't pay and derivatives, and CDOs?? I dunno. To go out on a limb, I wouldn't even call it a financial crisis all all. How preposterous you say? Banks are failing,    AIG   ,    BAC   , and Citi (   C   ) are losing tens of billions, people are foreclosing,    GM    can't sell cars; how do you have the gall to make such brazen claims?       Obviously there is a crisis!        But is there?      In actuality, this is a mild recession and hardly a financial or credit crisis. For one, consumer spending, credit, and retail spending continue to rise.     Consumer consumption:             Personal Income:             Consumer Credit:            Citibank is NOT the US economy. Neither is AIG. GM is not either.    Although this recession will result in a small dip in these figures, since 1980 the trend has been virtually uninterrupted. How can you truly have a financial crisis when Visa (   V   ) and Mastercard (   MA   ), for example, continue to report profit and surging growth? Somehow miraculously consumers are still able to max out their credit cards and take out home and business loans despite the 'worst' financial crisis since the Great Depression. This is the miracle that no one wants to talk about, but exists.    What about unemployment! People losing their jobs! Run to the hills!    Lets take a step back, shall we? Unemployment stands at 7.6%. The upper end of the historical average unemployment overage is around 6%. Therefore the current unemployment rate is just 1.6% higher than the upper end of the historic range. To put that in perspective, imagine 100 dots with each dot representing an employee:         The rise in unemployment from 5.5% to 7.5% is equivalent to removing just two of those dots. That's all. Hardly a depression.    Also it seems illogical and preposterous how the viability of the US economy somehow hinges on five or so companies (Citi, BAC, AIG,    GE   , GM) which have a market cap of just $100 billion; a tiny fraction of the entire S&amp;P 500.    I will concede that there are potential pitfalls, namely savings rates have increased from 0% to 5%, and it would be detrimental to the US and global economy if this figure continues to increase. However, it is far too early to infer that this will become a permanent trend. It is hard to blame consumers for being skittish when they are constantly inundated with headlines proclaiming financial Armageddon.    Then there's Silicon Valley. In the Bay Area a contest is being held where entrepreneurs can pitch their business plans for a chance to win $25,000 in seed money. This IS where the growth is; mainly in Web 2.0 and clean energy. Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, for example, continue to report record traffic &amp; revenue according to comScore and are leading the Web 2.0 boom. Companies like Apple (   AAPL   ), Google (   GOOG   ), and Research in Motion (   RIMM   ) are reporting record revenue. However, the media is largely ignoring these success stories and is instead obsessed with job losses, credit crunch, deep recession, financial crisis, and falling consumer confidence.      In conclusion, I implore readers to take the doom and gloom with a huge grain of salt  .   Yes, we are in a recession and a severe bear market, but the longer term trend of prosperity remains intact  . Falling consumer spending, and increase in personal savings will be temporary. I recommend focusing your attention and remaining capital to the companies that are thriving such as Google, Potash Corporation (   POT   ), Apple and Mastercard. And If Facebook were to file an IPO I would go 'all in' at the open.
