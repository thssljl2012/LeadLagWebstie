They get nineteen other CDOs to make the same deal, $100 dollars of insurance for $6. So 20 CDOs give AIG a total of $120. AIG figures one will go under, AIG will pay out $100 and then pocket the remaining $20.     Then half of them CDOs fail. Ten guys call up AIG each asking for their $100. AIG is on the hook for a thousand dollars, but it only has $120 in the bank. AIG needs $880 in a hurry ....       Thanks for all the replies. Now, to continue the betting analogy:     Would it be fair to say, then, that here AIG have effectively been acting as the bookie? That they have been offering odds of 6-1 about an event when the true odds were more like evens, and the punters have bet heavily at 6-1 and watched their "horse" romp home ?
