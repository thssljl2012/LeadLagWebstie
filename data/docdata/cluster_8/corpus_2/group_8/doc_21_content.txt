But it turns out that one of the features of the 2005 Bankruptcy bill was to put derivative counter parties at the front of the line ahead of other creditors in bankruptcy proceedings. Actually, from what I can tell, they don't just go to the head of the line. They got to skip the line entirely. As the Financial Times noted last fall, "the 2005 changes made clear that certain derivatives and financial transactions were exempt from provisions in the bankruptcy code that freeze a failed company's assets until a court decides how to apportion them among creditors."  As the article notes, ironically, this provision which Wall Street pushed for and got to protect investment banks actually ended up hastening the collapse of Lehman and Bear Stearns last year.  Down in the article there are also the mentions of the entertainingly named "International Swaps and Derivatives Association", one of the lobbies that helped get the change in place.   Along these lines, TPM Reader GG sent in this last night ..."    Two follow up posts...   Another View    "TPM Reader SG's take on the derivatives, bankruptcy and AIG issue ...   I beg to differ with GG on two points. First, the subsidiaries of AIG are insurance companies that are by law required to have enough reserves to manage situations like this, thanks to the remnants of Glass Steagall of course.  Now, I am not an expert on insurance biz but this claim by GG seems doubtful to me.  Second, I have traded derivatives myself and know this much that the market professionals (not the amateurs who think they have info) already have enough info on what AIG owes to whom and they are benefiting immensely by this weired Geithner process.  They are getting out calmly and coolly while the rest will be left holding the bag.  So, GG's contention that if Geithner releases the names it will have this domino effect doesn't pass the smell test on any count...     ...Back to the earlier question of what the argument would be for allowing derivatives to hop to the front of the line in bankruptcy proceedings. A number of very generous readers have written in and try to explain the arguments to me, whether they agree with those arguments or not. I think I understand it. But nearly well enough that I'm going to embarrass myself by trying to explain it to you. Having said that, my takeaway from the discussing is that a lot of this has to do with further gaming the difference between derivatives and insurance. Namely, the folks working with derivatives want them to be insurance when the issue is the 'rights' insurance has in bankruptcy proceedings but not be insurance when it comes to falling under the regulatory regimes that very tightly control actual insurance."      Note to Self   http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2009/03/note_...     "When you invite insurance and derivatives experts to explain their area of specialty and critique each other's understanding of the subject matter, be ready for an afternoon with a lot of squinting and head scratching.   (ed.note: For more on this whole AIG issue, do see this Wednesday post by Barry Ritholtz. I cannot see why the policy solution he proposes at the end wasn't the obvious non-taxpayer-ripoff solution.)"    Solvent Insurer / Insolvent Insurer   http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2009/03/solvent-insurer-in...  /   "Forget the good bank/bad bank, I have an even bigger beef with this INSANE absurdity: Why are the taxpayers making good on hedge fund trades gone bad?  I cannot figure that one out.  When AIG first faltered, there were two companies jammed under one roof. One was a highly regulated, state supervised, life insurance company. In fact, the biggest such firm in the world.  The other firm was an unregulated structured finance firm, specializing in credit default swaps and other derivatives..."
