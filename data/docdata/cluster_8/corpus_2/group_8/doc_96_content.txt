You mean with all that TARP money the atms are empty        That company makes me sick to my stomach. I know a couple brokers (from Merrill) that brag about the tarp money. I feel like slapping the f'n sh@#&amp;$t out of em every time they mention it.       Just because there firm was in the top percentage they received retention bonuses to stay with the company. And I dont think these are the bonuses they are looking into... You tell me, do you think about a 30% salary increase sounds fair. These guys were on pins and needles last fall wondering if they will have a job and this is how they were rewarded to move to a new company. Yea like they could go elsewhere and make that 30%. Its not like there clients are making any money to deserve this. Total BS.      Now I'm pissed just thinking about it  Wheres my scotch
