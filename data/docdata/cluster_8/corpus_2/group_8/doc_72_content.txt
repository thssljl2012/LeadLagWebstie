First thing...insurance is legalized extortion.  Secondly, it's their financial side that is failing, not the insurance side.  I think someone needs to go through their finances for "questionable investments" because it doesn't make sense to continue bailing a company out over and over again.  Let AIG fail and let other companies buy up the assets and done.  The questionable assets will be the ones left and let the government decide to deal with those.  Throwing more money at the problem will not fix the problem.  Regulation will.
