         That's another generalization  although one that could be considered true for a large part of them .  But again, it's just another sweeping generalization to assume that it applies to everyone who has been burned by the money "bubble" that was deliberately created by the money INDUSTRY.  One size simply doesn't fit all, not matter how convenient it would be to have it so.        Hell MA, you work retail.  Don't know how long you've been at it but surely you're aware of the changes in at least just that one industry.  Not all that long ago, it was possible to make a pretty damned decent living working in a Sears store  or other retail outlet and for a hundred years and more people did so.  A lot of people took on their debt loads in a responsible manner back then based on what they were making.  And you know what happened then.  And this is only one industry.          Many people made damned good money from the information technology "bubble" and their debt load was adjusted to the money they were making BEFORE the bottom fell out.  Now we have some pretty damned high quality formerly full time tech workers selling washing machines part time for little more than minimum wage and they STILL have the same basic requirements they always had plus a shit load of debt that only GROWS each year.         You may not be old enough to remember when most of the stuff you bought in an American store was American made by American workers making American wages instead of in slave labor shops in some Indonesian jungle village or Communist China.          Those American workers adjusted their standard of living to the fact that they had good, secure jobs with a steady income.  Then some corporate hotshot realized the shareholders would make more money if they "outsourced" or "offshored" all those labor costs.  So a major portion of the manufacturing jobs went out of the country.        Skilled construction workers are the ones taking it in the shorts right now.  Here in my part of California, new building permits are down by over 50% compared to just a couple of years ago.  These people can no longer afford to live in the houses they were building not long ago but you know what?  They still have the same debt load they had when they were working full time and probably more.        Those are just a few examples.  The same type of situation is evident in just about every segment of the US work force where people have to go out and actually produce something tangible in order to scratch out a basic living.        Did you ever sit down and read and understood every paragraph in a contract when you made a major credit purchase?  If so then you're obviously the exception rather then the rule because I'm guessing that most of us wouldn't be able to make heads or tales of all that gibberish.  But if you have, can you look me in the eye and tell me that those things are written so as to provide a basic understanding by the AVERAGE purchaser of just what the hell he's getting himself into or to the contrary, are they written to OBSCURE exactly that?         Nope, there are the irresponsible ones out there, but you can't tar everyone with that brush when the banks and financial institutions in this country are doing everything they can to perpetuate the conditions that produce exactly the situations we're taling about.  Hell I'm still seeing major ads for "no load refi" and "debt consolidation" loans.  All part of that same carrot I spoke about before.          You offer a desperate man hope, and more often than not he's going to seize on it, I don't care if you're obviously Snidely Whiplash and you're tying Little Nell to the railroad track while you're negotiating with him.          I was lucky enough to come up in an era where honest hard work could get you a few of the rewards in life.  It's no longer like that for millions of us and it's going to take a while for many to give up on it.        As long as the working class hangs onto what's left of their little remnant of the "American Dream"  there will be BofAs and Citibanks and their ilk to create one fricking "bubble" after another and push as many as they possibly can right on over the edge.
