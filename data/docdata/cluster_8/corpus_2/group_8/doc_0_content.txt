         These execs,especially the AIG execs have this unwiley sense of entitlement.        Their lastest excuse is that these retreats were for agents who sell alot of their product.So let me get this straight.You want the tax payers to fund YOUR excessive bribes or incentives for agents to sell AIG insurance vs Allstate,Nationwide etc .Perhaps that's why they are in the financial straights they're in-having have to over bribe the agents to sell their product-hmmm,you quality/price cant sell it for you? ... .        What scares me is how many of these rewards and or training sessions have NOT made to the public eyes.Heard a rumor the other day AIG hotel clients have told hotel personal they are NOT from AIG,AIG is NOT here . It's like don't tell anyone .
