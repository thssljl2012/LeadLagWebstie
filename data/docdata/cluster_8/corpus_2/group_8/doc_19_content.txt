     The way I see it, Insurance industry is comparable with banking industry (structured deposit).      Banks sell risky structured deposit by feeding on greed and ignorance.   -&gt; It is good that at least MAS is doing something about this.      Insurance company sell promise for future financial coverage by feeding on fear and ignorance.   -&gt; It is about time some government agency scrutinise the dirty tricks of insurance companies (AIA saga, AIG recent problems, etc). This is a ticking time bomb.
