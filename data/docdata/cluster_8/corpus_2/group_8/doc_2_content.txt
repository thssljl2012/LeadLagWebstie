      Ekko:           Barbara Jones:           the iceman:           Barbara Jones:      Are you guys missing the fact and ignoring the fact on purpose and design or by accident because you did not read the article, that this would only apply to those that seek government bail-outs to keep from collapsing   ????         government take-overs always start small and with the best of intentions, but absolute power corrupts absolutely, until one day everything is government owned       The banks are not all government owned and this is the same procedure they are asking for on the  major insurance and holding companies like AIG ???????/          Do you think their should be no FDIC  for banks like EKKO    and Magoo and if you do could you give me a better and more detailed  scenario of what would replace the FDIC and how it would work than they have  ???????????    I do tend to agree with them on the falacies of the Federal Reserve and the problems that have come from it, I just can't seem to get a grip on what a viable alternative would be from either of them.      I thought maybe the Gold standard like Magoo pushes, but I did quite a lot of reading on that and there is just too many problems with that, which is what in part led to the acceptance of the Federal Reserve by the public in the first place.  So to go back to something that was deemed too problematic does not seem to me to be a viable alternative.         ===============    WTF?  There you go again!  Putting out a false accusations.  You have never seen a post with my name on it that even implied that!          MY apologizes Ekko,  I really thought you were against the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.  My mistake, it was not intentional, I just misunderstood somewhere along the line.    Are you saying you approve of the FDIC ????
