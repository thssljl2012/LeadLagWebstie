My understanding is there are regulations on either the internation side or the domestic side (I don't recall which) that says container ships cannot transport goods into US waters without insurance. Hence the importance of AIG to the economy.                      Well if I was pouring other peoples money into a dark pit I'd come up with stuff like this for an excuse too.      Truth is if they go out of business, tomorrow someone will start up doing that kind of insurance or you could simply sell the profitable units off.      The reason they are propped up is because they are a giant ticking derivitive bomb, ie if they go belly up, a good deal of other names we all would recognize are techinically or literally insolvent instantly, ie AIG goes the insurance backing some of these derivitives goes poof and entities all over the globe start going poof because of it.      I'll give you an example, XYZ has written option contracts that state if zzz goes belly up they owe 50 billion dollars, well zzz is looking mighty peckish but XYZ also laid off that bet to AIG as cover, but if AIG goes under XYZ is back on a extremely hot griddle..... and that is exactly what's going on.      The whole thing is a blatant ponzi scheme cover up at our expense, the truth is getting tortured to death nowdays.
