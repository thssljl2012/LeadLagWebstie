The end result of any charitable donation is that people in need receive relief.

Those of us who can least afford it will be making up for those lost contributions via our taxes.     The larger charitable contributions  - especially those associated with estates - will go elsewhere. It will be put back into the business that generated it, passed down to heirs or placed into a more tax-friendly situation. The end result is that those horrible rich people will just get richer and the poor will suffer even more.    This is the equivalent of cutting off your nose to spite your face. A really bad, bad idea.                      &#8220;Research has shown again and again that for major donors, taxes are at the bottom of their list of reasons why they make these gifts,&#8221; said Margaret Holman, a fund-raising adviser in New York. &#8220;They make these gifts because they love, are intrigued by, want to invest in their favorite charities.&#8221;       Roughly half of the high net-worth donors responding to a 2006  survey  by the Bank of America reported that they would keep giving the same amount to charity if deductions for that giving fell to zero, while about 38 percent said their giving would decrease somewhat. Only 7 percent said their gifts would fall steeply.          Eli Broad , who has made some of the biggest gifts in recent years, said through a spokeswoman that his giving would not be affected, as he has already donated far more than he can deduct."          http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/27/us...rssnyt&amp;emc=rss
