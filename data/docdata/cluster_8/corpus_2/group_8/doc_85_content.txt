     Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  cl****l                         I'm receptive to that idea, but I'd rather force companies to do business here by taxing them if they don't but still want to sell here.  I care more about middle class jobs than hungry millionaires.         Sandy Weil got a $200m bonus from Citibank and we are now bailing them out.  Rubin also got hundreds of millions over recent years.  I don't agree those numbers are tiny; we paid double for that - as shareholders and now as taxpayers.  Boards rarely represent stockholders (we saw Merrill's recent tricks of getting a bonus before BOA acquired them using tax money).        Oil prices are set by a market, so we wouldn't have real savings as buyers no matter what the executives were compensated.  I imagine thousands of people got sizeable bonuses, not just the top few.  Investors, however, get more when bonuses are lower.                      Couple things here:      1.  CEO Bonuses:  I believe CEO's should make whatever they can and as much as they possibly can.  However, no tax dollars should go to them.  The fact that the government is choosing to bail out these companies shouldn't punish good CEO's.  If a shareholder isn't happy with the CEO's bonus, they should sell the stock. The government has no business investing in horribly run banks and insurance companies, it is beyond comprehension.       2.  Would investors get more if bonuses are lower?  In some cases, yes, such as when an executive gets a huge "golden parachute" for no reason.  However, sometimes those big bonuses were EXACTLY WHY the company was doing amazing.  Generally those bonuses are given in stock options, which means the stock has done well.  (Don't think I'm saying that there are not a bunch of corporate crooks, there certainly are, but overall it's up to the prudent shareholder to decide on what to deal with it.)      3.  $200M is not lot of money.  Are you really worried about that?  We just gave TRILLIONS to the stimulus, banks, and AIG.  That is thousands upon thousands of millions.  The stories on CEO pay are distractions, making us mad at a CEO rather than the government which is spending trillions of our kids and our kid's kids money.  I'm not mad at a banker for accepting a $200M bonus, I'm mad at the government for paying it with my tax dollars.       The media loves to use wealth envy to distract us from the government's mistakes.  The government has given TRILLIONS to these banks.  For what?  They could have just re-wrote every mortgage in America for the current value and SAVED money.  It's a scam and the corporate CEOs are pawns to the government.
