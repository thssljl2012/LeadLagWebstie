And people look to them to solve the disaster they created...WOW.   Businesses come and go, the strongest survive and always will and the weak fail. Hmmm, sounds like life.  Just like the $10-15 trillion which has been redistributed (flushed) to the inner cities in the last 40 years.  We can all see how that has turned things around..   It's a freaking joke....only we're not laughing anymore.                      No reason to be sorry        Its also amazing that the previous administration which was filled with business experts also had no clue what to do. As they knew, as knows the current crowd, GM can fail, GE can fail, the Bank of America can fail....and it would be rough for many but we would survive - maybe even be stronger after the initial pain but, and this is a very big BUT, if and when the credit markets collapse its game over and hello Mad Max.       Unlike most other economies the US is 99% credit driven from the poorest consumer to the largest corporation. Without credit is like trying to live without oxygen.  Imagine if you will paying with devalued cash for electricity BEFORE the electric company sends juice to your house for the month as a simple example.
