    JohnGalt:      Chris:   Whoever said those AIG, CITIBANK, Lehman Brothers, HBOS and Barclays guys were "experts"? ;P   They went to ivy league schools so they have to be experts since they are supposed to be the best. Either that or SAT scores don't mean shit.   Or Ivy League education isn't what its made out to be...:)
