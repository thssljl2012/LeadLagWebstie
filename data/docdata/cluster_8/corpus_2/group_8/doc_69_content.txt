 Initially the real estate agents, mortgage brokers did well, as did the firms selling CDOs.  AIG did well selling "insurance".  For that matter, anyone who sold their house into the bubble did well too.        Later, whomever bet against the bubble (or really anything for that matter) did well.          Now an ex-Countrywide official is making plenty by buying distressed mortgages at 20c/$1 and restructuring them.         http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03....penny.html         People who borrowed a ton and are receiving a bailout are doing pretty well.  (for example the person in the NYT article who now has a 3% interest rate)        I'm pretty certain it can't be exactly true, but it seems like everyone is doing pretty well save those who bought for the long term and who lived within their means.
