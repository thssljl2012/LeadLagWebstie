Okay, something is wrong here.... I opened my email today to read: ~~~~~~ Merrill paid out $209 million in cash/stock bonuses in 2008 to its top 10 execs. That is $8 million more than they paid them in 2007. HELLO!!!! The year 2007 saw a TOP in the market in Oct &amp; had only two 'down' months. They pay out $201 million. The year 2008 is horrible, breaks records on how horrible that horrible really is, &amp; Merrill pays out MORE. Does anyone care anymore? This is okay for taxpayers to swallow? And, from WSJ: While Merrill staggered, 11 top executives were paid more than $10 million in cash and stock last year, say people familiar with the situation. An additional 149 received $3 million or more. The stock awards, which accounted for much of the compensation, have fallen sharply in value since they were made last year. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has subpoenaed information about Merrill's highest-paid employees in connection with his probe into $3.6 billion in bonuses paid by Merrill in the days before it was taken over by Bank of America Corp. Thus far, Bank of America hasn't turned over the names of Merrill's highest-paid executives, claiming it would help rivals woo its top talent. Oh dear... We must truly protect "wooing"... Taxpayers must understand that they are paying "woo protection". ~~~~~~February saw 697,000 job losses in the private sector according to ADP. We rally because we think the government sector rose? Or, we rally because the government hasn't said it yet? We believe them more?? HELLO! That's nearly 700,000 and folks, that's a loss in one month what the Obama Stimulus Plan will take over 3 years to get back. God forbid that more college graduates will hit the employment market over the next 3 years. ~~~~~~Increased sales of SPAM are triggering Hormel's profits higher (what does THAT say to you?). Guns and ammo are on a tear &amp; prices are going out the roof (what does THAT say to you? The big NRA Obama scare?? It's a portion but not all). Can we guess the political &amp; economic causes of these current massive profits? ~~~~~~ What exactly are the AIG massive losses? Paying guarantees on bonds globally? And, if those insurance committments are met, then whatever the bondholders or banks hold becomes "good"? That (see Elroy's post on Quanta by Li-- a perfume which later causes bubbles around the users) AIG will make good all the bad bets &amp; risk associated with Li's simplistic but unproven approach? And, are we not bailing out banks/investors outside our borders by making SURE that AIG can pay them all? Gaaaaaaaaaads! This hidden global Bailout Agenda makes me sick!!! ~~~~~~ GE falls to 18 year lows... Everyone is nervous about it... Maybe the mutual funds which can't hold stocks below $10 are bailing??? Gasp if the AAA rating on bonds loses a letter! Better yet, everything the Mutual Funds hold as of 3/31 gets published... Maybe the window dressing starts now? A window dressing ploy staged 10 days earlier than normal? ~~~~~~ January home sales were 17% down from one year earlier??? HELLO !! Most of the nation was in a friggin ice storm with NO power in January ! No lights or heat for a real estate closing?? What does the typist or the xerox copy employee use when there is no power??? ~~~~~~ Daily Reckoning says "Bailouts, handouts, bribes and giveaways threaten to sink whole industries." What's new on the THIS block ? Hmmmmmmm ... Bailouts. Bribes &amp; giveaways are normal... Bailouts aren't. We should eliminate bailouts &amp; "whole industries will rise, not sink". Is this what they meant to infer? ~~~~~~ And the Fed's Beige book came out today. They are the Master of the Obvious... and where's that Q3 uplifting turnaround? WSJ reports "The contraction in U.S. economic output deepened in the first two months of the year with no turnaround expected anytime soon, according to the Federal Reserve's latest assessment of economic conditions. Reports from the Fed's 12 regional banks "suggest that national economic conditions deteriorated further" in January through late February, the Fed said in the latest beige book. In a worrying sign, the effects of the downturn appear to have spread beyond manufacturing and financial services. Activity in a "wide range" of nonfinancial services fell noticeably amid "widespread" job cuts, the Fed said." ~~~~~~ Now then... We rally. What a world!!!
