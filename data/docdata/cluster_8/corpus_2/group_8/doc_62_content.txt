  CS: You hit it right on the head with this GE Capital. I'm now hearing that the market values this thing between 0 and minus 6 bucks. The unknown liabilities of this unit and its arguably negative value along with an overall market in complete shambles now leave us with a stock at 666. (Somebody, check the back of Immelt's neck). The problem now is that this overall deterioration is not letting up and you now hear about Citi, GM, Bank of America and one or two other Dow components being pulled off the index. The jobs numbers tommorrow are going to be horrible, housing still in big trouble, the autos begging for more cash, Obama's policies now being blamed for possibly "bankrupting the entire country", huge bailouts now somehow producing $1 stocks, Sheila Bair coming out and saying the FDIC is under serious pressure.... the whole thing is a nightmare that, instead of ending, is somehow getting worse. Projected earnings for the S&amp;P are now around 50 bucks - put a 10 or 12 multiple on that you're looking at 600 or below on that index, now at 682.    I can't even imagine how many people have followed the pundits' earlier advice and averaged down in stocks, especially dividend stocks, only to find the strategy won't work in this market and they're now permanently domiciled in the unhappy town of Tapsville.   I can't come up with any words of wisdom but 27 glasses of wine before bed will alleviate the sleeping problem! It works for me!
