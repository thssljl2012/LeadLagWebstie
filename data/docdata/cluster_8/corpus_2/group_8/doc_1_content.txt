The problem with AIG is not control, but gambling. AIG wrote insurance ("credit default swaps") on various financial instruments that it did not actually own, or have the money to pay off. The risks were "hedged" by more bets by other writers of CDS, kind of like dominoes. If AIG fails, all the dominoes fall. Something similar is behind the attempts to keep Citibank, BofA, etc. afloat--if they go bankrupt, all the holders of their bonds (and the swaps on those bonds) might go too. Which includes other banks, big institutional funds, pensions, other countries' central banks and sovereign wealth funds, etc. Or at least, that seems to be the fear. However, keeping them alive costs a lot money, and we get nothing back for it. So basically, no matter what happens, we are going to be reamed.
