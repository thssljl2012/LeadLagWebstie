       AIG lossses are primarily from mortgage insurance at the moment. So the big losses mean mortgages are defaulting. The banks are getting TARP funds(against delinquent loans), mort insurance AND the asset back to pawn off...AND...yep write offs for bad loans.   But we should feel sorry for them.
