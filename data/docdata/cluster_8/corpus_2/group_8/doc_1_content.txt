  It's still a sure bet that most of these defaults are by illegal aliens or, as Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Boxer like to refer to them, 'undocumented Americans.'      Does anyone remember when it came to light about a year ago that Bank of America had a special promo to get credit cards to illegals?  Take a wild guess at who has a hand out, looking for a bailout now.  Those 'undocumented Americans' must have maxed out their cards before packing up and moving south.  In this case, the bank  is  to blame for their own stupidity and rapacity.  In most cases, however, it was Federal government coercion to blame for risky loans.
