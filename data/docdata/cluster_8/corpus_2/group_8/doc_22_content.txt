 "Whomever the recipients are, they should be investigated for their roles in the crash and, to the extent possible, be made to pay for the bailouts."   Seems to me there's a lot of double-dipping going on.  Banks and those who insured the toxic loans are being given money to fill the gaps, but they are still looking to get that same money from people.  How far-reaching is the bailout?  Does it extend to those who are in one of these toxic loans and barely hanging on by the skin of their teeth?  If AIG is paying off on insurance claims to these banks, and this is the reason they are failing, then why the need for the US to give the banks more money on top of their insurance claim payoff?
