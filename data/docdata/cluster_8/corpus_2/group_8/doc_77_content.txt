         seems to me this should be illegal.Invest in the competitor.He has investments in citibank that we have to sell, how can you push us to sell credit hold us accountable for this, when the owner of our company holds the majority of shares in there stock. Then he has stock in hd one of our main competiters, again seems illegal to run us into the ground and invest your money in the compettion, something smells here this guy cannnot be trusted he dont give a shittttt about us as employess. We should have a national stop pa sales for about a week and se how he likes that. That would put a hurt on the bottom line for him and us but so what he is killing us. I believe and dont know why but I think on purpose.
