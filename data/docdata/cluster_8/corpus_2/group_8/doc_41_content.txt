OY, another one that wouldn't know communism (or socialism) if it bit them in the ass ... let me ask, do you write your own stuff or just repeat what the talking heads tell you to say.      Nationalization (even though no such thing has been done) is usually a temporary thing. Now that being said I completely disagree with the whole idea BUT it is no more a 'road to communism' than the man in the moon.      You people that spout this nonsensical 'communist' and 'socialist' crap just make me laugh and for one simple reason ... you use it at the exact times when it shows you have no idea what you are talking about.... you are spouting some crap you heard on the radio or TV and without taking ONE SECOND to actually look up any of the information you repeat it like a  parrot.         So let me ask you this Mr. "headed for communism" how about when GW Bush and HIS administration bought an 80% stake in AIG, the LARGEST insurance company in the world. How come you weren't screaming communism or socialism then?       Funny how that works out ... a Republican 'socializes' a MAJOR insurance company (per your definition of socialism) and we don't here peep one BUT Obama and his administration buys a 36% stake in Citigroup and all of a sudden it's COMMUNISM .... do you see how asinine that is?                      Yet another fantastic display of your "support" huh? I suppose being condescending and arrogant could be considered support in some form somewhere though right?
