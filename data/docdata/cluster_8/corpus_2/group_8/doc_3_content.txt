If they weren't allowed by law to do, the containment would've been an issue.      Now with this being allowed, at some point someone in control should've actually started controlling. That didn't happen.                      I think you mean opportunity, not greed.  Right?      But back to my original point.... if low income financing had been the only problem, things wouldn't be nearly this bad.  It was compounded immensely by insurance companies like AIG doing foolish things and banks creating and trading things out of nothing.  This in effect multiplied the problem by 3 or more.      You can blame it on the regulators if you want, but it's a pretty far stretch to then pin that on the president.                                              __________________        Jackson Slim's MySpace          Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  ChuckyB                         Then again you think the way the elephant man looks                           Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  2manband                         I was working under the assumption that banging was already underway.
