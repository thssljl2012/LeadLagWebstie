Most of these very same politicians who are borrowing our asses in oblivian, send people chirren tuh dead in unjust wars, and passing laws to control every aspect of your life, are the very same ones responsible for the mess we are in, including the head huncho Barak himself.                      Is that LIKE NOT TRUSTING MADOFF, SANFORD, the HONCHOS at AIG, MERRILL LYNCH, LEHMAN BROTHERS, FANNY MAE, FREDDY MAC, CITIBANK, etc.??
