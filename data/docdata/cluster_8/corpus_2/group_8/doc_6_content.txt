If you want to understand why there was a mortgage bubble, here's it, in a nutshell.        Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs) made up of extremely high risk subprime mortgages were bought as Triple A rated investments. Triple A is considered the highest quality, almost as good as US Treasury Bonds.  Many large institution investors, governments, college endowments, etc, etc, are permitted ONLY to invest in Triple A rated securities. WHen these garbage CDOs were rated Triple A, it opened the door for trillions of dollars to be lended out to subprime mortgage applicants. That's why just about anyone could get a loan, regardless of their creditworthiness.     For MONTHS, I wondered, "how could these garbage loans (sometimes called "toxic waste") be rated Triple A?     and here is the Answer: BECAUSE THESE CDOS WERE INSURED AGAINST DEFAULT BY AIG. And AIG was rated "Triple A"     Therefore if you have a CDO, no matter how crappy it is, and its insured by a company rated Triple A, then the CDO becomes "Triple A"     and that's why the mortgage bubbled happened, and why AIG is now bankrupt (many times over). They have no means to pay for all of the garbage they insured. We're talking TRILLIONS in garbage loans that have no chance of being paid off, backed by properties that are now worth less than the loan, with their value still falling.    If AIG is allowed to fail, and all of those "insurance" policies that it sold on this garbage debt are null and void, it will trigger a massive landslide in bankruptcy, credit downgrades, and outright collapse. Frankly, from a curiosity point of view, it would be one heck of a thing to witness.        Maybe we'll get to see it yet.
