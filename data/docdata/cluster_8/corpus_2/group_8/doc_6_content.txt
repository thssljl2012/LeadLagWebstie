 perfectly legal.  Nothing illegal, or illegitimate went on.  These people paid premiums for insurance that AIG was very unwise to sell.  But that was AIG's fault.  It's not as if these people duped AIG.  AIG was a highly sophisticated player.  So far, you have not explained what these people did wrong.  Saying "that was then and this is now" or the company changed hands still does not explain why people who simply bought what AIG was selling should not get what they bought.   That said, I have no moral problem with giving them less.  Not just the premium back, though.  They did not have the use of the money and they may have invested in something that would have been profitable, so there is a lost opportunity cost that they did incur by giving AIG the use of the money.
