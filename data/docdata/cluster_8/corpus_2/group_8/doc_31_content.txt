           Quote:           Now do you see why I think nationalization is inevitable?             Agree;  it will have to be packaged in some way to avoid using the word.  Hence the ongoing hand-wringing and lack of any specificity from the current treasurer.  Probably knows the fate but can't figure out how to package it yet.        Wonder what this means for someone like JPM who probably has enough strength to survive privately? _________________ I always wanted to be a procrastinator.
