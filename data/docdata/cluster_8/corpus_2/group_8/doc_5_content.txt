And they said that when AIG fails, so many business which cannot operate without insurance will be unable to continue, and that the results would realistically be around 40% unemployment by September . Now I'm no fan of bailouts, but neither am I a big fan of total meltdown and collapse of scenarios worse than the Great Depression, or the end of the United States as a functioning government. Take your pick? Lessor of two evils?                         That sounds about right. It would set off a domino effect, to be sure.      Plus, like I said, it would pretty much suck if they held your home insurance, and your home burned, then the next day they declared bankruptcy.      oh well.. I guess you should have done your own due diligence. You should have hired a team of auditors to check out AIG's books before you bought insurance, and even if the company was rated Triple A by Moody's you should have studied Moody's complex mathematical models to see if you could find a flaw in them.      We're a nation of personal responsibility, right?
