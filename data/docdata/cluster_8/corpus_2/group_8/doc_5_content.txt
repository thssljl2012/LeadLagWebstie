This is exactly what the gov wants.  They wrote the bailout and they knew these bonuses were coming.  They want us paying attention to these AIG execs and not them.  Where was their outrage when Franklin Raines was paid outragous bonuses for running Fannie Mae into the ground.  Plus he cooked the books to make it look like Fannie was making money just so he and other execs would get their bonuses.
