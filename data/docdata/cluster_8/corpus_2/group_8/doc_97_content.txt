My comments were directly solely towards those individuals who received a "bonus" from a company that they didn't just run into the ground, but tunnelled deep into the ground and out the other side of the planet.    I do fear that this targetted tax will somehow be spun politically in favor of conservative mouthpieces who really haven't offered any real advice on solutions for this problem in the hopes that it drags on long enough fort them to be able to use it in an election in 18 months.         AIG really has no way out of this since the bonuses were contractual.  The government owns a pretty big stake in AIG and could conceivable override them.  I think the 100% is actually a genius move on Obama's(or whoever really came up with it) part.     AIG is making money hands over fist in it's insurance dealings and that is the source of the bonuses. The problem and why it was rescued was the credit default swaps it held in Lehman brothers.   That goes back to deregulation of banking and insurance and I think everyone will agree that it was a bad idea     Greenspan wrong; credit-default traders disinfect market   Philly   10/17/2008      http://www.propublica.org/article/po...-greenspan-109
