          I'd be most interested to know what precisely you believe John Thain contributed to the shareholder value of Merrill Lynch/Bank of America, though I owned neither.   I assume they hired him and gave him a nice golden parachute contract because he had promise.  Didn't work out, though. Just goes to show how hard it is to find good managers.   Since some people on PA (presumably liberals) seem to be of a mind to liken Warren Buffet to a neanderthal, I should add that I've had shares in his company for 16 years and have no problem whtsoever with his personal financial success.    I've had money in BRK for 8 years now and just hold my nose about Buffett's liberal opinions.  I haven't seen any bad mouthing of Buffett from liberals, but if there is then I'd assume that it's because he's been critical of The One's agenda of late.
