         Is allowing AIG to sell hundreds of billions of investment-insurance to banks around the world regulation?  Is allowing wall street to package sub prime mortages into securities and sell them to banks, pension funds, and other institutions all over the world regulation?  ***  The Obama administration so far is the OPPOSITE of socialist.  In socialism, going concerns are owned by the government for the good of the poorest among us.  Obama, so far, is trying to preserve existing institutions instead of sweeping them aside so new ones can take their place, with the biggest benefit going to the class of capitalists who brought us this crap.    I am crossing my fingers and hoping that what is going on now is the dishonest prelude to allow preparation for walking in to these banks one friday afternoon and taking them over.  THAT is capitalism.  No government bailouts: if you need government money to close the loop, the government owns you (and sells you off once the crap you created is peeled off the walls.)
