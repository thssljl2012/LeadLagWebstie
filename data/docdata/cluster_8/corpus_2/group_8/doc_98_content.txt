         Ask yourself these questions. Why has Congress GIVEN away its power to regulate our money to Paulson and the fed? Why won't any elected official, or the media talk about the elite bankers who have caused this current situation? Who wrote that 500 page bill that was passed less than a week after the 3 page document sent from the whitehouse, requesting 700 billion dollars from taxpayers? Why was bank of America involved in the Fredie/Fannie bailout, or did they write it? Why are the G7 and g20 dictating policy to the USA? These bankers won't fix the problems to "Help Us" or "protect us" These are the very SAME bankers and officials who let the current situation develop. By the time they are done with this current staged magical play, the American People will demand entry into the new world order to save us. What Constitution. Come on Folks, Read and understand. The "net" is a great teacher. The timer started in 1913 is is running out.
