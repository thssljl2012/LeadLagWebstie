But that would mean the Breaking apart and Selling off of the Individual Insurance area's of AIG, which means they would EACH have to display their books and accounting slips to the investors... and when that happens, no one will pickup the pieces.  Yes, that aspect of AIG will turn a Profit.  However, the part of AIG that really ***** them was Insuring of Banks and Corporations based through underwriting.  They NEVER truely estimated the Premium vs Risk of those investments.  They NEVER read through the securities, or the Risk of those Insurances to ever be repaid (and thus they would never turn a Profit, and lead to the Liquidity of Assets).  So they will never split the company, due to the exposure of their horrible investments would be made public due to the sale/split of the Company.  Of Course, that may be why the Fed continually bails them out, it would expose the Fed for what it really is also.
