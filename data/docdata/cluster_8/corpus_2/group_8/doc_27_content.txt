         From a local TV station's site:  (Apologies for the commercials)        I'm beginning to doubt seriously the ability of the current, or for that matter ANY, administration to get ANYTHING we might consider a normal function of government done.       Lawmakers Outraged Over Passport Fiasco         Just one more example of them being unable to do the things we'd normally expect them to do while going full bore on those we'd rather they wouldn't.                     Quote:              "We had a huge miscalculation of the size of the surge." Who's miscalculation? "I take responsibility sir, we did our best  based on a company that is well known"                 More of their damned "The Private Sector Can Do It Better And Cheaper" privatization BS?  Can anyone cite a single of example of privatization  actually having saved the taxpayer a damned dime so far?        To add insult to injury, look who the freaking contractor they "privatized" it to  just happens to be:                 Quote:              But for some Senators like Florida's Bill Nelson, the time for excuses is over. Nelson wants to know why in the midst of preparing for the uptick in applications the State Department switched contractors, to   Citibank  , to help process passport applications.                Can you believe it?  Our own Eddie is making money from government ineptness these days.  Who woulda thought it?
