And their insurance can't make up the difference. Would that be a fair assessment?       If so, would it also be fair to say that the original vendors of those properties (whether individuals or institutions) have shown a total 'profit' equal to the 'loss' now being suffered by the mortgage providers*? That is, no money has gone missing (as it were), just that the money has become  diffuse  rather than concentrated in the hands of major institutions. Expressing it in terms of a  really  big poker game, there have been many small winners but a few gigantic losers?       * I use this term loosely, realising that these debts have been bundled, traded and who knows what-all.       Only in a few cases. If someone sold their house at the peak of the bubble and didn't immediately buy another house, they made a profit, but those cases are few and far between. Most homeowners actually have equity in their house and that has simply disappeared. When assets lose market value, nobody gets the difference. It just evaporates into thin air.
