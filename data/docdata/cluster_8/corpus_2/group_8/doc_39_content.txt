                        Quote:           Mamacalled                                           Let's see, should wwe go after the Welfare people who receive government money when they buy beer? Playstations? T.V.s? cable? All of these are luxuries that government handouts should not be used for. Is Barney Frank raising Caine over this?  O.K. for you all that received Grants or student loans. Should the government regulate how you spend that money received? Again, these are government handouts.  As for AIG, there are several divisions that are making money. Should the execs of these divisions not get bonses for makiing a profit? Not all of the bonuses have gone to divisions losing money.                                                     How about we go after both? And as far as student loans being government handouts--you've got to be kidding. I'm still repaying my wife's student loans.
