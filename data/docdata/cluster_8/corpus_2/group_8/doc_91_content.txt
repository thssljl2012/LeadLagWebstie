I think the answer lies in the bank I choose. next Monday I will begin searching for a small town banks that have no ties to the sub-prime lending crisis and have good balance statements. May take a while but I'm not sticking with Bank of America any longer. The reason I have cash in my savings is that I have fully withdrawn from Wall Street.
