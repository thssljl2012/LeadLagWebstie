Nothing but dissapointed so far.      It's not like this whole financial crisis crept up on him. This whole coming up with ideas as you go strategy is bullshit.                                  Quote:                         clinton is largely responsible for what is happening today but everyone wants to slam bush...he got rid of a lot of the preventions that were put in place during the great depression such as the glass-steagall act...The repeal enabled commercial lenders such as Citigroup, which was in 1999 then the largest U.S. bank by assets, to underwrite and trade instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations and establish so-called structured investment vehicles, or SIVs, that bought those securities...obama is on the path to fucking up majorly...he will be this generations Jimmmy Carter                       Nevermind that repealing Glass-Steagall was Phil Gramm's brainchild and voting was on party lines...it passed along with a Republican majority.          To be honest the only people I see saying things would be fixed by now are, to a man, all Republicans. I don't expect real improvement til we get numbers in Q1/2010.
