      Anyone listen to Bernanke this morning???  He is PIZZED OFF at AIG!    They exploited a regulatory loophole to sell &#036; trillions in insurance that exposed them to &#036;100s billions of losses, with NO assets to actually cover those losses should they happen.  See, back in the day insurance companies would sell lots of life and casualtiy insurance, and not have the assets to actually pay should something go wrong....   so we created laws requiring them to have large reserves of assets to actually PAY the claims when they come in.  With Greenspan's new financial inovations and the regulatory  "out to lunch" policies of Bush's SEC, insurance companies were allowed to sell unlimited amounts of financial asset insurance, with NO assets to actually cover any losses.  Now, the U.S. Taxpayer has to pay all the losses, or the banks, brokerages, pension funds, insurance companies, governments, etc. that bought those policies, all dissappear into a giant black hole we used to call the economy.     And, he was pretty tactful, but the message was clear.  We HAVE to do something about the structural deficit (read military spending and entitlements like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid...).
