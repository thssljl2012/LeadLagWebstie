If someone achieves money from you, based on a story with lies (the bad mortgages in the package) , we call that fraud.                      Funny you brought this up.  My father (and 10,000 other folks) fell into this same situation about 18 years ago here in Florida by a company named "General Development."  To make a long story short the courts ruled in favor of the people and folks were allowed to walk out of their homes.  They lost big time.  The owners and executives went to jail for 18 months.  But guess what....?   Once they left jail they opened up shop in Miami under a new business name and are back in business today.
