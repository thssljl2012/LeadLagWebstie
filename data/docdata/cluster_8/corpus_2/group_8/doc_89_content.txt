 "you needed my money...i gave it to you...i will have some say into how my money gets used....you don't want to do it that way?...give me my money back?"  the whole AIG 'contract' situation keeps getting looked at through tight prisms....the simple truth is that AIG would be paying nothing, no insurance, no bonuses, no anything, had they not received US taxpayers' money...there are no contracts that cannot be 'revised' (ask UAW)...and no 'agreements' involving taxpayer money that should be exempt from any action related to the monies...maybe we should take back all of the money from AIG, let them pay out whatever they want, however they can...and then give them the 'loan'...hell, we are going to get screwed either way...
