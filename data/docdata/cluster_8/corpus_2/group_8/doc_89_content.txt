A novel idea - pay them millions to come up with insurance products they didn't understand, then pay them millions to come up with a fix that hasn't been determined yet.      Without AIG's insurance, derivative products couldn't have grown anywhere near as big as they did and this mess would simply not exist or at least wouldn't be the same magnitude.      AIG didn't understand the risk (no one did) and were compensated for complete failure.  Hard to justify that.
