 i heard something about AIG that's kinda fascinating in a sick financial way.    the govt's already given 'em tens of billions and it's far from over...    turns out though that a LOT of the insurance provided by AIG is in ASIA and they were panic stricken that AIG could fail, and i bet the u.s. govt had little problem convincing asian govts to loan money to the u.s. to bail out AIG.  oh what a tangled web...
