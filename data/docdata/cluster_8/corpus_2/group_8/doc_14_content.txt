         If this paper was submitted by AIG, isn't that what they could be expected to say - that the entire insurance industry could fail if AIG wasn't bailed out again?  Just thinking.  I can't imagine them saying "well, there are gonna be a bunch of people unemployed, and there will be a few lawsuits, and maybe some stadium will need to be re-named, but we'll get over it and in a year or two things will be pretty much OK except maybe in California, and Jon Stewart will be making jokes about our boss going to jail."  But for all I know they might be right.  I don't know enough about this stuff.  Back to lurking.
