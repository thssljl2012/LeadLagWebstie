    yeah it's all our fault... while we learn 350 people sitting at the AIG office in England sold 370 billion in insurance policies with zero collateral to back the policies. Meanwhile these 350 people consumed 30 billion dollars in earnings over the last 5 years..  and when real estate collapsed, the policies were no good.. till we the taxpayers ponied up for them,  our fault ?       And this is what caused the AIG collapse..                    Mike Mentzer for US Senate, Pa.
