 We will all remember who stood by us, treated us with respect, and who screwed us sideways.   Our business worked with Wachovia, Citi, AMX and Bank of America regarding various corporate credit products.  Oddly enough, BOA is the only one that shot straight with us. They have even stepped in when the others got out of hand.  This businesses credit rating was top tier and still is. In spite of the drop in business we have been able to reorganize and remain profitable at a lower margin.   AMX is hurting small business so bad it's unbelievable. If they end up relegated to the history books when this is all over then I would not shed a single tear.
