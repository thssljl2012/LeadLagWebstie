The FDIC, the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation, is the insurance that can protect your local bank deposit in the face of a bank failure. This pool of emergency money is funded entirely by the banks of this nation. The fund has been so heavilly drained (by recent events) that the folks at the FDIC did some fresh calculating and decided they need to increase the amount of the fees that each US bank needs to cough up every year to keep the fund afloat. But now the banks are whining.     Yes, you read that correctly: it's the banks who are whining over being charged fees.      And yet at the same time, I can understand the SMALL banks resenting the fees. The article goes on to say that in light of these protests the FDIC is now contemplating shifting the burden of these fees mostly to larger banks.       http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?p...d=alsJZqIFuN3k                       From the article:       Quote:                         Smaller banks are ouSmaller banks are outraged over the one-time fee, which could wipe out 50 percent to 100 percent of a banks 2009 earnings, Camden Fine, president of the Independent Community Bankers of America, said yesterday in a telephone interview.                     Okay, I don't quite understand - does each bank pay a fixed amount to be part of the FDIC? I'd think their fees would be based on the total covered deposits they have (similar to an insurance policy, which is what it is, isn't it?), so larger banks would pay proportionally more.

Aren't we right back at the Great Depression?                      Yes, possibly. There could be runs on many banks as people withdraw money and put it in mattresses and who-knows-where, and a lot of banks could collapse. I don't know that that in itself would trigger something like the Great Depression, except that the economy is the weakest it's been in many years.    But I really don't believe that (the FDIC going under, though it may well run out of funds and get bailed out/get funds from elsewhere) would happen. Again from the article:       Quote:                         The deposit insurance fund wont dry up because the government can get funds from the industry and  congressional appropriations , and  borrow from the Treasury , Chip MacDonald, a partner specializing in financial services at law firm Jones Day, said today in a telephone interview.                     (bold mine)  Dozens more banks may fail, but to not have insured deposits would cause a LOT more banks to fail, and they're not going to allow that.

Weren't they also used in the US? Surely several of them still exist in museums.    Is there some specific use you're thinking of for it?
