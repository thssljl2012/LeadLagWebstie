JustStartin,    You have given people all of seven minutes to answer that - play nicely.     http://www.igmarkets.co.uk/     I would suggest checking out the front page here and keeping an eye on the DOW futures. If they swing up, this will reflect in the sp, if they start to drop away, this should also impact the sp.    Also worth keeping an eye on Citi and Bank of America following the open. What befalls the yank banks (as it were) will have some impact over here as well.    With these actions you should be able to form some sort of idea.    Cheers,    SM
