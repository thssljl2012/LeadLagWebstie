If anything, since this uptick was based on information that Citibank posted a first quarter gross profit before adjustments, it's something like a small shaft of light in the middle of a dark night. Very small.      However, if it continues to burn bright and other bailed out banks start to show similar improvements, it will be an indicator that the bailouts probably prevented a major calamity in the financial markets.      And yes, you would need to give initial thanks for this to Paulson and Bush since they started that ball rolling. Then you would need to also give thanks to Obama for continuing the same general policies.      But, either way, one report, and one day's worth of gains mean nothing for the long term. Way to early to get either the party hats or the firing squads out.
