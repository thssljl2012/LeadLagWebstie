 Whenever I post about walking away from debt, several people like to jump on their soapbox and tell the tale of how they lived life responsibly, bought a home they could afford, make the minumum payments on their credit cards every month and so on.     That's all fine and dandy, however, you should know that it is mathematically impossible to pay-off all the debt that currently exists in our economy. It is never, ever going to get paid off.     This idea that everyone "needs to pay what they owe" is akin to telling the passengers on the Titanic to all grab their coffee cups and run below to start scooping water out of the ship to keep it afloat. Their desperate efforts would have made no difference to the fate of the ship. The water was filling the ship too fast, and eventually sucked it into the abyss.    However, let me say that the banks and credit card companies very much appreciate your noble and honorable thinking. Their goal is to keep you and everyone else in this country in debt peonage, slaving away the rest of your feeble years to pay interest on debt. That's how they make money, you see?     And they also appreciate you pointing fingers and blaming your neighbors. This suits them just fine, because then Bank of America, for example, doesn't have to reveal how much it paid executives in bonuses.    Bloomberg.com: U.S.     So ZugZub, Suzie02, and others like you, on behalf of Citibank, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and AIG, I want to thank you for your loyalty, your honesty, your patronage.
