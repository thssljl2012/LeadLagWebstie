My home loan is from Fannie Mae so in effect it is from the US government and you still have no right to the details of my finances.    And I can guarantee there was not any clause giving the public the right to see the details of employee compensation by a company that BOA had no control of.  The situation is regarding bonuses paid before BOA owned ML.     BOA has agreed to cooperate with regulators but is simply trying to protect the rights of the workers that are now their employees.                      Yes I know..it was basically a blank check to the banks.
