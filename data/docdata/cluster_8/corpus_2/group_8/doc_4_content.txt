AIG is being bailed out because they have trillions in credit default swaps on their books. If they fail, the reference entities on the CDS will fall too (Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, BNY, Wells Fargo, Wachovia, etc). A huge domino effect of collapse is what the govt is trying to prevent with the constant donations to AIG.
