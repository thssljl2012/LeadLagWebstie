Well......    Futures just sold off sharply with volume. Europe did a 180 and is pretty much down about 1% across the board.    What do I think we see?    Morning rally, selling into the rally, flat to +/- 100 points today. Nothing big. Volume weak.  Great panic setting in because of insurance companies as everyone finally figures out:    "If AIG was full of crap, who else lied?"    Duh.    Almost everybody lied.     When Sparky the Spark Plug Brokerage firm figures out what a bunch of keyboard warriors like us did over two years ago they will sell the dog piss out of this market and the baby boomers will get to retire in 2021.    At age 94.
