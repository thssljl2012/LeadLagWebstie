You're close.       The reason AIG is being saved no matter what is the fact that it's the company that insured the entire (almost) banking industry. Every banking loss, every investment loss was insured by AIG.         AIG is paying billions to it's clients for the policies that they wrote.. If AIG fails, so does every single account/bank/holder/investor that holds an AIG policy.       AIG was a totally fucked up idea that basically tried to insure against a recession. Which as everyone on earth knows is impossible.       It's so totally f'd up it staggers the mind.
