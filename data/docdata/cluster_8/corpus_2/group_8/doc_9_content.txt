    Stunned or destroyed?  UnReal UhO-Bama has just cut the CitiBank Preferred dividend payouts--- are these guys at the FED really that clueless --this literally wipes out anybodies incentives to buy any Type of Bank now or ever again  imho....   not to mention another spiral of mark to markets writeoffs everywhere.... Hey DCee tell UhO-Bama that  millions of shareholders were once taxpayers too - but who has any income to tax anymore duh does'nt Washington know that Middle America was the biggest shareholder of Banks, Financials, et al thru their Pensions &amp; Mutual Funds that have virtually been destroyed now.... so much for 55% of US Households now that UhO-Bama's Wealth Transfer has nuttin'2transfer anymore...
