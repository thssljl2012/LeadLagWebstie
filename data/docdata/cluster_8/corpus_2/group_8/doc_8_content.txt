  I guess it is an issue for other banks too.      I did not see an article about US Bank/Northern Trust but I did see this:       http://www.jsonline.com/business/40793652.html  Johnson Bank is a local Business Bank probably pretty conservative.      I also know a local regional bank we deal with for business issues was recently rumbling about returning their TARP money. They said it is expensive $$ to begin with and then if the Gov't is going to tell you how to run your business, it may not be worth it. They too are considered to be stronger than most banks and probably would not be in trouble w/o the $$.
