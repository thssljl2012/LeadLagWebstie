It would start a huge cascade of bankruptcies that would hit every major American bank.      The day that AIG declares bankruptcy will be the day the depression begins.  Maybe it will happen anyway, but shouldn't we at least try to prevent it?                        OK, this is very helpful.  This is the first time I have ever seen any explanation of what it means to be too big to fail.  DJTJ (or someone else in the know), would you care to expound on this and discuss other ramifications for the kind of crisis we would be looking at if AIG failed?  Also, what other companies are out there that this is applicable for?
