 Thread, here's a try. The massive debt gets written down and sold off. The derivatives are worthless, so their true value is zero. The United States gets out of the world policeman business. AIG goes into bankruptcy where it belongs; its sound insurance business gets sold, and its thimblerigging derivatives get dumped. GM goes into Chapter 11. So does Citibank; its depositors get FDIC'd, and those over the limit take their chances. Fanne/Freddie and the whole crooked mortgage business gets put on a sound bases, Community Reinvestment Act gets repealed, and the banks go back to being banks, not socialist experiments. Stimulus money goes to producing jobs, not political payoffs. Outsourcing gets taxed 100%. The military guards our borders, not Afghanistan's or South Korea's or Israel's or anybody else's. And we stop spending m oney we don't have. Failing which, the US goes bankrupt. How'm I doing?
