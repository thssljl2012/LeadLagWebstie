 Look, I don't think society is going to collapse or anything like that.         Whether or not GM survives as a corporate entity, people are going to drive cars, so someone will build and sell them.         Whether or not Bank of America or Citi survive as corporate entities, there will still be banking.         The issue for individuals is that as these issues work themselves out there will be collateral damage.         Most of our short-term debate, the way I see it, is how to protect ourselves as individuals and how to protect society at-large from the collateral damage.         The good thing, the way I see it, is that we will do a lot of self-examination and look at the way we've been doing things to see if there's a better path.
