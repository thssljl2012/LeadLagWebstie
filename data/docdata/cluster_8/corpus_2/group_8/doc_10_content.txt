 I have heard that AIG is an important company to the infrastructure of the United States. They are the primary insurance company to the incoming cargo ships that import goods into the country. My understanding is there are regulations on either the internation side or the domestic side (I don't recall which) that says container ships cannot transport goods into US waters without insurance. Hence the importance of AIG to the  economy .
