Nasty things (like disappearing) happened to people who opposed Hitler or were seen as being less than "patriotic" by not co-operating. Opel, along with every other German automaker had absolutely no choice in the matter.      Do you also dislike everything from Japan, Italy, Hungary, Romania, Finland, Bulgaria and Thailand? They were all allied with the Nazis during WW2.      You are right about "no clean hands" though. For example, Swiss bankers used their neutral status to become (even more) rich from both sides. Come to think of it, they were just as greedy as Citi, Bank of America etc are today.                      I have no particular affinity for products from any country nor specific disdain for any of those you mentioned.       The complicity of many international corporations with the Nazis during the war years is no secret. When it was over and done with, Ford, GM etc. all pretty much claimed they lost control of their German-based divisions and distanced themselves from responsibility for any evil deeds committed.       However, the hypocrisy is they weren't nearly so diligent to distance themselves from any profits made during the course of business-as-unusual.       Your point about some companies having little to say in the running of their factories during the Nazi era is certainly valid. In fairness to those so affected, I believe some companies with a conscience attempted to make some sort of amends with victims after the war  if GM or its Opel division were among those, I'd like to see them get fair acknowledgement. However, given that they sought compensation for damages to their factories from Allied bombing makes me think their hearts just weren't into it.      Given all of this, the original point I was trying to make was that getting weepy &amp; sentimental over losing Opel is misplaced affection  the fond memories and nostalgia just arent there.
