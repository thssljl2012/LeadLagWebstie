At least they should be honest about this bailout and tell everyone that company XYZ (likely GS and a few others) at one point made a boatload of money by taking took too much risk because they relied on insurance from AIG without checking if AIG had the financial resources to pay the claims. Now it's a falling apart and we need to protect company XYZ by bailing out AIG with tax payer money. Since we are really bailing out company XYZ (rather than AIG) we are getting some equity in co XYZ and the bond holders are getting a haircut and executives face compensation restrictions etc.   INstead they say we are bailing out AIG due to systemic risk and we don't get sh-t from the true beneficiaries of this bailout. They don't even need to face public exposure but the public thinks that we're bailing out AIG while company XYZ is run by brilliant people who did not get caught up this mess. Company XYZ even gets to sit in hearings and brag how they are hedged when those hedges are only helping because the tax payers backstopped them.    It's disgusting.         thread start
