The problem with your analysis is that you attribute the wrong motive to the bailout of companies like AIG.  This is not being done out of any sense of compassion.  And in the opening paragraph you do seem to recognize that money is going to AIG for reasons other than keeping than the benefit of AIG shareholders and employees.  I feel on pretty safe ground to say that the ability of AIG to operate as an ongoing enterprise is the least of the government's concerns.  Rather it's to back up the transactions into which AIG has entered, and incurred a substantial obligation.  It's no different than what might happen if a city burned down, the main insurance company cannot meet its obligations, and the government agrees to honour the homeowners' fire insurance policies with that company.  The welfare of the insurance company is not the concern, it's the welfare of the policy owners.     AIG's customers are depending on the financial insurance sold to them to keep themselves solvent.  Many of them hold bonds and other securities that have gone down in value, and the insurance sold to them by AIG is propping up those securities.  If that financial insurance was not backed up by the government there would be a terrible domino effect in the economy.  I agree with you that there is moral hazard associated with propping up these financial companies, but unfortunately there really isn't any choice.  Bernanke spoke specifically about the problem with AIG yesterday and of these dangers in no uncertain terms.
