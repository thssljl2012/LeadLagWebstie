Bill,  love the show, been a fan for years.      When do you and your panel think we'll finally hit bottom and begin to recover?          The executives of Merrill Lynch should have to give their bonuses back and they should all be locked up.  The Bank of America executive that signed off on the bonuses should go with them to jail.      Why are we paying under $50/barrel of oil and gas is still $2.00/gal?   When we were paying over $130.00/barrel gas was $4.00.  The ratio is out of whack and Exxon is still making a fortune.      --   Edited by chatycathy at 03/06/2009 3:23 PM PST
