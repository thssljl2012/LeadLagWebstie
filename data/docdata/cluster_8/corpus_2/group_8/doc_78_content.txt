What good will hundreds of thousands of Sears charge accounts be if there are no Sears stores for the people to use them in?  I guess the greed of some people is truely unexcusable!  Although they may aquire great wealth at the expense of others, one day they will have to explain thier actions to God!  Then they will shown the door...                The LAST thing these people believe is that that they will ever have to answer to any entity for anything they do.  And while you may take comfort in the idea that they will have to face their maker with all this on whatever they possess that passes for a conscience, there is nothing that will deter them in this lifetime.          When that time comes they'll simply call for a company supplied limo to take them to the pearly gates and if they can't get in, they'll start buying up stock and organizing a takeover.  And even when that doesn't work none of their victims will be around to see what happens then.        I'm not making fun of your beliefs but only trying to illustrate the mindset you're dealing with.  These people simply do not care.  Their only consideration is who is the biggest, baddest SOB in their little club and the only way they have to measure their status in that regard is by the number of bucks they control.  The idea that they can't buy their way into heaven will simply never enter their mind because they simply don't look that far ahead.          They've reached the point where the only way they can make the bucks they need to knock off Warren Buffet or Bill Gates is to impoverish the other 95% of the population of this country and they've set about doing so with no compunction, no concern and certainly no guilt involved.  They simply buy or take what they need to to do so, including the company you work for, the house you live in and the politicians you thought were there to protect and serve you.         As long as they can keep you fragmented and separated, they have no meaningful opposition.  They own the sources of employment, the institutions that supposedly govern and regulate those sources and probably worst of all, the media that could be spreading the word to all of the "little people" but instead hides its head in the sand and gives us mawkish drivel about how good we have it as long as we all have cell phones and microwaves.        Virtually everything you read here and on the other forums is a part, however small, of the overall picture you need to understand what is happening and why.  Somone's rant about delivery may be the piece that completes a picture of the manipulation of logistics and store stock designed to bring about a certain result that may affect you drastically while making another buck for the hedge fund.
