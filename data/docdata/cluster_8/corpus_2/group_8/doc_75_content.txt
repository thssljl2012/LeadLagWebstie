He is definitely leaning more towards european, canadian, and australian type "socialism", if you want to call it that.      Andrew                      Your government has controled the main bank of America ---- National City Bank of New York .That's the bank has been nationalized.   In the future, more and more America private enterprises will be nationalized.   A great America soviet is coming.    It's a great threat for freedom of America.
