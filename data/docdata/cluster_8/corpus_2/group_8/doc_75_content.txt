 FNM Message Board Posts          Recs: 1              The Economy Needs Coordination, Not Money, From the Government.     Last week, the market sent out another enormous vote of no-confidence in the notion that even nearly two trillion of government bailout money would materially ease the ongoing financial crisis. While the idea of mortgage principal reductions were part of the plan announced by the Obama administration, the idea of government having a major role in subsidizing this was predictably and correctly met with contempt (watch    Rick Santelli of CNBC   , for example).      The key issue is that in the final years of the housing bubble, home prices advanced more than 30% above their normal relationship with incomes. Unless we want the government to redistribute about 30% of the value of the U.S. housing stock either directly to struggling homeowners or indirectly to financial institutions, this problem will simply not be solved by government money.        What is needed is not government money, but government  coordination.  Government has the capacity to take actions in a large, coordinated way that private individuals cannot. Importantly, these actions need not involve enormous deficits or costs to taxpayers.        For example, throwing government money at financial institutions that are insolvent simply gives taxpayers a loss that  should be borne by the bondholders  of that financial institution. I can't stress emphatically enough that the largest bank failure in U.S. history  Washington Mutual  was arranged last year with absolutely NO cost to the government, and no loss to the bank's customers. What happened there was exactly what I've been advocating since the Bear Stearns crisis: the government took Wa-Mu into receivership, wiped out the stockholders and most of the bondholders,  sold the bank's assets along with the customer liabilities  to J.P. Morgan for $1.9 billion, and handed those proceeds over as partial recovery for the senior bondholders. For more details on this sort of transaction, see the March 31, 2008 comment    What Congress should Understand About the Bear Stearns Deal   , and the September 22, 2008 comment,    An Open Letter to Congress Regarding the Current Financial Crisis   .     Take a look at Citibank's balance sheet as of the third quarter of 2008. The company had about $2 trillion in assets, versus about $132 billion in shareholder equity, for a gross leverage ratio of about 16-to-1. That's not a comfortable figure, because it indicates that a decline of about 6% in those assets would wipe out Citibank's equity and make the bank technically insolvent. Unfortunately, we saw credit default spreads screaming higher last week, while the bank's stock dropped below $2 a share, so evidently the market is deeply concerned about the possible immediacy of that outcome.     But keep looking at the liability side of Citibank's balance sheet. There is over $360 billion in long-term debt to the company's bondholders, and another $200 billion in shorter term borrowings. None of that is customer money. That puts the total capital available to absorb losses at $132 + $360 + $200 = $692 billion, which is about 35% of the $2 trillion in assets carried by Citibank.        That's a  huge  cushion for customers, who are unlikely to lose even if Citibank becomes insolvent. Should that occur, the proper response of government will not be to defend Citi's bondholders at taxpayer expense, but rather, to take Citi into receivership, wipe out the shareholders and most of the bondholders, and sell the assets along with the liabilities to customers to another institution.     Alternatively, the government could hold those assets in receivership, reappoint management in the interim, and eventually IPO the company - now stripped of debt obligations - as a new entity called, say, Citigroup. The proceeds of the issuance would be retained as statutory capital, and a small amount might be paid as a residual to the existing bondholders. That sort  temporary  "receivership" is the only sense in which the government response could be called nationalization."       Simply put, institutions that are insolvent and would only avoid continued insolvency by large and continued infusions of taxpayer funds should be allowed to fail through the process of government receivership. It is wrong to squander the taxes of ordinary citizens and put a burden of indebtedness on our children  in order to protect the bondholders  of careless and poorly-managed financial institutions.           The other pressing need for government coordination is to address the foreclosure crisis. What policy-makers do not seem to understand is that    the only appropriate way to restructure mortgages is to change the payment stream in a way that doesn't dramatically reduce its present value, and doesn't give away something for nothing.          If you simply let bankruptcy judges push down principal values with no other recourse to lenders, you undermine the basic principles of contract law that underpin our economy. If you provide government funds to reduce the mortgage principal of some homeowners, with nothing for those who have played by the rules, you create huge inequities and incentives for good homeowners to go delinquent.
