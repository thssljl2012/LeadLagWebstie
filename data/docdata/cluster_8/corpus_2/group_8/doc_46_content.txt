In Summary we need a real leader who is truly in the middle and not to vast extremes.                      After I posted this, I was listening to Tom Sullivan, a radio show about economics.  He said a growing number of economists were getting vocal that the gov't and treasury are not only not doing the right thing, but are doing the wrong things.  Today Obama's policy is causing "wealth destruction and banking destruction"  and are "destroying billions and billions of investor wealth."      He said one of the best minds, a guy named Dick Bove  says gov't is panicing.  And that the markets are "saying these policies are not working" And Geithner continues to destroy banks with wrong ideas.  And Geithner was the tax cheat that we had to forgive as he was the only one that can save us at his nomination for treasury.  Remember?      The US has 11 trillion dollars in outstanding mortages, half in fannie and freddie and half issued by other financial institutions.  Obama has only address the freddie or fannie half of the mortgages ONLY.        Today the problem is Obama's Geithner has taken over Citigroup and "confiscated private ownership" (sullivan) AND told them they could not make any more interest payments.  So all the financial institutions that have  retirement accounts in citigroup have to pull them and sell as they are required by law to invest in vehicles that spin off income, (if income account) to make monthly payments to retired people.  And per Dick Bove on Fox News today, Obama's policy to do this to retirement accounts have "lost 10's of millions of dollars today" because of Obama's policy.      Tom Sullivan said "Geithner is pouring gas on the fire." with citigroup as "citigroup has decent cash flow so there was no need to do this".  And "gov't  completely messed up citibank."  Obama and his policies are causing the markets to drop.      And causing problems for banks where investors fear they will do the same with them.  And AGI gave the gov't Am Life Co and Am something Assurance co as they can't sell them for any money.  So now the gov't owns life insurance companies.        To sum it up, Tom Sullivan said "The markets are clearly screaming we do not like the plans coming out.  We do not think they will work."
