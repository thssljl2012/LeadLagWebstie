 Edited on Fri Mar-06-09 05:10 AM by pa28         During this 8 year experiment with market fundamentalism (epic failure) we gave full authority for allocation of capital to the very financial institutions needing bailout today.  Prepare yourself for shock; they allocated all the capital to . . . themselves!  Bank of America, what's left of Merrill Lynch or John Thain will not want to be the sin eaters for history's biggest equity stripping operation. So naturally they want to hide.
