                     Barclaycard                                      I too have been unable to log on to Barclaycard for the last week. I have contacted them by phone on three occassions, the last time a nice lady from India hung up on me! I have also reported this to the ombudsman. Also I have been in touch with Barclays to complain and they have given me a complaint number. Although they say Barclaycard is a separate company it still comes under the Barclays group. At least complaining to Barclays you can contact them on a 0800 number, the Barclaycard number they are making profit from 0844
