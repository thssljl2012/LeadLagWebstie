AIG should not be bailed out. Their strength was insurance and they had no business getting into the mortgage side without proper management. They still have enough capital from the insurance side. Even if they fold and people are worried about insolvency, there are pools that each licensed and admitted insurance company pays to make up for the claims. I am unfortunately forced to work with some branches of AIG and for the most part, they suck. The service is horrible unless you have the rare occasion to find a niche market with a smart underwriter
