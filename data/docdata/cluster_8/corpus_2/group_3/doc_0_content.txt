  Take a breath and calm down Snowman - we don&amp;#039;t want you to get all hot and bothered and then melt on us!   Picks? Ok - HDIX. It will hover between $6-$10 until it rockets to $30, at least.   Want to profit from AIG? I have people around me that have a combined profit of over $100,000 from AIG in the past week. If it goes below $2.00 again, jump.   Nationwide, Nationwide, Nationwide. Same insurance products as AIG, no mortgage implosion or moronic handling of money. Stands to make a great deal of money as it buys huge, well underwrittenassets from AIG at pennies on the dollar.   There&amp;#039;s three for you. Now, will someone please tell me about Oasis and Mirage?
