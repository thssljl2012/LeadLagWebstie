 Edited on Mon Oct-06-08 09:11 PM by anigbrowl         You photoshop Dick Fuld into a death star uniform, fine, that&amp;#039;s political commentary. You put a Barclay&amp;#039;s logo on top, it implies he&amp;#039;s working for Barclays. What else could it possibly imply - that he works for CitiBank? Get real.  For reference, here&amp;#039;s what I said about it at the outset (emphasis added): &amp;quot;Fuld isn&amp;#039;t employed by Barclays.  In case of confusion , that&amp;#039;s a Barclay&amp;#039;s Bank logo you have on him and all the stormtroopers, but it&amp;#039;s entirely inappropriate since he&amp;#039;s not on their payroll.&amp;quot;
