Lloyds&amp;#039; website says that FPS will go from their internet banking and telephone banking services, but I&amp;#039;m guessing it&amp;#039;s not holding true for internet banking?    As for Barclays, all 20 sort codes (current accounts, deposits, misc.) are FPS enabled, but 23/25 are not as of yet (Barclaycard, loans, mortgages, etc.)
