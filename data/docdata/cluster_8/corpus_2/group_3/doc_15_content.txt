I got two WD10EAVS yesterday when I wanted WD10EACS. They chart just like you drives, faster than my four platter WD10EACS but with a 20ms access time.    As Cyber-Mav says, the access time is high because these drives are meant for PVR&amp;#039;s and need to be quiet Simply adjust the AAM to peformance and enjoy the 14.5ms access time that follows. (i&amp;#039;ve benched this using HD Tune, it drops over 5ms)    My biggest concern is the warranty but I cba to send them back.
