I was told that I was one of a &amp;#039;handful&amp;#039; of people still waiting.   Also that someone would call me in the next 48hrs.   When I asked when I would get my money, I was told they could put no time scale on that!  Any comments?                      Same old same old.  My 48 hours should end today and will let you know the result.  Have tried emailing  working.lunch@bbc.co.uk  to see if can get a bit of coverage (ok i know its doubtful - they got important diy tips to cover).  (Oh and if your name is anything to go by.. &amp;#039;up the city!!&amp;#039; If not please ignore.)  Chaps from KE 8/10 not arrived.
