 Yes, they&amp;#039;re OK.     They&amp;#039;re not owned by the US government either.     They just got a bunch of money in what is basically loans on very nice terms as a &amp;#039;bail out&amp;#039; because they are so big that when they ran into a short term problem with the mortgage mess in the US they couldn&amp;#039;t be allowed to &amp;#039;go under&amp;#039; like some of the banks have been allowed to do.     AIG is a financial services, insurance, banking, and bog roll manufacturing company here. Particularly because of that last one it is vital to the US that they stay afloat.     But it is not like the US government swarmed their offices and took over - they just gave them a big chunk of money and said &amp;#039;pay it off when you like&amp;#039; sugar daddy style.
