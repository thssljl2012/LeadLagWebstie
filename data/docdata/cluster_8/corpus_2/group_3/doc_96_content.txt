Hopefully not Nationwide, because they&amp;#039;ve been known to be a pain when it comes to moving shops.                      the company is GMAC   the other guys insurance is probably paying for it because it wasn&amp;#039;t my fault -_-&amp;amp;quot;&amp;amp;quot; but yea i guess il run down to toyota tomorrow and get an estimate for the damages since they are the people who made my car             Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  vegeta4ss                         bing was trying to sell his c2 race tranny a few months back but i dont think anyone picked it up. might want to look into that.    as far as the bad karma, i can&amp;#039;t explain what causes it. I&amp;#039;m nice to everyone, def dont do anything to deserve all the bs that gets thrown at me sometimes.  Oh well, it can only get better right?                      x2 definitely i dont know veg that well but hes been really helpful to me since I&amp;#039;ve been on this board
