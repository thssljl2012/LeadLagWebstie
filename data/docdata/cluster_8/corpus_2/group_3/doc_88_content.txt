 I&amp;#039;ve come across the same problem very recently.  I bought a computer from PC World and used the &amp;#039;buy now, pay later&amp;#039; offer where I could pay the full amount within 6 months and pay no interest.       I then received a letter from HFC Bank (who are financing the offer) who stated that if I wish to repay in full before the 6 monthe period was up then I would be charged an admin fee of 25!     Naturally, being careful with cash, I &amp;#039;phoned HFC Bank who said that this should be staed in the t&amp;#039;s and c&amp;#039;s given to me.  Sure enough, it was (I didn&amp;#039;t read the t&amp;#039;s and c&amp;#039;s   ) but I was still annoyed that It hadn&amp;#039;t been pointed out to me at the time of purchase.     Anyway, after a bit of an argument, the lady at HFC put me on hold and then came back and said that if I paid the full amount before the 15th December, then I wouldn&amp;#039;t incur the fee.  Where they got this date from I don&amp;#039;t know but I&amp;#039;m holding them to it and took the name of the person I was speaking to.     I also &amp;#039;phoned PC World and complained that this hadn&amp;#039;t been pointed out to me.  The guy on the &amp;#039;phone said that the person who had originally served me was normally good at remembering to point this out...well, not in this instance!  They did say that if I wanted to come in before the 28 day period and cancel the agreement and pay in full, I could, but I&amp;#039;m going to stick with HFC&amp;#039;s agreement.      I&amp;#039;ve taken out various buy now pay later&amp;#039;s before and never paid a fee...perhaps its the economic climate...
