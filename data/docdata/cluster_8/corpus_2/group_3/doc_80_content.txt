 Hi I have an ISA with a company called KIllik. I called them recently to sell my last remaining shares in Thus. My intention was to use the proceeds to re-invest in Barclays - brave me   - but when I asked about charges, I was told it would cost about 35 to sell and almost the same again to buy. 70 seemed very expensive for a total holding of c.3000, so I made this observation to them and said that because I thought the the charges were excessive I would simply sell and take the proceeds. They quoted the current price as 1.79 and change but I told them to sell at 1.80. Next, I receive two mails from Killik each listing a sale. Naturally, each sale had a fee applied -57 and 35 - totalling 92. Obviously I feel conned and hope someone out there can offer helpful advice. My current feeling is that I should have been advised of the possibility of multiple deals at the time of instruction, particularly since almost my entire conversation with them revolved around my displeasure with their charges. Any comment/advice will be much appreciated. Also, will someone tell me which body regulates this type of scenario.
