You have all sacrificed a lot for our country.     I don&amp;#039;t think either of them can get us out of this mess. Though Obama may not have the Experience that McCain has he has OPENLY stated he wil use his advisers. AS ALL PRESIDENTS DO. AMERICA is SOCIALIST AREADY and has been for a VERY LONG time.  No matter what they say BOTH of them wil have to raise taxes. They just spent all this money bailing out the rich. The poor people aren&amp;#039;t in the market. They don&amp;#039;t have stocks with AIG or ife insurance. Many people that are poor don&amp;#039;t have money in the bank they live paycheck to paycheck. Believe it or not MANY of them work and aren&amp;#039;t lazy. The people that HAVE lots of money $250,000 a year should pay to bail out the banks. People keep making this a race issue and a lower or midde class issue. IT&amp;#039;S NOT!!! Even Ed McMann was losing his house. People in VERY nice areas are being forcosed on just as much as the poor. If you coud only afford $500,000 home and the bank/greedy Investors wrote you a policy for a house that was $900,00. It is NO DIFFERENT then the person that bought a house for $200,000 and they could only afford $125,000. Most people Did okay POOR, MIDDLE CLASS, AND MORE WELL OFF until that adjustable intrest hit, that morgage sky rocketed then that was it. After a few months of trying to make it work, trying to get a new job, or second job in this economy was hard. Then the house is Forclosed on ALL FINANCIAL CLASSES.  Now though al these people that have been effected, ESPECIALLY the lower and middle class have to Bail out the people that they are WORLDS AWAY from. The Investors and Banks That still are in a pplace that WE can&amp;#039;t even imagine.
