 which I think are nuts.  1. Using tax dollars to insure losses suffered by financial institutions (which we&amp;#039;re already doing by the way, in case the Republicans didn&amp;#039;t notice--see FDIC insurance, Bear Stearns, AIG, Wachovia, etc.)  2. Relaxing mark to market rules (that seems to me to be a non starter; financial institutions get to restore value of bad assets they hold by just increasing the value of those assets on their books).   3. Reduction of capital gains tax (is there anything the Republicans don&amp;#039;t think can be solved with a tax break?).
