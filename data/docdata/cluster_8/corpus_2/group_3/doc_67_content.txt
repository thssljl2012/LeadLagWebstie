 When I got my ST from the TO they virtually spoonfed me the T &amp;amp;amp; C &amp;#039;s.      I had a similar problem with Barclays.  I went 1.57 overdrawn and they hit me with a 20 charge.  I phoned them up explained it was an accident and they refunded me straight away.      The problem is companies are just too big and it&amp;#039;s impossible for them to have a personal touch.  When was the last time you actually felt wanted by united and not just a number on their database?
