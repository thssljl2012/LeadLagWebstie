Consider the following... - The gov&amp;#039;t and taxpayers loaned AIG the money at something like LIBOR + 8%. It was not a gift or a grant. To pay back the loan, AIG must sell parts of its business, including its Life area, who ran this thing. - The Financial Products people under Cassano in London put AIG under, not the Life operation. Read the lead story in the Sunday NYT of 9/28 for all the details. - AIG&amp;#039;s insurance operations are some of the best in the world, and they need to get the best price they can for them when they sell them to pay back the loan. You don&amp;#039;t do that by aggravating the market and sending business away, thus lowering the value of the asset. - Lastly, you don&amp;#039;t just show up at a place like this, unannounced, and have fun. This was most likely paid for (or at least guaranteed) a long time ago. While the PR might look bad to the short-sighted (like Obama, who last night said they should all be fired...he is the clever idiot who is pandering for your votes to everyone&amp;#039;s short-sighted naiivite), what is the alternative? Pay the money, send a message to the life community that the life area is in bad shape, receive nothing for the cost, and lower the value of the asset they hope to sell to pay back the loan? Come on, people, think this through. Oh, yes, 1 more thing - this would never have happened if Greenberg (who run AIG with an iron fist) was not forced out by Spitzer.     How long ago do you think this trip was paid for? Before they had any idea that they were driving this company to bankruptcy and need to be rescued? Yes they are real deserving of this trip.
