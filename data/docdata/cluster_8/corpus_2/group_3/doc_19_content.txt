Well it&amp;#039;s good to see democracy is not yet dead.--------- Now everyone needs to educate themselves quickly as to the real problem which is &amp;amp;quot;Credit Default Swaps&amp;amp;quot;, which are nothing more then &amp;amp;quot;hedge bets&amp;amp;quot; via buying an insurance that AIG made available, that if there is a &amp;amp;quot;default&amp;amp;quot;, then AIG must pay out. There is a mountain of these due on October 6. Maybe over a trillion dollars worth, and now that the US Government took over and owns 80%, it is the taxpayer on the hook to make good on those payouts. That is really what this bailout is REALLY about!! They just don&amp;#039;t want the taxpayer to know that. Why? Because these CDS&amp;#039;s are really nothing more than a COMPLETELY UNREGULATED WAY TO GAMBLE where the gamblers collude with the bankers to make sure their bets are sure winners.--------- The EVIDENCE for this is plain to anyone who has been stonewalled by their lender refusing a renegotiation of their distressed loan. Many have even send beg,borrowed, and whatever, to scrape up multi thousand dollar checks to the loan servicers of their lenders to make them current again, yet what happens?? The check is rejected or &amp;amp;quot;we never received your check&amp;amp;quot; and then the loan company still persue the foreclosure, and maybe in some cases saying in the last week before the Trustee Sale, okay here&amp;#039;s our [ridiculous interest rate designed to make your payments even higher] terms, take it or pack your bags!!!------- Now the sum result of this being that the insurer has to pay up a &amp;amp;quot;bonus money&amp;amp;quot; (now to come directly from the taxpayers) over the premium cost to those holding the Credit Default Hedge bets!!!! AND, until the housing values began to decline, the lender would be able to make a profit in the equity that a foreclosed home still had over it&amp;#039;s outstanding note value. If I&amp;#039;m not mistaken, that&amp;#039;s called &amp;amp;quot;equity skimming&amp;amp;quot;. Illegal!!!!------ That&amp;#039;s the simple game, which is even further complicated by &amp;amp;quot;the players&amp;amp;quot; then &amp;amp;quot;swapping&amp;amp;quot; the &amp;amp;quot;Credit Default&amp;amp;quot; insurance contracts between themselves like little boys trading baseball cards. Why??? Well heaven forbid should it ever be discovered that lender XYZ was taking out insurance that loans that XYZ HAD THE ABILITY TO FORCE INTO FORECLOSURE DID JUST THAT!!!! Now for XYZ to directly collect that is way too easy to trace, &amp;amp;quot;So I&amp;#039;ll tell you what my compadre in the &amp;amp;quot;good ole boys club&amp;amp;quot;, I&amp;#039;ll trade you mine for yours, of same payout value. We&amp;#039;ll do this a number of times with other&amp;#039;s in the &amp;amp;quot;good ole boy&amp;amp;quot; network, and nobody will be the wiser, sound like a plan?&amp;amp;quot;---------- I think that&amp;#039;s called &amp;amp;quot;STACKING THE DECK&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;LOADING THE DICE&amp;amp;quot;, uh, maybe &amp;amp;quot;INSURANCE FRAUD&amp;amp;quot;!!!!!!!--- WE THE PEOPLE now need to demand IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION OF THIS BECAUSE UNTIL THOSE &amp;amp;quot;CAN&amp;#039;T LOSE HEDGE BETS&amp;amp;quot; ARE DECLARED VOID AS ILLEGAL, FRAUDULENT AND SIMPLE GAMBLING, THAT GAME WILL JUST GO ON AND ON, AND THE TAXPAYER WILL JUST GET SOAKED AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL THAT SCHEME IS STOPPED!!!!!!----  Most of our people in Congress know all about this charade, now we need to LET THEM KNOW THAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE CHARADE AS WELL!!!! Now you know the REAL REASON you can&amp;#039;t get a loan, because the more the defaults occur, the more they will PROFIT!!!!!!
