A lot of teams books are closed, Forbes&amp;#039; list is a lot of educated guessing.  No one knows if it&amp;#039;s actually anywhere close.  I&amp;#039;d also like to voice a little caution in just accepting the 50% or 5-7 teams thing.  As always, when the league is coming up on a CBA bargaining date the woe is us starts.  How many of you honestly think that these billionaires/hugely wealthy companies are just going to dump money in unprofitable ventures for very long?  No matter how much they love basketball and/or owning sports teams, most of these people didn&amp;#039;t get rich by losing money hand over fist.  Soon the talk of combating the &amp;amp;quot;teams are losing money&amp;amp;quot; stuff will begin: -Shorter contracts -Raising the age limit again -Smaller max contracts -Other ways to define revenue.  Shockingly, all things that the players would have to give up in order to help save the &amp;amp;quot;struggling&amp;amp;quot; NBA.
