         Sutch  I too had a good old whinge about it.   http://boards.fool.co.uk/Post.aspx?mid=11272958&amp;amp;amp;reply=tr...   I am NOT a happy bunny. I too feel that I have been really shabbily treated by Barclays. I have been a customer for years.I am so cross that I would not be inclined to buy any financial product from them in the future.   If your missis has another card then it&amp;#039;s still not all bad news.  This was my only card, and with the credit crunch on it&amp;#039;s not looking good on the new  credit card  application front. :((((  NIKKE
