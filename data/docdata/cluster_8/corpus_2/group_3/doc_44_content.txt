Oh, let me add another clarification.  Actually the one with the marked up exchange rate was cancelled by Citi when I reported it, no questions asked.      It&amp;#039;s the other one (probably at Barclays) that&amp;#039;s giving me trouble.  In that case, I cancelled it because some possibility for a fee was mentioned, so I cancelled to be on the safe side.    And I&amp;#039;ll post these lines from what I can find from my online statements:    xx-xx  NONCITIBANK ATM WITHDRAWAL Sep xx 17:15 yyyy  $ 143.48         xx-xx  NONCITIBANK ATM WITHDRAWAL Sep xx 17:26 yyyy  $ 143.48         xx-xx  NONCITIBANK ATM WITHDRAWAL Sep xx 10:21 yyyy  $ 143.48         xx-xx  NONCITIBANK ATM WITHDRAWAL Sep xx 17:14 yyyy  $ 157.83       Times are NYC time, so to get Spanish time, you need to add six hours.  I did the first withdrawal at 10:21, which was 4:21 pm.  (I had a connection in London.)    The next three withdrawals happened after 11 pm at night when I was walking to my hotel after dinner at Moo.    As mentioned, the $157.83 was voided with no incident after I called Citibank.  You can see that the last withdrawal that night was logged 11 minutes afterwards.  This was one at Deutsche bank.    Hope this clarifies things further, if you need that level of detail!
