You&amp;#039;d essentially just be tweaking what &amp;quot;privacy&amp;quot; is.                            Not according to most of the standard conservative opposition to Roe, which goes something like: Roe is entirely wrong because Griswold is wrong. Griswold is wrong because it made up a right to privacy not in the constitution.        The thought of a discretionary carve-out/exception for Roe is an absolute anathema to the jurisprudential framework proposed by Scalia etc, the heroes of the pro-life movement - which is purports to be all about consistent rules that can be applied across the board, without exception.  This really doesn&amp;#039;t fly at all in that context.       Also - what Mad Max said - Do you honestly think she is engaged in this type of high-level jurisprudential thinking? I sincerely sincerely sincerely doubt it.       This reminds me of the excuse when, at a softball, campaign-staged town hall Q&amp;amp;amp;A, Palin said the AIG bailout was necessary due to its &amp;quot;construction bonds.&amp;quot;       Her defenders claimed this was on purpose.       Now while it is indeed true that AIG, being such an incredibly massive organization, does in fact underwrite construction bond insurance.  However it controls only a tiny part of a very diverse market for that type of insurance (14th biggest provider or something -the failure of AIG&amp;#039;s construction bond business would be absolutely, completely inconsequential to the larger economy       AIG&amp;#039;s failure would be problematic for reasons completely unrelated to construction bonds.  So why even pretend to give her the benefit of the doubt when the most rational, simplest explanation indicates otherwise.
