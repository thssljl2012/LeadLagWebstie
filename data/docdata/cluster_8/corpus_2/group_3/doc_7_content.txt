My synthesis thought is that the &amp;amp;quot;bailout&amp;amp;quot; is necessary.  Also, please understand I&amp;#039;m a software engineer, not an economist.  I can do research, but I&amp;#039;m not taking a great understanding of economics into this.                           Fair enough.      The general consensus from economists and the market is that the gov&amp;#039;t needs to inject liquidity into the market SOMEHOW.

Not exactly.  They would just open up a window to let banks or other investors sell off their mortgages, or CDO&amp;#039;s, to raise cash.  Having cash on hand instead of on the books where they can&amp;#039;t touch it would allow them to begin lending to each other again.  Lending to each other is the lube that lets the whole wheel turn.

Quote:                          Originally Posted by  Quasius         One thing I&amp;#039;m not as clear on is this whole &amp;amp;quot;derivitive&amp;amp;quot; business.  It seems like people were making bets called &amp;amp;quot;derivitives&amp;amp;quot; on these mortgage-debt bonds.  As a consequence, what should have involved much less money (the value of the mortages) instead involved far more investors with much more stake in each mortgage than the mortgage is actually worth.  (Even at inflated housing prices.)                           A derivative in this case is an investment based on debt.  For example, I am a bank.  I own 100,000,000 in mortgages.  I take all of those mortgages and I have them rated by a 3rd party.  So they get a B+ rating.  I slap some insurance on them in the case of default (tyvm, AIG) and then I sell stakes in them to others.  Oftentimes those are large funds (pension, hedge) other times they are banks, and other times they are investment groups.  I sell these with a given rate of return based on the interest on the loans.      Once you have these derivatives, they can be traded and sold just like any other investment.  Which opens up a whole world of hedging tricks that investors played with.

Is that correct?  If so, what happens to all these people &amp;amp;quot;derivitive markets?&amp;amp;quot;  It sounds like a lot of banks (particularly JPMorgan) have a lot of these bad derivitives on their books.                           Even if it goes deeper, opening the window at 700B is enough to get things started.  And it tells the markets &amp;amp;quot;hay, we&amp;#039;re on it guys.&amp;amp;quot;  Which in and of itself instill confidence.      I mean, nothing changed yesterday in the market.  No study came in that showed weakness in the economy.  No one missed targets.  But the market dropped 700+ points.  It&amp;#039;s about perception and confidence.

Yes.  All accurate.
