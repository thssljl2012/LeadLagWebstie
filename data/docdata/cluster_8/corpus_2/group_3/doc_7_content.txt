Hi,      Is there a temporary fix for a creaking windscreen?       I had my screen replaced about a year ago and it really creaks very badly! My insurance company insists on only two nationwide fitters, and no amount of arguing with them will convince them to let me use a specialist to correct the issue. I have given the fitters two opportunities to correct the problem and it&amp;#039;s still not right, so until I have time to get it done properly (and have to pay for a new screen myself), I&amp;#039;m after a quick, even messy, fix.      Any ideas?      Thanks.
