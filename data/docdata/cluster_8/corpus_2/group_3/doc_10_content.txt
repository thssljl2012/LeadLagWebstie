 Hi i have just sent my first letter asking for the summary of the charges for the last 6 years to Barclays. I recieved them back but only for the last 2 years as they took over my account which was with the woolwich two years ago. Can i claim back the charges for the other 4 years i was with the woolwich and if so how? do i ring them or write again?
