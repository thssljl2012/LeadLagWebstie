Or are annuities FDIC insured, too?                      No, annuities are not FDIC insured.  There are fairly weak state-level guarantee pools that will mean diddly if a big insurer goes tits up and screws policyholders.  Anyone remember that Vanguard&amp;#039;s marketing partner forimmediate annuities was AIG?  The insurance companies in AIG have not imploded AFAIK, but I don&amp;#039;t imagine that those policyholders are feeling real secure these days.
