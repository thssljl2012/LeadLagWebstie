I&amp;#039;m currently paying interest only and that&amp;#039;s going to have to continue until the economy picks up. I guess it&amp;#039;s not in their interest to push me into capital repayments too, because the house has almost no equity in it!    Skylight&amp;#039;s subsequent post to this is 100% true and very FRIGHTENING!      I&amp;#039;ve been with HSBC since I was 13 and have had the same account manager for the past ten years. We&amp;#039;ve always got on really well which, I hope, might help to reduce any unpleasantness which might otherwise go on, and which is why I think I may just be upfront with them about what the future holds.                      I had a Barclays account for over 18 years when I started have financial trouble.  I had never once been overdrawn in all of that time.  However as soon as I went over my agreed o/d limit they were quick to send letters and their phone calls were probably the most consistent out of any of my other creditors - well equally matched by MBNA!  I obviously felt more sentimental about all the years of banking I had done with them over the years than they were.  You&amp;#039;re only as good as your last deposit with banks!
