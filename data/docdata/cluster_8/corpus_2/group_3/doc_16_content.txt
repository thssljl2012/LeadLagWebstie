In the news today there&amp;#039;s a story that the heads of RBS, Lloyds and Barclays have asked the Chancellor to hurry up with a rescue package.      Now, is it just me or...      WTF!!!      Do these people have no shame?      Surely the response to any suggestions from these 3 dwarves is:       &amp;amp;quot;If you had a friggin&amp;#039; clue about what&amp;#039;s good for the economy - or if you actually cared about the economy, rather that just your own profits - we wouldn&amp;#039;t be in this mess.      You&amp;#039;re either idiots - in which case we should ignore you - or you&amp;#039;re self-interested at the expense of the economy - in which case we should ignore you.      So, shut the feck up and go sit in the corner.      ... and      ... you better pray that the economy gets fixed or the 3 of you are going to need major plastic surgery, a change of name and a move to a new town... because if the economy goes tits up, half the country will be ready to string you from the nearest lamppost.&amp;amp;quot;      Is that what Alistair Darling told them?      Or did the badger faced moron say, &amp;amp;quot;you&amp;#039;re the experts, sirs, I&amp;#039;ll do whatever you think is best&amp;amp;quot;...      Steve
