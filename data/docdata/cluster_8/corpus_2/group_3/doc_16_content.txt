This is  is the  thread to this whole crisis that crazyray didn&amp;#039;t put in in his overview, and it is the key in many ways to why the financial crisis got so bad.     It&amp;#039;s the unregulated derivatives market that the investment banks created as bets over the top of the actual mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.     They issues billions upon billions of dollars of these instruments that were essentially just bets as to how the prices of their underlying securities would move. These were super-leveraged, in the case of some hedge funds we are talking effective leverage rates of up to 100 to 1. Also, they were largely invisible to anyone but the participants, as they were created privately by the investment banks and not reported or collated anywhere but on their books.     When the housing market started to go down, on top of all the potential actual defaults by homeowners, these financial companies were caught holding bets that dropped in price  at a much faster rate than the underlying mortgage securities themselves.    Investors likeWarren Buffett called the derivatives financial time bombs that should have been made illegal. But it was just too profitable for the SEC and the Congress to regulate while the market was going up. So now we have the result. A massive financial meltdown.  If it hadn&amp;#039;t been for the unregulated, and largely opaque/secret derivatives market, this likely would have just been a protracted busted housing bubble, not a financial meltdown.    This is the kiddie version (all I can remember off the top of my head) and so is missing some stuff I am sure. If  you really want to know about it, read either The Trillion Dollar Meltdown by Charles Morris or the new book by George Soros, The  New Paradigm for Financial Markets.    Morris&amp;#039;s is an easier read. Soros&amp;#039;s is super deep but harder to get into and he spends half the book explaining his concept of &amp;amp;quot;reflexivity&amp;amp;quot;. before wading into the nitty gritty of the financial crisis. They are both experts on their subject though.                        Exactly, and this is what we were talking about in the AIG thread, and why this crisis has hit the economy on so many levels...not just housing, not just banking, but the entire umbrella of the financial industry.    People look at AIG and go &amp;amp;quot;well how the fuck is an insurer falling into this shitstorm??&amp;amp;quot;    What people don&amp;#039;t realize is that there are more then just auto insurance, health insurance and life insurance. There is another sub-category of insurance companies that deal in financial insurance. These financial insurers, which make up the majority of AIG&amp;#039;s portfolio, are the companies that underwrite these unregulated exotic financial derivative packages that you were explaining. It&amp;#039;s a vicious trickle down process. Actually more like a &amp;amp;quot;trickle up&amp;amp;quot; in the case of the current crisis. It goes something like this    Housing bubble bursts (the middle class is fucked)  which leads to:  Foreclosures come rolling in (The banks are fucked)  which leads to:  Exotic Derivatives deteriorate exponentially (Investment Banks/Hedge Funds = fucked)  which leads to:  Financial Insurers take INCREDIBLE and unsustainable hits resulting in massive losses (huge financial corporations, ala AIG.......yep you guessed it......FUCKED)
