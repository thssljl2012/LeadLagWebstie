  I love ya&amp;#039; Mudflap... I tell you, one learns something new everyday here... gotta love it.    I was in a nice position of being privy to the news right before it broke so I was able to see what was published and how it was interpreted by the media and how it evolved. The truth, whole truth, and nothing but the truth of the story was quickly dismissed in favor of sensationalism and ratings grabs.   I can tell you that the $85 billion number is a total load of garbage that has nothing to do with reality. The so-called &amp;quot;experts&amp;quot; had absolutely no idea about insurance companies operate, so they just made stuff up as it went along, misread almost everything, and came up with big and pretty numbers to out-number the competition.   I tell you, the average American is a complete dunce... just love it... LOL Ignorance is bliss man, ignorance is bliss.
