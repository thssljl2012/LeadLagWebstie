 I thought I would write a considered reply to this and give sometime to it rather then rush into it. I would be grateful if you can actually read your signature I have been polite to you and have not made any coments about you. It seems to me that you and your colleague here only post on selective threads and avoid the one&amp;#039;s where you know your views will be ignored or you will get a real bashing. Let me give you an example there are a lot of angry students but I have not seen a single comment about HSBC defending their actions. Here is the link  http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/....html?t=991967 .     BTW Yes I am angry with the banks but I am also angry HSBC for treating their customers like dirt.

Im not sure where you are going with this.... If your a taxpayer, You should be pretty annoyed with the above.     This thread is supposed to be about the changing of bank accounts not which bank has lost money... All banks have lost money, most more than HSBC.. That speaks volumes in itself.
