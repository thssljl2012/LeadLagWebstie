           t really doesn&amp;#039;t take that long for anyone with average intelligence. Anyone incapable of understanding the T&amp;amp;amp;Cs should not be allowed control of their own finances.   Have you not hit the nail on the head?  Once you have read the T&amp;amp;amp;C then it becomes apparent that in the current model there is nowhere safe to put ones money.  How is the average punter supposed to reach the conclusion that the Co-op (which i understand is funded totally by savers deposits) is orders of magnitude safer than Barclays?
