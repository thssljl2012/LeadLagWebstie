Maybe timing is part of the problem, it came across as a slap in the face to taxpayers. It creates animosity, how will that ultimately effect their insurance business?      I have a personal interest in Wachovia. Good strong bank, made a mistake in the purchase of Golden West. I still don&amp;#039;t think they were in as dire a position as the media put out there. And I believe that the media helped to drive their stock down. That said, I don&amp;#039;t imagine anyone associated with Wachovia, CitiGroup, or Wells Fargo would shove it to their investors by doing what AIG just did. It&amp;#039;s all about perspective and that is about marketing.
