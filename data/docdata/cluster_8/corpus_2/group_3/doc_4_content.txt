First of all, I&amp;#039;m not a supporter of the bail out plan....or Obama&amp;#039;s socialistic &amp;amp;quot;change&amp;amp;quot; he wants to bring to America. But you all aren&amp;#039;t getting the whole story here.      First off, these &amp;amp;quot;Executives&amp;amp;quot; aren&amp;#039;t actual employees of AIG. They are the big time salesman of their Insurance. They have plenty of other insurance companies that they can chose from to sell to potential customers, hence why they were referred to as &amp;amp;quot;customers&amp;amp;quot; in the story. This is normal practice by AIG and insurance companies to &amp;amp;quot;win&amp;amp;quot; support by these agents who are then swayed to sell AIG more than the next company. Granted, I don&amp;#039;t agree with this type of practice, but it&amp;#039;s the way it has been for awhile now. All these trips happen multiple times EVERY year. It&amp;#039;s almost an &amp;amp;quot;advertisement&amp;amp;quot; budget type of expense. To quote the article which was quoting AIG  &amp;amp;quot;all nonessential conferences, meetings and activities that do not clearly  maximize  value and service given the current conditions.&amp;amp;quot; I bolded the part that was important. As while from the outside it seems as careless spending, it&amp;#039;s something that brings about extra business to the company, by swaying those big time agents to sell AIG.       So, I ask you what&amp;#039;s worse? Loaning a crap ton of money to this business and make it stop these trips, and inturn lose business, and then lose profit? Or, have them continue this advertising and keep business profits normal, or higher? Which in turn, will help them payback the money quicker.      And btw....I&amp;#039;d definitely vote for Ted!                      I have heard discussions about how it drums up their business.  Like stated above, I still think its over the top.  Having a conference at a  reasonable  location and even catering some decent food is one thing... But staying at the  St. Regis Resort ?  Com&amp;#039;on now bud...  honestly, who think that&amp;#039;s  reasonable ?  check that link and check out their rates at that place!  tsk tsk tsk...
