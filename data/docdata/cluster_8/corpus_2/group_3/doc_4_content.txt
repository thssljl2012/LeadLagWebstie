         My father-in-law currently owns a Calif Muni (among other investments - Franklin Class A Income fund and AIG Annuity Insurance Bonus Flex 7-3 Year Guarantee (valuation 8-08)) that is willed to my wife and her two brothers upon his death. My question is what happens if he passes away prior to the maturation of the bond? Does the bond have to be surrendered with the associated loss (considering todays market)? At this time the surrender value of the bond is -$9K+ if it&amp;#039;s cashed today. My understanding is, if the bond is held until it matures, the full 3.84% return will be realized; however, if the bond is cashed prior to that time, any loss/gain will be realized. Is this an accurate understanding of the situation, or do I have it all wrong?  My father-in-law is currently 84 and had a quadruple bypass approximately 6 years ago. The likelyhood of his surviving more than a couple of years is unlikely; therefore, I&amp;#039;d like to advise my wife on the best course of action to maximize return. She is the Executor of her Dad&amp;#039;s estate, has Power of Attorney of his financial dealings, and her Dad has stated it&amp;#039;s up to her to make the &amp;amp;quot;right&amp;amp;quot; decision.  Can someone advise me as to a reasonable course of action cionsidering the current financial climate we&amp;#039;re in. Should I be more worried about the AIG Annuity?  Thanks in advance for any help.  R/,
