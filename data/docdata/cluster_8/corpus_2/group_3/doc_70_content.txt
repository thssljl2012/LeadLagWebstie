Update:  Was promoted to the Commercial Sales Agent for Nationwide Insurance.  Kind of a big deal, very nice to be working with people who at least have enough intelligence to keep a business running, and actually care about what they are getting instead of &amp;amp;quot;What&amp;#039;s the legal minimum to get me on the road...&amp;amp;quot;  Not to mention the much better commissions...
