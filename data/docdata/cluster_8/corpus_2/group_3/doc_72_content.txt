 No problem at all I don&amp;#039;t want to put you in a difficult position.  I probably will pursue it as the damage has been done and I have now closed my account down.  Thankfully my salary wasn&amp;#039;t going into that account!I went into my local Branch to query the address etc and was given a Customer Complaint Acknowledgement slip with a reference on it stating that the complaint was being handled by Retail Bank CR DC Complaints Gateway.  I hadn&amp;#039;t heard anything so I contacted Customer Service and was told verbally that the complaint was closed down, as they didn&amp;#039;t want to write to me because of the problem surrounding the address.Not sure whether there is more they can do - apparently someone had trawled through all information but was inconclusive?
