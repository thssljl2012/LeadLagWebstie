          I have accounts in both. Both with less than 50000 in but I wouldn&amp;#039;t want the hassle that Icelandic bank customers are undergoing. Would you move the money to UK banks?    A few weeks ago, I had a bit of panic about losing access to our money should ICICI go under, and I withdrew the majority of it.  I put it back into ICICI yesterday having got over my wobble.  ICICI (UK)  is  a UK bank.  That is, it&amp;#039;s run under UK regulations and is as well covered as any &amp;amp;quot;proper&amp;amp;quot; UK bank (Barclays, Lloyds etc.).  If it goes bust, you get your 50,000 back eventually.  ING is covered for more money under the Dutch regulations - I trust the Dutch Government to pay up as much as I trust the British Government.  If it is access you are worried about, then transfer sufficient funds into one or two other accounts so that you are spreading it about a bit.  Personally, I wouldn&amp;#039;t move it all out of ICICI and ING (note - personally).  HTH  Ronnie
