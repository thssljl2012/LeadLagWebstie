Your initial comment about that being theoretical is what I tried to address. Your comment suggested that it is no longer possible.                      Yes: it is possible to make yourself more comfortable but secure? No. You have to be rich to be comfortable  and  secure. The days of coming to America and becoming rich are pretty much over. You have to be part of the established elite to be rich (unless you&amp;#039;re a sports star or in movies).         Quote:                         Re banking...I get the irony but see Community Reinvestment Act of 1995. Deregulation is not the only thing to have contributed to bringing about the problems here.    JD, your reference to irony - nice touch - leads to another irony. We have focused here on the U.S bank but can someone please address how more heavily regulated bank systems such as in Denmark have situations where Fortis went down, for example? Europe&amp;#039;s banks seems to be having similar problems and the real estate market seems to be falling apart just like the U.S.&amp;#039;s market. Does this show that &amp;amp;quot;decoupling&amp;amp;quot; is a fiction or is that the problems there are different?                     In Australia we have had two major financial institutions collapse in 20 years: Pyramid Building Society in the late 1980s and HIH about 7 - 8 years ago. Since then our government has tightened up on bank lending policies and particularly on financial institutions not backed by the Reserve Bank of Australia. To be called a &amp;amp;quot;bank&amp;amp;quot; here, you have to have backing from the RBA. I&amp;#039;m guessing the same thing exists in the US with the Federal Reserve.    The end result is that in Australia we will not be seeing anything like Bear Stearns, Lehman Bros or Washington Mutual, not even on a small scale. The National Australia Bank has some limited exposure but it involves less than 4% of its total funds.    This could not happen in the US because any attempt to ensure banks are responsible lenders by legislating to to the serve the best interests of the public is regarded as &amp;amp;quot;socialist&amp;amp;quot; or even &amp;amp;quot;communist&amp;amp;quot; and not allowed. The US government is called &amp;amp;quot;communist&amp;amp;quot; if it even tries to ensure any kind of safety measures.
