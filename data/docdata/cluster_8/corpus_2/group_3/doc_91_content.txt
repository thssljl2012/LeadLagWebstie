Actually, it was on the ABC Nightly News tonight.   Execs&amp;#039; Posh Retreat After Bailout Angers Lawmakers, Lawmakers learn insurance giant AIG sent execs on pricey retreat soon after bailout .  Not making it up. This is exactly what I am talking about. Out of touch execs who are greedy and do not care about their company, just their paychecks.   To many people are trying to blame the wrong person instead of the right people. Many of you want to blame President Bush for the mess that banks and Wall Street is in, but face it. Company practices are the reason we have had a housing meltdown (actually I am glad it happened as now at least 50 acres of trees a day are not being cut down in the Metro Atlanta area) when they decided to take on sub-prime loans that went to people who could not begin to pay then off. Yes, there are some that had real bad luck (like the truck driver that can&amp;#039;t work due to injuries), but most had bad credit to begin with and should never have been allowed to get a mortgage.      &amp;quot;Do not build your community around a game....
