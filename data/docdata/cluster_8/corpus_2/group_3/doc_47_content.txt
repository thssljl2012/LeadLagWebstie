I have several cash isas from previous years too. I am considering consolidating all these into one isa, at Natwest, which is offering a good rate. My question is, am I able to go to Natwest now, and transfer my previous isas (except for the 2008/2009 one), or do I have to wait till end dec, and then transfer all of them, including the 2008/2009 isa?                      Once you have an asset inside an ISA wrapper you can transfer it between similar ISA wrappers (ie: cash ISA at Barclays to cash ISA at NatWest) without HMRC tax restriction (although the individual ISA accounts might have their own bank&amp;#039;s restrictions on them, I can&amp;#039;t speak for that).     So yes, if you have 5 cash ISAs from previous years, you can consolidate them all into this year&amp;#039;s cash ISA even if you&amp;#039;ve already paid your limit into it because they&amp;#039;re already in the magical tax defeating magnetic resonance shield of their ISA status. Set phasers to stun!
