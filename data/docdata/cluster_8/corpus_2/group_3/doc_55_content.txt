 Nope, not at all worried.  When the smell of fear drifts away we&amp;#039;ll be left with a couple of very large banks and RBS, Barclays, Lloyds and HSBC are the best funded in the UK.     In the worst case senario Worldpay would get sold as an asset to a.n.other bank, there are bigger fish than you or me relying on their ever so wonderful service
