There can be varying levels of Signature as well, but not for this card as of now.  One card, as in the VX Visa Signature card, but if the cardholder doesn&amp;#039;t meet the threshold, they&amp;#039;ll issue a VX Visa Platinum instead.  Yes, different limits, with a few less benefits.  (no concierge service, etc.)  Should be the same points earn, as far as I know.  Will not be a random Barclaycard, it would still be a VX card.
