.... some sort of foreclosure relief isn&amp;#039;t addressed in the bill ....   Well it&amp;#039;s good to see democracy is not yet dead.   Now everyone needs to educate themselves quickly as to the real problem which is &amp;amp;quot;Credit Default Swaps&amp;amp;quot;, which are nothing more then &amp;amp;quot;hedge bets&amp;amp;quot; by buying an insurance that AIG made available, that if there is a &amp;amp;quot;default&amp;amp;quot;, then AIG must pay out. There is a mountain of these due on October 6. Maybe over a trillion dollars worth, and now that the US Government took over and owns 80% of AIG, it is the taxpayer on the hook to make good on those payouts. That is what this bailout is REALLY about!! They just don&amp;#039;t want the taxpayer to know that. Why? Because these Credit Default Swaps are really nothing more than a COMPLETELY UNREGULATED WAY TO PULL THE WOOL OVER EVERYONE&amp;amp;quot;S EYES!!! You see the gamblers in collusion with the bankers AND THE BANKERS THEMSELVES make sure their bets are sure winners.    The EVIDENCE for this is plain to anyone who has been stonewalled or heard from someone who has, that their lender refused a renegotiation of their distressed loan. Many have even beg, borrowed, and whatever else necessary, to scrape up enough to send multi thousand dollar checks to the loan servicers of their lenders so they could become them current in their payments again. Yet what happens?? The check is rejected or &amp;amp;quot;we never received your check&amp;amp;quot; and then the loan company goes ahead and still persues the foreclosure. Maybe in some cases saying in the last week before the Trustee Sale, &amp;amp;quot;okay here&amp;#039;s our [ridiculous interest rate designed to make your payments even higher] terms, take it or pack your bags!!!&amp;amp;quot;    Now the sum result of this being that the insurer has to pay up the insurance benefit (now to come directly from the taxpayers) which is way higher than the premium cost paid by those holding the Credit Default Hedge bets!!!! EASY MONEY AS LONG AS THE SCAM ARTISTS CAN FIND A PERPETUAL MONEY SUPPLY LIKE THE US TAXPAYERS!!!   Also, until the housing values began to decline, the lender would be able to make a profit in the equity that a foreclosed home still had over it&amp;#039;s outstanding note value. If I&amp;#039;m not mistaken, that&amp;#039;s called &amp;amp;quot;equity skimming&amp;amp;quot;. Illegal!!!! No wonder all the Congressional meetings are in secret!!!!     That&amp;#039;s the simple game, which is even further complicated by &amp;amp;quot;the players&amp;amp;quot; then &amp;amp;quot;swapping&amp;amp;quot; the &amp;amp;quot;Credit Default&amp;amp;quot; insurance contracts between themselves like little boys trading baseball cards. Why??? Well heaven forbid should it ever be discovered that lender XYZ was taking out insurance that loans which XYZ ALSO JUST HAPPENED TO HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO FORCE INTO FORECLOSURE, ENDED UP DOING JUST THAT!!!! What an AMAZING COINCIDENCE, eh????
