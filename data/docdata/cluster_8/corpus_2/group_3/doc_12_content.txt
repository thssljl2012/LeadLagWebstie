 It all depends on how USA deals with their subprime mortgage problem right now.  Since that bill hasn&amp;#039;t passed yet, it all hinges on that or some other solution.    If NO solution is passed, then USA is definitely 100% going into recession.   Canada will follow for sure, no doubt about that.    Worse over?  Absolutely not.         First banks.... now insurance.... then in a few months credit companies....   US govern. rescued AIG insurance from bankruptcy, by lending it tons of money at 12% interest rate (double check this).  So even if they survive, they still need to repay for years to come.    3 huge banks already died.   Others being bought up by others, hanging on, may bankrupt too.      If USA goes into recession, then entire world will be affected as well.    So, personally, yes, my opinion would be, sell them into GICs for now, wait and see.        Why go DOWN with the ship to be able to go back UP with it later?   Keep watching it, as the market goes back up, we&amp;#039;ll all know when that happens, buy back into your mutual fund.    Also, we HOPE it will go back up.  Many mutual funds have banks as their top 10 holdings, so if yours has it, watch out.   Imagine your mutual fund was holding Lehman bros?
