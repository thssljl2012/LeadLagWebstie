         Well not too much happening at the moment on my thread after it was so so manic.  Lodger is in, paid her money to card mortgage payment been paid this month.  Must confess really finding it hard to work out how to stick to a budget with the shopping when using debit card and also keeping to a clothes budget of ten quid a month.. I work in plain clothes in an office and am inthe public forefront a lot.  Its winter and freezing and I dont have any jumpers...  Know this needs to be addressed.  On another note TESCO my 18.9% card that Im snowballing offered me a 1.9 rate for 6 months.. with a 2.5 handling fee, I only owe around 700 to them now and the credit limit is around 5k I think.  I did think I could transfer the barclays card which is at 6.9 for the life.. The bloke at Tesco is ringing me back on Saturday, he was very insistant.  What shall I do?
