          and I&amp;#039;d open one with Barclays probably, but I&amp;#039;m not sure if I can do that or not, anyone know of any reason why not?   There is no reason at all why you can not have multiple business accounts, many companies do.  But for a contractor, unless you have over 35,000 (or is it 50,000 now?) in the business, what&amp;#039;s the point?  I do keep personal funds at a different bank to business and would not be happy having the 2 A/Cs at the same bank for a variety of reasons, but unless my business were to increase in another country, can not think of an advantage to having a second bank.
