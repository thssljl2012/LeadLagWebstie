 Had three cards Barclays, Monument and Citi, downloaded letter wrote to all three only Barclaycard replied, both others have cashed the cheques for the fee, but as yet have sent no information and their 40 days what do i do next? Can someone please help    Had a reply from Barclaycard, as the account is closed they referred me to the collection agents dealing with the account, they like this site said i need to get the charges back from Barclaycard. Do i now take them to court? Still waiting for Monument &amp;amp;amp; Citi to reply, anyone have any ideas to hurry them up?
