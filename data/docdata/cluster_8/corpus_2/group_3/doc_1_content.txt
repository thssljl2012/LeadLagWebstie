Thanks!                           not to take away from the thread:      My parents have farmers, and I keep telling them to switch, but they&amp;#039;re &amp;amp;quot;helping out a friend&amp;amp;quot; who is a farmers agent, so they stick with it.      Just a few months ago, my stepsister got into an accident where some lady backed out into her in a parking lot (don&amp;#039;t know 100% of the story, but that&amp;#039;s what she said).  Both the lady and my stepsister have farmers, and after a few weeks farmers came to the conclusion that both drivers were at fault (didn&amp;#039;t get the police report, didn&amp;#039;t talk to either drivers, and never got any pictures of the accident).  This way, both parties don&amp;#039;t get any insurance money from farmers, unless they pay the deductible, yet both get to pay increased premiums since both now have a recent accident on their record.         Back to the thread:  When I had 21st, I reported a hit and run, and they said I had to pay the deductible to make sure I didn&amp;#039;t just make up the hit and run story.  I had a police report, and a really cool driver pulled over and gave me their information telling me I could call them for a witness.  A few weeks later, I had a $6xx check, which I believe included the deductible.
