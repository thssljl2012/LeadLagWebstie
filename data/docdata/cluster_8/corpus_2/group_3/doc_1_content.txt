It&amp;#039;s going to depend on a host of things, especially ambient temps outside and length of time. And can you even prove there&amp;#039;s damage? Open a bottle and it tastes fine. No damage? Open it and it tastes awful. Damaged by the cooling failure? It seems that the costs of determining damage, if any, including litigation, would often exceed the value of the wine.                           i&amp;#039;ve always wondered that too - when it is a heat damage issue, who&amp;#039;s to say the wine is bad without obvious indicators like leakage, raised corks, etc.     when i inquired to an agent about chubb and aig wine insurance this summer i was told that i first had to go out and buy a generator - which kind of takes away the need for the insurance in the first place - with a generator i&amp;#039;ll just self-insure.
