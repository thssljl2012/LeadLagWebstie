Now I have HIFX saying that it&amp;#039;s a legally binding contract and I must honor it. What are my options?     Cheers  Mark                          I really don&amp;#039;t know the answer Mark.    On the face of it HIFX are entitled to do you for whatever is covered in their contract conditions. You will have to look at the terms and conditions on their website to see what this is likely to be.    Barclays are the cause so you will have to try to get recourse from them.    This aint no help but shows the mess they have created.   http://digital-lifestyles.info/2007/...ntry-disaster/   You probably aren&amp;#039;t the only one in this boat.
