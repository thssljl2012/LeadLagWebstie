 As in the title really.    I am 16 -- Barclays have offered me a  Visa Debit Card and Natwest have offered me a Solo card.    I just want to know which card is really better.    Also 2 more questions:    1) Can you use a Visa Debit wherever you see the Visa logo - if not then where?  2) Can you use the Solo card where you see the Maestro logo or only Solo logo...?    Thanks
