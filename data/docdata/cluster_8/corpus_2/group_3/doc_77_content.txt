 Hi, DH and I are starting on a DMP and I need some advice. I am needing to set up a basic account, but I am not sure where to apply for one. Our current creditors are: Halifax, RBS, Cahoot, Virgin, Tesco Finance, Barclays and EGG.   Does anyone know of a bank which is not linked to these which offers a basic account???     Thanks in advance.
