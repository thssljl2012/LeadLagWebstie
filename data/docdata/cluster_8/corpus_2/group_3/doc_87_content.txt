Or maybe they aren&amp;#039;t:      ABC News: After Bailout, AIG Execs Head to California Resort      &amp;amp;quot; Less than a week after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail out AIG, executives of the giant AIG insurance company headed for a week-long retreat at a luxury resort and spa, the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach, California, Congressional investigators revealed today.&amp;amp;quot;            And NPR wasn&amp;#039;t behind it- they mentioned that a Washington insider had suggested it- I just can&amp;#039;t remember who. The point is that this is not a Maverick original. And more importantly, it&amp;#039;s untimely.                        Neither the dumb homeowner who went into mortgages with teaser rates or neg amm or the CEO&amp;#039;s deserve a bailout. Let them pay for their mistakes! I guess this is where you and I have a vast rift in idealogy.     Of course NPR just happened to mention it. lol  Why untimely, Obama is planning an extra Trillion, why not add 300 Billion more...after all they are only politicians trying to sway you.
