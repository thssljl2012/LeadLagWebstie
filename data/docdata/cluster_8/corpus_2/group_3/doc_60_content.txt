Hi, Thank you for your welcoming reply. I am glad I finally wrote down how I feel. I think I got into this mess because I have not been honest about lots of things to do with my marriage, I am more afraid of the upset at home than the banks.    Quote:   If you&amp;#039;ve been with Payplan was this recent and how/why did you default on the payments. I don&amp;#039;t mean why did you not pay but more why could you not pay. This can only mean that your I &amp;amp;amp; E was not a realsitic one and maybe you need to do a more honest up to date one and get in touch with CCCS to start another DMP if this is the route you&amp;#039;re thinking of.   I was very uncomfortable with the link into my husbands earnings with the DMP with Payplan. I had to pay 192 a month which I found difficult when my earnings crashed and I couldnt ask my husband to help me. It  Barclays refused to take any payments from Payplan for 4 months and then took me to court instead, which I thought was totally wrong at the time , they actually refunded the money back to Payplan to do this. I received a refund from Payplan which I used to pay a months rent for my office.  I have to remain optimistic that the media driven credit crunch reporting stops so that my business doesnt fail as it is at the moment. I sometimes think I should give up and get a flat paid by housing benefit and rely on the state instead. Then they can make me bankrupt and leave me in peace.  Purple.  If you have no assets to protect theres not a lot creditors can do, but there are more options for you and I&amp;#039;m sure someone will be along to better advise.[/quote]
