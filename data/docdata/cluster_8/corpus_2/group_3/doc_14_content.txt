I was up early in the morning in Japan watching the US House of Representatives reject the 700 billion dollar bailout. The announcer on CNN and the standby experts were going nuts about how this would destroy America.   The NO votes are traitors to America! Congressman Dent, 15th district, voted NO so I tried to send a message to say he is doing good and next Thursday vote NO again. Michael Moore says this is the biggest robbery in the history of the world. The US just gave 25 billion to the car companies last week. Before that it was the mortgage loan companies, then AIG insurance company. This is amazing. Looks like Communism is coming in through the back door. Ha!  Guess what? I sent messages to my congressman and our two senators. The messages were rejected because government congressional internet servers are shut down. You can not contact your congressman via internet. Wow! Please try and good luck!
