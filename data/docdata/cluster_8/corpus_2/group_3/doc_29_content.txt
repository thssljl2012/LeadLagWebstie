Those aren&amp;#039;t &amp;amp;quot;major&amp;amp;quot; in the sense that RBS, HSBC or Barclays are.. I&amp;#039;d be tempted to call them minnows in comparison    The RBS is a Giant banking conglomerate.. it owns Natwest and has assets of well over 2 trillion pounds, and HSBC, our biggest bank (which has European operations in Germany, France, Switzerland, Ireland, the Czech Republic, Malta and Turkey, and runs other UK operations such as First Direct), has over 3 times the market value of RBS.    In comparison, last year B&amp;amp;amp;B had assets of about 65 billion euros (and for Icesavers: Landsbanki about 32 billion)    If either of the big 3 went bust.. well.. I can&amp;#039;t really imagine what sort of knock on effect it would have, but I&amp;#039;d buy chickens, a cow, a wheelbarrow, and as many Ray Mears books as possible. Then I&amp;#039;d move to Barbados, just to confuse everyone.    As for compensation, as I understand it the FCSC would have no chance at being able to cover it, as it relies on other banks that have signed up to the FCSC to stump the cash - but to make sure they aren&amp;#039;t all dragged down as well there is a cap on how much can be levied from these other banks. As Martin has said, this amount would not even come close as it would barely cover the 25th largest UK bank
