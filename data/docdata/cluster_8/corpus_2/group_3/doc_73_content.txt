   Judged:     1       Welding a tank filled with a flammable liquid is NUTS!  &amp;amp;quot;The Honolulu Fire Department continued its investigation yesterday to determine the cause of the explosion.&amp;amp;quot;  Hint: Welding involves high temperatures. Guess what happens to flammable liquids when they get hot? They generate vapor, which has a tendency to--uhm, EXPLODE!  I hope their insurance company isn&amp;#039;t AIG.
