I was thinking about going with the wealth package but i only have 290k with the CBA. So they wouldnt drop it further under 500k?  I wonder if it would even be worth going with the wealth package. I have a personal loan which is 9k and i am in the process of buying a house which is 280k and thats all so maybe wouldnt be worth while.
