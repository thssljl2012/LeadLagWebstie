&amp;gt;                             I&amp;#039;m not an economist, and I may use the wrong words and offer bad information, but here&amp;#039;s how I understand it. Caveat emptor. Part 1: Confidence is low. One result is that the few lenders that are solvent won&amp;#039;t lend anybody money because they&amp;#039;re afraid any loan they make is at serious risk of default. This means that employers will have no operating capital, leading to layoffs, and interest rates will skyrocket for the loans they actually do make, leading to inflation. Think food and gas are expensive now? just wait. It also means that it&amp;#039;ll be hard to get credit. Several banks have been closing equity lines of credit. If you&amp;#039;re actually in a position to buy anything, you might need more cash than you expected; and more employers are going to feel the pinch because they can&amp;#039;t sell us stuff. I think we buy too much stuff, but still, it&amp;#039;ll be painful. Part 2: the stock market crashed yesterday, and I don&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;ll come back until they do... something. You don&amp;#039;t hold any stocks? If you have a 401K plan at work, if you have or expect a pension, if your employer is self-insured, then this affects you. If you have a life insurance plan, watch the companies. If more of those fail (AIG, the biggest one, just did), those premiums may have disappeared down a black hole, and if you&amp;#039;ve developed a preexisting condition, you may be uninsurable.  Part 3: I&amp;#039;m sure you already know that your money isn&amp;#039;t actually sitting in the vault at the bank. It&amp;#039;s loaned out, and the bank depends on the steady repayment of their loans to pay you for the use of your money. If all of the bad mortgages are allowed to default, your money won&amp;#039;t be coming back. The government will have to pay you, instead, up to the FDIC limit. Money market funds at your bank are insured, but the money market mutual funds that financial planners have been touting for years as a low-risk place to invest are not. The government is considering insuring these, but I don&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;s a done deal.  Is the best course of action a gazillion taxpayer dollars pumped into the markets? I don&amp;#039;t know. But I&amp;#039;m pretty sure we&amp;#039;re going to pay for it one way or the other. That FDIC deposit insurance is going to come out of our pockets anyway, if there&amp;#039;s a run on the banks; and I&amp;#039;ll bet your retirement funds have dropped 25% over the last year. If it&amp;#039;s pay me now vs. pay me later, I&amp;#039;d prefer action now, if the alternative is another Depression. Is it? I don&amp;#039;t know that either, but there are an awful lot of people, not just hysterical ones either, throwing the word around.
