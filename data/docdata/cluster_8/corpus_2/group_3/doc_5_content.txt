Would I be better off sticking to Barclays or going to the B&amp;amp;amp;B?                      I presume that you mean &amp;#039;save&amp;#039;, rather than &amp;#039;invest&amp;#039;?    The Barclays product at 6.3% would be valued at around 21,008 in one year after basic rate tax or 20,756 after higher rate tax.    The B&amp;amp;amp;B one at 6.7% would be valued at around 21,072 in one year after basic rate tax or 20,804 after higher rate tax.    There are fixed rates available which offer better rates than either, e.g.  http://www.moneyfacts.co.uk/searches...chresults.aspx
