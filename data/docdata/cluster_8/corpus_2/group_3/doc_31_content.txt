I am happy to take part in a discussion but I cannot stand being called a liar when the evidence is there on the screen for all to see. If posts have been taken down, that is not my decision.                      Yes I did.  I will maintain that truth.  You, my friend, are a liar.      And yet you threaten me with libel.      And yet you look down on people.      You have no integrity.
