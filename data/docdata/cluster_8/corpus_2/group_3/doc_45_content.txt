Does no-one else find it strange that Lloyds TSB, one of the banks allegedly &amp;amp;quot;capital rich&amp;amp;quot;, need to go cap in hand  to the Govt for 7bn when its in the process of trying to acquire another bank, HBOS??      Are Lloyds resorting to using public money to fund the acquistion of HBOS?...  i.e if it doesn&amp;#039;t have the capital the Govt requires then it should be asked.... would Lloyds not be better oiff consolidating its own position?      Surely something isn&amp;#039;t right here??
