Unless you have a bona fide contract or CBA that specifically states otherwise, yes. Increases are not required by law in any state.      The ONLY exception is if minimum wage is raised by the appropriate legislative body and you are earning under the new minimum.      The economy is tanking and pretty much all employers are having to cut the budget somewhere. Would you rather lose your increase or your job?
