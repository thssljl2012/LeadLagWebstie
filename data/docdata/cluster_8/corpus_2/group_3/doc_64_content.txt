 My wife and I have a mish mash of pots. 2 old company pensions, one with the Pru, one with Fijitsu, a frozen Barclays, a current Barclays, a current Scottish Widows, and finally 2 pension pots that we had to make paid up due to a change in circumstances with what was Allied Crowbar.      We have 5 years to go before encashing and I wondered, with the stock market being so low at the moment, what would have happened if we we had to draw our pensions right now during a crash?
