We won a Tramp from this company on 1st Sep and was told it would be available by the 1st Oct! We never heard back from the company and all of my info on the purchase had dissapeared from my account! I contacted our bank NAB and filed a dispute, i have just recieved a letter to say they can&amp;#039;t help me as the transaction was done properly????? Of course it was done PROPERLY i was purchasing something (well i thought i was). Ebay and the bank pretty much blow.....i know i won&amp;#039;t be using ebay again!!!! Hope you all have better luck than me.
