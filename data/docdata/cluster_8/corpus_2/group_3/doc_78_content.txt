They&amp;#039;re a team of people that sit around and work to get our money back - tracing &amp;amp;quot;missing&amp;amp;quot; people, dealing with any legal aspects, etc.     I&amp;#039;m not 100% sure how they managed to recover it all, but I imagine some of it must have been claimed back by stating the payee was a knowing party to fraud - I mean, I can&amp;#039;t imagine you could find 19k+ of things to spend 250 on in such a short time. I&amp;#039;m guessing it was organized in some way.
