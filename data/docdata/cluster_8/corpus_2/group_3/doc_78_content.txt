 ----------------------------------------------------       Please spare a thought for those still trawling through this thread for information on their savings.         There are two other threads for socialising:           Kaupthing Edge Interest and CHAPS Fee Refund Discussion                 http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.html?t=1238923              Kaupthing Edge Survivors Reunited                 http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.html?t=1239933            Hane a good day. Ill be popping in and out during the day.  [/quote]         Thanks to Bigg for this and  sorry  to be a kill-joy. Personally I did not enjoy my extra hour&amp;#039;s sleep(less) night for worry over the whereabouts of my missing life savings! Proabably I&amp;#039;m not the only one.........          Please don&amp;#039;t get me wrong I do very much appreciate all the support from those now re-united with their savings.         But, if we are to be taken seriously and expect support from Martin and Dan, this thread needs to stay on topic.             CHAPS on the 8th to Barclays - still missing
