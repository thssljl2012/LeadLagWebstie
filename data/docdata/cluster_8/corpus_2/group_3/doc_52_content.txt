 I&amp;#039;m an AA97 contract in Arizona.  Your experiences are very similar to a dozen or more scratch Tica friends of mine.  Year 3 is the most difficult year, when the monthly PBP bonus really drops.  I&amp;#039;m very thankful for the AA97 contract, started scratch, travel every year, nice scorecard, growing by 700 P&amp;amp;amp;C year, and make more than I ever thought I would.  That being said, I probably wouldn&amp;#039;t take a scratch Tica position if I had to do it all over again.  I know of 10 scratch Tica agents around me that are paying over $3k month rent and a staff person or two.  Easy way to go broke if you&amp;#039;re not hitting the PBP carrot.      Greenman, enjoyed reading your posts.  Proud to have you as a fellow SF&amp;#039;er, we&amp;#039;re in different markets but you&amp;#039;re doing the right thing by running your Agency as a business and not giving in to the desires of AFE&amp;#039;s/C&amp;#039;s.      Best of luck
