  That&amp;#039;s really helpful - thanks for your detailed post.       I have an update as well - two days after my call to Barclays to complain about this on my mother&amp;#039;s behalf, today she received an additional cheque for 50.  Whilst this is better than nothing I intend to pursue this further having read your post ninja-lewis as this still seems inadequate compensation.       If anyone else has any other top tips, they would be gratefully received!       Thanks to everyone who&amp;#039;s taken the trouble to reply so far.     Cheers  W
