 well at this point in time i have my money secured in the net bank savings account (an account only accessable via the internet or phone) from the commonwealth bank, as i have always been with them      as for making changes any time soon that won&amp;#039;t be happening, as it will be plans i have in mind for the coming years, not months.      i am looking into the first home buyers grant at this stage, but what i had in mind is purchasing a home to rent it out, and use the rent money to pay off some of the home.      im just toying with some ideas for the future so keep the advice coming guys thanks
