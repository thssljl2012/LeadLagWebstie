 Morning People!!     I have a couple of questions this morning..     I am going to cancel my direct Debits today in preparation for the BR. Even though I have no idea when this will be, I dont want to book anything in with court till after 15th when DH has been paid and I can remove myself from bank account.     Will DH have to come with me when I go remove myself??      Most payments are not due until the middle end of next month is this ok cancelling them now?     I am not going to cancel car insurance (tho I think last one has just come out) or my mobile - its only 15 a month and I rarely go over and DH would go livid if I took kids out with no phone. Is that ok not cancelling them?     I have moved my Child Benefit to the joint account, should I open a basic account now or wait till after the BR?? One of my biggest debtors is Barclays so I presume I need to go to co-op?     Dh is happy giving me money but to build credit up again I presume I need a Bank account??     Oh and last one!! I think LOL!! I have seen a few posts where the OR / SOA ask why you are in debt, a Lot of my debt is old resulting from the &amp;amp;quot;father&amp;amp;quot; of my first son deserting us when he was just born straddling me with mortgage and bills then when I returned to work childcare on top with no maintenece etc.. But some of it is a lot newer from when we moved into this house and I was signed off work after maternity leave with PND... living expenses etc     then some of it the really new stuff is stuff for the house.. we basically thought my husbands overtime would cover everything and furnished a house but it hasnt       Will the recent stuff look bad on me and slap me with a BRO?? I am dreading that.. because we spent money thinking he would get enough overtime and he didnt just overspent??     Im hoping the older stuff regarding the sperm doner will help       Thanks
