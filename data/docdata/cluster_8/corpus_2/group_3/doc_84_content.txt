It is a pretty common practice among insurance companies.                      That may be, but it still does not make it right.  Heard on the news this morning that AIG is planning another one of these retreats.  When asked about it, a spokesman from the Justice Dept. said it was not illegal.  I miss the old times when people cared about their fellow man and not just about themselves.  I watch 1st graders everyday push and shove and &amp;#039;slug&amp;#039; it out all day just so they can be first in line.  I guess they are just livin&amp;#039; what they see.
