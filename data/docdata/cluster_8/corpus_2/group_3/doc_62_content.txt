         Hi All,   I visited this site a few months back for some advice as I have recently had my wage cut quite dramatically as the company I work for are suffering due to the current economical climate and it was the only option for me to keep my job. I am expecting to be on this lower wage for at least the next year, but then hopefully it will start to increase again and I will also hopefully qualify as a solicitor in 2010/2011 at the latest (im currently a trainee) and so then my earning potential should increase dramatically, so hopefully I wont be in this position for a great length of time, but it is starting to worry me now and so I want to do something about it before it gets out of hand.  I initially wrote to my creditors and asked them to accept reduced payment, a couple of them have and have also frozen the interest but the big ones (loan with Barclays of 22k and card with MBNA 3K) wont freeze the interest and are hassling me nearly every day for payment. I simply cant afford to pay them any more!  I have been in touch with CCCS and started a DMP with them, ive just received the paperwork today. Can anyone who has been through this before give me some advice as to how it works and whether my creditors will actually accept the proposal from CCCS? Im quite nervous as I can only offer all of my creditors 250 per month split over 30k worth of debt. Im just a bit worried if they threaten legal action or dont accept the proposal from CCCS.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks.
