         took out a loan over the phone from barcs in 20003, 6000, they added ppi to the loan without even advising me, i signed the paperworks without properly reading it or knowing the meaning of a word (premium loans) , 2yrs later upon checkin the situation of my loan by a personal banker that i was advise i had ppi..wanted to cancel but couldnt was told it was added on the loan and if i did, i would have to make a new application and they also told me that i would probably have to pay a higher interest rates and was told there was nothing i could do now.. after hearign about all this PPI dispute in the media this year, ive ask barclays again that i was unfairly sold this ppi, they promise to look into this, and 3months later return and said to me that they had not wrongly sold me the ppi and i knew what i was buying?? any advise on how i can deal with this situation? any advise on how i can sort this with barclays?
