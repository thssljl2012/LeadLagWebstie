I can tell you from experience that the CBA will charge you $35 to attempt to recover DD funds, and you will be made to pay whether they recover your funds or not.    Unless you acted virtually immediately (i.e. within a couple of hours), your money will have already been transferred and the bank will be unable to have it returned without the account-holder&amp;#039;s permission (like they&amp;#039;re really going to give it!).  My advice is to save your money as the banks can&amp;#039;t help you now. I suggest that you visit a solicitor for a fixed-fee consultation (about $20 for 30 minutes from memory) and see what they have to say about your chances of recovering your money using alternate methods.  Personally, I think the Qld Police On-line Fraud Squad is as good as anything currently operating in Australia, and that would be my very first port of call.
