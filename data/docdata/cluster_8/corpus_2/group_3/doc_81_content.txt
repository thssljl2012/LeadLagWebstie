  Hi     I would advise anyone who wants to make Cash deposits to their cash ISA - BEWARE.  Their T&amp;amp;amp;C (Article 2.2) states that you can make cash deposits to ANY UK barclays branch.  This is not the case.  I have been turned away several times by my local branch.  i complained to Customer services via email and wanted an explanation as to why their T&amp;amp;amp;C said I could pay in via cash deposit but ONE branch in particular would not accept my money.  In fact the branch staff said they were &amp;amp;quot;not prepared&amp;amp;quot; to accept my money!!     After 8 weeks and several emails on my part - I finally received a reply (the grammar and spelling was awful).  But it basically said that each branch could at &amp;amp;quot;their discretion&amp;amp;quot; accept cash deposits as they did not have access to information on an individual&amp;#039;s ISA.  Therefore, they could turn me away.     In this day and age of computerisation, I defy any banking authority NOT to have access to banking records!     I was not looking to pay in large amounts and the attitude of Barclays has disgusted me so much that I am transferring my ISA to NATWEST.  I checked with them if I could pay in cash and they said yes, no problem.     Think Barclays could do with assistance in writing their T&amp;amp;amp;C.........     I too await with baited breath as to how long and if there are any mess ups with transferring out of Barclays.......
