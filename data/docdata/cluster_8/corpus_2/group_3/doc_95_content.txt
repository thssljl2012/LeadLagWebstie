 For littlies you can set up a bank account under yours but in their names and it is in trust for them. Because of that you can declare that it is for them and you don&amp;#039;t have to declare the interest on that account on your tax.    Your bank should be able to set it up for you.    BankWest have a children&amp;#039;s saver account which gets 10% interest however I have our kids with Westpac as that is who I bank with and they have bonus saver accounts which get pretty good interest. _________________ Snug (33)    DH (35)    DS8 4.6.99, DS1 21.6.06, DD 28.5.08    Current Prams: Black &amp;amp;amp; Strawberry Zapps, Grey and Denim bases for Cameleon with Red, Off-white canvas and Damask Tin Whistle toppings, First Wheels City Twin Black with bassinet
