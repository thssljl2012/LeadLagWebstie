lol^^    this story sounds weird i am willing to bet there was more to it than just that.  I mean why would the agent have to see the ravine and everything else if there wasn&amp;#039;t some other problem to begin with? i don&amp;#039;t know but if they really wouldn&amp;#039;t cover him becuase of that i definitely will never deal with them, but as of right now im still on my parents insurance lol.
