          Im in the middle of getting mine, Not enough cash at hand so I need one for college and decided to get it on AFS and may 40 a month for 36 months (exact length of my course, college bursary you can take care of that LOL), just waiting for barclays to accept it the have to wait for them to insert a 250GB 7200RPM and an apple remote. I went for the base model MBP should be plenty enough for the adobe suite. Cant wait!!!      I hope Barclay accept my Finance agreement or Ill get my mum to put it on her card and pay her instead. Im getting a MBP no matter what!!!
