What a horrible way to explain the situation. So apparently, de-regulating a market that was rightly regulated before had nothing to with it? So there is no greed on Wall Street and they did nothing wrong?      Government wasn&amp;#039;t just promoting home ownership. What does that have to do with anything. What a copout! As I far as I remember it was the private sector and their shoddy commercials promoting home ownership.      This whole mess began and ended with de-regulation. PERIOD. What was AIG doing in this whole debacle, they&amp;#039;re an insurance company? From 2002 to 2006 is where you start from? This stuff began in the 80s and really hit big during the Clinton 90s! Doesn&amp;#039;t anyone account for hedge funds who are really the ones that need to reigned in?      Give it up. It had nothing to do with government intervention. In fact it had everything to do with LIMITED government. Your ideology is broken and is shown for what it is. Predictably, your ilk scapegoat the government each time.                      Why did Firstline bother to ask questions if he was just waiting to attack the first answer?  Seems to me you were only trying to look for a scapegoat that was not in your democratic administration.  It says it all when you&amp;#039;re willing to vote for the same &amp;amp;quot;ilk&amp;amp;quot; this time, too.  Why bother talking to people like you?  You were ground in your opinion when you posted this.  You probably only posted it to inflict doubt in favor of your corrupt party.
