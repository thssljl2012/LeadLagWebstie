The economy is very, very worrisome... Mostly, I&amp;#039;m irritated with the politicians for not getting a bill passed and done.  It&amp;#039;s infuriating when politics get in the way of doing things for the country, and now is not the time for that to happen.  I understand that many people were reluctant to support a bill that would cost taxpayers money, but if they delay too much longer people will lose much more than they would have with the original plan when banks fail and then when the many companies supported by those banks have problems of their own.  Hopefully something will get passed very soon.      Fortunately, the crisis in the financial markets doesn&amp;#039;t affect my family as much as it could have.  Six years ago my father was an employee of Merrill Lynch with insurance at AIG and a house (which no longer exists thanks to Ike) in Galveston, TX.  Now only the second one is true.
