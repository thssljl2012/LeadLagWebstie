The difference between the UK and US bailouts was that people in the US had a say in the matter, wheras people in the UK read about it in the paper.      As for who is to blame for all this.  Blame the Fools (Greenspan and Brown) who dropped interest rates to 1 or 2% after 9/11, left them like that long enough for a whole lotta people to take on debt that they might just be able to repay if interest rates stayed as they were, or if the price of their house kept going up.     Then these fukn clowns realised that inflation was getting bad (doh), turned up the heat so that the interest rates jumped from 2% to nearly 5% in one year.  Guess what happened.  People who could afford to meet a $1,000 monthly instalment found themselves having to pay three times that for a house whose value had not increased.  In fact, so many houses were being repossessed that the houses that were now going to cost three times more to pay off were worth half of their original value, so even repossessing a house wasn&amp;#039;t going to get the banks their money back.  Cue anarchy when the Hedge Funds who had bought these repackaged debt instruments to hedge their more risky bets found them to be even ore risky than the bets they we supposed to protect!  Cue massive insurance claims putting the likes if AIG out of business and the rest, as they say, is history.      It was not the fault of people who were lured into taking on mortgages by devious loan companies at rates of interest that increased at an unprecedented scale.  The fault of this mess lies squarely on the shoulders of Alan Greenspan and Gordon Brown, who put economic growth before stability and now their house of cards is collapsing.
