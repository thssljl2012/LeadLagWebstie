    You ought to be happy, CF - President Bush has been the most effective mole as President the Democrats could have asked for.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   He has expanded Federal control of education by raising Federal funding from $33 billion in 2000 to $93 billion by 2006 - reduced under the Democrat congress back to $68 billion.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   Health and Human Services funding has expanded from $359 billion in 2000 to $709 billion in 2008.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   Treasury&amp;#039;s budget had jumped from $390 billion to $520 billion in that time - before this new $700 billion in funds Treasury is going to own and administer.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   He&amp;#039;s renationalized FannieMae, and nationalized FreddieMac - and nationalized 80% of the world&amp;#039;s largest insurance company, AIG.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   All while driving his Republican administration&amp;#039;s approval levels down to 25% - effectively gift wrapping all of this massive Federal expansion, this massive Federal infrastructure up in a gigantic bow to be gifted to Barack Obama and the landlside majority Democratic Party after the election in 2009.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   I don&amp;#039;t think any Democratic Administration could have ever achieved this level of government growth for the Democratic Party - but Bush did it.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   Are you happy about that?
