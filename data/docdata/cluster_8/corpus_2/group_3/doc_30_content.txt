When I first started with SF,I started with a scratch agent. I had no experience, the agent got me licensed and started me at 1500/ mo  salary and my commission was $45 per home, auto. Renters $15. Life was one months premium. After I was there a year. After he got his contract, he decided to change the compensation schedule to 2,000 salary and 2% on al P/C lines. I was transferred to another scratch agent and helped train him and the other staff members he hired. When I left there I was making $2330/ mo  salary and 7% commission on all P/C, 2 months premium on life, and $100 on health policies, $100 per bank loan. You are required to sell alot of life. Aug, Sept, and Oct is Life Promotion Month. You better meat the quota on life on your first year or you might as well hang it up.  That will decide whether you get your contract or not.  Good Luck
