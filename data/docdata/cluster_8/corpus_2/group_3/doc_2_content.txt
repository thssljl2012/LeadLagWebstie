  Nothing here..the advisor just gave me the sort code and account number on the phone, cause she couldn&amp;#039;t open the account when I was there after asking questions, filling forms for almost an hour. But afterwards, nothing arrived, no welcome letter, no single paper. I did went to the branch to check the account. The casher told me that the account was in my name. I will go down to the branch to check again when I have time now you mentioned.
