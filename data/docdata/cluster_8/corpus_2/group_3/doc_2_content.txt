Great book.......will help you inform your customers.      Consumers need this book badly!  Suggest it to your customers.      I also recently finished reading &amp;amp;quot;Vulture Culture:dirty deals, unpaid claims, and the coming collapse of the insurance industry&amp;amp;quot;      VERY enlightening book......and AIG is mentioned LOL...SUPRISE!!         The Good Hands book has a glossary of terms in the back and I love this one.  First......HOW MANY of you guys have heard insurance adjusters tell you &amp;amp;quot;they are paying the bill?&amp;amp;quot;  I&amp;#039;ve had a Farmers adjsuter tell me &amp;amp;quot;he owns the check book&amp;amp;quot;......WRONG!!!!!!!!      Insurance reserves are like tax dollars...IT IS OUR MONEY!      Here&amp;#039;s a definition regarding this....       fiduciary principle - The standard governing how an insurer should behave while exercising its control over the fund of premium money it collects to pay legitimate claims.  By accepting its customer&amp;#039;s premiums, the insurer agrees to hold this fund of money in trust for the benefit of its customers, and to pay all legitimate claims from that fund.  Because this fund belongs to the customers, and NOT THE INSURER, the insurer has a duty to pay all legitimate claims promptly, and not to withhold payment unreasonably.      That was worth the price of the book.      Get them both, cheap, at Amazon.com
