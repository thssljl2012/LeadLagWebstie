 Opened the ISA in branch on 3rd Nov, which was showing on Natwest Online Banking the following day.  Handed in 2 transfer forms - Icesave and Barclays Tax Haven.    Just noticed that the Barclays Tax Haven ISA has disappeared from my list of accounts in my Barclays online banking today... so presumably a cheque is on it&amp;#039;s way to Natwest!       Lets see how long it takes for the money to appear in the Natwest ISA!       As for Icesave, God only knows if and when that will ever arrive!
