    Mark Gunn: Louisville&amp;#039;s B-96.5:       Vicky:           Mark Gunn: Louisville&amp;#039;s B-96.5:    What you&amp;#039;re not seeing is that I harbor no ill will against anyone nor is racism    eating at my soul. It&amp;#039;s shaped the way I am and think. Because of that, my life    has been relatively successful. What you also have to understand is that there    isn&amp;#039;t a Black person in this country who can walk around with blinders on when    it comes to dealing with racism.       The issue is much more complex than    &amp;quot;forgive and forget&amp;quot;. As long as it still exists in the workplace (Kroger just    recently lost a 12 million dollar judgement against Black employees earlier THIS    SUMMER) Housing and Insurance (Nationwide lost a huge lawsuit within the last 10    years because of it&amp;#039;s racist practices) and of course your everyday garden    variety racist (James Byrd&amp;#039;s dragging death in Texas, The Jena 6, the Diallo    case in New York) we have to be PAINFULLY aware of what goes on around    us.      Like I said, it doesn&amp;#039;t eat at me because I have healthy, loving    relationships with people of many different ethnic groups. I try to judge people    at face value and give them the benefit of the doubt until they do something    that causes me to think otherwise. I live my life in as positive a way as    possible but I&amp;#039;m not naive enough to think that just because you don&amp;#039;t talk    about the big elephant in the room, it isn&amp;#039;t there.          Again, I am not saying racism does not exist, I just think there is better ways to handle it. I just don&amp;#039;t think people should use it as an excuse to hate, self pity and failure. I think you have to rise above it. Not forgetting it, but learning from it.     As long as it continues to exist people are going to fight against it. What a lot of Whites don&amp;#039;t seem to understand, and there&amp;#039;s a brilliant documentary that CBS did, is that the reaction we have to it is not one of self - pity, and a lot of do well IN SPITE of racism. The hatred you feel from some Blacks can be attributed as &amp;quot;The Hate That Hate Produced&amp;quot;. THAT is as real as it can get and yet NOTHING has really been done to address it. It&amp;#039;s not enough to say &amp;quot;rise above it and move on&amp;quot;. It HAS to be addressed and it seems that people are deathly afraid of a &amp;quot;blacklash&amp;quot; if you wil, because they&amp;#039;d rather avoid the entire issue as if it never happened, rather than deal with it and put it behind the collective American conscience.   I don&amp;#039;t think that people are &amp;quot;deathly afraid of a blacklash&amp;quot;, I think our generation had to deal with this at a very early age and moved on. The younger kids todaydidn&amp;#039;t see what we seen when we were their age. So they don&amp;#039;t want to deal with it and thats understandable.  I think people have dealt with this and done so for many years. I don&amp;#039;t want to deal with it and my reasons are, I already did growing up, bringing it up will hurt more then it will help(my opinion), its a skipping record, and last but not a small one, I don&amp;#039;t want to deal with it because it didn&amp;#039;t have anything to do with me. Other races had to deal with racism and they&amp;#039;ve moved on. I think thats why the racism has pretty much disappeared for them. People change as they get older, see thing differently, have a lot of things to be sorry for and just want to move on and leave the past where it belongs, in the past.
