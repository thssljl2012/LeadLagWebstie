Perhaps the press hasn&amp;#039;t named Reid as the dork he is....I&amp;#039;m honestly not sure.  That is what he is though, the facts are overwhelming.   Nevada deserves better.                        I give you an opportunity to demonstrate that you speak truth.  You return the garbage opinions of a right wingnut.  That is stupid.       Bush is often a liar.  Victory in Iraq is a concept that cannot be defined.  Virtually every insurance company is on the brink of bankruptcy.  AIG made it twice.  White flags - more utter nonsense.       Sorry cow.  Reid is an important asset to Nevada.  And those who don&amp;#039;t realize it are simply stupid.        There is a whole lot of that stupid in right wingnut circles.
