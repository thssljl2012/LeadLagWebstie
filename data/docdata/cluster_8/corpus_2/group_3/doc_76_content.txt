 Greenman,     You have the right idea: get your contract and then really run your agency like a business.  If you can make a reasonable return on additional investment, spend the money.  If not, be patient and grow yourself to prosperity.  I did just that, getting by with one staff until I could afford two and now three.  And, of course it is easier to sell more life and bank with more customers.  You&amp;#039;ll get there and you&amp;#039;ll be glad you hung in there.  I, too, enjoy running the show and taking care of customers!  It is a good life.  I just hope they treat TICA&amp;#039;s better in the future.
