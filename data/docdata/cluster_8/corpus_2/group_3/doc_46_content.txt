And oh, janis, I get the insinuation and your point already with three dots.  No need to use six dots for ellipses.  I don&amp;#039;t like it when people don&amp;#039;t punctuate properly either.     I hear what you are saying, and no, I didn&amp;#039;t make this up.    Why not check to see if there&amp;#039;s a Barclays next to a Santander on Passeig de Gracia, if you have so much time on your hands?  I&amp;#039;m pretty sure that I got that detail right.  If so, I&amp;#039;m going to remember other details.    Believe me, I&amp;#039;m very detail oriented.  And quite intelligent, if I may dare say so.
