  The differance between the Monarchy of France in 18th century and 21st America is oppressed masses will lute the bank instead of use the gilloutine on the elite.  The peasasnts in France could not vote out Louis IX, but Americans can vote out congress Nov 4th.  The history of France will give clue a where America heading if they dont watch out .  Just be calm the meltdown is almost over and the mass can start to clean up the party.   Some Ceos will be given Buddy to make with when this is all over and Lehman Brothers traders did break SEC laws and AIG insurance thing becomes more unraveled the FBI will be pretty busy busting people involed.  Will get thru this America been there before the hangover wont last forever.
