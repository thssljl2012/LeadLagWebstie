  Went into Barclays Bank just before lunchtime, I asked her how long from the time a chaps payments reaches them to them doing their &amp;amp;quot;manual check&amp;amp;quot; would they link it in to my account, so that I would be able to see it online? The girl informed me that 2.30pm would be their cut off time, that it would have to reach them by then???? When I asked the other day via telephone they told me 5pm?? It looks like most banks are good at not informing their staff the SAME information.   So going on that it would have had to &amp;amp;quot;hit&amp;amp;quot; my account by 2.30pm, it&amp;#039;s another day that is not looking hopeful for me.....  Has anyone got their cash today?
