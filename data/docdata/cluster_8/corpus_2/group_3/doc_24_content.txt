I know we&amp;#039;ve heard it all before but I really feel that this time it&amp;#039;s true.     Also, did I detect some slight conciliatory tone in ING update today?     Good luck to everybody over the next few days -     *I do feel we are nearing the end of the road*             CHAPS left KE 8/10 destination Barclays still not received  CHAPS fee refunded 24/10  personalised &amp;amp;quot;held up email&amp;amp;quot; 29/10 a.m.  phone call to say money on its way 29/10 late p.m.                      SorryInvestor, will keep my fingers crossed and send out positive vibes, to be honest they can&amp;#039;t really keep getting it this wrong, so I am feeling positive for you.  Roll on the 3rd!
