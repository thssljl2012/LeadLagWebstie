 Well I&amp;#039;m taking this Natwest overdraft and credit card as a way of sensibly managing my money which I know I can do, and have done so far since uni started. The debt with barclays was a bit stupid, but if I didn&amp;#039;t have these credit facilities with Natwest then I wouldn&amp;#039;t be able to cope. Are you saying I don&amp;#039;t deserve these? Just because most people with bad credit histories are repeat offenders (posters are saying that I will do the same to Natwest and seem to be giving me this impression) dosen&amp;#039;t mean I am. I&amp;#039;ve only had a credit file open for 9 months so give me a break! I know I&amp;#039;m in control of this situation and have learned from the one with Barclays and it would be a very stupid thing to do the same to Natwest. I had a bad credit rating even before the debt with barclays - I couldn&amp;#039;t even get a Vanquis or Aqua credit card! I have checked my credit file again and Barclays haven&amp;#039;t written anything on it about the debt, but it still says I have an adverse history when I calculate my score. The reason I brought this topic up in the first place was as to why Natwest give me credit facilities with a poor credit history.    Banks can have court orders against an individual who owes them money through the court, by having assets seized and from deduction of wages through the court. I&amp;#039;m in a temporary overdraft limit with Barclays now anyway and I&amp;#039;m just waiting to hear further from them.    ~Scott~
