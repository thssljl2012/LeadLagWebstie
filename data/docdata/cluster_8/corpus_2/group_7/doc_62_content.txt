 But it was bought by Bank of America. (They were my first credit card, while in college. I went over the limit while overseas and then had trouble paying it off 30 some years ago, but finally did.)  I just use Working Assets for internet connection bill and pay it every month.  My mom talked me into getting the Costco American Express, because she got money back on all purchases, even Gas.  When my partner last went to town he was surprized there were no lines at the costco gas pumps, then found they no longer were taking ATM cards.  What the Fuck???   I haven't had the American Express card for a year yet, but so far they say I will be getting $33 dollars back on gas, (5%).  I have had good credit for years, even though I have not been full time employed.  Good luck folks, ADW                                Donate to DU and give valentine hearts to your friends!
