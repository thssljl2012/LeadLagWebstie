If we are going to lay blame for the economic meltdown, let us be accurate. The problem started with a bill passed during the Carter administration to promote neighborhood developement. This bill was used during theClinton Administration to force banks to makes loan to people who they knew couldn't or wouldn't pay them back. As a matter of fact, as stated by a former Bank of America Loan Officer, then Attorney General Janet Reno told lenders that if they didn't make loans to a certain number of bad applicanats (including illegals) the A.G's office would tie the lenders up with such an investigation that they couldn't continue to do business. The natural time delay for bad loans to cause trouble meant that the meltdown came during the Bush administration so naturally his enemies jumped on the "Blame Bush" bandwagon.  To be accurate, the meltdowon was started, promoted, and caused by the "Dumocrats" who then tried to blame their opposition. The sad thing is that many innocent people all over the world have been hurt by the stupid action s of these people.
