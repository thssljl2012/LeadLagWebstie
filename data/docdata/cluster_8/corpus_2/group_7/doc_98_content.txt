Hello socialism!                           Lol, we just spent $700billion bailout (350left) with Few trillion debt guarantees and  another $2trillion emergency loans to the banks by the Fed. Now that was total waste of money when most of that money went to the pockets of "investors" including the investment banks that got us into this mess.       At least this stimulus will have some impact on unemployment. The housing market is dependent on employment more then anything else. I think $500billion going to buy toxic MBS/CDO/CDS would be better spent by giving the money to the homeowners to pay the mortgages, that's coming up next by our Treasury paulson twin Geithener who seems dead set on following the inept policy of Bush and Paulson.       There is no justice in the world. The crooks keep their jobs while everyone around them gets fired. I wonder what innovative product they'll think of next. And I have to wonder about the asset inflation (oil, gasoline) we had in 2007-2008 orchestrated by investment banks... was that to cause massive inflationary pressure on wages etc... to stave off the deflation in housing.           http://news.yahoo.com/s/bw/20090213/...b4120034085635            Quote:                         Some from the industry denied a foreclosure problem existed, including Sandor E. Samuels, at the time chief legal officer of subprime giant Countrywide Financial. They vowed to continue selling loans with enticing introductory rates as well as those requiring minimal evidence of borrowers' income.  "We are going to keep making these loans until the last second they are legal," Samuels later told a fellow participan t.                               Quote:                         Asked about his role at the summit, Samuels confirmed in an e-mail that he "did speak -- formally and informally -- about the performance" of subprime loans. But he declined to elaborate.  He now works as a top in-house lawyer for Bank of America, which acquired Countrywide in July 2008 .      A major reason financial institutions and investors are so determined to avoid modifying loan terms more aggressively has to do with accounting nuances, say industry lobbyists. If, for example, a bank lowered the balance of a certain mortgage, there would be a strong argument that it would have to reduce the value on its balance sheet of all similar mortgages in the same geographic area to reflect the danger that the region had hit an economic slump. Under this stringent approach, financial industry mortgage-related losses could far surpass even the grim $1.1 trillion estimated by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS - News) in January. A desire to postpone this devastating situation helps explain lenders' intransigence, says Rick Sharga, vice-president of marketing at RealtyTrac, an Irvine (Calif.) firm that analyzes foreclosure patterns.
