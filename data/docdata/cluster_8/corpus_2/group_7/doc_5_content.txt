          I guess I could of pointed out that you used the same "mark to market is the problem" to defend AIG at $30.  Still think that was the problem or maybe the market was right after all?   B     Could you maybe dig out that post to refresh my mind about exactly what I said? I don't recall offhand if I talked or not about mark to market when I touted AIG. I do recall suggesting selling covered calls when buying AIG as insurance and that turned out to be a good idea, the covered call part.  I seriously doubt that I would advocate mark to market for AIG and not for others. But who knows, maybe you have a better memory than I do. Go get the post and we can then argue about it.
