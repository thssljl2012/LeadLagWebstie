Bank of America, you know, the bank that received a bailout because of the housing mess. That bank was the biggest offender of giving mortgages to illegals (most who walked away from their mortgages and can't be found) only requiring some id number no social security # or income verification. This is just another area where the middle class are paying for illegals on top of schools, hospitals, etc. Also on the job boards, 3/4 of postings require you to speak Spainish. That leaves me out.     Royko wrote:     &lt;quoted text&gt;That Miami sun has fried your brain, James. Democrats and Clinton were responsible for getting rid of the Glass-Stegall act that limited banking activities and investments for decades. Democrats were also responsible for pressuring lenders to make home loans to minorities and others who had no visible means of paying off those loans. Thank the Democrats for creating the housing mess that triggered this recession. Hispanic voters, responsible for most of the illegal immigrants in America (their friends and relatives), vote overwhelmingly Democrat. The Democrats have fought tougher immigration laws for decades, figuring they will turn all those illegal immigrants into Democrat voters when they finally give them citizenship. You want to stop this recession? Ask the illegal immigrants what they are going to do to clean up our economic mess, since they wanted to come up here so badly they would break American laws to get here and stay here.
