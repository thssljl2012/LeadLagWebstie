                  I live 10 minutes from NYC and you really don't have much to worry about. NYC is not like it used to be (80's!!!) I recommend using your debit card for everything and like maybe $20 on you. You can bring extra cash to keep where you will be staying in case you lose your card or something. If you are with a major bank like Bank of America, Chase, Wamu, Wachovia...they are all over the city. So are ATMs. You can use a debit card for just about everything. Even cabs take credit/debit cards now with no minimum! HTH!   I barely carry cash anymore!
