They may not be Christian either in the strictest sense of the term, but they think they are, and so they are in a looser sense of the word, the one where we're allowed to identify ourselves as whatever we please and form relationships accordingly.       He probably doesn't even know what conservatism is, but he has no problem denouncing "ACORN" and "liberals."             I came into the thread and somebody with 1 post count said something stupid, followed by Dr. Girlfriend saying something equally hysterical and insulting in return.  I don't really care about the first person, I don't respond to people with 1 post like that.  I do respond to idiots like Dr. Girlfriend who try to expose all that's wrong in her little world only to act exactly like everybody she hates.  It's comical and deserves to be called out.    And yes, I call out stupid neocon trolls all the time, look at my post history if you want.  If you care that much.
