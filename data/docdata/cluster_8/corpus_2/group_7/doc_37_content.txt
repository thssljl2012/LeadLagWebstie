I'd rather give a good CEO $20 million a year rather than Brad Pitt $20 million for 6 weeks of work. I don't see Obama attacking Hollywood. Take Motorola. What is it worth to have someone come in a help them survive this storm and thrive?$20 million is CHEAP. It's just another thing where the liberals are 180 degrees off.     Out of all the Obama as commie rants here, yours takes the case.  Obama is not telling all banks in the US to limit executive compensation. He is telling the banks whose very survival depends on GW's bail out money that they have to limit executive pay.  The government has nothing to say about Brad Pitt's pay because Brad Pitt is paid through private market success. Likewise, the few banks that were not on the verge of collapse: Chase, Bank of America, The Northern Trust, will not be subject to any limitation.  The socialism as it were, came in the form of the government bail outs. It is wholly fair for the government to tell the banks that would not be here but for the bail out money how they can spend it.
