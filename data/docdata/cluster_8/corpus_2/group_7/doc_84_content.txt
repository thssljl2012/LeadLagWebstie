   Judged:     3     1     1       Obama what an idot. When the companies need the most help he comes up the this hair brained ceo pay thing.   OK, we are talking about huge companies, lets say I am the best out there, the creme of the crop of CEO's. I can go to work for a company which did not need a bail out for 2 million a year or I can go to work for AIG, the largest insurance company in the world for 500,000 a year. If anyone needs the best CEO then its AIG. That is just not a hard decision I take the 2 million and AIG gets some CEO who will settle for less money cause he is not any good and the successful companies don't want him.  Old saying, you don't always get what you pay for but you do have to pay for what you get.
