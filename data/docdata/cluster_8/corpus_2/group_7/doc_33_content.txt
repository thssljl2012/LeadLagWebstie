 intelligent guy, and he GETS IT!!  Every time I turn around it's just ANOTHER big mess with ANOTHER inside the Beltway back scratcher!  I've been fighting Bank of America for FOUR LONG YEARS over fraudulent credit card charges... up to $9,000.00 now and I was REALLY thinking we were gonna get a little help for us peons! After hiring a lawyer and trying everything in the book, I'm finally taking the advice of another Du'er here... calling Senator Bill Nelson about it.  But I really don't think it's gonna help in the end.  I called them today to thank them for their NFL Extravaganza and told them that even though I was only an hour away from Tampa, I was unable to make "the party!"  I need them to "show me the money!"  Seems NOTHING works anymore!  I don't think Partisanship will ever end, despite efforts by Obama.   It's getting a little nightmarish regardless!  So I say, why don't we just go after BFEE and blow the whole thing wide open!  Am I correct?  Didn't Reich leave the Clinton Administration early?  Bobby Kennedy, Paul Wellstone &amp; Robert Reich, at least they have/had a spine!
