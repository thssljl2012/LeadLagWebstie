So we should not "LOAN", and I stress "LOAN" these companies money? We have given more, as tax payers, to companies like AIG and Bank of America than we will "LOAN" to GM and Chrysler combined. We need to become a country of builders and doers, instead of consumers and users, again. What is wrong with helping two companies that directly and indirectly employ over 1,000,000 (yeah that's one MILLION) people. It isn't like we are giving them a handout; it's truly a hand-up, since it's a LOAN... Get over yourself and buy a car that keeps its profits here in America i.e. not Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mistubishi, Kia, Mercedes, Volkswagon, etc. As for the capitalism excuse; it's dead just ask the Chinese whose Government readily bails out any manufacturer to keep the upper hand on the U.S. economy.....
