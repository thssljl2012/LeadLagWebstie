Quote:               Also also besides the point, I don't fully buy the "We need tons of money to attract the best talent".                No offense but that is because you have worked in unionized environment for too lone.     In the real world "pay" is probably 99% of the time the deciding factor as to which job a person takes.  They may take "experience" over pay in the short term because they think it will result in more pay later.     But in most cases Citibank is not going to attract over a top executive making $750,000 by offering him a job capped at $500,000.       Quote:              That is used a lot to justify government pay raises, and quite frankly, it seems to attract the greedy more than the passionate.               Gov't is different.  There is no competitive measuring stick for gov't so they live in a completely false economy where we can only arbitrarily set their job worth.     In the business world if I have a currency who makes millions a year in profit for the company, the best way to determine what he is worth to a company is to allow companies to bid for his labour.  I know several "traders" who make more in bonuses then the CEO of their companies.  Because they are worth it to the company.       Quote:               Who would you rather hire to run your company, someone only doing it for the money, or someone who wanted the job because they loved it?              Stupid question in the real world.  I would want to interview everyone and hire the best. The guy who would help the company make the most profit.  If I was lucky enough to get a guy who wanted to work for the luv of work and no pay then great. But if the best guy was clearly a guy who would make us millions more in profit then anyone else then I would not want to have to turn him away because I couldn't offer him the $750,000 that would get him because I was limited to $500,000.
