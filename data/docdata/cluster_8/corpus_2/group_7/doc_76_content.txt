 You'd think they would have told him that when he called, though.     It's been posted that customers that PIF are actually a loss to the CC companies (rewards and maintenance I believe). I've not seen the #s, but the source was pretty credible       No telling how many people who PIF each month will never even notice and they'll increase their revenue that way.     And I guess if they ones they lose are a loss, then so be it.     Julie
