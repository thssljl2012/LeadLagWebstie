The Citibank Citibusiness Gold card earns 1.25 points per dollar (transferable to QF on a 1 for 1 basis in blocks of 10,000) and requires a minimum income of $35,000 per year. From the details on the QF website, transfers to QF will continue as per normal after 31 March (as seems to be the case with most points earning business cards in the market).     More details can be found at  CitiBusiness Gold - Citibank Australia  - I think there's a cap of 80,000 points per year.
