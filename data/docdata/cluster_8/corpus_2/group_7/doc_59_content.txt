Yes, this is happening to me.  The amount is wrong so I'm working with TYN to resolve it as Citibank relies solely on TYN's numbers for the 1099-MISCs.  If you compiled your points via credit card, you will have no worries.  This is only happening to those who opened the MMA or similar product to get the bonus points.      Regards,   Chris
