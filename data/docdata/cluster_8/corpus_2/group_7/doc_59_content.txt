 This morning I got a cold call from a somebody asking if a certain person was my neighbor. I said yes before I realized what was happening. They then expressed concern about this person and wanted to know how to contact them and then added that they were calling from the Bank of America. I was totally shocked and disgusted when I realized that they were going to use me to try and shame my neighbor. I did an online search to see if this is an illegal tactic. I found the "Fair Debt Collection Practices Act" and read the whole thing. Turns out it is legal for a debt collector to contact a third party to verify a persons location but becomes illegal if the subject of debt is disclosed. This kind of sleazy tactic must have been around for a long time but these days seems especially abusive of personal rights. The best remedy I can think of is to give up credit cards altogether but at the very least do not patronize Bank of America.
