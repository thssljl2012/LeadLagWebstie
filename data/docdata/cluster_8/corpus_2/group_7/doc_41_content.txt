We are with CBHS which is Commonwealth Bank Health Society, only because my Mum used to work for the Commonwealth Bank. For $80 per fortnight we are cover for everything bar maternity. It will also cover our 3 kids when they are born in June.      Used to be with NIB for basic singles cover which i think was $50 a month, cant really remember to be honest.
