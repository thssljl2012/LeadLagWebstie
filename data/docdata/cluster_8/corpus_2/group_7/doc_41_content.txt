The ballast in going to run you another $200-$300, but I have not looked it up.        You're back up to $500+ with tax and you don't have a fixture to put them in yet.      I would still prefer a linear lighting source for a garage because a person will have MUCH less shadowing from a long light source than from a compact source.  Anyone doing work in their garage will understand how nice it is not not have shadows and not have to worry about where they park to get the best light when they pull into the garage.   Even if the efficacy is slightly higher from and induction lamp, you can't get the light to where you need it from a compact source so the result is using more fixtures to get the light distribution that works.        I don't know if a person could realize a payback using the induction lamp/ballast.  The payback in this type is still going to be in LABOR savings on high ceilinged, hard to reach places.   How 'bout over a pool that has to be drained and scaffolding erected to change lighting , or on radio transmission towers?            EDIT:  I just looked up the ballast for the 150watt Icetron lamp you listed.  $599.00          That gets you to almost $900 for one set.                                     You seem biased against induction ltg - for whatever reason. That's OK -Most folks do have a problem accepting new technology.  You seem to rely on quicky Google searches in lieu recognizing search engine shortcomings and doing a little bit of info mining and research.  Didn't you read the Macy's story I provided?        An important item to remember is that the predominating load in operating costs for all businesses is the cost of human resources (that is variable resources), and for production facilities, maintenance is about 20 to 48% of the variable costs (depending upon industry) Now --just think how better off GM would now be if they could have terminated 50% of their maintenance people because they went to induction ltg - instead of having armies of highly-paid UAW gray shirts pushing plastic carts of fluorescent bulbs and other illuminating junk routinely through the production floors. Hey, benefits/medical/retirement all factor into CBA analyses.  The lifespan of ind is 100,000 hrs - that is 11-1/2 years!!!  For your average resident garage bubba whose crowded two-bay man-cave also doubles as storage for a child's BigWheel, the ROI may not be so attractive, but for many others it is.        Many orgs, including GSA are moving towards ind ltg and LED ltg as part of recent DOE research/directives that will be strongly supported by the Obama admin.  I welcome the new tek since it not only tames the Hg problem, but also tames the foreign oil problem as well as the melting arctic cap problem.
