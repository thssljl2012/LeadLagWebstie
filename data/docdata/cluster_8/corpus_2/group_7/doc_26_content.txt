thanks for answers.  I don't know the reasons, but Bank of America had no problem lending to me.  I have no doubt you are right, that the kicker is my salary at the present.  I am a an Anesthesiology Resident so maybe this had something to do with the risk of the loan, and working with an agent directly helped.  Not sure.....but thanks.  I am happy with my loan, just curious about refinance and learning a thing or two.  Thank-you all.
