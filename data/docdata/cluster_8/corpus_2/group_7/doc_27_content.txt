All the  banks  were telling me to go with a secured card. Honestly, its a rip off. Youre basically paying money to get a line of credit. That money is locked for a long time (the minimum i saw was 2 years) before they even consider extending you a real line of credit. And if you fuck up and dont pay, it still trashes your credit score and you "lose" your deposit and probably your card priviledges.      My advice would be to wait it out, apply every 3-6 months with a different company. Eventually you will get one of those "Pre-approved!" applications in the mail, fill it out and send it in and youll get a real credit card.      Oh and stick with a major bank or reputable lender/business.                 Pre-approved does not guarantee you'll be approved.  I took credit cards applications for Citibank and people would call up all the time bitching about how they'd received pre-approved applications and been denied.
