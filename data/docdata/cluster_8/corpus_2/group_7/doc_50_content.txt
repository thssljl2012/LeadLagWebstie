  I love how people give words and the things that they represent whatever attributes they please and then act like those attributes are denoted by the word and thing itself.    They gave money to ACORN? Is there supposed to be something wrong with that above them giving money away? Is there something about "ACORN" that I am missing?    Oh yeah...some sh i t about some of their members taking it upon themselves to file false registrations to no actual political effect in order to meet personal quotas...because I'm supposed to care...and I'm supposed to have a shorter attention span than to get all that rather than "FALSE REGISTRATIONS OMG HORRIBLE ORGANIZATION!!!"
