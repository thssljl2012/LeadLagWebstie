Google the Glass Steagall Act of 1933, which was repealed in 1999 overwhelmingly by BOTH parties, and you will see why it was in place originally, and it only took 5 years to destroy several banks and brokerages in business for hundreds of years.     Letting Lehman brothers collapse locked up the credit market and sent AIG -- THE WORLD'S LARGEST INSURANCE COMPNAY -- into bankruptcy.  The cost to America of fighting World War II was $288 billion dollars. Correcting for inflation, in today's economy that works out to about $5 trillion dollars.  As best I can figure, so far between the bailout and the stimulus the fight to save America's economy is about 40% of the cost to fight World War II.
