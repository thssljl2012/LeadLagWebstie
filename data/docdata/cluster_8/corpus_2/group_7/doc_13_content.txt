theslothuk,    The Bad Bank idea stinks. We have lots of bad banks, why would you want another one?    The idea is this. They want to subsidise some of the big banks in the UK, USA and elsewhere, because they are bust.    But they want to do this in a way that doesnt look like a subsidy. Because, believe it or not, there are good banks out there. And those good banks are going to have to pay a lot of tax to bail out these bad banks, how fair is that?    We are back to moral hazard. What is the point of being sensible with your lending decisions if the result is you have to pay more tax to bail out those who lent recklessly and paid themselves big bonuses for doing so.    I dont underestimate the politicians ability to try something as dumb as this, and if they want to I am sure that they will succeed. Well when I say dumb, it is either that or they are being corrupt and trying to help out their rich buddies, I will leave you to decide which.    All this nonsense is just delaying the inevitable in my opinion. The best solution is for the government to get out of the way, guarantee nothing, and let the bad banks collapse, no taxpayer bailouts.    Things will be bad for a while, but then things will pick up again as the good banks are able to grow and our businesses can expand again.    So Bad Banks, bad idea.
