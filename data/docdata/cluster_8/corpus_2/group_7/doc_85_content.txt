 Here is how it would work.  Someone with a home that is too much for them to handle would trade for a lower priced home.  This would give the people involved a chance to have a home that they can afford and help the foreclosure rates go down.  Of course this may give someone a chance to get a "better" or larger home but that would have to be agreed by the banks involved.  If the trader of the lesser home can show they can make the payments of the bigger one then why not do this?  Just trying like you to be creative.  I lost my home because we had an illness in our family and I nor my husband could not find a full time job in Florida.  The taxes and insurance is what tipped the balance for us and also the fact that our bank (CitiBank) wouldn't even discuss any payment options.
