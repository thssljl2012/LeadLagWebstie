I have a feeling by this time next week, there will be something really big happening w/ AIG.      To the guy who suggested nationalizing AIG....FUCK THAT. That would drag down the insurance industry worse than AIG already has. Trust me when I say that no broker is going to want to compete against the govt. when it comes to insurance contracts.
