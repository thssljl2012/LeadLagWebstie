  My goal for today is to rid myself of Bank of America. They have been screwing with me, also blathering about the 'crisis'. I noted last week that I don't have a crisis, they do. Each day I read two types of stories about Bank of America. One type is like this one, horrid business practices and a clear desire on their part to make thier problems into 'our' problem.    The second type is Bank of America complaining about lack of money, begging from the goverenment, buying things with our dime.    Enough.
