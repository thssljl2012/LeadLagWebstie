Everything about this documentary looks awesome. I caught wind of it a little over a week ago and have been eagerly anticipating it.      Frontline: Inside the Meltdown      "FRONTLINE investigates the causes of the worst economic crisis in 70 years and how the government responded. The film chronicles the inside stories of the Bear Stearns deal, Lehman Brothers' collapse, the propping up of insurance giant AIG, and the $700 billion bailout.  Inside the Meltdown  examines what Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke didn't see, couldn't stop and haven't been able to fix."     The official press release at the link above concludes with this paragraph:        "Many Americans still don't understand what has happened to the economy," FRONTLINE producer/director Michael Kirk says. "How did it all   go so bad so quickly? Who is responsible? How effective has the response from Washington and Wall Street been? Those are the questions at the heart of    Inside the Meltdown .  Here's a preview:                     Here's an excerpt from a review in  The Baltimore Sun :           PBS' 'Meltdown' stands out among economic   crises-documentaries        David Zurawik,  The Baltimore Sun , February 17, 2009           One of the finest hours of nonfiction TV that I have ever seen in 30 years of writing about the medium, "Inside the Meltdown," a   Frontline   documentary from producer Michael Kirk, chronicles a week in September when the economic gurus lost   their way and Americans started losing their jobs, much of their life savings and their trust in Wall Street and Washington. It is the first of five   documentaries that Kirk will be producing for  Frontline  on the economy and how we got to where we are today.           "Watching the events of that week, it felt like  9/11  all over again," Kirk said in a telephone interview last week. "But because we don't have an image of something like a   plane crashing into a building, I don't think anyone understands."           After Kirk shared that feeling with David Fanning, the executive producer of  Frontline  told him to do what it takes to explain the   crisis to PBS viewers. "How did it all go bad so quickly? Who is responsible? How effective has the response from Washington and Wall Street been? Those   are the questions at the heart of 'Inside the Meltdown,'" Kirk explains.           The searing and illuminating film takes viewers inside the boardrooms with players like former Treasury Secretary  Henry M. Paulson  Jr., as   he made mistake after mistake in that time of crisis last fall.      I know what I'll be doing come 8 p.m. CST tonight.
