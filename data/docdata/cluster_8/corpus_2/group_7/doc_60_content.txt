Inavan, no I don't want to go back to trading chickens for goats and NO I don't want all the banks to fail.  I didn't want all the banks to fail here in Texas back in the 1980's either, but they did because they were INSOLVENT.         Guess what?  It was very, very painful but we survived.  in fact NCNB, which we commonly know now as Bank of America, swooped into our market like a jackal feeding on the bodies of the dead bank bodies laying around all over the SW and they made a FORTUNE doing it too.  We used to jokingly named them "No Cash for No Body (NCNB)" because all they did was buy up the good stuff for pennies on the dollar and suck off our deposits to make loans in other parts of the country.         These banks have already failed.  The only question is whether we will allow the SAME PEOPLE who created this mess to stay in power while they bleed profusely and rely on the taxpayer's good will to keep their doors open, or do we swallow the bitter pill to take them down, strip off the good from the bad and get it ALL back into private equity hands JUST LIKE WE DID WITH THE S&amp;L's?         If we did in the late 1980's with the BIG regional banks and S&amp;L's what we are doing today with the sacred money center banks, we would have NEVER had a recovery in the 1990's or 2000's.  We would still be nursing along a bunch of brain dead zombie banks jsut like Japan.         The sooner we get on with reality, the better off we will be as a nation and a world.         :)         thread start
