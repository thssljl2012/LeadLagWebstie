  The right wing loonies are  still  trying to make a boogeyman out of ACORN? Heh. As usual, the loonies are wrong. Bank of America didn't give ACORN money. They gave money to a group called the Community First Fund:     http://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/i...eases&amp;item=7564     The Community First Fund has nothing to do with ACORN, by the way:     http://www.commfirstfund.org/about-us/     I'm not exactly thrilled with BoA giving out bailout money that they should be using to salvage themselves, but a little fact checking from the wingnuts would be a refreshing change from their usual nonsense.
