  I have a funny story to go along with this....       My husband and I have a MILITARY banking account through Bank of AMERICA! For two weeks or so we were having trouble with our account (deposited money was not showing up from a federal check). So first I called because I am the calm one! LOL I didn't get anywhere because the person on the other end did not understand me, not mind you I am from the boon docks but the only damn language I speak is ENGLISH and although I am from podunk I do not have an accent that is anything really. Well I hang up wait a few hours call back, got someone who still could not understand me, this went on for TWO DAYS! Finally my husband called now mind you his fuse is about - that long. He once again gets someone who does not understand English. He says in a loud tone, and angry manner to the person on the other end of the phone, "WHAT THE FUCK I THOUGHT I CALLED BANK OF AMERICA I MUST HAVE MISTAKENLY DIALED BANK OF "FOREIGN COUNTRY"!" (He did not use the words"foreign country" but I don't want to "offend" anyone)       But that wasn't the end of it, he called the 1800 number for regular accounts (because you have to call a "special" number for military accounts) and guess what, a fucking English speaking person answers the phone, before the guys gets any of our info, my husband asked him are you American the guy laughs and said "You have a military account don't you" ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?
