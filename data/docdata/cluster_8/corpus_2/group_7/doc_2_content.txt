Then they bailed out AIG....... "That's strange. What does aninsurance company have to do with this crisis?" The answer?? Among other things, AIG INSURES THE PENSION TRUST OF THE UNITED STATESCONGRESS!! No wonder they got bailed out right away! So much for with the people ---- let's protect our future, said all ourSenators and Congressmen.......nice to see where their loyalties lie.     AIG like many other insurance companies were buying the mortgaged back securities. Since the the government (Fannie and Freddie) were largely responsible for the housing collapse they had little choice other than bail these companies out. We can thank the administrations of Carter - the author of the Community Reinvestment Act, and Clinton who abused CRA for votes by forcing banks to make more and more bad loans...oh and least we forget the brilliant Barney Frank who was is still is in complete denial over the gross mismanagement of the F &amp; F twins.
