 Yes, Citibank does have a relationship with Banamex, that is how I paid no fees on my first trip and Citibank did not charge an exchange rate.            Thanks for the suggestions, I could feasibly open another account, but I wanted to see if someone would say, "yes i use bank X, and I have no fees". Seems that is unlikely so I will go with with my Citibank.
