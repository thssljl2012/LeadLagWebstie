Unless he tied your hands behind your back and pointed a gun to your head to make you take out a loan you could not repay, a credit card...or a dozen...you could not be responsible for, a risk in the stock market or an over infated wage nothing happening here is his fault. Here's the poop people, WE DID IT TO OURSELVES!! That is those of you with subprime loans. Too many credit cards and a lackey at your own job that you were paid waaay too much to do. Get a grip and take the blame where it belongs. Square on your own shoulders. If you need to blame someone, look in the mirror.     Because if they could not blame bush they would not be able to work their base into a frenzy and steamroll thru all their proposals. Why accept resposibility for your own mistakes when you can use blaming someone else to your advantage.  Notice how the majority of the posts blame bush and the republicans without ever providing details and if they do it is usually incorrect. Most consist of broad, generic accusations that never contain any specifics.  An example is blaming phil gramm and the republicans for bank deregulation which they claim led to the mortgage mess even though it was actually clinton who signed the Gramm leech bill. Also, it was heavily lobbied for by his former treasury secretary rubin who wwas a senior exec at citibank and used it to help destroy the bank while making over $100 million in bonuses.  Or saying that bush gave his wall street buddies billions in bailout money.  1- most senior wall street execs are dems  2- bush did not give anyone a dime- congress voted for it  3-The firms did not get a handout as the money was in the form of loans and warrants meaning the gov't receives interest and may even profit from its investments down the road.  4-one of the 3 main architects of the bailout was Tim Geithner as NY fed prez. If the plan is so stupid then you must believe that obama picked an idiot (and a tax cheat) to run treasury.  Democrats are blaming bush for his reckless spending and tax cuts but then cheering the stimulus plan spending which also contains tax cuts.
