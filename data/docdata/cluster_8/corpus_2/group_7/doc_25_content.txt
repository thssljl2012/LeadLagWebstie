i thought id make the point of $0 etc to show it can be done and i would be able to get off my feet quicksmart and straight away.      saying i got no car to flog or anything that i can sell to raise equity, i would go get a 20k credit card @ 12%, go purchase IP1 in capital city, with a 97% lend through CBA, which would be positive cashflow from day 1, and be 20% under market value.       go back a week after settlement and get it revald, and pull out as much as i can (20-40k) rerpeat the process.... at some point id pay off that initial credit card with a redraw.      not advice just showing how someone with nothing can get the ball rolling.
