        QUOTE (Converted Lurker &#064; Feb 17 2009, 09:16 PM)       anyone notice that the DOW finished at 7552.9 today and at the low on November 20th it finished the day at....7552.9       Amazing that innit. What are the chances eh?   So what do we think the talky talky stories will be to save the day? GM plans are so good Geithner decides to give them oodles and oddles of extra dosh to make them all better again? or....er.......Bank of America and Citigroup realise they're not insolvent after all? what else......oh, they'll think of something before the close tomorrow. Gives them nearly 23 hours.
