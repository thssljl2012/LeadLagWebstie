Or possibly you agreed to maintain a minimum balance when you opened the account. Call the bank and find out, be polite, explain your situation, and ask them to reverse the penalties. You'll likely be required to deposit an amount sufficient to restore a positive balance, so make sure you have a few bucks on hand for this purpose. I've generally received fairly good service from US Bank over the years, i'd expect they'd be happy to help you out.   ...unless this is the same bank you ripped off a while back, in which case they may be somewhat reluctant to deal with you at all...    CSS_Shadow(); wrote: Do they really think I am f***ing stupid enough to pay them!  FWIW, US Bank offers cheap overdraft protection in the form of an automatic line of credit. I made a mistake a while back, overdrew my account by about $600 and didn't notice for a few weeks: that mistake cost me something like $3. Of course, you do need a decent credit record to get this... which you won't get if you ignore a negative balance to gather fees and rant about it here instead of calling your bank.
