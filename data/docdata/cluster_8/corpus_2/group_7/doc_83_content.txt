Citibank told me, "Due to a high caller volume we cannot give you the service at this time that you need to refinance your home, thank you." CLICK      A LIVE person hung up on me.   The other two banks didn't even get my credit information; they just flat said that they can't do ANY refinances for anyone due to "Stricter lending regulations" enacted by Fannie/Freddie.  I didn't get get news from the place that I walked into either and sat down for two hours...      Yet, the schmucks down the street are able to live in their home; get a reduced mortgage mortgage and KEEP their 50" plasma TV, ATV's, Snowmobiles, MOTORHOME (only two years old) because they said they couldn't pay their mortgage anymore.      I AM SO EFFIN' MAD THAT I COULD REVOLT!    I couldn't do it on my own, but if there were a bunch of folks contributing to some civil disobedience due to us RESPONSIBLE tax payers and RESPONSIBLE credit holders being fed up with SUBSIDIZING the lazy a-holes that can't pay their stupid mortgage - I WOULD JOIN THEM.      I tried   (to obviously no avail) yesterday for almost 6 hours calling, talking to and even visiting various lending institutions to refi my 4br home and got the "Good luck pal" response from the nice ones and a plain old door slam or hang up on the rest.                      Don't go postal but I do feel your pain...the world seems turned up side down.  You can have your wish many cities are having marches this Friday "tea party".
