True that to number 2. I find people are too nice on the phone, even when they're mad. You're on the phone for God sakes, you can say whatever you want (whether you would like to or not is another story and discussion people). I've called people all names under the sun and reamed several new ones. Especially if they're in the wrong. Don't let a big company or corporation bully you. Speak to a supervisor immediately. If you can't get it resolved or they won't put you through go to a branch and make a scene.    I once told a bank teller I wasn't going to leave the bank until they cleared a check I was putting into my account after a lengthy discussion. I had security follow me around for a while but eventually got what I wanted. It's unfortunate but sometimes in this world you've got to be "that guy".
