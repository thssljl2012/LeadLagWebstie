  Citibank illegally transferred a colossal amount of money to the middle east on Friday.  we gonna just ignore this cause there's no link? that's why they wanted no strings, no oversight and no liability for the funds.  you don't think we are going to let a saudi prince go bankrupt do ya?   IMHO we must deeply look into govt and private dealings with the saudis(our enemy). they are not very good stewards of the world's wealth.
