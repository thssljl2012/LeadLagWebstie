Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex) has suggested that the Republicans have learned how to gain attention by being disruptive, much like the Taliban and says the GOP has the bluster of an insurgent band as they take on the Democrats and President Obama's Stimulus. Young Rep. Paul D Ryan (R-Wis.) claims the Republicans are standing on the core principle that suffered the most in recent years. And, get this, the principles he speaks of are fiscal conservatism and economic liberty! And to top it off, Rep. Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said that the Republicans are standing up on principle and just saying a resounding, "no"! These guys are nuts! They did not have the courage to say no to George Bush, but they now have the cowardice to blame their own economic mistakes on the Democrats and block progress in an attempt to make the President fail.     Sir the economy is not near ruination. We have had recessions much worse before and recovered. President Obama has scared investors. He scared them before he was elected by saying he would repeal the Bush tax cuts and increase capital gains tax. Do you realize it was the push of Fannie and Freddie government insured bank loans and the soaring home prices that urged risky investors to go hog wild with hedge funds? It was a combination of easy mortgages with zero money down, people buying and flipping houses, banks urged to put out more and more loans, hedge funds and packaging of toxic assets in with other loans to unknowing buyers that caused the banking &amp; mortgage crisis. Bush did not MAKE Bankers put together shady loans with hidden clauses that increased the interest rate one year later. Bush did not MAKE investors buy more and more hedge funds in a greedy attempt to make a quick buck. Bush did not MAKE real estate agents push the prices of homes higher and higher. Bush did not MAKE the Banks sell off sub-prime loans then use the money to get more mortgages. Bush did not MAKE the Federal Reserve Bank ignore warning signs and look the other way. Bush did not MAKE the Banks like LEHMAN, MERRILL, GOLDMAN SACHS and BANK OF AMERICA take huge risks, pay millions in salaries and bonuses, cook the accounting books, etc. Bush did not MAKE Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac cook their accounting books and present fraudulent documents to his staff.  Bush is just ONE person. He was very focused on keeping us safe against terrorists.  He cannot be everywhere watching everyone all the time.  The same is going to be true for Obama.  He will make many mistakes because he has little experience. I truly hope he has good advisors with all his decisions. It is only by them that he can know what is happening everywhere and if he gets bad information he will make mistakes.
