 If you have a Bank of America ATM, you can use the Deutsche Bank ATMs without an ATM fee, although of course you will have to pay the transaction fee of 1% to 3% of the amount you withdraw.             Just to avoid any problems, be sure to tell your bank ahead of time that you will be using your ATM in Europe -- and then be sure to take your bank's 24-hr fraud telephone nr. Two years ago I told my bank beforehand, but they still flagged my account for possible fraud. If I hadn't had their telephone nr I would not have been able to straighten out the problem.
