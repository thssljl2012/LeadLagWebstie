I think IMO this whole package is worthless and won't do anything to correct the problem. They need to just let it alone and let the whole thing correct itself.                        The problem is that this isn't a "market problem" I posted an article earlier about what the real problem is, and it is much larger than just a market downturn because there are external factors that are pushing this, and those factors are the derivatives that are being paid out in the tens of billions to hedge fund investors who were betting that the mortgage securities would fail, and when they did these investors just had to wait for their insurance policy to pay out, this is why companies like AIG got nailed and why there are so many banks that are getting killed, until something is done with these derivative payments then this problem is not going to go away because the banks and corporations are all turtling up while there are still trillions of dollars of derivative policies that are just waiting for more people to default on their loans thereby busting up another mortgage security.  The only way to keep this from happening is to stop the derivative payments or keep the mortgages from defaulting which means making sure that people stay working.
