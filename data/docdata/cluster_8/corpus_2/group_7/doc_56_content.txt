 This problem has been reported on other forums. Apparently the Mexican government are trying to prevent large amounts of US dollars being exchanged at banks since the US dollar is the currency of the illegal drugs industry and those are the people they wish to inconvenience. There is no problem exchanging any other currency (e.g. Canadian dollars) nor withdrawing pesos from an ATM using a U.S. bank card.
