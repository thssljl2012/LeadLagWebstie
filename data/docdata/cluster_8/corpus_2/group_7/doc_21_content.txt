   Judged:     2     1     1       Folks,  This is a very dangerous road we're traveling on. When the government starts dictating what executives make, it's only a matter of time before the government starts deciding what people in other occupations make. I know that Wells Fargo and Bank of America weren't interested in receiving TARP funds. Paulson made Wells Fargo and BofA take them. So now, we have two banks that are required to follow rules imposed on them. Wells Fargo and BofA were sound banks that did not need taxpayer dollars. Why did Paulson require they accept TARP funds?
