Today the market took another nose dive, but alas, that's another fact and you deal stricly in fiction. As for your constant state of joy, don't thank me; thank your dealer.     Letting Lehman brothers collapse locked up the credit market and sent AIG -- THE WORLD'S LARGEST INSURANCE COMPANY -- into bankruptcy.  The cost to America of fighting World War II was $288 billion dollars. Correcting for inflation, in today's economy that works out to about $5 trillion dollars.  As best I can figure, so far between the bailout and the stimulus the fight to save America's economy is about 40% of the cost to fight World War II.
