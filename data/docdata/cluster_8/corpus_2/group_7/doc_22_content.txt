lol, it wouldn&#039;t be much of an investigation. There are enough facts right out in the open that make Blago look like a saint compared to those scum bags. Throw in Waters and Reid also, as well as many more, all democrats. Obama should be on that list as well. He got more money from those evil scum bags than any other while he was in Washington.      The CEOs of Fannie Mae (Reins) and Freddy Mac (forget his name) perpetrated a crime more than 1000 times the volume of Enron, and infinitely more damaging, and it was just as purposeful. Those guys having not even been named in an investigation after what they did to the world economy so they could get their $90,000,000 bonuses for fraudulently representing those bad mortgage based securities as government backed is one of the greatest crimes in history, if not the worst. Compared to them Madeoff&#039;s crimes are minuscule.      The democrats being so stinking corrupt and owning the news media there is little chance there will ever be justice for this. Bill Clinton did so much that was public knowledge that should have landed him in jail it&#039;s not funny, but he had the press and no one could touch him. I guess Bush could have, but he just wanted to get along with everyone and not tear the country apart. I think he screwed up in spades in trying to get along with these guys. He allowed organized crime in Washington to go unchecked.      Republicans police their own, and no way would any republican get away with any of this crap no matter what they controlled.       Democrats have become a fascist movement and they will police nothing their people do unless they piss off powerful democrats like Blago did when he stopped tax increases. Screwed with the medical lobbies profits by getting drugs from Canada and so those politicians they give to, and the big one, he messed with the bank of America ... and the day after is when they took him in and started all of that to get him out.
