And who are these people?         Applying your same logic here defcon15 (cool user name I might add) you would think the folks at GM, Lehman Brothers, Wachovia, Citi, Bank of America, Circuit City, and so on would know how to run their business too.      I completely understand the point you are trying to make, but I have sat in a college classroom with professors who have been involved with all kinds of important stuff with the govt and fortune 500 companies and yes they are smart in some ways, but they are narrow minded and so stupid in many others, don't put so much faith in them to uncover the all important answer.
