It wouldn't surprise me if the cost of the mailing was covered by AIG which does the insurance.  Although I keep the confirmations, I see these mailings more of advertising for the travel protection plan than anything else.      If AIG isn't paying for the mailing, I'm sure the kickback DVC gets from them more than covers the mailings.
