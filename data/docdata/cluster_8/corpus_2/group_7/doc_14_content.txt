Most people would be without insurance right now as well... as the insurance industry would have collapsed after the fall of AIG           I admit there is a certain attractiveness in that scenario.. but I'm not sure its the best way to go for the nation                      It would have been painful, but this is why we have an FDIC, as for insurance, this is not the only company in the country. I actually think they would have found a way, most of them, we simply took the easy way out, as usual!      Just my opinion.
