A couple years ago, whilst working at Outback, I sliced up my thumb pretty good with a knife, resulting in an ER trip and some sutures.  Since it was a work-related injury, everything was paid for by worker's comp.  Even so, the hospital insisted on sending me a series of invoices, all of which were for... nothing.
