Yes the Kaplan diploma is exxy - hence why we don't actually have a lot of savings   We did have a term deposit but that had to go towards study.      Mr Sash has a BBus but still had to do PS146 and Dip Fip to allow him to give advice.      Most practices then want the Ad Fip, and then once you have done that study, and been a financial advisor for x years (2 I think) you can then start towards CFP qualification.      Rents here are about $350-$400 for quite a nice house in a decent area, but you can get a smaller and older house in an outer suburb for about $250k + (we are looking in the $300-350k range). You can get a new house in an outer outer suburb sub $300k.      Loan on $250k according to CBA current variable - repayments of $364.50 per week.      You guys need to come live up here
