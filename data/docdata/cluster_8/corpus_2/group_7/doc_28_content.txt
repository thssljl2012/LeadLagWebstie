Two years ago I was thinking of switching companies, but I did not want to spend all day getting quotes.  I just called up my current company and said that I have a quote from company XYZ for 30% less than the current premium and that I am thinking on switching.  They told me to hold one for a minute and then they said they could lower my rate 25%.  They where happy in that they where still getting my money and I was happy because I am paying less.  I did this twice with the previous insurance company I had and it worked both times.
