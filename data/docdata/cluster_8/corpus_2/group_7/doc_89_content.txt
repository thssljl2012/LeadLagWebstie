I just checked my bank account the other day, and I have -$150.  What the hell?!         I was looking over my account history over the last week and noticed what happened:  I had about $40 left in my checking, and I went to buy supplies that I needed for my trip to India in just a few days.  Later that night, I checked my online banking and noticed that I accidentally went over by about two dollars or so.  I also had charges from earlier that day pop up that I didn't show before, like a three dollar charge from Starbucks and five bucks at the gas station.  I got some cash out that I had saved, went to the ATM that night and deposited enough to cover everything.  I figured all would be good... right?    Wrong.    So later that week, I go to see how much I still had in my checking, and I'm at a negative balance!  And they were all from BoA's overdraft charges from the other day, which are for $35 a piece (!)  I didn't understand since I had been told before by a bank representative that as long as I deposit money in the same day as charges made, it shouldn't overdraft.  So I called the bank to find out why this had happened and to get it reversed.  Turns out, that each ATM has a cut-off time when they allow deposits to override negative charges.  What the ****?!  And every single ATM is different!  I was NEVER told about anything like this, and the lady said she would only reverse one of the overdraft fees.    I wanted to punch her in the mouth.  By reversing that very first overdraft fee, I had enough money to cover all of the charges listed on my account.  So technically, those additional fees shouldn't exist, right?  But no, instead of removing the actual overdraft fee listed on my statement, they just add it as a new line item under a "Deposit."  So those other fees still can exist.  They are sneaky bastards.    So I went and deposited the very little bit of cash that I had left to try and get as close to even as I could, and then today, there are MORE overdraft charges!  It doesn't even add up!  I've gone over my online statement so many times, and talked to someone on the phone, and it doesn't add up at all.  But they say there's nothing they can do, because they are only allowed to reverse one overdraft fee on a particular account.  Bull****.    This absolutely blows.  And this is less than 30 hours before I leave for India, and I have no money now.  And I have a small check coming in a few days electronically that was going to pay my bills while I was overseas, but now it's not going to be enough to even do that since a chunk of it will be to bring my account back to zero.    Moral of the story:  Don't ever trust Bank of America.  I'm ditching them as soon as I get back from my trip.  ****ers.
