 We have just been conned out of $41,000 by the Commonwealth bank in exit fees for selling our house at the end of the first year of a 5-year fixed rate loan. Because of the drop in interest rates, if the bank now relend that money it would be at a 4% lower rate (due to drop in interest over the last 12 months)... so... WE have to pay the difference
