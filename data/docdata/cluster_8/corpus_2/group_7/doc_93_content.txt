 It's probably the right thing to do from a business perspective, but I can't imagine it going over well.       http://www.examiner.com/x-2888-Worl...money-in-Brazil            Quote:                          GM to invest US taxpayer money in Brazil        In a move sure to ignite anger in the US, General Motors has announced that it plans to invest $1 billion of US taxpayer money into its Brazil operations.      In selling the steady stream of bailouts to the US public, both the Bush and Obama administrations have argued that American jobs will be saved or created by taxpayer-funded gifts to failing companies like GM, AIG, and Bank of America.      As of this morning, no US government official had a reaction to the news.
