The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 was repealed on November 12, 1999, by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act      The repeal enabled commercial lenders such as Citigroup, which was in 1999 then the largest U.S. bank by assets, to underwrite and trade instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations and establish so-called structured investment vehicles, or SIVs, that bought those securities. It can therefore be argued that the repeal of this act is directly responsible for the Global financial crisis of 20082009.      The year before the repeal, sub-prime loans were just 5% of all mortgage lending. By the time the credit crisis peaked in 2008, they were approaching 30%.       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass-Steagall_Act       The overturning of Glass-Steagall allowed lenders to charge whatever they want for interest. As we all know, there are many fools working in Washington.
