As long as that money is brought back to the US, or your a US citizien or business your going to be taxed. Why do you think Haliburton moved there US headquarters to Dubai in 07'. Regardless of where you made the money, when you file your US income tax, bz or personal, the income has to be reported. That money is not going to magically show up in a US bank, without it being reported, unless of course he is being paid US currency and carrying the cash back to the states and then dumping into a Safety Deposit box. I'm telling you something is extremely fishy about this whole story.     Have you worked in Iraq? My experience has been that if you earned the money in Iraq, it's not taxable. But if you earned it in the US, then it is.
