         yttire,   The problem with capitalism is that it assumes that those entrusted with capital will deploy it to the good of society.   I disagree. I don't care how anyone deploys their capital. It's their money, they can do whatever they want with it.  The "problem with capitalism" as I see it is that there is an inherent tendency for participants to take on too much leverage, especially during a boom.  Every period of prolonged recession has been the result of excess leverage proceeding the recession. The excess leverage allows participants to spend future earnings today.  So, I have no problem with a product like a Credit Default Swap, except for the fact that they were unregulated (that's why they didn't call it "Default Insurance"--call it insurance and there are regulations). If it was regulated like typical insurance, AIG would have needed capital to maintain a regulated coverage ratio in case of defaults, and they would have never been able to issue trillions of $ worth of CDS.  So, my opinion, leverage is the problem with capitalism.
