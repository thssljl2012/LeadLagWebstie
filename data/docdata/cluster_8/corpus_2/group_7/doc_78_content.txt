theslothuk    Think the two points are linked.  Based on the Bad Bank idea in America if the US Nationalise BAC it will probably become the Bad Bank. If this were to happen how it effects others is the unknown.  1) one arguement is that the Nationalisation of a major American Bank sends the markets into turmoil. All Bank shares fall and increases the likeliehood in the UK of this happening.    2) It does the opposite. It provides the American government with an arm to get more control on the Bad Debt situation. Other Banks rise on the back of it.    It's a difficult one to call and in all honesty I don't know which way it would go, but my gut is that if this happened could send further shockwaves round the market and could lead to a lot of Banks being Nationalised. Only my opinion
