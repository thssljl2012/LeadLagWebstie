Wait a second, that was AIG, wasn't it? The same folks who are behind so many of the annuities. Hmmm....                      It was the holding company of AIG and not the insurer themselves.  Has Vanguard dumped AIG as a VA vendor yet??

So if buying the annuity was about buying peace of mind for the next 50 years or so, well, let's just say I don't own any annuities.                     A pension is an annuity as is Social Security....             Quote:                         Seems to me TIPS may be one of the few actual safe havens out there which could give as close as possible to a guaranteed inflation-adjusted income stream over the long run. But that isn't exactly a secret, and right now they're paying a real 2.5% for a 20-year TIPS (auction on Jan 30 '09), which isn't quite the SWR we're all looking to lock in for the next 20 years... Still if I ever see TIPS real yields up over 3.25% or so I'll be tempted to buy in a meaningful way.                     Just wait until inflation comes screaming back after we dump a few trillion on the economy,maybe you'll have 5% or 6% TIPS.........
