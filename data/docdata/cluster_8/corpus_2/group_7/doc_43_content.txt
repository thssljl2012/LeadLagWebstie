I have began to really get mad at some of the banks that accepted the stimulus plan and didn't use the money for what they were supposed to.  There is going to be a congressional hearing on this at some point too.        The thing is that the banks that did this made the mistake and thought that they were untouchable.  They thought that they could just do what they wanted to do and we wouldn't care or do anything about it.  They were wrong!        If all of their customers stopped using them and started using banks that were good banks that didn't do the crooked things that other banks did then the bad banks would start loosing customers and capital.  If we pulled our accounts from them eventually it would hurt them.        I know that one of the Bad Banks is Citibank.  I had a credit card through them.  I am cancelling that credit card.  I have no more accounts with them but if I did I would move them to other banks.          I encourage you all do to the same.  If the American Consumer started doing this it would send a powerful message to those banks and tell them that they aren't untouchable and they need to do the right thing in these troubled times.  The stimulus package was not there to pad their pockets, it was there to spur economic growth!
