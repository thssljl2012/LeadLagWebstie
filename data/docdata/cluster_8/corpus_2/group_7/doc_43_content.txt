 Corrupt public officials and corporate scam artists should fear it, but I don't believe they should feel it. Not on the back of their necks.   A lot of them should end up in prison, however, after a proper trial and if convicted by a jury of their peers.  Clinton?  Fact: The supposed non-Republican, Clinton in 1999 signed the Gramm bill overturning the last remaining New Deal regulations on banks, leading directly to the derivatives scam-ology of the 2000s. Clinton's crew under Citibank-Goldman Sachs tool Rubin oversaw and helped pump his own era's bubble. He was a champion of the Reaganite neoliberal globalization and wage suppression strategies that caused income to be replaced by credit. Except for the ability to control the deficit, his admin fits seamlessly into the 28 year development that began with Reagan.   Two more key terms will suffice for now: NAFTA. Welfare "reform."  Geithner until a couple of weeks ago sat on the board of the New York Federal Reserve, pumping "liquidity" into the bottomless hole of a failed banking sector. Now he wants to set up TARP II to see if there's anything left to squeeze out of the taxpayers on behalf of the precious banks, before this strategy destroys the currency. This is not what we needed. You've got Nobel laureate economists and "safe" Democrats, no radicals, like Stiglitz, Krugman or Galbraith who are willing to try something different. Call on them, not on the Federal Reserve robots.  As for Obama, from me at least he gets the six month or even one-year pass, as he's  a) better than McCain would have been and   b) as a smart and possibly flexible guy, perhaps able to react to the crisis better than he has so far... Once it has properly reamed his middle-of-the-road band-aid measures and crushed all fantasies that it's possible to bail out the tens of trillions in bad bets made by the financial sector parasites. Once it's obvious the only practical solution is to let the plunder class go under and replace it with a national banking sector unencumbered by fantasy values of the past.  .
