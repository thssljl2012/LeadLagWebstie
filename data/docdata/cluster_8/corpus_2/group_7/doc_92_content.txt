 You don't provide your CC numbers. Just login info to your online acct. Like user name &amp; pw. If you do that now and look at it, you can see there is no identifying information shown. And you can't purchase or change anything to your account from in there.     I'm glad reading all those notices works for you but it doesn't for me. We've got 3 discover cards and 2 citibank cards and letters always get tossed into the "i'll get to it later" pile. This was just a suggestion for others who don't want to log into multiple places daily to get this info.     I did a lot of research and I'm sure others will too. Good luck with whatever you guys decide to do!
