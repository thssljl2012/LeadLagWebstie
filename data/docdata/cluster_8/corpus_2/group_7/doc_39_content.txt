The skill set of the people that work in Branches is pretty shoddy to say the least. Don't go into a Branch - it's  waste of time.      Apply on-line.. Lots of banks... good time to borrow. Don't let them screw you on banks. WHo is your UK bank with? Maybe they partner. Mine did went Suntrust / Barclays were linked - but that was 12 years ago !!                          I don't think the relationship between SunTrust and Barclays exists any more. I do believe there is a relationship between Bank of America and Barclays though.
