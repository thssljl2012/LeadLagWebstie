I have waited the 15 business days and haven't seen anything show up in the mail yet.  Is there cause for concern?  Or do checks take just as long to arrive as it seems ACH deposits take to hit your accounts?  Anybody have any timeframes for their recent check withdrawals that they can make us aware of?  That would be helpful, as I too am unable to get any kind of response from FTP's email support.                I requested a check on feb.2nd, approved on feb. 3rd, and got it today    ( feb. 9th ).    I'm in the U.S. and it was drawn on a U.S. bank. I don't know how it works in other countries
