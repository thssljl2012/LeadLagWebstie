In 1994, Obama was one of a team of attorneys involved in a lawsuit filed against Citibank (Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank) for "redlining" which forced lenders to lend in areas where borrowers had a history of foreclosures. Obama was directly responsible for banks lowering their credit standards and making sub-prime loans. ACORN filed, or threatened to file, hundreds of these lawsuits and then opened up a mortgage counseling division to help people with poor credit get loans.     Your really stretching, that was a local case in the city of Chicago and the case was settled in May of 1998 without any disclosure whatsoever on either side, so how can you possibly twist this into the current crisis ? You can't. So you take a little piece of something and make it out to be something it's not, if you can find something more that directly links anyone but Bush for this fiasco, I'm listening .
