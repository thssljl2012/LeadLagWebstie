Cam Muir was difficult enough to stomach when he was working for CMHC. At least now that he's with BCREA, the bias is transparent.  So by the same argument, since financial stocks are more than 50% cheaper this year than last, we should all go and buy Bank of America and Citi Group. He speaks of cash flow being greater this year, but go and crunch the numbers and any property would still be bleeding hundreds of dollars a month.  I think by now most of us can agree that many of the sales in the past few years would not have happened if the purchasers did not think prices were still going up. You take that out of the equation and only people buying for primary residence are left. At today's pricing, if you're a young professional couple and are comfortable with paying down a $300,000 mortgage over the next 35 years on a 700sf condo, go for it.
