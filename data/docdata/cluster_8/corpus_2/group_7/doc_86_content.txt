 Citibank lowered a limit on a MC card that I have from $15,800 to $2,400. Their reason was that I don't use the card enough. This is true, I almost never use the card. With a $2,400 limit I won't be using it at all. I'll probably just cancel it one of these days. I have plenty of other better cards. I agree with investor_bob_, people are far too obsessed with their credit scores. Pay your bills on time, don't carry balances and your credit score will take care of itself.
