                         Shouldn't have surprised anyone.    The last time I checked, banks receiving 'bail-out bucks' were not required to report how they used what they got - and then once asked, either refused, or couldn't. A couple of large banks were pointed out; do not remember which.         I know *our* bank has not requested, nor received a penny of those funds - even after Madoff - and I like that.
