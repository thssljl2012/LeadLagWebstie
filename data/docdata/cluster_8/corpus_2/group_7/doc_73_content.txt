Argue all you want, but I don't see you house going up in value right now. If you think you can sell for 600K try it and see if the market agrees with your appraiser. Until then everything else is just a guess. Based on your purchase price the  OFHEO  says your house should be worth about $437,000.  Bank of America  home valuation puts you in a range of $299,000 to $239,000.Yahoo Homes has you at 250,000 to 395,000 and your own assessor has your house valued at 302,536. I t seem nobody agrees with you. I wonder why this is.
