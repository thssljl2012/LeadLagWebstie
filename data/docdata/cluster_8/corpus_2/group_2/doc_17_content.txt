If AIG gets out of this the Fed will make some decent returns on their money.   Pay your premiums                       I don&amp;#039;t have an accounting degree and I saw this coming a long time ago. There was no way home prices could keep climbing like they were and I knew something had to break. When we bought our townhouse, later refinanced it and finally sold and bought a house we pressured by every broker to go with an ARM. It is always easy to look back and see what decisions you should make but it is hard to predict. Because I could foresee this mess on the way but I didn&amp;#039;t know if it was 1-25 years away I insisted that we would sign nothing but a 30 year fixed rate loan. In the case of the townhouse we would have been fine because we sold it before things got too bad. In the case of our house we are in now we would be facing an ARM reset here shortly had we listened to the idiot brokers. Instead we are sitting here looking pretty good as long we we don&amp;#039;t get taxed out or the heating bills don&amp;#039;t price us out.       I don&amp;#039;t quite understand how people can be dumb enough to fall for some of the lines that these brokers were trying to get you to go for but maybe it should be made a requirement for a 3rd party to inform the buyer. I never believe a salesman. He/She is just working for a commission and could care less about what will happen once you close or what is best for you in the long term.      The part that pisses me off the most about this stuff is the CEOs and other execs that will walk away at some point in time with Millions. Why are they making so much to run a company into the ground by poor decisions. This isn&amp;#039;t just a fact with this company but others from the airlines to car manufacturers. A golden parachute only helps the one wearing it. Everyone else is going down with the plane. It just sucks that it is usually everyone else that put the work into the place.      I don&amp;#039;t really see this as a political thread. It is more a discussion about what happened.
