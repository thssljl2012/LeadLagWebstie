 like with AIG. They happen to insure a lot of companies. If you get hurt on the job, who do you think pays for it? I got hurt on the job, and guess who our insurance company was. AIG. I was out of work, with medical bills for SIX months. They also do other types of insurance as well. They do auto insurance. Suppose someone who had AIG auto insurance lost coverage after they crashed, and they didn&amp;#039;t get other coverage, hit your car, and totalled it. Your insurance would have to pay. Guess who&amp;#039;s insurance is going up? Yours.   Yep, one way or another, we would all pay for it anyway. Everything that happens on Wallstreet affects us on Mainstreet.
