They included the FOS leaflet with this letter. I&amp;#039;ve not heard nothing since.         Is this a good sign or a bad sign?         Should I be contacting the FOS or just write back to Barclays to remind them that I am still waiting and have not forgotten about it?        Many thanks for your help.       I also received the exact same letters obviously with different dates, I contacted the FOS and have just received a response from them today to say they are sending Barclays details of my complaint and are asking them to deal with the matter, they say they (Barclays)should issue a final response within 8 weeks, if they do not put things right or i do not hear from them then i need to go back to FOS, here&amp;#039;s hoping!!                      Hi hun.  Blimey didn&amp;#039;t Barclays already have their chance to respond to you with their final response ?     I would contact the FOS and tell them you have already been through this stage and its way over the deadline dates.     In the meantime write back to Barclays and tell them as they have not responded you have already taken up the complaint to the FOS, send this by recorded post and you could always ask if they will reconsider and uphold your complaint within 7 days, and if you hear nothing and they still do nothing then continue with the FOS.  Enough is enough, but yep I would tell the FOS about what you have told us.     Have you been given a direct email contact ?  You could always ring as a quicker method.     Hope I have not misread this hun, its late, so apologies if I have lol.       All the best.  Di.  x
