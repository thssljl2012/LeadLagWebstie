I have only been in the country for just over two weeks so I doubt I have any credit history in Australia. Can anyone tell me how they went about getting internet and how they got round the credit check?   Thanks in advance,   IpswichGuy                        Hey there, we were told exactly the same thing - that we couldn&amp;#039;t get a contract without a credit check and since we&amp;#039;d just arrived in the country we&amp;#039;d probably fail the credit check.       We told them (3) to go ahead and surprise, surprise we passed the credit check. We have had a Commonwealth bank account for about a year so that probably helped. We&amp;#039;d also recently got our NSW drivers licence and signed up to Medicare but I doubt that would have been recorded yet.
