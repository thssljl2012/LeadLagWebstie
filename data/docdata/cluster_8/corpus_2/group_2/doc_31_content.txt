 CPN Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 3              Enron saga is far from over ........... I predict CPN class action saga will begin soon    The bulk of the settlements, $6.6 billion, came from JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Smaller amounts came from Bank of America; Lehman Brothers; former Big Five auditing firm Arthur Andersen and its defunct global umbrella organization, Andersen Worldwide; LJM2, a former partnership once run by ex-Enron finance chief Andrew Fastow to conduct deals with Enron; and law firm Kirkland &amp;amp;amp; Ellis. The only individuals to have settled for a collective $168 million were former Enron directors.    Facing a bankrupt company when the litigation was filed weeks before Enron failed in 2001, the plaintiffs pursued deep-pocketed banks that did business with Enron. Specifically, plaintiffs said the banks played as major a role in fraud as Enron by crafting and financing dubious deals.    While some settled for $2 billion or more each, three others &amp;amp;#8212; Merrill Lynch &amp;amp;amp; Co., Barclays and Credit Suisse First Boston &amp;amp;#8212; kept fighting. In March last year the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rewarded their tenacity with a ruling that rejected the plaintiffs&amp;#039; theory that the banks were primary players in fraud.    That ruling said that at best, the banks aided and abetted fraud as bit players, and as such could be pursued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, but not in private securities litigation.    The Supreme Court refused to review the case, so plaintiffs argued to Harmon that the three remaining banks are liable because they were so active in conducting deals with Enron and selling its securities that they had a duty to disclose what they knew about fraudulent practices.    Harmon has yet to rule on that argument.
