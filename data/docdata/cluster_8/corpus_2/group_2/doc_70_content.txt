I noticed Nationwide still taking monthly direct debit. I called them to find out that I have to call them to cancel the policy and they will take one more months payment. Is anyone aware of where this is fine printed ?     Thanks  Maveli                      It is in the policy booklet, i would also have thought you&amp;#039;d have received a renewal which would have explained it will automatically renew.    Here&amp;#039;s the link to the online policy book. See page 6.     http://www.nationwide.co.uk/NR/rdonl...008_lowres.pdf
