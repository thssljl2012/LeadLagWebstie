Dude..Its just the name...The same people who worked for Lehman are now working for Barclays and they will get the clients for FOREX for barclays.    Nothing will change...There are very smart guys up there..who have made millions and bailed out...    I dont know if you guys read and understood what credit derivatives and CDS are...If you do..you will kick yourself and say damm...wish i was in those guys shoes ..and made millions along the way...    I&amp;#039;m saying this again...THEY ALREADY KNEW IT COMING&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;It is what they say GAME OVER....the fallout...media frenzy..is the way the game ends and winner runs...    The next cycle of game will begin shortly..      Dude...It happened in America...They already figured it out..how to get in and how to get out...They never loose      We too did not loose either..we just missed an opportunity to make big money, cos we were not working for those companies      Some of the guys in America are paid to manipulate the market with billions and billions of FED money...We should envy those guys..what a job they have
