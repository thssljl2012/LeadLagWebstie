For a new AFE, their compensation is nowhere near that.  Maybe the old timers, but they have been cut back several times.  SF has trimmed the management levels quite a bit from several years ago and probably will some more, due to expense management and some of the issues that you raised.   What they do with the AFE&amp;#039;s isn&amp;#039;t going to change your contract though.  You guys are going to have to rally together on that one to get something done.                      Agreed.    The real issue is that the AFO&amp;#039;s are just irrelevant.  They  do not  represent us agents, and they serve no real function.  If they all  went away tomorrow, absolutely nothing would change in our offices.  Everything we need help with is a phone call away.
