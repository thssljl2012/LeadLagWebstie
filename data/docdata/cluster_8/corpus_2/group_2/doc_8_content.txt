For example, millions of people have invested in AIG and use their insurance services. If a big company like AIG fails many people lose their car insurance.       Well then maybe it&amp;#039;ll actually make people become better drivers knowing they don&amp;#039;t have insurance lol  I don&amp;#039;t like this plan and we don&amp;#039;t even know if its going to work.  And I think that just like the money we have spent on the Iraq and Afghan war, this money could be spent on something better.  But if that means asking the government to actually think for once instead of bailing out big corps then I think were all asking for too much.    Use this money to create a better model, a better america.  But I guess lend money to people who can&amp;#039;t run a business and IMO are greedy ****s, it&amp;#039;ll work wonders
