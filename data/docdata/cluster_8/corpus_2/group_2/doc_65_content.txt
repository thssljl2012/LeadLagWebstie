 NikkyWikky,     The amount you stand to gain from switching to NatWest depends on how long the transfer period lasts as well. If the transfer takes 4 weeks during which I assume the money doesn&amp;#039;t get any interest at all, you will be better off at the end of 1 year by 44.25.     The official guidance on the transfer time says 30 days. Is that 30 working days or 30 days flat? This would make a small difference to the interest lost ie 4 or 6 weeks&amp;#039; of interest. Whether its worthwhile or not depends on this little detail and the difference in interest rate.

Now is possible for me:     1. To transfer both lots into the NatWest Cash ISA so that i&amp;#039;m in the 9,000 to 14,999 bracket and so I get the 6.87% AER interest rate.     2. And is worth we doing this. Ruff cacluclation says i would be 6.21 better off a month (74.52 a year). Also, does any1 know how much i would use durign the transfer process, dont think theres any penalities.     Thanks Nik
