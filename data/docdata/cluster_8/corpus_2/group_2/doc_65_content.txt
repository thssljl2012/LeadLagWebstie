Please comment if you do not agree...                        That was a fair summary of the mechanics.      But big picture, you get closer to the heart of the problem (at least as I see it) in the other post, which references their mistaken notions of risk allocation.    Basically, everybody thought that they could take big risks because they were insuring against it.  The lenders sold most of their paper to securities firms and got fees for selling and servicing it, so they didn&amp;#039;t much care.  Investment banks got fees for creating the securities, so they didn&amp;#039;t much care.  The investors had insurance policies from firms such as AIG and &amp;amp;quot;credit enhancement&amp;amp;quot; from other investors in the lesser tranches, so they didn&amp;#039;t much care.    Effectively, everyone thought that they were able to pass the buck to someone else.  In isolated instances, that sort of risk management would have been possible, but it is simply impossible to insure against systemic risk to such a broad extent as was attempted here.      These things were not structured to survive bad case scenarios that sweep the market like hurricanes.   As is the case with hurricanes, such downturns occur with relative frequency, so it was foolish and irresponsible to plan as if the likelihood was next to nil.      Unfortunately, now we have to bail them out, otherwise we will only screw ourselves.  If they fail, we do, too.  Next time, we need to make sure that it is unlikely that they can fail, rather than pretending that we can simply fix it with an insurance policy or a hedge.
