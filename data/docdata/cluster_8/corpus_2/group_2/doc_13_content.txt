Yeah, we wouldn&amp;#039;t want &amp;amp;quot;verbage&amp;amp;quot; to get in the way of a conversation!    I hope you have a high opinion of your wife!      But, thanks for making this a conversation rather than an obfuscation of reality to merely promote a private agenda (that&amp;#039;s what I dislike about many of your earlier posts-- but, maybe I was misreading them).      There is not, however, a simple answer to your question, &amp;amp;quot;What is AIG&amp;#039;s primary business?&amp;amp;quot;  AIG is the 18th largest corporation in the world.        AIG started out as an insurance company.  AIG used to be a small group of people with a lot of money who made a lot more money by capitolizing on the insecurity of people, or groups of people, without enough money to provide their own insurance.  This is the basis for the Insurance industry.      Now, if we stop right there, some would say AIG&amp;#039;s existence was based on an amoral amount of greed by &amp;amp;quot;the rich&amp;amp;quot; to get &amp;amp;quot;more rich.&amp;amp;quot;      After almost 90 years of success, AIG has evolved into a multinational corporation of greed.  The CEOs and higher ups in the corporation have completely insulated themselves from financial harm (of course, the heads of AIG began their lives insulated from financial harm), and have moved from mere &amp;amp;quot;insurance&amp;amp;quot; and it&amp;#039;s inherent prospect of financial growth to outright speculation where those higher up in the organization could benefit from obscene profits while remaining insulated from the risk faced by  AIG employees and stock-holders.      If you want a 20 words or less definition of AIG, I&amp;#039;d have to say:      AIG is an organization designed by rich people to increase their own wealth by capitolizing on the dreams of those without the same financial security.                                         __________________        Blood IS thicker than water.
