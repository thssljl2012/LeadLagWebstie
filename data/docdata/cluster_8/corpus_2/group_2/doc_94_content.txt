Who exactly is &amp;amp;quot;bailing out&amp;amp;quot; these major financial institutions? Where is this money coming from to cover their financial downfall? Well, the government is &amp;amp;quot;borrowing&amp;amp;quot; this from the Federal Reserve and then we the tax payers are expeceted to pay it back WITH INTEREST! Now the private bankers behind the Fed control these multi trillion dollar companies and we&amp;#039;re paying for it. Doesn&amp;#039;t anyone else see the HUGE collapse we&amp;#039;re headed for?                      I&amp;#039;m actually very afraid you are right. I was thinking the very same thing about all these &amp;amp;quot;bail outs&amp;amp;quot; earlier this morning. None of this is done out of the goodness of anyone&amp;#039;s heart or for the greater good. It&amp;#039;s being done to consolidate power. I hope we&amp;#039;re just paranoid and things will work out but I&amp;#039;m not betting on that.
