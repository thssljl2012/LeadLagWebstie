The 25 million is for the design of two and the costs of one. The other bridge will be paid for by the CMLC. So it is even more expensive than what people who complain about these things are complaining about.     As for the Two bridge vs 3 bridge thing, if both bridges stop on the islands they are crossing it will work out to 4 bridges technically. (i think the st george bridge cross all the way to the north bank right?)
