Excerpt from Palin&amp;#039;s interview with Hannity tonight shows two separate repeated emphases on AIG&amp;#039;s construction bond business.  (She also referred to construction bonds this morning -- IOW, not a typo.)    This is bizarre.  I&amp;#039;m a construction defect atty and I deal with AIG because it used to/may still have a line of insurance for contractors, AISLIC.  I also deal with bonding companies who write construction bonds, but have never heard that AIG is one of them.  Bonds and insurance are not legally the same.  I just doublechecked AIG&amp;#039;s home page.  Construction bonds are not listed as a product offered by AIG.     IMO, she&amp;#039;s just choking and gagging on being fed too many talking points too fast, but why this particular emphasis? or is there a rational explanation that makes sense in another state?
