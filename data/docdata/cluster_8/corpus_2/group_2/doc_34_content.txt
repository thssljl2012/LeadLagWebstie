Thanks - just got rejected by Zopa. It&amp;#039;s so annoying when you go through the whole process and they ask for addtional info and then reject you due to the credit check.      They carry out a credit check with Equifax when you first make the application and it put me in the A rating. I then send a copy of my wage slip to prove income and they then reject me the next day! grrrr     Got my flybe card through today though :-)                                                        HSBC loan - 12500 HSBC CC - 2500    Egg CC - 2700 Capital 1 CC - 1000    Vanquis CC - 250 Citi Loan - 11000    Barclays Loan - 7000     Proud to be dealing with my debts
