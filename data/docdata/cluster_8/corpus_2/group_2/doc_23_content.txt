Fan and Fred needed to be bailed out, as the Government was, well... legally required to.     AIG? Not so much. I know it&amp;#039;s got a lot of insurance that would go up in the air if it went kaput... but hell...    I&amp;#039;m with Palin: It needed to happen, sorta. But it really pisses me off.         I kind of agree, but AIG has worldwide business. True, there are many other insurance companies, but AIG is pretty up there. If the government didn&amp;#039;t bail them out, a lot of people would have gotten into it deep.                  &amp;amp;nbsp;          &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;
