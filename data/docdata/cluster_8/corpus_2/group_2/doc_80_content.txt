 Offshore Sportsbooks &amp; Online Sports Picks looks like LEH going to be acquired by Barclays  (Rothchild&amp;#039;s flagship bank)    I wonder how much the US taxpayers will kick in the deal??    after the #2 Rothchild bank JPMorgan stole Bear Stearns, and the taxpayers chipped in, I&amp;#039;m beginning to beleive the whole thing was orchestrated    Keep in mind, it was under Bill Clintons watch that mortgages were allowed to be sliced and diced and  sold on the secondary market in the first place. BC&amp;#039;s godfather was Winthrop Rockefeller, and he was a Rhodes Scholar at Rothchild founded Oxford. The Rhodes scholarships are exclusively given to Illuminiatti. Just take a peak at the alumni.
