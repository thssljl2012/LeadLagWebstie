 Just took a call from a graduate who is currently working for Barclays in their commercial division asking me whether he should stick to that or do the postgrad course in investment banking.  I managed to handle the call without saying the word &amp;amp;quot;crunch&amp;amp;quot; once! Of course, my response was, and this is paraphrased somewhat, &amp;amp;quot;how the fuck should I know?! It&amp;#039;s your life you tard!&amp;amp;quot;
