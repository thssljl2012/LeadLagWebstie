    Those people are rude over there.&amp;amp;nbsp; I&amp;#039;m guessing they are angry and it turns out to be rude because most of the AIG employees are temps and they get no insurance, 401k plans, paid vacations, retirement gift, etc.&amp;amp;nbsp; Their rates should be lower due to all the money they are saving from hiring all temps and they pay no insurance, 401 contributions, vacations.&amp;amp;nbsp; Man it&amp;#039;s not fair.         &amp;amp;nbsp;          &amp;amp;nbsp;    Life is good, but Eternal Life will be better.
