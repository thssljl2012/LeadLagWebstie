  I am another customer who, being really busy just trying to make ends meet, hadn&amp;#039;t read the literature properly that Barclays sent through about the Reserve fee.  They are charging 22.00 every 5 days!  I have complained and asked for the facility to be removed from my account (it was applied without asking anyway).  O.K. I know I should have been more scrupulous in checking the charges but had two hectic weeks and didnt!  Now, I am 66.00 out of pocket and have learnt my lesson!  Barclays bordered on being quite rude on the phone.  I think that people should have to ask for the Reserve to be put on and sign something accepting the fees.
