In fact, a goberment representative called me today personally to &amp;quot;discuss&amp;quot; my threat of a Federal lawsuit and promised to resolve most of the screw up.               Yeah, I might end up losing some $$, but in the grand scheme of things, the amount will end up being chump change. Sorry haters, your attempt to celebrate my economic downfall was short lived. In fact, it back fired and you know I always get the last laugh.                                   Rob, there is no need to make any kind of insurance claim. The Feds are gonna pay me like AIG.             It&amp;#039;s the Tanfan bailout of 2008!!!!! You see, the Feds don&amp;#039;t want to see me go down. It could cause too much havoc in the overall economy.                          **** you Rob! Go collect the lint out of yo&amp;#039; momma&amp;#039;s belly button!
