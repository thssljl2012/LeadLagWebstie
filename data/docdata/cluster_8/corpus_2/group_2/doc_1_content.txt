 Well, in general I have no problem with &amp;amp;quot;big government&amp;amp;quot; (although that&amp;#039;s not the term I&amp;#039;d use). However, I want that government to:      A) Be well run, which our present one clearly is NOT, in any capacity, by either party. Huge, sweeping, foundation-level reforms are needed before the America takes on any new responsibilities.      B) Do things that benefit the majority of Americans, as opposed to only working for a wealthy minority. I guess technically this falls into that category, as it&amp;#039;s supposedly to avert worldwide financial collapse, but like I said, I can&amp;#039;t help but notice that the government only intervenes when rich people&amp;#039;s futures are at stake. The government can pay for AIG, but not for my health insurance, huh?      An no matter what your political stance, there&amp;#039;s no way you can look at our current level of national debt and find it acceptable. Liberal, conservative, doesn&amp;#039;t matter, it&amp;#039;s a matter of practicality, not ideology. Like I&amp;#039;ve been saying for years, almost every American can sit down and balance their checkbook at the end of the month, all I ask is that Congress do the same. Granted it&amp;#039;s a bit harder in their case, since they&amp;#039;re working with billions of dollars, but hey, we elect them because they&amp;#039;re smart, supposedly.
