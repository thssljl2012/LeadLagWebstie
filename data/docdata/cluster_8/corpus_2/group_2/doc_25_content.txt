Did you  apply  for the account a month ago? It sounds like your account was only opened about a week ago (based on Haircut&amp;#039;s assumptions - was too lazy to work it out  ).    When I applied for a new Cash ISA account this tax year, it took about a month for it to actually open because it was so popular (Barclays Tax Haven 6.25&amp;amp;#37;).
