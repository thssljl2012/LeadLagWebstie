   Hello folks,         This is a quote from the official Fast Payments website which is found on:      http://www.fastpayments.co.uk/faq.asp           Are All Banks In the Scheme?         Twelve banking groups (Barclays, HBOS, HSBC, RBSG, Lloyds TSB, Nationwide, Alliance &amp;amp;amp; Leicester, Co-op Bank, Abbey, National Australia Bank, Northern Rock, Danske Bank Group) have committed to implement the scheme. Between them they represent 95% of the payments made in the UK. The other banks and building societies will be making decisions on how, when and if to join the scheme over the next year or so.           Personally, I&amp;#039;ve never had a problem with transferring money through different accounts specially when transferring between Lloyds accounts but it does clearly say on the site that tranfers outside of &amp;amp;quot;so and so&amp;amp;quot; hours will not be made until &amp;amp;quot;so and so&amp;amp;quot; date if transfers are being made out of banking hours.
