Do I get a government check for my dumb azz investments that failed to pay off....no!         The faster we get to the bottom the faster the bleeding will stop and we can start healing.         rant off ...sorry                         Amen brother!  Let the market go where it may!  I will not vote for anyone who voted in favor of bailing out Freddie, Fannie, or any of the other bailouts.  Couldn&amp;#039;t agree more that the end isn&amp;#039;t here yet.  Wait untill the commercial real estate failures start hitting the market.  Must admit to being concerned about AIG as all my life insurance is with them and at my age, it won&amp;#039;t be easily replacable if at all.
