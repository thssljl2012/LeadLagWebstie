 This is just my opinion; I would consult a financial advisor before making any big decisions in this arena.     AIG is the worlds largest insurer. Insurance has always been their bread and butter even when they diversified out into other financial avenues. This was necessary as with insurance you collect all your money up front in the from of premiums. Then you go into areas like mortgage where you can lend out large sums of money for what was typically known as a guaranteed return (in the good ol days). AIG is so big there is not way the federal government will let them fail (at least I would hope not). I read recently that it could cost investors somewhere in the neighborhood of 170 to 180 Billion. The economy would have a tough time surviving a blow like that especially in its current state as the feds are well aware.      Vanguard is a good company. Typically your allocations are in stocks, bonds, and or cash. They have a MMA that is very conservative. Everyone has their own objectives but the typical responses on where to place your investments typically resides in how soon you might need access to funds. If youre young one might suggest a more risky approach like stocks. Right now you will take a beating but over the years the trends have been that you stand to benefit if you have time. If you need your funds sooner a more conservative approach like bonds or cash is typically recommended. Again this is just my two cents and I have been wrong before so take it for what its worth and contact a professional for the best advice. I would also contact the companies directly for literature to be mailed to me addressing my concerns such as how much of you money is covered or insured.
