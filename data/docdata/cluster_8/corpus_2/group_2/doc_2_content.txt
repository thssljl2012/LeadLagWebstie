                                                         They will probably just be selling insurance on behalf of someone else anyway (Barclays is using Gresham Insurance), so it may not really make any difference.     I&amp;#039;m suprised that either of these companies are competitive to be honest, although Barclays have only just recently entered the market so could be offering discounts.     Have you visited Quidco to see what cashback you can get from them or other insurance companies? That could make a sizeable difference!
