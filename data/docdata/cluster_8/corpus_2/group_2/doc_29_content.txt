Do you know?       I&amp;#039;ll pop into Abbey tomorrow.                      I&amp;#039;m sure Barclays is a new money ISA only, it does not accept transfers in. Since you have already started an ISA for this tax year then you would need to transfer and Barclays do not allow this.      I&amp;#039;m not an expert on ISAs but this is what I&amp;#039;ve picked up.
