           My sympathies go out to anyone who has been made redundant from the instability in the banking world. But there may still be hope for some of you: -       Barclays buys core Lehman assets       I have no doubt that there are rights and wrongs in the banking world, as there are with energy, transport, mining the list goes on. But I sympathise with   people   who have been made redundant, especially in the run up to Christmas.      I hope those that are quick to judge don&amp;#039;t find themselves in a similar position as a result of the fallout of the issues affecting the world of banking right now.      I think there is a culture of judgement, but it is not unique to the UK.
