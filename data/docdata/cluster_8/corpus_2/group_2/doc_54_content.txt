 I was getting ready to buy my points for our trip to WDW in December when I read yesterday that the insurance is backed by AIG. Does anyone think it is a bad idea to buy this insurance? We are going in December, traveling on developer points and 2007 points. We have a December UY.       Do you all buy travel insurance for your points? Will you do that after this past week since AIG is the backer?
