 Normanmark - it&amp;#039;s an exisiting customer BT, I have been with them for a while.     Methusla - thats interesting. I did speak to a (British) guy in the call centre yesterday and to be fair, he was helpful, and sympathetic. This was after a frustrating 6 minutes to India to be put on hold for 4 mins, then cut off!  He agreed with me that it was unfair without actually saying so (as i pointed out, he does work for BC and the calls are recorded - i worked for Barclays, so know what it&amp;#039;s like!)  Furthermore, he did actually say that they would look at refunding the interest levied - if it was, but could not waive it until it had been charged. This I understand, but it is still inherently unfair, and as a matter of principle, I will be closing the account. (I really don&amp;#039;t want to sound petty, but it is a means of short term borrowing. If my hands are tied behind my back, and I have a blindfold on - ie they don&amp;#039;t make this clause clear - I can&amp;#039;t avoid paying interest unless I can pay it all off, which means there was no point doing the BT).     Thanks all, I hope others avoid this silly situation     Vin
