           Quote:           I was just highlighting that there is a danger in flagging all use of biometrics as a problem.              I didn&amp;#039;t do that - yopu interpreted that. I was merely reporting what Barclays are doing and it appears to me that once they start demanding biometrics such as fingerprints etc. then the roads of ID cards and banks desire for biometrics as ID converge.                  Quote:           With respect to the use of the ID cards for banking transactions, this may well be the desire of the IPS but I think the banks would have a lot of concerns.             I am sure the banks and government could come to an arrangement regarding risk.
