  the aul limit is either on your account or not, theres not an actual limit its either the first 1000 pounds of your cheque you can use or you just wont be allowed to, i havent been informed that this limit has been taken off for any customers, but definetely never use the funds unless you phone and ask whether it is available once you have deposited the cheque, but yea loyalty is bullcrap, unless you have a business account then its slightly different for loyalty.
