Hey Feds,  How about buying out all those ARP mortgages that nailed Joe Q. Public to the wall and caused him to lose his home? How about those people? Since the money you are so squanderously spending is OURS, how about helping US instead of the corporate raiders and CEO crooks who only look for ways to avoid paying taxes and decent wages?? Folks, you are witnessing the dismantling of the United Staes of America. Let&amp;#039;s just guess where this 85 Billion came from, hmmmm, I bet your social security.
