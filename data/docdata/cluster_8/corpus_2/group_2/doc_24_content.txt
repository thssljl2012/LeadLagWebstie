If there&amp;#039;s 4 of you out on a night you&amp;#039;re better off with a cab (if not because you&amp;#039;ll get dropped at your door, but also because the increased fare for the service makes the taxi barely more expensive). Also if there&amp;#039;s a group of you you&amp;#039;re likely to be refused onto the bus anyway.   I agree that the trains should run later, but other than the intercity services it seems to be a national problem that they don&amp;#039;t run past midnight in most cases.                      I once posted some routes for a possible Leeds Nightrider network in the link and quote below:  http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showth...277950&amp;amp;amp;page=15  Surely late night public transport should be improved imo if Leeds was genuinely trying to be an all hours city.

Even our capital doesn&amp;#039;t have tube trains running past 12 and that&amp;#039;s supposedly a 24 hour city! meh!                      Good idea which also applies that I believe the UK and Ireland are the only countries in Europe not to have any rail services on Christmas Day except I believe for the Heathrow Airport Express running from Paddington station (when the GWR line which the Heathrow Express runs on is not closed for repairs). Out of interest could it be possible for First Transpennine Express to redirect their nightime services to also serve Bradford Interchange and Halifax stations on the Caldervale line between Leeds and Huddersfield (as opposed to the more direct Huddersfield Line) and also perhaps Stalybridge (whilst still on the main Transpennine route) to serve the east of the Greater Manchester conurbation at nights? Unless it would take too much time to go via Bradford and Halifax and if there was some sort of technical issue surrounding the running of trains along the Caldervale surely it would be a good idea in getting more passengers to use the Transpennine Express between Manchester and York at late nights although it would surely need to be marshalled bearing in mind the drunks on board coming home from a night out?        Also out of interest did any Sleeper services such as the Caledonian Sleeper which runs on the WCML or the Night Riviera on the GWR ever serve Leeds? I guess there would have been at one time a sleeper service which would have ran along the ECML past York which I presume had long since been axed (and does anyone know when this was axed if a Sleeper ever did run on the ECML)? Whilst unrealistic to ever expect such things (considering I believe the Night Riviera to the West Country was at risk of being axed only a few years ago and that they cost a lot to run and have very strong competition from conventional day time services and low cost airlines) could regular Intercity services along the ECML perhaps run through the dead of night at least every couple of hours running London - Edinburgh via the Leeds between Doncaster and York (something I guess could be another possible advantage of Leeds - York electrification)?      Also I noticed two of the automatic barriers have now been installed at Leeds station and are still under wraps and I guess it could be worth mentioning that the Eurochange Bureau de Change at Leeds station and adjacent Barclays cash machine has now closed.
