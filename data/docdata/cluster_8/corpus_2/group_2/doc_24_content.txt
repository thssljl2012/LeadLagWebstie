 Hi there  I live on my own and have for 4 years.  I had a letter a couple of weeks ago asking to confirm if I still lived on my own - which I do.  However, my boyfriend stays at mine most of the week but he pays council tax at his own house even though he&amp;#039;s not there that often.    I came home last night to a letter saying that the councils records show someone else is either living with me or has their post delivered there.  I keep getting letters for someone else but return them to Barclays.  Does anyone know where I stand?  I called the council and explained this and they said no problem - if my bf pays his ct and is registered somewhere else then its fine....and his post doesn&amp;#039;t come here.  Thanks
