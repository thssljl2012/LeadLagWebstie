          AIG and Katrina (not the most reliable source, but interesting)  ------------------------------------   Katrina; AIG Insurance/Greenburg&amp;amp;#039;s Office+Warren Buffett Refused To Send Help! By zorroz - Posted on August 10th, 2007   http://memes.org/katrina-aig-insurance-greenburgs-office-warren-buffett-refused-send-help   I&amp;amp;#039;ll probably add to this meme but here&amp;amp;#039;s the short version. Two days after New Orleans was hit by Katrina, it occurred to me that 72 hours was just about as long as the average person could survive without water. Elderly would begin to perish at 36 hours, infants would be at risk immediately unless they were breast feeding.   Why AIG? Because they insured the WTC and may have been responsible for certain underwriting requirements that are &amp;amp;quot;prophylactic&amp;amp;quot; in nature. Why Warren Buffett? Because he owns Executive Air and other private aircraft management entities. Executive Air owned a &amp;amp;quot;white plane&amp;amp;quot; that was circling over Shanksville, PA,, Latitude 40.07 as if it was waiting for something.   10 minutes later an aircraft reported to be Flight 93 &amp;amp;quot;exploded in a field&amp;amp;quot;. Buffett&amp;amp;#039;s firm also managed the small airport in Opa Locka Florida where &amp;amp;quot;Mohammad Atta&amp;amp;quot; practiced in the flight simulator known as &amp;amp;quot;SimCenter&amp;amp;quot;.   The SimCenter itself, is owned and operated by a subsidiary of the Carlyle Group. Opa Locka airport has several other claims to fame, including the jump off point for the CIA&amp;amp;#039;s Bay of Pigs Invasion. Opa Locka is also the &amp;amp;quot;Contractor&amp;amp;quot; for virtually all CIA flights to South America. It&amp;amp;#039;s where Manuel Noriega, President of Panama, was taken after we kidnapped him.   Keep in mind that Warren Buffett and several top executives from the WTC 1 &amp;amp;amp; 2 including ___________other companies were deep underground at a secret location in the Hills of Norad&amp;amp;#039;s HQ. The richest man in the world, Bill Gates, was with him.   Zorro just thought he give the &amp;amp;quot;cowards&amp;amp;quot; an opportunity to step up and do the right thing. zorro was wrong!   It appeared to zorro that Fema, nor the National Guard nor the US Army was helping, so I felt maybe the good lord expected me to try. So I did. I began to call the richest people in the US who owned &amp;amp;quot;aircraft&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;bottled water&amp;amp;quot; companies. The first two on my phone call list were Warren Buffett and Hank Greenburg. I spoke at length with their personal secretaries and they both refused to help while insisting they go to church regularly. They refused to lift a finger..but then I called the US Army Corp of Engineers, office of procurement in Lousiana...guess what they said.   There&amp;amp;#039;s more to this story and zorro will bring you the truth! By the way, ABC News and CNN covered it up. I can tell you I have conversations with the Mayor&amp;amp;#039;s office, with the Governor of Louisiana, the Governor&amp;amp;#039;s office for the State of Texas, the AIr National Guard, the Texas National Guard, the Louisiana National Guard and FEMA representatives. When zorro tells you that US ACE is BROKE...US ACE IS BROKE!   zorro   aka Water Wizard
