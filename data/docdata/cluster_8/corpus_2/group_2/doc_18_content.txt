    Hi,        We have a year and a half till our wedding (594 days according to her Bebo countdown!)        We have 4600 saved already in a A&amp;amp;amp;L savings PlusSaver at 4.5%        I&amp;#039;d love someone to check our logic...        We think the best course of action is to get rid of the A&amp;amp;amp;L account and to open the current best paying ISA&amp;#039;s - one each in both our names - then transfer 3,600 of savings into one of them and the remaining 1000 into the other.        With the 200 that my fiance saves each month she would put the money into topping up the ISA that has the 1000.        With the 200 that I save each month I would open up the Barclays Monthly Saving 7.75% and save for the next 12 month.        All our money must be available in 12-15 months time to finance the different aspects of the wedding.        What do you all think?        Does this all make financial/common sense?         We&amp;#039;d love to get this right but we&amp;#039;re just starting out on at this moneysaving game!        I look forward to all you experts keeping me on the straight and narrow!        Cheers      Scott &amp;amp;amp; Mairi
