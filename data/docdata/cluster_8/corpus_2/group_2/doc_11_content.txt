Thanks Svet. I just realized you guys would need to see the unfinished part to knwo the wording/style so here goers...Don&amp;#039;t laugh I did this all by myself adn my education isn&amp;#039;t that great. Also realize I need to update some things like refrences but I want to focus on the &amp;quot;Lindsey Insurance Agency&amp;quot; part right now:    August 2005-Present Lindsey Insurance Agency, Alstate Chesapeake, VA  Property/Casualty Insurance Agent      2002
