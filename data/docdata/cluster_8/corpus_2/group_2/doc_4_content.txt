  Hi Barclays did the same to me but I did get a letter.  I wrote back saying something along the lines of what I have put below.  Once they got that letter they wrote back very quickly and gave me the full refund.           Thank you for your refund of x pounds which I accept without prejudice as part settlement of my claim for x number of pounds.     However I must inform you that it is my intention to proceed with court proceedings should I not receive the remainder of my requested refund within 14 days.     I intend to instigate court proceedings on such and such a date.     However, in order to avoid this action I would be happy to accept a full refund of the charges I have paid.     Yours      blah, blah, blah
