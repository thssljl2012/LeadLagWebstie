           The maldives are in the S/Central Asia zone for US, so 120k per ticket or 240k total.  You have 85k US miles, plus move your SPG points over and you add 85k with bonuses. That gives you 170k.  Get both USAirways credit cards (25k+25K) and you are at 220k.  (if you do a 10k balance xfer on the Barclays Bank card with first 30 days and you get another 10kmiles).  What to do for that remaining 10 or 20k miles?  Well, if you have time you can apply for the BofA card pretty much over and over... hopefully you have time to do this.      You probably wont be able to route thru Dubai though.  The challenge will be finding 2 seats in C all the way.  Learn about the ANA tool (ANA&amp;#039;s award tool lets you search *A awards pretty easily) and learn all the *A segments you could use to get from here to there (and look them up individually).  Also, if the last segment to MLE isnt available in business class, consider flying into Colombo Sri Lanka and taking a short (and cheap) flight onward to Male.  The SIN-CMB flight always has award space up front.      You could also buy UA economy tix to Singapore and use miles to upgrade, (though I think you&amp;#039;d be buying Y/B fare in order to have enough miles) and then use 30k US miles per ticket to get to Male.      Good luck!
