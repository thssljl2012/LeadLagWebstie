 Sorry to be picky, but are we sure about this? I thought that the FSCS was for &amp;amp;quot;consumers&amp;amp;quot; meaning individuals who bank/invest in a personal, not a business, capacity       To be honest, the FSCS website is not clear - it interchanges the terms &amp;amp;quot;customers&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;consumers&amp;amp;quot;       Imagine if ........???? ..... Vodafone had a business account with Barclays and B went bust. Would Vodafone really get paid compensation ....????       I really don&amp;#039;t know the answer - but I&amp;#039;m certain that &amp;amp;quot;consumer protection&amp;amp;quot; is for the &amp;amp;quot;little man&amp;amp;quot; and not for a business. If you&amp;#039;re a sole trader with a personal account, then you are more than likely a &amp;amp;quot;consumer&amp;amp;quot;. If your account is in your name but T/A (trading as) XYZ then I&amp;#039;m not sure you will be a consumer. If you are ABC Ltd then you&amp;#039;re almost certainly NOT a consumer.     Hopefully, someone else will clarify my confusion and put the OP at ease!
