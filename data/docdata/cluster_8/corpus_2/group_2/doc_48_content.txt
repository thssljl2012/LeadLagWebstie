  Hi Lisa     Monument are a sub-prime lender and, therefore, it&amp;#039;s interest rates are higher as their customers typically are seen as high risk - I&amp;#039;m not trying to offend you by saying that, but that&amp;#039;s the way they do business.     Barclays sold Monument in June 2007 to the US based company, Compu Credit.  Barclays kept the customers it wanted and left the rest for Compu Credit to deal with, that&amp;#039;s why Monument still exists.     Barclays would have kept all the interest rates the same, so if I were you I would pay it off and start again somewhere else.     Hope this helps.
