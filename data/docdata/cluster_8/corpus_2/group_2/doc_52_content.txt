 FNM Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Hey you guys, I picked up some shares of LEH at $0.23...   Only a few thousand, but I think something is up...    The stock should be at $0.15 cents...    Barclays may think it is easier buy the equity at these prices than dealing with the legal hassle of going through creditors...    Just a long shot...
