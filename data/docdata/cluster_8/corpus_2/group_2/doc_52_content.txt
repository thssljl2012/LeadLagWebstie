                        I swear they&amp;#039;re messing with my head sometimes when they make subtle changes like that. Esp. commercials with two slightly different versions, like the two Old Spice commercials for the hair and body wash. The one with a bunch of guys saying &amp;quot;Is old spice hair and body wash right for me?&amp;quot; There&amp;#039;s a cop and a criminal in one scene. In one version of the commercial the announcer says &amp;quot;Sure, criminal&amp;quot; like he says to everyone else, but in another, he says &amp;quot;Ummmm, no&amp;quot; to the same guy. I mean, is there a reason for the two versions? Maybe watchers on one channel/time segment are more averse to using the same hair/body wash the criminals use? Really strange, and messes with my head.
