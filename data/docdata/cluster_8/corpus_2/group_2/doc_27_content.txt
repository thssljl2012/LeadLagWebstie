  I think Lloyds are a great bank, however one complaint I do have about them is their weekly text message service that texts you your bank balance on your chosen day.     It&amp;#039;s a great idea, but it tells you your Account Ballance and not your Available Balance. I don&amp;#039;t want to know my Account Balance, I was to know my Available Balance.     It wouldn&amp;#039;t be hard to add this next to your Account Balance in the text message.     Does any one else who uses this service feel the same way?.
