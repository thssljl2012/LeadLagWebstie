With that being said 25 billion is less than what it would cost all of us to pay the unemployment for the thousands upon thousands of employees they employee.  Not to mention the fact of what it would do to the economy and job market.      Do you have any idea how many companies rely on the big three for work?      And then there&amp;#039;s AIG.  Do you know you can&amp;#039;t build in this country legally without insurance.  What do you think would happen if AIG closed up shop.  How many construction compnaies and contractors that would have to stop working.  That would be great for the country.        Think before making dumb comments about things.  Pick and poke fun at the product all you want.  Heck I did in my post.  But to say they should go away is ludicrious.      Any other questions smart guy?                          I consult for an automotive manufacturer so yes I am well aware of the situation. Whatever happened to pure market capitalism? Chysler has made a go at it through private equity.
