Here&amp;#039;s one thing I don&amp;#039;t understand:  they let Lehmann go belly-up, and that turned out alright.  After they declared bankruptcy, the real value of some of their assets was determined, and Barclays swooped in and picked up a still-healthy part of their business.  Isn&amp;#039;t this how it&amp;#039;s supposed to work?  Why can&amp;#039;t they let this happen for other companies like AIG?  So far the only explanation I&amp;#039;ve heard is from Buffett, who said something along the lines of &amp;amp;quot;everyone trying to deleverage at the same time&amp;amp;quot;=bad.  Still don&amp;#039;t quite see how that&amp;#039;s catastrophic.
