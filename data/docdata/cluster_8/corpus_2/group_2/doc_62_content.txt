      :::HEADDESK:::        Wow. Apparently these days all we need is some retarded and incorrect math, bad syntax, and rah-rah claptrap to get people to think your idea is brilliant. This crap drives me so insane these days. I get forwarded dumb sh*t like this at work, and it gets promptly deleted.         Even 700,000,000,000 / 200,000,000 = $3,500 per person. Which, after taxes, assuming a 25% tax rate, is $2,625. I&amp;#039;d certainly like it, I&amp;#039;d certainly use it, but that&amp;#039;s not a life changer. That&amp;#039;s 1/12 of my total debt load counting car, credit cards, and student loans. I&amp;#039;d buy an iPod or get some car repair work done, then I&amp;#039;d toss the rest to Citibank.         I&amp;#039;ve got mixed feelings about the bailout, but I also think that if there was any kind of reasonable private solution, it would have been offered by now. I&amp;#039;m sure banks and insurance companies have looked at AIG to see if there&amp;#039;s anything that could be salvaged there, and I&amp;#039;m sure they saw a lead weight that would do nothing but drag them down.         AIG Insurance had an assets to equity ratio of 11 to 1. Geico is 2 to 1. Travelers is 4 to 1. Actually, almost all carriers are in the 2-1 or 4-1 ratio. You do not want a Hurricane Ike to hit at the same time your cash flow is crashing and your investments are tanking. And you certainly do not want to purchase a company that is in that situation, because it is risky to your own policyholders. So, this may be the only feasible option. I just hope it&amp;#039;s handled well. _________________ If you could only see the way I see     Then you&amp;#039;d know I wanted to be an astronaut    And not a messed up boy     Who gets tounge-tied when you see me         And your leg brushes against my skin    And you don&amp;#039;t even notice my grin
