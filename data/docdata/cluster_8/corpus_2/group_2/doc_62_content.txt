 AIG&amp;#039;s insurance division is a proven moneymaker over the years   You and I have roughly equal concerns ~ other than your tired &amp;#039;socialism boogeyman&amp;#039; screed.    But the above quote from your post is ancient history.  All these real-estate derivitives in recent years have been insured by AIG because they were so &amp;#039;safe&amp;#039; and were easy commissions when things were going good.  It is estimated that there is as much as a quadrillion dollars (that&amp;#039;s 1,000 TRILLION) in derivitive based securities on the market.  If only 10 percent go bad... well, you do the math.  That&amp;#039;s more than the GDP of the entire world for years.  And who&amp;#039;s on the hook?  Look in a mirror.  Yah... deregulation got us in to this mess.  &amp;quot;Rugged individualism&amp;quot; won&amp;#039;t be nearly enough to get us out.  You were sold out for the figurative forty pieces of silver.
