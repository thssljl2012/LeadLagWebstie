           AIG better watch out if Premier League jinx continues    Commentary: Stock performance of U.K. soccer sponsors not very good   By MarketWatch  Last update: 8:14 a.m. EDT Sept. 12, 2008  LONDON (MarketWatch) -- It&amp;amp;#039;s long been observed that the companies that sponsor American sports stadiums tend to soon fall on hard times. It looks like the sponsors of British soccer clubs, which get their names plastered on uniforms, may now be suffering that same fate.  On Friday, XL Leisure, the tour operator that sponsors West Ham United, went bankrupt.  See related story.   That follows last year&amp;amp;#039;s nationalization of Northern Rock, which still, incredibly, sponsors Newcastle United.  American International Group (AIG) in April 2006 signed the biggest shirt-sponsorship deal ever, paying $100 million to get its name on the jerseys of star striker Wayne Rooney and his teammates.  That wasn&amp;amp;#039;t the top for AIG&amp;amp;#039;s stock, but it was pretty close: Shares of the Dow Jones Industrial Average component have tumbled since.       AIG already has gotten rid of a British chief executive; maybe it&amp;amp;#039;s time to ditch a U.K. sponsorship, too.  How about Garmin (GRMN) ? The map-device maker sponsored Middlesbrough in July 2006 -- and don&amp;amp;#039;t worry if you&amp;amp;#039;ve never heard of the club, or the town; it&amp;amp;#039;s far from a prime U.K. tourist destination -- and has dropped about 60% since.  Samsung Electronics (SSNG.Y) enjoyed a nice rally from the time it reached an agreement to sponsor Chelsea in April 2005 till its peak in 2006. But from there, the stock is down 40%.  Perhaps the delayed reaction is in sympathy with Chelsea&amp;amp;#039;s plodding style that so annoys the team&amp;amp;#039;s Russian billionaire owner, Roman Abramovich, who has cycled through three managers in two years&amp;amp;#039; time.  It&amp;amp;#039;s hard to find any stock-market darling among Premier League corporate sponsors, in fact: There are JJB Sports (UK:JJB: news, chart, profile) , down 35% over the last year; Carlsberg, down 22% over 52 weeks; and LG Electronics, which has climbed over the last year but is off 26% in the last three months.  About the only good news for Richard Fuld is that Lehman Brothers isn&amp;amp;#039;t on the list, proving that a firm can get it wrong without the pitfalls of U.K. soccer sponsorship.  But one of Lehman&amp;amp;#039;s rumored suitors is ... Barclays (BCS) , and Barclays sponsors the entire league.   -- Steve Goldstein, London bureau chief      Source
