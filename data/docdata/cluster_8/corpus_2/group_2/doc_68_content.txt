         Anybody else think this is partially AIG related?  The biggest writer of insurance is out and all others need to be conservative. Good for all especially conservative guys like ours.  On top of that all financial assets look better and MKL is an owner of financial stocks.  Pretty much the sweet spot for MKL today and going forward.
