 Hi..     I am due to go bankrupt on 30th October and was wondering if I could sell my car worth 9000 and use this to offer final settlements to my four creditors:     Barclays: 16000     Barclaycard: 4500     GE Money: 13000     MBNA : 3000     What is the chance of creditors accepting if I did this bearing in mind they would get nothing after bankruptcy as I&amp;#039;m currently unable to work due to health problems?  Would the OR look down on this if I went bankrupt at a later date and he found out I&amp;#039;d disposed of an asset?     Thankyou
