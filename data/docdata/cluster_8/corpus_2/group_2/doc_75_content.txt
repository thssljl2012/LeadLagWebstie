 So are you saying that you are overdrawn because you withdrew the money that you should have left there to cover the petrol? If so, you haven&amp;#039;t got a leg to stand on.     I have never heard the rule that a transaction has to be debited within 7 days of your PIN being entered, I suspect that this is complete and utter rubbish. Whilst most do get debited pretty quickly, there are some that take longer and you need to check your account to make sure, not assume that it must have gone out and spend the money!     I think that you stand no chance whatsoever of getting your money back
