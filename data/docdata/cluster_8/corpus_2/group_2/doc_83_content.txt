I&amp;#039;ve used Lewis&amp;amp;amp;Lewis for years, but maybe I need to shop around again. - sheureka                      Our policies are through Garcia Insurance Services,  www.garciainsurancemx.com     AIG covers our US registered 1999 Nissan Pathfinder @ $266 per year.  ANA covers our 2007 Smart Passion @ $450 per year. This higher price is because it is registered in Jalisco, not the USA. Both are &amp;#039;full coverage&amp;#039;.
