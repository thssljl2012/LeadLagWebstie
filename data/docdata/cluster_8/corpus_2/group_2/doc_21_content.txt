So I asked, &amp;amp;quot;New Yankee Stadium?&amp;amp;quot;      Blank stare... But anyway, our company deals with alot of AIG insurance and crap, and apparently, though this is unsupported by any facts, nationwide stores are cutting hours of all hourly employees.       Awesome, not only do I have to pay for the bailout, but my work hours get cut for it. Thanks alot capatilism.       The only perk of the night was meeting a guy wearing one of those cool Chevy Camaro jackets with all the badges of performance models on it. He said it went with his 01 LS1.       Thank god i have a semi-union job to get ready for,.                      and what exactly would happen if nothing was done and AIG folded...yep, you&amp;#039;d be trying to collect unemployment.  don&amp;#039;t bite the hand that feeds you.
