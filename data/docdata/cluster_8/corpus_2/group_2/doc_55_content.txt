 hey, it only took what, 3 weeks?         Sarah Palin took her first impromptu question from a reporter traveling with her campaign Wednesday while shaking hands at a restaurant called Karl&amp;#039;s Inn of the Barristers in Cleveland.      A pool reporter from the national press corps asked Palin&amp;#039;s reaction to the federal bailout of insurance giant AIG.      Palin said she is &amp;amp;quot;disappointed that taxpayers are called upon to bailout another one.&amp;amp;quot;      &amp;amp;quot;Certainly AIG, though, with the construction bonds that they&amp;#039;re holding, and with the insurance that they are holding, very, very impactful to Americans,&amp;amp;quot; she said. &amp;amp;quot;So you know, the shot that has been called by the feds, its understandable but very, very disappointing that taxpayers are called upon for another one.&amp;amp;quot;      The reporter asked Palin if she had plans to come to the back of the campaign plane to chat with the reporters who cover her as she campaigns around the country.      &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re getting lonely back there,&amp;amp;quot; the reporter said.      &amp;amp;quot;Are you getting lonely?,&amp;amp;quot; Palin answered. &amp;amp;quot;Gee, yeah, come on up then!&amp;amp;quot;      When Palin entered the restaurant with her husband Todd, she introduced herself to about 10 patrons as &amp;amp;quot;Sarah,&amp;amp;quot; and told them, &amp;amp;quot;Excuse me for interrupting your meal.&amp;amp;quot; It was Palin&amp;#039;s first retail campaign stop since the day McCain tapped her as his running mate.
