 Hi there     I have just checked my Barclays account and can see that they have refunded me for the tickets I purchased on my debit card.     Although I am so relieved that I have got the money back and obviously grateful to Barclays - BUT I cannot help but be really peeved that the bank have refunded it themselves and that the scam mongers have got MY money.     I would liek to thank the originators of this forum for showing me how to proceed. Without your tips and advice I wouldn&amp;#039;t of known which way to go.     Cheers everyone x
