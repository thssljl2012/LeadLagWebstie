Answer to Why do this travel?  Desire to see whats out there; see something different; romance of the journey; for the adventure; perception that CA and SA are easier than Africa or more exotic destinations;   Most important lesson learned: How happy people can be with so little.        [Editor&amp;#039;s comments: It was great to meet Rick and Kathy in person, and fun to finally interview some Americans. U.S. overlanders are very rare out here.       It is my opinion that the Howe&amp;#039;s experience living full time in an RV for five years greatly aided them in making the transition from a 34&amp;#039; diesel pusher to the smaller Tiger and in knowing what they would / could need. Although they admitted to the same trepidation about what they would need in CA/SA in that regard as we experienced.       We almost bought a Tiger, so it was very interesting to be inside one again. I think they make a great package in terms of overall size and capability, although the lack of storage is a very real challenge for full time expedition / overlanding life. The advantages of a Class C are evident in terms of the packaging options it gives the designer.       The big question about the Provan Tiger for this type of application has always been their rigidly mounted camper box. The Howe&amp;#039;s came down some very rough chicken bus roads on their way to our location, so it was capable of surviving CA and those roads, at a minimum. I did not ask about or do any inspection for cracks or other signs of failure in the camper box. Rick and Kathy are very happy with the Tiger, and based on my impressions of them, I don&amp;#039;t think they would hesitate to share any shortcomings or failures with it. Patagonia, Ruta 40 and the Carretera Austral will be a true test for it.]      Here are Rick Howe&amp;#039;s comments regarding the roads, etc. 25 September, 2008: &amp;amp;quot;We estimate that approximately 20% of our 46,000 plus miles on the Tiger have been on substandard roads; from the Dalton and Dempster highways in Alaska and the Yukon to all of the secondary roads and tracks we&amp;#039;ve traveled throughout Central and South America to date. Despite all of that abuse, we have had absolutely no failures of any kind either internally or externally related to the original construction of the Tiger.  It remains as sound and solid as the day we purchased it.      We consider the Tiger to be, for us, the perfect vehicle for the trip we have embarked on and the ones still ahead of us.&amp;amp;quot;                       Overall length comparison with our Fuso. The leading edge of the front bumpers were aligned. The delta in overall length is just about exactly the length of our garage. Rick has always traveled on or with a motorcycle, so he was pining for his bike when he saw ours out.                  Storage box Rick added to the base Tiger.                        Front receivers which allow the storage box to be mounted front or rear.
