    Christian Gal:       Breakfast Burrito:   With the AIG bail-out I just wanna know what are we doing about it? Now I know some people are going to come in here a say that God doesn&amp;#039;t exsist and if He did why is it happening? I don&amp;#039;t care about you, well I do but only to a certain extent. I&amp;#039;m asking the people that know that He exsist and can feel him. I just wanna know.   What&amp;#039;s AIG?      my auto insurance carrier, guess I better start looking for another......
