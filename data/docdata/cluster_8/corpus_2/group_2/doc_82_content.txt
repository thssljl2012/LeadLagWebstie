I have never (yet) incurred a charge on my Switch/Maestro debit card.                      true, both the A&amp;amp;amp;L and Barclays are VISA debit cards - but it certainly never used to be the case that they charged 2% for these transactions. If I had known I would have drawn the money directly from the ATM located there. I&amp;#039;ll use my Nationwide debit card overseas for any further transactions - but just was totally not expecting the 2% fee on my debit card for effectively a sterling transaction in the UK.
