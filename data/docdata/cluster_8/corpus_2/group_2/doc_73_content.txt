 Edited on Sat Sep-20-08 04:28 PM by kirby         Personally, I think the American public shares a good bit of blame on this mess too. You are right, many people are living beyond their means. Many people used their homes as an ATM machine and kept refinancing over and over and over, each time increasing their debt. But if you look at the underlying reasons why people were using their home as an ATM machine there are many problems: lowering wages, health care, consumer economy, etc.  But I dont think that is the real crisis that triggered this. The real crisis is the fancy financial schemes devised that were based on flawed data. It was a crime to allow so much leveraging by banks. Then you had AIG writing insurance on stuff assuming low levels of defaults, etc.
