 So I get a letter in the mail today dated Sept. 3, 2008 here&amp;#039;s what it says:      We are writing regarding the above-captioned claim. There will be a delay with regard to the disposition of you comprehensive claim due to the following reason(s):      We are currently investigating the facts and circumstances surrounding this loss.      We requested an appraisal be completed on your motorcycle to verify its value.      This is a bunch of crap.
