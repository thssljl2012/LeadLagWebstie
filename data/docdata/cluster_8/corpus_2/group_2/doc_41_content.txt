 Au contraire Agent Z... It  is  asinine to operate a business on those percentages.  You are setting yourself up for failure.    Buying your office furniture through and from SF is another mistake.  A little judicious shopping will get you the same thing for about half the price.    If you come in the door bending to their every whim, you will be destined to a future of the same.  Stand up to them from the beginning and use common sense.      You ask what contract I hold.... AA3/4.  Any agent that willingly took the AA97 or the Blend will tell you now that is was a huge mistake.  Trusting the company is a mistake... it is not the same company it was years ago under the reins of Ed Rust Senior and Don Rood.      You say it was different back then and imply how easy it was. Was it different,...of course.  Was it easy.... not at all.  I started  Scratch  in a small town working 12 to 14 hours a day for the first year.  In the 13th month renewals kicked in.  I finished first in both my course schools and made the TOP 50 in the Reflector.  (its top 100 now)  Bottom line is, how bad do you want it and are you willing to pay the price.    I signed a contract under a defined set of circumstances.  I have lived up to my end of the bargain and honored the contract.  I fully intend to enjoy the rewards of those 30 yrs of work.    You have signed a different contract with a different set of conditions.  You came in with eyes open (I assume) and now must live up to your contract.    I personally would not have accepted the contract you signed.  I am an INSURANCE AGENT.... not a securities broker or banker.  I do not and will not do securities.  I do hold the CLU designation which means that I have more knowledge of securities than any agent who just took a course to pass the test.      Jack of all Trades and Master of None ?  I choose to be Master of Insurance.  That&amp;#039;s what I do...and I do it damn well.
