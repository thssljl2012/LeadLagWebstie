 Americans only (and it affects us) that have their insurance through them.  It affects teh ENTIRE economic sphere.  There are Europeans who have insurance claims with AIG and we have Asian countries connected to AIG.  AIG collapses and it&amp;#039;s over, there&amp;#039;s no doubt about.  Everyone gets fucked over...  I don&amp;#039;t like the Bail out, but I agree it has to be done and I agree that they should create the provisions Obama set out and more.
