I would ring your bank to see about an emergency replacement.                      i understand the logic. doesn&amp;#039;t stop me not having a visa card tho.      i phoned my bank and First Direct were no real help (wife has a visa which she could have had reissued and sent - if we agreed to the risk - but would have taken 7-10 days). Barclays (which i have a visa debit with) I couldn&amp;#039;t get through to anyone without my card number!? god i hate those fuckers.
