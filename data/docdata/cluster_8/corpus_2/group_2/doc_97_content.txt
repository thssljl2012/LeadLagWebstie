So basically the Feds cheated a well organized, well run company out of a larger share of the markets they are currently thriving in.  Mutual was the first to bail out of other markets that were either non-profitable or shaky.      AIG is just another sick puppy that needed to be bashed over the head with a shovel so the other puppies would get more milk.  Fucking government.  Hypocrisy piled on top of hypocrisy.  This is just the beginning.  I fear we will be wiping our asses with dollar bills because its cheaper then Charmin.                      Yep as part of this bailout, AIG should be forced out of offering life, health, auto, homeowners, etc insurance, and let other insurance companies bid on those outstanding AIG policies.  This would have also lessened the tax payers expense in bailing out AIG.
