 Hello,        I was wondering if anyone had advice on a suitable bank account we could open for our shareclub.        I&amp;#039;ve spoken to Nationwide but they do not offer any telephone or internet facilities - We need to go to the branch to check a balance!        Barclays will only open a business account - this doesn&amp;#039;t seem right for an Investment club!        I only asked the Co-op about their community direct account (as suggested in the manual) but they didn&amp;#039;t know what I was talking about.        I&amp;#039;m not sure if I&amp;#039;ve just be speaking to the wrong people.  No-one at the Co-op or Barlcays had ever opened an account for an investment club previously.            Any help would be appreciated.        Thanks,    Gary
