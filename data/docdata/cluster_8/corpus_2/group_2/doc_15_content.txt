This Depression, we have insurace companies failing...all because of risky investments (mortgages in a failing housing market...little did they know these would bcome risky!)...if insurance companies like AIG (aka American General) had stuck to fixed insurance (rather than getting involved in variable, risky investments) this would not have happened...just banks would be going belly up again....SO THIS TIME&amp;amp;lt; we are REALLY in trouble...if insurance companies go, then the entire ecomony will fail...AIG is the largest insurance company in the WORLD, and one of the biggest multinational corporations...we are in MUCH MUCH deeper than the media is reporting...and, no, I am not a doomsdayer or a doomsayer...just siting facts...  Glad I am no longer working at Wachovia...or AIG...or involved in investments anymore...either myself or selling any...
