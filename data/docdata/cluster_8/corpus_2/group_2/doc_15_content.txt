The Government needs to accept some of the blame for the stupid madates they insisted on along with cutting the reserves that were to be insurance for high risk loans.

If Merrill-Lynch were to fold you would keep your funds in tact except for any stock you held in Merrill-Lynch itself.             hotrod is correct.  The SIPC insures brokerage accounts up to $500k and up to $100k in cash.     Thanks.  When the bond matured, we paid the fall tuition then left the remainder of the money in some sort of liquid cash account.  We are about to move it elsewhere until the spring tuition bill is due.
