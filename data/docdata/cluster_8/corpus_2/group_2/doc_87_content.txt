 In 1973 I moved to Jersey where I worked for Shorrok (sic) Security Systems for three years. I had my wages paid into Barclays bank in St Helier. When I came home to Lancashire I left my last wage in the bank in case I decided to return, but I never did. I have since lost my paying-in book, sort code, etc.  I was wondering if there is a way of finding out about it.       S Rothwell.
