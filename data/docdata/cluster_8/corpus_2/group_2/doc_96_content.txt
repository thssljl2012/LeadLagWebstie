Ok, so the surge is working. Violence is down. That&amp;#039;s certainly a good thing. But now what? Do we maintain this increased troop presence indefinitely? We can&amp;#039;t afford it, this country&amp;#039;s economy is teetering on the edge of the cliff as it is, huge banking and investment firms are failing left and right. The government had to bail out AIG Insurance to the tune of $85  Billion  dollars. Where is all this money going to come from?     As long as there are U.S. troops in the middle east there will be people trying to kill them. We need to bring them home and let the Iraqis take over. It&amp;#039;s for everyone&amp;#039;s good.                      Do you realize and understand that there are US troops all over the world, and in a lot of those places, there are people who hate the US?  Also, do you realize that there were more American CIVILIANS murdered in Detroit last year than military in IRAQ?     I support our troops 100% and to say that what they are doing isn&amp;#039;t effective or necesary is a slap in their face.  It&amp;#039;s tough enough to be half way across the globe in a foreign country, but to hear that your country doesn&amp;#039;t support what you are doing is a sin.  Obama&amp;#039;s camp knows this and that&amp;#039;s why they haven&amp;#039;t pushed that issue in the campaign.
