  If you want to start work swindling people out of money for nothing, have you ever considered just getting a job at Barclays? You might even have a chance to sleep at night that way.    Any information I, or anyone sane on these boards, can give you will most likely be angry and filled with swear words. Seriously, you want us to give you a step by step guide on lying to people and taking their money, especially at a time when people are concerned about their debts and therefore vulnerable to shysters selling quick fixes?
