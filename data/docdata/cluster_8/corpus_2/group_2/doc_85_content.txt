                  Take a Piece of ICE and slam it into the old windshield molding then take the same piece and slam it into your fiberlgass the fiberglass will not dent the metal will dent.      My ZR-1 was out in a freak hail storm at the Corvette Museum a few years ago and the windshield molding took one single dent, the rest of the car was just fine. worst part of that is there was a NCRS meet that weekend and alot of Old Vettes were stuck outside in the weather!            Now I cant help with the paint issue Im very sure that the paint can be damaged y hail but inssurance companies will always try to stick it to you they are in the business of making money not shelling it out.
