 Hi  In Feb I did a BT of part of the money owed on my HSBC visa, to Goldfish, and have a long (36mth) low deal which I am paying off slowly.  That still leaves 6.7K on my HSBC visa card. I intended to leave it a bit, then try to transfer some more. Seven months probably counts as a reasonable gap.    The best card now looks to be Barclaycard OnePulse.  My OH banks with Barclays, and has a Barclaycard and a Barclayloan (car). Does anyone know will this make any difference, either to the amount they will offer me, or to the way they treat him in the future?     Many thanks  Cbm
