I gave AIG a call last year for my car insurance. Their commercial made it seem like they were the least expensive, but I got a quote, and they weren&amp;#039;t. At all.    They had several T.V. commercials a day for several months, maybe even a year. Maybe that&amp;#039;s where all their money went.  First you have to be able to back up your claim on the commercial, or else you are just wasting money advertising it.
