  I just got a call from Cover Girl studios, the woman wanted me to pay 30 upfront which she said I&amp;#039;d get back. When I said I wasn&amp;#039;t sure about it she said that *after* I&amp;#039;d paid, I would get a confirmation number or something and I could ring Barclays with this number so they could confirm the transaction was legitimate. I said there wasn&amp;#039;t much point finding out after I&amp;#039;d paid but she insisted there was no other way. I said I wanted to find out more and she directed me to their own website and told me not to Google it. When I said I&amp;#039;d found bad comments on here she told me their competetitors post bad reviews on websites... Definitely sounds like a scam to me! As I think somebody pointed out, it&amp;#039;s not worth the risk even if it is legit, might as well spend the money on a nice haircut that you know you can take home with you!
