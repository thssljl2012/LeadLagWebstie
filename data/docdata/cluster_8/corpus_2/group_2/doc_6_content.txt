  You may like to print out this webpage to quote to Barclays.        http://barclays.metafaq.com/template...3D3BVJIA4DL  U      It supports the idea that (depending on which account you have) you&amp;#039;re entitled to draw up to 1000 against uncleared funds. It does say it&amp;#039;s subject to status and limits, but I think it&amp;#039;s reasonable to expect that they wouldn&amp;#039;t change the way they treat your account without informing you.     I used to work in Barclays returning unpaid cheques. I didn&amp;#039;t get to make the decisions, I just did the admin (which, incidentally, was quite involved and time consuming). I did have to bounce many cheques for being drawn against uncleared funds (UC) but we were told not to charge the customer in these cases. Other cheques that bounced for lack of funds were printed with (RD) or (RDPR) ( Return to Drawer  and  Return to Drawer Please Represent ) and were charged.     Unfortunately I can&amp;#039;t confirm whether this has changed - I left the job for a far more rewarding one in the public sector that didn&amp;#039;t involve levying punitive charges on struggling customers.
