I don&amp;#039;t think that it&amp;#039;s such a bad idea that the criteria should be tougher for getting loans.  Maybe we wouldn&amp;#039;t be getting the current shaft.                      Not heaps, but yes there is insurance for many of those loans.  AIG was in that business and they did not end up doing so well
