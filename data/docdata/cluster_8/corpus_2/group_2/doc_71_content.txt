 I have my Post Office transfer form here in front of me but I am bit concerned about the terms on the back which you have to agree to.    To start with it says:         Quote:                         &amp;#039;I apply to transfer my existing ISA investments as detailed in Section 3 and subscribe to this cash ISA for the tax year beginning 6 April 20xx and each subsequent year until further notice&amp;#039;.                     It also says:         Quote:                         &amp;#039;I have not subscribed and will not subscribe, to another cash ISA in the same tax year that I subscribe to this cash ISA&amp;#039;.                     I already have a cash ISA for this tax year with Barclays, so are the terms above worded wrong for a transfer?    Very reluctant to put my name to this + how can I put a year in when I am not subscribing?    Cheers,    Gazza.
