 There is. You have put you student loan into Barclays. This is what is stopping you. It was a generic answer.    You need to put some sort of regular income. Yes. Wages are fine.    If you just use the Natwest account to abuse the overdraft they are likely just to close you account.    And to your question above to someone else. Interest Rates are likely to fall because of the credit crunch and inflation being sky rocketed. Currently it is staying the same for the past few months.         Quote:                         I&amp;#039;ve heard that transferring money from your cashISA to your student loan could lose you interest, I&amp;#039;m not sure if that&amp;#039;s true?                     What do you mean? (don&amp;#039;t really understand the question)
