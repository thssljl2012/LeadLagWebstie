 OK first off. If your OH has a &amp;amp;quot;normal&amp;amp;quot; bank acount he will have to open a basic one,as a normal account will more than likely get frozen.If he uses yours(and it is not joint) then thats fine. As one of the restriction of bc is that you do not have an overdraft ect. Either barclays or co-op are bc friendly,with co-op having a nice electron card with theirs. Co -op are now gettin tougher so if they are one of your OH creditors they may decline him.        On his SOA your OH has to put total amounts for all household bills. Then things like health,car expenses(if he has a car in his name) he puts what hepays out.     If you are earning you OH has to include your  contribution  (this is usually 50% if you both earn more or less the same amount per mth)to the household bills. You also put any benefits you are getting. Some (although you still have to include them)like CB are not counted by the OR towards your mthly income.     Hope that helps.Keep asking the more knowledgable you are the better.Dx
