Dear Barclays (Barnes and Noble MC) gave me a whopping $500 CL, lol. When I asked why, they said that I appeared to already have enough credit.        Well the interesting thing is I app&amp;#039;d to Cabelas first and then Partners First. Wayyy surprised at PF on the other hand, but when Cabelas pulled my Efx I would have had ZERO Inquiries at the time. I&amp;#039;m going to see what I can do about CL. I might even ask PF for a CL when I call just for the heck of it.        &amp;amp;nbsp;               MyFico Scores (TU/Exp/Efx):  6/29/08 700/697/718 - 5/4/08:667/703/668 - 11/07 Low 500s All (Fako)
