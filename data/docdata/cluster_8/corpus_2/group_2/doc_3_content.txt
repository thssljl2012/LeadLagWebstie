What this proves is McCain is a huge hypocrite. He claims to put country first, but clearly he did not do that when he chose Palin as his running mate. He chose getting elected president over the needs of the country.   Because of his age and his prior bouts with cancer, he has a one in three chances of dying during his first term. Does anyone think Palin is qualified to be President? How can anyone with a straight face say that. She clearly has no understanding of  even basic foreign affairs nor does she have any understanding of complex economic issues. Given the stock market melt down today and the liklihood that more banks are going to fail as well as the insurance giant AIG, we live in very dangerous times. This was brought about largely because of the rigid idological belief that regulation was unnecessary so these banks were allowed to pile on risk without disclosing it or even themselves fully undersatnding the risk they were taking on.   Does anyone think she has an understanding of these issues, or that she would take the proper steps to insure this does not repeat itself.   McCain&amp;#039;s choice of Palin is exactly parallel to the Emperor Caligula who made his horse a tribune of Rome except that the horse could not become Emperor so maybe Caligula was in fact even more responsible than McC ain  McCain has shown that he is a dishonorable man, nothing more than a political hack. All of this nonsense about change, and honor. He is  a man completely without honor, and nothing more than a gross hypocrite. I hope in November he gets what he gets the kick in the a-s that he deserves.  Shame on him
