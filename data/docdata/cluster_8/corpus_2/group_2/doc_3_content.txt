Trouble was, each subsequent wave went a bit lower than the previous one.     I think we could see something similar but timing is the question.    Also, we have never been in a period like the present one so it&amp;#039;s hard to say what might happen if the world central banks decided to monetize large amounts of toxic debt, especially within a background of deflating asset prices. This is not the 30&amp;#039;s - it&amp;#039;s potentially worse but the tools to deal with the problems are also potentially more effective. They just haven&amp;#039;t yet been used in real time.    Sometimes I think however that its not unlike war - decades ago, a major world war was self limiting - a similar world war today would also be self limiting but for different reasons and with far more horrible consequences.       thread start
