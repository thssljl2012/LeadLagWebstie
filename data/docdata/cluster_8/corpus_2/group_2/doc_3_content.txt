 This is Obama&amp;#039;s plan, as far as I understand it:  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Help &amp;quot;distressed homeowners&amp;quot;.&amp;amp;nbsp; In other words, help pay their mortgages with our tax dollars.&amp;amp;nbsp; I heard Joe Biden emphasize this the other morning.&amp;amp;nbsp; This would be the absolute biggest bank bailout ever.&amp;amp;nbsp; All of a sudden their sh*tty loans would turn golden, and on our dime.&amp;amp;nbsp; Even better, idiot jackoffs that bought houses they couldn&amp;#039;t afford get to stay, and they will owe less.&amp;amp;nbsp; Alpine&amp;#039;s neighbors will get hundreds of thousands of federal dollars, but he won&amp;#039;t get any since he can afford his house.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Alpine, I know a couple people that are going to Barclays.&amp;amp;nbsp; It&amp;#039;s not &amp;quot;most&amp;quot; of the company, but most of the NYC offices.&amp;amp;nbsp; Their 401k&amp;#039;s and stocks are decimated, but this is a pretty good outcome given the circumstances.
