I don&amp;#039;t understand all of it, but this article is pretty good:   5 Questions:  Why AIG matters to you .  From that, it doesn&amp;#039;t sound like there&amp;#039;s a good reason to bail them out.  If the AIG holding company does fail, the insurance company can still operate for awhile.  If it fails, the states can take over claims payments, and insureds will still get their payments if they have a loss.  I think it&amp;#039;s better to let that happen.  I don&amp;#039;t like the idea of every failing giant company getting government handouts just because they&amp;#039;re big.  Alison, I wouldn&amp;#039;t worry about switching your money just yet, if you only have regular checking/savings, and if your bank is FDIC insured (and pretty much every bank is).  You can check out the  FDIC website  to make sure that all your money is protected.  Still, it never hurts to keep some cash on hand.  I&amp;#039;ve used Bank of America for the past four years, and they&amp;#039;re not too bad.  Kind of like the Wal-Mart of banks.  Not personal or super-friendly, but I like having ATMs all over the place.
