Sorry to drag this thread up but I&amp;#039;ve just been on the phone with Barclays and am hence angry again.     What a pile of shit.     Their online banking just doesn&amp;#039;t work properly any more. If you log in without your poxy calculator (in onder to just see your balance/statement) then you&amp;#039;re made to enter a temporary password that should let you log in again for the rest of the day, or something.     What actually happens is you can&amp;#039;t log in at all. I never even get asked for the password, just my entire body of account information before being spat out to the homepage. I called the provided phone number again to discuss this. Unfortunately, through the crackly line and appalling English of &amp;#039;Dave&amp;#039; (or whatever),I managed to ascertain that they had no idea how it works.     I had a pointless argument with &amp;#039;Dave&amp;#039; where he tried to explain that I  need  to have my poxy security device every time I log in, which of course isn&amp;#039;t true. That&amp;#039;s kind of the point. So I finally relented and let him walk me through the process of logging in, despite the shame. When I got to the end and read him the message I was given, he explained that I&amp;#039;d have to use the security device. On pointing out that I didn&amp;#039;t have it, which we&amp;#039;d discussed several times and was in fact the whole subject and reason for the conversation, he explained that in order to log in without it, I&amp;#039;d first need to log in with it. Then I could log in without it.     I did ever so well at staying calm and the only service he could offer was to put me through to another incompetent who would apparently be able to tell me my balance over the phone.     I hung up and instead tried to ring the standard barclays number - after going through various options I received a message informing me that unfortunately a technical error meant they couldn&amp;#039;t put me through to anyone. Cool.     I did of course try emailing a complaint about a month ago to explain the problems. Maybe they&amp;#039;ll reply in time. Maybe not.     Is &amp;#039;disgusting&amp;#039; too strong a word for their customer service or am I just angry?     Either way, I&amp;#039;m putting this off no longer. I&amp;#039;m voting with my cash and shall be cancelling my account and going elsewhere.      Bastards.
