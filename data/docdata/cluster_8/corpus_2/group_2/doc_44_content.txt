I want to subscribe to a good sports channel so that I can get  all the Barclays matches as well as some Champions league action. I have a TV tuner in my laptop but I would prefer a broadband service. Please help me on the same.       Thanking you      P.S : Sorry for the off topic.                      I think Setanta has a broadband service if that&amp;#039;s what you&amp;#039;re looking for.
