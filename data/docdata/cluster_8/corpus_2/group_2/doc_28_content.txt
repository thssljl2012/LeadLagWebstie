Also, if many companies adopted the same practice, then those high-quality people wouldn&amp;#039;t have any option of where to go, would they?      I think the next two years will see a tremendous shift in the way that investment banking bosses in particular are paid.  Just a hunch.                      Up until last night I was optimistic that some change would happen, however now I suspect it will shortly be business as usual with the taxpayer footing the bill once again.  Since the investment banks are being swept inside the retail operations will Barclays, for example, allow Lehmans staff to continue as before?  I&amp;#039;m betting the changes won&amp;#039;t be huge unless there&amp;#039;s a major change in the way big corporations are financed.
