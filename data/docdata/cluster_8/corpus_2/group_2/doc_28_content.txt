  Hold on, are you saying you paid in cash (just cash, not cash and cheques) into a current account late on a Friday (i.e. Monday morning) and you can&amp;#039;t get it until Wednesday? That&amp;#039;s terrible.     You really need to change banks.  Any reason why you wouldn&amp;#039;t want to switch? If not, do it today.
