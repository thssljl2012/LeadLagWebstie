No way!!      What I&amp;#039;m saying was that until we were pissed off by the AFL in 2006 over the heritage guernsey issue, we didn&amp;#039;t want to rock the boat. Part of that was because our financial position was  poor and the AFL was guarantor for up to $1.1mil of our loans/debts with the Commonwealth Bank as at 31 December 2004, and that we were prepared to accept some of the crap from the AFL. The bank guarantee was down to $250k at at 31 October 2007. How many of you are aware of this situation? I have AFL annual reports from 2004 onwards.      There are 9 other clubs who have bank guarantees with the AFL. I put all this info in this post in July on the main board. As you will see plenty of Vic clubs have a $5mil guarantee from the AFL to their bankers.       http://www.bigfooty.com/forum/showpo...6&amp;amp;amp;postcount=55       I think the 2006 heritage issue was a turning point that enough was enough. They knew they couldn&amp;#039;t turn things around straight away with the AFL, but they started chipping away at it. Plus we the fans started telling them in 2006 and 2007. People who went to last year&amp;#039;s AGM mentioned on here and the TPFP that the club had got the message about our branding and marketing and that it was too late to change for 2008 but for 2009 a move back to our history, heritage and tradition was on the cards.      Little things like the AFL 2006 book vs the AFL 2007 (and 2008) book started  to change.      In 2006   CLUB FORMED: 1996   JOINED AFL: 1997      In 2007 and 2008   CLUB FORMED: Port Adelaide FC formed May 13, 1870: joined SANFL 1877: AFL club incorporated 1996.   JOINED AFL: 1997      (technically the AFL Club was incorporated March 1995 as PORT ADELAIDE FOOTBALL CLUB (A.F.L.) LIMITED, changed it&amp;#039;s name to PORT ADELAIDE FOOTBALL CLUB LIMITED in November 1995, on 21 May 1996 the AFL Commission said Port were in the comp in 1997 and on 26 November 1996 the sub licence with the SANFL was signed after 2 months negotiating the terms and conditions of the sub licence.)
