I have 9 insurance companies that I represent and AIG is one of them.  Just so you know how shitty they are in two years I have not sold a policy for them because their insurance rates are ridiculously high! It has become so bad I don&amp;#039;t even bother quoting them, especially now.  They are just a shitty company why bail em out?     Probably because they&amp;#039;re the 18th largest corporation in the world.  AIG?  Really?  Well I&amp;#039;m sure someone like Citibank the largest in teh world assett wise could buy them.  Not to mention Citibank is looking into getting into the insurance end of things.   Great. Cause Citicorp has been doing SO wonderful that middle eastern tyrants and the chinese had to buy controlling shares.....  Getting new dollars into a company doesn&amp;#039;t mean it&amp;#039;s doing bad.
