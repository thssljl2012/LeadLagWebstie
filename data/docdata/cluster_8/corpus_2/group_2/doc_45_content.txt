 I know lots of people who bank with Lloyds TSB.  Some of them probably have excellent credit, others have no credit at all or shaky credit.  And I&amp;#039;ve never even heard of anyone getting a Lloyds Current Account and NOT being given an OD limit of 250 or more.  Do they just automatically give you 250 even if you have no credit history?  Seems that way.  Interesting....
