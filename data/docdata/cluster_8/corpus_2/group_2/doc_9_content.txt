  Melinda: here is an article addressing your issue:    http://www.fool.com/investing/dividends-income/2008/09/15/are-annuities-at-risk.aspx    I&amp;#039;m not sure it will be of much comfort. There is no reason to think that AZ is in trouble. But they are in the same business as AIG. AZ is a German company, and had a nasty relationship with the Nazi&amp;#039;s but that doesn&amp;#039;t have any effect on their current financial stability. The insurance companies are in trouble because they have invested in mortgage backed securities which are now being downgraded and revalued. I have no doubt that AZ has some of this paper also. If it is of any comfort,I have worked with German companies and they are VERY conservative compared with American companies. It&amp;#039;s a shame you have been locked in like that. If you really want out you might try to get the company to wave the penalty. A letter to the board saying you were hoodwinked into the contract with a copy to the WSJ might do the trick. These companies HATE bad publicity.   AZ reported in April, and while their profit was way down, they did NOT lose money:    http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;amp;sid=agKr1y4Nb2Ao&amp;amp;amp;refer=home    and there was an update here:    http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/allianz-quarterly-net-falls-insurer/story.aspx?guid=%7B3A603273%2D8B8E%2D4E6A%2DA593%2DE91AE2A7960D%7D&amp;amp;amp;siteid=yhoof    but still profitable.   Notice he said a run rate &amp;#039;before banking&amp;#039;.   Send an email to Oliver Suess in Munich and ask him what he thinks of AZ&amp;#039;s stability:    osuess@bloomberg.net      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz     http://www.allianz.com/en/index.html    Try calling Oliver Schmidt on the phone:    http://www.allianz.com/en/allianz_group/investor_relations/contact/page1.html    Forbes thinks AZ may profit from the AIG disaster:    http://www.forbes.com/2008/09/16/europe-insurance-aig-markets-equity-cx_ll_0916markets12.html?partner=yahootix    If you want to get a feel for the company watch this:    http://www.thomson-webcast.net/de/dispatching/?event_id=c7e5dca05d95e1d1e459562a48f88cee&amp;amp;amp;portal_id=1d93ddb2840d0c7adc17794bfa975b3b    and look at the slides.   Don&amp;#039;t be a shrinking violet. They have your dough. Stand up and be counted.   :-)
