It&amp;#039;s the Feds that have taken control of the area, and the reason they are not allowing information to get out is because they fear that it will strain financial markets. AIG specifically would be bankrupted with large death tolls and costs. The federal government IS covering this up.        Is this still the United States of America? I don&amp;#039;t even recognize this country anymore.
