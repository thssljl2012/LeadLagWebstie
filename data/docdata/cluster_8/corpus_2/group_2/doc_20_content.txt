      None of these companies should be getting bailed out. Part of capitalism is inherent risk, and these companies got cocky and are now paying the price. I say let it be an example to others that would potentially do the same.                                              __________________               Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  shreddersteve                         The deal with a republic democracy versus non-endocrinactic reformicy is a complex and restrictive paradox.
