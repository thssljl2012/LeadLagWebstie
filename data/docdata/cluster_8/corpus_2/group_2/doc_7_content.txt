         Being a civically minded nutter surrounded by a population John Corey clones obviously in need of protection from themselves, I saw it as my duty to wake the Reserve Bank of Australia.  I wrote to them in 2006 showing them the causes of the debt dung heap and the likely timing, magnitude and outcome.  Being limited to the role of bankers to the Commonwealth of Australia they did what they could; raised the target cash rate which may have reduced private sector borrowing a little.  While on the topic of nutters remaking the world, I lay claim authorship of the modern usage of the term &amp;amp;quot;bubble&amp;amp;quot;. In late 1998 / early 1999 while in the USA conversations would rapidly converge on the hot topic .com shares. &amp;amp;quot;Bubble&amp;amp;quot; sez I. Vacant look with hand readied to reach for the cheque book, &amp;amp;quot;What&amp;#039;s Bubble?&amp;amp;quot; asks they. &amp;amp;quot;South Sea Bubble?&amp;amp;quot; sez I. Quizzical vacant looks.  You Moo Cows should have more respect for us Nutters - we have your best interest at heart even when you don&amp;#039;t.
