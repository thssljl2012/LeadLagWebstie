Barclays Knee-jerk fraud prevention. They&amp;#039;ve frozen my debit card and then informed me of this by MAIL.  Reason for freezing the debit card? Two European transactions in 2 days. Feckin Blizzard subs followed by impulse purchase of Swiss watches. There&amp;#039;s me wondering why the watches haven&amp;#039;t been DHL&amp;#039;d to my door yet. Cue telephone conversation with Fraud detection team during which I am asked for the last 4 digits of the barcode from the packet of cornflakes I ate last June, my father&amp;#039;s waist size and the rough diameter of a smartie...or questions equally as tricky to answer.    I appreciate that they have these safeguards in place but it&amp;#039;s got to the point where I can&amp;#039;t even spend my hard-earned (lol) wedge without alarm bells going off somewhere.
