Sorry about the insurance, Jules.  AIG scares me because they don&amp;#039;t even know how to take care of the company.  Any company that needs a &amp;quot;bailout&amp;quot; is not somewhere that I would want to hold my insurance.  I don&amp;#039;t like insurance companies at all (shhh...don&amp;#039;t tell my boss!)
