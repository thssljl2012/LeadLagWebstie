  I am in a similar position to Sandy W7 in that I have a mortgage offer and it states that it is valid until 30th April 09. ( I posted about this earlier)     I cannot find anything in the attached literature that says they can pull the offer back.     The product the offer was made on no longer exists and I haven&amp;#039;t had a call yet from the applications team saying need to change - prior to the offer letter I had to move products twice due to them changing mid way through the application process.     I can&amp;#039;t see how the bank could get away with changing things once an offer has gone out as they would potentially need to re underwrite everyone to make sure they could afford the new deal and depending on how long remortgage takes this could happen multiple times in the current climate.     On the topic of the Rate cut there was an article in the gaurdian that said Woolwich / Barclays would be passing on the rate cut and would continue to to track the BOE rate     Cheers     Paul
