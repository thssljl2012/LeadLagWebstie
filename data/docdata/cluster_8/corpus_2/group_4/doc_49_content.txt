I have a very good cash flow and use my debit card for everything. I never go overdrawn and know exactly what I have to spend each month with a buffer in place. Why would I need a credit card? Would I already have a good credit rating in place if I have never been overdrawn and just had a consistent amount of money coming in?    I have always ignored credit cards and know very little about them, but presume that there is very little benefit to using one if I have good cash flow and can pay for things outright with my debit card?    Advice is welcomed, I cba to start a new thread sorry
