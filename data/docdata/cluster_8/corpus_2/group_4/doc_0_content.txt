     Quote:                                 Quoting  M&amp;#039;sta Mikey                          You can claim anything you wish. However, unless you can PROVE the facts regarding your co-worker, its just hearsay; you said, he said, she said. All of which can be denied and goes unproven.    What solid, undisputed proof do you have that contradicts the statements of your district manager? And as cbg stated, without a valid contract, CBA or employment agreement, you are not &amp;amp;quot;protected&amp;amp;quot;.                      I didnt talk with the district manager yet but my coworker who is also a good friend of mine told me she just got verbally told to be more carefull....    I have proof that they dont have the rule written anywhere, i have proof that the same manager wrote me up 3 times in 30 days(The store manager tried denying this and saying that the same manager didnt write me up.....), and i have proof that i wasnt told to get the check approved. For the past 8 months since that counseling, the store manager claims to have told us in huddles to get personal checks signed by management. However i have been doing the same thing which is getting t charts but not managers signatures since that counseling. So they never told me to get them signed.....Besides shes had 8 months to add it up to the layaway procedure board and she hasnt added it yet. So it just makes her look bad for using that argument.    I can flip it around too though by saying do they have proof the check is mine other than saying i saw your register numbers on the back???? They told me they would show me the check but it never happened.    If you accuse someone of wrongdoing you have to show their fault and if you cant then its just he said, she said and its my word vs hers.
