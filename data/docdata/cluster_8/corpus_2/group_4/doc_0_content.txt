It also means that the insurer is insuring for a whole property worth $1million but only collecting premiums for $100K. So if let&amp;#039;s say your garden gets damaged by fire and repairs cost $100K, they will only pay you $10K pro-rated. This is because the whole house is covered in the insurance and not just one part of the house.                      wow, so chao one arh?  didn&amp;#039;t know that...  like that if i insure for 150% of the house and the whole house burn to the ground how to count?
