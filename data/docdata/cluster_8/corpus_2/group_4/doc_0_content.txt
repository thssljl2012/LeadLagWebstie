AIG is a big black hole, they have already gone through 90 billion of the 125 billion bailout and it is just the end of October 2008. Where the hell is the money? They need to fire sale all the assets at AIG and stop taking tax payers money. What a rip to the tax payer. Right now my company business is slowing down because of construction and housing market. So layoffs are coming. I am taking some night classes to see if I can get into the medical field. I have a good computer background but cannot find anything there lately. so i am trying to diversify.     Good question. It sounds like there is more to what is said to the media. They kept saying that only the mortgage business has a problem. Why then layoff from other divisions? It looks like they need more than what they already borrow from the taxpayers. They need to layoff many people all over the world to cover for the rest of the money they need. My family and I are canceling all our insurance from AIG. We heard friends and family doing the same. It&amp;#039;s not worth doing business with a company whose MISSION IS DRIVEN BY GREED, POOR JUDGEMENT and LACK of concern to the workforce. The FOCUS of the company is in its MANAGEMENT not even the shareholders. The REWARD is at the top for the MANAGEMENT while they drive the company to the ground.
