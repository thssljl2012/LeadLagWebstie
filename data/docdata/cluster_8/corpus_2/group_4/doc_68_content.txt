Splicer, thanks for explaining the demise of the Big 3 auto sector... Gee, the union dumped a ton money to elect Obama. He will&amp;amp;nbsp; mandate EFCA which&amp;amp;nbsp;was &amp;amp;nbsp;the only hope for the union bosses have to suck up the membership dues. The problem is...There are zero jobs for these marginal skilled workers.. Well, take you for example, if you had little union seniority, how could work those 800 OT hours.. BTW, you would be on the Verizon surplus list.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    My point is....Walmart business structure will do well during this economic downturn... The union controlled companies..ie auto, steel will be downsized AGAIN...            &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;   THERE A STILL PLENTY OF JOBS, WITH DECENT SALARIES, FOR THOSE WITH SKILLS. I&amp;#039;VE BEEN IN A POSITION WHERE I WAS DECLARED SURPLUS, THAT&amp;#039;S WHY I CHANGED TO ANOTHER POSITION. WALMARTS &amp;quot;BUSINESS STRUCTURE&amp;quot; MAY DO WELL, BUT IT&amp;#039;S EMPLOYEES WILL CONTINUE TO SUFFER WITH SUBSTANDARD WAGES AND MINIMAL BENEFITS. WHAT DOES SENIORITY HAVE TO DO WITH OT HOURS? READ TH CBA, SENIORITY DOES NOT EFFECT OT HOURS, TRAINING AND QUALIFICATIONS ARE THE ONLY FACTOR THAT GIVES ONE EMPLOYEE PRIORITY OVER ANOTHER. KEEP SHOWING YOUR IGNORANCE.
