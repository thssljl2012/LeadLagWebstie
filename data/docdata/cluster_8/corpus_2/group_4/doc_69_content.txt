Usually, they can tell straight off if it is even worth the repair. Also, if they do decide to repair, you are going to take a huge hit in depreciation...do you plan on getting a compensation for that? If the insurance company takes in the depreciation compensation plus repairs, there is a HUGE possibility they total it instead. But, you really should voice this deprec. compensation now instead of after their decision, in case they decide to repair, it will become more complicated for you.      Also, I meant to send my condolences as well to you about your father. I&amp;#039;ll raise my glass to him this weekend.                      My Dad would love your you to raise a glass for him, thanks!!      I spoke with USAA about filing a &amp;quot;diminished value&amp;quot; claim.  They made it sound as though that was standard operating procedure and that the girls insurance company (AIG) would be expecting that.
