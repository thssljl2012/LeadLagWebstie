    A simple revolving B$25 loan - along &amp;amp;nbsp;with a $10,000 Tax credit for US. Auto purchases only would fix this problem so quick that your head would spin.... And yes , Like it or not&amp;amp;nbsp;--&amp;amp;nbsp;it sure ain&amp;#039;t a Bailout that GM &amp;amp;amp; Ford want - try a simple revolving credit line for $25 Billion... but as far as Chrysler its already too late ask Nardelli ---&amp;amp;nbsp;that $25 Billion &amp;amp;nbsp;is nuttin&amp;#039; compared to the B$750 Bailout that Goldman, Morgan, Citi &amp;amp;amp; the Big Nine banks were forced to take.. Just ask yourself is AIG&amp;#039;s $85 Billion really more important than&amp;amp;nbsp;GM or Ford&amp;#039;s survival - with more&amp;amp;nbsp;than the 3-Million jobs plus local &amp;amp;nbsp;taxes &amp;amp;amp; med. benee&amp;#039;s for everyone...Hey AIG is just another insurance company &amp;amp;amp; who needs 1000 banks -&amp;amp;nbsp;noOne but &amp;amp;nbsp;Paulsen &amp;amp;amp; Goldman to stiff their trades&amp;amp;nbsp;eh?.
