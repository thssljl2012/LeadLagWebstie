Okay, if you insist, we&amp;#039;ll do it your way.      There is no law in any state that is going to require your employer to allow you to take your vacation. They may or may not have to pay any unused vacation out at termination (in your state it depends on company policy) but use it or lose it policies are not illegal in Arizona and if they are allowing you to roll over half your vacation time that&amp;#039;s more than the law requires. Barring a bona fide contract or CBA that expressly says otherwise, it is alway, in all 50 states, up to the employer to determine at what time employees can take vacation. While some states have laws regarding the pay out of unused vacation at termination, no state has any laws that give you the right to decide when you can take it without employer approval.      Now, since FMLA is a Federally protected concept and since the birth of a child is a legally protected reason to take FMLA, if you&amp;#039;ll answer my question we can see if you can get some time off that way.
