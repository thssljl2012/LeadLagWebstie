            Hey guys ,  I once checked with my insurance carrier at the time (AIG) and they informed that I would have to return the plates,  show them the proof that you surrendered the plates and then they would take the liability coverage off your policy.  Not sure about the comprehensive and collision ,  I would assume you would take collision off as well and just leave the comprehensive.   I am considering this as well since I have a DD and I haven&amp;#039;t driven the S since the D4D meet.  As for the storage process I am considering buying some 5lb bags of silica to toss into the cabin/trunk/engine bay to keep the moisure away, changing the oil and hooking the battery up to a trickle charger.  Anyway theres a ton of threads on S2KI relating to winter storage , some more crazy than the other .  Anyway JM2C.                   --------------------
