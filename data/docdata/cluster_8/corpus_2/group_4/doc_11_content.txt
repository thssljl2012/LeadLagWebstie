     Hi Ryanhunt          Im glad youre thinking of doing this with a Foreign Exchange broker and youre right to take advantage of the current weak dollar.           The payment plan youre enquiring about is called a Regular Payment Plan whereby a Forex broker direct debits your account and credits your beneficiary account with the Australian Dollar equivalent every month.  Most brokers offer you the option of either fixing the exchange rate or going on a variable plan whereby the rate you get changes every month depending on the rate at the time of the transfer. As the dollar is weak, it is quite a good time to fix the rate.  Fees for this service range from 4 to 15 depending on the currency broker.  We currently charge 4 per month for the plan.          Also certain brokers have partnerships with banks in Australia which means you can set up your account from the UK.  For example, we work with National Australia Bank (NAB) so we would take down your details and they will call you and open your account within a day or so.  Currently, you will be looking at interest rates of around 5%.            Have a look at their website to see what the charges are and other options if you are looking to save such as fixed term deposits.  With the UK looking to slash interest rates even more in the next few weeks, its worth investing the money in countries abroad that offer higher interest rates.          Please let me know if you need any further information.          Mina Rzouki      , Quality Service Manager, Moneycorp,  www.moneycorp.com
