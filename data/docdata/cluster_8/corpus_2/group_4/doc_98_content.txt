It&amp;#039;s good for Barclay&amp;#039;s shareholders as their shares and voting won&amp;#039;t be diluted by the government owning lots of shares and selling them in one big lot...  government involvement in private companies is generally a disaster for the private company and only to be done if you are seriousy up sh*t creek.      For customers...  hard to say, maybe not as good for interest rates in the short term but at least their money is safe.
