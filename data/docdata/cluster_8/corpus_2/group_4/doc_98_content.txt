    Mary:  I really want to support Obama...but extremist views like this can tell a lot of people off.......................  Racism is not eliminated.....You can not control what people think and believe..you can only educate and hopefully attitudes change. The election does not change this.  However, it is a little hard to suggest that we are a racist contry when the person holding the highest office in the land has African American Heritage.  Fact is....Racism in America has regressed to a few extremist and is hidding among the mind and hearts of those people.....Most people voted for Obama because they believed he was the right man for the job.   Then how do you account for major corporations STILL losing racial discrimination lawsuits ? Kroger paid out over 12 million dollars within the last 6 months. How about insurance agencies like Nationwide that lost a huge class action racial discrimination suit. You remember what happened to Denny&amp;#039;s don&amp;#039;t you ?  Don&amp;#039;t get it twisted. Racism isn&amp;#039;t as isolated as you might think.
