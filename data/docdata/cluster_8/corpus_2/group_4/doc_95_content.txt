 All of my family used to be with Commonwealth Bank, but we have all changed in the last decade for one reason or another. For me Commonwealth gave next to no freedom for me as I spend a lot of time working overseas.      Correct me if I&amp;#039;m wrong, but are St. George and Westpac not combining in the very near future??   I have a St. George account at the moment, but as I do little with banking in Australia I cannot really comment on their merits.   I do know however that they passed my details on to numerous marketing companies, and somehow they were able to bypass the &amp;#039;Do Not Call Register&amp;#039; (which you should sign up for the minute you arrive in Australia to avoid all those telemarketers from India). I had to deal with dozens of phone calls EVERY DAY until I filed a formal complaint with St. George.   Just something to be aware of - banks in Australia are a bit dodgy sometimes.
