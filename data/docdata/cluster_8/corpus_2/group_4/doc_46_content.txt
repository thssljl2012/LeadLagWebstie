Neither myself nor any other F/A believes that I should make as much as a pilot, 2 completely different crafts and responsabilities. However I do believe in fair pay and fair increases. If the company can fork out lets say 5% for pilots, then I would say giving the F/A group 5% is fair. 5% for you is alot more than 5% for me, thats what I consider fair. Delta pilots received 23 month furlough protection as part of the merger, why can&amp;#039;t I also have that?      AFA has included the MEE TOO scope in their CBA&amp;#039;s in the past, and I believe that its a possibility they will continue that.
