Go get the bad guys and leave law abiding people alone with your inane fixation of collection measly little amounts to justify your jobs.                      Holy crap, I can&amp;#039;t even believe I made it through this whole thread without stopping 10 times to respond but since I did, I don&amp;#039;t have the time or inclination to address all of the posts I was going to.  Grons, I&amp;#039;m not picking on you, yours just happened to be one of the last posts and the easiest to address in the shortest and most obvious way.      How were the CBA supposed to know they weren&amp;#039;t dealing with &amp;amp;quot;cigarette smuglers&amp;amp;quot; or any other smuggler or criminal  without  a search?    How are they supposed to &amp;#039;get the bad guys&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;leave law abiding people alone&amp;#039; without such random searches?  Do you think they have special powers that allow them to know the &amp;#039;good guys&amp;#039; from the &amp;#039;bad guys&amp;#039; inuitively?  If they operated by your logic (for lack of a better word, cuz there is no logic there) they&amp;#039;d never be able to &amp;#039;get the bad guys&amp;#039;.        Seriously, we all want them to get the bad guys and not the good guys but how do you propose they do that without occassionally having to inconvenience the good guys by searching?  How do you propose they determine who the good guys are without investigating?        Once again, a lot of complaining about what was done but no constructive ideas on what better could be done....same old same old.  Catch the bad guys...but don&amp;#039;t ask me how...uh huh...that works...
