         Hello Precinct   And here we have 1/3rd of another of the better British companies being sold off abroad.   Barclays management are not idiots and must have weighed up the pro&amp;#039;s and cons of Browns money or ME money. Given that the interest rate on both are a whopping thirteen or fourteen percent the difference of one percent hardly matters. What matters is probably hidden in the small print but it&amp;#039;s a no-brainer that Barclays new partners can and will front up with as much money they require in the future. Sure beats being part nationalised by BrownCo.  Regards Harmy
