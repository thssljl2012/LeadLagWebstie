 I called Costello insurance today for a quote.  Boy was I suprised.  For an antique ASW-15 it&amp;#039;s  just under a thousand dollars a year.  Other club members, with more expensive gliders and less experience  than I have, get insurance for half of what I was quoted.  Costello  gets insurance through AIG.  I guess with their government bailout,  minus the expenses from the warm sunny california executive party,  they must need a good chunk of change for their operation.    Does anyone know of other glider insurance companies out there?
