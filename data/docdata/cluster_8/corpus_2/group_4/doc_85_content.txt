         Losses at Europe&amp;#039;s biggest bank, HSBC, relating to the US housing market crisis reached $4.3bn (2.7bn) in the third quarter.  Insurance giant AIG is to get fresh financial help from the US government, which will bring the total aid package for the firm to about $150bn (94bn).  These figures are just staggering and are just the latest announcements.  It makes you wonder, were ANY decent mortgages issued in the last year? If you or I did your job this badly, we wouldn&amp;#039;t expect someone else to bail us out and if you go overdrawn the bank writes to you and instructs you to manage your finances better in the future and charge you for sending the letter.  Rant over
