Quote:                         Did I read that right that you have an apartment worth $7.5m... as in million... I could see on Wallstreet, but this apartment is where?    And olny... what was it... $77k in martgage? And you say you will pay day-to-day expenses with poker? You can be pulling in almost a cool quarter million annually in interest if you manage it properly. I suggest not asking us about your plan... what does your financial adviser say?                     It&amp;#039;s in South Perth, on the foreshore in Perth Western Australia and it is some of the most in demand realestate in Australia, for the simple reason that your view will never be built out, and the apartment was built by Zorzi group who are in the top echelon of builders in Western Australia.    The mortgage is small because I paid a huge chunk of it off by selling some macquarie bank shares.    Also I used to have a financial adviser through Commonwealth Bank but he was a useless c*nt, and I gave myself better advice by doing my own research
