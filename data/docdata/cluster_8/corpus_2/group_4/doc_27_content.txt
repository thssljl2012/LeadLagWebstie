no not very cool, here&amp;#039;s a link that could help       http://www.cannex.com.au/interest-ra...oan-rates.html       To work out whether a prop is cashflow neutral, best to add 2-3% to the interest rate youre paying then compare to yield.  Negative balance is shortfall, positive is excess.  Assuming youve borrowed 100% that is and land tax does not apply.      I normally calculate the shortfall to a tee via a s&amp;#039;sheet but above is a back of the envelope calc.
