it sounds like a prank, if your card has a suspected fraudulent activity on it you would receive a call from a real person. they pick up unusual transactions via a report that is monitored daily.       I would give the CBA a call and advise them that you have received a prank call. They should be notified, there maybe be others like you out there.         phone 132221
