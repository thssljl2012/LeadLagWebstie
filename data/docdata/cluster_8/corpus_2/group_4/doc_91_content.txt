What does that have to do with the self inflicted housing mess and the fact that the big three auto makers have priced themselves out of the market.    I understand where Barney Frank is coming from. His view is that if we had not spent 1 trillion in Iraq it would be available to give to people who thru their own naivete and greed (and Barney&amp;#039;s uber-liberalism) bought homes that they could not afford, and the rest could be spent to perpetuate the big three&amp;#039;s out of control labor costs. The 1 trillion spent in Iraq has nothing to do with the other two events.
