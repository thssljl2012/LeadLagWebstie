 DocGonzo, I have to say you really don&amp;#039;t understand the implications of a company like AIG going bankrupt.       The whole point of commercial insurance companies the size of AIG is that they take on the financial risk that organizations like your government can&amp;#039;t afford to. You might want to call it gambling, and in one sense that is what they do. But if you have a house in...oh for arguments sake let&amp;#039;s say... southern california...and want to insure it against fire damage...you know, just in case the worst happens...well, I guess you&amp;#039;re right, gamble is one word for it, but a lot of people aren&amp;#039;t going to have a few hundred grand laying around to rebuild their house in the case that the worst happens. That is what insurance is for and they&amp;#039;re paying a LOT in natural disaster claims over the last few years.       Every time a plane crashes, or there is an oil spill to be cleaned up, or there is a natural disaster (hurricane, fire, earthquake etc), or similar, think about exactly how mich that costs. As an example, one claim alone following hurricane Ike cost insurers almost 400million dollars for commercial property damage. One claim. Think about how many people would have been claiming for their damaged property, having to rebuild their homes and businesses. It&amp;#039;s a LOT of money and the government won&amp;#039;t fork over that kind of cash to people who didn&amp;#039;t buy insurance.       You NEED to keep the insurance market afloat, you do not NEED to bail out the auto industry. Learn how insurance works.
