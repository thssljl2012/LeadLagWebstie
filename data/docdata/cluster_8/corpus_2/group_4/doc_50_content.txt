I don&amp;#039;t suppose I can use my EFTPOS card over there can I?             Totally can, all our banks here accept your crazy cards. Its just like being in NZ, only hotter, and with  more stuff that will kill you .         There better not be any snakes in Canberra. I like snakes in theory, I&amp;#039;m not sure if I like them in reality.        I have both credit &amp;amp;amp; EFTPOS cards issued by the ANZ bank so I should be good by the sound of things.    _________________ Must remember to update this damned sig occasionally
