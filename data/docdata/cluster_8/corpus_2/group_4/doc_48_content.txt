Just let me know if you use it then I&amp;#039;ll expect the call and won&amp;#039;t put my foot in it by saying, never heard of them                They&amp;#039;d probably prefer a bank like ANZ who they know - don&amp;#039;t forget it&amp;#039;s the actual owner of the house that chooses you and not the agent. Some of these people may have never have heard of places like the Halifax or Natwest                               Hi Wendy,      Just as well that I opened an account with ANZ then           Thanks   Donna.   x
