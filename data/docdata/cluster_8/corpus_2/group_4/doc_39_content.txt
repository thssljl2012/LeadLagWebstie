  as_long_as_it_runs:   Casa, if you are blaming Bush-II on the Domestics mess, you&amp;#039;re losing some cred here...     Micasa el Magnifico XvX:    Credibility is FIRM my boy... and don&amp;#039;t take it personal just because it sound like U voted for that idiot...   I am not saying that BUSH is responsible for the BIG 3&amp;#039;s situation as it was a long time coming the effects of non-competitive UAW contracts that were signed off on by past and present BIG3 leadership.. but I do blame BUSH for the current economic issues that are not even related to the automakers that in turn do effect the automakers...   U and I are both more than likely not as affected by this economic issues as many others.. but truth is that my business, tho a smidgen less vulnerable to the downturn, is still &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; on the Retail side due to slow demand... causing us to step up marketing on the Service end to compensate... Even some of the businesses we do business with are effected... as they have trouble getting loans to buy new equipment...   I had a $30K deal fall thru because a Doctor&amp;#039;s office we were set to re-do opted out because they couldn&amp;#039;t get financing... they couldn&amp;#039;t pay outta pocket because for SOME REASON their Medical Malpractice Insurance went up to $150K per year after the AIG situation was announced..   YUP... BUSH is a SOB... and defending him is redundant at this point... The Devil will be leaving the building in 1.5 months but his damage will take 2 years to fix.    That&amp;#039;s absolutely nuts that a doctors office couldn&amp;#039;t get financing   . &amp;amp;nbsp;This banking situation has to get sorted quickly. &amp;amp;nbsp;
