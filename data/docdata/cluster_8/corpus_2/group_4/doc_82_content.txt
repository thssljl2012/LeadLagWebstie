My husband had an old Barlcay loan sevreal sevreal years ago that ended up in defalt, hense this went to a CCJ. basically we ended up paying a collection agency the aggreed 20 a month, until September 2005 when we we came into some money and asked for a full and final settlement. As there figure was slightly higher than we could afford we gave them a figure we could afford to which was accepted. Hooray the god knows how old debt was finally paid.      Now we have recently had a letter from a differant collection agency demanding over 6000 saying the debt was never repaid to barclays. As we haven&amp;#039;t got any records any more of the company that we paid the &amp;#039;FULL AND FINAL SETTLEMENT&amp;#039; to we have no idea who to contact to prove payment was made and nothing is owing. We were told that if we can provide a bank statement with the payment made in 2005 then they will wipe the slate but a phone call received today they have now said WE need to contact barcalys to prove the debt is paid and they won&amp;#039;t accept the bank statement. In between all this we have been thretened with court action and bailiff&amp;#039;s.      I have spoken to my MD at work about this situation and he tells me to just write to them refuting claims for monies as the debt was paid over 3yr&amp;#039;s ago and THEY have to prove we owe the debt. But as we have had threats to which will distroy our credit rating which we have worked really hard on the last 2 yr&amp;#039;s to correct I don&amp;#039;t just want to leave it.     Could someone help me as to what i should do next and what legal rights have I got?                        Would you be able to get hold of an old bank statement to prove that you made the payment? Your bank should hold records for the past six years.         This is quite a common problem with full and finals, as often the amount is paid and accepted, however the creditor makes an admin error and the remainder of the balance does not get cleared as agreed.         Can you remember which collection agency you paid the full and final payment to? It may be worth contacting them and asking for a subject access request. The collection agency then will have to provide you with all the notes on your old account. Hopefully there will be some note made on the account to back up that you have been offered the amount so this along with proof of payment should be enough to back up your case.
