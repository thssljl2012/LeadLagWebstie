That you can blame on Obama and the democrats. Investors have to look at the futre, not just the present.       Ralston, the dip was about 1000 points over the next 2 days after Obama was elected and hasn&amp;#039;t been as high since. You can&amp;#039;t blow that off as being insignificant when it was one of the largest if not the largest percentage drop. Drudgereport had a link to a chart that showed this and I didn&amp;#039;t saved it so I&amp;#039;m relying on memory.        http://moneycentral.msn.com/investor...indu&amp;amp;amp;CP=0&amp;amp;amp;PT=4                           So what? Markets have been jittery for a fair while now, up  and  down, for the simple fact that there is a large amount of uncertainty over the face of the future economy and it&amp;#039;s direction. In the past few weeks I&amp;#039;ve seen shares of Rolls-Royce jump up and down by over 20%, seesawing crazily.        The reaction to Obama&amp;#039;s election has shit-all to do with the prophecy of the markets and everything to do with him being an unknown factor: Markets are punishing unknown risks right now as people become risk averse (look at shares of Barclays for a justified example) and Obama is just one more potential unknown. I wouldn&amp;#039;t base anything on that.               Or to put it another way: In economics, cause and effect can go both ways, or not at all. Try not to politicize it.
