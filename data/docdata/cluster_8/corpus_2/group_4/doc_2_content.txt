How have the government stepped in forcibly?  RBS and HBOS weren&amp;#039;t forced by the government to take what was on offer - they were forced to take it by their own incompetence.  The fact that Barclays was able to turn up its nose at what the government was offering and raise capital to cover their incompetence elsewhere is proof of that.        I have no problem with that, what I have a problem with is raising capital that&amp;#039;s a bad deal for customers and shareholders just so that the top executives there can pay themselves their huge bonuses.  In theory, the market should sort this out and a shareholder revolt, but in reality, who are the biggest shareholders in Barclays?  Other top level executives who shall we say, have a bit of empathy with Diamond et al.
