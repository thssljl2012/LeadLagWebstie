Other club members, with more expensive gliders and less experience   than I have, get insurance for half of what I was quoted. *Costello   gets insurance through AIG. *I guess with their government bailout,   minus the expenses from the warm sunny california executive party,   they must need a good chunk of change for their operation.     Does anyone know of other glider insurance companies out there?      Just under $1k could be a bargain, you don&amp;#039;t state your experience or  experience on type. Did you get all the applicable discounts? Costello  will apply discounts for SSA and AOPA memberships. Your current  experience/proficiency determined by the number of landings (not  hours) you&amp;#039;ve flown (I think its is total and in the last year). You  also can get credit for commercial ratings.    Other insurance companies advertise in SSA Soaring Magazine. I have no  experience with them.    You can also lower costs somewhat by taking the glider off-line over  winter and reducing insured value, but obviously there are risks in  that. BTW we recently had a nice Cobra trailer destroyed in California  in a rollover accident, the glider was not in the trailer and the car  driver was fine. One of the Cobra dealers mentioned to me that the  trailers are often significantly underinsured.      Darryl
