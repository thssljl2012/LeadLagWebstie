 I don&amp;#039;t think everyone realizes just how totally flipped out the USA would be if AIG had not been bailed out.&amp;amp;nbsp; Do you realize how many LARGE insurance companies fall under the umbrella of AIG?&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; AIG backs a large portion of the insurance companies in here in the states.&amp;amp;nbsp; Unless I am wrong, and I could be AAA insurance is even covered under AIG.&amp;amp;nbsp; IF AIG had gone down, an awful lot of people would have absolutely NO INSURANCE of any kind.&amp;amp;nbsp; Insurance that had been worked for, paid for and counted on.&amp;amp;nbsp; This includes health insurance, life insurance, car insurance, not to mention securities.&amp;amp;nbsp; MASSIVE mistake.&amp;amp;nbsp; Regardless of the stupid behavior of those exec&amp;#039;s the Fed&amp;#039;s could not allow AIG to go under.&amp;amp;nbsp; Before you say let &amp;#039;er rip, better call &amp;amp;amp; see if YOUR insurance (any of it) is covered under that AIG umbrella.&amp;amp;nbsp;
