                   [quote=Hooloovoo;28580706]Should have picked a base rate tracker!   /QUOTE]      This seems strange to me but a work colleague of mine has a Barclays/Woolwich tracker mortgage and has just been told by her mortgage advisor in categoric terms that even though the tracker mortgage she owns tracks the BoE base rate, B/W are not obliged to pass any today&amp;#039;s rate drop on ...       Methinks this is bad advice and legally B/W have no leg to stand on.
