Horse quality will go up.                              And what has that got to do with &amp;#039;never&amp;#039;?  That was my point.  Yeah, those other firms are tearing them up right now, with the decrease in competition.     So if you cut the number of races in half..the purse structure on the remaining races will be a certain lock to increase to twice the original amount?  Are you sure about that?
