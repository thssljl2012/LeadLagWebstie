  Im in the its gonna get worse before it gets better camp........  I think the Mercant Wan...Bankers should all be made to forfit their bonuses  until they pay us back every penny we have lent them!!!!  More worrying is the fact that Barclays would rather sell a third of their company to the Sheikh&amp;#039;s in Abu Dhabi...... Rather than be subject to the let&amp;#039;s face it the crappy little controls the government was asking for in exchange for our Tax money,  I wonder how many millions the Chair of Barclays has had his palm greased with................ How long before they buy it all.....  Then what will happen..... I leave the rest of that to your imagination but what a foothold and control that gives an unknown entity from the Middle East over one of our largest financial institutions.
