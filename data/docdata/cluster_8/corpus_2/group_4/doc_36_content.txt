No, it is not illegal to terminate you for &amp;amp;quot;allegedly&amp;amp;quot; closing early whether you did or not.  You can be terminated for any reason at any time except a reason prohibited by law (ie age, religion, gender) or unless you have a bona fide employment contract or CBA to the contrary.      It&amp;#039;s just like you could have quit at any time for any reason w/o a contract to the contrary.      File for unemployment ins. &amp;amp;amp; look for other employment.  Good luck.
