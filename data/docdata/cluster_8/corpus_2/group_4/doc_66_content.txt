 Hey Daniel      I&amp;#039;m 24 and started investing around the age of 18 but have only been investing with serious amounts of money the last year. Whilst it is preferable to do some paper trading and gain some knowledge it might also be a good idea to dip your toes in water and also make a few investments. Nothing forces you to learn faster then by actually entering the market. That being said, know your limits (i.e risk level and time frame). If you are happy to have a 3+ year time frame and can take some losses in the next few months know might be a good time to make a small investment. There are currently some very solid blue chips on the market which are trading at a very large discounts. Also if you are to invest, invest in something you know. My first investment ever was in CBA because I did my banking with them, so I at least knew a bit about the way their business operated.      Good luck!
