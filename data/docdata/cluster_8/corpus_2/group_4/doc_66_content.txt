imshredin2 case in point your return post to another poster who distorts News. &amp;quot;It seems people are looking so hard for a villin to blame all this crisis on they don&amp;#039;t really care what the facts are.&amp;quot; ********************************************************** Your Post Let&amp;#039;s get the facts straight. They were LOANED the money at 14% (nice return for the Gov) with 2 years to sell off parts of their 1.2 Trillion in assets to repay the loan. They weren&amp;#039;t mortgage loan makers as much as they just invested in the paper. This new deal gives them a 6% rate and 5 years to pay it back. That takes the pressure off selling at fire sale prices. They are getting Loans because they have the very real ability to pay them back. The majority business of AIG is insurance and that division is doing great and is profitable. The bad PR is due to the business as usual attitude at the insurance unit that is not the root of the problem so they don&amp;#039;t think they should change how they do business. If you don&amp;#039;t take care of the people (agents,sales mgrs, etc) that bring in the business they might take it some where else.
