Agreed, Steve!  As always, there are exceptions and someone who finds themselves in this situation and who has probably been meeting mortgage payments for a good many years would have no problems in meeting loan obligations.  You have no argument from me there!    But the situation where banks give 100% &amp;#039;no money down&amp;#039; loans, particularly to FHBs with little or no savings, has been a bit of a &amp;#039;soapbox issue&amp;#039; for me for a while .... it&amp;#039;s fiscal naivety/incompetence at best (or stupidity at worst) on the part of the borrower and greed on the part of the lender, and - far too often - it ends in tears ..... or on one of those dreadful TV &amp;#039;current affairs&amp;#039; shows!      But the times, they are a&amp;#039;changing ..... and hopefully this is one practice which won&amp;#039;t survive.    Cheers  LynnH
