 Went through the process of opening a A&amp;amp;amp;L Direct account. which was approved but no mention of the overdraft amount.   I&amp;#039;ve now had to phone up and cancel the application as i&amp;#039;m constantly in my overdraft and you have to give a statement showing you have been in credit for at least 2 days a month.(i overlooked this in the t&amp;amp;amp;c&amp;#039;s)   the whole point was to avoid the 35 a month Barclays are charging for my overdraft so i could aim to pay it off, it&amp;#039;s put me off switching altogether
