Hi,  I am about to start a DMP with CCCS and I owe money to (big breath):  Black Horse (Lloyds) Zopa MBNA CO-OP RBS NatWest Nationwide Halifax Post Office Barclays Citi  I need to open a basic bank account that is unconnected with any of the above creditors so that offsetting cannot occur. I have got an account with Abbey but (despite reassurances offered in another post...) I still have jitters about Abbey&amp;#039;s past association with MBNA (probably totally unnecessarily I&amp;#039;m sure!).  I&amp;#039;m about to be paid a few months wages in advance and it would be a disaster if any of my creditors could access these funds. I&amp;#039;m thinking HSBC might be the way to go. Can anyone tell me whether HSBC has any connection with any of my creditors?  Many thanks.
