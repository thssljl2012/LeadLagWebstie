           Well why do you think Black people failed to vote in previous elections?  to them a White person in power didn&amp;#039;t care enough to do something about the state of the nation. I admit Black people could have stood up and protested for change but what&amp;#039;s the point when they&amp;#039;d just get riot policed (since they&amp;#039;re often more aggressive when expressing emotion publically).    Obama solves this, they will listen to him and be a part of America, not just a sideline.    They never had any reason to vote before because the then campaigns never appealed to them or reached out to unite race like Obama&amp;amp;#8217;s campaigning has done.    Black people who just CBA with politics before will actually be bothered by it now and I&amp;amp;#8217;m quite certain that they&amp;amp;#8217;ll follow Obama&amp;amp;#8217;s request when he asked everyone as a whole to help improve their nation instead of being divided as they used to be.
