 I believe the Dems will not let the automakers go bankrupt if at all possible.  As noted above, a bankruptcy will allow the UAW to lose its status with the company, and a whole new game starts.  The reason I believe the Dems will support the auto bailout is that they are heavily beholden to the unions for helping win the election and there is a traditional link between the unions and the Democratic party.     If GM does go bankrupt, the effect will not be as devastating as some may think.  For instance, the stockholders have already lost their equity in the company, the stock approaches zero, in fact Deutschebank and Barclays already rate it at zero.  What happens to the bondholders?  Screwed most likely, which is mainly large pension funds, etc.(they will be plumping for a bailout).  The employees will largely come back or stay as the company must continue to operate or risk really closing for good.  The debt holders and accounts payable will get in line with everyone else(screwed most likely).     Here is a question: what happens to those current GM product owners with warranties?  Also screwed?
