 anyone having this sort of problem?  took out home+contents insurance with nationwide in sept..tracked and validated alright at 70 pretty quickly...in the past few weeks, the amount validated is showing as 0.00 and that has now turned up as 0.00 in the received column. Very confused. No reply to my enquiry on quidco yet..maybe they are waiting for december to pay me and take their fee at the same time.
