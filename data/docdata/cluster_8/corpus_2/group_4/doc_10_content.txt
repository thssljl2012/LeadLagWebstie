           A couple of questions to the ManuLife One customers posting here.   1) Have any of you contacted the Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments ( http://www.cba.ca/en/ViewDocument.as...176&amp;amp;amp;sl=178&amp;amp;amp;tl= ) and gotten a reply? This would seem to be a more independent ombudsman then the Manulife employee.      2) To play Devil&amp;#039;s advocate, if Manulife had instead changed their &amp;amp;quot;Manulife One Prime&amp;amp;quot; such that it was lower then their Prime Rate, would all of you be as upset and complaining about misleading advertising materials?
