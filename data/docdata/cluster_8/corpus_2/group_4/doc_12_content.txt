Your going to bail out these losers who create nothing...but the best thing America has left with respect to manufacturing your not going to bail out?       WHAT PLANET AM I ON?                         Exactly, 25 billion is a pittance compared to the trillions of dollars the US is going to lose, spend, waste on this credit crisis, created by the greed of some on Wall Street.
