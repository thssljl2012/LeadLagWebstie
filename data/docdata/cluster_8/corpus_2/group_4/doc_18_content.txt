  They refused new oem parts when my sister was involved in an accident.  The people were also rude to her.  EDIT: Last year, I was hit by another car twice.  First time, my car was parked and  the guy clipped my front bumper / fender pulling into a spot headfirst.  Cop was behind him and found him at-fault.  Went directly through his insurance (AIG) and had the most difficult time.  Told me that I should consider myself lucky since he replaced my bumper.  Said that it should have been filled with bondo.  Second time, lady pulled out and hit my car.  She was found at fault as indicated in a police report.  Went to her insurance (NJ Manufacturers) and they sent an adjuster to my house in two days.  I already had damage on the bumper, so they deducted &amp;amp;#036;40, but wrote me an estimate based on factory parts.  I had a check in my hand in two days.  Wish I worked for a NJ partner company to be eligible.  I&amp;#039;ve Allstate for years but never filed a claim.  However, I spoke with my agent after a member here had a terrible experience with them (not replacing wiring harness, etc).  Agent told me that Allstate and Allstate NJ are different in the way they handle claims and I shouldn&amp;#039;t worry if that happens to me.
