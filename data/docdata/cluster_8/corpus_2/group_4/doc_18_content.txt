It seems to me that what goes around ....comes around.     Banks and Financial Institutions have, for so long, sold and mis-sold products to meet their ever increasing sales targets with a complete lack of regard or respect for their customers.     Hence the reason the FSA has had to regulate to get the banks to &amp;amp;quot;treat their customers fairly&amp;amp;quot;.     The worm has turned Mr Barclays!     People are now a lot more informed and with the help of sites such as this can fight back on injustice and mis-selling.
