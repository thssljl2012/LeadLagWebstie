If your two insurance quotes are vastly different, ensure that the coverage is similar if not identical because there should never be a HUGE difference in cost of a policy.                        once when i compared quotes on insurance i brought the competitors best offer to my former insurance broker. he did put out a 20% cheaper tarif with the same specifics OUT OF THE SAME INSURANCE COMPANY with the only difference being the ontract regularly being set-up online and not with the clerk at the insurance office - he did it anyways.   So getting back to the insurance you originally wanted with the quote of that other cheaper competitor and ask for their least best price cant hurt
