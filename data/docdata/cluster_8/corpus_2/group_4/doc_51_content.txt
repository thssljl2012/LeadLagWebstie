You sir are an idiot. AIG holds billions of dollars of business insurance to prevent failure in case of a recession. Do your self a favor and read a book. If AIG fails thousands of other companies to collapse even though they may very well survive the crunch. Try to get your information from someone besides the crazy conspiracy nuts on digg. The media and the government are not trying to enslave you, there just short sighted.   I agree that some companies must just collapse. GM and Ford are on there way, and unlike banks, they don&amp;#039;t insure other companies.
