This is nothing more than subverting an established contract to bust the union.  Pilots going to work at GoJet have the exact same effect as those crossing a picket line.                      In the recent past, it seems that people are too loose with using the term &amp;amp;quot;scab&amp;amp;quot;. It is being watered down. Should prospective GJ new-hire think about these things? Absolutely. Personally, I would discourage anyone from applying simply for a principled statement. However, they&amp;#039;re still not scabs nor should they be treated as such......especially the pilots already on the property.    It seems that Hulas wants the strife and to treat GJ pilots as scabs is playing into his game.
