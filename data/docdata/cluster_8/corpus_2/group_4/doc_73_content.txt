Unless you choose to view statements for any of your accounts electronically and as a result, not to recieve paper statements or to recieve them less frequently, we will sed you statements for each account at least every 3 months, or if you have not used your account for at least 2 years, at least annually.    Different for Flexible Saver and Regular saver but i cba to go find that lol
