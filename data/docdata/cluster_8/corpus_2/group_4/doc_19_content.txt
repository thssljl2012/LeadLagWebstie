You can increase manning into an FDA or you can excess out of an FDA but you cant excess and put new people in.                      This is exactly why they place the &amp;amp;quot;1&amp;amp;quot; in every position.  By placing it in an FDA, an excess already exists.  Therefore excessing into the FDA does not &amp;amp;quot;cause&amp;amp;quot; the excess.  It already existed... Then, IAW the CBA, the &amp;amp;quot;number of pilots to be excessed from that crew position may be increased accordingly&amp;amp;quot;.         This is what they did in 08-03.  All that language does is protect FDA based pilots from a secondary excess where no excess previously existed.  By building in an excess, with the &amp;amp;quot;1&amp;amp;quot;, they have found a loophole in the language that gives them a pseudo bump n&amp;#039; flush...       At least this is my understanding from the last excess attempt ....
