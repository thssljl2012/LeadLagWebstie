Thanks... Yeah i am currently seeking further help with this.     im wanting to set up another rental property in the early year.    Servicing issue is probably the reason which im currently working on now.  Waiting on the rental increases coming in to action in January.    This will have a big effect on the Serviceability on the loans so we will see.
