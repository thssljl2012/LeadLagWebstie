Also, the accusation of &amp;amp;quot;the Mac brigade&amp;amp;quot; is also unfounded - it&amp;#039;s not as though I decreed &amp;amp;quot;WINDO$E SUX LOL.&amp;amp;quot;     I simply happen to prefer the design of the Apple laptop range, and the ease of use of OS X. That said, however, my desktop is a Dell Optiplex and my other laptop is a Lenovo Thinkpad - so if anything, I&amp;#039;d probably be classed as the XP Pro brigade.                      OOhh put your handbag away Mrs, your messing my hair     I was only    pulling your plonker Mr Barclays Manager, please do not take offence, I just enjoy paking the tiss out of MAC users, old IT dept joke that goes back some time, please accept my apologies if I came across rude.
