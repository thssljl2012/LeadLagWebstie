 Doesn&amp;#039;t surprise me a bit about Circuit City or AIG. I used to work for Circuit City and they did me and my aunt that worked there for many years wrong. So nice to see what comes around goes around. When I was getting the tib I looked at AIG for insurance they are ridiculous they wanted something like $800 a month for full coverage. If I had that money I wouldn&amp;#039;t need full coverage. DHL is terrible around here when I ordered my laptop it started off in Nashville, Tn it went to Atlanta, to Orlando, to Ohio, to Roanoke Va, then reached here. What I am getting at is all those companies either have terrible services, over priced, or bad employee relations so this is not far fetched for this to happen. Sorry to hear about all the jobs I know how it feels to be screwed out of a job. Looks like the unemployment rate is going to go up some more.
