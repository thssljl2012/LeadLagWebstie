 Market responds to socialist policies -Drops below 8,000        If you had to pick any one person to run any of the industries in America ... would it be Barney Frank?        Every time he opens his mouth the market drops a couple of hundred points.        NPR interview with Barney Frank:     http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97187470         Excerpt:    Q:    So this could be $50 billion, $75 billion, $100 billion?    A:    Well, [insurance company] AIG, which I don&amp;#039;t think anyone would think was as important to the American economy as the auto industry ... got $40 billion just now to make it up over $100 billion. To some extent, let&amp;#039;s not have a white-collar/blue-collar bias in our public policy. You know, those who say, hey, go bankrupt so you can cut back on what the unions have won  the unions have already made some concessions. But, you know, we&amp;#039;ve had enough anti-union activity, and enough increase in income inequality in this country. I don&amp;#039;t want to set a precedent that bankruptcy now is a way in which you undo what gains unions have been able to hold on to.        My comment:    ....He turns it into something it never was til he decided to make it a class war.     How about no bailout for anybody Barney?    Set a precedent?    Failing companies go bankrupt ... they restructure and they go on. The airline industry just went through a slew of them and the country survived. Go figure.        This propping up of disaster to allow it to happen again is socialist garbage.    Last edited by Xplorer. on Wed Nov 19, 2008 7:13 pm; edited 1 time in total
