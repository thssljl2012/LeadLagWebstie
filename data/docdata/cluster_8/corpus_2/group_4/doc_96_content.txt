The thing is most of the consulting in US is 3 months contract to permenant hire work.So that time you definitely need to change your employer.                          I am guessing you are in IT work. If yes then the nature of the work is suck that you will find more contrats than perm.      Agree with your change in employer bit - hence many people just go (IT sector) visa consultancy who hold their LCA&amp;#039;s.      But this is not the norm just exception. I have 3 friends (Barclays,Wachovia and other smaller firm) who got permanent jobs. Also one/two of the people on this very forum got into KPMG...So it is entirely upto sector and skills I am thinking. In IT it&amp;#039;s more project work. So for you to change employers, I am told takes anything from 1-6 months from within US or fly out and get it dowe straight away.      Again that&amp;#039;s what I have heard - could be wrong. One of my friends moved from Wach to another firm - he went to Canada I think to get the visa done in 2 days.....
