I have a UK SkypeIn phone line which routes to my mobile phone if I&amp;#039;m not logged in, so my family can call me without it costing them an arm and a leg. The problem is that apparently this number used to belong to someone else as I&amp;#039;m getting sodding Sales Calls from Barclays Bank at Stupid o&amp;#039; clock in the morning. Frankly, it&amp;#039;s beginning to wear a bit thin.      I know I can stop other Skype users from calling me, and I&amp;#039;m fairly sure I can block phone numbers from calling me. The problem is that I don&amp;#039;t know how. Does anyone have any idea how I can do this?                 Not sure if this will work, but going under Tools &amp;amp;gt; Options &amp;amp;gt; Privacy Tab &amp;amp;gt; Blocked Users, it has a drop down that explains you can block by Skype Name or Phone Number.                 That worked, thankfully. The Blocked Users screen is a little vague and doesn&amp;#039;t make it very clear that you can enter a phone number as well, nor does it say you need to enter the + in the phone number.      Anyway, I just gave Barclays the finger. Fuck &amp;#039;em. When I go back to visit my Mum in December I&amp;#039;m going to open an account with a different bank and move all my UK money there.
