They just burned almost that much last quarter between the three of them, and I really don&amp;#039;t see things getting much better in 2009. By the time it&amp;#039;s all said and done the price tag is going to be in the $50-75 bil range, because they&amp;#039;re going to need funding probably into the first quarter of 2010, after the other effects of the CBA kick in (especially the VEBA).       GM probably isn&amp;#039;t up against reorganization, from what I&amp;#039;ve read and listened to. They&amp;#039;re likely facing liquidation.
