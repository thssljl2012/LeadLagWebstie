How does this make ASA somehow above other regionals?         Are any of the companies you just listed Alter-Ego companies that were developed to get around a company&amp;#039;s CBA with a work group?     Riddle me that.     What does me working at ASA have to do with my statement about scumbag operations ran by scumbag management?       And I&amp;#039;m sorry. . .did I some how place my company on some podium of &amp;quot;above other regionals?&amp;quot;     I must have missed that.
