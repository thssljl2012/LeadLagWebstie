You can only get over the counter money from Barclays when you dont have a card.. You&amp;#039;ll need ID        I hate Barclays, they messed my account up so many times when i got it 6 month ago that i had no choice but to go back to HSBC, which im glad of, i had trouble with them but after Barclays HSBC are like gold dust!      Im pretty sure that if you pay 6.50 a month like i do you get card protection?
