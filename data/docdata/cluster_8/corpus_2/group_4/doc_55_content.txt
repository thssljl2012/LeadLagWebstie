We on on WTR with very small mortgage, savings and a good wage and we only got $2 k limit. We have asked to increase is as hubby needs it for travelling on buisness and 2K doesn&amp;#039;t go far when paying for hotels etc in US$ or UK.     It would be nice to know if people think our small 2K limit is very low.   and if so could they recommend a non Westpac bank to try and move our banking to!                          How long have you had the card? Have you asked Westpac about a credit limit increase?   Other banks you can approach include ANZ, Bank of New Zealand, ASB or National Bank.      It sounds low but maybe that is just because you are new to the country.  I am sure that after about 6 months you will be able to get a higher limit
