        QUOTE (Kev3188 &amp;amp;#064; Nov 12 2008, 10&amp;amp;#58;53 AM)       That&amp;#039;s fine by me; I&amp;#039;ll take the better Scope, benefits, vacation, etc.  With regard to the pay rates, I&amp;#039;m still ahead of my DL counterparts when factoring &amp;amp;quot;total compensation&amp;amp;quot; in.   Say what you want about our CBA, but there&amp;#039;s nothing in it precluding Anderson from extending that raise to everyone. If DL doesn&amp;#039;t want to do it, that&amp;#039;s okay; they just need to be upfront about it, instead of lying to the masses.     No lies Kev, it is what it is. You cant have your cake and eat it to.
