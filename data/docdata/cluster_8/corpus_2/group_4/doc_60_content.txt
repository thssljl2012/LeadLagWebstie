 Google &amp;amp;quot;Credit Issues Blog&amp;amp;quot;. Below lists their blog comments on the first case where they have had a debt totally written off.....     &amp;amp;quot;Credit Issues claim further success    Credit Issues are delighted to announce the success of a new case, resulting in the full write off of the clients debt.     The clients original loan was with Barclays, the debt being later sold to the recovery company Intrum Justitia.      At the time of application the total debt outstanding was 2961.87. The case entered processing at Credit Issues on the 1st October 2008, with first communication to Intrum sent on the same day. A response dated 16th October stated that Intrum were unable to provide the information requested as required by the Consumer Credit Act. Credit Issues lawyers therefore proceeded to obtain a full balance write off for the client.  Further update with client comment will follow.     This is excellent news and testament to the hard work and operational structure that exists only at Credit Issues.&amp;amp;quot;
