Billion-dollar hedge fund stars face grilling         Published: November 11 2008 20:18          Hedge fund managers who earned more than $1bn last year, including  George Soros and Philip Falcone, are being summoned to Capitol Hill on  Thursday to testify under oath about the potential risks their firms  pose to the broader economy.    The hearing before the House  oversight committee, headed by Democrat Henry Waxman, marks one of the  few instances in which the largely unregulated hedge fund industry will  be subject to a barrage of questions by lawmakers.    Politicians are now seeking answers from the hedge fund managers,  who appeared to have prospered as the financial crisis took its toll on  the global economy.     Until now, in recent hearings devoted to   AIG   and   Lehman  , legislators have only heard from executives who oversaw corporate failures.      Mr Soros, an important donor to Democratic causes, and Mr  Falcone will appear alongside John Paulson of Paulson &amp;amp;amp; Co, James  Simons of Renaissance Technologies and Kenneth Griffin of Citadel  Investment Group.     The committee said the managers had  co-operated with a long list of requests for documents, including  e-mails detailing the level of risk associated with each hedge fund,  the value of their positions in mortgage-backed securities, the  likelihood of the funds collapse and the compensation and tax  treatment of pay received by top managers.     The committee said,  however, that it had not yet made a decision on whether it would  release all the data it had been given publicly.    People familiar  with the matter say the five hedge fund managers were chosen because  they were the top earners, according to a calculation from Alpha  Magazine, which every year publishes a list of the most highly  compensated managers.     Hedge funds have been blamed for short selling the stocks of troubled financial firms and thus deepening their woes.     But their champions point out they are being unfairly penalised, as they are seen to represent the excesses of the market.    Congressional  hearings are, in part, political theatre, where an executive or  official is put under oath and then hammered with questions by  indignant legislators attempting to shame them into making a dramatic  statement or accepting responsibility for some real or alleged  wrongdoing.      But in some cases, hearings can bear real results.     A  spokesman for Barney Frank, the Democratic chairman of the House  financial services committee  which has chief oversight of the  financial industry  said his team used information gleaned from  Mr Waxmans hearings to decide whether regulation should become  more stringent and uncovered major gaps in existing  regulations.    Revelations  by Mr Waxman that insurer AIG had spent $400,000 at a lavish retreat  for insurance agents a week after the governments $85bn bail-out  forced the company to initiate a review of spending and cut its  lobbying expenditures.     AIG also terminated a $1m a month  contract with a London-based executive, Joseph Cassano, who was accused  by members of Congress of having a hand in the insurance  companys failure a day before the contract came to light on  Capitol Hill.    Mr Waxman will himself be under special scrutiny on Thursday.     The  liberal Democrat challenged his colleague, John Dingell of Michigan,  for the chairmanship of the House energy committee, a move that riled  the Democratic ranks and created an uncomfortable fissure just one day  after the Democratic presidential and congressional victories in last  weeks election.        http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/93e6b78e-b028-11dd-a795-0000779fd18c.html
