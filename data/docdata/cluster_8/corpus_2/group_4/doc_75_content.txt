Read this next bit:        Taken from this:  http://www.amicustheunion.org/Default.aspx?page=7312     So, as you can see, the average wage is only 16,500 and that&amp;#039;s at the high end of the market.    I will admit that this does not apply to me, but I am not going to apologize: I work 50 hours and over a week, I work hard for my money.                      That is shocking!    And Barclays Manager, you yourself don&amp;#039;t even make 30k    With such bad salaries, what makes a person decide to work in a bank?
