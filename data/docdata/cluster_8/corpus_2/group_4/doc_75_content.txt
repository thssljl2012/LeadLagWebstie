true, I&amp;#039;m not sure of the timeline..  But the only thing the boss cares about is if it cost em money$$$   so they&amp;#039;ll get on point.      Hey, as far as the ballot goes, i kinda agree..  But, the problem is the co brings in anti-union lawyers to say your&amp;#039;e gonna lose your job, or your wages aren&amp;#039;t guaranteed with a CBA....  ABSOLUTE CRAP!!!! un-true your wages can&amp;#039;t be reduced..      Of course there are people who hide behind the union,  but on the other hand their are people who suck-up to the boss also..  so, it&amp;#039;s a double-sided coin.   Personally, i think if you do your job &amp;amp;amp; if you get in trouble, take your lumps and go by what&amp;#039;s in your CBA you&amp;#039;ll be fine..  In my CBA, write-ups for accidents,or property damage you can rec 1, and the 2nd you could get a 3day susp, &amp;amp;amp; 3rd in6mos usually get&amp;#039;s a termination letter..  And every 6mos the letter&amp;#039;s get tossed out..    I do my job to the letter, and was shop steward for 6 years have only had 1 letter probably 5 years ago..
