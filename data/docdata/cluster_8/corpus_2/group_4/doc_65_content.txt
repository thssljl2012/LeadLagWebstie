 I have been an SF agent for about 10 yrs.   Adding new contract agents will have no affect on me.  Most are failing anyhow.      The only reason, I speak up is that it I feel its unethical, what the company has told these guys.  It is bad for them, and the turnover is bad for our clients.      A flood of desperate new Tica&amp;#039;s selling any and everything possible is not good.  When you are over 50k in debt and need to sell to keep your job, dont tell me you are always selling based on the best needs of your client.      That environment, breeds unethical behavior.
