****UPDATE****    Turns out the kid did have insurance. There was still some question for a while. Nationwide knew that they had a policy, they just weren&amp;#039;t sure that this car was on it.    The adjuster called me yesterday, he has seen the bike and is writing a check.    Whoohooo! Looking forward to riding again soon.
