 I did exactly this when I first arrived. Just walked into a car yard and drove off 2 hours later in a car    The dealer will arrange a WOF (MOT) for you, usually for 6 months.    Registration may be a bit of a problem without a permenant address. I was lucky because I was able to use my partner&amp;#039;s daughter&amp;#039;s address till we rented our first house. The dealer will probably be able to help you, I suspect they get this senario quite often.    6 months Reg and WOF is usually included in the price of a used car    As has already be said, insurance is not compulsory in NZ, but strongly reccomended.  I get mine through Westpac bank, who didn&amp;#039;t charge any extra because I only had a UK Licence. I&amp;#039;ve heard that AA are very helpful too.    Costs?  My Mitsubishi Dingo, 1.5 litre Auto, mini MPV, 2000, 60,000k freshly imported from Japan cost me $8000. You can get a good idea of car prices at  www.autotrader.co.nz     Fully comp insurance, 2 named drivers costs me $26 a month    Unleaded petrol is currently $1.63 a litre as of 6/11/08    Hope this helps
