They have told you that the problem lies in the initiation and subsequent trading of &amp;amp;quot;sub-prime&amp;amp;quot; mortgages.. That is simply not the case. They have claimed that two million &amp;amp;quot;bad&amp;amp;quot; mortgages caused the financial crisis and they got $700 Billion taxpayer dollars so that they could begin to &amp;amp;quot;rescue&amp;amp;quot; you. Think for a minute, iamwhatiseem, the average US home sold for $203,000 in August. Two million such homes would be worth only $406 Billion. The treasury secretary could have bought every one of those homes and simply GIVEN them to the defaulting mortgagees, and had $294 Billion left over.       But we are told that $700 Billion, plus $2.3 TRILLION from the British government, plus $6 TRILLION from the EU, plus $2 TRILLION from the Japanese government  WILL NOT BE ENOUGH!  Do you understand? The $11 TRILLION already allocated will not be enough to cover $406 Billion in &amp;amp;quot;bad&amp;amp;quot; mortgages!      Obviously, someone thinks that you&amp;#039;re very gullible.      Okay, so you want someone to answer your question. The problem did BEGIN with mortgages, but we have to include ALL mortgages, not just home mortgages, and not just those which are &amp;amp;quot;sub-prime.&amp;amp;quot; Mortgages have long been &amp;amp;quot;bundled&amp;amp;quot; and traded among financial institutions. Buyers of these mortgages could then borrow against them, or sell them, and sometimes they did both. That means that many of the loans they had taken out were essentially unsecured, although there was paper (of sorts) to back them up. You simply can&amp;#039;t do both.      Unsecured loans make lenders nervous, so they created another class of &amp;amp;quot;derivatives,&amp;amp;quot; something called &amp;amp;quot;credit-default swaps,&amp;amp;quot; or CDS. These were supposed to function like an insurance policy for the unsecured  mortgage pakage loans. Now, if you understand insurance, you know that each policy has two kinds of value--the face value, or what the total payoff on the policy would be, and the cash value, the amount the policy is really worth. If you own a life insurance policy, you will be able to borrow money against it, but only up to the cash value.      But finanncial institutions (brokers, banks, insurance companies, et al) began to trade these credit-default swaps at face value, thereby creating a whole new class of unsecured loans. According to John Cassidy and James Surowiecki, writing in  The New Yorker  (9/29/2008), the total face value of credit-default swaps which our financial institutions have traded, sold, and borrowed against is a staggering $62 TRILLION. That&amp;#039;s   MORE THAN THE VALUE OF ALL THE REAL ESTATE IN THE UNITED STATES  --residential, commercial, industrial, and farmland, whether mortgaged or unmortgaged.       Okay, now you know what they&amp;#039;ve been hiding from you. They&amp;#039;re not tryimng to cover $406 Billion in &amp;amp;quot;bad&amp;amp;quot; mortgages, they&amp;#039;re trying to cover $62 TRILLION in worthless paper.      Some of the borrowing has been circular--Broker &amp;amp;quot;A&amp;amp;quot; borrowed from Bank &amp;amp;quot;B&amp;amp;quot; which borrowed from Insurance Company &amp;amp;quot;C&amp;amp;quot; which borrowed from Broker &amp;amp;quot;A&amp;amp;quot; and so on. In such a case, all that we&amp;#039;re really out is the amount of the commissions paid on the transactions, which cannot be more than a few TRILLION. But some of the borrowing has taken place outside such loops--for example from the banks and government of China. We&amp;#039;re going to have to figure out a way to pay that outside borrowing back, or we&amp;#039;re going to have write a REAL mortgage on our entire country.      Now, that brings me to the part that you may not like to hear. During the past eight years, the Bush Administration has not only used China as the lender of last resort, but also as the lender of greatest convenience. Nearly everyone knows that our most recent &amp;amp;quot;tax rebate&amp;amp;quot; didn&amp;#039;t come out of US tax receipts--President Bush borrowed the $150 Billion from China. When time to make an accounting finally comes, the Chinese are not going differentiate between private and public borrowing--they are going to want ALL their money. President Bush has made China our greatest creditor, and John McCain would, if elected president, continue the same misguided dependence upon Chinese largesse rather than actually addressing the underlying causes of our perpetual borrowing. So what I&amp;#039;m telling you is that I cannot vote for John McCain, because I am unwilling to sell my grandchildren and great-grandchildren into Chinese slavery.                      It&amp;#039;s as simple as watching where the money goes. The first and only company we&amp;#039;ve bailed out so far (to the best of my knowledge) is AIG. A company that has an Insurance division and a financial division under the same roof. Before the repealment of the Glass Steagall act of 1933 this was against the law. Thanks to the commodities modernization act of 2000 which enabled credit swaps we are brought to where we are today. If you want to stop it, bring back Glass Steagall and repeal the CMA of 2000, it&amp;#039;s that simple. The sad part of it is no one will go to jail over this shit because it was all made legal. I say let&amp;#039;s figure out who made the most in commissions here and let them pay instead of us... yea, fat chance of that happening.
