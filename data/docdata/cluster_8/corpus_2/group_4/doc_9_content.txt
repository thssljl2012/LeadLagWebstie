I always though purpose of imposing a credit card limit was so that if the customer went to make a purchase over the limit, the transaction would not be allowed.  But now I see that the transaction is actually allowed, and that the bank charges a $30 fee for the privilege!  (This is the case at CBA anyway)  No wonder people get into strife with their credit cards.  And what happens if your card is stolen and it is used for a $5000 transaction? (which I presumed was always another benefit of having a credit limit).     Could someone in the industry please explain this?  For example, do they just allow transactions to a certain percentage over the credit limit, thereby minimising the rsk of the stolen card scenario?  Do all banks have this policy?
