         Dave,  Schiff has made his clients hand over fist betting against the housing and credit bubbles. Eventhough his man, Rep. Ron Paul, is not going to get elected, he does say some controversial things which voters for Obama and McCain will not want to hear.  Schiff&amp;#039;s stand has never equivocated: he believes we should pay for our financial sins now and not off put them to future generations. He believes in cutting government spending and entitlements. He&amp;#039;s definitely against the bailout of Wall Street.  (See my post from minutes ago about how well the AIG bailout is working)  Like Mark Haines of CNBC, I don&amp;#039;t agree with everything Schiff says. But I respect him as he was way ahead of what Alan Greenspan&amp;#039;s Easy Credit would turn into. He, like Warren Buffet, was way ahead of the curve on CDSs, MSBs, and all the other alphabet soup paper products which pyramided debt around the globe. And as someone who has read one of Schiff&amp;#039;s books, I can tell you, the guy was dead on accurate about foreigners owning our butts by financing our consumption.  Schiff is called &amp;amp;quot;Dr. Doom&amp;amp;quot; by most pundits who oppose him. But he called this meltdown five years ago. Had you bought gold then with his clients, you&amp;#039;d be sitting pretty. I&amp;#039;m up 250% on my gold holdings since 2003 and I still will not sell them, no matter what. This is my &amp;amp;quot;hedge&amp;amp;quot;. Unlike big investment banks, I don&amp;#039;t &amp;amp;quot;hedge&amp;amp;quot; by buying worthless insurance from an AIG or other outfit who do not have the wherewithal to pay off my claims against them. Gold is in high demand at pawn shops, coin dealers, eBay, and elsewhere.   I can stand to see gold lose $200 overnight, and I can still liquidate tomorrow, if I wish, with a decent gain.  I thank Peter Schiff, Bonner and Wiggins, and other savvy economists for seeing through the b.s. Economics of Greenspan, Paulson, Wall Street, etc.   Although I&amp;#039;ve discovered this board only this year, this board has an excellent history also of having soothsaying posters posting charts, graphs and information which pointed to this coming collapse of our FIRE economy. Many of the links provided here five years ago were links with Schiff as the man behind a poster&amp;#039;s thinking.  Schiff is not a schill for McCain or Obama. He&amp;#039;s just saying that both candidates will have to pander to their voters who don&amp;#039;t want to face the hard choices which he and Ron Paul and others are calling for.  I, for one, am still against any bailout of the FIRE sector. Thus, I&amp;#039;m in Schiff&amp;#039;s camp. But I am not voting for Ron Paul. Any reader of PA knows who I&amp;#039;m voting for tomorrow. But I&amp;#039;ll not disregard anything Peter Schiff says just on the basis that he doesn&amp;#039;t support my man. Schiff has been so right on our Economy this Century he should always be listened to, even if you disagree with his politics.
