   Many are skeptical after it was reported that the three big auto makers asking for a $25 billion government bailout all traveled to Washington, D.C. on lavish corporate  jets . Ford Chief Alan Mulally, General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner and Chrysler boss Robert Nardelli all came under fire for their jet-set commute.  &amp;quot;Raise your hands if you are planning to sell your jet in place now and fly back commercial,&amp;quot; said one congressman. &amp;quot;Let the record show no hands went up.&amp;quot;  Congressman Gary Ackerman said, &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s almost like someone showing up at a soup kitchen in a high hat and tuxedo.&amp;quot; He along with many other Americans are wondering why the execs did not, at the very least, downgrade to first class.&amp;amp;nbsp;  The CEOs looked on sheepishly and did not respond. They say three million jobs are at risk if they don&amp;#039;t get the bailout.  GM Chief Rick Wagoner&amp;#039;s trip cost $20,000. A first class ticket on a regular commercial flight would have cost $837.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Crisis management expert Mike Paul says the jet-set commute, first revealed by ABC News, was a public relations disaster for the embattled auto industry. &amp;quot;If I had the three big auto makers as a client right now, the message I would be giving them is, &amp;#039;You&amp;#039;ve got to show every single action you have in public that you&amp;#039;re cutting back to.&amp;#039;&amp;quot;  The embarrassing revelation echoes the uproar over insurance giant AIG, whose&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; executives went on a lavish all expenses paid junket to one of the most luxurious resorts in America after receiving a multi-billion dollar bailout. Now Motor City&amp;#039;s top executives are being accused of a lavish indulgence as well.
