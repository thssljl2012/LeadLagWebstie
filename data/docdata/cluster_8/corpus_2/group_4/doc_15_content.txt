I think you will find that this &amp;amp;quot;AIG&amp;amp;quot; is not the same as that &amp;amp;quot;AIG&amp;amp;quot;.  Two completely separate companies according to press releases I saw at  the time of the &amp;amp;quot;bailout&amp;amp;quot;.  With only 3 letters in the name it&amp;#039;s no  wonder there are duplicates.
