Where you are getting this layoff idea, is beyond me.      Shoptalk is... well... not completely accurate. It is more of a &amp;amp;quot;bitching board&amp;amp;quot; than constructive ideas.      COLA raises, or anything in the CBA (Collective Bargaining Agreement) cannot just simply be &amp;amp;quot;re-negotiated&amp;amp;quot; at the snap of a finger if both sides agree, as you suggest. Talk with a PPA rep about it sometime, they&amp;#039;ll tell you.       The next PPA meeting is the first week of December. We should know more then.                      My response was the dispatchers post that &amp;amp;quot;they are already talking layoffs&amp;amp;quot; and they they will be the next step and are very likely.       The closest thing I have seen to that was when the PPA reps met with the County Commission and other unions yesterday to discuss ways to save money, where Rory Reid was quoted saying that all options are on the table. From what I understand, the county has no authority to lay anyone off at Metro, as we decide how the money they give us is allocated.

I know I would give up a raise or COLA if I could save someones job.                      This is exactly what I was trying to say. I know the PPA or PPACE would not re-negotiate under any normal circumstances, but hope they would if the alternative were layoffs.       I am not trying to start any trouble or arguements, but I dislike seeing the layoff rumor continue even after it has been addressed by the Sheriff and others many times.
