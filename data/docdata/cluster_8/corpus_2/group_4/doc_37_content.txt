Acutally, that&amp;#039;s AIG, no?    AGI: a failing mega-insurance company that my tax dollars are rescuing from disastrously poor business decisions.         As for Billy Connolly, yes, he made it here (at least for this anglophile) and I think he&amp;#039;s brilliant.  I can also understand 95% of what he is saying.  Of course, that could be from watching too much Monarch of the Glen.
