Yes, I got the same letter last month and I&amp;#039;m expecting another letter this month.    Although I called them up today just to hear some good news and they said they weren&amp;#039;t &amp;#039;obliged&amp;#039; to pass the discount on. I&amp;#039;ll be spitting blood if they don&amp;#039;t though!
