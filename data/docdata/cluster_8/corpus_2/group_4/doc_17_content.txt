 Congratulations on your new job.      I used to work for one of the Big 4 and they had it set up that on the day I joined the firm, a representative from HSBC came and visited and joined me up for a new bank account as this was who they banked with, so it meant I got my salary quicker.      It only took a couple of days to open.      Just so you know, you will not be able to open a bank account without your residency visa and this may take a while to process so you probably wont be able to open anything until you are here and have that visa in your possession.      With regards to off-shore.  Contact a Financial Advisor.        Barclays do have offices in Abu Dhabi - but for how much longer is anyones guess.  There is also HSBC, Citibank, Royal Bank of Scotland etc etc.
