I am so PISSED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    I cant find any cheaper insurance rate! I am so furious that my ins company(AIG) is calling this an at -fault collision! I didnt hit anybody! I simply pulled the corner of my bumper off when I pulled over one of those concrete parking blocks(ya know, the thing you are suppposed to pull over?!?!?)! The tabs that hold the bumpr on were broken so they had to replace the whole bumper! Now for the first time in over 18 years of driving I have an accident on my record! I am crying out of pure frustration!!!
