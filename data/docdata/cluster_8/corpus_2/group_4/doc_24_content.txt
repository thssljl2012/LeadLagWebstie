If one of my best friends who developed training programs for Arthur-Anderson hired me to help her with technical aspects of a project , and she did, does that mean I promote dishonest accounting practices? If one of my relatives is a Chicago cop, and he is, does that mean our family supports the rogue police action some Chicago cops are guilty of? If my youngest daughter attended a day care center in a church in Danville, IL that was bombed by a guy who attended a neighborhood party that I hosted, does that mean I support church bombings?     All of these examples are true and all of them represent what I would categorize as anti-American activities, but only an irrational person would try to suggset that I&amp;#039;m also anti-American because of my &amp;amp;quot;links&amp;amp;quot; to that activity.                      Only if any if those organizations had plotted the violent overthrow of the government and you were aware of it, would I question your judgement.
