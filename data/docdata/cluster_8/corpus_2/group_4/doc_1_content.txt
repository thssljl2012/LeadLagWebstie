  I had a discussion with my account manager at Barclays the other month concerning all sorts of things including what would happen to my mortgage if the bank went under and it was taken over by another bank. He was of the opinion that they could vary the terms (I&amp;#039;m currently on BBBR + 0.18% for the term). I argued that they couldn&amp;#039;t, they had to take my mortgage with the same terms. Ignoring what BBBR would be replaced with, he replied that they could, ultimately, quite simply, just ask for their money back!    Read your terms and conditions, there&amp;#039;s almost certainly an &amp;#039;on demand&amp;#039; clause in there somewhere! Not that they would (?), but we live in strange times!
