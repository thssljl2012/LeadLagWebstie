Comrade Obama?   By Patrick J. Buchanan    If Barack Obama is not a socialist, he does the best imitation of one I&amp;#039;ve ever seen.   Under his tax plan, the top 5 percent of wage-earners have their income tax rates raised from 35 percent to 40 percent, while the bottom 40 percent of all wage-earners, who pay no income tax, are sent federal checks.   If this is not the socialist redistribution of wealth, what is it?   A steeply graduated income tax has always been the preferred weapon of the left for bringing about socialist equality. Indeed, in the &amp;quot;Communist Manifesto&amp;quot; of 1848, Karl Marx was himself among the first to call for &amp;quot;a heavy progressive or graduated income tax.&amp;quot;   The Obama tax plan is pure Robin Hood class warfare: Use the tax power of the state to rob the successful and reward the faithful. Only in Sherwood Forest it was assumed the Sheriff of Nottingham and his crowd had garnered their wealth by other than honest labor.   &amp;quot;Spread the wealth,&amp;quot; Barack admonished Joe the Plumber.   &amp;quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need,&amp;quot; said old Karl in 1875. When Barbara West of WFTV in Orlando, Fla., put the Marx quote to Biden, however, Joe recoiled in spluttering disbelief.   West: &amp;quot;You may recognize this famous quote: &amp;#039;From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.&amp;#039; That&amp;#039;s from Karl Marx. How is Sen. Obama not being a Marxist if he intends to spread the wealth around?&amp;quot;   Biden: &amp;quot;Are you joking? Is this a joke?&amp;quot;   Biden&amp;#039;s better defense, however, might have be the &amp;quot;u quoque!&amp;quot; retort: &amp;quot;You, too!&amp;quot;
