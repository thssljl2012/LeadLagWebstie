AIG needed a bailout because the fraud they perpetrated would have taken out many of the financial institutions they had polluted with their mortgage backed securities scam. AIG basically traded away its name and reputation to vouch for these incredibly volatile investment vehicles. When regulators discovered just how dubious the sub-prime loans were and how little AIG had done to secure them with &amp;amp;quot;real&amp;amp;quot; insurance, the whole house of cards started to collapse. AIG executives should be in jail tonight.      Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac gave millions to Congress people and senators to grease the rails for their proposals, thereby lowering any attempts to regulate them or look at the with a critical eye. Freddie Mac&amp;#039;s CEO, F. D. Reines, inflated the financial success of his agency so that higher bonuses totaling in the millions of dollars would be released to him. He, too, should be in jail.       Congressman Barney Frank stood consistently firm (much like Marty McFly) in his conviction that everything was okay at Freddie and Fannie even though other pols were strongly suggesting they were not. Over and over again congressman Frank denied there was a problem and, in fact, implied that those who sought to push the issue were doing so for racist or elitist reasons. Barnie Frank should be in jail tonight. Alas, he&amp;#039;s been re-elected.      Car manufacturers signed stupidly expensive union deals while taking huge salaries and perks for themselves. They ran these auto makers into the ground. Jail may not be appropriate punishment. Unemployment certainly would.
