Can I just confirm, do you know people who have actually used this service successfully?                          Not personally, no, but I was pointed in their direction from other postsers here that claim to have had very good experiences with them.      When I contacted HiFX myself and spoke at length with them, I was very impressed by not only what they had to say but the way in which it was said. They weren&amp;#039;t pushy at all. Indeed, the guy I spoke with positively urged me to shop around with their competitors to make sure I was getting the best rate possible.      As an added bonus, they referred me to Westpac for setting up my Oz bank account. As a referral from HiFX, Westpac waved the monthly maintenance fee on my account and removed the minimum deposit requirement.      - CDM
