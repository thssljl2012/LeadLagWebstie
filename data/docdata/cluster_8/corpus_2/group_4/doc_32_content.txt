OK, so get this....      I&amp;#039;m standing at the gas station pump on Wednesday, minding my own business when I feel what felt like a 400 lb fat dude all of a sudden sitting in my car.  I turn around to see what the hell is going on, and I notice a guy in a Mazda 3 trying to park his car at the gas pump right next to me, wayyyy too close to my car for comfort.  So I stop pumping, go to the driver&amp;#039;s side and notice he actually hit my car! At this point i&amp;#039;m thinking in my head &amp;amp;quot;how the hell do you hit a parked car&amp;amp;quot; when he blirps out &amp;amp;quot;did I just do that!?&amp;amp;quot; I look at him, look at my car, and i&amp;#039;m like &amp;amp;quot;uhh yeah&amp;amp;quot;.  So I get all his insurance info, contact info, etc... took a chance not calling the cops since I was in a rush, and leave.      Well, luckily when I contacted his insurance company (Nationwide) I didn&amp;#039;t have any problems with them processing the claim since he did admit it was his fault to the insurance agent when she called him...      Which leads me to where I am now...I have the option of either going with one of their &amp;amp;quot;certified&amp;amp;quot; repair shops or choosing my own, with the lure that if I go with one of their certified shops, I get a warranty on the repair that&amp;#039;s backed by them.  Since I&amp;#039;m not really familar with this process, if I choose to look around for a shop, do I simply go to a shop and get an estimate? Or Does Nationwide adjusters do the estimating? And last but not least, can I get some other body repairs out of all of this (i.e. dent removals, etc...)      Thanks,
