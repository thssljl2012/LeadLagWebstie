My little three year old will be gifted $1k in Dec by the Gov to spend. Well daddy&amp;#039;s a party pooper and believes a cuddle and play in the park is more important than barbies or plastic toys.       So this $1k could go into her CBA dollarmite account and earn zilch, which with infation means turn into nothing when she is 18 or I could put the lot together and buy her some investments. But which one?       Please consider tax, dividends, capital gain, long term viability, security and liqudity to some extent.       What do you say to $1k in BHP Shares? as a starter?       I await your replies, Peter 14.7                      &amp;amp;quot;IMHO&amp;amp;quot;   If it was me i would put the whole 1-k into either CBA and use the drp to reinvest all the div&amp;#039;s,and try to add small amounts over time,or take the longterm outlook and buy PAG, large-scale farmers will become as big as the miners over time,but either way yours or your wifes name will have to go on the holding statement,it&amp;#039;s best to study up on the tax laws yourself   as everybody has different idea&amp;#039;s on how the ATO works..       This is not advice only what i would, and have done for my daughters but i made several mistakes in the set-up for them several years ago,not in the purchaes price most i bought for them are still up over 300%, and all the div&amp;#039;s have been reinvested back into the companies, the mistakes i made was who&amp;#039;s name went on the holding..good luck willair..
