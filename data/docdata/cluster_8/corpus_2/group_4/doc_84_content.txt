          I will never ever vote for a Socialist    I am glad to hear that you wili not be voting for a socialist like McCain who supports government nationalization of banks (twenty percent ownership of shares by the government now) and insurance (government now owns eighty percent of AIG).   McCain does not have a clue what to do economically.
