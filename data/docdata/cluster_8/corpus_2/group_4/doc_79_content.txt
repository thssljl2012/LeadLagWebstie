         I have always &amp;amp;quot;closed&amp;amp;quot; accounts with the non-bank savers. Keep an account with Barclays as it easier to xfer money into their ISA&amp;#039;s if you have one. Xfer between my NatWest and Barclays account is instantaneous.  Even though I have closed accounts with A&amp;amp;amp;L and BM, when I have applied for new accounts have never had to go through the id paths again and the accounts have just appeared on my on-line accounts. Not usre if this applies to all accounts. Mind you my Mum had the max in A&amp;amp;amp;L and recently tried to get an ISA with them the amount of id etc they required was amazing, so having an account does not mean you can skip the money laundering requirements for id.
