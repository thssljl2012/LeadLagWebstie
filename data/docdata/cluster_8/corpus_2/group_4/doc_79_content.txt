 Funny that, I&amp;#039;ve done the opposite LOL.       The quality of people working at your local branch can make a big difference IMO. The quality of service person to person is alot better at my local Lloyd&amp;#039;s than the HSBC.      Having an account in credit helps too          Whilst its a very busy branch, they&amp;#039;ve had a staff change around over the last two years and the people at the top running the place are now spot on. Quickly dealing and getting rid of the incompetents working beneath them that nearly made me leave (one fool posted company shares certificate out the safe via unsecured signed mail without my consent!!   ). People there now actually go out of their way to sort out any problem, they don&amp;#039;t fob you off (i.e to cancel my CC payment protection, it needed to be done via phone, so instead of fobbing me off, they take me into a room and do the phone call for me in my presence   ). This is a stark contrast to how they used to be, where they used to always cock up and fob you off.      Whilst Lloyd&amp;#039;s have improved vastly, HSBC have gone and done the opposite and gone down the pan. Whilst the branch has been tarted up with a load of fancy cubicles (of which makes it impossible to find anyone to serve you   ), nobody goes out of their way and they prefer to just fob you off.          This is all face to face stuff: Both use ****e call centres though, but at least the ones for Lloyd&amp;#039;s aren&amp;#039;t Indian (having said that, been a while since I had one at HSBC too - thank goodness).      Also had fairly good dealing with Nat-west, but only if you have Private accounts that allow you to see their &amp;amp;quot;relationship managers&amp;amp;quot;. Again this is at one branch, but another local branch is not as good.      I did use First Direct, but needed to do face to face dealings which made it awkward, thus the need to switch to HSBC - which didn&amp;#039;t help much, seeing the local branch is crap.      Barclays, don&amp;#039;t go there; especially if you want loans, and even more especially if its for business. And its not just me either, I know other people have been left out to dry because of them.
