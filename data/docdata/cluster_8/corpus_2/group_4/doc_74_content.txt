        Outrage of the Day: AIG (AIG) and Market Wizards (11/19/08)      Cramer directed his ire at two targets on Wednesday. First, given the billions of dollars taxpayers are devoting to bail out insurance giant AIG, Is it too much to ask where that money is going asked Cramer, who urged AIG to open its big book and show us the money.    Cramers next beef was with people who brag that they saw the crisis coming got out in time and have everything in cash. He pleaded with these financial wizards to have a bit of empathy for people who have lost everything; their savings, retirement money and college funds, and refrain from bragging at such a sensitive time. In short, he told these know-it-alls to cease from boasting and to shut the heck up!   Dont know what empathy is? Google it! vented Cramer.   http://seekingalpha.com/article/106931-cramer-s-mad-money-market-triage-11-19-08?source=email   Cheers!  Elan
