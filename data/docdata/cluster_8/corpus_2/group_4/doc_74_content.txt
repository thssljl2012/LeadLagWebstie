 I have a feeling you&amp;#039;ll feel differently about the current contract when we begin to lose serious market share (even worse than we currently are) because of the way new market agents are being treated.  Remember, &amp;amp;quot;your&amp;amp;quot; book was built by someone else - you are just collecting a check.     We are so demonstrative on this forum because it is the one place we can vent about what is going on.  No one wants to hear the reality of what is going on.  And, and, because we do love the company and the opportunity.  Any enterprise is doomed when it fails to look critically at itself.  We&amp;#039;ve based advancement not on leadership ability, but on production numbers.  When that happens, ego rules the day.     Being 4+ years in, I love it.  I&amp;#039;m going to make it.  And each and every day I know that I built this - it didn&amp;#039;t come gift wrapped.  And that, fastrack, my friend, is something you will never be able to say.
