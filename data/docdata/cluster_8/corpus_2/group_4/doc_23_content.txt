The problem is greed and the circumvention Of Basel II and insurance reserve rules. AIG issued policies (CDS) with no reserves and securitized loans were an attempt to create wealth on paper where there was no actual wealth to be created. Why are these rules created- to prevent what is now happening. A basic tenet of economics is that to maintain a superior life style one must be technologically superior. We are now trying to maintain the status quo by borrowing. The real danger is that eventually this borrwed money will be have to be paid back. If we are not profitable now what makes it certain that we will be profitable in the future? The next big question is will the rest of the world finance our debt? They may find there are better places to spend their surpluses. they may arrive at the conclusion that we have no intention to repay the debt that this is an interest only loan. The bottom line we have to live within our means. The GAO estimates that our contractionual obligations for Social Security, Pensions, and medical care for US retirees is 130 trillion dollars which means we will have to donate 10 years Of GDP to pay for it. Total 2007 GDP = 13.8 trillion. Peter
