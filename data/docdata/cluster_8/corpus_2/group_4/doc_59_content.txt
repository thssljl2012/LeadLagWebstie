Are they &amp;amp;quot;smart&amp;amp;quot; if they short the highly appreciating asset in anticipation of a rapid fall and they profit from that, and are they still smart if they short the appreciating asset but greater fools drive them into a loss (on which they choke) before they are able to profit from a later price fall?     In other words, are you (my wan) awarding the label &amp;amp;quot;stupid&amp;amp;quot; (and by implication &amp;amp;quot;not stupid&amp;amp;quot;) purely on the basis of realised P&amp;amp;amp;L?       Very reasonably question. Personally, except by proxy in defending UncaYimmy, I avoided the label &amp;amp;quot;stupid&amp;amp;quot;. My only reference to the term prior to that was to say, &amp;amp;quot;Stupidity is subjective&amp;amp;quot;. I didn&amp;#039;t object to UncaYimmy&amp;#039;s use of the term as it was used as a direct objection to DanishDynamite&amp;#039;s assertion of, &amp;amp;quot;I blame stupidity and greed&amp;amp;quot;. UncaYimmy&amp;#039;s use was then merely a logical device to show that the term belonged equally, if at all, across all spectrums of people, including the &amp;amp;quot;average Joe&amp;amp;quot;.     The speculators win, lose, or draw that was in it to try and time the short term market are not the relevant group under consideration here. BlackScholes isn&amp;#039;t designed to say anything about these tactics. Their successes and failures are independent of any long term viability of the stock. The relevant group that could arguably qualify for such a label is the institutional investors in it for the long term security BlackScholes was designed for. This includes some 401k management, some banks, lots of life insurance policies, loan default insurance, etc. AIG got into financial trouble because they never considered the possibility that one loan default could have any effect on the odds of another default. If we accept the &amp;amp;quot;stupid&amp;amp;quot; label wrt the mortgage crisis at face value then even the Nobel Prize committee qualifies. Neither I nor UncaYimmy  made in claims of the term being relevant in assigning blame. Me by avoiding the term, even the OP title says &amp;amp;quot;nobodies fault&amp;amp;quot;, and UncaYimmy by using it as a rhetorical device to show lack of relevance.
