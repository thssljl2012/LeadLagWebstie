 credit to borrowers - individuals and businesses.  Even AIG - is a major insurance company.  Look at all the houses that were burnt to the ground in California.  If the insurance company does not have funds, the homeowners are out of luck.    But, the way I understand it, the problem of Detroit is that they do have the products but no one is buying.  So giving them money to pay suppliers... for what, making more cars that no one is buying?  I think that giving a one time tax credit - say, $1,000 - to tax payers who is purchasing an American car would accomplish more.
