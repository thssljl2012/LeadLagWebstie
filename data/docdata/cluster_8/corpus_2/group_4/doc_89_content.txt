This helps to maintain confidence in Australias currency by making it more difficult for counterfeit notes to be passed or remain in circulation.       It is not possible to remove damaged notes from circulation immediately any damage becomes obvious  nor is it necessary when the damage is only minor. Minor damage does not prevent ongoing use of a note or affect its value. The RBA works with banks, other authorised deposit-taking institutions such as building societies and credit unions, and cash centre operators such as armoured car companies to remove damaged notes from circulation as soon as practicable.           How Damaged Notes are Assessed        A genuine note that has become worn or sustained minor damage in circulation can be exchanged for full face value. These notes are classified as unfit notes and may have small pieces missing or small holes (less than 20 per cent of the note missing in both cases), have been torn, have heat damage affecting less than 20 per cent of the note, have adhesive tape on them or have been stapled or defaced. These notes can continue to be offered and accepted in transactions because they are worth full face value. The RBA asks banks, other authorised deposit-taking institutions and cash centre operators, to remove unfit notes from circulation when they are returned to them by their customers.       When damage to a note is such that a piece of the note is missing, i.e. the note is incomplete, the RBA needs to take into account the possibility that both pieces may be presented for value separately. It is clearly not sustainable to exchange each of the pieces for full face value. If two people have two pieces of the same note, the RBAs policy is that the most equitable outcome is for each person to receive a share of the value equal to the proportion of the note they hold. The combined value paid should be the face value of the original note. Importantly, the presence or absence of specific features such as the serial number(s) is not a factor when determining value.       The RBA adopts the following policy for determining the value of damaged notes where pieces are missing:      - If less than 20 per cent is missing: The note is regarded as unfit and full face value is paid.    - If between 20 per cent and 80 per cent is missing: The note is regarded as incomplete and value is paid in proportion with the percentage remaining, e.g. half face value if half the note is present.   - If more than 80 per cent is missing: No value is paid.         Damaged Note Claims        Banks and other authorised deposit-taking institutions are authorised by the RBA to accept, assess and pay value for incomplete notes presented to them, and most do that. Assessed value is based on the surface area of the note remaining, rounded to the nearest dollar. The RBA provides grids to banks and other authorised deposit-taking institutions to assist them with calculation of value of incomplete notes. An Incomplete/Badly damaged/Contaminated Australian Note(s) Claim Form must be completed by the holder of incomplete notes when they are presented for assessment/payment. Because full face value is not paid on incomplete notes, care should be taken when accepting such notes. There is no obligation to accept an incomplete note when offered in payment/change.       http://www.rba.gov.au/CurrencyNotes/...tes/index.html                       Thanks for that      Would the missing part of mine be more or less than 20%? I have the damaged note in my hand now and I am comparing it to a full one and its hard to tell what % is missing... what do people think?      I might just take it into the bank in the city tomorrow- probably the Commonwealth or National etc.      Thanks     SEQ92
