But now I don&amp;#039;t seem to be able to transfer my money online or set up a standing order???? I think someone else mentioned this as well, how pointless is that so now I have to go to the branch on monday to sort!!!     Hope others are finally getting there as well.  Alison                      dont get to excited you have to go into branch queque up to see personnal banker, they fill in a &amp;amp;quot;fax instruction for cash isa top up &amp;amp;quot; form,which they fax off to isa admin dept in liverpool, where they take in my case 6 days to transfer the money finally into your isa!     so you will still be losing interest for another week yet.     good luck
