Ok back to the subject of Citibank cards.I really do not want to be limited to QFF for redemptions.Nothing else so far does anything for me on their awards catalogue.I have therefore emailed them saying I see no need to renew my card after 2009 unless they can come up with other rewards and have again suggested SPG and AA.My CBA card will do if velocity is the only redemption that means anything to me(though not that much).
