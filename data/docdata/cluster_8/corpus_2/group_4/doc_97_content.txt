 I agree Wreck, but how awful of you to rat out his parents.   I thought Succub&amp;#039;s response would have ended it there.   I&amp;#039;ve only personally seen one policy that restricts locations, and that&amp;#039;s for classic cars with antique plates and classic car insurance. If you have antique plates and classic car insurance which costs considerably less than full coverage, the insurance will only cover accidents that happen between where the car is stored, your home, and parade and car show locations. They are very strict about those restrictions too, so if you have an accident, you better have some way to explain that you&amp;#039;d been to one of these places. But that&amp;#039;s assuming that Dazdi is borrowing his parents classic or antique car which is very unlikely for an 18 year old.
