It just depends on why Bank of America said no. If they said no because of debt to ratio (how much your monthly payments are as compared to how much you make per month), then pretty much all banks are going to look at it the same way. First, find out exactly why they said and go from there. I know of one couple that bought a second home for their son who was going away for college. They formed an LLC (to protect their other assets), and then purchased the second home with a commercial real estate loan. Keep in mind, most banks will only allow 80-85% LTV (the amount of the loan allowed as compared to the total value of the home), and would prefer to do loans for homes that are at least $100,000 in value. Before you do any of this, make sure you consult a tax adviser and make sure that forming an LLC won&amp;#039;t adversely affect your personal taxes. A lot of times, you can just file a schedule C on your taxes for your sole manager LLC or a sole proprietorship, but again, I&amp;#039;m not a tax adviser. Good luck!
