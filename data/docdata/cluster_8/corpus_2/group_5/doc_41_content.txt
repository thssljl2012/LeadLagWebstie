          &amp;nbsp;  I&amp;#039;m copying the following from &amp;quot;Maintenance&amp;quot; part of gv51: &amp;quot;ECO Comment: I am not satisfied that you qualify for 10 points in this area.&amp;nbsp; You have failed to provide the specific documentation as stated in the PBS Tier One Guidance.&amp;nbsp; Your US bank account shows you have a balance below that required to qualify for points in this area.&amp;nbsp; Your Life Insurance Policy cannot be considered only the specific documentation as stated in the guidance.&amp;nbsp; I am not satisfied that you meet subparagraph (d) of Paragraph 245C of the Immigration Rules.&amp;quot;  The bank statements I had submitted was to document my salary in addition to an official letter from my employer.&amp;nbsp; For proving my cash funds, I had submitted an official letter from my non-US financial institution (in my home country) stating the amount of my &amp;quot;available for demand cash funds&amp;quot; which is not the book value of my life insurance policy but is the net payment after the company makes some deductions from the book value to cover some expenses when I&amp;#039;d get when I close my policy. The letter not only mentions the funds are available for demand cash funds but also states that the amount had never been under $6,000+ during the last 90 days.&amp;nbsp;  I&amp;#039;m afraid they haven&amp;#039;t understood how the policy works, it is not pension funds, it simply works as a bank deposit to which I make monthly payments and I can close down my policy whenever I want by getting my funds with interest back.  Any recommendations for me before I fax my Administrative Review Request Notice?&amp;nbsp; Do you think I may hope for a change in their decision?
