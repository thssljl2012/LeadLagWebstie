hey ppl.  i will be working in japan soon through a transfer from my company.  however, i will be paid in USD still through my US bank account.  what would be the best way to transfer the money.  i guess i could do it once a month to beat the transfer fees but i was wondering if anyone else here is going through the same thing.
