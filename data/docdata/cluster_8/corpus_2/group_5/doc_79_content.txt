friend's son going to,New York USA to study for a few years.   what Bank account is more convenient for him to withdraw and transfer    money to his child in the usa to pay fees etc.      Citibank.ca(nada) comes to mind.Do they have US dollar acct in Canada.does not say so on their website   HSBC used to have a good deal with their premier account but now they are charging 28$ per month service charge.   Others say Royal Bank.Any charges?      May be some snowbird/student will know?   thanks
