          We have a one year hietus in 2009 and then in 2010-2011 the ARM and Alt-A bubble kicks in with another trillion bucks.   2009 is the big year for defaults due to job losses.  Those are much worse than the reset problem.  Sub-prime, teaser loans, and other unaffordable loans got the foreclosure ball rolling, so people seem to fixate on those issues.  The reset at much higher rates because rates were still high last year.  5-year ARMs from 2003 and 2004 aren't going to reset to much higher because rates are ultra low now.  By the time 2010-2011 resets are happening, high inflation in the markets could have interest rates shooting back up again.  I think that most of the real damage to the housing market will have been done by the economy before then.  Because so much effort has been made to prop housing prices up on the way down, I expect that housing will move up very slowly after the eventual bottom is reached.  The GSEs are soaking up REO inventory now and I expect they will release that gradually after the banks have dug themselves out from under their own pile of REO.  Here's a quick article on how Fannie Mae has chosen to become a landlord instead of trying to sell some new REO:  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/15/business/15evict.html?_r=1...     Fannie Mae said Sunday that it would sign new leases with renters living in foreclosed properties owned by the company...  Many financial institutions  including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America  have policies to evict renters after foreclosure, company representatives said.   It does make good sense, as Fannie already has way to much REO.  Somehow I think the main policy driver, however, is to see less Fannie REO competing with Chase and B of A REO on the market.
