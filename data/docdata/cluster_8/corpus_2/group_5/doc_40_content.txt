The credit crisis has the big three tied up just as much as it has its customers not getting credit to buy the cars.       The government should loan the car companies the money at 5% and let americans know that each year the government would be making 1.7 billion in interest from the loan.      What a novel idea? The government would actually make money for a change and just waste our tax dollars on bridges to no where..       Hundreds of billions of dollars will be lost if we let the big three go bankrupt.       Millions more people will be out of work...      Bond holders of the big three will have lost everything.       Lend the big three the cash and move on.      I think the fed will do it or another dept of the government...      Congress couldn&amp;#039;t do anything constructive unless they get their years worth of kickbacks.. Its so obvious its not even funny.       How citibank got 300 billion....AIG got 150 billion...Bear Sterns got 30 billion..and meanwhile the congress is raping the big three executives ...      Its all a dog and pony show for the voters.       When the ***** hits the fan and these automakers don&amp;#039;t get the 5% bridge loan...      Lets see how many of the 61% of americans are smiling that they voiced their opinion to let these manufacturers fail...      Whose going to clean up the mess.       JMO
