The reason they want to kill the auto industry, particularly Ford, goes back to a book written by Henry Ford about their behavior in the 30&amp;#039;s. Do some research about books written by Ford and you will figure it out, unless you have become too dumbed down by our government and corporate media.     Bank of America CEO is Kenneth Lewis..he was born in Meridian, Mississippi.   Wachovia Robert K Steel is from North Carolina  Sun Trust James M Wells III also an American citizen  Wells Fargo Dick Kovacevich born in Washington State.  Where is the idea that most are dual citizens? Proof?
