 That POS interviewer wouldn&amp;#039;t let that guy get a word in. The GOP meme of blaming the Unions for the big 3 auto makers problems is really tired. Where are the Republicans when Citibank asked for the bailout did they ask them for a plan? Did they make Bear Stearns come before Congress to plead their case? No, this is a case of big time discrimination against blue collar workers of this country. If the big 3 go down that could mean 3 million jobs down the drain. Do they really think that our economy will survive that hit. This is all about Union hate and blue collar worker hate. This meme that Union workers make 70 dollars an hour and don&amp;#039;t do very much is such bullshit. The average Union auto worker makes 14 dollars an hour and works very hard for that wage. They could be doing other things and make much more but they dont. Unfortunately even a lot of Democrats are pushing this meme of &amp;quot;I need to see a plan before we give them one cent&amp;quot;, even Obama has said this. This is just hate on Unions stuff.
