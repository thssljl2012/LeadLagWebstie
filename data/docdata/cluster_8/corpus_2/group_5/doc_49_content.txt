 I am in the process of claiming charges of around 500 from Virgin CC/MBNA. I have sent all of the template letters and the only response I have had is a list of all my charges. I am at the stage where the next step is to take them to court.    Today I received a (poorly) hand written envelope containing a cheque for 78. On the cheque it says MBNA Bank of America and The Co-operative Bank. It is one of those official large cheques.  There is no letter with the cheque and no explanation of what this 78 is for... Anyone else had any experience of this? What should I do?
