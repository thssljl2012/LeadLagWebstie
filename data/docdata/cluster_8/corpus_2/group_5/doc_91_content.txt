Checking this against my live Bloomberg terminal showed the exchange rates are extremely competitive, Citi are not shaving any any on the bid/offer spread - the one off fee is all you pay.                      I&amp;#039;d like to know what site you use to exchange money as I&amp;#039;ve always found citibank to be on the expensive side. Even Lloyds TSB were a better bet from my past experiences.      Here&amp;#039;s the site I&amp;#039;m referring to:-     http://www.citibank.co.jp/JPGCB/NPA/...o?locale=en_JP       It clearly shows buy/sell spread.      I can&amp;#039;t believe citibank aren&amp;#039;t making a buck out of exchanging!       I still think forexing is the way to go.
