I have to wait for nine months of stable account transactions, before they'll consider an application. Pretty much the same from AMEX, last time I enquired about 'rolling over' my cards to a personal loan, or even with my mortgage.                      You have a mortgage with AMEX?      If not and it's with a bank have you considered refinancing the mortgage. Surely, you want to renovate the bathroom or put in solar power. Or even switch banks to &amp;quot;get a better deal&amp;quot; and renovate. It seems to me that provided the reason isn't to pay down the CC the banks will be more likely to loan.      Then, at some point in the future, if you decide that you can't do those things in these troubled economic times. Perhaps it might be wise to pay down some CC debt.       Of course, I have a fair bit of equity and the bank is always trying to refinance my mortgage. I've point this down to the refinanced mortgage being counted as new business (it is a new loan), which might help some branches if behind in their KPIs. That could count in your favour. My experience could be out of balance.
