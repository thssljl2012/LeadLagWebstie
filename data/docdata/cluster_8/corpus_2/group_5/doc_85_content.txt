          Today my mom emailed to say that ING (2.75% on savings) is now much higher than WaMu (2.0%). No longer having an ING account, I checked Emigrant, which is 3.0%! So... the bulk of our savings is getting transferred back to Emigrant (knowing full well that rates are likely to change this week with the coming rate cut).   Citibank, last time I looked, was at 3% (down from 3.75).  I have a couple of small-ish 6 month CDs at 4%.
