I can say this because my father was in business, a top executive, and even when adjusting for inflation/col, he did not make nearly the kind of money these guys today make.  It&amp;#039;s blows my mind... the greed!  Then you have defaults on obligations (on the personal level loans, credit cards, taxes owed, etc.) that get &amp;amp;quot;forgiven&amp;amp;quot; which just compounds the problem.  Never mind the kind of &amp;amp;quot;forgiveness&amp;amp;quot; that gets extended to larger entities like countries or even states.  I&amp;#039;m not making a value judgment here when saying this... (ie. third world economies) just stating the fact that the balance sheets don&amp;#039;t balance.  What is needed is  auditing  but then enforcement.          I do my best to be financially responsible (because I am fortunate in that regard and actually have something to manage), therefore having  the luxury  to focus beyond survival (unlike many for whom that is a daily struggle) and on what&amp;#039;s important which are the people in my life.     What do we take with us beyond the grave?  I won&amp;#039;t take what&amp;#039;s left of my money (if there is anything left LOL!) but I know I will take the wealth that comes from having been loved in this life.     Okay... I&amp;#039;ll stop being mushy.
