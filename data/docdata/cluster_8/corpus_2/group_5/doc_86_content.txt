FYI....the last major banking regulation change was signed into law in 1999 by Bill Clinton and approved in the Senate by Chuck Schumer, John Kerry, Chris Dodd and Joe Biden with a vote of 90-8. The change permitted commercial banks like Bank of America to enter into investment banking actions and, ironically, it is that diversification that has helped them to be strong enough to get through this crisis. The investment banks that have all faltered could have made the same mistakes prior to 1999, as the new rules did not apply to them. No new deregulation has occurred since. In fact, the Bush administration repeatedly called for more oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (17 times), only to be told none was needed by Democrats Dodd and Schumer, and this is where the questioning should begin in my opinion......I&amp;#039;m just saying.     If it was defeated 90 to 8, are you saying it was 90 democrats and 8 republicans. I was unaware that the dems had that much power in the house.
