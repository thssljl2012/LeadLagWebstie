I&amp;#039;m wondering if people are mis-reading that to mean &amp;quot;pay off in full.&amp;quot;    Paying off the balance under &amp;quot;current terms&amp;quot; means with the same monthly minimums and rate, until it&amp;#039;s paid in full, unless of course you miss a payment.  That&amp;#039;s a very reasonable opt-out clause.   i came here to post this correction.  --RC
