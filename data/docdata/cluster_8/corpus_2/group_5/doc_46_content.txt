I still have an RBS AAdvantage MasterCard.  This is slightly better, with 2 miles per  spent on aa.com (parallels the BA Amex on ba.com I think).

I&amp;#039;ve reached a few milestones where I have enough miles for a few F or J long haul trips and don&amp;#039;t know whether its worth putting the spend on AA Citi Visa, or go for the BA Amex 2-4-1 voucher instead.                       Given the excessive taxes when redeeming BA miles, they are probably only worth about half an AA mile anyway.  But they are good value if you buy WT+ fares and MFU to Club.
