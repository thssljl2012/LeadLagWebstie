Example, AIG Insurance company recently recieved billons from the government in bale out money immediately after recieving this money they paid their employees huge bonuses and took them on lavish vacations,(this just happened a few months ago), Vick will be required to pay for his own housing, as he is required to pay for the trip to VA for his state trial no disrepsect but as a taxpayer you should know that, I pay taxes too. Now you leap.
