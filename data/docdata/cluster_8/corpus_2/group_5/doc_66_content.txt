      My faith in Bank of America has been severely tested. I went thorough the on-line brokerage application process. It took several days, and a couple of phone calls to get the account created. I then faxed the info necessary to transfer funds from my BofA checking, and set up a margin account. Then today my account was back to an unapproved status. When I called, I learned that a credit report revealed that I did not have a phone land line (duh&amp;amp;#33;), which apparently disqualified me in the eyes of their computers.  I didn&amp;#039;t have the heart to persue this any further, and told them call me if they wanted any of my brokerage business. Most of my assets are with Fidelity, and I thought BofA might be a cheaper alternative. Now I am thinking that I should have been looking for a new bank, not a new brokerage.
