The moral hazard argument doesn't really work here.  In both cases, the bailouts help out people that weren't involved in creating the mess in the first place - not the owners of the companies.  The stocks of all these companies have been obliterated.  Financials are down a huge amount even since the TARP passed.  Sure, you could say it's better that Citibank is at $7 instead of $0 - but it's coming from $50, so the vast majority of the owner's value is already gone.  The people benefiting from the bailouts are everyone else not associated with the problem.
