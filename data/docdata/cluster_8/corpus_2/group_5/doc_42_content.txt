I have always found it better when the debt is sold. Firstly, the buyers have usually bought it for peanuts, so theoretically you &amp;quot;owe them less&amp;quot; (if you see what I mean). Secondly, the buyers are &amp;quot;detached&amp;quot; from the original debt, meaning that they don't hold a grudge because you've welched on your agreement with them, like some of the original creditors do. Thirdly, the buyers of the debt haven't bought the debt for a laugh... they've bought it to make a couple of bob, so they NEED you to co-operate and pay them monthly payments. What they don't need is you going bankrupt or they'll get nothing.  Likewise, they don't want to take out a CCJ against you as that is MORE money that they have to recoup just to get even ( with no guarantee that after the expense of the CCJ that you won't go bankrupt, making them more out of pocket). Personally, I always try to get the debt passed to a DCA or sold to a third party. I do this by being bl*ody awkward.
