       I don&amp;#039;t think many people understand the financial industry which is why they pay money to mathematicians and physicists to come up with weird securities that are so complex they might as well be Greek. They do this on purpose.  It&amp;#039;s easy to understand a car manufacturer but it&amp;#039;s nearly impossible for most people to understand the ins and outs of libor and CDOs and CDSs and tranches and other stuff.  That&amp;#039;s the big advantage the financial industry has on the auto industry: confusion.  People aren&amp;#039;t going to ask questions on C -Span if they are going to look stupid and confused. They just stay stupid and confused.  As do we all...sigh.  What exactly was the abyss anyway?  Who was going to get hurt if AIG couldn&amp;#039;t pay up on its insurance contracts?  People were all panicked about Lehman unwinding and it ended up being kind of a whimper.  Fraud? Extortion? Theft?  I think so.
