  quote:  Heh! I received my note just like SkySlashes.    Obviously not, since SkySlash said, and I here I quote:   The effective date for the new rate is Jan &amp;#039;09   Moreover, you can continue to pay off at the old rate until the balance is gone (though presumably with termination of the card once that has occurred).  So they gave both advance notice  and  a reasonable mechanism for opting out.    quote:  My note said that the rate was effective on the 3rd or my statement date, whichever was later. My statement date was Nov 30th. And I received the notice on DECEMBER FOURTH! Some advance notice there!    I&amp;#039;d be quite surprised if ex post facto notification were even legal.  It certainly isn&amp;#039;t here; they can&amp;#039;t amend the terms in their favour retrospectively.
