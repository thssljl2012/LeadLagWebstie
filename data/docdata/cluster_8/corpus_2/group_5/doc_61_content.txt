 pusk,  I anyone really knew the answer or exact formula to it, no market would be needed at all. This is the same reasoning as to why would GM stock rise or fall?... or AIG or Citibank..?&amp;amp;nbsp; It really just happens and when there is secretive purchasing of MBS, rates will ease down.&amp;amp;nbsp;For me, I will not touch GM with a 10 foot pole, but others will buy it.. hence the market and time will tell who is right/wrong.&amp;amp;nbsp; Strictly from a risk standpoint and performance of the loans under the MBS, rates should have a 1 as the&amp;amp;nbsp; first number (meaning double-digits), but they are simply being artificially kep alive to help in any way they can.&amp;amp;nbsp; It is like a horse race...&amp;amp;nbsp; The fastest horse (Secretariat for example) may not be the odds favorite if betters put all their money on &amp;quot;Gluey Lewie&amp;quot; The Elmer&amp;#039;s Glue Mascot or KNOX Gelatin posterhorse. So, if Hedge funds, HANK, BEN and Sheila decide to &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; lower rate MBS coupons in bulk... we head lower.. However, we have made it much tougher to borrow and here in FL.... values and home re-sales are slipping faster than the rates resemble an elephant on ice skates at MSG.&amp;amp;nbsp; Keep rockin&amp;#039;.
