                        I think those numbers posted in 36310 are the total remaining mortgage balances in play.  The analysis in post 36369 relate only to the &amp;quot;R&amp;quot; certificates.      As you will recall, the total amount of mortgages generated by Firstplus was sold to investors (bondholders) and US Bank pays these bondholders the entire paid principal and a portion of the paid interest, less servicing fees, every month, and issues a report of what they paid.        The I/O strips are the remainder portion of the interest payment that is due to FPFI, and therefore the Creditors Trust, of which Dave Obergfell is the Trustee.  Of these 'percent of a percent' monies, Dave pays all the creditors and returns a portion to FPFG - the parent of FPFI - who was never bankrupted, and who you and I own.      It is my understanding that the &amp;quot;R&amp;quot; certificates on the US Bank reports are indeed the Residual portion due the FPFX Creditors trust.  It has also been said that the &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; certificates, of which there are usually 2, also come back to FPFG somehow, but I'm totally unclear on the veracity of that or how it works.  Maybe others can comment there.      As I said, this is only a portion of the mortgage pools outstanding.  I think there are a half dozen more, but these are older and nearer to a zero balance, so I don't think they'll materially change the picture, but I will add those when I receive the reports.
