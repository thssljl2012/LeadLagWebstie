        &amp;nbsp;HW said: "Folks, the point to all this is quite simple,  we need a leave us the F..K alone law and a let us live law . A great example of how screwed up things are comes back to the big three. Conngress was pissed at private jets and the money the executives were making so the made them lose the jets and take a dollar a year while Bank of America spends 6 billion on a bank in China and AIG gets spa treatments. Hows about Congress, the Senate and that new President get a dollar a year until they straighten things out without hitting the taxpayers pocketbook, period!!!   They are sneaking these new laws in without public comment periods and this is BS.  "     &amp;nbsp;      Amen to that HW!!!     I say we take it&amp;nbsp;a step further&amp;nbsp;to say ..   We Require  a Leave Us the F**K&amp;nbsp; Alone Law and Let Us Live Law!      I&amp;nbsp;believe that the decisions&amp;nbsp;being made by the "powers&amp;nbsp;to be" are down right criminal in my book!&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;also believe&amp;nbsp;the time has come to start&amp;nbsp;demanding people be accountable for their actions and&amp;nbsp;decisions. I have no problem standing accountable for the decisions and actions I make&amp;nbsp;.. therefore why&amp;nbsp;should there be any difference? I'll tell you why .. it's these "powers to be" that are the criminals and who are responsible for the condition of our economy today. Look at this very plain example: Concerning the Auto Workers Union. Where does Senate&amp;nbsp;look first to make the "needed budget adjustments"? To the common worker while GM still has on the payroll this day an A**hole making what $16 trillion a year .. working out of an office that cost $16 million to build .. receiving bonus additions to help him&amp;nbsp;provide a&amp;nbsp;comfortable life for his family? What the heck&amp;nbsp;does he actually&amp;nbsp;do?&amp;nbsp;How many&amp;nbsp;vehicles has he actually touched or does&amp;nbsp;he even know the process of building a vehicle .. I doubt it! How do you justify that salary as safe&amp;nbsp;while looking at the worker on the line whose hands are responsible for turning out a safe and quality&amp;nbsp;product for our families to use for transportation? These high salaried greedy criminals are the very reason the auto industry is&amp;nbsp;in the condition it is in today IMO. Also, you got the the Senate pointing fingers at the Union saying they have waste&amp;nbsp;needing to cut areas such as health care benefits and&amp;nbsp;pension .. Wrong! Try cutting out the fat, greedy good for nothing but stinking fat a** who sucks up all the profits and cries $16 trillion is not enough to live on and provide for my family! Give me a break .. who are they? I tell who they are .. they are people who believe that their frootloops should be packaged in 14k gold and that the&amp;nbsp;VERY vehicle that their company builds is not safe enough for their&amp;nbsp;families to use for basic transportation! So what do they do .. they drive around&amp;nbsp;in vehicles that the common worker cannot&amp;nbsp;afford justifying by the attitude&amp;nbsp;"without my influence the workers would not&amp;nbsp;have a company to work for". Yeah .. that's the biggest crock and who ever believes that these type of big fat greedy people are anything other than a mouth piece who is paid to suck di*k needs to wake up!     Speaking about sneaking .. that's another issue where I see red!! Sneaking needs to stop this instant! We do not live in the freaking dark ages&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;it's high time that the people (us) stop allowing this crap to continue! As a body (citizens) do you not believe the day has come when we stand as one&amp;nbsp;to say Enough is Enough and demand that Sneaking,&amp;nbsp;Lies and Corrupt B.S. is no longer tolerated or acceptable? Criminals belong in jail and it's high time these protected crimals&amp;nbsp;learn where it is they actually belong!     Now back to the subject of this new law that NYC decided had to go in effect .. that's fine but let me ask this. Who supported this law and for what reasons? Truly? And what profits did their decision award them? Goes back to corrupt politicians signing off on crap that means little to them only to get a pat on the back in hopes that the next time thay have an issue they want passed they will get the support needed to pass. What about doing the right thing with the money at hand? Huh .. where in heck is that concept? Lost in space???? Seems to be .. cause it sure as hell has been a long time when any of the Senate did anything because it was&amp;nbsp;the right thing to&amp;nbsp;do!!     Awhhhe .. I feel better - lol!!! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;      &amp;nbsp;
