       A19: It pays to be a Washington / Wall Street insider. The CEOs of The Big 3 are not.  It&amp;#039;s funny to see how badly they&amp;#039;re getting treated. Here in the Midwest, some of the Big 3 CEOs are in some ways top dogs, almost like local celebrities. On the East Coast, as you can see, they&amp;#039;re nobodies. All these people from NY and DC are interconnected socially and monetarily so it is (clearly) much easier for the CEOs on Wall Street to put pressure on Congress. It took Citibank one long weekend to get $25 Billion and an additional taxpayer guarantee of $300 Billion in assets (no Senate hearings required).  The Big 3 car companies have made mistakes and they don&amp;#039;t deserve blank checks...Yet, some in Congress don&amp;#039;t realize that allowing GM and Chrysler to go into Chapter 11 in this fragile economic environment could be catastrophic for our nation&amp;#039;s economy -- talk about systemic risk (and everyone will get hurt too).
