And Osama Bin Laden&amp;#039;s followers never killed any one. It might be illegal, but it was done anyway[/quote]   for the most part, a large corporation like Citibank is not going to engage in obvious illegal activites.  They may toe the line at times, and act somewhat immorally, but they have a ton of lawyers that make sure the vast majority of their actions are legal (albiet questinably so)    quote:   And I can sue if I spill McDonald&amp;#039;s hot coffee in my lap. That doesn&amp;#039;t prove that the lawsuit is just or with merit. In fact, it&amp;#039;s obviously not just or right.        completly off topic, but if you do your research, you&amp;#039;ll find that lawsuit did have merit.
