April, are you sure it wasn&amp;#039;t just the exchange rate?  I have never heard of a credit card tacking on extra fees when used abroad.  I use my US cc in Canada every couple of months!  Or do you mean you used it for a cash advance?  That is always pricey, whether you are home or away.        Travelers checks aren&amp;#039;t really necessary and are probably hard to cash these days because they are mostly obsolete.  He can get cash from pretty much any bank machine.  The cheapest way that I know is to prepay your VISA then use the cc to take out cash (you can also use your normal US bank account but I think the fee is at least $3).  So maybe the gift can be prepaying his VISA?        I&amp;#039;ve lived in Brussels and my sister lived in Paris, so let me know if he has any questions! _________________ Cathie        DD Oct 99 and DS Nov 02
