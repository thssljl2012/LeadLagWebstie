They&amp;#039;re saying that because the market has irrationally undervalued their assets (which it has, after an extended period of overvaluation) they are now facing bankruptcy, which will have severe knock-on consequences. This doesn&amp;#039;t seem to be inaccurate, either.    I was generalizing.  I am not an accountant, but this is how I understand things.  Simply put, one declares bankruptcy because one doesn&amp;#039;t have the cash to pay the bills.  AP &amp;gt;  AR.  My point is that Citi has a huge AR due to their own lobbying efforts here in the US.  I would even go so far as to say the have an unscrupulous incoming cash flow.  That cash goes first to paying bills, then paying stockholders.  Unfortunately, most public companies have it ass backwards.  I couldn&amp;#039;t care less about the devaluation of assets.  (I&amp;#039;m assuming you mean their stock.)  A company&amp;#039;s value shouldn&amp;#039;t be based on the value of it&amp;#039;s stock (or at least solely).  It should be based upon it&amp;#039;s balance sheet - of which the stocks are one line item.  The problem as I see it is that companies like Citi only care about the share holders.  Yes, the shareholders do pump in cash to the company.  However, without customers, you don&amp;#039;t have a product to sell regardless of how much money the shareholders pump into you.    That is where service-driven companies have royally screwed up IMO.  Even driving away 25% of your customer base has a serious impact on your incoming cash flow.  Note:  This is not an argument, just a difference of opinion.   quote:  No.  Let&amp;#039;s be clear here: what happened to SkySlash was not shafting, and it was not spurious. Unsecured debt incurred through purchase of luxury items should be expensive.    That is your opinion.  Stating it as fact doesn&amp;#039;t make it thus.  You even used the word &amp;quot;should&amp;quot; which directly conveys opinion.  Now, with that out of the way...  Under the generally held understanding of several Citibank credit card holders who have posted in this thread, the sudden, unexpected rate increase was completely arbitrary.  Whether or not it was warranted from the POV that unsecured debt  should  be expensive is immaterial.  It happened to people to whom it has not happened in the past.  It was not announced, it was not anticipated, it was not expected.  It was not expected because people with a good credit history generally get treated favorably.  (And let&amp;#039;s be honest here, a rate increase is not favorable treatment.)  Case in point - I have a good history with Citi so they kept raising my credit limit - even when I asked them not to.  I had to call, escalate several levels, and get nasty before they finally got the clue and stopped doing it.  Turns out there is a catch phrase that only Citi uses and if you don&amp;#039;t use that catch phrase they won&amp;#039;t honor a request to put &amp;quot;a ceiling&amp;quot; on your credit limit.  Having an automatic credit limit increase could generally be perceived as favorable treatment.  That is the sort of treatment that SkySlash and others were expecting.  That is not what they have received.  It appears that several in this thread think that is a shafting.  Sorry, I said spurious (deceitful) when I meant aribitrary (random).  Although I admit deceitful is a good word too because who can possibly read and understand all of the card holder agreement?  It&amp;#039;s meant to be confusing so that it is easier to take advantage of the customer.  And yet they call it &amp;quot;service.&amp;quot;  If my Citi card wasn&amp;#039;t my oldest, I would close it.
