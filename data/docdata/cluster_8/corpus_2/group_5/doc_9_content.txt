                        Open my door? I'm not at all sure what you mean.      Yes, it will get worse, but: If one &amp;quot;qualifies&amp;quot; for a mortgage, one can get it. (I get solicited constantly by Citibank to run up my [low] balance.) I find it rather ironic that, crummy mortgage standards having become so deleterious that they more or less wrecked our economy, people now lament that they can't get mortgages on those same shoddy terms any more. In my opinion, that's a  good  thing. And credit is readily available for  reasonable  personal and agricultural loans (although I have no idea what it's like if, by &amp;quot;agriculture&amp;quot;, you're talking about Dole pineapple or United Fruit). That is not likely to change.      If anyone wishes to bet that less land will fall under cultivation next year and that agricultural commodities are truly the road to riches, he is welcome to dive in and buy agricultural futures contracts. Good luck!  Try pineapple futures!      (Voluntary Disclosure: Position-  No Position )
