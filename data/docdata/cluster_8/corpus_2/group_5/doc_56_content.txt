Unfortunately, yes. If a company becomes big enough that its failure would be catastrophic for the economy, the government is stuck with having to save it. That is also why the government has been saving companies in the financial sector, like AIG Insurance. The money involved is much more than for the auto sector, yet almost nobody seems to be complaining:      120 Billions $ for AIG bailout;         [Only registered and activated users can see links.    ]         After that, a 34 billion $ loan to the 3 auto companies is almost a no-brainer. Politicians are only posturing and playing hard-to-get as a show for their constituents. They know they have to cough the money.
