       Obama was helped BIG TIME by the UAW in all the upper Midwest states -- and Obama won every one of those key states...Obama owes the UAW and he owes them his best effort to provide the Big 3 with a bridge loan...and he needs to pressure the consumer finance firms to start to open up financing too...Obama will have to use some political capital but every week he allows the cloud to continue to hang over the automotive industry, the country&amp;#039;s economy will continue to deteriorate...I&amp;#039;ve got friends that do consulting throughout the extensive automotive supply chain and value chain...Jobs are being lost at an accelerating rate and it&amp;#039;s a vicious cycle -- this hits confidence too and it hits the markets...Look at how quickly Citibank got emergency intervention from the Treasury Secretary (and this was after Citi had already received $25 Billion no questions asked)...over one weekend Bush&amp;#039;s Treasury Secretary intervened and pumped another $25 Billion into Citi -- and then agreed to use our tax dollars to backstop hundreds of Billions in bad assets.  Obama needs to speak up and make it VERY clear that he wants to see action within days to help provide the automakers with a bridge firm.  IMO, if Obama&amp;#039;s new Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner was already in place then the automotive firms would already have assistance...But Obama has to deal with the current situation and Bush and Paulson seem to be against helping firms outside the financial services industry...It&amp;#039;s up to Obama to motivate Congress to get the job done -- and get it done quickly.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
