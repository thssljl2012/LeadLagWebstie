You are in hamilton and, what, an hour to the border?    Open a US bank account, put money in it, get a US credit card, shop online and have stuff delivered to a US mail facility just over the border.     Save up discretionary purchases so that a border run is only needed once every 2-3 months. Save more money on gas/milk/cheese and a few other things on the trip as well.
