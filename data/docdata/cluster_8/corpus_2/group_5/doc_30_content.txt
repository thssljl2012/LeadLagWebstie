Since then we contacted just by emails. One of my friend was interested in one of the bags of her collection too and decided to purchase it through me. So, I ended up purchasing 4 bbags from her and decided transfer all 4 times payment on the beginning of december.. I live overseas and it would be an international transactions. At first I wanted to do western union but the seller said that it would be a trouble for her because there is no western union around where she lives and she had to drive 1.5 hours to get into the closest western union and 1.5 hours back. Then I offered to pay through a friend's (who lives in US) paypal account or transfering from US bank to bank but she also refused. She insisted on bank wire transfer because she just want to deal it only with me not with other third party.This is what she said.       After I did the transfer, I asked the seller whether she receive the money. She always said she didn't receive anything,there are no oversea icoming on her account and kept saying that I transfered to the wrong account. I asked for the account information twice from her before the transfer and I am very sure that it was sent to the right account because all the information of the account (account #, name, address, etc) has to match in order for the transfer to be completed. Otherwise, the bank won't do the transfer. I also called and ask confirmed with the bank that the transfer was complete and the other party had received the fund. The funny thing is, after the transfer had been done, I tried to ask for her account info again to reconfirm it but she always refuse to give me the info and just kept saying I sent it to the wrong account.      To make it worse, I just found a similar bag on bonanzle. I asked the seller for more pictures and the pictures she sent me is the same pictures I get from this  eBay  seller!!!! I was wondering whether the seller on bonanzle was 'the friend' that was trying to sell the bag. But she wasn't. She is a tpf member and she sent these pictures to a total stranger who was interested in the bag.      So I'm sure that I've been scammed and I'm trying to get my money back. I've contacted the bank but they said they can't take back the money that has been transferred. I've also contacted the US police and they refer me to the 'secret service' that specializes in international fraud. I haven't file a report or anything, I just asked them for suggestions for what to do next and they said they will get back to me. I'm not sure what to do next. I am very shocked that a seller who has very good feedback on both  eBay  and bonanzle scammed me. Has anyone had this kind of experience before? What should I do next? Can you please share your experience? Any suggestions or inputs would be very appreciated. I have to sell my bbags to pay my friend if I can't get my money back. Please help!       Hope to hear from everyone soon.I'm still shocked right now.
