I know from my time in Melbourne a few years ago that they were very aggressive wrt both commercial property and residential investment.      I got a broker a few mths ago to send the average residential lvr figures for the banks mortgage books and IIRC they had the highest (CBA easily lowest), think it was mid 70s from memory, though stand to be corrected.      If things do get nasty as per the UK and the US you would think they (well I suppose Westpac) may have some real issues.        BTW what are the rumours DR?
