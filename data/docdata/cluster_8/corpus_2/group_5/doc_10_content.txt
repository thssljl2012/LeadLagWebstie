We need to know how we get this appliance repaired.                      As this is within the manufacturers guarantee your contract is with the supplier.  As they are in administration you should contact the administrators for guidance.  If an appliance is covered by the purchased extended warranty and fails after the first year then you need to contact RMS (Risk Management Services) on 0191 256 1001 as they deal with claims for AIG UK Limited who underwrite the insurance for MFI Financial Services Limited.     Hope this helps.
