    American people wrote:     I would rather support tax dollars for the auto companies than the banks,**** Bank of America got money from the bailout and won&amp;#039;t even pay the people holed up inside their place of work in Chicago,these people deserve their money, they worked for it.I think the government should hold them liable to,why give it to the banks if they don&amp;#039;t want to help disperse it into the economy.     This is exactly why the government should not be involved in any private industry, including banks. The Bank of America is doing EXACTLY what it should be doing, which is NOT making bad loans. Of course those employees deserve their pay, but their employer is the one that failed them, not the bank. If you loaned money to your brother to help him with his business, yet he still failed to pay his employees, would it be your responsibility to pay them?
