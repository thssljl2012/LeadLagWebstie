A lot of companies try to combine all of your policies for an additional discount. The thing they don&amp;#039;t tell you is that their &amp;quot;discount&amp;quot; may be the same, or more, than if you were to separately have the policies with different companies. Get quotes and do the math. Don&amp;#039;t trust their discount.   I do believe that Texas does not allow a discount to be applied to your Auto policy if you also have a homeowners with the same company. Thought I haven&amp;#039;t written a new PUP/HO policy in Texas for a couple of years. What is your net income and worth? Do you even need a PUP? That may be complete overkill unless you are rolling in cash.  FYI: before people come in and bash AIG for being douchebags; please know that their Insurance business (personal lines and casualty) are very strong, very profitable, and are required by law to keep on hand enough liquid assets to pay out every policy they administer in the event of a catastrophic loss. So if you do decide to go with them, you have to disregard the FUD and hype and realize that awful parent AIG company is very different from the insurance lines of business. I should know, I work for them.
