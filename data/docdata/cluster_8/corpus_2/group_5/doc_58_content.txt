See...that kind of thinking drives me crazy and was discussed in one of the other hundred threads on the auto bailout.         Who are these people that in your opinion &amp;quot;actually work for a living?&amp;quot;   My take of what you mean is that unless you're a blue collar factory worker or someone who swings a hammer, you don't really &amp;quot;work.&amp;quot;    I'm here to tell you that using your brain can be so much more stressful and tiring than a day of digging ditches.  At least you can go home and leave your factory or construction job there.         There are many days where I would gladly trade my white collar job for a job with physical labor... to reduce the stress and leave my job at work.
