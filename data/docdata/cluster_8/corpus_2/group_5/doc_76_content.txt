I think if the Republicans nominated a real conservative, the Republicans would have won. The financial crisis is what ultimately tossed the election to Obama, but if someone with enough guts to go after the CRA, Fannie, Freddie and Obamas involvement in a lawsuit against Citibank for not issuing enough sub-prime mortgages was the nominee, the 2008 election would have been a huge Republican win.
