 My understanding is that AIG's insurance side of their business is not in problem or has received any funding because of much tighter restrictions on what they can and can't do. It was their derivative side that turned out to be a poor decision. Just because it's part of AIG doesn't mean the insurance side of AIG was in trouble. AIG can't take insurance premiums or reserves because other parts of their business were in trouble.
