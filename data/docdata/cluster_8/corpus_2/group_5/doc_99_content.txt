 Toyota can be trusted? They've been linked to slave labor and are widely known to overwork their workers to death (without paying them overtime hours because the extra work is &amp;quot;optional&amp;quot; but really all the workers know they won't get promoted without it - sometimes they work more in unpaid overtime than they do paid time) then deny any benefits to their families...      There will be a GM, and even if there wasn't the bank owns the car, not GM. Worst case scenario you'd drop it off at your local Bank of America (or more likely they would negotiate a deal with some car brand to do all their lease return stuff for them, like GMAC and GM do now). You're obviously not understanding how your lease works.
