 We're a fascist country that sells death.  We create wars to sell our products in, create crisis to fuel hatred, perpetuate violence and sell to both sides, promote cheap labor slavery, have torture camps, have a huge propaganda network, have a corrupt crony government and rigged elections, have a for-profit health care industry, a criminal insurance racket (AIG for example), a paid-off corporate media, the list goes on and on and on.  "Investing" in America at this time is investing in crime.
