Who are these people that in your opinion &amp;quot;actually work for a living?&amp;quot;   My take of what you mean is that unless you're a blue collar factory worker or someone who swings a hammer, you don't really &amp;quot;work.&amp;quot;    I'm here to tell you that using your brain can be so much more stressful and tiring than a day of digging ditches.  At least you can go home and leave your factory or construction job there.         There are many days where I would gladly trade my white collar job for a job with physical labor... to reduce the stress and leave my job at work.                      I&amp;#8217;ve worked both white collar and blue collar jobs, but I don&amp;#8217;t know any blue collar workers that think they are overpaid or that anyone working any job should get a pay cut. I do, however know a bunch of white collar workers that think anyone that isn&amp;#8217;t white collar is over paid and should have a pay cut.    The fact that you think that white collar workers are the only ones using their brain is laughable. Maybe you should try working a blue collar job before you slam something you know nothing about. Or, maybe when your job goes away you will have no other choice.
