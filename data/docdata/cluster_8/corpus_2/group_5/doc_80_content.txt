Think of sub-prime loans as the longshot horse at the local racetrack. When the degenerate gambler explains to his wife why there's no food on the table he doesn't even consider his pathological gambling problem as a part of the problem. It was that damn #3 horse the the crooked jockey in cahoots with the others that ripped him off! Paulson, Bush and Congress looking at the extreme cases of poorly managed mortgage portfolios as what took down AIG, Citibank, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns and Merill Lynch is absolute nonsense.
