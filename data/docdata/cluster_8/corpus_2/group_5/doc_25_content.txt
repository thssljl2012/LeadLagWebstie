Want to know how else they do it?  SUNTIMES October 14, 2008  State Rep. John Fritchey says he goes to his brother-in-law's bank for the good deals.  Last year, the North Side Democrat put $275,000 from his campaign funds into CDs at Belmont Bank &amp;amp; Trust, owned by his wife's brother, James J. Banks.  Then, last December, the bank gave Fritchey and his wife, Karen, a one-year, adjustable-rate mortgage for $491,000 on their Lincoln Park home. The Fritcheys already had two other mortgages on their home -- a 30-year mortgage for $435,000 and a line of credit for $300,000, both from the Bank of America.  Bank of alderman's nephew lends millions to his wife Fritchey declined to say why he got a third mortgage on his home -- he now owes more than $1.2 million on the home he bought 11 years ago for $557,000. &amp;quot;My personal finances are, by definition, personal,&amp;quot; he said.  But Fritchey did say there was no connection between the mortgage he got and the campaign cash he deposited in the bank.  &amp;quot;I shopped around where to invest my campaign funds,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;And if I'm going to take on any personal obligation, I'm going to shop that around as well.&amp;quot;
