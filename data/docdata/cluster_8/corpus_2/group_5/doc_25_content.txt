GM can't turn a profit and why should the goverment give them a 5% loan to turn themselves around....???????????      BECAUSE EVERY OTHER COUNTRY&amp;quot;S GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS THEIR AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY THROUGH VARIOUS MEAN AND HAS FOR YEARS...EXCEPT FOR AMERICA....      Just one example....         Universal healthcare would have leveled the playing field easily. GM's largest single cost in building a vehicle was NOT steel but rather health care..      Does Toyota and Honda have that disadvantage?  NO!         Personally universal health care would mean nothing to me...as I pay for all my sons health care expenses out of pocket even with great private health insurance...and universal health care would be just as bad...      but for manufacturers competing in a global economy...American manufacturers need it as a component to compete..      I can assure you that  the Japanese public is supporting toyota and Honda..      Here in american we want to destroy  our &amp;quot;Big manufacturing base&amp;quot; and our congress publically  jumped on the band wagon to do so...      It made great sound bites.       To read  your babbling on how GM doesn't know how to run a business is nonsense.. Yes they just got their @ss kicked because.....      The credit crisis hit and crippled american industries first and now its traveling the globe to kick even the mighty toyota in the butt.       But lets not help out american manufacturering base..       Lets send our money to other countries to help them? WTF?       Lets build bridges to no where in alaska...      Lets spend billions on pork projects that have no true value..      So when someone asks why GM deserves the 5% bridge loan? The answer is.... because of all the money government spends on nonsense both here and abroad....      Americans.....our brothers and sisters don't need to be losing their jobs...or their homes because we can't lend GM money at 5% interest with a bridge loan..      What did AIG GET? WHAT DID CITIBANK GET? But GM SHOULDN&amp;quot;T GET IT...      I saw the canadians gave GM 3 billion without the @ss whipping..      Why is that?       One last question...who did HONDA CRY TO RECENTLY THAT THEY NEEDED HELP WITH CURRENCY VALUATIONS TO MAINTAIN SOME DEGREE OF PROFITABILITY?       Support your countryman for gods sake...and stop being so selfess. (SP)       The goverment blows so much cash on nonsense...SUPPORTING GM IS ONE THING THAT IS BENEFICIAL TO EVERY AMERICAN...(or at least 3 million of them)       Thats a hell of a lot of people for a 5% loan on 10 billion dollars..       The government when it gets repaid makes a profit no less...      Whats the fed fund rate to banks right now? and how does that compare to a 5% bridge loan to GM?
