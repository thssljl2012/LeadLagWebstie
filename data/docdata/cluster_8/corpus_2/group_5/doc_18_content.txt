The only way you can move up is to make your quarterly sales goals, have perfect customer loyalty scores month to month as well as a few other things they require. You could have your masters but if you don't do those things you are staying where you are at.             A degree probably doesn't mean as much in the retail banking industry as it would in banking management or investment banking.             US bank has a pretty strict policy on promoting from within for the upper management and investment areas.             I also respectfully disagree with this.  We just brought in 4-6 branch managers from Bank of America.  The hiring is dependent on the management. _________________ Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful - Warren Buffet        1999 Mustang GT - Wheels, Springs, Exhaust    2000 BMW 323i - Wheels, Carseats...
