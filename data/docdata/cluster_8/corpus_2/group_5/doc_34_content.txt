           Quoting  Burnsie28  ( Reply 5 ):  Sounds like from Nwaesc and NWBOS is that a lot of  NW  employee's are wanting to jump ship.          I don't think that many here are ready to jump per se, but if the right offer came along they might bite....      Not for nothing, but for me to even think about it would take at least the following:      *Payout of all accrued sick/vac/oji time (~1900 hours)      * Medical for at least 1 year -NOT at the COBRA rate      * The double severance that is accorded to us in our CBA currently-20 weeks in my case      * Some sort of flight benefits (this would be more for my wife than me LOL)      Yes, I know this is highly unrealistic, so no need for anyone to point that out....
