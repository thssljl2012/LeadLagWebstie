Too many losers got money they didn't deserve, and too many arseholes, gave money to losers who didn't deserve it.  In the end, the fear of armagedon pushed the fed to hand out my money.  If the people (arseholes &amp;amp; losers) continue the same practice that got us in this mess, then it means that more of my money will be needed.                      I think the fed rate being lowered and this move by Citibank shows that it is still dried up.  But we shall see.
