I concluded that the "receiving" bank can put any length they want on it ... I'm sure there is an ultimate limit, maybe it is 15 days.  Getting ripped like this really does wonders for my attitude.  Amazing too that back in the "old days" when everything was done w/ paper and USPS all it ever took - EVER - was 3 days.          thread start
