         Author: Xermes   Date: 13/12/2008 15:02:30   Number: 73500    'So belatedly the FSA finally &amp;quot;gets it&amp;quot;.  &amp;lt;fx&amp;gt; Sound of slamming stable doors!'   During the 1990s, I saw the pyramid scams.  A good example was the 'new Amway' which was the classic form of management fees on distributed goods: you can model it as a sponge - the surface sells and maintains the internal structure, a mathematical law of overheads increasing proportionately with sales so later members work for peanuts whilst hoping to recruit new mugs.  In the 2000s I trained for another scam, a subsidiary of a major US bank selling loan consolidation with 'investment products' to soak up the 'interest savings'.  That was more honourable though in that there was an upper limit on the proportion of income that went in commission.  Underlying these scams was the simple fact that the people who got in first were well-connected members of our establishment [the top person in the new Amway scam in my then County was a previous high sheriff].  The excuse was that these scams were legitimate business and that it was only the proles being ripped off - they weren't worthy of protection.   So, is the FSA now truly prepared to take on those who have for decades ripped us off financially?
