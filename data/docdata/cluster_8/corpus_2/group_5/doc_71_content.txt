Don't forget the entire industries that benefit from continuing prohibition. And I don't mean street corner black market participants looking for some quick cash. I mean those who rake in millions from money laundering (merger between Citibank and Banamex, anyone?), corruption on both sides of the border, anti-liberty politicians who need an easy way to distract people from the other stuff they get up to, prison guards and the greed-driven private prison industry... it's a very long list.
