         I had similar problems with Bank of america.  I told them to bring the rate down or I would transfer to another card.  They didn&amp;#039;t comply and I have closed all my accounts with them.  They are sneeky and always trying to trip me up with changing payment dates and odd online payment forms.  They suck.
