 If this is the case, you're sadly mistaken regarding what's taking place among the major banks. Most of the of the banks are insolvent, including the insurance company AIG. If you believe WE (taxpayers) are getting anything from the billions we have given them including the additional debt (death) load WE have taken on through the Fed and Treasury vehicles - you're in for a huge surprise. In essence, the banks have privatized the Fed and Treasury, instead of the other way around. I guess it's OK to privatize the earnings and socializing the losses, when it comes to the banks! I would be more misty eyed if the Fed/Treasury had taken non-voting ownership steaks in the banks and asked for the same concession that they're currently asking from the unions. (Although, I do find it ODD that you had senators negotiating wages and benefits with employees of a private firm.) If this is not sufficient evidence that they're trying to break the unions, I don't know what else would be a better indicator. And, to the young gentleman who inserted the link from the heritage foundation. Please, I beg of you never do that again. Everyone who is involved in politics is well aware that heritage, AEI, etc are right wing propaganda organizations. When you quote them, you lose immediate credibility from your fellow TCL members. The last thing you should do is deliberately lose an argument while you opponent is still putting on his shoes. Plus, most knowledgeable people will laugh at you and consider you an idiot. Not a great impression.      Quote, originally posted by  superleggera  &amp;raquo;     to end all this ridiculous off-topic arguments, and to reply to the OP:  the Real Reason Southern Republicans Oppose the bailout is that they don't want the country to spiral in to socialism where this phrase is the rule of law: "From each according to his ability [average taxpayers, i.e. us], to each according to his need [the big 3]" -Karl Marx I don't think it's fair for me to pay the price for decades of mismanagement and ridiculous union demands, this isn't the 1970's Yugoslavia. Done.    Modified by superleggera at 5:20 PM 12-14-2008
