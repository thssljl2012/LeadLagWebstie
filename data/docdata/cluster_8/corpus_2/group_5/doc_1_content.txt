    Hi Holmes   &amp;amp;nbsp;     Bank of America should have told the clowns to shove it. IT IS NOT THEIR PROBLEM AND NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO SUBSIDIZE BANKRUPT BUSINESSES.      &amp;amp;nbsp;   I agree, but it looks as if the bank will once again cower in fear and do &amp;quot;bad business&amp;quot;. Instead of standing firm on sound economic and business principles, it looks like the bank will once again take on more bad debt just so they can save face with the Liberal Media and Socialists. To me, they are worse than the squatters.
