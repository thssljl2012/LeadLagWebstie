AIG Defies U.S. Taxpayers by Promoting Sharia in America       December 4, 2008    by Jeffrey Imm    Anti-Jihad League of America     http://anti-jihad.org/blog/2008/12/a...-us-taxpayers/      http://www.unitedstatesaction.com/bl...icles/118.html        For the third month in a row, AIG is in the news regarding its promotion of Sharia-compliant finance (SCF) products, which promote the Islamic supremacist, segregationist ideology of Sharia. For a company struggling with its financial survival, it remains astounding that AIG would want to incite its American taxpayer owners by promoting products that are based on an Islamic supremacist political ideology. In October 2008, I wrote how the U.S. government gave an $85 billion loan to AIG, without demanding divestment of its business ventures reselling Sharia mutual trusts and its AIG Takaful division selling Sharia-based insurance. In November 2008, I wrote about how the U.S. government purchased $40 billion in AIG stock, making you as a taxpayer, an owner of a company promoting Sharia through such businesses.       For two months, I have warned that AIG&amp;#039;s Takaful division was planning to expand to offer such AIG-specific Sharia products here in the United States. Now AIG has announced that it has Sharia-based insurance products for the United States, and AIG is promoting them.       On December 1, 2008, AIG announced that it was &amp;amp;quot;introducing a Takaful Homeowners Policy, the first installment in Lexington Takaful Solutions, a series of Shari&amp;#039;ah-compliant (Takaful) product offerings in the U.S. The newly announced Takaful products are compliant with key Islamic finance tenets and based on the concept of mutual insurance.&amp;amp;quot; Note that AIG indicates that such Sharia insurance products are the &amp;amp;quot;first installment&amp;amp;quot; in a series of Sharia products. In the AIG press release, AIG Takaful&amp;#039;s Abdallah Kubursi expresses his pride in AIG&amp;#039;s ability to promote Sharia within the United States, stating &amp;amp;quot;This is truly a global effort on the part of AIG.&amp;amp;quot;       This is our company, using our taxpayer dollars, to promote Islamic supremacist Sharia-based products in our country. As we are $40 billion owners in AIG, this is our problem as Americans. What is our government and AIG going to do about this?       First, let&amp;#039;s remember what Sharia is and is not.       Sharia is a legal codification of the political ideology of Islamic supremacism. This Sharia legal codification is intended to enforce discriminatory and segregationist practices against women and non-Muslims and to suppress the liberties of those living in Islamic theocracies. As a legal codification of a supremacist ideology, Sharia is incompatible with democratic values and the inalienable human right that &amp;amp;quot;all men are created equal.&amp;amp;quot; In 2001, nearly two months before the 9/11 attacks, the European Court of Human Rights determined that Sharia law was incompatible with democracy and human rights. The President of the European Court of Human Rights stated that &amp;amp;quot;the Court found that sharia was incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy as set forth in the Convention... Principles such as pluralism in the political sphere or the constant evolution of public freedoms have no place in it. According to the Court, it was difficult to declare one&amp;#039;s respect for democracy and human rights while at the same time supporting a regime based on sharia...&amp;amp;quot;. Even British courts have ruled that Sharia is &amp;amp;quot;discriminatory.&amp;amp;quot;       In a nation such as the United States, based on the inalienable human rights of equality and liberty, why would American taxpayers seek to fund a business selling products that promote a discriminatory, segregationist, and supremacist ideology that is &amp;amp;quot;incompatible with democracy and human rights&amp;amp;quot;?       Sharia is not merely &amp;amp;quot;cultural beliefs,&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;religious beliefs,&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;social preference.&amp;amp;quot; In the AIG press release, AIG&amp;#039;s Abdallah Kubursi would have Americans believe that the goal of promoting such Sharia products is to expand &amp;amp;quot;social preference.&amp;amp;quot; But America has rejected those who would label supremacist values as &amp;amp;quot;social preference,&amp;amp;quot; just as they rejected white supremacists who once called for racial segregation and discrimination. America&amp;#039;s society, businesses, government, and law rejects supremacist ideologies. Just ask President-Elect Barack Obama.       This is the same Sharia ideology that has been used by the Islamic supremacist Taliban to murder those who they believe have committed moral crimes, the same Sharia ideology that was used to murder a 13 year old girl last month who was raped in Somalia, and the same Sharia ideology supported by the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and Islamic supremacists around the world. It is the same Sharia ideology whose zakat charities have been used to fund jihadist terrorist organizations. On September 18, 2008, Congressman Tom Tancredo&amp;#039;s office introduced &amp;amp;quot;Jihad Prevention Act&amp;amp;quot; (H.R. 6975). According to the press release from his office on this bill, &amp;amp;quot;the legislation would make the advocacy of Sharia law by radical Muslims already in the United States a deportable offense.&amp;amp;quot;
