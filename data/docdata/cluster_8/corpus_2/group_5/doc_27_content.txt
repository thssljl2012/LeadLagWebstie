I still lost a few guns and LOTS of expensive mags. I feel so violated... I even know who did it, I just dont know how to find them now. The people who lived above me just got kicked out while I was gone and there was no sign of forced entry into my place. The pop'ed the pins out of my back door hinges and just walked right in.           Stolen:   Rem 700 .243   old .22 semi-auto rifle that fed through the stock.   Ruger 10/22 T with the hammer forged barrel   Keltec PT3AT .380   Lowrance handheld HUNT GPS   10+ 19rnd DPMS .308 mags   15 Glock 17 mags   2  Glock 17 31 round mags   15 Glock 20 mags   Check book   Passport   spare Keys to my car - still worried about this.   more that I cant remember right now.      My landlord wouldnt let me bolt it to the floor, so they took the whole thing.      Just sick right now.                        @Coverage on most policies for passports to be replaced   @You can get your guns replaced   @They can take the deductible from the magazines   @You should be able to list the key itself in the claim. Not for re-keying though.       I'm a claims adjuster for a nationwide insurance company, and I can feel for you bro. A couple of things to consider. I'm assuming you have full replacement coverage on your policy.       Option 1: They will pay you on the front end at the used value, but you can recover the additional money after replacement. Lets say your Remington 700 is 10 years old. Here is an example:      Replacement: $800     Depreciation: $480       Actual Cash Value: $320      The $320 is paid up front. After you purchase the gun again you can recover the additional depreciation to reach te full replacement.       Option 2: Replacement Vendor: I'm a gun owner and I always offer this to an insured unless it's close to the deductible, and it wouldn't be feasable. Vendor sends gun to local FFL. You pick up the replacement. Insurance company pays vendor for replacement.       Option 2 is a good way to go. they may not have mentioned this. It may be because you might not have any supporting documentation for your loss. Just a guess. I would consider asking about option 2. They will send you the stuff.       &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;PAY ATTENTION&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;      Most homeowners insurance policies say something to the following in their conditions:        Complete a detailed list of personal items reported in claim. attach receipts, estimates,statements, manuals, invoices, etc. to justify the figures listed in inventory.       If anyone on here reads this the main thing to take is the key word &amp;quot;justify&amp;quot;. We are not payingf on your good word. That's done with. Time to get creative such as the following:      1. Picture of said Remington 700 from hunting trip with friends(e-mail can be attached to claim file)      2. Manual for purchase      3. Picture of inside of your safe(uyou know, the one we always put on here)      4. Receipt from gun shop (guys, get with it!!; don't be dumb. Keep some form of record for things).      5. Online banking statement(you know, the one sahowing the $556 purchase at Academy for the Glock 19 on 1/9/2007)         Call the adjuster tomorrow and ask about a vendor that can replace guns, firearm stuff, etc. If not then I can point you to a vendor that my company uses. We do it every day. Let me know.      Let me clarify, renters insurance is handled in the same manner as homeowners insurance.       Homeowners   Dwelling Coverage   Personal Property Coverage      Renters Policy   Personal Property Coverage
