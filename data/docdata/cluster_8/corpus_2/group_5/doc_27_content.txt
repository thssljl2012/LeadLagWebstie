 i'd just like to say that citibank's online security if ****ing assinine. they put all of this halfassed restrictions in place for user names and passwords and now, i can't remember what the **** they are since they had to be so obscure.     our IT dept at teradyne would do **** like this. people started writing passwords down and posting them on their monitors so they could remember them. maybe if the policies weren't ass backwards, then people wouldn't have to do that.    ****ing idiots.    /rant    thanks      mike
