The question came up because someone asked me what one was, simple as that. I&amp;#039;m considered a repository of basic trivia by a lot of people so I get questions all the time.                      Yeah ok fair enough, sorry about that I thought someone was telling you something and mentioned the term. But yeah fair enough as I say I don&amp;#039;t think there is such a thing as a non-correspondent bank apart from the fact that it is something which isn&amp;#039;t a correspondent bank in the sense that they don&amp;#039;t have an agreement with a foreign bank.      And what does ASB stand for?
