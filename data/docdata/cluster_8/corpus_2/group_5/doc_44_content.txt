         When I heard about this company that sprung up in Carlsbad called &amp;quot;youwalkaway.com&amp;quot;, I had a feeling this type of mentality was more prevalent than I thought.  This company will help you &amp;quot;walk away&amp;quot; from you mortgage and house (for a fee, I&amp;#039;m sure). I heard this was happening a lot up in the Inland Empire last year and this year, compounding what we&amp;#039;re dealing with today.  Many bought high with sketchy loan programs, used the houses as ATM&amp;#039;s, then when the loans adjusted to twice or more the payment, and thier equity gone, they just said Fk it and walked away. They probably got more out of the house than they put into it, and figured it as a wash.  I bought my first property, a small bach pad condo, back at the previous absolute housing peak in the early 90&amp;#039;s with very, very little down (fixed rate though). The market tanked soon after. I got married and needed a bigger place. I could&amp;#039;ve &amp;quot;walked away&amp;quot;, but I rented it out instead, just to help pay the mortgage. Luckily, I was only negative income by a couple $100 or so a month, and able to absorb the loss, and right off at tax time. I was now a reluctant landlord, but did OK.  Bought another house with 5% down not long after. Market still was dropping. I could&amp;#039;ve &amp;quot;walked away&amp;quot; from that deal too, because of no equity. But, we hung tough and the market eventually came back and then some.  Now we&amp;#039;re dealing with a popped bubble again. It will bottom out most likely next summer, then either a very slow rise, or possibly a vigorous rise if inflation kicks in.  But yes, todays new homeowners have a different entitlement mentality. Not sure how it&amp;#039;s evolved into this, but ethics (morals?) seem to have been lost along the way.      -------------------- did you surf today?
