   Judged:     2       LOL. &amp;amp;quot;Well-educated people&amp;amp;quot; should have read the fine print. I had a bank loan officer try and sucker me into one of these loans for my condo. Glad I said no thanks. If I don&amp;#039;t have enough money down, and if I don&amp;#039;t what the rate will be six months from now, I don&amp;#039;t want to play mystery with a mortgage. So many people wanted the house, and ignored the strings attached. These mortgage loans were written to jump up in rate, and at enormous amounts. Yet, banks were giving them away like candy. Bank of America was making mortgage loans to illegal immigrants last year. What was up with that? Now my tax dollars have to bail out these millionaires? I don&amp;#039;t think so.

Well educated people who purchased $1 million homes are being foreclosed on, as well. Everybody, thought their houses would never go down in value, now many of them are upside down with their mortgages. At least the poor people can plead ignorance.
