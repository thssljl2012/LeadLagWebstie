          I&amp;#039;m not sure, but I think the card companies will probably use the same rate for the whole of the day (the conversion is likely to happen as part of some sort of overnight batch process rather than in real time).   I&amp;#039;m not sure that&amp;#039;s the case, but an additional factor is that the actual conversion may not take place on the day of the transaction, or even the following day, but could be two or three days later, depending on the various factors involved (country, location, technology delays etc).  And your statement will show the transaction date, not the conversion date.  In times of volatility, you could win or lose a few extra quid due to currency changes in the meantime.
