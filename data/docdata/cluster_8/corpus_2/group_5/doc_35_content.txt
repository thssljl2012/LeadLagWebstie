     Borderlinx service sucks. Without knowing that there is a tie up between Borderlinx and Citibank, I registered an account with them. Despite me choosing Singapore as my country, I was registered as an EU customer and given a New York address, and charged a registration fee of USD$5.     I only realized I need a Citibank card when I wanted to ship items back. Only then did I contact their customer support and received HORRIBLE support. They pushed ALL the blame to me. I don't understand how the blame can be on me, since I already chose my country as Singapore, unless of course they didn't know Singapore is not an EU nation.     Such practices is akin to holding my goods hostage and forcing me to get a Citibank Card. Despite their cheap shipping charges, this is probably the last time I will use them. Consider VPOST as an alternative. They accept all major credit cards.
