   December 21, 2008   Norm, Screw the Lawyers. Hold a Press Conference.    By Brian Lambert      Since the mystery $75k kicked up in the final week of the campaign Coleman's official position is that this is a scurrilous, politically motivated attack ... never mind that the Franken campaign (nobody's idea of the slickest operation in town) expressed a convincing level of surprise when the news broke and no one as yet has even come up with a good theory about how Franken -- or even some super slick super spook at the DNC -- got a good old boy Texas Republican to sue FON Kazeminy and dribble out the story of him floating cash to Mrs. Norm.  Nevertheless, based on his assertion that the suit is politically motivated cash-strapped Coleman is tapping his campaign finances to hire every big name, heavy-billing attorney in the state. The poor guy's money problems are out of control. Starting with taking a sleeping room in a property Kazeminy owns in D.C., to dodging questions about Kazeminy buying his clothes, (   here is arguably the 2008's worst press conference moment   ), to a renovation job close to equal to the total value of his house (Norm is now underwater on the place, like many of his constituents) to stretching the letter of campaign finance law to pay a lot of top rank legal firepower, Norm has the look of one of those forlorn characters you see in late-night TV ads for spendaholics in credit counseling.  Suddenly I don't feel so bad fighting with CitiBank over the way the bastards try to game my Visa card rate.  I will not pretend I'm the first to offer Coleman this advice, but taking him at his word that the charges regarding wife Laurie and the Texan are preposterous and that absolutely everything Kazeminy and other friends have done for him has been above board and suitable for exposing to mothers and young children in full daylight, I would think Coleman could save himself one hell of a lot of money by calling Lyden and Kessler and Hauser and Brunswick and the rest of the usual suspects in and saying, "Ok, what do you want to know?"  I may be wrong, but the general sense I got from the "dorm room" in Kazeminy's D.C. basement story is that it did Coleman no harm at all. It might even have warmed the public to him a bit. I mean, "our guy in the most exclusive club on earth" isn't living the manor life, like, you know, John Kerry. He's bunking like a grad student. That's almost ... Joe the Plumber-like. By extension, Coleman summoning in the jackals and letting them discern his (and his wife's) innocence stands a good chance of winning him more public sympathy.  That assumes of course that he and the Mrs. are innocent and there's no fire beneath all this smoke. Obviously you don't want to invite the press bastards in -- or talk to them at all -- if you've got anything at all to hide.  But if Coleman is an honest man suffering baseless accusations, he could stop the clock on Earl Grey, Joe Friedberg and the others, and feed the press enough that they'd go off in search of "the real killers", as O.J. used to say. Talk about a win-win. No staggering legal costs and someone else goes and does the grunt work of figuring out who's spreading outrageous lies about you and your darling wife.  What bothers me though is that Coleman seems to be moving away from a simple public display of innocence. As Lyden (and others) will tell you, "Coleman has disappeared." Requests for interviews are either ignored or declined. Everything is now legalized, and when that happens the first victim is invariably the truth.  The second victim is the reputation of the guy who supposedly has nothing to hide.  The third victim is that guy's bank account.               There are none so blind as those who will not see
