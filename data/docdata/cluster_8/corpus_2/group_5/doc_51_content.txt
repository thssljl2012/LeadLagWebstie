here's one for liberals in denial         The Senate rejected the bailout 52-35 on a procedural vote  well short of the 60 required  after the talks fell apart. Just 10 Republicans joined 40 Democrats and two independents in backing it. Three Democrats sided with 31 Republicans in opposition. Reid also voted &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; for procedural reasons.          http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081212/...congress_autos             where were the REST of the democrats?      seems that a few democrats were missing from that vote. where was saint obomba? where was the senator from BANK OF AMERICA (joe biden)?  where was john kerry?    where was &amp;quot;too drunk to swim&amp;quot; ted kennedy?         seems that TEN REPUBLICANS voted NOT to invoke 'cloture' and 3 democrats voted TO invoke cloture.         it's more of the same old bipartisan hokey-doke where they PRETEND to give a fuck but somehow always manage to drop the ball         don't blame republicans. there were ten votes from the republicans. the democrats, if they had been a party worthy of the name, could have attained that 60 votes they needed - too bad some key democrats couldn't be bothered to even SHOW UP         i guess obomba was just &amp;quot;too busy&amp;quot; to help the union workers. it's easier to just blame &amp;quot;buscho&amp;quot;
