       OT  the COSTS of originate a mortgage is at least 3.6% at his bank   Horsecrap.  Plain and simple gouging of the consumer.  Your banker friend is talking the bank's position.  A flawed position at that!  Everyone has their greedy fingers in the pie.  The bloated structure of these banks and their &amp;quot;costs&amp;quot; are totally excessive.  This mark up is unnecessary and needs to be restructured.  Why do we need 4 fingers in the pie at 3/4 of percent each?  Greed.  Thats the only answer, imo.    Brokers, originators, marketing?  Horsecrap!  These are excuses, nothing more, nothing less.    With the 10 year bond yielding 2.1%, a bank would do very well taking my refi from 4.875% and locking in a 4% rate...if they don't feel they have to grease 3 unnecessary palms!  They don't need a broker, they don't need marketing, they don't even need an originator.  I pay on time and have never, ever missed a payment.  I make decent to excellent money, my credit score is near perfect, I have both money in the bank and investments...  and  the bank could generate immediate income/fees by doing this.  The bank makes money, I save money and all works out in the end.  Yeah, Right.  To see how totally upside down the banks are at the moment, take a look back at the US BANK link I submitted.  The 20 year rate is lower then the 10 or 15 year rate.    EDIT: I see they changed it from last night....regardless....the point is still the same.  Who's fooling who?  jmo  TO
