Someday you may learn paying 3.99 percent for a large business equipment loan is not such a terrible thing.  Well, until they fvck you over anyway.            Exactly. As soon as I opened this thread I knew there would be a smart ass who&amp;#039;d say something like that.     Anyways, BoA did exact same thing to me and I told them to f-off.      It&amp;#039;s the sign of times, everybody wants to stuff their mattresses with cash before poop hits the fan big time.  I blame Obama.           I had no idea we were talking business related credit here.  There&amp;#039;s a big difference between a personal credit card used to buy things with money you don&amp;#039;t have yet and using credit to run a business.            I&amp;#039;m self-employed, and I have  to run my business expenses through my personal credit card.  Rushing to judgement without knowing people&amp;#039;s personal situation   .... Just sayin&amp;#039;.
