   Understood, but poor PR and timing. Could have been toned down a bit.        These insurance salesmen worked for a completely different business unit, than the AIG insurance unit that was in trouble. Of course the media did not explain or even report this... but I digress.   The AIG unit in trouble is the one that provided insurance for risky, sub-prime mortgages.
