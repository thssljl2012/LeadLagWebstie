            Quote:   They tried that on us twice in the last few months. Talked them back down to the initial rate. I heard something about new regulations being placed on credit card co&amp;#039;s in Jan. So they&amp;#039;re trying to gouge their customers before the new regulations are in place. Keep a close eye on your statements, it&amp;#039;s not just B of A.      My citibank Amex is doing the same thing. Pay them off.
