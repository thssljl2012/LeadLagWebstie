   Yes Billg, the Feds arrested the Governor of Illinois the day after he says they will no longer do business with Bank of America.  As a lawyer, I can tell you the Feds do look to the timing, place and method of arrest to make a political statement.  This is a political statement.  It is a shot back by the Federal gov&amp;#039;t.  The Feds do not like states acting against Federal policy, which is, to bailout and protect Paulson and his ilk.
