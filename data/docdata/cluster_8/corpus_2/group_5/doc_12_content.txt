You can&amp;#039;t seriously be comparing that to what&amp;#039;s happening now.       This is a bailout of ALL THREE of the largest U.S. automakers, which is on the heels of the bailout of one of the largest financial companies in the world (Citigroup), which came on the heels of the bailout of the largest insurance company in the world (AIG), etc. etc.
