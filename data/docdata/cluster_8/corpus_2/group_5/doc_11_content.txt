That is a very sad an ongoing story here. They are still there by the way... Summary for anyone who hadn&amp;#039;t heard about this- Federal laws called &amp;quot;the warn act&amp;quot; were abused and these folks lost their jobs on a 3 day notice which is denying them their due vacation pay and other earned benefits. Not to mention, the warn act makes it illegal to not have given at least a 2 month notice for a layoff of over 50 people. They&amp;#039;re collecting donations. It&amp;#039;s a dismal time, considering they were cut off from Bank Of America (who just received billions in the bailout) as BAC wouldn&amp;#039;t provide the credit to the company........and the company was left without money.....and the families are suffering once again.
