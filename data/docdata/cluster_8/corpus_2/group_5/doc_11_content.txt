       remember AIG,  THE LAST DROP: AIG, you know the insurance company whos getting over $11 billion of our dollars in bailout money? Well, they announced theyre giving 130 of their executives cash awards of up to $3 million. These are cash awards, not bonuses. They say they are payments to guarantee that their top executives stay with the company. Oh, yeah, God forbid AIG should lose any of these business geniuses. Imagine what kind of shape theyd be in without these people. Again, these are cash awards, not bonuses. So we should send them to jail, not prison, see?  Jay Leno
