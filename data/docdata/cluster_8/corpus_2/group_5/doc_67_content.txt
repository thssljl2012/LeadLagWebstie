The new rate is not in effect for some period of time, as SkySlash indicated. I would be  extremely  surprised if they ever informed you of new rates only once those rates were in effect.    Heh!  I received my note just like SkySlashes.  My note said that the rate was effective on the 3rd or my statement date, whichever was later.  My statement date was Nov 30th.  And I received the notice on DECEMBER FOURTH!  Some advance notice there!  Not entirely the same but related - I have gone to refill prescriptions twice to find the rate increased.  I get a letter about a month later notifying me of the increase despite being required by law to be notified in advance in writing.    quote:  Cards with balances tend to be worse for your history than those without, even if you pay on time.    That seems like nonsense.  How else are you to build a payment history if you never have a balance?  Your wording is poor because I think you mean &amp;quot;carrying a balance&amp;quot; but you don&amp;#039;t say that.
