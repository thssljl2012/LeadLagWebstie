No, credit cards were made to make banks money. The line about convenience instead of cash is marketing.  The truth is, a credit card is a line of credit (called a loan in plain terms) and banks make money because they know people like to buy when they don&amp;#039;t have the money and will pay interest for the privilege. So, yes, credit cards are about borrowing money.
