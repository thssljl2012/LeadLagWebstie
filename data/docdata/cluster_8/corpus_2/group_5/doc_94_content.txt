         Somewhere in the fine print it will say that if there is ANY issue or change in your credit, then they can change your rate.  That means if you were late with your car payment, if you went to collections for a missing DVD rental, if you did ANYTHING that would have affected your credit in ANY part of your financial life, they have the &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; to blow up your sweet introductory rate.  It doesn&amp;#039;t have to be in your dealings with the originating institution at all, they can change your rate for anything you&amp;#039;ve done wrong at any point since getting the card.  Now can you think of a reason they might have changed your rate?   If you&amp;#039;ve honestly never been late for any payment for anything since getting the card, then you should fight it.   Otherwise, cut your losses and bag the credit card.     This is so amazingly common, I&amp;#039;m surprised I&amp;#039;m the first person to mention it.         -------------------- Composite surfboard co-op:    www.compsand.com
