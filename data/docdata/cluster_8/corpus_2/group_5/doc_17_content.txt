  how much did the &amp;quot;successful units&amp;quot; kick into to &amp;quot;save the company&amp;quot; before the taxpayers had to foot the bill? I read legally they can&amp;#039;t. The life insurance company can&amp;#039;t legally give the mortgage insurance company money. I believe I recall AIG trying to get the ok forrom this but New York said no.
