In 2002 I got a business line of credit with a decent bank (not BofA) and used about 30K for business expenses. Two years later the note was transfered to MBNA.  MBNA changes the terms, however my first loan docs had no provisions for new lenders  to change the terms. In June BofA notified me they were bumping my rate to 26.99.  I called and said they didnt have the right since my orriginal note did not contain any provision for modification of terms.  Anyway, the notice said it was because of information obtained from Equifax.  I pulled my info from Equifax and the only thing I saw that had changed was that I had paid off a Capital One credit card.   So is this a new policy for BofA? They look to see if customers are starting to pay down debt then get scared they may loose the indebtedness of the customer and thus double the rate to help to trap them?  Does any past employee have any information on this?  I am filing suit and am gathering as much info as possible. (BTW, FICO score was over 700)  I had also recently paid in another $7000 to reduce my principle. Does this course of action typically trigger a rate hike?  Customer service refuses to reduce the rate to the amount in my original agreement. Here is another little note. Bank of America cannot find any copies of my original agreement, signed application or other documents for the loan that they took over. I have already paid over $47,000 into this stupid note and still owe over $20,000. I never chose to do business with BofA, and never will. Thoughts?
