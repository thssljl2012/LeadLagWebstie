Yes because the 15th is Monday           DISCLAIMER: before we have 15 pages to this on why would you get paid on Friday and not Monday since Monday is the 15th, and blah blah blah... USAA pays different than other banks/credit unions. USAA will get paid on Friday, Navy Federal will be Saturday, VYSTAR credit union (here in Jax) will pay Friday after 6pm, Bank of America will pay whenever they pay, ect.       Ok,
