The only way you can move up is to make your quarterly sales goals, have perfect customer loyalty scores month to month as well as a few other things they require. You could have your masters but if you don't do those things you are staying where you are at.             A degree probably doesn't mean as much in the retail banking industry as it would in banking management or investment banking. _________________
