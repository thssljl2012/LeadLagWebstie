  These insurance salesmen worked for a completely different business unit, than the AIG insurance unit that was in trouble. Of course the media did not explain or even report this... but I digress.  how much did the &amp;quot;successful units&amp;quot; kick into to &amp;quot;save the company&amp;quot; before the taxpayers had to foot the bill?  if your rich sister lives with you, do you ask her to help out with the mortgage before you ask for a bailout from foreclosure or does she get to skate?
