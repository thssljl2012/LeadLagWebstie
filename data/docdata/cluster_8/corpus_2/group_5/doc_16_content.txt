I had a card through WaMu and another one that was so old I can't remember the name...  I'll think for a bit...The second one only had like 500 limit on it though... dang now that's going to drive me nuts... Maybe Bank of America.....       Neither one had told us until after.  We got one notice in Dec that they had cancelled it in Nov.
