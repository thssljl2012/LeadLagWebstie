The only way you can move up is to make your quarterly sales goals, have perfect customer loyalty scores month to month as well as a few other things they require. You could have your masters but if you don't do those things you are staying where you are at.             Wow I was thinking about applying for a Branch manager position out of college until the Financial jobs are stable again. Commerce Bank says it just requires a bachelors degree and prior work experience in retail or customer service or banking. _________________ 2006 CBR 600rr orange/black tribal     2004 Lexus IS300       [img]
