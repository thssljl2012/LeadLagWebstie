Surely they shouldn&amp;#039;t have to use their own money for such humanitarian projects. Prince Alaweed&amp;#039;s Citibank investment was just bailed out for $306 billion! the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia thanks the US taxpayers....no, really they do. To show their appreciation, they&amp;#039;re cutting back on the oils supply.
