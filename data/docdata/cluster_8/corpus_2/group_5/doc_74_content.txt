One does not lead to the other, and it's ludicrous to assert that it does.  All it means is that we have a different belief with respect to what it will take for the Big 3 (and, again, any other insolvent company) to become a solvent, profitable company in the future.  Believing that a government handout (or loan, whatever you want to call it) is the wrong way to go doesn't mean we want people to lose their jobs and we revel in their problems.        I want the companies to play by the rulebook established for every other company in this country and not act like they're special or better or more deserving of help than any other insolvent company in this country.  I remain unconvinced that the magnitude of the insolvency and its effects make it okay to change the rules for one group.  It doesn't mean I am looking forward to those effects and that I will enjoy the unemployment.  Not at all.                      Not every other company has to play by the same rules. Take AIG, Citibank, ATA, US Air...for example. They all have received money from the government.
