Also, if I have an ATM card that doesn't charge any fees, would I be better off using that to pull out RMB from my USD bank account?      Thanks!                      I spend a lot of time in China - 15 weeks this year. Your absolute worst deals for foreign exchange are at the airport and your hotel. Do not use either unless you absolutely, positively need to.      The BEST, by far deals you will get on foreign exchange is to use an ATM and your US bank account. I use this all the time and it works fine.      If you don't have any RMB on you at all, you can usually get your bank to change some for you before you leave, or change just a very small amount at the airport. At PDG there are several ATMs you can use upon arrival, so even this isn't necessary.       Only thing to be careful of is dodgy ATMs. Just be careful of anything that looks odd or out of the ordinary as there are people who try to clone ATM cards in China. Just use common sense and be aware of your surroundings.      Enjoy Shanghai and if you have to go to the Pudong area, take the MagLev train - MUCH, MUCH faster than a cab!
