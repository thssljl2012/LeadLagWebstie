Are you sure you read the notice correctly?                      This was an insert to the November 2008 billing statement.  I did a Google search and there are a lot of people receiving this notice.  They also raised the minimum payment from 2% of the balance to 5%.  More than double the amount.  If you have a small balance, not a big deal, but if you're carrying over $10K, it is substantial.        From the "Important Notice Regarding Changes to Your Account" flyer:      "Account Service Charge: Your account has a service charge, which will be billed monthly.... This charge is owed whether or not you use your account, and you agree to pay it when billed."      Citibank also sent an insert in November stating that they can raise the interest rate at any time.
