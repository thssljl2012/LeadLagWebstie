 I have a citibank card with a high balance as well and they just lowered my APR to 12.99%. I think I am the only one in the world who has been lowered. Anyway, last summer I called them to see if they could lower my rate and since I was such a good customer they did. They also told me to call again in 3 months and they would lower it again. They did. This time, though I didn't call them but they lowered it again anyway. Definitely call them. If you haven't missed any payments or been late I can't understand why they would raise it.
