    1. What's your name?  I'm Liz!         2. How old are you?  I'm 28...I'm on my 4th cycle TTC.         3. How many kids do you have now, and how many more do you want?  DH has an 11 yo DD and an 8 yo DS, and we have 1 18 month old DD together. I want 2 more...I think. We'll see.         4. How did you meed DH/DF/SO?  He was working at the City Zoo and I started there and we just fell in love...awwww...         5. Where do you work? Do you like it?  I work for Countrywide Home Loans, which will soon be Bank of America Mortgage...which I can't wait for the switch. I originate and process mortgages, which has only started picking up in business lately and so right now I can say I think my job is OK. Ask me in a month. :-)         6. Any pets?  We have a Choc Lab named Tootsie...she's 5. :-)
