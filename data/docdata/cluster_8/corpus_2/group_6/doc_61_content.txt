 Bank of America is the one that moved a payment date on me last year, and because we never noticed it - the payment which was normally due on the 15th became due on the 7th I think - as we hadn't noticed - we were "late" - again, no way they would reduce the rate "because you are supposed to read every statement" - ok - here is the balance, now go to hell on this card B of A.    They are a criminal enterprise in my opinion.  I hate businesses who attempt dodgy business practices as a standard way of doing business.
