I've seen 4 independent websites list the same URL for the form, so either it's legit or one of the best scams ever to hit the intrawebz.  You have until May, so it wouldn't hurt to wait until March or so to see if anyone got burned.    I doubt anyone at BoA even knows about it...and if they do they were probably told to keep quiet.  Hell, I've yet to even find a BoA employee who understands how to use their computers
