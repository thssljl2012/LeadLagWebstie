Because setting ultra low interest rates that create an artificial boom and then bailing out failed companies is capitalism? WTF? Socialism is eating itself. The market, aka capitalism, is trying to work but can't because we keep handing money to idiots.  But the more this happens, the more I kind of like these execs. They bend congress over and give it to them, taking billions so they can pay bonuses. Everyone who voted for that bailout bill in congress should be thrown out.
