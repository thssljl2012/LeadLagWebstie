It's a sad state of affairs when government causes an economic crisis, which forces private industries to take federal money, which allows government to take control of those private industries, and people just sit back and cheer them on.   When someone else's freedom to run their business how they choose is taken from them it's just fine with you because they are more successful than you. How will you feel when government sets it's sites on your industry?
