 Because using the HSA SAVES YOU MONEY.  DO YOU KNOW WHAT AN HSA EVEN IS?  Let's say I open an HSA account at Bank of America.  Any money I pull out of that account to buy ANYTHING for medical use - such a freaking bottle of aspirin even - is NO LONGER INCLUDED IN INCOME TAX.  It SAVES YOU MONEY that is why it's useful to have.  WHY should people have to pay taxes on money they are using for medical care?  WHY are you so opposed to that and think it's so horrible?  When you open and use an HSA account at a bank you no longer have to pay federal income tax on the money you are using to buy things for medical care.  Why do you feel a freaking bank savings account that eliminates the income tax on medical items is so bad?
