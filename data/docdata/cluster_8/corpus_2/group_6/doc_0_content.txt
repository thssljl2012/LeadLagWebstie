                                                             FWIW, I don't know what the banking laws are in the EU, but in the United States, many (if not most) financial institutions will not send a wire or allow the purchase of a negotiable instrument (i.e., check, draft) for an individual who does not have an account relationship.      I, too, do not understand why the originating bank in Austria has to be an "American bank".      The foreign draft option may be a good one; I remember the company formerly known as Thomas Cook (now Travelex, I think) offered them.  Citibank is a huge provider of foreign drafts as well and has an international network.  Smaller banks may not offer them anymore, as they are somewhat archaic in the world of wire transactions and cashier's cheques.      Again, I don't know what the banking laws are in the EU, but in the US, opening an account, using it to originate and send a wire, and then closing it will likely raise all sorts of red flags and alerts and may result in unwanted attention by "Big Brother".
