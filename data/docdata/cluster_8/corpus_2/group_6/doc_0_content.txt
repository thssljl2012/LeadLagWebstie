How can Jim's post say there is no cash and little assets if any if they don't have access to the Dallas Bank of America? And he is repeating Pedro and Co. are not going to be paying back the people who invested in the PDR's because it wasn't part of Pedro's Company, seems this was his thesis, right? I will be interested in hearing him tell a judge that once the evidence is presented. But,I am always told (reassured) these postings are bogus, just who isn't playing a game around here? I'm not.
