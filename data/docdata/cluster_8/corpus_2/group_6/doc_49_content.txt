 they raised their own pay to the world's highest minsterial salaries in the pretext of preventing corruption and attracting the best from the private sector; they didn't say they would be able to avert the global depression. so do u think they will cut their pay to below 'peanut' level?                     jellyfish88 wrote:                    Use the reserve for what purpose har?  So that they can increase the civil servants pay again?   They have made Singapore extremely non-competitive.  The hike in civil service pay has caused competition.  Of course we remember SM GOH's wife comment on Peanuts.  To the our government - 600k Per annum pay package is peanuts.  Moreover, is a shame how they benchmark their pay to the top notch earnings.  Do something about their pay first before even considering touching our reserve.  I must say - vote of no confidence.  Are they going to benchmark their peanuts pay again in this downturn?  Please tell me why these people are paid more than obama          Of course, you really want to be a scholar in this country.  The motto is be a scholar and rot in the the public sector.  Disclaimer : but if you commit suicide over china babes, just too bad   Not that I dont have 'A's but seriously.. his action very much spell out 'scholastic' - spastic behaviour.          Again, our scholars at work ... break the piggy bank now.  After all the bad money dumped into saving Merril, citibank.. chartered lah etc etc     There is really more than getting 'A's in academic.  Bill Gates and many of the legends does not have 'A's why our public sector is still not performance orientated? - led by scholars and downfall by them as well.
