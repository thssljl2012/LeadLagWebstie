We hae no idea what the financial penalty would have been to cancel.  When you consider the cost of canceling vs. the cost of completing the order, and factor in the value of the asset of the plane, it may have been more responsible to complete the purchase.  Don't assume that the NY Post is interested in the whole truth.  They're interested in what sells.  If they can have an exclusive of how citibank is wasting money, they don't care if it's completely tru.                         I disagree for the very reason this thread was started.  Even if it would have cost them a few million is deposits to cancel the order it would have been well worth it to prevent the bad press.  Let's face it, they already have a PR problem and this will only infuriate the public.  The same public that will pressure their Representatives to NOT allow future funding on fears that these companies do not get it and are still frivolous with our money.
