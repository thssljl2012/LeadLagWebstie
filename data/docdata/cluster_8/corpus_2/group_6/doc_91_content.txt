  We consolidated student loan through citibank. This was back when rates were 3.24 or so. I thought that the government student loans were now at around 6.5. Any way with rates low, I don't see why they won't consolidate. She should try there first.      Our loan was only about 4,000. So I do not believe there is any minimum.
