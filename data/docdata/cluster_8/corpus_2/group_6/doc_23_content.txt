Worse is i just read that PMI is only tax deductable if you make less than $110K in adjusted gross income, so now I am really fukked.       Extra $150 - $180  a month in the garbage for at least 5+ years until I hit around 20% equity / 80% LTV (I was doing 10% down)      Now I may look at the Bank of America "No fees "loan. I have great credit so the rate is not bad, plus they pay all closing costs, and waive PMI. They did this for those with 5% and 10% down, but now I am hearing if you live in a declining area (and what area IS NOT a declining market in the US right now!?!?) you need 15% down for this special deal. BUT NOBODY WOULD WANT THIS DEAL OR NEED IT IF THEY HAD 15-20% DOWN! PMI IS NOT AN ISSUE FOR THEM !!!      DECISIONS....                      It doesnt make sense for PMI to be apart of APR. It is private mortgage insurance that is included in your monthly payment. Paid to a company. It is not apart of closing costs unless you are actually speaking about MIP. If it is MIP you pay 1.5% to the govt at closing which would raise your apr.      PMI is for conventional loans--1/10 effects apr unless you are paying it up front   MIP is for FHA----effect apr
