 Are any of the local banks or credit unions better than the national chains in and around St. Louis? Looking for a bank with physical branches in the St. Louis area that pays decent (at least a few percent) on money markey accounts.     Rockwood bank doesn't post their rates online. It looks like US Bank and Bank of America have large presences. Am I missing any others?     Thanks!
