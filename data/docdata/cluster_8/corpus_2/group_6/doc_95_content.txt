Savings accounts are a non issue, they already return less than they end up costing.  If banks were nationalized (As they should be) then instead of just shoving your money in the bank and hoarding it for a trickle of income, you would invest your funds in higher risk ventures that in turn stimulate the economy and provide jobs.   Banks have increasingly diminishing operating costs and overcharge in interest thanks to technology.  Credit unions, on the other hand, could be a much fairer way to distribute and manage money for communities.  The real problem here is when private banks go national, they tend to get bloated and innefficient, ultimatley requiring bailouts.
