The &amp;quot;insurance&amp;quot; is working with other reputable financial institutions - banks.        Generally, a major retailer (say Bon Ton, Walmart, Target, Toys R Us, etc...) will issue a letter of credit based on a line of credit offered by a U.S. bank.  This does not mean they do their daily banking there... just that they do their trade financing.        Over here if China Agricultural Bank receives a Letter of Credit for, say, 4 million dollars woth of DVD players, they would normally look at the issuing bank and if it was someone huge and healthy, they'd have no problems honoring it.  If the buyer is a big known entity that tends to prove nothing, as we all know, The Wiz, Circuit City, etc.. all had big names but went down.        Now the banks here find that the bank proferring the letter of credit to them, say Lehmann Brothers, is only as good as tomorrow morning's headlines.  They just plain don't know whether they can trust the goldplated names of yesteryear.         This is all really just an interesting sidebar to the big show.  Retailers have driven the prices down so far over here that in the current environment, tens of thousands of factories in China are closing down.  The retailers, of course, have not rushed to their rescue.  Instead, they're demanding longer and longer credit terms from the factories, forcing them to go to their own banks for financing.  Many who cannot afford to do that or get said financing are simply closing down.
