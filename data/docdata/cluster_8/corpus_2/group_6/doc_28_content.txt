Of course that 38 cents per gallon figure assumes fuel is $4/gal.  Lots of those gas credit card offers have a teaser rebate for 90 days then roll back to around 4%.  I get 4% on my citgo mastercard... am all online paying it so I don't need to waste a stamp.  Most gas brands have a similar deal.  Had a citibank rewards card that was 5% on all brands gas and groceries for almost a year then they changed the terms down to 2%.
