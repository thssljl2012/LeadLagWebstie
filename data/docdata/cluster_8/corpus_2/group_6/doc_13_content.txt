  I don't know if this is the right place to put this, but I value this boards advice....though sometimes unnecessarily harsh, it can be very insightful.      I have been working really hard on developing a plan for myself so that I can regain some identity and finally start living my life for myself. While at thepresent moment I intend to remain married to my husband, I would still like to regain my financial independence. I spoke with a financial planner who suggested that due to my husband's irresponsibility, that I need to separate my debt as quickly as possible and work on fixing  "my"  credit instead  "our"  credit. Does anyone have any ideas or been-there-done-that?      Just to give you an idea of my financial situtation:      These montly bills are all in my name only due to DH's very poor credit:   Utilities (gas, electric, water)   Cellphone   Satellite   Car loan   Car Insurance   Renter's Insurance   3 Department store credit cards   1 Citibank credit card (I am the primary, though he is an authorized user)      In addition to those monthly bills, there is also a substantial amount of medical bills in my name, and I also have a very large chunk of studen loans. The total amount of debt in my name amounts to $90,000...this does not include the monthly bills in the first list. Obviously I need to get a job. My parents just bought us a second car (so I will have to add to my current insurance bill-liability only as it's a 13 yo car), so this will be a reality very soon. But I know I will need to add in the cost of childcare, clothing for work, meals, etc. I am searching online everyday and do see a lot of opportunities for me, and I have a recommendation for a daycare that's inexpensive and close by. Really, I'm just waiting until I can get the second car so that I will have the ability to do the necessary commuting for work. Any help greatly appreciated. TIA
