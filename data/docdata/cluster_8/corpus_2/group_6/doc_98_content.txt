Why don't they just bounce checks or decline debit card purchases like banks used to?  Oh yeah...I know why...that's right, they are making a fortune from the fees....                           Yep. . .they would never bother to tell us there was a hold on a check. You'd use the debit card after a deposit and it would go thru. . .pay bills, etc. Next thing you knew a bunch of money was gone in fees. At least with Wells Fargo they would tell you when you made the deposit if there was a hold and for how long. Plus the BoA branch by us was awful! There wasn't a time I was in there that I can remember that sombody wasn't getting irrate at one of the tellers. It was in a area with lots of small businesses, so I imagine others were going thru the same crap.
