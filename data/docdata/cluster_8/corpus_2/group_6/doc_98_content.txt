No. But, it is fair to say the experience so far has cost me, and I expect to pay more than I thought I was going to in total to get the product. However, the biggest winner seems to be Wells Fargo (my US bank), not the Pandora team.      AAAARRRRRRFGGGGHHHHHHFHFGHGHHH!!! How many times does this need to be explained, it is NOT fair to say the experience has cost you because the team is only expecting you to pay the amount you were refunded, no more, no less. Just paint whatever money you received as 'Pandora money' and you'll see as long as you re-order everything is fine.  I know you were being reasonable about it but it feels frustrating when people still aren't picking up on the fact that you haven't lost any money if you actually re-order.      Almost as annoying as people not realising their could be associated fees on top(see theread 2 up) which ARE costing people money!      ...and frustrating that you see people trying to poke holes in statements where there were none to find. If the OpenPandora team isn't expecting people to pay extra when re-ordering then this means THEY cover the exchange rate fees. FFS!!!
