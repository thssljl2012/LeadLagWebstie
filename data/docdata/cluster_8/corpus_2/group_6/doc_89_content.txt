Obama talked a good talk during his bid for office, vowing to rescue the families who are facing homelessness, and making things right with the economy. We will soon see if his inexperience with Foreign Policy, Economics and the Military can help him walk the walk. Funny, white people can't get aid from the government or even a phone number that answers, but African Americans and Hispanics and those here illegally can. I watched WFTV with interest tonight as 2 buses full of students loaded up to go to Washington D.C. for the Inauguration, not one white student was among them. Funny, no one is out burning down buildings and screaming discrimination are they?     Exactly very well put!
