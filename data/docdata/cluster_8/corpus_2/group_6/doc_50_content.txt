    Either way GM is not yet in a prearranged &amp;nbsp;bankruptcy nor have they &amp;nbsp;made public any kind of outline thereof.   &amp;nbsp;   ----------------------   &amp;nbsp;    Bugs - Take a look at CITI, Citibank    &amp;nbsp;    Remember when Citibank was bailedout, just a few months ago?    &amp;nbsp;    Understand, Citibank could be allowed to go into bankruptcy.      Many banks and brokerages hold money in Citibank    &amp;nbsp;    If Citibank went into chapter 11 - The stock market would have crashed to 4000.    &amp;nbsp;    The Government is doing their best, to prevent a panic.      A panic - Where the consumer stops buying, causing a depression.    &amp;nbsp;    No one wants a depression.      Unfortunatily - the consumer is tapped out.&amp;nbsp; The consumer has too much debt.&amp;nbsp; Foreclosures and auto repos - ect ect.    &amp;nbsp;    Citibank is going through bankruptcy      You will not read any reports - But if you are smart, you can read between the lines.    &amp;nbsp;    Citibank will be broken into smaller parts and sold off.      The parts will be sold for less than the price of the whole.      Thus - Someone will take a loss.      Shareholders, Bondholders, and Taxpayers.    &amp;nbsp;    Same thing is going on at GM.    &amp;nbsp;    How will it all play out ?      No one knows exactly.    &amp;nbsp;    Ford could buy the Chevy divivision ?      Bits and parts will be sold off - to satisfy creditors.      The UAW is a major creditior, via legacy costs due.    &amp;nbsp;    I dont know the final result      Just as I dont know, who will buy the bits and parts of Citigroup.      I just know Citibank is insolvent.      Just as GM is insolvent.    &amp;nbsp;    How do you know GM is insolvent?    &amp;nbsp;    Watching Ricky fly to washington in a private jet - begging ?      Carl Lutz - Standing in-line at a Northwest airline check in is a small clue. Hehehehehehehe    &amp;nbsp;    Ricky - Threaten Washington, to close the doors, if Tarp money is withheld from GM    &amp;nbsp;    Sometimes the Government, is not totally honest ?      Remember when Hank Paulson told the public - Lehman Brothers has plenty of cash - No worries.      10 days later - Lehman filed chapter 11    &amp;nbsp;    Sometimes, one has to read between the lines.
