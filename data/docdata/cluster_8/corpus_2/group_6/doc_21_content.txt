also with prices of homes now, not everyone can afford to buy a home, but the banks put them in one anyway. Community Reinvestment Act my a$$. the govt forces a bank to make loans in the community in which they are located giving loans that MIGHT work on paper but in reality cant possibly work, then they regulators come in and criticize the loans that were made. look young people looking for house nowadays are looking at $300+ mort and monthly pymnt of maybe 1700-1800 in principle and interst. then add taxes and they looking @$2500/month. maybe they each make $40-45k. on paper it works...then add expenses like LIPA, food, fuel, car pymnt, those credit cards that you got to zero to get the mort slowly creep up, then kids arrive, clothes, cable, etc... pretty soon that combined $90k just doesnt cut it...
