CEO HUSSEY just sitting on his hands!! In all my years, I've have not seen such laizze faire CEO as Spectrum CEO Hussey. I mean we have a company with $2.4 billion in revenues. That's billions people and our CEO just sits and watches the price of our stock manipulated down to almost subpenny. The market cap is now barely $2 million!!!!!! My GAWD!!!! Why isn't he doing something or saying something?????? The CEOs of America are unbelievable!! They get 7 and 8 figure salries and seem to think they are the company. The Bank of America CEO arse that was fired today, actually took 100K of the US TARP funds and spent it on 3 chairs for his office. Three freakin chairs for 100K!!! That jerk needs to be tarred and feathered and sent to Cuba to live out the rest of his life!!! So here we have Hussey with his 7 figure salary and bonus. And when is the last time we hear from him. Oh his interview last November in the Atlanta Journal where is saying he's so excited about moving HQ to Atlanta so he could join the race track club!!! HELLO HUSSEY!!!! KNOCK KNOCK!!!! YOUR FREAKIN JOB IS TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF SHAREHOLDER EQUITY!!! FIRST THING REAL CEOs LEARN!!!!! This isn't rocket science!! A real CEO that cared about shareholders rather than muscle cars might: 1. Put out shareholder letter explaining how SPC can easily survice on cash flow. 2. Put inof on how to get off OTC. 3. CEO and Directors take say 20-40K of their HUGE salaries and BUY some cheap shares to show their committment to company and shareholders. ETC ETC ETC&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; EARTH TO HUSSEY!!!! WE ARE SINKING!!! WAKE UP!!! IF you want to race cars, we can make that permanent and get a CEO that cares about shareholders!!!!
