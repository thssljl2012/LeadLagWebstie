That's why a lot of places charge you etc for handling a transaction that isn't check , cash, or money order       Or all in all they don't accept any other form of payment but cash, check, money order                        hmmm, if that's true just pay from their website., I know Bank of America let's me pay anyone, it's the same as if I wrote a personal check but instead of me writing it they print it up and send it out to anyone no fee.       And basically every wireless company has online pay from their website, a lot of utility companies let you pay online too, I can't remember the last time I wasted $0.40+cents on a postage stamp. Waste of time, waste of paper, and a waste of money.
