  so once again bank of america, mymain credit card, is busily mailing me those "access checks" so I could dig myself a big hole by writing a check for my mortgage or whatever. I've never used those and I've called multiple times asking them to stop sending them. But I'm resigned to it now, I'm a good customer and they'll never stop sending these. I shred them.      Still I think they are taking a tremendous chance. what if I don't have a shredder and these access checks accidentally end up in the handsof a struggling neighbor or someone happens to steal them from my mailbox? he/she uses them, and correct me if I'm wrong but in cases of fraud, Bank of America would be left holding the bag as the card issuer?      for that matter what is to stop people with lots of access to creditfrom selling these access checks to struggling friends or neighbors? It would be a difficult crime to prove I would think.
