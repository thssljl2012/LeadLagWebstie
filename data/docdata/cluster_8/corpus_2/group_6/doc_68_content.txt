But you never know what they may have given.      We are told the best acts of charity is to give without making a big fuss over it (in secret), and I truly hope that they have.      But in the same instance its a business decision, though one wonders about the ROI.      Its the same arabs that pumped BILLIONS into the failing citibank group too, what chance of getting any ROI on their capital?                      Kaka is not a Millwall type player.         Bro, do you honestly think that these people are going to rebuild Gaza with their money? Or do you think they're going to focus on promoting their little dens of iniquity in the middle of the desert?
