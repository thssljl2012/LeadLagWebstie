  Bank of America would be left holding the bag as the card issuer?  i doubt that it would be "painless" to us if someone stole them and used them. the onus is on you to clear up your "almighty credit from the godlike agencies"  they will still send them after you tell them not to. they want you to have them and use them. you have no power, even not using the account but leaving it open.
