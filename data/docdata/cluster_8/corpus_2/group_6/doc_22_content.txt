      We are looking to refinance our mortgage and are having difficulty determining which option will be the best value. We currently owe $205K and the house is worth approximately $300K. We plan to stay in the house long term, and both have excellent credit scores. I know the HELOC rate is currently very low but it has been at over 10% in the past and I would like to have just one fixed rate 30 year mortgage. My instinct says USAA. What does everyone else think? Also, should we attempt to roll in the closing costs to the new mortgage or just pay cash? Thanks for any help offered.       Current Mortgage (90/15 loan)    1st &amp;#8211; 30 year fixed at 6.375% - balance of $187K   $1223 ($1466 PITI &amp;#8211; about to be approximately $1550 due to increase in property tax)   2nd &amp;#8211; HELOC 4.12% variable &amp;#8211; balance of $18K, current payment $71         BB&amp;amp;T    5.25% (0 points) &amp;#8211; 30 year fixed   $1132 ($1486 PITI)   Closing costs = $3246 (does not include advances for taxes, escrow, hazard insurance etc)       USAA    4.875% (1 point) &amp;#8211; 30 year fixed   $1085 (1439 PITI)   Closing costs = $4744 (does not include advances for taxes, escrow, hazard insurance etc)       Bank of America    5% (1.125 points) &amp;#8211; 30 year fixed   $1100 ($1454 PITI)   Closing costs = $5148 (does not include advances for taxes, escrow, hazard insurance etc)
