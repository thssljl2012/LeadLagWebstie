I had 14,000 charged in one day on my debit card "Bank of America" this was placed in pending catagory and had not completely went through. You can stop check anywhere in line but a card cannot be stopped. To make matters worse one charge was a health spa in Italy. Takes two weeks to process oversea transaction. BOA says you money will be replaced next day. NOT. Money was not replaced till overseas cleared which was two weeks the account was on hold
