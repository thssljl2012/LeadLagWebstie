 http://boortz.com/nealz_nuze/2009/01/fro...       After they take billions in taxpayer money they want to spend $50 million on a jet?  I know it was ordered two years ago, but don&#039;t they understand that their business is on the verge of bankruptcy and they should cancel the order instead of using taxpayer money for corporate pampering.      How many people are going to wake up and vote with their wallet?  Who is closing thier citi accounts?
