I'm not surprised either and the love of money has fueled the disaster. When CEOs make bad decisions that are risky and it all falls apart not all are fired. Yet, if an employee makes a mistake, they are fired. This is just plain nuts and stupid. Then you have Citibank (another article) who just cancelled plans for a foreign made airplane for execs. They were bailed out and it's good thing they cancelled. This is just nuts. They never should have ordered it in the first place.
