My bank of America CC sends me the checks with 0% interest for 6-9 or 12 months every month (current 0 balance)....so they may send you offers for that eventually.  I would not continue opening accounts but that is just me.      And if you are good at paying off stuff, go ahead and save money and avoid the 3% fee up front for using the 0% from them.
