 There are some programs now, varying by state, to help those with interest only mortgages (I know that paying an extra $500 a month would KILus, which is why we always opted for fixed).  I'd look into  that first.  Also, Bank of America and some others are supposed to be helping folks from Countrywide, who they bought out, get more reasonable financing.  I'd check w/the state first, and then, equipped w/that info, contact your lender.        If you do choose to explore the refinance route, we can't tell you, because you have to really shop for the best rate, based on your payment history.  Get copies of your credit report for the shopping so you don't have tons of inquiries out there.  Usually, though, a company like Credco pulls it for the mortgage companies, who pay them, then charge you their fee plus profit.  Once Credco pulls it, different lenders can use their data, although if you go forward, the final company will pull an update before committing to financing and again before closing.
