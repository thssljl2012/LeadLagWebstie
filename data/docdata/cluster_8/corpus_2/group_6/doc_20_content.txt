It is the liberal Democratic policy of forcing banks to make loans to people they know aren't qualified that got us here. Think Bill Clinton, Chris Dodd and Barney Franks. What exactly do you think a 'toxic' loan is? It is simply one that won't be paid back! Banks were forced to make thousands of these, sued in fact to force them to make bad loans to illegal immigrants, minorities with no way or intent to pay back, etc. Your boy Obama was the lawyer for some Hispanics that sued Bank of America. He knows exactly why we're here. It is called the Community Reinvestment Act.
