RV Gringo, i'm curious about the income requirement as well.  i moved to the lake chapala area in April of 2008.  when i applied for my FM3, i provided three bank statements which showed deposits for the months of february, march, and april of 2008 in excess of $1500US a month since i was working in the US for those months.  i have had no income since and will not start US social security until November of 2009.        when i renew my FM3 this year, my bank statements (as they stand) will show no deposits for the months of february, march, and april.  however, i have more than enough in my US bank to certainly cover the annual cost of living here.  someone told me that my best bet was, for those months, just to transfer money from my savings account into my checking account and that would appear to the FM3 people as "income."  of course, it's not, it's just moving money around.  but do you think that this will work when i apply for my renewal?        thanks!  barb      p.s.  folks, if you don't live in the lake chapala area then you probably don't know this, but RV Gringo is a GREAT source of information on this and other forums.  the man knows whereof he speaks and is always willing to help, even in answering for the 9,875th time "what's the best route to take to lake chapala?"!!
