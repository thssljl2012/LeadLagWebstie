         Not sure I get your point. Just deposit your check a the nearest atm and spend the money like a good consumer. How is it that hard to do? If the problem is that your credit union has no branch/atm, then the problem is with that credit unions, so close your account and open one with BofA, which has an atm less than a mile away from you no matter where you are in usa.  On a side note, USA is to my knowledge the last industrialized country where anyone still use checks. Nowaday people use their computer to access a network invented by Al Gore named &amp;quot;the interweb&amp;quot;, from which they access their accounts online to transfer money. Except for when I go to US, I'm not sure I remember the last time I saw a check.
