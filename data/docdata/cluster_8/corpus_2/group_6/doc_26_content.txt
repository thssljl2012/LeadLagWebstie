         From where I sit, Bush pardoned the Boards of Citibank, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, just for starters.  Why they didn't pardon Lehman Bros and Bear Stearns is kind of a mystery.  He pardoned all the liar loan real estate speculators and the sleazy subprime loan pushers.  He pardoned whoever manipulated oil prices to lofty levels.  He pardoned all the "hear no evil, see no evil speak no evil" political hack regulators he appointed.  Everything has been sort of folded into a "bad business judgement"..."mistakes were made" kind of a situation which leaves the rest of use wondering where the next bubble is going to be and how we might cash in since there doesn't seem to be any right or wrong anymore, or at least no penalties as long as you get out early.  Me, I can't believe the only crooks out there were Bernie Madoff and a few sleazy hedge fund managers.  But that's just me.
