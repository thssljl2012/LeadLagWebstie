 Pattie,      I know this is not exactly the same situation as yours because our experience relates to insurance that we purchased personally - not through work - from a nationwide insurance company.        When we applied for life insurance, we found out that DH was diabetic after the insurance company did the usual blood/urine specimens.  We were told that he would have to pay considerably more for his coverage because he was diabetic.  We have never tried to increase his coverage, and we were basically told it would not be possible/affordable to increase it.  However, we were able to increase mine - this was before my cancer diagnosis.      Your certificate of insurance should spell out the conditions for the "review" they are requesting.  I would certainly look over your certificate and make sure they are following procedure.      You may also want to call the Illinois Department of Insurance in Springfield and ask them about this.  This is where you complain if you believe an insurance company is not treating you fairly.
