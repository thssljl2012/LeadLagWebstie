I called the customer service number for IDNinja. https://www.idninja.com/userarea/support 1-866-505-3146 When I called, I selected option #2 for ID theft insurance. It transferred me to the claims department of AIG!!!!!! Here is the AIG website for thier identity theft coverage. http://www.aig.com/Personal-Identity-Coverage_20_2146.html#tab1Dtls It looks like AIG Personal Identity Coverage is the policy covering all of Guard Dog's products!!!!!!
