Perhaps there was a lone moron that voted present because he realized that the gov. was indicted less than 24 hrs. of announcing the state of Ill. would no longer do business with Bank of America for screwing the workers by not allowing payroll funds to go thru'. Funny how a 3 yr. investigation can occur before Obama even tossed his non-natural born hat into the POTUS ring. By the way, what happened to innocent before proven guilty? Don't get sucked up into msm hype. That's what &amp;quot;they&amp;quot; are counting on.
