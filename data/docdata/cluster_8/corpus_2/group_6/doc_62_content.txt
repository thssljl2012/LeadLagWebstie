Not every body in financial trouble today is there because of being irresponsible. Many of the people that bought homes that they couldn't afford did so chasing a dream, and the people lending them the money knew they were ripe for the picking and showed them just how they could afford it. This country is not in the condition that it is in because of little people chasing dreams, It is in this condition because of the greed of the big guy who plays on the weakness of people and there dreams knowing full well what most likely is going to happen. Well this time they over played their hand and as a result here we are, little people being blamed and big people being baled out. Now, who do you think is hurting the most, the little guy or the big guy? Eter--- if you want to place blame place it on the people who  controls the money, ya the same ones that are eating stake, flying high and getting bailed out!
