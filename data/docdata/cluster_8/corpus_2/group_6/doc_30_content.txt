Supervisors are definitely the way to go!! Often they'll forgive a single missed payment. Also, if I'm not mistaken the way most companies do it is that they give you the 1% reduction after 12 consecutive months. So even if you missed this first month and don't get another deferment you basically reset the cycle when you make the first on-time payment.  Chase is giving you a pretty good deal BTW. I have Citibank and DIrect Loans and mine have a tiered discount and I don't get the full 1% until 36 consecutive payments!
