 The fool is still at it.....        Alright David,    Thanks for your timely response.I have forwarded your vehicle information to my customer,and i am delighted to to inform you that he has concented it with keen    interest,after evaluating it.I have also discussed the payment issue with him and due to time constraint,he has instructed me to carry on with this transaction immediately.         Secondly,he instructed me to inform you that your payment will include the shipper's charges and trips for pick up of your vehicle and and other items.You will recieve the payment IN YOUR NAME,IN A US BANK CERTIFIED CASHIERS CHECK of $17,900, The amount has to be so,for record and account purposes in his company.So you are required to deduct the cost of your vehicle $10,500,when payment gets to you and forward the balance of $7,400,to our shipper and his agent for them to be able to offset shipping &amp; tax charges, and other cosmetic repair costs.         After payment has reached you and balance sent to shipper, the shipper's agent will come for pick up (of vehicle &amp; signing of title papers), make some cosmetic touches and drive to the prepaid shipper to be shipped to my customer.         Please confirm this and forward the following informations,for your payment to be sent to you asap;    Names:.......    Address:.......    Phone number:........    Kindly bear in mind that your honesty, understanding and co-operation will be highly demanded and appreciated in this transaction.
