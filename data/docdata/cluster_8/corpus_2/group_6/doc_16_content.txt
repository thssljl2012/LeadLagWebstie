Bank of American does not allow online wire transfers, but both they and Wells Fargo can set up your account for telephone initiated wires. the probably for non-residents is you must visit the bank in person to fill out the forms and then they send you a wire Pin to use, also for security purposes they call you back each time to confirm the wire to your home phone number of record.
