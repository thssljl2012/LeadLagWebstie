Don't rely on a dealership for financing.  Go to a local bank, preferably a truly local bank or credit union rather than your local branch of KeyBank or Bank of America or whatever.  It's a bit more of a hassle since you have to close your loan at the bank rather than doing everything right at the dealership, but you'll be much better off in the long run.  A dealership considers 9.99% APR on a new bike loan a great deal, and will sometimes charge you above 13%.  I went through my credit union and got a rate of 5.7% on a used bike.
