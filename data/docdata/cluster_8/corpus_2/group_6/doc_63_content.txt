Pretty disgusting, but I'm afraid typical of the desperation for money by the nearly bankrupt California state government.  Even more disgusting was the fact that Bank of America apparently didn't make any attempt to contact Carla Ruff, even though they had her name and address on file, and she had paid her box rental.  Unfortunately, our government has annointed BAC as a bank that can't be allowed to fail, while it pushed what was probably the most consumer-friendly bank, Wachovia, into a merger
