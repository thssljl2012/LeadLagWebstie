The government stepping in and propping up other companies will prevent the CDSes from exploding horribly, and AIG will continue to be a profitable insurer. This is a company making a net income of more than $10bn/year; it might take them some time to pay back the loan, but it's not the pie in the sky fantasy you seem to think it is.     But AIG's insurance operations are not profitable. Investment income had let them price insurance premiums at a much lower level than could possibly be profitable except for the fact taht they funneled the money into junk. Well, the gravy train is over, but the market conditions they created in the insurance marketplace have left them unable to turn a profit.  AIG will only survive as a shell of its current self if it tries to pay back a significant chunk of its debt to the public. It will have to divest itself of a number of profitable divisions, and then increase underwriting dicipline and raise rates. In the short term there will eb a bloodletting as clients run to cheaper carriers, but if they survive a year after that the rest of the market will have to follow suit to recapitalize also.
