                        Anyone seen this post that was emailed to Sparky?      If anything, the Citigroup shares seems strong this morning ...          Sparky       It starts/ends with Citi?    Thread Started Today at 3:47am          --------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Forigve me if someone has already discussed this. I haven't had much time to go through all the posts on the board over the last month.      I work at a local Supermarket as a cashier and the other day, we received notification that we are no longer to accept Citibank checks as the bank is going under.       I know that several gurus (mainly Acca and Jay) said to watch Citi as our outcome is tied directly to it. Just thought I'd bring this to the board.
