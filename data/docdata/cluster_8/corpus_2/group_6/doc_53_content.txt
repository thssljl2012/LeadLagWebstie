       With fading respect growing for me as it relates to the B of A CEO, this hosted conference three days after he gets $25 B in TARP funds is the last straw. Ironically, I'm against this unionization plan as many of the problem at GM can be laid on padded union contracts.  But the audacity of the Home Depot guy to be complaining about not being out on his 350 ft yacht but was on the call to figure out ways to circumvent campaign contribution laws is beyond belief. What was it 8,000 Home Depot employees fired this week?  We need jobs........we need taxpayers earning money and buying products.   http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/27/bank-of-america-hosted-an_n_161248.html
