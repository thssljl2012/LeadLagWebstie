          You&#039;re right in that the best of credit ratings in the US means absolutely nothing in the UK. Sad, but true.  What you can do from the US -- 1. Get an account with a bank that also has branches in the UK. i only know of HSBC. Anybody know of any others? 2. Make sure you get a debit card for your US bank account so that in a pinch you can get cash from an ATM.   Once you are here -- 1. For a flat, look in local papers for private landlords. My experience they don&#039;t ask a lot of questions as long as you pay a deposit and always pay on time. 2. Do follow the other poster&#039;s advice to get one of those secured credit cards. It&#039;ll have a paltry limit, but it&#039;s better than nothing.  Hope that is of some use.
