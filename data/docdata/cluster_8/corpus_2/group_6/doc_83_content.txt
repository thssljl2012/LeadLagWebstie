Call me naieve, but there is something called "Economy Class" on something called "Commercial Airlines." Hey CEOs, ever heard of that?      If they want to cut costs, which they need to do, then actually cut costs!!!!                      You didn't even need to ask...You're naive. CEO's and the top brass don't run multi-billion dollar companies flying around on Southwest. The corporate jet is a tool companies use to be more productive. They can work from the second they get on the plane, till the second they step off. They can have face-to-face meetings with other executives while rmaining comfortable and relaxed. They don't have to listen to screaming babies, worry about making their connection, or getting stuck in a middle seat.      More importantly, they go when THEY want to go and they go where THEY want to go. They're not at the mercy of an airlines schedule, and they can go to an airport that is much closer to where the actual work is being done.     This is an actual trip I am doing on thursday in the Citation Excel, lets see if you can match it with an airline schedule:     0800 Salt Lake City, Ut-Torrington, WY  1100 Torrington, WY -Gillette, WY  1230 Gillette, WY-Carson City, NV  1630 Carson City, NV-Santa Ana, CA  1945 Santa Ana, CA-Salt Lake City, Ut.     Home by 2230.     Plus, the passengers can arrive AT the airport at departure time...they drive right to the door of the airplane. No security....no hour and a half before departure arrival time....get on and go. Their airplane makes them more successful than their competitors: They can manage the job sites....hands on, in 3 different states, and still be home in time for a late dinner and to kiss their kids goodnight.     So yes, LAX, you are naieve. And thats ok...not a whole lot of folks really know what goes on in this realm of aviation.     Citibank would not be able to run their company as effectivly without the use of their jet. Taxpayer funded, or not.
