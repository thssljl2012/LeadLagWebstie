  We opened a Commonwealth Bank account in the UK before we came out.      As soon as we landed in adelaide we went to the bank and our EFTPOS cards and account was waiting for us.      We were asked if we wanted a credit card but thought we wouldn't be able as like you we were on a SIR plus we didn't have jobs.      A week later our cards came.        We know of a few more SIR holders who got a credit card no problems.      Graham
