Did any of you personally see the market of 2008 coming? Or the ensuing bank debacles? Or massive oil price fall?  Lets just say the *majority* did NOT. Why? Because the majority is always wrong. Its a now famous quote from John Kenneth Galbraith, senior economic adviser to JFK and many other US presidents in the 20th century.  Here his concept is applied to &amp;quot;the end of the world&amp;quot; sayers in 1975:  http://mast-economy.blogspot.com/2008/12/remember. ...   But Id argue that you could apply it to the majority of experts last year. They were wrong.  Now I'll also argue that you can apply Galbraith's concept to today's chants. Given most of what I read currently, the consensus of many is more gloom for 2009 and the worst is yet to come mantra.  So, the majority is wrong again this year. And I think Galbraith and would agree with me.  Poll the masses, determine the majority opinion on the economy... then bet against it.  GNE  http://goodnewsecon.com  (no gloom and doom here)
