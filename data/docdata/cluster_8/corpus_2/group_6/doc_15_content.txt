        And why would we nationalize the banking industry?   We already nationalized a big chunk of the insurance business with AIG and a big chunk of the mortgage business with fred and fan. Citi is not viable. It's current market cap is less than the funds it got from the government.   If, through some miracle, asset classes started going up in value right now, maybe things could change. What do you think are the odds of that happening? It looks to me like they will decline throughout the year at least.  And if they do... the banks are toast.
