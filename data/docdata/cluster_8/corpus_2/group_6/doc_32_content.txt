             Quote:      evZENy                           Thanks, guys    I will move to CH earlier than my wife, so she might be able to transfer the money. I talked with UBS USA yesterday - can't do it with them, as they don't offer cross border accounts. Go figure!    As other options I also thought     1) Keep on using my USA credit cards and pay online with the US bank accounts as I currently do (found a card with no international transfer fees, but this is for now)    2) Open an account with online bank (like Capital One), which might allow online transfers more easily.    The 401(k) into IRA and then ...? will be trickier...    P.S. Yes, EU is not same as Europe. And CH is its own beast, isn't it? :-)                                I've heard some people say that the Post Finance ( http://www.postfinance.ch ), the finance arm of the Swiss postal service, is willing to open accounts on line for people who are moving over here, so perhaps you should check them out - the site is in English.    Good luck,    Jim.
