I think it's funny how they were the only ones that didn't need the bailout months ago and now all of the sudden they are going under???     "Nothing" will happen because the Federal Government will rescue BOA, along with Merrill, via the TARP monies and more taxpayer funding.  The original size of the TARP (700 Billion) is likely to balloon to (I'll estimate) 1.3 Trillion.  It is absolutely criminal, what bankers have been allowed to get away with.  Anyone with a brain who was in the industry over the past decade ... and I was, at two banks ... could of saw this coming.  We all will be paying for this, literally, for the rest of our lives.     I got out 3 years ago.  Complete 180, and still somewhat in the process.
