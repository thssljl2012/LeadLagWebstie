First of all even if I had wanted a different or riskier product, my mortgage bank would not have underwritten my loan. They weren't Countrywide or Bank of America.   Because the fault lies primarily with the financial geniuses who created the products, the financial hucksters who marketed them, the financial morons who underwrote them, the financial swindlers who insured them, the greedy...  All brought to you by the Republican deregulation movement of the 1980s and 1990s.  Yes, many of the consumers of the financial products were stupid, ill-informed, and greedy but how can you not blame the financial experts and specialists who created the products?
