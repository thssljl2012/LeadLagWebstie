While it may be necessary to make a transfer in euros to help make the sum received predictable, it also likely will be more costly than making the transfer in dollars, with the conversion to be done by the receiving bank.   As I understand it, Paypal exchange rates are unfavorable, though they may be no more so than those practiced by a U.S. bank, especially a small bank. (Also, the Paypal service comes with a cost for the recipient that likely is factored into the price of the lodging.)  Our French bank, LCL, now charges 16 euros for an incoming wire transfer from North America or  Asia. There also are stiff fees for the deposit of any check issued outside France, including checks written in euros. Ditto for travelers checks, including euro denominated ones.  There doesn't seem to be an easy, economical way to transfer small amounts of funds internationally, but I'll be checking on the service suggested above and watching this thread with interest.  You can always ask an owner if he or she would be willing to hold a negotiable check, to be replaced with cash after you arrive. In France, this is a relatively common practice.
