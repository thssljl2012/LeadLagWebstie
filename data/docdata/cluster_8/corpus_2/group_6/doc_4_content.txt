I currently  have auto insurance with AIG.  But they are charging me $2k per year with no accidents/tickets in the past 4 years.  I called Geico and they are going to charge around $1,100 for the whole year.  However, it will be a higher deductible and less coverage on the property damage.      Anyone else have Geico?  Good company?  thanks
