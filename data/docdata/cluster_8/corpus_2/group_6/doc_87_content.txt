 For the past several years Visa miles posted to my bank of america account exactly 2 days after account closing. Even during holiday periods.  It has been over a week and a half since December's statement closed and no miles yet. Normally I wouldn't complain or care but I've had a terribly negative experience with their customer service people and want to close it but I'd like my last batch of miles to post first.    Is this just my account or is anybody else having the same delay?
