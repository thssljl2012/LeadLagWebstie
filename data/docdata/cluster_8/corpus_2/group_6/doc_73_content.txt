The agent that I talked to said that this is a fairly common problem.      My suggestion is to call HHonors and see how many accounts you have and get them all combined.                      This is a good idea, as I have received three separate HH membership cards in the mail.  Unfortunately, I don't think I kept them all, as I thought they were duplicates.  But I assume I can call HH and they can figure out how many accounts I may have.
