 You don't have to report it to your insurance plus you don't want to risk any chances of your premium going up. If you made a claim through your insurance company, they will be compensating you and then will recoop the costs from the other drivers insurance company. If you go directly through the other drivers insurance company they should be compensating you and probably will respond better than your insurance company. When I was rear ended, the other drivers insurance company (AIG) sent an adjustor, gave an estimate of damages and sent me a check to go to any shop. If the check didn't cover the costs at the body shop, the shop would then call AIG to make adjustments to the estimate and get approval for additional work.
