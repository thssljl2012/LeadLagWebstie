Chrysler will survive. We gave 168 billion dollars to AIG insurance and they turn around and throw big parties. Revoke that money and give it to the US auto industry. Better yet, give every American TAX PAYER (not the freeloaders) 2 million dollars. BAM!!! Fincial crisis solved, economy back on track, people buying cars and houses.
