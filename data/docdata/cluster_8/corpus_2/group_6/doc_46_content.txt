That's EXACTLY what Obama is trying to sell to America - and it's wrong.  Everyone here (I would expect, anyway) should know without second-guessing themselves that it's wrong.    And yet we have people posting criticism of that coach and that win.  I'm blown away by that.    That's like saying Bill Gates should have stopped at $1 billion dollars and let some of the competition catch up to be nice.  That Citibank should have stopped at 10 million customers and let some of the smaller, less fortunate financial institutions catch up or save face a little.  It's not nice that you're making twice as much money as your neighbor, so you should stay home from work a couple days each week.    What the heck kind of thinking is THAT?!?        Nobody is criticizing the win.. maybe you should pay closer attention.      And again I ask:      How does a Christian team    humiliating    a team with learning disabilities and lack of skill portray Christian and/or Conservative values?
