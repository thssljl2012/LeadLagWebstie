   QUOTE(Alpha2 &#064; Jan 19 2009, 12:16 PM)        Again for many people in the US, Bank Transfers are not something people do on a regular bassis for a simple purchase, it's unfamiliar and people just want the convience of the CC order (and by association the security) rather than having to perform an action they're unfamiliar with.     Indeed, I really wish people would stop implying that we're accusing craig or other the devs of fraud. In the US, we don't have the kind of regulatory protection that they do in many other parts of the developed world, and topping that with the cross borderness of it, there's any  number of ways that it could go wrong without malfeasance on the part of Craig.  It is also a byproduct of when organizations in the EU get sued in the US, don't show up, don't pay either. I'm not sure I have a whole lot of confidence in my ability to get satisfaction if I really have to with a foreign based bank. We don't get to call our regulators to complain about the way that something gets handled in another country.  I'll be paying in either cash or CC, I'd consider paypal, but that's already gone wonky, and I'm not really aware of anything else that I'm really able to trust.  Edit: And I'm not sure that it's really wise to sort based upon payment method. Ultimately you do get 30 days, and even then you don't have to be within the window, just expect to be. And the amount of time that it's going to take to put the items together is going to be somewhat less than 30 days anyways once the parts are available. At this point not having seen Craig or anybody official say that they're not going to be able to finish enough of the units to get it done, I'd put this to speculation.
