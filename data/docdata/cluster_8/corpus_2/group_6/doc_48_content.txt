      Well if we want to blame Bush for the economy the last 8 years entirely why are we not able to blame Clinton for legislation passed and signed under his watch as well?        Bad loans on their own most certainly could have caused the market to crash on their own, but as you pointed out they had help. So many banks were making these bad loans, they were in a very risky position. The economy shifted a bit and wham, people could not pay their mortgages. It doesnt matter if the loan is held by the originating bank or bundled in a security, no money coming in is no money coming in...        I know we have gone through what Gramm did but I found this quote interesting on the wiki entry for the act:        "Also prior to the passage of the Act, there were many relaxations to the Glass-Steagall Act. For example, a few years earlier, commercial Banks were allowed to get into investment banking, and before that banks were also allowed to get into stock and insurance brokerage. Insurance underwriting was the only main operation they weren't allowed to do, something rarely done by banks even after the passage of the Act."         and Clinton's response to criticism of the act:        "I don't see that signing that bill had anything to do with the current crisis. Indeed, one of the things that has helped stabilize the current situation as much as it has is the purchase of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America, which was much smoother than it would have been if I hadn't signed that bill ... On the Glass-Steagall thing, like I said, if you could demonstrate to me that it was a mistake, I'd be glad to look at the evidence."         Clinton signed the law and the fallout should be on his shoulders as much as Gramm's.
