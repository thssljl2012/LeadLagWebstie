Both opened as a new customer and funded with a Citi Aadvantage card.                      I have opened quite a few Citi accounts over the past two years, and each application has resulted in an inquiry to my EXP report. Friends who partake in this deal also report "hard pulls" for every application. Either Citi changed their policies very recently, or you have been exceptionally lucky.
