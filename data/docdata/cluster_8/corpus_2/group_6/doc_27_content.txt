Credit cards are icky.  I have one that has a 50K limit and 20% interest.  Wha?  Who puts 50K on their credit card?  I don't have any credit card debt at all now and while it's tempting to put myself into financial difficulty and diress by buying things I can't afford, the only time I use it, is when I have cash on hand to immediately pay the credit card bill.  Keeps my credit score near 800.     That is one thing that you can use credit cards for.
