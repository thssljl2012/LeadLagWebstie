   All I am saying is that GM got the bail out money with alot of stipulations and strings attached which for some inane reason were not applied to any of the financials. GM accepted the money on the basis that they will structure a sound and viable plan on how they will return to profitability and they have until March 31 to do so. Can they or will they be able to?&amp;nbsp; Time will tell and even if they do present a working plan who is to say the government will find it satisfactory?  There are too many variables in all the bail outs none of which I find very reassuring.  &amp;nbsp;    Bugs - Take a look at CITI, Citibank    &amp;nbsp;    Remember when Citibank was bailedout, just a few months ago?
