  No worries ya'll, it was all in good fun.      UPDATE: "Bad Bank" could be $2 Trillion (with a T) was 1 Trillion yesterday (Hey a trillion here a trillion there, prety soon you're taklin' real money) I forgot who orig. said that with the Billions, but hey what's little inflation      So ... bailout at $4 trillion (conservatively) I didn't even add Citibank, Indymac, the second round for BAC (Bank of America) to buy Countrywide   $20 billion more plus gaurantees.      Let's call it a nice round 5 TRILLION, divided by the forementioned 360 million men women and children inthe good olde USA and voila ...      $13,888 per person ...  $13,888 !!!  Our Government is spending $55,555 per family of 4 for what ? A BAD BANK ... It's actually funny.   And that's without debt service (read: interest)       The "toxic assets" they are buying are non performing loans ... (read: $500,000 mortgage on a house now worth $200,000, that the owner has walked away from and it's been sold at forclosure for $125,000 ... great investment) Throw in car loans, student loans, credit cards and ...oh ya ... commercial loans) That giant flushing sound is your tax going down the drain.      You want to know the REALLY scarey thing ... The looming medicare and Medicaid, social security 500 lb gorillas in the room will make this look not so bad by comparison ...       Can you say American peso
