     anecdotally i switched to HSBC from Citibank because id finally had enough and HSBC issues me a Visa card with a 5000 USD limit.      I was like "what am I going to do with this?"  -  they were serious that EVERYONE has to have a card for 3 months before they will consider a different credit limit.      Now I'm sure with some bitching I could have sorted it but i hadnt asked for the card in the first place so I shitcanned it (then again maybe not) but that is in stark contrast to how banks operated before.
