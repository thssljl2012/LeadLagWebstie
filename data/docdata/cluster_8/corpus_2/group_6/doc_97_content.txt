I'd say that with the CBA certificate from BAI that you most certainly can market yourself to many banks looking for an auditor.    I would suggest 2 things: 1.  Contact a headhunter 2.  Also think of branching out - look to an external audit firm in addition to looking at banks.  I was hired here 8 years ago with limited banking experience and degrees in Finance and Accounting.  But that was at a time when unemployement was much lower and jobs seemed more available.  You have taken good steps to make yourself stand out from a crowd.   I myself have my CCBCO (Certified Community Bank Compliance Officer) certificate, and would like more information on the Certified Bank Auditor certificate that you have.
