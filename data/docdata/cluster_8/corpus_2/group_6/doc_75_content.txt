If you have access to multiple email addresses, for instance Gmail, which gives you invites. You can send invites to yourself, create a new email address, register for a new account on half.com with correct mailing address and new email address.       Send your new email address a half.com code, then use it and pay for your selection with a virtual credit card. Paypal and Citibank are 2 I know of that offer virtual one time credit cards. After the purchase you should get an existing member code sent to your main address to use.      Maybe I should try it to see it that would work.                           *chuckle, believe me it does work
