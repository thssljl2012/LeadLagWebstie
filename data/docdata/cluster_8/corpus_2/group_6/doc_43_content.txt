Bush only slowed down the depression by lowering the intra banking interest ratesfor a long period of time. Just wait til the large losses occur in the BANKING INSTITUTIONS WHEN THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES START TO BE FORECLOSED ON. Why do you thing the AUTO MOTIVE INDUSTRY WAS NEEDED TO BE BAILED OUT. to delay the failure of commercial property,including you local store malls. Its coming soon to your nearest mall.     What you mean slowing down? he bankrupt this whole country and it's taking away from the tax payers to bail them out. You don't see small companies getting bailed out when a large mall takes over their small town. The lost of manufacturing full time jobs for part time jobs that are crippling small cities, schools and the lost of hospitals, over crowding jails, closing military bases, including the lack of medical care. We are dam lucky we still have something to fall back onto. The tax payers shouldn't have to bail out these companies, it's not the tax payers fault when they loose their job and can't by a car, it's not the tax payers fault they loose their schools for lack of funding, it's not the tax payers fault they can't afford insurance while working a part time job and the company can't afford a policy to help. Yea! your right we're in a depression and left it all on Obama shoulders, bet bush knew about that too?
