Some of you people are missing the whole point. THEY ARE BROKE! They should not be spending ANY money on luxuries. One of the first things they should have done when they realized they needed a bailout, BEFORE they even asked for the bailout, is cancel any extravagant spending. They can start using commercial airlines! They are lucky they are even still in business.
