  Replying to:  i hate national city o/t     We use Capital One (started as Trustcompany Bank, then was bought by North Fork Bank, then bought by Capital One last year) and Bank of America.  We've never had any real problems with either.  I use my Capital One debit a lot but not so much BOA (we use that account for mortgage, property taxes, etc).  Good luck!
