Bank of America just jacked a business card of mine from a reasonable 8.99% to 27.99% because a payment was a day late (christmas date we screwed up) - after they refused to reconsider I paid it off and cut it up.  In my experience they are unreasonable jerks.  Not that I was accustomed to keeping a balance on the card, but I hate being yanked around.  If you have options and decent credit, there is no NEED to take their BS.                      wyb has it right. They don't assess a "fee," they just rape you on the interest rate if you look at them the wrong way.       I have an automatic payment set up so that even if I forget, I am never late on the minimum payment at least. They can have that 7.9% rate back when they pry it from my cold dead hands.
