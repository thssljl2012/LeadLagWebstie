Federal regulation of insurance?  Why in the world should we let the a bunch of out-of-touch senators/representatives, from both parties, who created the likes of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, regulate insurance companies, simply because one big one, AIG, assumed room temperature?  The only reason AIG needed the bailout to begin with was because of the mess congress created with the Fannie and Freddie show. Congress isn&amp;#039;t the cure, IT&amp;#039;S THE PROBLEM!!!
