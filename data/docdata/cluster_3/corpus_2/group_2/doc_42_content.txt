LONDON (Reuters) -   Bank of America  ( BAC .N), Barclays  (BARC.L) and  Goldman Sachs  ( GS .N) are expected to agree a deal  as early as Sunday to buy stricken U.S.  investment bank   Lehman  Brothers  ( LEH .N),  Britain&amp;#039;s Sunday Express  reported.        The newspaper, without citing sources, said Bank of America  would acquire the bulk of  Lehman Brothers , including its  mortgage assets.       Barclays , Britain&amp;#039;s third-biggest bank, would take a  smaller parcel including Lehman&amp;#039;s asset management and fixed  income businesses, while Goldman would take the rest, it said.      Barclays declined to comment. Goldman, Bank of America and  Lehman Brothers could not immediately be reached.      The  Sunday Express  said the success of the plan depended on  U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson hammering out a deal to  get funding from wall Street&amp;#039;s  financial institutions .      Lehman has written down billions of dollars in assets in  the last year, largely holdings of complex  mortgage-backed  securities , and over the last several months, it has been  battling rumors of defecting clients and talk of a discounted  takeover, leading to steep falls in its share price last week.
