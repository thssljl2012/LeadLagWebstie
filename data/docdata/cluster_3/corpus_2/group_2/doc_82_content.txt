           Advertisements [ ? ]                         Biden Says McCain &amp;#039;Hasn&amp;#039;t Learned Anything&amp;#039; From Economic Woes September 20, 2008 4:09 PM  ABC News Matthew Jaffe reports: Joe Biden Saturday warned that a McCain presidency could lead to the same de-regulation in the healthcare industry that the Democratic vice-presidential nominee cites as the reason for the nation&amp;#039;s current economic problems.  Addressing the United Mine Workers of America&amp;#039;s annual fish fry in Castlewood, Virginia, Biden today noted a McCain column in the September/October issue of &amp;quot;Contingencies,&amp;quot; the magazine of the American Academy of Actuaries.  &amp;quot;You saw the meltdown going on on Wall Street,&amp;quot; Biden said in his speech here in the mountains of southwestern Virginia. &amp;quot;You see the whole world worried about what&amp;#039;s going on in terms of the economy. You also saw that John McCain now says that he wants to change it. But here&amp;#039;s what John McCain wrote in a publication that came out a couple days ago. He wants to do for health care what he did for the banks.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Here&amp;#039;s what he says, I&amp;#039;m quoting. Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done the last decade for banking, would prove -- and provide more choices for innovative products and less burden by the worst of the excessive state regulations.&amp;quot; Translated: get rid of the regulations, get rid of the protection, and hang on to your health insurance. Ladies and gentlemen, this guy&amp;#039;s not learned anything.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;He wants the health care industry to have new &amp;#039;innovative&amp;#039; products. Let me translate that for you: in the mortgage industry, they talked about new innovative products  products: subprime mortgages. Without anybody looking over anybody&amp;#039;s shoulder. All these new fancy business terms about new product. The new product is bringing down our economy, bringing down the world economy.&amp;quot;  Continuing to highlight McCain&amp;#039;s column, Biden spokesman David Wade said, &amp;quot;Apparently, if this is what John McCain wants to do to health care, he may need to go to the ER to have the doctor remove his foot from his mouth.&amp;quot;   http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/09/abc-new...                         ...
