            Quote from: waronyou on September 14, 2008, 01:05:52 AM   The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Fortune all lead with Lehman Brothers&amp;amp;#039; plight this morning. &amp;amp;quot;Lehman races to find a buyer,&amp;amp;quot; screams the WSJ headline after a disastrous day during which the once high-flying investment bank&amp;amp;#039;s &amp;amp;quot;self-made survival strategyranging from spinning off commercial real-estate to selling a stake in Lehman&amp;amp;#039;s lucrative investment-management divisionfailed to halt a slide in Lehman&amp;amp;#039;s stock price.&amp;amp;quot; By the end of yesterday, Lehman&amp;amp;#039;s shares had slid 41 percent as investors voted with their feet. Lehman&amp;amp;#039;s best hope now is an outside buyer: Bank of America and Barclays are interested but only if the U.S. government offers assurances to help shield them from further losses. The Washington Post says that the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department are &amp;amp;quot;actively helping&amp;amp;quot; Lehman put itself up for sale, but time is running out; long-time Lehman customers tell Fortune that &amp;amp;quot;they have sharply curtailed their trading with the firm.&amp;amp;quot; It all seemed so different just one year ago. Back then CEO Dick Fuld (who recently received a $40 million compensation package) said, &amp;amp;quot;Do we have some stuff on the books that would be tough to get rid of? Yes. Is it going to kill us? Of course not.&amp;amp;quot; Those words could yet come back to haunt him.  http://waronyou.com/2008/09/banking-is-tanking/    If the U.S. Treasury guarentees any assistance in finances it is the SAME thing as a bailout and will lead to the bank being even more reckless than before.
