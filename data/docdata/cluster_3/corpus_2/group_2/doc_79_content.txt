  Lehman: Barclays walks       Robert Peston       14 Sep 08, 06:11 PM    I have learned that Barclays has pulled out of negotiations to buy most of the troubled investment bank, Lehman Brothers.  It&amp;#039;s decision, which was described by an executive close to the negotiations as &amp;quot;pretty definitive and unlikely to change&amp;quot;, is a setback for attempts to rescue Lehman, which are being coordinated by the US Treasury and the New York Federal Reserve.  Barclays has walked away because it was unable to obtain guarantees - from either the Treasury/Fed or other commercial organisations involved in the rescue attempt - in relation to financial commitments faced by Lehman when markets open tomorow.  &amp;quot;It was impossible to find a solution to the problem of Lehman&amp;#039;s immediate financial obligations in the time available,&amp;quot; said the executive.  These obligations, on outstanding transactions by Lehman, run to billions of dollars and would be difficult to finance at the best of times, But in the light of the credit crunch and the parlous state of financial markets, Barclays feels it would be running a crazy risk if it took these on without any protect right now.    http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/2008/09/lehman_barclays_walks.html
