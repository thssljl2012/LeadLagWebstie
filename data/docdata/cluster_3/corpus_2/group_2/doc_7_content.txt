           Let&amp;#039;s look at McCain&amp;#039;s view on what we should do about healthcare, from his article,   Better Health Care at Lower Cost for Every American  , in the Sept./Oct. issue of   Contingencies  , the magazine of the American Academy of Actuaries: Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition,  as we have done over the last decade in banking , would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation. Of course, starting yesterday, McCain is all for more regulating of banks but as anyone can see from this month&amp;#039;s issue of Contingencies, he was espousing the benefits of deregulating banking. What a farce this guy is.
