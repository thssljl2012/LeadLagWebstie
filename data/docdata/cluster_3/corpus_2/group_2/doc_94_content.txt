 I quote!       &amp;quot;Paul Krugman of the New York Times posted an entry on his blog Friday night about an article John McCain recently published on health care reform in a magazine put out by the American Academy of Actuaries. Given what happened to the US economy last week, Krugman observed that McCain&amp;#039;s remedy for health care now looks all the more problematic:       Here&amp;#039;s what McCain has to say about the wonders of market-based health reform:          &amp;quot;Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.&amp;quot;      So McCain, who now poses as the scourge of Wall Street, was praising financial deregulation like 10 seconds ago -- and promising that if we marketize health care, it will perform as well as the financial industry.&amp;quot;
