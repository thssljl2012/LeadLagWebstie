John McCain embraced legislation to broadly deregulate the banking and insurance industries, helping to sweep aside a thicket of rules established over decades in favor of a less restricted financial marketplace that proponents said would result in greater economic growth.     Now, as the Bush administration scrambles to prevent the collapse of the American International Group (AIG), the nation&amp;#039;s largest insurance company, and stabilize a tumultuous Wall Street, the Republican presidential nominee is scrambling to recast himself as a champion of regulation to end &amp;amp;quot;reckless conduct, corruption and unbridled greed&amp;amp;quot; on Wall Street......    .............n 2002, McCain introduced a bill to deregulate the broadband Internet market, warning that &amp;amp;quot;the potential for government interference with market forces is not limited to federal regulation.&amp;amp;quot; Three years earlier, McCain had joined with other Republicans to push through landmark legislation sponsored by then-Sen. Phil Gramm (Tex.), who is now an economic adviser to his campaign.
