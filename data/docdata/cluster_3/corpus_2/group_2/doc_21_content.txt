 Ha. Well I don&amp;#039;t really know that much about finance :) It&amp;#039;s just a passing knowledge.    Anyway, to try to answer your questions:      Question 1 - Who determines the price of stocks within investment banks?      Not really sure your question. Stocks, shares in companies, are traded on the open market, so it&amp;#039;s just supply/demand. If a lot of people are selling, price goes downs. If a lot of people are buying, price goes up. Of course, there&amp;#039;s different things that make people want to either buy or sell a particular stock. Like how much profit that company is making; their future plans and outlook; any debts they may have; whether the industry as a whole is seen as a good investment.    So if you&amp;#039;re asking why Lehman Brothers, Myrril Lynch, AIG, etc. took all these hits. Basically their assets started going down in value. (which were in some way or another tied to housing prices/mortgages) As house prices went down and people defaulted more on mortages, those assets went down in price. So naturally as their assets become worth less and less, the stocks of these companies went lower and lower.     But more than that, these are really -really- big institutions. These are not little start-ups. Lehman Brothers has been around for over 100 years, and when it went under, was the largest bankruptcy in US history. AIG is the largest insurance company in the world. Merril Lynch is one of the oldest and largest investment companies. When companies of *this* scope start failing, investors don&amp;#039;t shrug it off as just another company that couldn&amp;#039;t cut it. It really, really worries them that there&amp;#039;s instability and serious problems in the whole economy. Which means that now instead of just Lehman Brothers, Merril, and AIG going down in price... investors are selling  everything . This is how stock markets crash. Because everyone loses confidence in stocks as a whole, and decides to take all their money out at once.     We were seriously headed for a stock market crash. That&amp;#039;s why the government got involved bailing these companies out.       Question 3 - Any theories on how foreign markets might fare thanks to this?      A lot of overseas companies do business in or with the US. Or they have assets tied in the US economy. Basically, if bad things happen to us it&amp;#039;s going to have a negative impact on everyone. Although that impact is more moderate since it doesn&amp;#039;t directly affect them; but it still affects them.      Question 4 - Is there a possibility that over-regulation from the Treasury might occur (like back in Hoover&amp;#039;s day) and cause depressive consequences?      Possible but unlikely. This is kinda the problem with taking preventative action. When you do things after the fact, nobody questions that something should&amp;#039;ve been done   But when you try to stop something bad from happening; people are going to second guess you whether something&amp;#039;s necessary.    The guys in charge of the Treasury and Fed are very smart. They are not doing this because they think things will get bad. Or because they&amp;#039;re worried about keeping their jobs. They&amp;#039;re doing this because they honestly, honestly believe we&amp;#039;re on the edge of another depression. Although that&amp;#039;s kinda dire; it&amp;#039;s more accurate to say we&amp;#039;re on the edge of an extended recession. Think the 1970&amp;#039;s or Japan recently. With the housing market being bad; with energy and food costs up; with high unemployement... on top of that, add a stock market crash, and high interest rates. I mean, things get much worse. They&amp;#039;re trying to stop that. Is there a risk they&amp;#039;ll overcorrect? Possibly. But it&amp;#039;s not irreversible. They can, and probably will, just disband any regulation that isn&amp;#039;t working.       I&amp;#039;m like a good haines t-shirt: tagless
