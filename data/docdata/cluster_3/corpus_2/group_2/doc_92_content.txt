       Over a year ago:   Troubled Bear Stearns fund bailed out with $3.2bn loan  By Stephen Foley in New York Saturday, 23 June 2007  Bear Stearns has agreed an emergency $3.2bn (1.6bn) loan to shore up a hedge fund whose failed investments in the US sub-prime mortgage market have triggered a financial crisis on Wall Street.  The loan is aimed at staving off the fund&amp;#039;s collapse and a wave of losses that could spread to hundreds more hedge funds, banks and other investment vehicles.  Two Bear Stearns-run hedge funds have been listing badly for several weeks and some of their creditors - who include Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan and Barclays - had threatened to seize and sell assets that they held as collateral for billions of dollars in loans.   It has become clear that such a fire sale would yield meagre returns, even if enough buyers could be found for the toxic investments. These investments are called collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), financial instruments created and sold by Wall Street banks who package together and then carve up large numbers of sub-prime mortgages and other loans.  Now that the homeowners who took out the underlying mortgages are defaulting in record numbers, the value of the CDO has declined sharply - but Wall Street is still struggling to work out by how much.  A fire sale of CDOs would crystallise billions of dollars of losses across a CDO market that is worth over $1 trillion and grew by $489bn last year.  The possibility has terrified Wall Street because it is unknown exactly where the ownership of CDOs might be concentrated. Many hedge funds own parcels of CDOs, as do the trading desks of most of the big investment banking firms, but their ownership has also been spreading in the past two years to include mutual funds, pension funds and universities.   Bear Stearns was pushing the view yesterday that CDO values are actually artificially depressed because of the crisis at its two funds, but other investors - particularly hedge funds who have been betting on a fall in CDO values - have warned that the market may be being artificially propped up. A group of hedge funds led by Paulson &amp;amp;amp; Co asked the Securities &amp;amp;amp; Exchange Commission last week to examine whether banks were doing deals to buy back CDOs at values above the market price so as not to have to admit that other CDOs in their portfolio had gone down in value.   When Merrill Lynch tried to auction assets seized from the Bear Stearns funds earlier this week, some attracted bids of just 30 per cent of their face value and Merrill declined to sell. Instead, it will now aim to deal directly with Bear Stearns, and the $3.2bn cash injection yesterday makes it likely that it will get more of its loans repaid. Barclays, which is understood to have lent about $300m to the funds, has always been in favour of a negotiated settlement rather than a fire sale.  Sam Molinaro, Bear Stearns chief financial officer, said direct deals between Bear Stearns and the funds&amp;#039; creditors would allow all parties to &amp;amp;quot;relieve the pressure and give investors a good chance to evaluate the values&amp;amp;quot; of CDOs. He said the new loan was being made on economic terms and it was confident that when the CDO market stabilised the fund would be able to repay the parent company.  Concerns over potential hidden losses was one reason for a slump on the equity market yesterday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 185.6 points, or nearly 1.4 per cent, to 13,360.3.  =============  From March of 2007  &amp;amp;quot;Henry Paulson Jr., the U.S. Treasury secretary, said Tuesday that the global economy was as strong as he had ever seen it and that changes in China would help lessen the kind of market volatility that has recently rocked stock markets.&amp;amp;quot;  ============= From September 15, 2008  &amp;amp;quot;White House says no more bailouts on the way In separate addresses, Bush, Paulson say economy is fundamentally sound...  WASHINGTON - The Bush administration signaled strongly on Monday that troubled Wall Street shouldnt expect more rescues from Washington.&amp;amp;quot;   ================== Confident yet?
