    LC (the REAL Laureen):   AIG isn&amp;#039;t a bank. ......It is an insurance company. There stocks and mutual funds dropped in value and they were then overextended. Again...thats the risk they take and thats the risk people take when they invest their money in stocks and mutual funds. Sorry but..... too bad. What exactly were they doing with everyones money is the question I want answered.   aig is a financial institution, like banks are  have you ever taken an economics class?
