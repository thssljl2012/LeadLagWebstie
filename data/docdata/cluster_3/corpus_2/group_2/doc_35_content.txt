       Geode, I don&amp;#039;t know where you pulled these articles, was it some worker blog or what?  these people dont know what they are talking about.  What they are doing is taking the employment contracts that these guys have on file and assuming that executives will get a severance package customary when a company is sold, even though the company fails.  I don&amp;#039;t think thats the case, and in bankruptcy court all that becomes null and void.    If the democrats are going to become some angry worker party that can&amp;#039;t understand business, as they were in the 70s and early 80s then that won&amp;#039;t work any more than it worked then, when stupid employment contracts for machinists etc. drove companies like Braniff under.  You&amp;#039;ve been trying to convince me that the US won&amp;#039;t make money on this bailout deal, I think its really just an anti-business bias with you that reminds me of the old democratic party.  If you want to go after excessive compensation start with sports, there are players who cost millions and get injured and don&amp;#039;t deliver, then actors, then TV production people like Bruckheimer.  sheesh.  Baseball players make 35mm per year.   Nomura offers cash bonuses to Lehman staff  By Peter Thal Larsen and Lina Saigol  Published: September 26 2008 03:00   Last updated: September 26 2008 03:00  Lehman Brothers&amp;#039; top investment bankers in London have been offered large guaranteed cash bonuses by Nomura, the Japanese lender that this week bought the European and Asian operations of the bankrupt Wall Street bank.   Nomura has offered to pay Lehman investment bankers the equivalent of last year&amp;#039;s bonus, in cash, if they stay until the autumn of 2009. It has also promised that the 2009 bonus pool will be the same size as last year, though a proportion will be in the form of restricted stock.   News of the cash bonuses - part of a $1bn (544m) pot Nomura has set aside to keep Lehman staff - comes at a time when compensation in the City is under intense scrutiny from politicians and regulators.  Gordon Brown has called for an overhaul of investment banking bonuses. The Financial Services Authority has threatened to impose additional capital charges on banks that do not adopt longer-term bonus structures.   The Nomura pledge contrasts with the mood at many rival investment banks, which are cutting bonuses and firing staff as a result of the markets slump.  Even during the boom, cash bonuses were increasingly rare as investment banks paid staff in restricted shares in an effort to tie them in. Nomura has structured its deal so that the 2008 cash bonus will be divided into two tranches, with the first paid in spring 2009 and the second in the autumn.   &amp;amp;quot;I think it&amp;#039;s attractive,&amp;amp;quot; one banker familiar with the offer said yesterday. &amp;amp;quot;Most people will be inclined to take it.&amp;amp;quot;  Nomura, which declined to comment, this week bought Lehman&amp;#039;s European equities and investment banking operations for an undisclosed sum. It is taking on about 2,500 former Lehman staff, though bankers said about 700 are expected to leave as a result of the integration. The people who leave are expected to receive full redundancy packages.  The bonus offer was negotiated by a group of Lehman&amp;#039;s top bankers in an effort to ensure that the benefits of the takeover were shared by the entire staff.  The negotiations came after Lehman&amp;#039;s US operations were sold to Barclays Capital.  PPF premium, Page 24  http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ea48c03a-8b62-11dd-b634-0000779fd18c.html
