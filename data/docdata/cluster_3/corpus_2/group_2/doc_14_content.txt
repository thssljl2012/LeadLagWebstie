      The crux of the matter is the losses suffered by insurance companies (read AIG) in the PMI arena.  If you don&amp;#039;t know, PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance) is a requirement for all of these subprime loans.  The borrower pays the premium when using less than a 20% equity position  in the purchase of a home.        After 9/11, we should have shot the hostage.  Oil.  We could have made the Middle East irrelevant by putting the war chest into alternatives to oil rather than the empire building we are currently conducting.        All right, too late on that front.  But the same principle applies.        Shoot the hostage.        The economy is being held hostage by decreasing home values.  Let the US Government take over PMI.  Call it US Mortgage Insurance.  Lets deal with the root cause of the problem and let the financial markets take care of themselves.  After all, Paulson will again be a private citizen in charge of Goldman Sachs soon and will as such reap the gigantic windfall he himself engineered.        And we will be on the hook for much less than the 700B currently being thrown around an have a solution to boot.
