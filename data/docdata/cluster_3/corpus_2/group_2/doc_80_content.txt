 The government couldn&amp;#039;t find a buyer for Lehman Bros. over the weekend. The 2 primary buyer candidates, Bank of America and Barclays, walked out of the negotiations. Now it appears that Lehman Bros. will go bankrupt and ALL SHAREHOLDERS WILL LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT! This will send huge ripples throughout the financials tomorrow. Look for a 10-15% share price loss in all the major banks when the market opens. Lehman Bros. has 25k employees worldwide. 12K of those employees are based in Manhattan. This is just another fallen domino. Next in line? Washington Mutual Bank, AIG, and then Wachovia. Remember that economic depression your grandparents told you about? Get ready. You&amp;#039;re about to get your own personal taste of one. THANKS GEORGE BUSH!!!! YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!!!!
