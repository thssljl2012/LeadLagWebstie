 Peers balk at bailout  NYTimes: Federal Reserve May Act Alone in Rescuing A.I.G.         Quote:                          September 16, 2008, 5:24 pm       The fate of the American International Group now lies with Federal Reserve, as the likelihood of a $75 billion credit line financed by a bank syndicate appears remote, people briefed on the matter said Tuesday afternoon.      It is not known whether the Fed would now change course and agree to provide an emergency infusion of capital to the cash-starved insurance giant, or what form such aid would take. If the Fed decides not to intervene, A.I.G. will likely file for bankruptcy by Wednesday, these people said.      In an intense discussion at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Fed and a group of executives from JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and other firms agreed that a banking syndicate to provide the $75 billion in emergency financing could not be arranged by Tuesday night.      If the Fed intervenes, it would be an eleventh-hour bailout of A.I.G., whose debt downgrades by major credit ratings agencies could have sparked a debilitating need for additional capital.      Concerns about A.I.G.s health have gripped the financial markets, as many investors feared the insurance giant would follow Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy. An A.I.G. collapse could prove an even bigger systemic threat to major financial firms than Lehmans downfall, because of the companys dominant position in insuring mortgage-linked securities. Should A.I.G. fail, it could kick off a wave of additional write-downs at banks already staggering from the credit crunch.      Kenneth Lewis, the chief executive of Bank of America, told CNBC on Monday that virtually every Wall Street giant would be touched by an A.I.G. failure. (In a surprise commingling of financial crises, the landlord of Lehmans London office said the banks rent payments were insured by A.I.G.)      Gov. David A. Paterson of New York, whose insurance department supervises A.I.G., on Monday allowed the company to borrow $20 billion from its subsidiaries, and urged the Fed to relent and offer financial aid. Mr. Paterson told CNBC Tuesday morning that the company could survive only one day without the financing.      Andrew M. Cuomo, New Yorks attorney general, on Tuesday also urged the Fed to help, arguing that it was too connected with major banks to be allowed to fail.      But other top politicians, including Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the top-ranked Republican in the Senate Banking Committee, and Senator John McCain, the Republic presidential candidate, have both expressed opposition to federal help for A.I.G.      The magnitude of a potential A.I.G. collapse compelled a group of top banking executives to huddle at the New York Fed last weekend. Throughout the discussions, however, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. insisted that no taxpayer money be used to rescue the insurer. The federal government has already brokered the sale of Bear Stearns and the rescue of the mortgage financing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.      A.I.G.s collapse seemed so imminent on Tuesday that the company hired the law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp;amp;amp; Manges  which is also handling the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy  to draw up bankruptcy papers.   Many of A.I.G.s subsidiaries have drawn down on their credit lines, people briefed on the matter said.      Shares in A.I.G. rebounded sharply after speculation arose that the Fed had changed its mind, closing at $3.75 on Tuesday. They had fallen more than 60 percent earlier in the day, and have plummeted nearly 94 percent over the past 12 months.                     Rumors were running wild all over Wall Street today - AIG swung from just over $1 at the open today to over $5 intraday, on nothing but bailout speculation. WaMu shares rose sharply on [apparently completely bogus] rumors that JP Morgan was in talks with WM about a possible acquisition. Interestingly, because both of these rumors served to pump up the respective stock prices, one heard no loud proclamations from the SEC&amp;#039;s Chris &amp;amp;quot;Tool of Wall Street&amp;amp;quot; Cox about &amp;amp;quot;cracking down on rumormongering&amp;amp;quot;.      Note that unlike with the government-sponsored GSEs, the &amp;amp;quot;middle way&amp;amp;quot; of a conservatorship is  not an option with an entirely private insurance firm like AIG :        Quote:                         WASHINGTON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - A U.S. government source said on Tuesday that no federal agency has legal authority to place troubled insurance company American International Group Inc (AIG) under conservatorship.      Late on Tuesday, Bloomberg News reported that one option of U.S. authorities was to put AIG under control of a conservator, as the government did earlier with mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.      Insurance companies, however, are typically regulated by states, not by federal agencies, so legal authority to put AIG under conservatorship doesn&amp;#039;t rest with federal authorities, the source said.
