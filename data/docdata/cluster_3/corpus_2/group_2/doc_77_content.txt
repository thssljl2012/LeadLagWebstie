This rescue ***** has got to STOP!!   Millionaire CEOs and CFOs made these decisions (backed by their Millionaire Board of Directors). And now that their GREED has become a corporate cancer eating these STUPID companies alive - our paychecks are supposed to bail their sorry asses out?  Hell no - let them go under!!   We are sick and tired of all the doomsday warnings from these greedy and stupid bastards about financial meltdown that will result if we let them go under. WE are melting down NOW as a result of one bailout after another. This ***** has to STOP!  The markets will have to absorb it. If blood on the trading floors has to happen - so be it. Wallstreet will have to mop it up - not mainstreet.  Latest NYT update from this afternoon - NO PUBLIC MONEY &amp;quot;Both Barclays and Bank of America expressed interest in buying Lehman and were negotiating hard, initially insisting that the government provide financial support. But federal officials were adamant that no public money be used  a big point of contention because many of the top Wall Street executives believe that their banks, which have each written down tens of billions of dollars in assets, do not have the capacity to lead the rescue on their own.&amp;quot;
