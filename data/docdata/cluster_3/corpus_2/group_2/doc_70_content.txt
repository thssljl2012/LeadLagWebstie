BofA was able to acquire Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase was able to acquire Bear Stearns  only because of  the repeal of Glass Steagall.      AIG is an insurance company, not an investment bank.     Glass-Steagall was a depression-era anachronism.                      I&amp;#039;d heard Glass-Steagall was a dinosaur, a reason to get rid  of  it.
