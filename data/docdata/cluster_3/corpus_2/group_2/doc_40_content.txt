 Sorry, but these things would not have been allowed under Glass-Steagall....which Clinton signed into law in 1999. Yes, it was sponsered by Phil Graham, but there was no majority and clinton didn&amp;#039;t veto. So the blame is shared.     This repeal allowed commercial lenders to underwrite and trade instruments such as  mortgage-backed securities........       Without this, these companies would not be involved in the mortgage mess       There were many warnings that this would happen back in 1999 when the repeal was done. If you Google, you&amp;#039;ll see article after article from 10 years ago saying this is exactly what would happen, and that it would even affect the Insurance industry- AIG for example.
