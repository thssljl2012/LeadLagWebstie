The aftershocks of the earthquake that toppled the 158-year-old Lehman Brothers investment bank, Merrill Lynch and the AIG insurance giant  all within a 24-hour span  shook capitalist markets around the globe.   At one time in capitalist development, financiers greased the wheels of industry, turning out real goods, infrastructure and services.   But in the era of deindustrialization, mega-mergers, deregulation and privatization of public institutions, the industry that finance capital greased  in its global search for the highest rates of profit  was a house of cards built on subprime loans, speculation and other financial devices. A rickety, greed-based structure that created nothing of use.   This led not only to the biggest financial crisis in U.S. history, but also to the largest global income gap in history with a few at the top enjoying trillions while 95 percent of us struggle.   Today 3 billion people in the world live on less than $2 per day. In the U.S., workers are earning less and have a declining standard of living even though they are more productive than ever. The average U.S. household is $9,000 in debt.   The government is injecting billions to bail out failed financial companies. Dont the nations communities and working families deserve the same so they dont fail?   So what to do?    http://www.pww.org/article/articleview/13726/                         ...
