Glass-Steagall, you may or may not recall, effectively locked commercial banks and investment banks out of each others&amp;#039; businesses. It was felt at the time the law passed, that the Great Crash was exacerbated because commercial banks had been allowed to underwrite securities and had therefore exposed depositors to stock market risk.....(to the extent that their deposits disappear if the bank saw heavy losses from its exposure to the stock market). Repealing the act, shortly after Citicorp and Travelers announced their merger in the late 90s, allowed investment banks and commercial banks to combine their businesses. Citigroup can at once take depositors&amp;#039; money while at the same time exposing its balance sheet to immense risks through vehicles like SIVs. The idea that commercial banks should principally be concerned with protecting depositors&amp;#039; capital seemed quaint in the late 90s I guess.                      1. No one should reply to ITN. He&amp;#039;s a troll.        2. The above is a red herring and partially incorrect.  First, Glass Steagal hasn&amp;#039;t caused ANY of this.  The failing institutions are primarily iBanks that stayed iBanks.  They&amp;#039;re not deposit taking institutions.      3. No one has yet been able to show just how the repeal of Glass Steagal actually caused any of this.      4. SIVs are off balance sheet and are not recourse to banks.  They do not expose banks&amp;#039; balance sheets to risk.  To the extent that certain banks like Citi and HSBC, among others, took them back on balance sheet, they did so because of reputational concerns, not because they had to.  Standard Chartered (Whistlejacket), IKB (Rhinebridge) and Barclays (Mainsail, which was a SIV-lite) all let the SIVs they sponsored fail and it had no recourse to depositors.
