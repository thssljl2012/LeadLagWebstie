So I&amp;#039;ve been browsing through a couple of threads and SPWN regarding the recent events in the US, one thing that does stick out is that in my opinion most of the people that have made comments in these threads -I ain&amp;#039;t going to point fingers lol-  don&amp;#039;t really got a clear idea of the inner workings of the US financial market and how it&amp;#039;s intertwined with every single aspect of stock exchanges all over the world  (and the countless banks, corporations who are tied with these financial institutes)       The complexity of the dynamics between Wall Street (Dowjones, NYSE, Nasdaq) and the other big players in the stock market indexes like; Euronext, CAC 40, Nikkei, DAX etc... is far more then most of us can even start to comprehend.      Due too the subprime mortgage crisis in the US all these  indexes  ( which are actually a good representation of how a local economy is doing ) have been affected in a severe matter, because globalization &amp;amp;amp; stock markets economies all over the world are dependent of each in such a degree that where as if one economy is doing bad the rest of the world is affected (something we have clearly seen with the steady fall of the US dollar against the Euro over the last couple of years) in other words when the sh*t hits the fan in the US this also (immediately!) affects the stock markets across the Atlantic. -companies going bankrupt &amp;amp;amp; people losing their jobs etc...-      I don&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;s that big of a deal that the FED is getting involved with what is happening in Wall Street, by saving a few of their banks the US government isn&amp;#039;t going to stop the chain of events that has been set in effect as soon as the first financial giants went down under. Even though they &amp;amp;quot;saved&amp;amp;quot; Bearn Stearns (FED &amp;amp;amp; JPMorganChase), Merrill Lynch (by Bank of America) and most recently AIG (worlds biggest insurance company) with the temporary 85 billion dollar injection. Fannie Mae &amp;amp;amp; Freddie Mac ... anyone? EXACTLY!                My 3 questions to y&amp;#039;all are:                 1. Where  is the US government going to keep finding this money to back up these desperate manouvres?                2.  How long  do you think the FED will be able too persevere and more importantly back up these measures                3. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs who&amp;#039;s next to go head over heels?
