Quote:                   TONY JONES: Well indeed, and no one can believe it seems that Lehman Brothers is gone, effectively gone. Merrill Lynch is being sold out at bargain basement prices but there&amp;#039;s more to come.       I mean one of the biggest insurance groups in America, AIG, also looks like it&amp;#039;s teetering on the brink. How much worse could it get?      DEREK SHEARER: It could get much worse, I mean no one knows. I think as we&amp;#039;ve said, we&amp;#039;ll see in the next couple of days.       As I say, though, I think we&amp;#039;ve learned from the past. Paulson is not sitting back, he was working all weekend. He&amp;#039;s been working all weekend with other bankers, doing everything he can within human possibility.        So I think that the longer question is, if it continues does it become the issue in the campaign?  Because the necessary reforms are not going to be taken by the current lame duck government, but it&amp;#039;ll be taken by the next president, whether it&amp;#039;s Obama or McCain.       Will this now be the deciding factor, how these men respond?  Two or three days ago, you wouldn&amp;#039;t have said that. It would have been what do we think of governor Palin of Alaska?         Now suddenly, she&amp;#039;s going to disappear. I think she thinks Lehman Brothers are two guys that might have visited Alaska . But, you know, now it&amp;#039;s going to have to come down to the two candidates who have to respond, and they&amp;#039;ve made statements already.                                                                                     Quote:                   DEREK SHEARER: .. we know Senator McCain has supported President Bush 90 per cent of the time. We know his economics; at least as he stated them are the same as Bush.        On the other hand, he is now marketing himself as a maverick, a reformer who&amp;#039;s sort of above party. So he&amp;#039;s going to have to prove that and he doesn&amp;#039;t really like economics, it doesn&amp;#039;t interest him, he gets confused when he talks about it.       He&amp;#039;s going to have to be much clearer about what he would do.                                             Obama by comparison ...                                              Quote:                   And I think you&amp;#039;ll have to expect Obama to be much clearer. He&amp;#039;s going to have to say what does he mean by these statements, what kind of reforms would he take?       TONY JONES: He&amp;#039;s very good at the populist rhetoric, but how good is he going to be when it comes to the nitty gritty of describing in detail how to solve this shocking financial crisis?      DEREK SHEARER: Well he has a lot of smart people supporting him.  George Soros, who I gather is going to be on your show in the next few days, in his most recent book lays out a series of reforms.        There are  a number of experts who have very specific proposals that they&amp;#039;re putting forward.  Now how do you explain some of these that are rather complicated in the middle of a presidential campaign?       And do you do it in a way that it sounds credible to people on main street, to regular voters, and do they understand what&amp;#039;s at stake here?       And we don&amp;#039;t know the answer to that.        That&amp;#039;s why it&amp;#039;s going to be incredibly interesting to see how this plays out  in the course of this election.
