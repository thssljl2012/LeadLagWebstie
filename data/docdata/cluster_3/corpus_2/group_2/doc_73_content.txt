      Actually the blame rests solely at the feet of the greedy groups that run these companies. The real estate deal that Lehman put together, where they took pieces of all parts of the capital stack, were never sustainable. THey would sell these pieces in syndicated deals and they got caught when then he trades stopped. Sheer greed will always get you in the end. _________________ Courtesy is contagious....Let&amp;#039;s start an epidemic
