&amp;gt;                             The Party&amp;#039;s Over  By Patrick J. Buchanan  19/09/08 &amp;quot;CS&amp;quot; -- - The Crash of 2008, which is now wiping out trillions of dollars of our people&amp;#039;s wealth, is, like the Crash of 1929, likely to mark the end of one era and the onset of another. The new era will see a more sober and much diminished America. The &amp;quot;Omnipower&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Indispensable Nation&amp;quot; we heard about in all the hubris and braggadocio following our Cold War victory is history.   Seizing on the crisis, the left says we are witnessing the failure of market economics, a failure of conservatism.   This is nonsense. What we are witnessing is the collapse of Gordon Gecko (&amp;quot;Greed Is Good!&amp;quot;) capitalism. What we are witnessing is what happens to a prodigal nation that ignores history, and forgets and abandons the philosophy and principles that made it great.   A true conservative cherishes prudence and believes in fiscal responsibility, balanced budgets and a self-reliant republic. He believes in saving for retirement and a rainy day, in deferred gratification, in not buying on credit what you cannot afford, in living within your means.   Is that really what got Wall Street and us into this mess
