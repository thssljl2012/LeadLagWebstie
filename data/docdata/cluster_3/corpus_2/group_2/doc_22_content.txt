Predicted: September 15th, 2008    Status: AIG -- CONFIRMED    Congress has all but capitulated to Paulson, but a small core of &amp;amp;quot;true conservatives&amp;amp;quot; has finally mustered up the balls to take on Bush, after 8 years of rubber stamping. Like Davy Crocket at the Alamo, these guys will surely go down to defeat, but their legacy will live on as heros, who took on the monster and while they didn&amp;#039;t win, they inspired others who had all but given up.
