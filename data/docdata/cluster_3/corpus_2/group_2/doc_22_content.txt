 Ok I kind of get what is going on here, so basically AIG is the ultimate in insurance for mortgages, houses and cars and whatever.    So say they can&amp;#039;t repay their debts, what happens then? A depression?    Or if some of the other big guys go down like WaMu and Morgan Stanley, does this basically mean our economy gets even worse?    Also if China buys out Morgan Stanley does this mean they would have an even more direct influence on our economy, I know they bought a lot of bonds and could sell them and really mess us up.
