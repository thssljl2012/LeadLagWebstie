And correctly stated the base of the economy is sound. It&amp;#039;s the financial markets that are hurting. True they are effecting housing and credit purchases but a sshown today the investors are returning to the market                       ....so now the economy is disconnected with the financial markets?   When did you arrive on earth? The economy is the financial markets. If they meltdown, it&amp;#039;s the end. Do you think it&amp;#039;s a coincidence that the government has been bailing out banks, insurance cos. (AIG), etc at a feverish pace because they have nothing to do with the economy? As far as Obama agreeing with Bush on Bernanke and Paulson to fix the debacle, who else is there besides them to accomplish this?? I&amp;#039;ll bet you were thinking of John McCain and Sarah Palin........ .
