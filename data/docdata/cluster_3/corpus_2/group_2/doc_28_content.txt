 I am sure most of you know by now: Barclays Cap is buying  Lehman Captial Markets and its assets. In NY 10,000 jobs will be safe atleast till Dec. After the consolidation, redundant and others will get slips.    Because of no operation money, London employees were let go. Barclays is considering LB London operations.    Merill and BoA merger will be more painful for employees. Merill banking division will be gone and few others on both side are being tagged. There will lots of job losses in the next six months there.
