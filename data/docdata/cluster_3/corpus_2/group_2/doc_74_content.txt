  U.S. TAXPAYERS ALSO ON THE HOOK FOR FOREIGN BANKS        September 21st, 2008   Sure, Hank. Tell us another one.

The legislative outline that went to Capitol Hill at   1:30 a.m. Saturday    had  said that an eligible financial institution had to have its headquarters in the United States.            But then , Treasury Fact Sheet  released at  7:15 Saturday night   sought to give the administration more flexibility, with an expanded definition that could include all of those banks: Participating financial institutions must have significant operations in the U.S.,   unless     the Secretary   makes a determination, in consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, that broader eligibility is necessary to effectively stabilize financial markets.    That could  now  include foreign-based institutions with big U.S. operations, such as Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS.       The major change in the suggested eligibility requirements is the biggest change that Treasury publicly made after a day of briefings and conversations with Capitol Hill, and is likely the first of many.
