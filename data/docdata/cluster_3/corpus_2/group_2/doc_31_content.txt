Can any of you economic intellectual giants please explain to me what you think would happen if we let these financial institutions fail?      Its so funny anytime we refer to your Demoratic leaders as Socialists you guys cry that we don&amp;amp;#039;t know what Socialism is, but now the worm has turned and you are crying socialism and you don&amp;amp;#039;t know what it means. Fannie and Freddie, their names are acronyms for Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, were always government entities, the Fed just took more control over them because the government has a broader financial wheelbase and because the US couldn&amp;amp;#039;t let millions of FHA home loans go south. Now one could argue that those are socialistic in nature, and I have long argued that they should be done away with, but its not like these are a new happenstance, these entities were started by FDR in that socialistic takeover of the country it has nothing to do with G-Dub he wasn&amp;amp;#039;t even alive then.      The Federal Reserve bank is not part of the government, its a non-governmental entity set up to do just this. So far all they have done is promised to provide AIG with money in case they need it, no money has changed hands yet. AIG is an insurance company its not like Lehman or Merrill. And in turn if AIG does take advantage of this loan the United States of America will own a portion of the company, because we will be using taxpayer money to prop them up. So in essence we, you and I, are loaning AIG money to be able to pay its obligations to you and I and we get a partial stake in it, through our representatives because we are in fact a representative democracy.       Lehman and Merrill were bought by other banks that&amp;amp;#039;s how capitalism works.
