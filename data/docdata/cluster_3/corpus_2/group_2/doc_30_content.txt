Just published in a Sept/October issue of  Contingencies , the magazine of the American Academy of Actuaries (but linked in NUMEROUS places on the web)     A quote by John McCain:   Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.    Errrr, yeah John.  Because deregulating the banks has obviously worked so well.
