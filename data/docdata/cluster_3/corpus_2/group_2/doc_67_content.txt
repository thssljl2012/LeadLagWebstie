    OUCH!       John McCain authored an article,  Better Health Care at Lower Cost for Every American,  in the Sept./Oct. issue of  Contingencies, the magazine of the American Academy of Actuaries .  You might want to be seated before reading this.     Here&amp;#039;s what McCain has to say about the wonders of market-based health reform:        Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation       So is he for or against regulation?????????? FLIP/FLOP
