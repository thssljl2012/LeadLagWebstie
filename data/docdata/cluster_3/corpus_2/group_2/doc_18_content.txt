The latest crumbling of Lehman brothers (big US financial firm, key people involved...), a consequence of the oil price hike, which after 50 years of controlling it, somehow allowed to go up fast; which (oil price) is pegged by the Americans &amp;amp;amp; Brits to the US dollar, causing prices to go up and credit terms to extend, and financial companies to say: we can no longer bear the accounts receivables, we declare bankruptcy protection.     President Bush said: &amp;amp;quot;It is an adjustment&amp;amp;quot;. Mish crisis... ! eh when you plan it, it becomes an adjustment.     There is insurance, done by AIG. Largest US insurer. They can&amp;#039;t cover it. Who is stepping in? The Federal Reserve, buying 80% of the firm. So it becomes publicly (government) controlled. From indirect control to direct control, by moneymakers.     And who is bailing out finally the Lehman group? AIG? The Federal Reserve? No. The People. They are in deeper debt. Coz the government borrows money from the fed. and pays it back from taxes. Who started this Federal reserve idea?     Bottom line, another war on (Iraq), profit made on the oil hike front by selling higher, profit on arms sold to Middle east, and money to losing friend investors paid by taxpers, the average **** &amp;amp;amp; Hariette.

Once you trickle down into its history, and connect it to our history, and retrace, you might see things, you might not like.  ...      http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7620127.stm       http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/bu...insure.html?hp       http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/09/18/bus...omy/index.html                       Yoss, from what I read the AIG bailout was actually a loan. But why do they need $85 billion. Actually the federal reserve will make AIG pay 11% interest on this loan which is very high rate for a corporation to pay. As long as the Federal Reserve Banks are carrying the loan I don&amp;#039;t really have a problem with it though so long as taxpayer dollars are not at risk.     This bailout I think it means that once again corporations are being treated more humanely by our government than it treats its own citizens.
