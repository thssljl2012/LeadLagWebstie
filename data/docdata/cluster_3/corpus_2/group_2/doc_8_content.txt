 Wow, I can&amp;#039;t say I was expecting that to happen.  I was expecting Sachs or someone to step up and loan them the money.  So far extended hours trading likes what they see as the stock is going back up.  I still wish I had unloaded it when I saw it peak at $5/share today.  Tomorrow should be another interesting day.      At what point though is the government going to finally say they&amp;#039;ve had enough.  They&amp;#039;re setting a VERY bad example here that&amp;#039;s just going to create even more reckless companies.  Nobody will fear killing their business as they&amp;#039;ll expect the government to just bail them out so they can try again.  This is getting absurd and should stop.
