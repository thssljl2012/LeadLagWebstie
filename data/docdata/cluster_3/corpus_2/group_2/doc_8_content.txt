So...McCain is on record in a new interview coming out in some actuarial publication this month as saying      [quote[Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.[/quote]      Oh man.  That&amp;#039;s gotta hurt.        I&amp;#039;m usually pretty good at guessing how stuff will be spun, but I&amp;#039;m not really coming up with much on this one.  Granted it&amp;#039;s late and I have a cold...but still.        I&amp;#039;m putting the very small amount of money we have left in our retirement account on...      &amp;amp;quot;5 years in a box&amp;amp;quot;      So, how would you spin this if you worked for McCain.
