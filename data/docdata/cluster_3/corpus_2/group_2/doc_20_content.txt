LOL. The DAX is down just as much as the others. You can bless the German banks all you like but they haven&amp;#039;t helped.      AIG is an insurance company, not a bank.      I don&amp;#039;t know what you mean by a &amp;amp;quot;firesale&amp;amp;quot;.      The DOW will probably go down about 500points today.
