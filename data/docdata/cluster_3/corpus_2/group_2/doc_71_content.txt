What We Can and Cannot Do  &amp;amp;quot;We cant feed and clothe all of Americas children, but we can afford $60 billion to bail out Bear Stearns.  We cant provide decent medical care to Americas seniors, but we can give $85 billion to AIG insurance.  We cant lift one finger to help out Americans losing their homes, but we can hand over up to $1 trillion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  We havent the funds to provide proper care and support to American veterans, but we can afford up to $600 billion to buy pledged Lehman Brothers assets.  We cant do a thing to stanch to flow of jobs offshore and alleviate the suffering of out-of-work Americans, but we can hand $700 billion over to a guy who, until two years ago, ran the main problem-creating company: Goldman Sachs.  We cant afford to properly educate our children to fit into a changing America, but we can afford $1 trillion for a war that Cheney and Bush knowingly lied us into.&amp;amp;quot;  Excerpt from Edgar J. Steele&amp;#039;s Night of the Living Debt rant
