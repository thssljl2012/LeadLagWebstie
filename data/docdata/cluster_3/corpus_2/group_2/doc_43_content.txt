          Bush rarely asks for time so that is clearly an indicator that infusion of 3/4ths of a Trillion Dollars in taxpayer money to go into failed financial market business is necessary, and quickly.   Robbing the poor to support the rich who engineered the crisis.  Robin Hood would have a fit!  The Sheriff of Nottingham would love it!!   Up to 10,000 staff at the New York office of the bankrupt investment bank Lehman Brothers will share a bonus pool set aside for them that is worth $2.5bn (1.4bn), Barclays Bank, which is buying the business, confirmed last night.  The revelation sparked fury among the workers&amp;#039; former colleagues, Lehman&amp;#039;s 5,000 staff based in London, who currently have no idea how long they will go on receiving even their basic salaries, let alone any bonus payments. It also prompted a renewed backlash over the compensation culture in global finance, with critics claiming that many bankers receive pay and rewards that bore no relation to the job they had done.  A spokesman for Barclays said the $2.5bn bonus pool in New York had been set aside before Lehman Brothers filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States a week ago. Barclays has agreed that the fund should continue to be ring-fenced now it has taken control of Lehman&amp;#039;s US business, a deal agreed by American bankruptcy courts over the weekend.    http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/fury-at-25bn...
