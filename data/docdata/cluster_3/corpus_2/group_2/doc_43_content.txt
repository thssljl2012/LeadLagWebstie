           Advertisements [ ? ]                         By Froma Harrop  &amp;quot;The fundamentals of our economy are strong,&amp;quot; John McCain said as Wall Street went into white-knuckle panic over diving investor confidence. Does he believe that? It doesn&amp;#039;t really matter, because the Republican has outsourced his economic policy to the ideologues whose opposition to regulations brought the financial markets to their knees.  McCain&amp;#039;s former economic adviser is ex-Texas Sen. Phil Gramm. On Dec. 15, 2000, hours before Congress was to leave for Christmas recess, Gramm had a 262-page amendment slipped into the appropriations bill. It forbade federal agencies to regulate the financial derivatives that greased the skids for passing along risky mortgage-backed securities to investors.  And that, my friends, is why everything&amp;#039;s falling apart. That is why the taxpayers are now on the hook for the follies of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Bear Stearns and now the insurance giant AIG to the tune of $85 billion.   .....  Another Gramm contribution was the &amp;quot;Enron loophole,&amp;quot; which prevented federal oversight of Enron&amp;#039;s electronic energy trading. Such favors proved very expensive to consumers but profitable to the Gramms. Enron CEO Ken Lay chaired Gramm&amp;#039;s 1992 re-election campaign, and wife Wendy Gramm spent years on the Enron board, earning as much as $1.8 million, according to Public Citizen, a consumer advocate.   http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/09/mccai...                         ...
