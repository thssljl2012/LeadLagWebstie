The Trustee and SIPC have worked in cooperation with regulators to establish protocols wherever possible to facilitate efforts to close out transactions in an orderly and expedited fashion. Other procedures are being instituted for return of prime brokerage accounts of cash and fully paid securities held for their accounts according to a protocol to be posted on SIPC&amp;#039;s Web site (   http://www.sipc.org  ) and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association&amp;#039;s (SIFMA) Web site (   http://www.sifma.org  ).     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Where applicable, procedures or protocols will be or have been the subject of further announcements by the Trustee, SIFMA and others.
