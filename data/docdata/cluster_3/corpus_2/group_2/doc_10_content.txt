 Know quite a few people on the forum are very worried about the present economic situation, just read this article thought it might cheers a few of you up for the weekend!!     &amp;amp;quot;The US Treasury says it is working on a &amp;amp;quot;comprehensive plan&amp;amp;quot; to ease America&amp;#039;s financial crisis while Britain has banned the short selling of shares in an effort to stabilise the markets.    Treasure Secretary Henry Paulson said he and congressional leaders were working to &amp;amp;quot;address systemic risks&amp;amp;quot; in US capital markets.    Both the US and Britain have banned the short selling of shares, which has been blamed by some experts for exacerbating the financial crisis.    The move came after Gordon Brown told Sky News the behaviour of some City institutions was &amp;#039;irresponsible&amp;#039;.    Asian markets opened this morning in a more buoyant mood following the US announcement.    Japanese share prices opened up just over 1% in Tokyo while Hong Kong&amp;#039;s Hang Seng index opened 7% up.    &amp;amp;quot;We talked about a comprehensive approach that will require legislation to deal with illiquid assets on financial institutions&amp;#039; balance sheets,&amp;amp;quot; Mr Paulson said.    &amp;amp;quot;We look forward to working closely with Congress to resolve this financial crisis and get our economy moving again,&amp;amp;quot; Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke added.    In Britain, the Financial Services Authority banned from midnight the short selling of shares.    That means traders cannot &amp;#039;borrow&amp;#039; or off-load shares only to buy them back later at a lower price.    New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo also announced a probe into illegal short-selling on Wall Street.    The US investigation will centre upon investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, whose shares have dived dramatically since the demise of the Lehman Brothers and insurance giant AIG, which was saved from near-collapse on Tuesday. The FSA measures are designed to stop traders creating a lack of confidence in companies by selling shares, actively contributing to a fall in price from which they profit when they buy them back.    Halifax Bank of Scotland blamed the practice for wiping more than &amp;amp;pound;3bn from its value before a takeover by Lloyds TSB reversed its fortunes.    Hector Sants, chief executive of the FSA, said: &amp;amp;quot;While we still regard short-selling as a legitimate investment technique in normal market conditions, the current extreme circumstances have given rise to disorderly markets.    &amp;amp;quot;As a result, we have taken this decisive action, after careful consideration, to protect the fundamental integrity and quality of markets and to guard against further instability in the financial sector.&amp;amp;quot;    All eyes will again be on the opening of London&amp;#039;s FTSE this morning.    It closed 32 points down last night, at 4880.    That&amp;#039;s the lowest it&amp;#039;s been at since 2005 - it&amp;#039;s been steadily falling since the start of this year.    The Dow Jones closed up over 400 points - a 3.8% increase on the day. &amp;amp;quot;   &amp;amp;nbsp;                                                                                                                                                                               Report Inappropriate Post
