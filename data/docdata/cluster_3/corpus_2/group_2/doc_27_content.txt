Barclays had to walk away from several potentially lucrative acquisition deals because their sub-prime exposure was already maxed out.  Lloyds has a huge exposure in their securities-reinsurance group which hasn&amp;#039;t been hit yet..but will be as more of the securities issurers fail.  The same is true of the Bank of America, its absolutely bizarre that they ended up buying Merrill since they are also holding huge bundles of sub-prime obligations (maybe 200B)..but look at their deal!  The US government is guarenteeing a portion of the acquistion of Merrill!  Let&amp;#039;s see, they get to buy Merrill at half valuation and have the marginal risk secured by the full faith and creidt of the US taxpayer!  WRONG!  I agree with Superdog, the Federal government&amp;#039;s propping this paper up with debt notes is far more dangerous than letting them fail.  But don&amp;#039;t forget, the guys getting propped up are cocktail chums with people like Greeenspan and Bernake.
