I doubt Bill Gates, Warren Buffet or George Soros have any significant exposure. The only exceptions will be people like Sam Zell and Donald Trump, and they may well have insulated themselves, somehow. Wall street ate a lot of its own dog food and it&amp;#039;s choking on it. And a lot of it was foisted on cities and towns, water districts, pension funds, etc.    I have no idea who you think these people being bailed out are. The people who are getting the money, and taking a major haircut for it, are the buyers of the securities. The stockholders of Lehman will be wiped out and those of Bear Stearns are getting $.10 on the dollar. 40% of Bear was owned by its employees. They lost over over $5 billion ($7 billion by my calculations, but we&amp;#039;ll go with Wikipedia). That&amp;#039;s $330,000 per employee, though, of course, the higher ups lost the more than the janitor.    These are the big bagholders        * Barrow Hanley Mewhinney &amp;amp; Strauss - 9.73%      * Joseph C. Lewis - 9.36%      * Morgan Stanley - 5.37%      * James Cayne - 4.94%      * Legg Mason Capital Management - 4.84%      * Private Capital Management - 4.69%      * Barclays Global Investors - 3.60%      * State Street 3.01%      * Vanguard Group - 2.67%      * Janus Capital Management - 2.34%      * Legg Mason Funds Management - 1.95%      * Fidelity Management- 1.93%      * Putnam Investment Management - 1.90%      * Neuberger Berman - 1.55%      * UBS - 1.54%         The banks have already taken $500 billion in charges. They can&amp;#039;t take too much more and have anything to lend or even probably stay in business, and there appears to be another $400 billion or so to take. This is very destructive, since the underlying assets haven&amp;#039;t lost nearly as much money as the derivatives based on them. You can indeed spend what you ain&amp;#039;t got and lose what you never had, and in spades.    The market inefficiencies are more damaging than any losses on the mortgages, themselves.    This was the situation with Bear and $13 trillion is not a typo.    &amp;quot;As of November 30, 2006, the company had total capital of approximately $66.7 billion and total assets of $350.4 billion. According to the April 2005 issue of Institutional Investor magazine, Bear Stearns was the seventh-largest securities firm in terms of total capital. See Bear Stearns&amp;#039; 2007 SEC 10k filing, on page 80.    As of November 30, 2007 Bear Stearns had notional contract amounts of approximately $13.40 trillion in derivative financial instruments, of which $1.85 trillion were listed futures and option contracts. In addition, Bear Stearns was carrying more than $28 billion in &amp;#039;level 3&amp;#039; assets on its books at the end of fiscal 2007 versus a net equity position of only $11.1 billion. This $11.1 billion supported $395 billion in assets,[3] which means a leverage ratio of 35.5 to 1. This highly leveraged balance sheet, consisting of many illiquid and potentially worthless assets, led to the rapid diminution of investor and lender confidence, which finally evaporated as Bear was forced to call the New York Federal Reserve to stave off the looming cascade of counterparty risk which would ensue from forced liquidation.&amp;quot;  .      thread start
