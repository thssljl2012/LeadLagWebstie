I think that when a company should go under that by all means it should go under, after all what is the difference if there is a mess to clean up after a big company goes under or there&amp;#039;s a mess to clean up to keep it from going under? not much difference to me as someone will be along to take it&amp;#039;s place, like Barclays swooping in to buy parts of Lehman Bros after the bankruptcy filing.     Here is a link to a very interesting article on the demise of Bear Sterns and on the last page it tells of a rumor that Lehman Bros was next and if you remember shortly after Bear Sterns went down that Lehman Bros did indeed have some trouble on the stock market, then the SEC stepped in with a bunch of talk and everything cooled off, for awhile.     http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/f..._stearns200808     this link is for page 8   http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/f...?currentPage=8
