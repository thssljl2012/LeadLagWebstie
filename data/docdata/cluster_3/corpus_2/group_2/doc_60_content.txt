       Re:  McCain&amp;#039;s former economic adviser is ex-Texas Sen. Phil Gramm. On Dec. 15, 2000, hours before Congress was to leave for Christmas recess, Gramm had a 262-page amendment slipped into the appropriations bill. It forbade federal agencies to regulate the financial derivatives that greased the skids for passing along risky mortgage-backed securities to investors....   ....On Monday, McCain issued a tough-talk statement that he was &amp;amp;quot;glad&amp;amp;quot; that the feds &amp;amp;quot;have said no to using taxpayer money to bail out Lehman Brothers, a position I have spoken about throughout this campaign.&amp;amp;quot; On Tuesday, the government did the daddy of all bailouts. It took over AIG, fearing its bankruptcy could set off a cataclysmic chain of events.   And do you know where the problems lay at AIG? They weren&amp;#039;t in its main insurance business. They were in its derivatives-trading unit.    I hadn&amp;#039;t known that.  I did know that McCain is constantly claiming to be &amp;amp;quot;anti-regulation.&amp;amp;quot;  He must be very happy with the way they run the baby formula market in China.  Thanks for posting.
