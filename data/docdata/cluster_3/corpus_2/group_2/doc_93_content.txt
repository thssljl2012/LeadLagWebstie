    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              &amp;quot;Frantic&amp;quot; day on Wall Street as the dominoes fall    http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/business/15lehman.html?ref=business&amp;amp;pagewanted=print   September 15, 2008  In Frantic Day, Wall St. Banks on Edge   By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN  In one the most extraordinary days in Wall Streets in history, Merrill Lynch is near an 11th-hour deal to avert a deepening financial crisis while another storied securities firm, Lehman Brothers, hurtled toward liquidation, according to people briefed on the deal.     The dramatic turn of events was prompted by the cataclysm of losses that has shaken the American financial industry over the last 14 months.     The moves came after a weekend of frantic negotiations between federal officials and Wall Street executives over how to avert a downward spiral in the markets. Questions still remain about how the market will react and whether other firms may still falter like A.I.G., the large insurer, and Washington Mutual, both of whose stocks fell precipitously last week.     Coming just a week after the government took control of mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the magnitude of the industrys reshaping is staggering: two of the most powerful firms on Wall Street, Merrill Lynch and Lehman, will disappear.     The weekends once unthinkable outcome came after a series of emergency meetings at the Federal Reserve building in downtown Manhattan in which the fate of Lehman hung in the balance. In the meeting Federal Reserve officials and the leaders of major financial institutions were trying to complete a plan to rescue the stricken investment bank.     But as the weekend unfolded, Barclays and Bank of America, which had both considered buying all or part of Lehman, decided that they could not reach a deal without financial support from the federal government or other banks.    As a result, people briefed on the matter said late Sunday that Lehman Brothers would file for bankruptcy protection, in the largest failure of an investment bank since the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert 18 years ago.    Lehman will seek to place its parent company, Lehman Brothers Holdings, into bankruptcy protection, as its subsidiaries remain solvent while the parent firm liquidates, these people said. A consortium of banks will provide a financial backstop to help provide an orderly winding down of the 158-year-old investment bank. And the Federal Reserve has agreed to accept lower-quality assets in return for loans from the government.    Lehman has retained the law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp;amp; Manges. The firms restructuring head, Harvey Miller, also spearheaded Drexels bankruptcy filing in February 1990.    As efforts to acquire Lehman faltered, Bank of America turned to Merrill Lynch and offered at least $38.25 billion in stock for that investment bank, people briefed on the negotiations said. The deal, valued at $25 to $30 a share, could be announced as soon as Sunday night, these people said. Merrill shares closed at $17.05 on Friday.    Merrills chief executive, John A. Thain, and Kenneth D. Lewis, Bank of Americas chief executive, initiated talks on Saturday, prompted by the reality that a Lehman bankruptcy would ripple through Wall Street and further cripple Merrill Lynch, people briefed on the negotiations said.     The leading proposal to rescue Lehman had been to divide the bank into two entities, a good bank and a bad bank. Under that last scenario, Barclays would have bought the parts of Lehman that have been performing well, while a group of 10 to 15 Wall Street companies would agree to absorb losses from the banks troubled assets, according to two people briefed on the proposal. Taxpayer money would not be included in such a deal, they said.    But that plan fell apart on Sunday, making it likely that Lehman would be forced to liquidate.    What remained unclear was how a liquidation might proceed. One option that was discussed on Saturday would have major banks and brokerage firms continue to do business with Lehman as it unwinds its assets and liquidates over a period of months, according to several people briefed on the discussions. That would buy Lehman time to sell those assets in an orderly way and avoid a fire sale that could depress prices of similar assets held by other banks.    The overarching goal of the weekend talks was to prevent a quick liquidation of Lehman, a bank that is so big and so interconnected with others that its abrupt failure would send shock waves through the financial world. Of deep concern is what impact a Lehman failure would have on other securities firms, insurance companies and banks, which have come under mounting pressure in the markets.    American International Group, one of the worlds largest insurers, may need to raise $30 billion to $40 billion to avoid a severe downgrade to its credit rating, according to people briefed on its situation. An A.I.G. spokesman, Nicholas J. Ashooh, called that estimate speculative and declined to comment further.    Some considered the weekend talks as high-stakes brinkmanship.    Both Barclays and Bank of America had expressed interest in buying Lehman and had initially insisted that the government provide financial support. But federal officials were adamant that no public money be used  a big point of contention because many of the top Wall Street executives believe that their banks, which have each written down tens of billions of dollars in assets, do not have the capacity to lead the rescue on their own.
