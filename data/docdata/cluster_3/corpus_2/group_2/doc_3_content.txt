Nice try, but you&amp;#039;re not telling the truth when it comes to financial and legislative cause and effect. The real cause of this is the deregulation of the insurance that backed up the mortgages. These &amp;amp;quot;credit default swaps&amp;amp;quot; were deregulated by the Repub&amp;#039;s in 2000, allowing companies like AIG to write insurance policies for banks giving out mortgages. But AIG didn&amp;#039;t have to treat it like real insurance, so they didn&amp;#039;t have to have capital backing it up. AIG got to write tons of policies and keep the profits. The banks got to write bad loans because they thought they had insurance backing them up. The bigger problem is that these credit default swaps are totally unregulated and traded among the big banking firms - so much so that it&amp;#039;s BIGGER THAN THE ENTIRE US STOCK MARKET AND TOTALLY UNREGULATED. Thank John McCain and the rest of the deregulation crowd for this one.
