Details of the plans could come as early as Monday. On Friday the insurer appointed investment bank JP Morgan to work on a rescue plan after its shares fell a record 31% in a single day. Assets under the hammer include Transatlantic Holdings, its New York-listed reinsurance group. Swiss Re and Munich Re, two giants of the European reinsurance business, are understood to be potential buyers. Other assets on the block are AIG&amp;amp;quot;s consumer finance, reinsurance and plane-leasing units, according to analysts at Citigroup.     Slainte  ...........Kauri
