Three of the five biggest brokerage houses in the US are now facing serious problems. Bear Stears was already bailed out be the government, Lehman Brothers is on the brink of filing for bankruptcy, and Meryl Lynch is trying to sell itself to Bank of America to raise enough capital to survive. Which leaves Goldman Sachs and one other that I can&amp;#039;t remember right now.  Plus, AIG, the US&amp;#039;s biggest insurance company, is looking for a buyer as well.  So basically we&amp;#039;re screwed. The economy is imploding. Hope you all had a nice life       I hope everyone realizes that in 50 years we will still have the strongest economy in the world, barring any catastrophic (i mean seriously, really catastrophic) events happening. The USA has the strongest economy ever, and will continue to have one for a while. Everyone makes this seem that the USA will end up like Zimbabwe, when in fact, the most this recession has done is make living standards for people who flip burgers worse, and people are less frivolous at stores. Calm down everyone.      I think you really don&amp;#039;t know anything about economics.  My friend&amp;#039;s mom knows a financial advisor who is telling people to take all of their money out of banks. DON&amp;#039;T PEOPLE REALIZE THAT IS HOW THE GREAT DEPRESSION STARTED?        &amp;amp;nbsp;                 Choose John McCain for president in 2008. Why not have another 8 years of outright lies and total incompetence?
