           Personally I think the American public is just being manipulated again. They have blown this whole bailout out of proprtions. If they allowed fannie mae,freddie mac and aig to collapse it wouldn&amp;#039;t have that big of an effect on the public or the property owners. The mortgages would be sold off to some other compnay. Other insurance companies would buy up the assets of aig. Would it effect the stock market? Absolutely. But the stock market should crash and burn. Its just legalized gambling. Does nothing to help the people of America other than to promote greed. You would have thought after the great depression people would have wized up about the stock market. But greed seems to be deeply inbedded in the American phsyche now adays.
