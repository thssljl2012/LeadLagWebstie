 I saw in the news Sunday night that Lehman Brothers is on the brink of bankruptcy. The Feds refused a bailout. Lehman is still trying to save itself by finding a buyer but can&amp;#039;t find one. Also Lehman&amp;#039;s third-quarter results showed nearly $4 billion in losses, plus Lehman had $85 billion worth of commercial and residential mortgages, worth only pennies on the dollar still on it&amp;#039;s books. Lehmans closed Friday at $3.65 , shares in the bank were at $66 in February. It is the fourth biggest investment bank on Wall Street.      Barclays Capital and Bank of America turned down a deal to buy Lehmans because Federal Reserve&amp;#039;s Ben Bernanke declined to offer a deal like the one the Feds gave JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns. ($29 billion taxpayer backed bailout).  The news reported Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke took heat from politicians on Capitol Hill and that was why there was no government guaranteed rescue.       There are a couple forms of insurance against corporate failures, one is called &amp;quot;credit default swaps&amp;quot; and the other is called &amp;quot;triparty repo&amp;quot; I believe. I&amp;#039;ve read they are insurance-like contracts that promise to cover losses on  securities in case of default. Both are a form of debt that funds all sorts of financial firms and is held by the money market mutual funds of Americans. These are part of the derivatives market that were repackaged and shuffled then sold as investments by hedge funds and banks.  Lehmans failure might hit some peoples mutual funds.  Supposedly these could cause a lot more bank failures. Here&amp;#039;s a link that talks about CDS&amp;#039;s and how they function;  http://www.time.com/time/business/ar...723152,00.html        Then after the story about Lehmans the news reported Bank of America made a deal to take over Merrill Lynch.  Bank of America didn&amp;#039;t get a federal guarantee either to take over Merrill Lynch.  It&amp;#039;s about time the federal government were to draw a line as to how much the taxpayers have to pay. The house of cards is begining to fall folks. I think next week could be a bad week for the market.
