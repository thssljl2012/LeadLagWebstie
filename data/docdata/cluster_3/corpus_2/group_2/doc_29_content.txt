           Advertisements [ ? ]                          From Krugman&amp;#039;s lips...   Obama moves swiftly to incorporate two new bits into his attacks on McCain, according to the prepared remarks for a speech in Daytona Beach, Florida, today:  &amp;quot;Theres only one candidate whos called himself fundamentally a deregulator when deregulation is part of the problem. My opponent actually wrote in the current issue of a health care magazine  the current issue, quote, Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation. So let me get this straight  he wants to run health care like theyve been running Wall Street. Well, senator, I know some folks on Main Street who arent going to think thats a good idea. &amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Theres only one candidate whose campaign is being run by seven of Washingtons most powerful lobbyists. And folks, it isnt me. I dont take a dime from Washington lobbyists and special interests. They do not run my campaign. They will not run my White House. And they will not drown out the voices of the American people when Im president of the United States. So when John McCain says that lobbyists &amp;#039;wont even get past the front gate&amp;#039; at his White House, my question is  whos going to stop them? Those seven lobbyists? His campaign manager? The economic adviser, who got a $40 million golden parachute when she was fired as a CEO? Or maybe the 26 advisers and fundraisers who lobbied for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? I mean, give me a break. The same day my opponent attacked me for being associated with a Fannie Mae guy Ive talked to for maybe five minutes in my entire life  the same day he did that  the head of the lobbying shop at Fannie Mae turned around and said wait a minute  &amp;#039;when I see photographs of Senator McCains staff, it looks to me like the team of lobbyists who used to report to me.&amp;#039; Folks, you cant make this stuff up.&amp;quot;   http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0908/From_Krugma...                         ...
