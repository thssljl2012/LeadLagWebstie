 A few months ago, in March, TD Banknorth merged with Commerce Bank forming a TD Bank. That was a better acquisition deal then the ones happening now though.    The Fed took over 4 banks, one very reluctantly (AIG $85 Billion) that means that the US economy is in even worse shape now. With 2 wars, borrowing money from China and bailing out 4 large investment banks, the economy is in real trouble now.   Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG Inc. were taken over by the Fed.    Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo were bought by Bank of America and Lehman Brothers was bought by Barclays of UK.     Its a good thing that some of the failed banks were bought by other banks, that means no real loss will be seen from them.    Im hoping that Chase will go through with its WaMu acquisition.
