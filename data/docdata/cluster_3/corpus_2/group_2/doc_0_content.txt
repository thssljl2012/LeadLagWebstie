On Friday, US short term treasury yields fell sharply and the TED spread took a big jump suggesting increased stresses in financial markets so none of this is coming as a surprise to most insiders. That the market hasn&amp;#039;t fallen apart yet with all the stuff going on in the background is perhaps an indication of strength rather than weakness. Bull markets fall from the stars and rise from the ashes and there is one heck of a large pile of ashes on Wall Street. If things do get out of control, I suspect it will signal a bottom rather than the beginning of a major slide from current levels, especially with a Fed meeting this week. More serious problems are likely on the horizon but probably next year rather than now.       thread start
