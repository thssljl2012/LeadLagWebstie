 &amp;amp;quot;Could be&amp;amp;quot; worse      Its hard to fathom what would happen if this istitution is allowed to collapse. It has 75 million clients but in actuality it would effect far m,ore people than 75 million. Insurance is a big part of AIG but the problem is in their assets and investments. Its like  dominoes. If one falls all the others are effected. If it was allowed to fall it would likely make the great depression seem like &amp;amp;quot;The Good Ol Days&amp;amp;quot;.      The tax money is secure also. The government is assured to make their money back by the sell off of AIG&amp;#039;s assets.      I don&amp;#039;t like bail outs either but there is some deep trouble in the global economy right now. A KEY sign that can not be overstated is the falling price   of oil. This is the first predicted sign of a failing global economy and is something to really worry about. Yeah, it seems we should be happy but thats not the case this time.         75 million is a very conservative estimate IMO.

I will say it.... this is an attempt by the administration to keep the economy from imploding before the election.                     Youre probably right. But I hope not. If the econemy fails on a global scale I can&amp;#039;t imagine what will be....
