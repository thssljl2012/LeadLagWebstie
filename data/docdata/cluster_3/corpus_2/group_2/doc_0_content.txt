Premi in vista per il personale americano, ma solo americano, di LEH. Mentre azionisti e obbligazionisti usciranno a mani vuote o allegerite, verranno distribuiti premi per 2,5 miliardi di $ allo staff americano della banca daffari, come premio per i profitti dei primi 9 mesi 2008...         Cita:                         From the UK&amp;#039;s Times:    Staff at Lehman&amp;amp;#8217;s New York office who helped to cause the world&amp;amp;#8217;s biggest corporate bankruptcy are to share in a $2.5 billion bonanza.    The bonus, which has been described by London staff as a &amp;amp;#8220;scandal&amp;amp;#8221; has been pledged by Barclays Capital, the British-based bank that last week acquired Lehman&amp;amp;#8217;s American operation and took on 10,000 staff.    The $2.5 billion (1.4 billion) pot, which has been ring-fenced as part of the acquisition, has caused huge resentment among the 5,000 staff in the firm&amp;amp;#8217;s European and Middle Eastern operations who are not guaranteed to be paid after this month...    A Chapter 11 bankruptcy document filed by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc says that Barclays has identified eight individuals out of the New York staff of 10,000 who are vital to make the deal succeed and a further 200 who are identified as &amp;amp;#8220;key&amp;amp;#8221;. It is thought that these eight directors will be locked into two-year contracts worth between $10m and $25m a year.    The $2.5 billion had been accrued as part of the contribution to Lehman&amp;amp;#8217;s group profits for the first nine months of the year. Barclays said there is no obligation to pay it out but analysts say the competitive pressure to keep key staff means he will have to....      Price Waterhouse Coopers (PWC), the administrator to Lehman&amp;amp;#8217;s European operation has demanded that the firm repay 4.4 billion that was transferred from the UK to Lehman&amp;amp;#8217;s US holding company just hours before the firm collapsed. This left London with no money to pay staff.
