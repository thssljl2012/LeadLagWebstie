AIG has not been bought by the fed. AIG has been given a HUGE loan, in exchange for a majority share in the stock, and there are going to be specific terms and time frames for AIG to buy their stock back.       The precedent for this was bailing out Chrysler in the seventies.       If AIG had been allowed to go under the entire insurance industry in this nation would have failed along with it. The Airline industry would have come to a halt overnight because AIG underwrites over 90% of all commercial aviation.                      Actually I agree. It is more like Fascism, I just don&amp;#039;t use that word here....too many people will then debate on that being a liberal trait.
