      This was not a &amp;amp;quot;run on banks&amp;amp;quot; like 1929. True it is a liquidity crisis but its not you and me withdrawing our money like in 29. It is the fact that bank A issued a loan to a guy making $42,000 a year for a $500K house. The guy with the loan thought he could squeak by for a year or two and then re-fi taking the equity, making 20% on his &amp;amp;quot;investment&amp;amp;quot;, sell for an additional 10% and retire fat and rich. (in reality this guy got foreclosed on) In the meantime Bank A needed to borrow money from Bank B to make more of these loans, so they put the loan (along with others) up as collateral assuming even in the event of foreclosure they still own an appreciating assets (the home). Bank B loans the money to Bank A, and buys &amp;amp;quot;insurance&amp;amp;quot; from Freddie or AIG on this &amp;amp;quot;asset&amp;amp;quot;. Now, AIG owns all these &amp;amp;quot;assets&amp;amp;quot;. Great, more collateral for more loans, well, those &amp;amp;quot;assets&amp;amp;quot; lost their value from falling home prices, foreclosures, tightening global credit and from the unintended consequences of Sarbanes Oxley (where you have to disclose the &amp;amp;quot;value&amp;amp;quot; of paper assets each day). BOOM goes the economy when banks can&amp;#039;t get loans. ANY business whose model depends on high debt ratios to run is in jeapordy even if they don&amp;#039;t know it yet. Check those D/E ratios before buying any stock   If you need to be leveraged to run your business you can kiss it goodbye. That is why Wells Fargo, Geico, Sees candy will all be fine, as well as the other Berkshire companies. They are Warren Buffet owned (or heavily invested in, in the case of WF) and his mantra is CASH, CASH, CASH, and no debt.         These mortgage backed securities and other shady &amp;amp;quot;assets&amp;amp;quot; actually have real value, they just have no buyers. So therefore the &amp;amp;quot;value&amp;amp;quot; is $0. and no cash can flow into the economy since all the financial institutions have to take large write downs on these &amp;amp;quot;assets&amp;amp;quot; each quarter.        Oh, and anyone who thinks that Chase and Wells Fargo and Citi are &amp;amp;quot;helping&amp;amp;quot; by buying up WAMU, Wachovia etc are fools. They bought them cuz they can make money at it. We will be left with a handful of banks when this is all over and the Wells&amp;#039; and Chases who stayed out of the get rich quick subprime mess will make so much money it will be sickening.        Gotta love this congress though.... voting no cuz they won&amp;#039;t get re-elected next year if they voted for it.  Politicians playing politics with YOUR money... so typical   _________________ What are you  WAITING  for?
