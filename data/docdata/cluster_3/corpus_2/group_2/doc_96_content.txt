 FNM Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 2              Ooops, my LEH flyer didn&amp;#039;t fly.     I am really, really surprised.  I had hoped that FULD and the others would have seen the wisdom in a $2 bid at the very least.  And to avoid any future shareholder litigation, $2 will seem like a real bargain.    Now, Treasury Officials, Federal Reserve Officers, BAC, Barclays, Goldman, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and a host, including Dick Fuld are vulnerable to criminal charges.      You should see some perp walks pretty soon.      Imho,    Wolf
