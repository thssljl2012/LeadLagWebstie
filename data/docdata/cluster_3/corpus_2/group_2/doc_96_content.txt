This was compounded by stupidity, greed and a lack of oversight and regulation by the Bush Adm. The low interest rates, Bush tax cuts and Republican massive spending helped Bush win reelection but have done lasting harm to our economy and to most Americans.        It will be very interesting to see what the markets do tomorrow.             This is all true.  Seth and I argue over who takes more blame Bush or Greenspan but either way, it&amp;#039;s all here.             Thanks, I guess we&amp;#039;ll let history decide blame, I guess the job now is to how to get this corrected, and make sure we have things in place moving forward so it doesn&amp;#039;t happen again.             Which means - Don&amp;#039;t vote for the GOP!             As I&amp;#039;ve mentioned on other threads, it&amp;#039;s irrelevant since neither plan to address the deficit.  Both plans will see an increase in US borrowing.
