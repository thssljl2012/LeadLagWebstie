A bail out is not the same as a buy out.  Merrill Lynch was a buy out - another company bought them with hopes of doing a better job, AIG was a bail out - they were given a loan to stay afloat.        Typically the investment world does not like bail outs.  A bail out normally prolongs the agony, so to speak, by propping up a company that can not stand on it&amp;#039;s own.  People who work in the markets usually prefer that companies go under or get taken over when they can no longer compete during a crisis period.  Cut the dead weight and hit the bottom as fast as possible, rather than have a long decline.  This is why no one saved Lehman&amp;#039;s.      However, AIG was an extreme case.  This is the largest insurance company in the world.  Letting AIG go under would be catastrophic to the global economy.      People tend to think of corporations as a handful of fat rich guys sitting in a boardroom collecting money, but large corporations are owned by millions of average people through their pension funds, mutual funds, insurance policies, and bank deposits.  AIG is not being bailed out to line the pockets of CEO&amp;#039;s, it is an attempt to prevent your bank from collapsing, your insurance from disappearing and your pension and investments from becoming worthless.
