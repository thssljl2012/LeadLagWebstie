Don&amp;#039;t walk, run to treasuries.&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;    &amp;amp;nbsp;    I prefer index puts. Resolution of the LEH situation is going to test the markets. If the LEH thing gets handled well it should be a big positive for the markets but probably won&amp;#039;t change a bear market into a bull or an economic slowdown into an expansion.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;W  SJ on tomorrow         The Mother of All Mondays    Posted by Tim Annett             Investors world-wide  have rarely rolled out of bed to face a Monday morning  quite like the one theyll contend with this Monday.    Sundays have long been host to important corporate news, from big mergers to bankruptcies. But this weekend, in an extraordinary meeting that recalled  the summit called ten years ago amid the meltdown of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management  and  J. Pierpont Morgans efforts more than 100 years ago to rescue a series of ailing banks , Wall Streets most senior deal makers and regulators raced to find a deal that would keep storied   Lehman Brothers Holdings   from collapse. At this hour, their efforts have yet to yield any fruit.   Barclays  , which had come to be viewed over the weekend as the most likely bidder for the badly ailing Lehman, pushed away from the bargaining table on Sunday. The main impediment appeared to be  that the U.S. government is reluctant to backstop a deal , as it had amid the Bear Stearns meltdown in March.    If Lehman cant find a life raft, it could lead to  turmoil in the credit markets as traders rework credit-default swaps and other trades with Lehman at their center . Credit-default swaps traders were called to work Sunday, the Wall Street Journal reported, for a special trading session that would let Lehman counterparties offset their positions against each other. Equity markets could also be roiled Monday. The crumbling of a major Wall Street institution is likely to shake badly the confidence of investors who had hoped the Street  would make it through the credit crisis without yet another large firm being swallowed up . Whats more, the economic backdrop looks dimmer than it did in March when Bear Stearns was pushed into the arms of Jamie Dimon.     Any  forced selling of stocks or other securities by hedge funds and other big investors  linked to Lehman could further destabilize the markets. Market sentiment has been fragile for months, causing wild gyrations that have given equities little chance to establish momentum in one direction or the other. Investors have  skipped in and out of Treasurys and other safe-haven bets  and money that was pushed into commodities bets has  suffered amid the jarring drop in the price of oil and other raw materials since July .    One possible Lehman suitor,   Bank of America  , has reportedly meanwhile taken up merger talks with another brokerage giant that has been battered by the credit crisis    Merrill Lynch  . Strategically, a union of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch would merge BofAs sprawling retail banking business with Merrills vast brokerage network. Bank of America has a deep well of capital due to its massive deposit base. A deal could  chase at least some of the gloom swirling around the financial sector because of Lehman . Merrill shares were slammed last week alongside Lehman.    Adding to the whorl,   American International Group   (whose shares were also clobbered last week amid growing concern about the extent of its losses on CDS and other derivatives) plans to  disclose a restructuring on that Monday that is likely to include the sale of major assets, including its aircraft-leasing business , International Lease Finance Corp., the Journal reported today. The insurance giant, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average,  is hoping to raise more than $10 billion . The company has already raised $20 billion in fresh capital this year.      UPDATE at 6:39 PM EDT:  Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were   down roughly 300 points   in recent trading.     UPDATE at 6:48 PM EDT:  The Journal is reporting that a Bank of America-Merrill deal is closer, with an all-stock deal expected at $26 a share or greater. However, the situation remained fluid and any deal could still falter. Meanwhile AIG plans to shift capital from its regulated insurance business to its holding company, a source has told the Journal. The move is intended to improve AIGs liquidity position. The measures involve $0 to $50 billion in capital allocation and new capital, the source says.               thread start
