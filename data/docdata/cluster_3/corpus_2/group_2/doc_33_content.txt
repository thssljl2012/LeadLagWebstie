Take a look at the cozy deal already done with Lehman Brothers:   Fury at $2.5bn bonus for Lehman&amp;#039;s New York staff   By David Prosser Monday, 22 September 2008 Related Articles  Up to 10,000 staff at the New York office of the bankrupt investment bank Lehman Brothers will share a bonus pool set aside for them that is worth $2.5bn (1.4bn), Barclays Bank, which is buying the business, confirmed last night.  The revelation sparked fury among the workers&amp;#039; former colleagues, Lehman&amp;#039;s 5,000 staff based in London, who currently have no idea how long they will go on receiving even their basic salaries, let alone any bonus payments. It also prompted a renewed backlash over the compensation culture in global finance, with critics claiming that many bankers receive pay and rewards that bore no relation to the job they had done.  A spokesman for Barclays said the $2.5bn bonus pool in New York had been set aside before Lehman Brothers filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States a week ago. Barclays has agreed that the fund should continue to be ring-fenced now it has taken control of Lehman&amp;#039;s US business, a deal agreed by American bankruptcy courts over the weekend.  ...   2.5 Billion Ripoff   This is the kind of crap that gets rushed through in the middle of the night when they&amp;#039;re screaming about emergency.  The first thing that should have been after the feds took over Lehman Brothers was to take the $2.5 billion and put it in the taxpayer&amp;#039;s bank.  In a sane world, Paulson, Bernanke and the rest of the architects of this cozy deal would be fired and replaced by people with brains.   &amp;quot;Being ignorant is not so much a Shame, as being unwilling to learn.&amp;quot;  Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard&amp;#039;s Almanack, 1755
