If AIG failed to meet these obligations, it would have been a devastating blow to the American financial community.Devastating in this context could have meant something like that bank run in Its a Wonderful Life on mega-steroids but without that annoying Uncle whose carelessness almost got George thrown in jail. The terms illiquid,insolvent, and panic would have received frequent use. Contra Senator Obama, the government didnt bail out AIG because the guys at the Fed and Treasury wanted to do a solid for their pals at AIG. AIG got bailed out because its failure would have been catastrophic. Furthermore, the Feds terms for the bailout were Draconian. AIG stockholders and executives arent laughing all the way to the bank this morning. The companys CEO is gone, his departure a condition of the bailout. Ive written many times here that I believe Senator Obama is a fundamentally good man. This is an opportunity for him to show his qualities as a leader. It would be helpful if he would try to calm the markets rather than further agitate them. I wouldnt dare hope for him to express his confidence in the markets or the economy  since he obviously understands neither, such a declaration would ring hollow anyway. But since he doesnt understand the issues to such an extent that hes unwilling to take a position on whether or not the AIG bailout is a good thing, is it too much to ask for him to refrain from playing the arsonist?     Tremendous series of posts!!! I applaud you sir (or ma&amp;#039;am). Very well done!
