I&amp;#039;m sure it seems ok to everyone with an insurance policy with or a stake in AIG.  Which is... basically everyone if you count indirect influence.  If you would have preferred the alternative, you&amp;#039;re probably thinking something like, &amp;quot;Let &amp;#039;em go under!  It&amp;#039;s their own fault!  What could possibly go wrong?&amp;quot;  You tell us.  It&amp;#039;s that last bit that has everyone worried enough that the Fed felt it was prudent to do this awful thing.  Like someone else said, would you still be angry if letting AIG go bankrupt would have cost you your retirement savings and your job because of the fallout?  I believe the groundwork for this day was put down years ago with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, voted for by a Republican Congress and signed into law by President Clinton.  I don&amp;#039;t know what&amp;#039;s next, but I&amp;#039;d put money on a partial repeal of Gramm-Leach-Bliley back to the way things were.  Regulation&amp;#039;s coming, and even the Republicans are going to support it.
