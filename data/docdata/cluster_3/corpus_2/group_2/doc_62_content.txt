 Edited on Sun Sep-21-08 03:55 PM by Rabrrrrrr         &amp;quot;that people can&amp;#039;t afford&amp;quot; - the only investing they do is for High Net Worth people.  Secondly, Lehman Brothers IS an investment bank, but they do institutional investing and also only do personal investing for High Net Worth people. They do not do investing or brokerage at all for people with less than 10 million (or so) to invest.  And so, your theory that they are taking money from &amp;quot;people who can&amp;#039;t afford it&amp;quot; is erroneous there as well.  And in both cases, the only loss that any clients would see is if they got the clients to invest in either AIG or Lehman, or got them into investing into the mortgage fiasco.
