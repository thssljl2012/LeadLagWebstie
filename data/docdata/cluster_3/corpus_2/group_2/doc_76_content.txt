 Woops.   John McCain:     Quote:                         &amp;amp;quot;Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.&amp;amp;quot;                      http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/200...ng-and-health/            Quote:                         So McCain, who now poses as the scourge of Wall Street, was praising financial deregulation like 10 seconds ago  and promising that if we marketize health care, it will perform as well as the financial industry!
