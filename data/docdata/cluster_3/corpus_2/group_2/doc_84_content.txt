John McCains economic adviser Carly Fiorina Does not Think He can Run Her Company  Category: MySpace    John McCain&amp;#039;s economic adviser Carly Fiorina hidden away after gaffes  An economic adviser to John McCain has disappeared from public view after saying that neither he nor his running mate Sarah Palin were capable of running a major corporation.    By Jon Swaine  Last Updated: 2:55PM BST 18 Sep 2008  Carly Fiorina, who rose from a secretarial position to become chief executive of the technology giant Hewlett-Packard, made the gaffes in two separate interviews.   First she was asked by a radio host - who had just praised her own business record  that since Mr McCain &amp;quot;thinks Mrs Palin has the experience to be president ... do you think she has the experience to run a major company like Hewlett-Packard?&amp;quot;   Miss Fiorina replied: &amp;quot;No, I don&amp;#039;t. That&amp;#039;s not what she is running for.&amp;quot;   Asked later in a television interview about her remark, Ms Fiorina said: &amp;quot;Well, I don&amp;#039;t think John McCain could run a major corporation.&amp;quot;  Miss Fiorina has since had planned television appearances cancelled. The incident comes as a blow to Mr McCain, who has seen a brief lead in opinion polls over Barack Obama fade away, the match-up returning to a tie.  He has faced criticism for his lack of credentials on economic policy at a time when America is suffering from a global financial crisis.  Mr McCain found himself wrong-footed by the US government&amp;#039;s 47bn bailout of the insurance giant AIG, and was forced to declare support for the action after opposing it only hours earlier.  Mr Obama&amp;#039;s campaign pounced on Miss Fiorina&amp;#039;s comments as apparent evidence of his unsuitability to guide the US through difficult economic times.  In a statement it said: &amp;quot;If John McCain&amp;#039;s top economic adviser doesn&amp;#039;t think he can run a corporation, how on earth can he run the largest economy in the world in the midst of a financial crisis?&amp;quot;    An economic adviser to John McCain has disappeared from public view after saying that neither he nor his running mate Sarah Palin were capable of running a major corporation.
