 CNN) -- British bank Barclays said it had reached a deal Wednesday to purchase key units of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers for $1.75 billion, as turbulent global markets continued to worry investors.       The deal came just two days after Barclays walked away from talks to buy the beleaguered financial institution in its entirety.      Barclays will acquire Lehman&amp;#039;s North American investment banking and capital markets businesses for $250 million in cash.      Barclays will also purchase Lehman&amp;#039;s New York headquarters and two data centers in New Jersey at their current market value estimated at $1.5 billion, a company statement said.       Lehman Brother Holdings -- mired in bad mortgage-related investments -- failed to secure a government loan or buyout deals with Barclays and Bank of America over the weekend and subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday.       http://edition.cnn.com/2008/BUSINESS...ef=mpstoryview
