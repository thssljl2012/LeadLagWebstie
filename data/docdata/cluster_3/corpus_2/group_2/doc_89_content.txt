Sorry I didn&amp;#039;t get to this earlier. Anyways, to your first statement: no, these companies do not have the capital to float the $700 billion buyout. That&amp;#039;s precisely why they&amp;#039;re in trouble -- their worth is tied up in investments and assets. When the market fell last week and AIG&amp;#039;s stock dropped, their credit rating also fell, and that means that they were required to prove possession of more liquid capital to post against their debts (just before the fed intervened, people were estimating that AIG needed to raise $80 billion). They didn&amp;#039;t have that capital. AIG and other companies are worth loads of money, yes, but that does not mean they can pull their worth in cash whenever they want. If they tried to bring in that kind of money too quickly, their assets would wind up being sold at undervalued prices, which causes a serious upset to the economy. The fed intervened with AIG to prevent exactly that from happening. Now they&amp;#039;re intervening on a much larger scale.  Second, Lehman&amp;#039;s New York office is sharing in a $2.5 billion bonus payout from Barclays, the British bank that purchased sectors of Lehman. Lehman itself is not paying the bonus.
