 AIG is in deep S***!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Merrill got bailed out by BofA, Lehman is bankrupt.......    And Obama, wants to raise taxes on the middle/upper middle/upper class...    My question is, and i don&amp;#039;t want to seem argumentative, how can he really justify it in his speeches, with all that is going on??    Healthcare reform won&amp;#039;t do anything for jobs, lets be quite honest......AIG is a huge insurance company that covers all forms of insurance.    I just cannot see obama, doing the same old song and dance much longer especially with all that is going on........with the recent activity of Lehman, Merrill, and AIG......there are lots of new voters for both sides.........and that isn&amp;#039;t even counting the Bear Stearn employees and Fannie Mae and Mac employees, and also remember that not all these employees are multi-millionaires....
