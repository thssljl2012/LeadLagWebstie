 Suppose we&amp;#039;ll just be left with a big three then HSBC, RBS and Lloyds-Hbos! I&amp;#039;m sure though some other bank like Santander will spot an opening and use their Abbey-Alliance and leiceister portfolio to take it to the big three so less choice but competition should still be strong.
