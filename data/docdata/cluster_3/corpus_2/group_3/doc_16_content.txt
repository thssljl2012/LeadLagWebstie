         If the merger does not go ahead, then there is little doubt that, like Barclays, Lloyds could raise the Tier 1 capital (required to be able to benefit from the Government guarantee on inter bank loan s) in the private sector, which would enable them to continue paying dividends.  One the other hand if the deal does go ahead, then the increased Tier 1 capital needs will make it absolutely essential that the Governement is used as a source of capital and bang goes the dividend.  Yes, the merger will create an entity which would not have been allowed under competition rules just a few weeks ago and for long term investors, this may be a big attraction, particularly as the forecast synergistic savings of 1bn per annum as not considered to be a difficult target.  However, what it to say that, in 5 years time, the competition authories will not then decide to look at the dominant position in domestic banking and order some disposals.  If this happens all that Lloyds shareholders will have done is forgone five years of dividends and an early years depressed share price simply to have the future benefits taken away when the dominant position start to deliver the rewards of foregoing the dividend.  Personally, I see no reason to give up the right to receive a dividend and see the share price depressed for the life of the preference shares simply in order to save HBOS.  HBOS and its massive captial requirements are not the problem of Lloyds shareholders.    HBOS shareholders losing their dividend for 5 years in return for Government support is fair.  However, if the Government wants Lloyds to save HBOS, it should not penalise the Lloyds shareholders for helping to achieve this objective.  The problem however, is that, if the merger goes ahead, the HBOS shareholders will become Lloyds shareholders and will rank pari passu existing Lloyds shareholders.   There is therefore no way of squaring this circle.  I will be voting against the merger.
