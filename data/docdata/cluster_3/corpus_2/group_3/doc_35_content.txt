Most troubling has been the collapse in confidence and supply of liquidity in major banks, burdened by unknown amounts of bad debs related to sub-prime mortgages.        The markets responded after European leaders, led by UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown outlined plans which will see more than a trillion dollars pumped into the banking sector.

Sarkozy said the money included $436 billion to guarantee bank refinancing and another $54 billion for a government-backed financing vehicle to provide banks with the capital they need.
