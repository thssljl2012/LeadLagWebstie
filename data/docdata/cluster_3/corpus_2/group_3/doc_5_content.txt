          Official RNS...   http://www.thelondonstockexchange.com/LSECWS/IFSPages/Market... ...    Thats all very well, but how do we know its true? Robert Peston hasn&amp;#039;t put it on his blog yet!  ;-)   ...his blog still claims &amp;amp;quot;One banker told me that what he called the Gang of Three of Barclays, RBS and Lloyds TSB told Darling to pull his finger out and finalise whatever it is he&amp;#039;s eventually prepared to offer on taxpayers&amp;#039; behalf.&amp;amp;quot;  Peston seems to be persisting in sailing close to the wind on stories like this.....sooner or later he&amp;#039;ll overstep the mark once too often - and then he&amp;#039;ll be toast!  ee
