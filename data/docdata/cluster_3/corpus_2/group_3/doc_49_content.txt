           Governments are notoriously toxic when it comes to the private sector at the best of times but in this climate I shudder to think what could happen. With Lloyds taking a Government handout, rather than approach their shareholders, to get up to the new Government mandated tear 1 ratio they simply became another failed bank being bailed out in the eyes of the public.    Excellent point and why LLOY should NOT have been seen as the so called &amp;#039;bail out&amp;#039; at the same time as it does seem as to the public and more importantly the politicians as though they were no different to RBS and HBOS and nothing I have seen or heard tells us that Daniels or Blank have tried to defend themselves against that charge..  ie why should LLOY be treated as the same as RBS and HBOS and you have to remember that HBOS are taking on many more billions of pounds than LLOY are and when/if the takeover goes through, that money will have to be repaid from the LLOY coffers as well as the HBOS ones but what happens if the HBOS side can&amp;#039;t repay the money as quick as some think?..  Surely the lesson from the US and with NR,B&amp;amp;amp;B and Barclays is that you do NOT takeover any financial institution that is bust/insolvent unless it goes bust or taken over by the government and the remnants are available at a knock down price..LLOY were originally going to pay 9bn pounds for HBOS and even 6bn seems to much in the current climate?
