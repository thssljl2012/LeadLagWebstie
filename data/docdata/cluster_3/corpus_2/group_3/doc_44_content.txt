         A news item (and more on Robert Peston&amp;#039;s blog) suggests that Barclays isn&amp;#039;t sailing through it all:   http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7665645.stm    Meanwhile, the BBC learned that four of Britain&amp;#039;s biggest banks will ask for up to 40bn of taxpayers&amp;#039; money as capital to boost their balance sheets.   Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS, Lloyds TSB and Barclays are in talks with the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority.      A figure of 8bn is suggested in connection with Barclays.  Weezy
