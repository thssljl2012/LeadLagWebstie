         I&amp;#039;ve never been a fan of Barclays, but they&amp;#039;ve just pulled a fast one on Lloyds.  Barclays directors obviously knew that all the other major banks would be asking for money and getting strings attached, which would pull the share prices down, so they reckoned that if Barclays didn&amp;#039;t ask for money (even though they need it), their share price would rise, helping their financial situation just by that alone, but it would also give them a better chance of raising money by issuing more shares as there would be more confidence in their bank. Good on them. Barclays share price should outperform Lloyds for a long time (and I don&amp;#039;t own any - yet).
