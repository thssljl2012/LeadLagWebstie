  1 in every 5 of British savers&amp;#039; money is held in HBOS accounts of one sort or another. In total this amounts to about 278bn.     Should be a lot safer soon than it ever was, because Lloyds TSB is going to take it over.       Doesn&amp;#039;t ICICI Bank (UK) Ltd own Lloyds TSB? I&amp;#039;m not sure. Anyhow, somebody owns it.
