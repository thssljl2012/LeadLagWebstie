         Yikes!     Treasury sources confirmed that the Government had drawn up plans to take on a majority stake in Royal Bank of Scotland and big holdings in Lloyds TSB, HBOS and Barclays under its 500bn plan to bail out the banking industry.     Looks like RBS wasn&amp;#039;t a good punt even at 70p !
