 CWEI Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 4              London-Take over of two large banks-Point to the change in policy of the Americans in their suspension of  &amp;quot;Mark to Market&amp;quot; believe International Accounting standards should change-IMO it is a winning idea-     October 12, 2008    THE government will launch the biggest rescue of Britains high-street banks tomorrow when the UKs four biggest institutions ask for a 35 billion financial lifeline.     The unprecedented move will make the government the biggest shareholder in at least two banks.     Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), which has seen its market value fall to below 12 billion, is to ask ministers to underwrite a 15 billion cash call.     Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS), Britains biggest provider of mortgages, is seeking up to 10 billion.   Lloyds TSB, which is in the process of acquiring HBOS in a rescue merger, wants 7 billion, while Barclays needs 3 billion.     The scale of the fundraising could lead to trading at the London stock market being suspended. This would give time for the market to digest the impact of the moves.     One consequence of the deal might be that Lloyds could renegotiate the terms of the HBOS takeover, although both sides are still keen for the merger to take place.     An economist who declined to be named said: This is the biggest risk of the UKs balance sheet ever undertaken. No-one knows the extent of the toxic assets these banks are exposed to.     Separately, the future of Morgan Stanley, the American investment bank, is also in doubt today following a sharp sell-off of shares and warnings of a possible credit downgrade from Moodys the ratings agency.     Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group is reviewing the terms of a $9 billion (5.3 billion) capital injection into the bank and may launch a takeover. HSBC, Citigroup, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank are also assessing the situation. Morgan Stanleys market value has slumped to $13 billion.     The British bank rescue could leave the government owning 70% of HBOS and 50% of RBS. As a result it could take board seats at both companies and exercise control over future dividend payments.       An auction process on Friday night determined that the collapse of Lehman Brothers will cost providers of credit default swaps an estimated $233 billion payout  which has to be paid in the next two weeks..     While much of the exposure is expected to sit with AIG, the insurance giant that has been partially nationalised, a number of banks are thought to have issued insurance against bank collapses that will now be called upon. Pressure is mounting on the International Accounting Standards Board to abandon its mark-to-market accounting principles, which many believe has been one of the key factors in causing the credit crisis.     The rules insist that assets be held on a banks book at the most recently traded market price. As the markets took fright from exotic credit derivatives, the prices fell well below what is considered to be their true economic value  leading to bigger than expected paper losses being taken by the banks. As the markets have crashed, the problem has become ever more acute.     On Friday night, Americas chief accounting body, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, revealed that it would suspend the mark-to-market rules to take account of extreme market conditions. Institutions will be able to use their own estimates of an assets worth instead. The move follows pressure from the US Securities and Exchange Commission.     In a position statement, the board said: In determining fair value for a financial asset, the use of a reporting entitys own assumptions about future cash flows and appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates is acceptable when relevant observable inputs are not available.
