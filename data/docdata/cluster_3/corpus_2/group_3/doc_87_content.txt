   Is that from the London Times or BBC or what?     http://www.financialexpress.com/news/five-uk-banks-may-qualify-for-us-bailout-package/366287/?ref=patrick.net          Attributing to analysts&amp;#039; estimates and the banks&amp;#039; own recent filings, the report said HSBC had as much as 45 billion pounds in structured mortgage debt and other soured assets sitting on its balance sheet that it might look to exchange with the Fed under the plan.      &amp;quot;Next are Barclays, with 17.4 billion pounds, Royal Bank of Scotland with 16.2 billion pounds and HBOS with 13.3 billion pounds,&amp;quot; the report said quoting analysts.    Well there ya go. We obviously take investments from out of town, but that&amp;#039;s a lot, to me.   This is bad.  But, seriously, I&amp;#039;m not surpised.
