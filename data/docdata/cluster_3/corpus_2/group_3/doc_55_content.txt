No!It is managing to budget these ground breaking measures because they are funded by the English and Welsh taxpayer!   I have always been in favour of Scotland becoming independent!Why?So that it will give the English taxpayer a fighting chance!   Whilst on the subject of Scotland! When will they offer thanks to the English for once again bailing them out of the financial hole they dug themselves into!By that I mean Lloyds TSB taking over HBOS (Halifax Bank of Scotland)   Before Beastie comes back with his usual un informed rhetoric!The majority shareholder in Lloyds TSB is M&amp;amp;amp;G which is an English company!   I cannot complete my contribution without adding!Where would Scotland be?If it had not got the English to help them out of the mess they keep getting into!
