Behind the panic: Financial warfare over the future of global bank power By F. William Engdahl Online Journal Contributing Writer  &amp;amp;lt;snip&amp;amp;gt; Paulson seems to have learned from his White House mentor. As co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, according to a New York Times account, in 1998 he forced out his co-chairman, Jon Corzine in what amounted to a coup.  It is becoming clear Paulson, and his friends at Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase, had a strategy, as did the godfather of asset backed securitization and deregulated banking, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, as I have detailed in my earlier series, Financial Tsunami, Parts I-V.  Knowing that at a certain juncture the pyramid of trillions of dollars of dubious subprime and other high risk home mortgage-based securities would come falling down, they apparently determined to spread the so-called toxic waste ABS securities as globally as possible, in order to seduce the big global banks of the world, most especially of the EU, into their honey trap.  They had help. In recent testimony under oath by Eric Dinallo, the superintendent of the New York Insurance Department at the AIG bailout oversight hearing into the AIG rescue by Paulson, Dinallo said that funding cutbacks in recent years directed by the Bush-Cheney administration had reduced the responsible department that should regulate or watch over the $80 trillion in asset backed securities (ABS), which included the toxic subprime and Alt-A mortgage securities and much more.  The Bush administration cut the staff of more than 100 people down to one -- yes that was not a typo. One as in uno.   Was that just ideological budget cutting fervor, or was it deliberate? Was former Goldman Sachs man, the man who convinced the president to hire Paulson, Bushs former director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Joshua Bolten, now the presidents chief of staff, responsible for insuring there was no effective government oversight of the exploding securitization of mortgage assets?  It now would appear that the Paulson strategy was to use a crisis -- a crisis that was pre-programmed and predictable as far back as 2003 when Josh Bolten became head of OMB -- when it exploded, to panic the more conservative European Union governments into rushing to the rescue of US toxic waste assets. ----------------- add link                       ...
