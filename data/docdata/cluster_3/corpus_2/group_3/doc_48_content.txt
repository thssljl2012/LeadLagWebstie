The unprecedented move will make the government the biggest shareholder in at least two banks. The Royal Bank of Scot-land (RBS), which has seen its market value fall to under 12 billion, is to ask the government to underwrite a 15 billion cash call. HBOS, which is Britains biggest provider of mortgages, is requesting up to 10 billion. Lloyds TSB, which is in the process of acquiring HBOS, and Barclays require 7 billion and 3 billion. ... The British bank rescue could leave the government owning 70% of HBOS and 50% of RBS. ... Further capital is also available and the Treasury has increased the total amount to 75 billion.      The nationalization begins.    Well, from a global perspective, the nationalization has been ongoing    (Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, AIG).  They just haven&amp;#039;t framed it as such.     Too bad it wasn&amp;#039;t done prior to the looting spree, rather than after...  Which is not to say that I&amp;#039;d have supported such a move, but it makes for an interesting &amp;quot;What If?&amp;quot; scenario.  If nothing else, this whole collapse shows that if we want banks to be private entities, then we have to construct the kind of framework where that can exist w/o any need for govt infusions of cash, where their own weaknesses can&amp;#039;t destroy them.
