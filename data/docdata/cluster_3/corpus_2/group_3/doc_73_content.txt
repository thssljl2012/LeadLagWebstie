         Barclays is set to unveil a 2bn-plus rescue package that will see the Qatar Investment Authority boost its investment in the British bank where it already owns an 8 per cent stake.  A deal that could be announced in days will see the Qataris subscribe to 1bn worth of new loan stock with another 1bn being taken up by Barclays&amp;#039; existing institutional investors.   http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/oct/26/qatar-barclay...
