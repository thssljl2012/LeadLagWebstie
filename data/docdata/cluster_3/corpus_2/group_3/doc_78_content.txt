       I don&amp;#039;t think I&amp;#039;d touch RBS, but Barclays might be interesting. I&amp;#039;m no expert on any of this, though.  Some sketchy detail of the scheme here:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7658277.stm   Banks will have to increase their capital by at least 25bn and can borrow from the government to do so.  An additional 25bn in extra capital will be available in exchange for preference shares.  100bn will be available in short-term loans from the Bank of England, on top of an existing loan facility worth 100bn.  Up to 250bn in loan guarantees will be available at commercial rates to encourage banks to lend to each other.  To participate in the scheme banks will have to sign up to an FSA agreement on executive pay and dividends.   What it might mean for existing pfd dividends I&amp;#039;m not sure.  The ordinary share movements have been wild over the last couple of days.
