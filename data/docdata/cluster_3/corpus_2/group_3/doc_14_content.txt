         &amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;Dithering darling, oh how I  wishes  he had another job&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;  Are you mutating into Gollum, by any chance?  :)  I&amp;#039;d prefer Darling to take his time and come up with a well thought out plan rather than go off at half-cock like the chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel. In my view her comments started the current round of panic and the whole &amp;amp;quot;my guarantee is bigger than your guarantee&amp;amp;quot; pi**ing contest. If she&amp;#039;d &amp;amp;quot;dithered&amp;amp;quot; you wouldn&amp;#039;t be moaning about Darling &amp;amp;quot;dithering&amp;amp;quot;.   By the way, thought you might be interested in this snippet from Investegate&amp;#039;s market report:   Royal Bank of Scotland leads the fallers down 22.01% or 32.5p at 114.5p. Its share price is being driven down by a market rumour that its head Fred Goodwin has asked the government for emergency funds, together with Barclays&amp;#039; head John Varley.    That could account for why RBS has been more badly affected than the other banks. HSBC is up on the day at the time of writing.
