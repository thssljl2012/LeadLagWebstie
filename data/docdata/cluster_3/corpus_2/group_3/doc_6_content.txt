          Don&amp;#039;t get me wrong - I&amp;#039;m holding back firepower here myself. Nonetheless it puzzles me why RBS is being hit up in the media and markets. It seems like little more than a witch-hunt. The known facts seem to favour RBS over the other two (BARC/LLOY). That&amp;#039;s what I don&amp;#039;t understand.    RBS has a bigger funding gap.   No, it doesn&amp;#039;t.    http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;amp;sid=a3cQ...    RBS has about 11.5 billion pounds of obligations coming due in the next six months, while Barclays, the U.K.&amp;#039;s second-biggest bank by market value, has 15.9 billion pounds maturing, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.   This information has been posted on this forum already several times.   BARC is in a considerably tighter situation than RBS. Less cash in hand raised through rights issue; lower writedowns so far; not gaining deposits the way RBS has from HBOS; and a bigger funding gap than RBS.  comp.
