 LONDON - A stream of European government announcements of plans to shore up financial systems started hitting the market Monday morning. The governments of Britain, France, Germany and Italy would be among the nations announcing plans Monday, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said at a Paris meeting of euro zone leaders on Sunday. The plans would fall within a framework agreed by the leaders, which included buying stakes in banks and guaranteeing bank deposits.  The most detailed plan so far has come from the United Kingdom. The British government said early Monday morning that it was making 37.0 billion pounds ($63.4 billion) in new Tier 1 capital available to U.K. banks to boost their liquidity and help them restructure. It would compel banks to change their remuneration policies and would halt bonuses for board members. Moreover, the government is creating a new company to manage investments in banks.   ....  Three British banks were set to tap the government for money: Royal Bank of Scotland was the biggest beneficiary, getting 20.0 billion pounds ($34.3 billion). Its chief executive, Fred Goodwin, also announced his resignation. HBOS was raising 11.5 billion ($19.7 billion) from the government, and Lloyds TSB, 5.5 billion ($9.4 billion). (Lloyds also renegotiated its takeover deal with HBOS.) Barclays said it would raise 6.5 billion pounds ($11.1 billion) from shareholders--and thus without the help of the government--and cancel its dividend this year, saving about 2.0 billion pounds ($3.4 billion).    http://www.forbes.com/markets/2008/10/13/europe-bailout...
