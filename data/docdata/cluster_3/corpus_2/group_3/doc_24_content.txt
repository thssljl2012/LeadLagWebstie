         The government turned a blind eye to the competition issues and let Lloyds merge with HBOS because HBOS was going bust.  Now that the government has rescued HBOS, it shouldn&amp;#039;t allow the merger to go ahead because of reduced competition.  I think Lloyds should just carry on as before as a high street bank with a relatively cautious approach; ignore the offer to buy preference shares and issue shares to the public like Barclays.
