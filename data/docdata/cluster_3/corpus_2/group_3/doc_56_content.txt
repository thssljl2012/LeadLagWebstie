         As far as I&amp;#039;m concerned this whole HBOS thing is a scandal.  The takeover of HBOS has clearly been forced on Lloyds &amp;amp;amp; the only reason it will get voted through is because the majority of Lloy shareholders (i.e. institutions) also own HBOS. The majority of private Lloy shareholders HATE the deal &amp;amp;amp; with good reaseon.  Prior to the forced HBOS takeover Lloy were bearing up OK (in the circumstances). I&amp;#039;m convinced they could have raised any money they needed in the same way that Barclays have. And today we would be looking at a very different shareprice &amp;amp;amp; a very different story.  Since the day the hbos deal was announced the perception of Lloy has utterly changed &amp;amp;amp; the shareprice has more than halved. How can that possibly be a good deal? How can that POSSIBLY be a deal that would get approved?  And the answer is that it certainly WOULDN&amp;#039;T be approved except for the fact that the Govt is forcing it through, aided &amp;amp;amp; abetted by the institutional shareholders. It&amp;#039;s a shotgun marriage.  Those of us who bought into Lloyds are going to end up with a small share in some monstrous debt-ridden quasi-nationalised bank with no prospect of &amp;amp;quot;shareholder value&amp;amp;quot; or dividends in sight.
