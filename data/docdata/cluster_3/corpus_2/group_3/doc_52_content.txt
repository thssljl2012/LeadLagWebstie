         Lloyds was one of the more conservative of the UK clearers.  So it&amp;#039;s hard to see exactly why they should need to raise 5.5bn in new capital, especially after the recent share placing (around 800m) and being able to save nearly 2bn a year by suspending the dividend.   OK, so it will suffer write downs from the effects of a housing downturn and bad unsecured retail debt.  All the same, does it really need to take advantage of the Governement scheme, when Barclays expects to raise a similar slug of new equity in the same manner.  My guess is this is all something of a gentlemen&amp;#039;s close-door deal.  That in reality most of that 5.5bn Government back equity is a back door way of lending support to HBOS.  In other words, out of the 17bn total being raised between Lloyds and HBOS, nearly all of it is actually required by the HBOS side.  What are the chances, after the dust settles, of LLoyds shareholders failing to approve the merger?  Methinks that at the end of the day the old-boys-network will prevail and the deal will go ahead.  But is still seems either a poor deal for LLoyds, or, arguably an inspired/dangerous punt that in a few years time the risks are worth the creation of a UK banking monlith able to extract profitability to match its dominant  position.
