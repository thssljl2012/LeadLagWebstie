         The UK Government will simply buy Preference shares in the same way as Warren Buffett did with Goldman Sachs recently! Are GS nationalised or bust? No! After the deal, GS shares went up, and RBS shares will probably soar as soon as soon as the Government makes the announcement as the market will stop the nonsense chatter about one of the big UK banks going bust.  There are few as bearish as me on RBS ordinary shares, but I do not think for one second RBS will ever go bust. At the very worst, the Government will buy Prefs, or HSBC will take it over, and with either of those options I would expect the shares to be far higher than they are now.  If these things do not happen however, RBS will simply drastically cut back its lending and hoard cash and capital until its capital ratio has risen to about 10%, and it can resume normal lending again. This could take years though as happened with the big banks in Japan. Nothing happens to the bank though, they still make profits, but much lower than in the boom years, and dividends will be much lower. The people who suffer from this lack of lending will of course be the companies who do not get credit and ordinary people who lose their jobs.  The mega banks like RBS and Barclays simply wait until the economy recovers again. We are not talking about Northern Rock and B&amp;amp;amp;B here! Global Banks like RBS and Barclays do not go bust!
