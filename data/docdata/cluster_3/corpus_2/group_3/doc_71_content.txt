          yes, something is afoot here. I have the feeling that HBOS shareholders are going to be well and truly shafted!     I&amp;#039;d rather Hbos shareholders got shafted than Lloyds ones frankly. I bought Lloyds for its relative dullness, I certainly didn&amp;#039;t want exposure to a racy institution such as Hbos.   When other banks are picking up the pieces relatively cheaply, Nomura with lehman, Barclays similarly the last thing you want is to overpay. Without the &amp;amp;quot;cushion&amp;amp;quot; of a lloyds bid HBos would either have been nationalised by now or be trading sub 40p.
