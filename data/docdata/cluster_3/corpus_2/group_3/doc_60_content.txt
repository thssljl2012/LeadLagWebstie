         Interesting that the recapitalisation of the banks has not mentioned HBOS, rather Lloyds, Barclays and RBS. Does this imply that the Govt is satisfied that a deal will take place, albeit at a probable lower price? Surely they wouldn&amp;#039;t go thru the process of injecting capital into the three banks only to have HBOS jilted by Lloyds.  Eagerly awaiting Darling&amp;#039;s appearance this morning  Z
