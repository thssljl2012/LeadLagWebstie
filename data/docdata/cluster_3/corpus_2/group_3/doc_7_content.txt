William Engdahl         Online Journal Contributing Writer               Oct 10, 2008, 00:30           Email this article          Printer friendly page         What&amp;#039;s clear from the behavior of European financial markets over the past    two weeks is that the dramatic stories of financial meltdown and panic are    deliberately being used by certain influential factions in and outside the    EU to shape the future face of global banking in the wake of the US subprime    and asset-backed security (ABS) debacle.      The most interesting development in recent days has been the unified and    strong position of the German chancellor, finance minister, Bundesbank and    coalition government, all opposing an American-style EU Superfund bank    bailout. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson pursues his crony    capitalism to the detriment of the nation and benefit of his cronies in the    financial world. It&amp;#039;s an explosive cocktail that need not have been.      Stock market falls of 7 to 10 percent a day make for dramatic news headlines    and serve to foster a broad sense of unease bordering on panic among    ordinary citizens. The events of the last two weeks among EU banks since the    dramatic state rescues of Hypo Real Estate, Dexia and Fortis banks, and the    announcement by UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling of a radical    shift in policy in dealing with troubled UK banks, have begun to reveal the    outline of a distinctly different European response to what in effect is a    crisis &amp;#039;Made in USA.&amp;#039;      There is serious ground to believe that US Goldman Sachs ex CEO Henry    Paulson, as Treasury secretary, is not stupid. There is also serious ground    to believe that he is actually moving according to a well-thought-out    long-term strategy. Events as they are now unfolding in the EU tend to    confirm that. As one senior European banker put it to me in private    discussion, &amp;#039;There is an all-out war going on between the United States and    the EU to define the future face of European banking.&amp;#039;      In this banker&amp;#039;s view, the ongoing attempt of Italian Prime Minister Silvio    Berlusconi and France&amp;#039;s Nicholas Sarkosy to get an EU common &amp;#039;fund,&amp;#039; with    perhaps upwards of $300 billion to rescue troubled banks, would de facto    play directly into Paulson and the US establishment&amp;#039;s long-term strategy, by    in effect weakening the banks and repaying US-originated asset backed    securities held by EU banks.      Using panic to centralize power      As I document in my forthcoming book, Power of Money: The Rise and Decline    of the American Century, in every major US financial panic since at least    the Panic of 1835, the titans of Wall Street -- most especially until 1929,    the House of JP Morgan -- have deliberately triggered bank panics behind the    scenes in order to consolidate their grip on US banking. The private banks    used the panics to control Washington policy, including the exact definition    of the private ownership of the new Federal Reserve in 1913, and to    consolidate their control over industry, such as US Steel, Caterpillar,    Westinghouse and the like. They are, in short, old hands at such financial    warfare to increase their power.      Now they must do something similar on a global scale to be able to continue    to dominate global finance, the heart of the power of the American Century.      That process of using panics to centralize their private power created an    extremely powerful, concentration of financial and economic power in a few    private hands, the same hands which created the influential US foreign    policy think-tank, the Council on Foreign Relations in 1921 to guide the    ascent of the American Century, as Time founder Henry Luce called it in a    pivotal 1941 essay.      It&amp;#039;s becoming increasingly obvious that people like Henry Paulson, who by    the way was one of the most aggressive practitioners of the ABS revolution    on Wall Street before becoming Treasury secretary, are operating on motives    beyond their over-proportional sense of greed. Paulson&amp;#039;s own background is    interesting in that context. Back in the early 1970s Paulson started his    career working for a notorious man named John Ehrlichman, Nixon&amp;#039;s ruthless    domestic adviser who created the Plumbers&amp;#039; Unit during the Watergate era to    silence opponents of the president, and was left by Nixon to &amp;#039;twist in the    wind&amp;#039; for it in prison.      Paulson seems to have learned from his White House mentor. As co-chairman of    Goldman Sachs, according to a New York Times account, in 1998 he forced out    his co-chairman, Jon Corzine &amp;#039;in what amounted to a coup.&amp;#039;      It is becoming clear Paulson, and his friends at Citigroup and JP Morgan    Chase, had a strategy, as did the godfather of asset backed securitization    and deregulated banking, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, as I have    detailed in my earlier series, Financial Tsunami, Parts I-V.      Knowing that at a certain juncture the pyramid of trillions of dollars of    dubious subprime and other high risk home mortgage-based securities would    come falling down, they apparently determined to spread the so-called &amp;#039;toxic    waste&amp;#039; ABS securities as globally as possible, in order to seduce the big    global banks of the world, most especially of the EU, into their honey trap.      They had help. In recent testimony under oath by Eric Dinallo, the    superintendent of the New York Insurance Departmen,t at the AIG bailout    oversight hearing into the AIG rescue by Paulson, Dinallo said that funding    cutbacks in recent years directed by the Bush-Cheney administration had    reduced the responsible department that should regulate or watch over the    $80 trillion in asset backed securities (ABS), which included the toxic    subprime and Alt-A mortgage securities and much more. The Bush    administration cut the staff of more than 100 people down to one -- yes that    was not a typo. One as in &amp;#039;uno.&amp;#039;      Was that just ideological budget cutting fervor, or was it deliberate? Was    former Goldman Sachs&amp;#039; man, the man who convinced the president to hire    Paulson, Bush&amp;#039;s former director of the Office of Management and Budget    (OMB), Joshua Bolten, now the president&amp;#039;s chief of staff, responsible for    insuring there was no effective government oversight of the exploding    securitization of mortgage assets?      These are perhaps some questions which the good congressmen ought to be    asking people like Henry Paulson and Josh Bolten, and not such red herring    questions as how large Richard Fuld&amp;#039;s bonus pay at Lehman was. Are Mr Bolten&amp;#039;s    fingerprints on the corpse here? And why is no one questioning the role of    Paulson as CEO of Goldman Sachs, then the most aggressive promoter of exotic    and other asset backed securitization products on Wall Street?      It now would appear that the Paulson strategy was to use a crisis -- a    crisis that was pre-programmed and predictable as far back as 2003 when Josh    Bolten became head of OMB -- when it exploded, to panic the more    conservative European Union governments into rushing to the rescue of US    toxic waste assets.      Were that to have happened, it would in the process destroy what was left of    sound EU banking and financial institutions, bringing the world one step    closer to a global money market controlled by Paulson&amp;#039;s cronies -- US-style    crony capitalism. Crony capitalism is certainly appropriate here. Paulson&amp;#039;s    predecessor at both Goldman Sachs and at Treasury, Robert Rubin, liked to    accuse the Asian bankers of Thailand, Indonesia and other lands hit with the    speculative attacks of US-financed hedge funds in 1997 of &amp;#039;crony capitalism,&amp;#039;    leaving the impression the crisis was homegrown in Asia and not the result    of a deliberate executed attack by US-financed financial institutions to    eliminate the Asia Tiger model among other goals, and turn Asia into the    funder of US debt.      Interesting to note is that Rubin is now a director of Citigroup, obviously    one of Paulson&amp;#039;s crony bank &amp;#039;survivors,&amp;#039; and the bank which to date has had    to write off the largest sum in toxic waste securitized assets.      If the allegation of preplanned panic, a la the Panic of 1907, is accurate,    and it is a big if, then the plan worked . . . up to a point. That point    came over the weekend of October 3, coincidentally the national unification    holiday of Germany.      Germany breaks with US model      In closed door talks well into the evening of Sunday October 5, Alex Weber    the hard-nosed head of the Bundesbank, BaFin head Jochen Sanio and    representatives of the Berlin coalition government of Chancellor Merkel came    up with a rescue package for Hypo Real Estate of a nominal ?50 billion.    However, behind the dramatic headline number, as Weber pointed out in a    September 29 letter to Finance Minister Peer Steinbrck that has been made    public, not only did the private German banks have to come up with 60    percent of that figure, the state with 40 percent. But also, given the    careful manner in which the government, in cooperation with the Bundesbank    and BaFin, structured the rescue credit agreement, the maximum possible    loss, in a worst case scenario, to the state would be limited to ?5.7    billion, not ?30 billion as many believed. It&amp;#039;s still real money but not the    blank check for $700 billion that a US Congress under duress and a few days    of falling stock market prices agreed to give Paulson.      The swift action by Finance Minister Steinbrck to fire the head of HRE, in    stark contrast to Wall Street where the same criminal fraudsters remain at    their d...
