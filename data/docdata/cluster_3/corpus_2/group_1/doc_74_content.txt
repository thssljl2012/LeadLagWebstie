      Quote:                         Totally agree. Are they trying to tell us there was twice as much sold during the same period? And are we to believe that Barclays could actually round up @6,000,000 ounces in a few days when we can&amp;#039;t find any?                     I have to confess - I sold half my silver to them.  That&amp;#039;s why the price dropped so much too.  Sorry guys.
