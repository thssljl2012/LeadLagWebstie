         Hi Paul,  Yes, it is possible to move the cash to tracker, but remember you only have an allowance of 7,200 for the whole year - you can put that whole allowance into the stocks and shares part or up to 3,600 into cash and the remainder into stocks and shares. So, if you put the full cash allowance of 3,600 into the cash part and moved it across to the stocks and shares part, you cannot put anything else into Cash until the next tax year, although you would be able to put 3,600 more into the stocks and shares one (provided you hadn&amp;#039;t already use your allowance).  In terms of whether you should go for a high interest  savings account  or an ISA, it depends how much cash you have. If it is just the 3,600, you may as well go for a Cash ISA - there are some really high paying ones at the moment - the barclays tax haven isa ( http://www.personal.barclays.co.uk/BRC1/jsp/brccontrol?site=...  is offering 6.25% and the Icesave ( http://www.fairinvestment.co.uk/icesave_cash_isas.aspx)  is offering 6.1%.   IF you have more cash to put away, you may as well make use of an ISA and then open a high interest  savings account  anyway - Martin Lewis is suggesting the Kaputhing ( http://www.fairinvestment.co.uk/kaupthing_savings_account.as...  is offering 6.55%. Icesave&amp;#039;s is a better rate - 7.06% - but you have to put 1,000 as the opening deposit where as with Kaputhing it is 100.  Hope that helps!
