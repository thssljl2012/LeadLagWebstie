 In the end it comes down to what the publication styles guide says. For example the Economist (   Research Tools   Economist.com   Economist.com   ) says            Quote:                         Use the ending  s&amp;#039;  on plurals that end in  s  Danes&amp;#039; ,  bosses&amp;#039; ,  Joneses&amp;#039; including plural names that take a singular verb, eg,  Reuters&amp;#039; ,  Barclays&amp;#039; ,  Stewarts &amp;amp;amp; Lloyds&amp;#039; ,  Salomon Brothers&amp;#039;                        The United States&amp;#039;s president sounds silly.
