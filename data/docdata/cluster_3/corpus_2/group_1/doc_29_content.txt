  http://www.crainsmanchesterbusiness....administration     5:00 am, August 11, 2008    Two more Issa firms put into administration  Developer loses control of all Manchester projects  By Simon Binns      Another two companies that form part of Bashar Issa&amp;#039;s Manchester-based development firm BSC Group have been placed into administration.    Issa Developments Ltd, which owns the Sarah Tower site on Dale Street in Manchester city centre, and BS Developments Ltd, which owns the partially-completed Sarah Point development on nearby Great Ancoats Street, are both in the hands of David Costley-Wood at the Manchester office of KPMG.    KPMG is already running BS Construction Ltd, which went into administration in May and owns the Issa Quay serviced apartment site, also on Dale Street in Manchester. That company owed Barclays Bank 11.5m along with 2m to unsecured creditors.    Sarah Tower, opposite Issa Quay on Dale Street, was intended for use as a hotel after initial attempts to market is as a 35m residential tower comprising 130 apartments fell flat.    Sarah Point, also estimated to be worth 35m by BSC Group, had proposed 140 apartments, a health clinic and retail. It had been funded by Yorkshire Bank.    The new administrations mean Issa has now been relieved of all four of his Greater Manchester projects, following Anglo Irish Bank&amp;#039;s decision to withdraw its funding for BSC Group&amp;#039;s Canopus Greengate scheme in Salford.    David Clifton at the Manchester office of Knight Frank has been instructed to dispose of Sarah Point, and has already carried out several viewings with potential buyers. Possible options for the site include a mixed-use residential and serviced apartment scheme or a rental-only residential complex, according to sources.    Knight Frank is also expected to win the instruction for Sarah Tower.    Andy Finch, partner at the Manchester office of Knight Frank, told Crain&amp;#039;s the Sarah Point site, despite being partially complete, was in a state of disrepair, which had raised concerns among some viewers.    &amp;amp;#8220;It&amp;#039;s in a bit of a mess,&amp;amp;#8221; he said. &amp;amp;#8220;There are some concerns about the quality of workmanship and whether the structure as it stands has actually been built to the right standards and regulations. It&amp;#039;s something we&amp;#039;ll have to look at, although there has been interest in the site and there are a few options on what it could be used for.&amp;amp;#8221;    One creditor of BS Construction, who asked not to be named but is owed more than 10,000, said the new administrations may mean a better chance of getting some money back.    &amp;amp;#8220;We&amp;#039;re not owed a huge sum, but for people owed tens of thousands, it must be devastating,&amp;amp;#8221; he said. &amp;amp;#8220;There are a lot of small companies out there owed money by the group.&amp;amp;#8221;    Issa is currently trying to secure a refinancing deal with London-based finance house Gresham. It is not known whether the collapse of the two companies will affect negotiations but sources familiar with discussions said that any deal with Gresham was now looking &amp;amp;#8220;unlikely&amp;amp;#8221;.    Gresham Ltd and KPMG declined to comment. Issa failed to respond to calls for comment.
