        The acquisition, by a rival bank in Little Rock, was arranged by another part of the F.D.I.C. The team was careful to camouflage their identity in the days leading up to the seizure.  Mr. Holloway and his colleagues used personal credit cards, rather than cards provided by the F.D.I.C., to avoid detection. If anybody asked why they were in town, they were told to say that they were with the Toy Shop on business, he said.  It is kind of cloak and dagger, Mr. Holloway said. You dont want to start a run on the bank.  From the seizure on Friday until ANB Bank reopened all its branches on Monday for customers under the Pulaski name, it was continuous work.  Mr. Holloway and five colleagues huddled in the banks loan office in St. George, Utah. Two-thirds of ANBs loans had been made in Utah.   I was the asset manager, and the biggest assets were in Utah, he said.  They also had offices in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Idaho Falls, Idaho. So we consolidated them.    lol...don&amp;#039;t i know it....  sniffed this one out when i went to an open house back in feb and no one showed up, spent about an hour with the realtor, and asked who the hell is funding this building explosion?  he said some bank in based out little rock (walmart apparently had a big stake in the bank)...  and walla!  4 months later, ANB implodes &amp;amp;lt;g&amp;amp;gt;
