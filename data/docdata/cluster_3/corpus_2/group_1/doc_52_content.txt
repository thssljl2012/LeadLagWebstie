Did you ever consider that&amp;#039;s exactly why we can&amp;#039;t find any? Perhaps all the smaller investment size silver and scrap silver has been converted to 1000-ounce bars.  This is the speculation of my local dealer.    I&amp;#039;m not concerned about their inventory.  I think the signs are here that there is going to be an explosive upward move in the spot price within the next six months.
