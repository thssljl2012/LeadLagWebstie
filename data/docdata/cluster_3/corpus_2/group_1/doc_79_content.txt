         Does anyone know who I contact about some old Winterthur Shares that I inherited when Winterthur bought out the Colonial Mutual Group.  I have tried to contact Winterthur themselves but they just keep sending me to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia who then send me to further companies. I can&amp;#039;t seem to get any information from anyone!  many thanks lindamartin
