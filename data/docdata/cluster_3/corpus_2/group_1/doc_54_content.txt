 A month ago I thought that things were going to get bad for SBM... due to three 5% plus holders all selling below the 5% reporting radar, which meant they could keep selling about 80mill shares (rough guess) each.

The other bad news is that Merrill Lynch has also been a net seller, (added to AMP and Barclays) though I have now idea how to read all that stock loaning and returning stuff - it looks like someone in NY has been playing - and losing on this one (but that is a superficial reading of the data).      Anyway all of this actually says 2 things to me - hold on they can&amp;#039;t sell forever - things maybe worse with the financials than we realise which is good for gold, but bad for people and the world at large.   ...   caveat: NFA - DYOR                                             My take on this would be that there are some major players hurting and are forced to keep selling out and other small players who have been hit with increasing margin calls or sell out. Merrill Lynch is my guess for the hurting giant. There is news about that they are selling out of their CDO&amp;#039;s which is linked to why NAB have written down (orwas it off ... I&amp;#039;m not following it) their CDO exposure of about $890m. So if Merrill Lynch is hurting bad and near the edge of collapse that would explain why there is selling at any price. In other markets buyers would jump in, but in this market my guess is that there is so much uncertainty about that the big money is sitting on the sidelines.      I doubled up at about 0.35c and am considering going again if it hits 16c.      All of the above is guess work, it ain&amp;#039;t financial advice. Any others who want to try telling the tale of the ever sinking SBM price I&amp;#039;d love to hear it.
