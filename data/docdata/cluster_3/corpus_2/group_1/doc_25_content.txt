The biggest direct shareholder is Steve Jobs with 5,546,451 shares.                      Last I heard, Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal owned about 5% of Apple. He bought in about ten years ago -- so the amount of money he made is almost unfathomable. Not sure if he still owns the Apple shares or whether he turned them into a solid gold mansion.
