       AIG is running ads here saying you can save over $300 annually on auto insurance from them over geico....(first AIG ad i&amp;#039;ve ever seen)  they&amp;#039;re scrambling  just like my theory that the banks with the worst balance sheets are offering the highest CD and savings rates, i think the insurance co&amp;#039;s with the worst balance sheets will be offering the steepest discounts on coverage....
