Four large investors, Standard Life, Legal &amp;amp;amp; General, M&amp;amp;amp;G and Insight, are to sub-underwrite about 145m of the issue.   ..  Let&amp;#039;s face it -  every  major bank will be &amp;#039;successful&amp;#039; in raising money because the government will make sure they get the cash they need                      120m and 145m seems like beer money compared to the bail-out from the BOE.    The BOE &amp;amp;quot;gives&amp;amp;quot; 50(or is that 100) billions to british bank and then the same banks are asked to underwrite B&amp;amp;amp;B.  You couldn&amp;#039;t make it up.  The government may as well nationalise B&amp;amp;amp;B. It would be a hell of lot cheaper.
