         Carcosa  If I recall correctly, Lloyds increased their last dividend.   They did indeed.  My aside  (- has Barclays taken a leaf out of Lloyds TSB&amp;#039;s book ?)   was meant in the sense of when the going gets tough, as it did for Lloyds several years ago, the company maintains its dividend to shareholders.   The only problem with this policy/strategy of holding the dividend is that the doomsters (aka analysts) will continually harp on about its unsustainability; resulting in a depressed shareprice. However, the resultant, dependable high yield will confirm its status as a HYP candidate.   I suppose one of the doomsters will soon be along to ask &amp;#039;but is it sustainable?&amp;#039;.
