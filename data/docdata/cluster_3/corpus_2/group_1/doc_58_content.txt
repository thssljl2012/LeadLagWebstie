Gold and silver are easily manipulated via the futures markets (delayed delivery) and the ETFs e.g. GLD, SLV (products of JP Morgan and Barclays who are sworn enemies of precious metals). If only 10% of these ETF holders sell their shares and buy the physicals instead, we will see gold double in a hurry. It is a paper game. We are adding physicals but it is getting harder to get. Currently we cannot buy silver eagles, 100oz bars or the 40% clad silver bags. There is no supply. The takedown in gold/silver smack of desperation. Physical gold/silver is the counterplay of paper money.      Back to your question, the dollar is more easily manipulated than gold/silver as they are pure paper. They get help from countries with dollar pegs who erroneously are looking back to the past but they too will bail out some time in the near future. All currencies right now are being pumped up. Inflation (stagflation) is worldwide. There is no currency that is backed by gold although the Euro keeps a percentage peg of valuation to gold. The Euro benefits from a rising gold price and adjusted quarterly. You can see the relationship from charts.      It is possible to have these insane market manipulations close to elections. But after elections where there is no political will to intervene, the main trend should resume with renewed vigor. The current time is not a time to think the dollar has bottomed. This is an opportunity to diversify out of dollar holdings and add gold, silver or at least Euros to your portfolio. The volatility will keep you on the edge of your seat if you are not a multi timeframe trader so just go into accumulation mode and buy incrementally on pivot points (a reversal off a major dip).      The scenario is stagflation with possible hyperinflation for the USA. All these scenarios eventually end up in a depression. It will shake the world and come up with new leaders. It is a very exciting and dangerous time we live in.
