 DPTR Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 6              Re: Speculation   Theodore Butler, a silver expert, who watches the CFTC, says that SemGroup of Tulsa, a pipeline, storage and trading company, revealed in bankruptcy papers that the company had a $3 billion loss on short futures crude oil contracts. Per Butler, in order for SemGroup to lose this amount, they had to have a 100,000 contract position, or be short on about $15 billion of crude oil. Butler believes that SemGroup&amp;#039;s position, being forcibly bought back by their lead broker (said to be Barclays), may have alone accounted for the last $15 - $20 of the oil price increase and that a buying void created when this position was finally closed could have caused a good part of the initial $20 fall in crude prices. Butler&amp;#039;s position is that, in a variety of the markets the CFTC is supposed to regulate, they simply don&amp;#039;t do their job.      thread start
