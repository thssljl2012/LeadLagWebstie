No, I do not own it and had not been checking it out lately as a value play or dividend stock.     For the first many years of my professional life, I was in the Property/Casualty insurance business, first as a company employee and then as an independent agent. I interviewed with AIG way back in 1978. Did not take the job, but that&amp;#039;s a long story. I wound up working for them in 1985 for one year.l    Anyway AIG is a stock I have followed since at least 1985. Never bought it because of the low dividend, then always wished I had bought it. When the bad news started coming out a few years ago and Hank Greenberg left, I did not buy because the wheels did seem to be coming off.     That being said, I know as someone who spent many years in the industry that AIG is THE premier international insurance company. Bumps and bruises along the way notwithstanding, they are a huge player in the international insurance market. They may be down, but I seriously doubt they will ever be out. As some of us have joked in the past during the consolidation and mergers in the industry, one day there may be just be two insurance companies: AIG and Travelers. That&amp;#039;s an exaggeration, of course, but no one in the business expects AIG to be gone one day.    I am definitely putting this one on my list now that you brought the dividend to my attention. I have a friend who still works for them and I will call him to see if he can share any insight into why the drop this year from the high to the present price. All financials have taken a hit (ask me how I know) but this one seems to have been punished more than some. My guess is that they somehow got involved in the subprime mess. Not something you would expect a Property/Casualty insurance company to do.    Thanks again for the note on this one.      thread start
