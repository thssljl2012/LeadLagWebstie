 DPTR Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Re: Speculation    &amp;quot;Butler believes that SemGroup&amp;#039;s position, being forcibly bought back by their lead broker (said to be Barclays), may have alone accounted for the last $15 - $20 ...&amp;quot;    &amp;amp;nbsp;    One other point about this is that the position was closed out after the price of oil went above $125.00. Butler believes that the unwinding of the short added $15 to $20 to worldwide oil prices. But what he does not comment on is what the price would have been without the massive short.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;Did the shorting delay the price spike above $140? Without the massive shorting, would the price of oil have peaked at a much higher value such as $160?&amp;amp;nbsp;     &amp;amp;nbsp;    In other words, if SemGroup would not have shorted, would the price of oil have risen even higher than it did? My guess is that it would have. By delaying the price spike, it took a lot of momentum out of the run and they began covering as people were exiting.     &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;         thread start
