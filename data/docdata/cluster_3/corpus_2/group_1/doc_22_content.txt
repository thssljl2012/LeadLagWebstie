         &amp;amp;lt;What is not to like here?&amp;amp;gt;  I wasn&amp;#039;t able to find either American General Finance Corporation or the bond number, 02639EQD9, you posted, on Morningstar or Yahoo or QuantumOnLine.  I always check out the corporate financial statements, before investing, to make sure they look viable for the bond&amp;#039;s holding period.  I don&amp;#039;t like that I can&amp;#039;t find them.  Do you have a link? Is American General Finance Corporation the same as AIG, the troubled insurance giant?  Wendy
