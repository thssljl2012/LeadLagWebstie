 Offshore Sportsbooks &amp; Online Sports Picks  well see if markets can fend off AIG in AH like they did FRE today    JP&amp;#039;s 1320 all they can hope for comment from yesterday looking spot on IMO    ----------------------------------------     Aug. 6 (Bloomberg) -- American International Group Inc., the world&amp;#039;s biggest insurer, may post second-quarter results that are close to break-even after writedowns tied to the U.S. housing slump cut into earnings from insurance.    AIG probably will say later today that net income fell 97 percent to $148.9 million, according to the average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The New York-based company has been battered by losses from contracts sold to protect fixed- income investors amid the subprime mortgage market collapse.    Chief Executive Officer Robert Willumstad has said there are ``no sacred cows&amp;#039;&amp;#039; in his three-month review of AIG units as he tries to reverse a 51 percent stock slide this year and net losses in the past two quarters totaling $13 billion. Willumstad, 62, replaced Martin Sullivan June 15 after investors including former CEO Maurice ``Hank&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Greenberg demanded Sullivan&amp;#039;s ouster.    ``If writedowns wipe out earnings for a third quarter in a row,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; AIG may drop another 20 percent in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, said Keith Wirtz, who helps oversee $23 billion, including 1.3 million AIG shares, as chief investment officer of Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati. ``There&amp;#039;s the risk that the new guy lays everything down on the table from his predecessor.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;    The insurer may post as much as $7 billion of second-quarter writedowns for credit-default swaps on top of about $20 billion in losses from previous quarters, Wachovia Corp. analyst John Hall said in a July 15 research note.    ``We don&amp;#039;t see near-term relief in sight&amp;#039;&amp;#039; for AIG&amp;#039;s swaps, as securities linked to the derivatives lost value, Hall said. He cut AIG to ``market perform&amp;#039;&amp;#039; from ``outperform&amp;#039;&amp;#039; last month.    Subprime Loans    AIG&amp;#039;s financial products unit responsible for the swaps guaranteed more than $460 billion of assets for fixed-income investors at the end of March, including $60.6 billion in securities tied to subprime mortgages.    The insurer declined $1.17, or 3.9 percent, to $28.72 at 9:31 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    There are ``key question marks&amp;#039;&amp;#039; concerning AIG&amp;#039;s risk controls, Societe Generale SA analyst Emmanuelle Cales said in a research note dated today. The firm started coverage of AIG with a ``sell&amp;#039;&amp;#039; rating.    ``We do not see how AIG could quickly reduce its large exposure to the subprime market,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Cales said.    The biggest insurers in the U.S. and Bermuda have posted more than $77 billion in writedowns linked to the collapse of the mortgage market since the start of 2007, with AIG representing about half that total, data compiled by Bloomberg show.    Raising Capital    AIG raised $20.3 billion in May by selling debt and equity to replenish capital and protect against further writedowns. Citigroup Inc. analyst Joshua Shanker said in a research note that month that AIG may seek $10 billion more.    Catastrophe costs and slipping returns from hedge funds may also weigh on AIG&amp;#039;s results. Natural disasters in the U.S., including a record number of tornadoes, cost insurers about $6.03 billion in the second quarter, the most since 2001, according to Insurance Services Office Inc. Allstate Corp., the largest publicly traded U.S. home and auto insurer, said second-quarter profit plunged 98 percent to $25 million on storm costs and investment losses.    Earnings from private equity and hedge fund holdings were probably close to zero in the second quarter after returns fell 84 percent to $197 million in the period ended March 31, Shanker said. AIG had $29.4 billion of so-called ``alternative&amp;#039;&amp;#039; holdings as of March 31.    Hedge Funds    Allstate, Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. and Lincoln National Corp. all said second-quarter returns from such investments declined by more than 60 percent.    AIG named former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Vice Chairman Suzanne Nora Johnson to the board last month to help restore investor confidence. Shareholders including billionaire Eli Broad pressured Willumstad to bolster leadership at the company.    Richard Holbrooke, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and Ellen Futter, president of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, resigned from the board.    Willumstad, who&amp;#039;s also AIG&amp;#039;s chairman, has said he&amp;#039;ll meet with unit heads, business partners and regulators to get a better feel for the company, which has $1 trillion of assets, 116,000 employees and operations in more than 100 countries.    Mortgage Lending    AIG, the largest insurer by assets, said June 17 that its Wilmington Finance Inc. unit will stop originating mortgages through brokers and reduce the number of loans it makes directly to homebuyers during the worst U.S. housing slump since the Great Depression.    The United Guaranty mortgage insurance division may be unprofitable this year, AIG has said. Mortgage insurers pay lenders when homeowners default and foreclosures don&amp;#039;t cover costs. In June, 67,908 insured borrowers fell at least 60 days delinquent industrywide, compared with 43,214 who got out of arrears, according to the Washington-based Mortgage Insurance Companies of America.    AIG is struggling with writedowns as prices decline industrywide for commercial insurance. Rates in the U.S. fell 13 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier as insurers cut prices to win market share, according to a survey by the Council of Insurance Agents &amp;amp;amp; Brokers in Washington.    Ten analysts recommend investors accumulate shares of AIG, eight have ``hold&amp;#039;&amp;#039; ratings, and none say ``sell,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; according to Bloomberg data through yesterday.
