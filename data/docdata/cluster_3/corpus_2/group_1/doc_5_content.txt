      Quote:                         It was my bank, Barclays, that have recommended this to me but I was thinking of applying direct.                     Barclays will be full cost. Going direct doesnt get you much of a discount either. You need a discount IFA (or local IFA that does execution only) to get the best deal.          Quote:                         Why is it more expensive to apply direct?                     They keep the commission that they would have paid to the IFA or multi-tied provider for themselves. Also, they only quote default commission and not enhanced commission (commission rate has no impact on your charges so an IFA getting enhanced commission and rebating gives you better terms).          Quote:                         Barclays have told me that there is no set up fee and they will not be taking any cut of the fund.                      That is not quite correct. There is no initial charge. However, if you use them (or any other full commission adviser) you will have an extra 0.5&amp;amp;#37; p.a. charge for the first 5 years on top of the normal annual management charge. The allocation rate will also be around 102.5% (compared to around 107% on discounted terms).     NU pay Barclays but NU recover the charges from the investment. The higher the commission (upto standard) the greater the annual charge. If some of the commission is rebated then the charges reduce.     Never ever get your advice from a bank or building society. Even if they are multi-tied or whole of market. Its a salesforce. They work on maximum commission and the products they retail have higher charges usually than the IFA version.  They also have sales targets and sales managers putting pressure on them.  Its not the environment to seek advice (hence why banks have more complaints than any other distribution arm).
