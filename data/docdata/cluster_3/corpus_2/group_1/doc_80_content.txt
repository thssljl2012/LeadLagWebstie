Similar to the electrification of Leeds NW, routes east of Leeds will be electrified (not too far away in the future). That is to York, Selby and the ECML. It is in order to create the horseshoe plan that would relieve the busy Doncaster-Leeds line.                      Plans are one thing,money is another.   That route is pretty busy,the line speed is 75 mph (between Micklefield Jcn and Hambleton West Jcn,its a poor rail head and is slippy as chuff in bad weather.   Not really the ideal rail for intercity travel,so the track would need a serious upgrade as well as the implementation of OHL.   Would it not be easier to have hybrid rolling stock that could travel from Neville Hill west Jcn to Hambleton South jcn where the current OHL comes in,then pan up and go on electric?      The real advantage of this set up is that if there is any OHL problem at any point along ANY route then hybrid rolling stock can pan down and carry on with far less disruption for passengers,TOC and railtrack ,it would be without doubt the best option,regardless of the cost of oil .   PLUS,the Dft would actually make money for the government coffers by the leasing out of the rolling stock to the various TOCs,the current owners of the rolling stock make an awful lot of money from what they currently lease.
