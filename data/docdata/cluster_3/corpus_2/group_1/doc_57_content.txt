 Stock Tips   http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?p...PQY&amp;amp;amp;refer=home        Aug. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac tumbled in New York trading to their lowest levels in more than 17 years on concern the government will be forced to bail out the mortgage- finance companies, wiping out common stockholders.      Fannie slid 22 percent, while Freddie dropped 25 percent after Barron&amp;#039;s reported that the Bush administration is anticipating the government-chartered companies will fail to raise the equity they need to offset credit losses, prompting the U.S. Treasury to act. The companies&amp;#039; stock market values are well below the minimum of $10 billion in capital that each would need to raise to ``have any credibility,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Barron&amp;#039;s said in its story.      ``We agree with the call for Treasury intervention and think it is very, very likely to happen before the end of the third quarter,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Ajay Rajadhyaksha, the head of fixed income strategy for Barclays Capital Inc., said in a telephone interview today. ``Without government help, we think there is very little chance of Freddie completing a significant capital raising.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      The government plans to recapitalize Fannie and Freddie with taxpayer money should their capital raising fail, Barron&amp;#039;s said, citing a person in the Bush administration it didn&amp;#039;t identify. A rescue of the companies, which own or guarantee 42 percent of the $12 trillion in U.S. home loans, would include preferred stock with a seniority, dividend preference and convertibility that would wipe out common stockholders, Barron&amp;#039;s reported.
