 Stock Tips  continued....      Highlighting Problems       Fannie&amp;#039;s market value has shrunk to $6.47 billion and Freddie&amp;#039;s declined to $2.7 billion, making it increasingly difficult for the companies to raise equity through public markets, Miller said. The companies have reported a combined $14.9 billion of net losses the past four quarters.        After receiving authority last month to inject unlimited capital into Fannie and Freddie, a Treasury spokeswoman this week said Paulson had no plans to use his new power .    I would beg to differ.       Initial optimism that Paulson&amp;#039;s proposal would bolster confidence in the companies has vanished on concern that the deteriorating housing market may force a bailout, a move that would likely wipe out common shareholders and potentially some preferred stockholders, Miller said.        ``It hasn&amp;#039;t restored any faith, it just highlighted their problems,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Miller said. ``The market has come to accept the fact that the government has got to do something.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;       Freddie&amp;#039;s 5.57 percent perpetual preferred shares are trading at $9.37 to yield 15.3 percent, compared with $17.99 and a yield of 7.77 percent on June 30 before the crisis erupted. Fannie&amp;#039;s 5.5 percent preferred shares yield 16.4 percent, up from 7.83 percent on June 30.       Roosevelt&amp;#039;s Creation       Fannie was created as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt&amp;#039;s New Deal in the 1930s and became a publicly owned company in 1968. Freddie was started in 1970 during the Vietnam War, primarily as competition for Fannie.       The companies, which own or guarantee about $5 trillion of the $12 trillion of outstanding U.S. home loans, help expand financing to homebuyers by purchasing home loans from lenders and packaging other loans into securities that they then guarantee.        The companies, which have a combined $1.7 trillion in outstanding unsecured debt , issue new debt to pay off outstanding obligations as they mature. The companies can also sell securities to raise cash.       `Aggressive&amp;#039;       ``While the plan was extraordinarily aggressive, it seems that the market is looking for something even more explicit and more guidance about what form that will take,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Margaret Kerins, the managing director of agency debt strategy at RBS Greenwich Capital Markets in Greenwich, Connecticut.       Freddie had $70 billion of cash and non-mortgage investments on June 30 and $470 billion of agency mortgage securities that it could pledge for secured borrowing, the company said Aug. 6.       Fannie paid a record high yield in a $3.5 billion sale of three-year benchmark notes last week that drew less demand from Asia. Investors in the region bought 22 percent of the offering, almost half the demand of three months ago and about two-thirds of Asia&amp;#039;s usual purchases.       ``The 22 percent of Asian participation is worrying,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, the head of fixed-income strategy for Barclays Capital in New York.       Freddie&amp;#039;s latest auction of short-term notes attracted less interest from investors for the second straight week.       Freddie this week said it sold $4 billion of short-term notes in a weekly auction, where investors bid for 2.19 times the amount of three-month securities available, down from 2.73 times last week.  The bid-to-cover ratio on the company&amp;#039;s six- month securities was 2.42 times, down from 2.92 times, while the ratio on 12-month debt sold was fell to 1.75 times, from 2.50.        This is good reporting.             Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  bigbull                         At what cost?.
