I&amp;#039;ve worked for NatWest, Barclays and now Lloyds. I&amp;#039;ve recruited for HSBC on top of that. They&amp;#039;re all much of a muchness. Fine while you abide by the rules, but all crap when you&amp;#039;re in trouble. Have to say Lloyds would be my preference, especially where business is concerned. Their cautious approach to lending has seen a lower level of write offs and a far more secure and stable platform.      I&amp;#039;d meet Business managers from a couple and go with who feels best. Enquire as to the turn over of business managment staff, as relationship building is key. Once satisfied with the business arrangements, stick your personal accounts there too. Retail banking is identikit across the board.       Natwest- Give you an umbrella when the sun shines, then take it away when it rains.      Don&amp;#039;t be swayed by deposit account interest rates, they&amp;#039;re largely irrelivent.
