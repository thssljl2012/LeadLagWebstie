 Hi all:      hope we all make profit in MRE in the long run.      A friend of mine is running a factory producing sulphuric acid, he has just had this industry seminar based in China. people in the seminar all rekon that the sulphur price is going to drop in the next half year, mainly because china is going to decrease the amont of fertilizer produced aiming environmental improvement. this will drag down the sulphur price.      just wondering why there is almost nothing about MRE on AFR? and since Barclays has increased holding in MRE again, there must be a strategic reason to invest more in MRE. personally i am willing to hold MRE for long term investment, but i think in short term my account is going to be in red....      Half year report is due 20/08/08, hope it will impress us.      Happy trading to you all
