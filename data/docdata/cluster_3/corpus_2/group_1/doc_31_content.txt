          I am at retirement age and am seriously considering putting the majority of my assets into an inflation indexed lifetime annuity. The return on investment isn&amp;#039;t that great, but the security really appeals to me, and the payments would be adequate for my daily needs. Here is my question. HOW SAFE IS SAFE ? Annuities are considered to be very safe, but I have reservations. We live in a rapidly changing world. Will an insurance company that appears to be rock-solid today, still be rock-solid in 20 or 30 years, if I live that long? Thanks for your comments.   Please do a lot of research before you make this decision.  I have always been nervous about the solvency of even the best insurance companies and recent events with MBI and AIG and comments by Warren Buffett haven&amp;#039;t helped.  There may be options that will give you as good or better income with a little more ease of sleeping.  Dinkysue
