Shares fell 8.2 percent in extended trading.     The loss in the period ended June 30 equaled $2.06 a share, compared with profit of $4.28 billion, or $1.64, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. The loss excluding the declines in the value of some investments was $1.32 billion, or 51 cents a share, missing by $1.28 the average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.     ``They&amp;#039;re still dealing with the environment for credit- default swaps, which is very difficult,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Keith Wirtz, who helps manage $23 billion including 1.3 million AIG shares as chief investment officer of Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati. ``Investment income is being pressured.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;     Chief Executive Officer Robert Willumstad promised there are ``no sacred cows&amp;#039;&amp;#039; in his three-month review of AIG units as he tries to reverse a 50 percent stock slide this year and net losses in two previous quarters totaling $13 billion. Willumstad, 62, replaced Martin Sullivan June 15 after investors including former CEO Maurice ``Hank&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Greenberg demanded Sullivan&amp;#039;s ouster.     The insurer reduced the value of credit-default swaps, guarantees AIG sold to protect fixed-income investors, by $5.56 billion and marked down other holdings by $6.08 billion before taxes.     Housing Writedowns     The biggest insurers in the U.S. and Bermuda posted more than $77 billion in writedowns linked to the collapse of the mortgage market from the start of 2007 through the first quarter, with AIG representing about half that total.     AIG raised $20.3 billion in May by selling debt and equity to replenish capital and protect against further writedowns. Citigroup Inc. analyst Joshua Shanker said in a research note that month that AIG may seek $10 billion more.     The insurer fell $2.38 to $26.71 at 6:03 p.m. in New York. AIG is the second-worst performer this year in the Dow Jones Industrial Average behind General Motors Corp. Second-quarter results were announced after the close of regular trading today.     ``We have a lot of work to do to restore AIG&amp;#039;s profitability to where it should be,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Willumstad said in the statement. He said he&amp;#039;ll update investors on his turnaround plan next month.     AIG has other units affected by the worst U.S. housing slump since the Great Depression, including a mortgage insurer and home lender. The company said June 17 that its Wilmington Finance Inc. unit will stop originating mortgages through brokers and reduce the number of loans it makes directly to homebuyers.     Mortgage Insurance     AIG&amp;#039;s mortgage insurer, United Guaranty Corp., had an underwriting loss of $564 million, a fourfold increase from a year earlier. The unit, which reimburses lenders when borrowers don&amp;#039;t pay their loans, said 4.9 percent of policies were at least 60-days past due, almost double a year earlier.     The unit may be unprofitable through the middle of next year, the company said today. In June, 67,908 insured borrowers fell at least 60 days delinquent industrywide, compared with 43,214 who got out of arrears, according to the Washington-based Mortgage Insurance Companies of America.     AIG&amp;#039;s American General Finance lost $40 million as the home lender increased its allowance for loan losses and spent money to scale back its Wilmington Finance Inc. mortgage business. The unit earned a profit of $43 million in the same period a year earlier.     One in every 171 U.S. households was foreclosed on, received a default notice or was warned of a pending auction in the second quarter, said RealtyTrac Inc., double the rate of a year earlier.     -----------------------------    Keep in hibernation &amp;amp; just manage that portfolio NovaStar. Looks like Shorts are posting more on the board. They must be a little concerned that NovaStar had the best business plan &amp;amp; will make it thru another Mortgage crash. Maybe the write offs are over &amp;amp; we will see a profit for the quarter????????      Kirby
