           &amp;amp;quot;There have been highs and lows in bewtween but in hindsight would&amp;#039;nt we all rather have sold at 600p a share?  There is nothing noble in owning, buying, selling or holding a stock for a certain period. &amp;amp;quot;    Absolutely agree there&amp;#039;s nothing noble.  It&amp;#039;s just more practical.    &amp;amp;quot;Times change and so should the mentality of those buying stocks.&amp;amp;quot;    You mean, the share price has gone down so you should sell? And you should only buy when the share price has gone up?  To save time, I&amp;#039;ll pre-empt your response... &amp;#039; But the fundamentals of banking have changed. &amp;#039;  Have they? Here&amp;#039;s what Barclays have had to say regards the underlying fundamentals of the banking industry in the medium term...   &amp;amp;quot;But for all the impact of the difficult environment,  the medium term drivers of growth in the global financial services industry are substantially unchanged : the privatisation of welfare provision; wealth management and wealth transfer; the growth of retail banking in the developing world; the increasing use of capital markets for financing and risk management; the pursuit of yield by investors; and the demands on capital markets to fund infrastructure development - these sources of growth endure.&amp;amp;quot;   So for all the people apparently calling the banking sector correct... well, there were just as many claiming there was not problem.   And for all the people claiming that the banking industry has fundamentally changed... not all those at the coal face agree. (BTW Barclays managed 51% LTV on mortgages in the first half this year... WTF!!! It really doesn&amp;#039;t seem to me that the banks are in trouble... seems to me the banks are the ones controlling the current situation)    &amp;amp;quot;...but in hindsight would&amp;#039;nt we all rather have sold at 600p a share?&amp;amp;quot;    With hindsight (ignoring the fact my first purchase (toe in the water) was at 475p after it had dropped from 600p), yes absolutely without a doubt, I would have loved to sell at 600p.  The only problem is, take away the hindsight bit and I&amp;#039;m ****ed.   I tried to be clever and sell out of SGC, having bought at 55p, watched it go down to 12p (too fearful to buy anymore at that price... damn hindsight, where the heck is hindisght at the time you need it!!!), then sold out (with a smile and in profit) on the way up. Then watched with gritted teeth as it nearly double again, with me in cash watching from the sidelines.  Similar with BOS (Bodyshop) a few years back. I timed the buy brilliantly (the one time that my (intentional) timing of a purchase has proved spot on, but it was low liquidity, so these things were easy to spot). Unfortunately sold out at 107p thinking it was expensive having made a 60% return in a few months. Then watched through gritted teeth as it went up and up and up, till it was taken out well above (more than double* again) what I sold it for.   In my last 10years of investing, the one thing that I have learned is that I have a tendancy to sell too early. Had I still held all the shares I&amp;#039;d bought instead of trying to be clever and selling some and putting the money into others, I can definitely say without a shadow of a doubt that the current capital value of my portfolio would be  significantly  above where it is now. (And bear in mind that I didn&amp;#039;t jump (properly) into banks until they&amp;#039;d already fallen a substantial amount, so I&amp;#039;m not sitting on the same level of losses as some).  The few shares that I sold that did go on to perform worse, wouldn&amp;#039;t be enough to balance the gains from those that I sold that went on to perform better.  I&amp;#039;m pretty confident, however, that if I sell my bank shares now, I&amp;#039;ll be again looking at my portfolio again in a few years thinking to myself, damn I just didn&amp;#039;t learn, if only I still held those banks shares (probably while looking at the oil shares that I&amp;#039;d jump into instead, cursing myself through gritted teeth, why oh why didn&amp;#039;t I keep hold of those banks!!!)   - venice2001.  (* might have even been triple, but I can&amp;#039;t remember the takeover price off hand, but I know from bitterness that it would have been a 3 figure  additional to what I had already made  percentage profit in the space of a year or two, had I kept hold... in fact on my original buy price I think it would have been definitely over 400% profit, possibly over 600%. Still 60% was still good wasn&amp;#039;t it? &amp;amp;lt;blatant lie mode&amp;amp;gt; Oh yes, 60% was good&amp;amp;lt;/blatant lie mode&amp;amp;gt; GGRRRRRRRRR.)
