                                                     &amp;quot;If you want to bet against the US, go for it.&amp;quot;    Idon&amp;#039;twork, because you don&amp;#039;t work, you are living in dream land. Let&amp;#039;s us look at the US &amp;#039;INDUSTRIALS&amp;#039;  &amp;#039;S  DECLINE  one industrial at a time and one industry at a time.    1. Kodak - film and photography  2. Xerox - copying  3. Lucent - telephone switch gear etc.  4. Motorola - handphone sets  Vs. Nokia from a small EU nation.  5. GM, Ford, Crysler - auto  Vs. Toyota, Honda, Hyndai, VW etc.  6. All US airlines  except SW  Vs. SIA, Cathy Pacific, Quantas, BA.  7. Citigroup - once world&amp;#039;s biggest bank is now dwarfted by HSBC.  8. AIG - insurance - now our Manulife is bigger in market cap and much better managed.  9. Pficer - drugs - in decline  10. Fannie and Freddie - mortgage insurers - going, going, almost gone only backstopped by Uncle Sam.  11. MBIA - municipal bond insurer - going, going but not gone yet.    Imagine when the municipal bond insurers are on skaky grounds, what does that tell you on the status of the US municipal bonds; the balance sheets of the municipal governments?     When the US financials are in the shakest ground since the  great depression, what does that tell you on the financial status of the US borrowers at large?    The US economy is built on consumptions. Almost every level is spending money like a drunken sailor to keep the US economy afloot; but don&amp;#039;t forget, the drunken sailor is spending his own money. In boom times, not only there are no savings by the majority of the Joes, they borrowed to spend using the rising home equities courtesy of Allan Greenspan. Likewise, in boom times, the US is on budget deficit, current account deficit, and trade deficit. So what will happen in crunch times?    When Citigroup, Merril Lynch, Lehman Brothers, UBS, AIG etc. asked, &amp;quot; Brother, can you spare me$40 billion,  $10 billion, or even only $1 billion if you have&amp;quot;, the calls were only answered, by and large, outside the OECD in general and the US  in particular.  Why? The wealth has been transfered and the US money printing machine cannot print fast enoungh because time is of essence.    When Nokia from a small EU nation can beat Motorola from a giant industrial powerhouse by a HUGE MARGIN and when GM was once the industrial icon of the US and once the biggest company in the world and is on the point of going to ZERO in a couple of years, you know the US industrial power is in continual decline PERIOD.  Don&amp;#039;t you know there is such a thing as &amp;quot;The rise and fall of the Roman Empire&amp;quot;? No?
