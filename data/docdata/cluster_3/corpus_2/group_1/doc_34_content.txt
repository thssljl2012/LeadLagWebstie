          They (RBS) pretty much did the equivalent of purchasing the most expensive house in the most expensive road at the most stretched multiple from a self sert lender like Northern Rock at the peak of the largest property boom of all time. Result = instant negative equity - ie Writedowns.   Its an interesting thought ... Barclays cripples its rival RBS by letting them win an overpriced bidding contest. I wonder if there was an element of deliberately bidding up the price, knowing the psychology of the opponent wouldn&amp;#039;t let them be outbid !? As they say, lose the battle but win the war. It&amp;#039;d be amusing to see Barclays buying some distressed assets from RBS !
