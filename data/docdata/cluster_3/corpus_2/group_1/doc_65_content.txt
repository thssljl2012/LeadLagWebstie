          REVIEW OF THE PORTFOLIOS at 1 August   Here we go with a look at the portfolios as they stand at the close of play today. We&amp;amp;#8217;re 6 weeks into the challenge, and what an interesting 6 weeks! The performances of the folios have varied considerably in what has been a volatile market.  A quick reminder of what its all about:  Ten people came forward to run a capital protection strategy within the constraints I set out here:  http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11106642   The portfolios after trading on 20-Jun can be found here:  http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11110141   A summary review of the portfolios at 30-Jun can be found here:  http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11120355   Very brief &amp;amp;#8220;End of Week&amp;amp;#8221; summaries have been posted as follows: 04-Jul:  http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11126174  11-Jul:  http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11136559  18-Jul:  http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11146720  25-Jul:  http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11155175  1-Aug:  http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11163717     SOME PRELIMINARY DATA    A-Z of companies and % change 20-Jun to 1-Aug (mid-price to mid-price)   Barclays         +10.8 BP                -7.7                 Brit Am Tobacco   +5.0 British Land      -7.8 BT               -15.0                 Carnival          +2.7           GlaxoSmithKline   +6.6 HBOS              +7.1 HSBC              +4.9 ITV              -15.4 Kingfisher        +8.1 Legal &amp;amp; General   -9.3 Lloyds            -8.4             Marks &amp;amp; Spencer  -22.4    National Grid     -2.8      Old Mutual        -4.6 Pearson           +5.3 RBS               -1.8 Rexam             -5.9 Severn Trent      +2.2 Tate &amp;amp; Lyle       +3.8 Vodafone          -4.4 Wolseley         -23.7   Dividends paid to date   Tate &amp;amp; Lyle 16.10p (31-Jul)    REVIEW: PART 1 &amp;amp;#8211; THE PORTFOLIOS AS THEY CURRENTLY STAND    Portfolios: return on original investment at 1-Aug   Portfolio                              Return(%) ------------------------------------------------ THE HYP (BSDropout &amp;amp; TJH)                   -5.3 ------------------------------------------------ The HYP + Hedge (Lookingforclues)           +3.1 Banking on Banks (Valueinvestor)            -0.4      The Kings of Cash (Gengulphus &amp;amp; DorianEZJ)  -1.6 A Little Tweak (GAC)                        -1.8 The Analyser (FHPS)                         -2.8 The Dark Horse (68john)                     -6.8 The &amp;amp;#8220;jimsusan&amp;amp;#8221; (Janetsbears)               -11.0   The HYP   Company           Price(p)   No. Shares   Value() BP                 521.25      876        4566.15 Brit Am Tobacco   1812.00      286        5182.32 BT                 171.30     2456        4207.13 Carnival          1765.00      288        5083.20 GlaxoSmithKline   1172.00      450        5274.00 Lloyds             300.00     1511        4533.00 Marks &amp;amp; Spencer    263.25     1459        3840.82 National Grid      653.50      736        4809.76 Old Mutual          99.00     4768        4720.32 Pearson            655.50      795        5211.23 Rexam              376.75     1236        4656.63 Severn Trent      1358.00      372        5051.76 Tate &amp;amp; Lyle        388.50     1322        5135.97 Vodafone           137.65     3432        4724.15 Wolseley           339.75     1111        3774.62 Cash                                        54.43 Interest                                     0.19 Dividends                                  212.84  Total                                    71038.52 (-5.3%)   BSDropout  took the original HYP to run on a no-voluntary-tinker basis.   TJH  also took the original HYP, but to run using his normal tinkering criteria. So far, no tinkering triggered. ( Lookingforclues  is our third participant who took the original HYP, but in the one exception to the rules I allowed, opened the classic hedge of a sell-the-FTSE spreadbet. I&amp;amp;#8217;ll discuss lfc&amp;amp;#8217;s strategy later in the post.)  Commentary:  The HYP now stands at -5.6% compared to -1.0% on 20-Jun. Wolseley (-23.7%) and Marks &amp;amp; Spencer (-22.4%) did most of the damage with a bit of help latterly from BT (-15.0%). Wolseley has added insult to injury by announcing that it will not be paying a final dividend. On the positive side Tate &amp;amp; Lyle paid its final dividend on 31-Jul.

Commentary:  This portfolio currently has the poorest return by some way: -11.0% (compared to -2.8% on 20-Jun). The main problem seems to have been the holding in &amp;amp;#8230; er, Lloyds (-8.4%).

(68john, if you are around, it would be good if you could tell us something about your thinking behind the strategy.)  Commentary:  Joins the &amp;amp;#8220;jimsusan&amp;amp;#8221; as one of only two portfolios currently suffering a poorer return than the HYP. The &amp;amp;#8220;Dark Horse&amp;amp;#8221; is -6.8% compared to -1.9% on 20-Jun. The sale of 7 companies from the HYP and the buy of 7 new ones has not so far paid off: the 7 companies sold averaged a return of +0.2% during the period; the 7 companies bought averaged -1.2%.

He held the cash until 30-Jun when he invested it equally in BP, British American Tobacco, GlaxoSmithKline and Severn Trent. His strategy is based on TA and macro/sector analysis.  Commentary:  Current return is -2.8% compared with -1.5% on 20-Jun. Performance has been helped by the sale of the 7 HYP companies, which have since returned an average of -6.8%. The 4 companies which the proceeds were invested in have returned an average of +1.3% since the buy date.
