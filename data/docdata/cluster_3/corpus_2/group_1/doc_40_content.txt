I don&amp;#039;t agree. The credit crunch is &amp;amp;quot;entirely&amp;amp;quot; the result of a load of   foolish people buying property on microscopic (or even negative!)   margin which even a child of six could see was stupidly risky.      Except, of course, I don&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;s as simple as that. Lloyds bank   didn&amp;#039;t particularly get involved in the more risky and esoteric bits   of mortgage finance and lending. In 97 its share price was around 800.   It&amp;#039;s now 300. Barclays share price was around 400, it&amp;#039;s now 350. Even   UBS isn&amp;#039;t (yet) seeing the 10 year declines that Lloyds has. Some   people have made huge amounts of money backing Barclays and UBS that   they would have failed to do with Lloyds.         Lloyds bank got its fingers burnt very badly earlier by giving poorly  secured loans to South America, which it subsequently had to write off.  As a result it wasn&amp;#039;t in a good financial position to get involved in  dealing in some of the more recent financial instruments that have  proven to be of questionable value. I don&amp;#039;t think that Lloyds had better  foresight, I think they simply weren&amp;#039;t in a position to participate.
