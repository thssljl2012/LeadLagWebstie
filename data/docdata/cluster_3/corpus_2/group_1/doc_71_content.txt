          Since it&amp;#039;s argued that as the likes of Barclays made a profit then they should be &amp;amp;quot;windfall taxed&amp;amp;quot; can RBS shareholders look forward to a &amp;amp;quot;windfall tax refund&amp;amp;quot; as they made a loss?  Barclays makes fat profits by unfair charges, RBS is run by morons who should be forced to donate their personal assets to the bank&amp;#039;s coffers until such time as the bank can recover. Apple doesn&amp;#039;t have to abuse people to make a profit and neither do banks. Well run building societies have shown that. Banks have never had to play fair with the public as they are &amp;#039;too big to be allowed to fail&amp;#039; We managed to let the rotten car industry fail, so perhaps a few banking dinosaurs could be swept away to allow a new type of mutual bank, with government guarantees. I note the US&amp;#039;s Republicans are throwing money at subprime borrowers. Broon&amp;#039;s brand of socialism in a bizarre way is more right wing than Dubya, given that the millions in trouble with mortgages here are not being given any help.
