It  would take a position of that size going against you in order to  generate a $3 billion loss. How did the NYMEX and the CFTC allow  SemGroup to amass such a large position that it, obviously, couldnt  stand behind? What do these regulators do all day?          SemGroups  trading debacle influenced oil prices, first up, then down. As the end  came near for SemGroups large and increasing short position, that  position was forcibly bought back (probably by SemGroups lead broker,  said to be Barclays). By my calculations, this accounted for the last  $15 to $20 increase in the price of oil, up to the $147 price high.  When the forced buyback of the short position was concluded, a buying  void was suddenly created and prices then fell $20. So, not only did  SemGroup manage to lose over $3 billion and go bankrupt in the process,  it also dramatically influenced the price of oil.&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;       and regarding silver:       &amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;The  new COT indicates the big 4 are net short more than 175 days of world  mine production. The 8 largest traders are short 217 days compared to a  little over one days worth of oil production held short by SemGroup.  No commodity comes close, or has ever come close to having such a large  concentrated short position. In terms of the percentage of the total  COMEX silver futures market, the 8 largest traders hold 81% of the  entire short side, once all spreads are netted out. This is an  outrageous level of concentration.&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;       worth a look?             thread start
