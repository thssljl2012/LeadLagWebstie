 Thank you,      The area that I am looking at is: 3 bed, cheshire, 150 and I&amp;#039;m looking at 400 per month return.   Just looked at a few mortgages and Barclays for example:   Amount 120k   Deposit 50k   Over 30 years   Interest only is 527      What I think might be the best way, is to buy and sell at a profit, then build up enough to pay 3/4 of a mortgage then rent.  Then start over, that way I will be able to gain a profit from renting.
