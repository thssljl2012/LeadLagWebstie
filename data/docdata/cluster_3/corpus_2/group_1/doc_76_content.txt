 I&amp;#039;m not sure about the Visa debit card, but here are so many that can meet the other criteria:      Adelaide bank   AMP   ANZ   BankWest   Homeloans Limited   Homeside Lending   Pioneer   St George   Suncorp   Westpac      There&amp;#039;s lots of others, these are just the one&amp;#039;s that quickly come to mind.  The &amp;#039;best&amp;#039; lender will depend on lots of different factors.      For example:   I like Homeside because they&amp;#039;re backed by the NAB and have fairly low fees if it&amp;#039;s just one loan account.   I like Suncorp because you can have multiple offset accounts offsetting a single loan account (an account for holiday savings, an account for day to day transactions, etc).      The right product will depend on your circumstances.  Most offset accounts have most of the features you&amp;#039;ve asked for.
