Spreads aren&amp;#039;t great, not the worst but not the best, but pricing does seem fair when compared to 3000 Xtra.    Time will tell but I feel comfortable with them so far...    You&amp;#039;re on FXi, right?         It does come through Barc stockbrokers but they white label intergal&amp;#039;s power trader, which is an average platform. Barclays whitelables just about everything they do for their clients instead of building in house. The worst part is that Barclays&amp;#039; can offer a multibank feed but they dont to their retail clients. Too bad.     I use FXi and Autobahn... and I am always looking for new and better.
