                       Well, maybe that&amp;#039;s why Jarrow-Yildirim is not very widely used in practice...    I don&amp;#039;t really know what to say.  I know that some dealers (specifically, Barclays) will quote swaps in conventions other than ZC, but only if you ask them nicely.  I really don&amp;#039;t know of a good live data source, in Bloomberg or otherwise.  Sorry...
