ummm obviously dude... thats why the majority of finance firms, along with freddie mac and fannie mae, are getting raped and pillaged.  aside from firms like barclays and goldman, and smaller pseudo-boutique places like jefferies that dont play in those areas.... they&amp;#039;re all getting beat up -real- bad. just look at major credit companies like citi..  its nuts how over extended they are.  all these write downs by the large brokers?  its nuts.  that kind of fallout just gets soaked up by the economy at large and hurts everyone  everything&amp;#039;s over extended beyond any sane means
