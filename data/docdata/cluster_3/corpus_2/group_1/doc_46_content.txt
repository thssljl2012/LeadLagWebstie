         I don&amp;#039;t think even the best bank bulls on these boards could match this one :^)   http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/    &amp;amp;quot;And there are three very striking features of these figures:  1) impairment charges, ignoring the credit-markets ghastliness, are up only a bit - and charges against loan losses in UK retail banking are only very slightly higher (which will make HBOS feel queasy); 2) it&amp;#039;s been ruthless in cutting costs, to prepare itself for leaner times; 3) and it has captured a staggering 26% of the new mortgage lending market, up from just 6%.  That last statistic tells you quite how hobbled are most of the other British banks. Barclays is capturing huge share of a rapidly shrinking market because it has the wherewithal and confidence to play.  And lest you think it is taking foolish risks with house prices falling,  the average value of these new mortgages is 51% of the value of the respective properties - so it&amp;#039;ll make good money on all scenarios for our economy other than Armageddon .&amp;amp;quot;   ----------  And crikey..!!!! I thought 63% LTV was low risk for new LLOY mortgages.... Average 51% LTV for Barclays... flippin&amp;#039; &amp;#039;eck... and it&amp;#039;s even managed to take 26% of the market at those (average) figures.   Bring on the house price crash!!!   - venice2001  (Disclosure : potential FTBer, and barclays shareholder (as if you couldn&amp;#039;t have guessed))
