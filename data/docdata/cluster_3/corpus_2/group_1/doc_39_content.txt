Just wondering what other people use, is there a better site. I&amp;#039;ve checked a couple of other banks but not been to impressed and a few other sites with prices that didn&amp;#039;t seem great.                      I used to used  Hargeaves Lansdown  for trading, and then  Share Crazy . Might be worth checking them out but I haven&amp;#039;t used either for a while now though so can&amp;#039;t comment on how good they currently are.

Try looking at  Advfn  for this info.  Share crazy  is pretty good too as is  Digital Look .
