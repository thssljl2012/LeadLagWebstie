Actually, looks like most banks have a rate of 7%, but I&amp;#039;m getting 8%+ on promos for shifting new money to the account between a certain date.      Here&amp;#039;s the savings accounts running promos at 8%+:    ING DIRECT Australia - Home loans, high interest savings, term deposits and business banking.     dragondirect -       Here&amp;#039;s some savings accounts with big Aussie banks at 7%:    NAB - NAB iSaver     Commonwealth Bank Group - Personal - Accounts NetBank Saver Summary page     ANZ Progress Saver - Savings Account          Term deposits are running at 8% though, if the promos are too much hassle.
