      TRUE - if the management of LIoyds TSB had any back bone they would have refused the merger and would have probably been the only UK bank not needing government hand outs now LIoyds will be nationalized and will be five to ten years before the bank will be shipshape so the government can refloat the bank and get some or all its money back.  It also goes to show what type of culture existed at Citibank if their former executives are now exporting their stupidity.  London used to be known as the financial capital of the world now it doesnt even exist guessing the new financial capital will Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai or Sydney  WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE GREAT BRITISH EMPIRE RUINED IN ONE GENERATION
