It was v unlikely anything would happen today. Everyone is waiting for an announcement on toxic debt arrangements and v likely ishare sale - the latter I guess is a done deal - why announce it? Worried bout leaks  destabilising share price?! I reckon it's a done deal, the money being used to join gov scheme. Barcs does have the AIG insurance cash too. Could this be used in conjunction with ishare sale potential cash to join the political gov toxic debt scheme? Barc joins it, in a biggish way, helps political aspects of british banking ... varley is made an Earl and we all join in the banquet. Good luck. The idealistic dreamer!
