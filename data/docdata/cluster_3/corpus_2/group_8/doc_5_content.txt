       Well done to Gordon Brown, we should all take our hats off to him. It is now revealed that he put pressure on Lloyds to buy up HBOS, and in turn has broken both banks.  Testament to this fact is that the CEO of Lloyds get to keep his 2.8m Pension Pot which will not be funded by the taxpayer.  It was my understanding that should a company go under, then the pension funds would be lost so why is it that this man gets to keep his whilst millions of British Workers are losing theirs ?   http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/busi...icle5864824.ece   ERIC DANIELS, the American chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group, was last night under pressure to come clean over his personal tax affairs after his company received a 260 billion government bailout.   Daniels, who earns 1m a year, receives a 25,000 allowance for tax planning advice, paid for by the bank. Lloyds, which could now be up to 77% owned by the taxpayer, refused to say whether the chief executive had reduced his tax bill by claiming non-domicile status.   Sources said last night that Daniels, who was previously a high-flyer at Citibank, had legitimately kept his non-dom status when he joined the board of Lloyds TSB in 2001. He had previously worked in Chile, Panama and Argentina. Non-dom status would enable him to avoid paying UK tax on foreign earnings.   Daniels, 57, who lives in Belgravia, central London, with his Panamanian wife and 18- year-old son, is also in line to receive a Lloyds pension pot worth more than 2.8m, the bill for which will now be picked up by the taxpayer. He is believed to have a second home in Panama.
