        QUOTE (tonyblair &#064; Mar 3 2009, 12:26 PM)       you don't think there would have been s catastrophic knock-on effect if the banks that were going down were left to go all the way down?? (and i don't mean just the British ones) I think I'm an optimistic person, but I'm not in your league     Well Lehman Bros was allowed to go under and Im pretty sure we havent had the end of the world, the average US bank is leveraged around 12 to 1, out of around 60 -70 only around 10 are in trouble, in the uk HSBC look like surviving along with Barclays, Lloyds would of probably been ok if the government hadnt forced through the Halifax merger without looking at its liabilities.
