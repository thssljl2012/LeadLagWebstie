Let's hope the shorters lose out this time.Their blatant greed has caused mayhem in the financial sector.Sky mentioned that Poulson made &pound;480m profit shorting Lloyds.Let's hope Barclays will recover to well over &pound;1 where it truly belongs.    Good to see some sense coming back with this analyst who has given a price target of &pound;1.10,still way undervalued.You go into any branch of Barclays and you will see all the staff firing on all cylinders,and they've had a cracking start to 2009.Barclays staff are keen to see the share price back up to realistic levels.    Let's hope some sense is finally coming back to the market,especially in view of Citibank's comments yesterday.
