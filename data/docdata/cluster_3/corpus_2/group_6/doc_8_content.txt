   Loss-making Royal Bank of Scotland pledged to step up lending to big corporates and lend a further 6m to a wide range of customers as part of an agreement with the government to increase its stake in the troubled Edinburgh-based bank to 68%.    As shares in RBS lost two thirds of their value to close at just 11.9p today, the government altered the terms of the October bail out to allow preference shares - which do not carry voting rights - to convert into ordinary shares almost immediately.    The preference shares were originally supposed to be held by the government for three years and carried a 12% rate of interest at a cost to RBS of 600m.    Being released from those interest payments will allow RBS to lend more but also infuriated private shareholders who attacked the "creeping nationalisation of the sector".    The UK Shareholder Association, which represents private investors, was angered by the conversion rate of the preference shares of 31.75p - and blamed this for fuelling the collapse today.    Amid expectations that the government's next move will be to fully nationalised the stricken Edinburgh-based bank, its chief executive Stephen Hester conceded the previous management had made some "misjudgements".    Unions now fear sweeping job cuts at RBS, which lost 66% of its value to close at 11.6p. The taxpayer is sitting on a 12.5bn loss on its 58% stake which is going to rise to 68% following the decision by the government is going to convert 5bn of preference shares - which do not carry voting rights - into ordinary share.    This bolsters its regulatory capital and releases RBS from 600m of interest payments on the preference shares. Analysts at Nomura believe that the government's stake could rise to 100% if today's package of measures designied to stimulate lending fail.    RBS admitted it faced writedowns of up to 20bn from paying too much for previous acquisitions - notably Dutch bank ABN Amor last year and US bank Charter One in 2004 - and up to 8bn of losses from credit crunch writedowns. Those losses will wipe out profits made its retail bank - which includes NatWest - and insurance division, owner of Churchill and Direct Line.    The losses caused Brown to launch a furious attack on the bank, which had embarked upon a rapid expansion plan under the previous management led by chief executive Sir Fred Goodwin.    "Today's write-off by the Royal Bank of Scotland is for irresponsible losses accumulated in American sub-prime markets that partly derive from the acquisition of the Dutch bank ABN Amro."    Saying he was "angry" about RBS, the prime minister also added that "clearly the wrong investments" had been made by the bank.    However, Brown refused to say whether action should be taken against Goodwin or other senior figures over "irresponsible" behaviour.    Hester, brought in two months ago to replace Goodwin who officially leaves at the end of the month, acknowledged the previous management had been overly optimistic about the market environment.    But, he cautioned anyone against trying to demonise bankers. "Let none of us cast stones too readily," Hester said.    He admitted total nationalisation of the bank had been discussed. But Hester insisted that government did not want to take such a drastic measure having had two opportunities to do so - first in October when the government put 20bm into the bank and again this weekend when the second round of measures to prop up banks and kick start lending were negotiated.    "It was discussed as something we all wish to avoid," Hester said.    In return for the preference shares being converted three years earlier than planned, RBS has promised to increase lending by 6bn in the next  12 months. A condition of the previous bail-out to maintain lending to small businesses and households at 2007 levels will also be made for lending to large corporates.    ruce Packard, banks analyst at stockbroker Evolution, said: "These share price movements tell you that the government has gone around and said the bank bail-out in October hasn't worked and if they hadn't done that I don't think we'd be in this position.    "I'm a banks analyst and I don't want to criticise the government. They did the right thing in the second half of October but I'm not sure they're doing the right thing now."    He has price target for RBS shares of 18p."Full-scale nationalisation" is the most likely step for RBS if the second banking bail-out fails to work, analysts at Nomura said today.    RBS Group chief executive, Stephen Hester, said: "I do feel sorry for shareholders - I'm one of them. This is not the sort of record any enterprise would be proud of, it's our job to fix things now."    Unite's joint general secretary, Derek Simpson said, "This new rescue package appears to be only one step removed from full-blown nationalisation. There are hundreds of thousands of people employed in the British retail banks -  these jobs support jobs on the high street -  they are crucial to the wider economy,  they must be protected. RBS employs 100 000 staff alone,  it 's preparing  to post the biggest loss in corporate history. The Government  must make job protection one of the conditions for increasing its stake in the banks.
