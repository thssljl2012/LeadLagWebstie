Times Online:     British banks are still expected to make billions from their UK customers this year despite unveiling giant losses from their global businesses last week.     Royal Bank of Scotland kicked off a torrid week for millions of bank shareholders when it announced it would make a record loss of 7 billion to 8 billion in 2008 &#8212; or 28 billion after writing down toxic assets.     Its shares plunged 65% over the week, closely followed by Barclays, down 48%, as investors bet it would be the next bank to ask the government for cash.     However, analysts still expect banks to make as much as 4 billion from their core UK businesses when they report profits next month. They even recommend buying the shares on the basis that the banks will ultimately avoid nationalisation.

The forecasts are not such good news for bank customers, who are likely to be squeezed to offset big international losses.     RBS is forecast to make 3.9 billion from UK retail banking by Citigroup, the US bank, which has a buy recommendation on it &#8212; albeit a highly speculative one.     &#8220;The UK government has clearly stated nationalisation is not its objective, but while this even remains a possibility we expect RBS to prove a volatile investment,&#8221; said analyst Tom Raynor.     He expects Barclays to make 1.09 billion from UK banking, although profits are likely to fall below the 1 billion mark in subsequent years.     The forecasts appear to be a vindication for investors who piled into financials last week: RBS, Lloyds and Barclays accounted for 70% of all &#8220;buys&#8221; at broker TD Waterhouse on Monday, with a buy to sell ratio between the three shares of 5:1 last week.     We look at the prospects for shareholders and customers.      SHAREHOLDERS       What happened last week?       The government announced its second billion-pound rescue plan for the banks in a bid to thaw the frozen credit markets, as it emerged that global losses at RBS would be worse than feared.     Alistair Darling&#8217;s proposals included a scheme to let banks insure their riskiest assets against default with the government for a fee. With this in place, banks may be more willing to lend to each other.      Will the banks have to be nationalised?      The government already owns 43% of Lloyds and raised its stake in RBS last week to 70%. John McFall, Commons Treasury committee chairman, urged the full nationalisation of RBS and Lloyds, which would put them on the same footing as Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, whose shareholders are likely to get little &#8212; if anything &#8212; back. However, Treasury minister Lord Myners spoke out against nationalisation.

Many commentators think nationalisation remains an option, despite government protestations.     John Greenwood at fund manager Invesco said: &#8220;With the economy contracting as fast as it is, further erosion of bank capital cannot be ruled out. This means the government could end up owning the majority of the domestic banking sector.&#8221;     And stockbrokers advised their clients to sell now to recoup some of their losses.     Graham Spooner, investment adviser at The Share Centre, said: &#8220;No doubt some shareholders will be tempted to hang on to their shares in the hope that things will pick up. However, RBS could be just one step away from nationalisation.&#8221;      CUSTOMERS       What does it mean for my mortgage?      There were tentative signs last week that the package might be having an impact, after government-owned NatWest and RBS announced cuts to mortgage rates on Friday.      Will I be squeezed in favour of investors?      Probably. John-Paul Crutchley at investment bank UBS has a buy recommendation on Lloyds.     He said: &#8220;We think there is considerable scope to effect a general repricing of products across the UK market.&#8221;                Page 2 of 2                    thread start
