        QUOTE    Home &gt; Breaking News &gt; Money &gt; Story April 26, 2009  Northern Rock bank to be sold LONDON - STATE-OWNED British bank Northern Rock will be sold before the end of the year, the Sunday Times newspaper reported, without citing its source.  The British government, which has pumped billions of pounds into troubled banks since the credit crunch erupted in late 2007, wants to retrieve some of its money, according to the weekly newspaper.  Northern Rock, based in the northeastern English city of Newcastle, was taken into public ownership last year after it ran into severe funding problems because of the global squeeze on credit.  Advisers at Swiss bank Credit Suisse have begun drawing up a Northern Rock sale plan, the Sunday Times said.  The paper added that Northern Rock's most toxic or high-risk loans would be hived off into a so-called 'bad bank' that the government would keep.  However, the remaining 'good bank' assets could be worth about 2 billion pounds (S&#036;2.8 billion), according to analysts' estimates cited by the newspaper.  The Treasury has already sounded out possible buyers including Virgin Money, National Australia Bank and Spanish group Santander, while private equity groups Blackstone and Towerbrook were also interested, the paper added.  However, a Northern Rock spokesman said that no timetable had been set for any sale of the bank.  Northern Rock, once Britain's fifth-biggest home loan provider, faced potential collapse in September 2007 as banks tightened lending criteria amid uncertainty over exposure to the collapsed US subprime home loan sector.  The troubled group was forced to request emergency funding from the Bank of England - which sparked the first run on a British bank for more than a century. -- AFP      http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNew...ory_368882.html
