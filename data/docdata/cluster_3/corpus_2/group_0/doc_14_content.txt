Wait. Do not sell for a day or two. NO institution is  going to sell it tomorrow for shorts to cover. Infact  institution will start to buy tomorrow. It is the  nervous retailers who will fall pray to shorts in  their eager to cover.          If Morgan Stanleys upgrade has any real meat in it,  this stock will be trading at or above 30 tomorrow  morning.   Because it way oversold and overshorted.          Barclays story is a bluff in asking LEH for a  discount.   Barclays if they ever talk like that,  they wont have the opportunity of getting LEH at all  if there is a bidding  war.
