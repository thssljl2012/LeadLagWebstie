 Edited on Tue Jul-08-08 08:24 AM by Finnfan         I will hurt the shorts, and that is my goal, Richard S. Fuld Jr. fumed.  Richard S. Fuld Jr., the chairman of Lehman Brothers, has vented about short sellers.  It was April, and Mr. Fuld was blaming short sellers, one of the most maligned tribes on Wall Street, for spreading rumors about Lehman Brothers, the troubled investment bank he runs. Shorts bet against stocks, and Lehman, they were whispering, looked like the next Bear Stearns.  Mr. Fuld must have been irate again last week, when Lehmans stock price plunged 11 percent in the space of three hours for no apparent reason. The shares opened that June 30 morning at $22.25, drifted higher  and then took an abrupt turn around 1:30 p.m. Lehman closed that day at $19.81, its lowest level since 2000.  This time, the rumor du jour wasnt that Lehman was going to be forced into bankruptcy. No, this time the talk was that Lehman was about to be sold to Barclays, the big British bank. It was eerily reminiscent of Bear Stearnss fire sale to JPMorgan Chase in March. And when it comes to Lehman, the shorts have bet right lately: the stock has lost almost 70 percent of its value this year.  The rumor turned out to be wrong, as rumors often do. But this one even had an exact price: Lehman would be sold for $15 a share, traders buzzed all afternoon, in what would amount to a take under  Wall Street parlance for when a company sells itself for less than its market value.  Maybe a few people were whispering, but many more seemed to be listening. Talk that Barclays was buying even reached Lehmans trading desks, where the rumor whipped around the office and then reverberated across Wall Street again. Panicky Lehman employees started calling friends outside the firm to find out what was going on inside the firm. One Lehman executive said, Even my mother-in-law called me.   http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/08/business/08sorkin.htm...
