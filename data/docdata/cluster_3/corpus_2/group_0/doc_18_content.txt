I took it upon myself to actually call someone at  Barclays N. American headquarters in N.Y.   I was  transferred to someone who works the investment  banking arm of the bank.   When I asked if they were  holding or going to be purchasing shares in XsunX  they responded by saying, &amp;amp;quot;We often purchase  positions in young start up companies as a way to  broaden our overall investment portfolio.   However,  Barclays does not reveal any of its future investment  plans until those plans are fully carried  out.&amp;amp;quot;        Hmmm!   I guess that means  maybe?????
