I was all prepared to run to the hills with 400 tins of beans...      Oh well, at least we can thank the chairman of Citigroup who kindly tells us that house prices will continue to fall for two more years.  Yep, this is from the guy that, it could be argued, caused the drop in house prices in the first place, making things better by spreading a little consumer confidence                            Citigroup  in November 2006,  had just ended its third quarter with net income of $5.3 billion. But a year later, as the subprime mortgage meltdown began to roil the economy, Citigroups finances began to suffer.    In the past three quarters, it has lost $17 billion  including a $2.5 billion loss reported on Friday  caused by $38 billion in credit losses and write-downs for bad mortgage investments. Since early 2007, the company has cut about 28,000 jobs.    Maybe as a thick fat american Citigroup Chairman would spread a little bad tidings into the City after a heavy lunch...... It doesnt take a smug rich city type more than a nono second to spread doom and gloom....... Just look at this forum, Anyway Citigroup are on the up......Barclays outside of the UK as almost mirrored everything citigroup has done which includes propping  up its capital position, Barclays recently sold $8.9 billion in new stock.
