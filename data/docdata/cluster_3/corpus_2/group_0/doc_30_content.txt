Sometimes &amp;amp;quot;good companies&amp;amp;quot; have &amp;amp;quot;bad stocks&amp;amp;quot;. Usually  when this happens, it&amp;#039;s time to  buy.        Like when I bought Philip Morris at $22 way back  when everybody thought they were going bankrupt from  all of the tobacco lawsuits. They  didn&amp;#039;t..LMAO.
