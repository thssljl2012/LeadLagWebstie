       &amp;amp;quot;I am also thinking for my aunt. Would it be possible to get REITs yielding 15% at the bottom??? &amp;amp;quot;   Why not get some stronger bank/insurance company trups or preferred (e.g. JPM, WFC, AIG), they yield anywhere 7-8% now and in the panic a couple weeks ago, they yield about 13-14%.. (check the pricing of JPM/PW, ONE/PW, JPM/PP, BWF, FWF, JWF, AVF, and AFF during the panic a couple weeks ago).
