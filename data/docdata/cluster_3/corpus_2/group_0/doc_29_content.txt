 From today&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Rail Management&amp;#039;       http://91.186.0.3/~keepingt/rm/index.htm        DfT starts work on IEP document mountain        Process of evaluation will take until next year.      Assessment more complex than a franchise bid.       The Department for Transport said both the surviving bidders for the InterCity   Express Programme contract met the noon deadline for submitting their documents on Monday, and warned that evaluation of the mountain of data requested will probably take until 2009.      Hitachi Europe had caused a stir at the last moment by announcing that it   was being replaced by a new bidder, Agility Trains, consisting of Hitachi Japan, Barclays Private Equity and John Laing Projects and Developments.   Barclays had previously been involved in the third bid, a consortium   led by Alstom, which withdrew from the contest in February.      The permission of the Department for Transport was needed for the change   of bidder, but in the circumstances the DfT was unlikely to refuse, because to   so would have left just one contender  Express Rail Alliance  which is led by   Bombardier and Siemens and also includes Angel Trains and investment   house Babcock &amp;amp;amp; Brown.      The DfT said the bidders had delivered many boxes of documents, and   that work had now started on wading through the contents. The process will   be much more complex than dealing with a new franchise, and the Department   does not expect to complete its evaluation before the New Year.      The essential specifications have not changed, with the size of the proposed   fleet ranging between 500 and 1500 vehicles of three types  electric, self   powered (diesel) and hybrid.      The bidders will have been required to deal with a multiplicity of options,   based on these core requirements.
