       &amp;amp;lt;&amp;amp;lt;Exit stage right?&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;  If that&amp;#039;s where the trapdoor is, possibly.   It must be unprecedented for 3 major European banks (Barclays, RBS, Fortis) to have made such specific and dire predictions about the US financial market direction in the next few months. Makes me wonder if they&amp;#039;re just saying what everybody inside the financial industry knows, but nobody in the US dare say.
