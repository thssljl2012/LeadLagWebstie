      It&amp;#039;s flamin&amp;#039; hard to keep up at the moment&amp;amp;#33;  &amp;amp;quot;St George Bank has lifted its standard variable home loan rate by 0.20% to 9.67%.  Australia&amp;#039;s fifth largest bank attributed the rise to the continuing high cost of funds it sources itself.  The 0.20 per cent rate rise equates to an increase in a home loan payment of about &amp;amp;#036;10 per week on an average sized loan of &amp;amp;#036;250,000 over 30 years.&amp;amp;quot;
