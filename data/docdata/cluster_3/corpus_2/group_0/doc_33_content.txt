         Strike Oil (STX:AU) released their quarterly report a few days back...   http://strikeoil.com.au/media/2008_07_25_Fourth_Quarter_Acti...   A few key points...   &amp;amp;quot;...&amp;amp;#8226; Oil and gas revenue for the quarter was $9.22 million, up 165% on the previous quarter; &amp;amp;#8226; Gas production was up 88% for the quarter and oil condensate production increased by 129%; &amp;amp;#8226; Four Rayburn wells successfully tested and brought onto production (one subsequent to end of quarter); &amp;amp;#8226; Rocky Mountains assets sold for US$2.5 million - proceeds redirected to focus on highly successful Gulf Coast programme; &amp;amp;#8226; US$11.7 million debt facility secured with Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd; &amp;amp;#8226; Further development drilling planned for Gulf Coast - fully funded from operating cash flows and bank facility; &amp;amp;#8226; 2008/09 revenues now targeting between $50-55 million - up from previously reported range of $35-40 million. Managing...&amp;amp;quot;   As you can see for yourself, they are sitting on a nice little earner at Rayburn.  In fact, since the end of quarter, they have recently brought another producer online at Duncan-3, which is currently flowing at 10mmCFpd with 234bcpd.  Just a note though, that their forecast of 55-60mn annual revenue is based on gas price of US10/mCF and US120/bc...   &amp;amp;quot;...The 2007/08 oil and gas revenues for the year totalled $15.7 million (up 82% on $8.7 million for 2006/07). The Company&amp;amp;#8217;s revenues have now reached record levels of $4 million per month (on track to exceed recent forecasts of $35-40 million for the 2008/09 financial year) and enabling the Company to revise its 2008/09 forecast to $50-55 million based only on estimated production from wells already drilled assuming gas prices of US$10 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) and oil prices of US$120 per barrel. Additional success from new wells could see the production increase above these estimates...&amp;amp;quot;   So depending on your own long term price assumption, this may vary slightly.  Of course, they have two additional wells to be brought into production, with two further appraisal wells to be drilled.  One of which is currently being drilled at HDGU-1.  This well is a huge stepout well given it&amp;#039;s about 2.8km from the original D1 discovery well.  As Simon Ashton had already previously stated, there are &amp;amp;quot;multiple of 100s of BCF&amp;amp;quot; of recoverable reserves at Rayburn.  The big question remaining to be answered is just how much gas they have discovered there at Rayburn.  If this stepout at HDGU1 is successful, we could be talking north of 300-400BCF.  Based on my discussion with SA, an independent reserve certification is currently underway and the results from the next two wells, together with all the production data to date, will be incorporated into the reserve certification.  This is expected to be ready around end of Sept when they release their final year report.  There are 300mn shares/options on issue (fully diluted), so based on today&amp;#039;s closing price of 29.5, its market cap is a ridiculous 97.37mn.  They have 8.4mn cash, but they have used 7.5mn of their 12mn loan facilities.  But I expect this to be paid off by end of the current fiscal year.  As one would expect with any company embarking at the start of a field development programme, it is capital intensive upfront with income ramping up - especially as they are drilling wells faster than they can bring the wells into production (due to constraints of a single rig, pipe and completion equipments, etc).  However, it will reach a point where production will ramp up to the point where they will become fully self-funding.  I don&amp;#039;t expect this to be far away.  Beyond that, they will become extremely profitable.  SA had stated that the cost of each well is about 1BCF, with recoverables in the order of 5 to 10BCF, 70-80% of which is expected to be produced within the first 2-3 years.  So payback is very quick and margin very high.  Based on my discussion with SA, I also believe that they are actively looking for a second rig to clear some of the expected backlogs of wells to be drilled (exploration and appraisals).  In summary, I believe there are sufficient evidence of a substantial discovery and a prolific producing reservoir at Rayburn - one that will transform Strike Oil into a mid-tier E&amp;amp;P company.  As always, do your own research.  Note that this is all IMHO, and I do have a stake in the company.  Cheers, 618  PS. Just as a side note, 618.5 is now holding 618.51 :o)))
