That&amp;#039;s an interesting way of dodging the fact that deficit spending, and the continuous production of government securities supercharges the money creation process when it is put through FRB.      No.  I don&amp;#039;t always argue that.    The reality is, yes the FED can create money without government debt, however government debt can not continue unchecked without a FED, and a constant demand for securities.  It is a symbiotic relationship, as both are parasitic to true wealth and the citizenry.    I think most people on this forum are aware that the FED is a private organization, it manipulates the money supply and cartelizes the banking industry.  It enables government deficit spending, and it debases our currency as it transfers wealth away from the people and to the banks.  The genii is out of the bottle.                      The government  has  to fund itself without the Fed. Unfortunately for you, that&amp;#039;s what the law says. Do you know who funds the government (i.e. buy the Treasury Securities in the primary market)? Banks do. In fact, I&amp;#039;m feeling generous today, so I&amp;#039;ll give you a list of the major buyers:    BNP Paribas Securities   Banc of America Securities   Barclays Capital  Bear, Stearns &amp;amp;amp; Co.
