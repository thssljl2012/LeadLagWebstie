           According to this US commentator the US banks are pretty much all toast:   http://www.financialsense.com/Market/barbera/2008/0701.html   Interesting to note Deutsche Bank and Barclays also on the verge of major falls, according to their charts. What does that mean for the other UK banks (international or domestic) ?
