 GTE Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              Barclays Jumps on board for 2.5mil sh      http://www.mffais.com/gte.html    Expansion of acceptance in the global investment community..............is a good thing. Unless they take the stock down to do it. Be curious to see what their buys were - I&amp;#039;m guessing a sliding SP from mid - upper $6&amp;#039;s down to upper $5&amp;#039;s. I hope the MM is done making deals for a while. I have been quite comfortable adding over the last week. Perhaps, I should thank them.   Would imagine, by the vacuum principle, this would be beneficial to Solana as well.  Regards,   bh
