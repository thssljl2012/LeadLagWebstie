Even places like Sudbury, where housing values could move with the ebbs and flows of the mining industry.      Genworth and AIG however can cherrypick: they participate mostly in lucrative urban centres only.  The real story is what Genworth and AIG will do now that CMHC exited the 0% downpayment and 40-year amortization market.  As of now they are still offering the product.  If Pitz is right then they will keep offering these products and possibly increase their prices due to lesser competition.  We shall see.      Hey Pitz, do you like Ayn Rand?                      There is no way Genworth and AIG would continue offering these products when the lenders can&amp;#039;t securitize these loans under CMHC.  It would be completely pointless to push these products on clients when the company can&amp;#039;t re-sell them on the secondary market.
