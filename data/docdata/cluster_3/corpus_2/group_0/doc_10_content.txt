 My understanding is that the decision was made as a result of difficulty in obtaining funding through the markets, but that this was not seen as good  PR  for Barclays, so they claimed a lack of demand.      We are not seeing a lack of demand in the secured market, but what we are seeing is a genuine lack of ability to actually get deals done as lenders become more and more cautous. Reduced conversions lead to reduced CPA&amp;#039;s.      The withdrawal of First Plus from the market will only make things worse, IMO.      Interestingly, the unsecured market is booming - maybe because consumers no longer have confidence in their home&amp;#039;s equity being adequate to finance further borrowing.
