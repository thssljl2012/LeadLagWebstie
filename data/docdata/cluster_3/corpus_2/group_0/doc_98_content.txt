    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 2              Good news for MIRABELA NICKEL    &amp;amp;nbsp;         MIRABELA SECURES DEBT FINANCING PACKAGE             PERTH, AUSTRALIA    Mirabela Nickel Limited (TSX: MNB, ASX: MBN) is pleased to announce it has entered into a US$80m bridge financing facility with Barclays and Credit Suisse to fund ongoing construction at Santa Rita.    Furthermore, Barclays and Credit Suisse have agreed to underwrite a US$280m term loan facility, subject to standard conditions including syndication. Drawdown under the US$280m facility is expected to take place before year end whereupon the US$80m bridge facility will be repaid. The bridging loan and the US$280m underwriting are credit approved by both Banks. 1,500,000 options will be issued to the Banks (half each) priced at A$7.22. The options will vest subject to certain milestones and are exercisable for the period three years after the date the options vest.    We are delighted to obtain credit approval for bank financing and secure financing for ongoing construction of the Santa Rita project, said Managing Director, Nick Poll. Whilst general credit market conditions have weakened over the last year, interest in financing the Santa Rita project has remained strong. This reflects the low capital and operating cost structure of the Santa Rita project compared with other new nickel projects, he said.    Under an offtake agreement announced today, Votorantim will provide Mirabela with an additional US$50M in prepayment financing, which will be subordinated to the Bank facilities.    This total debt package is expected to finance the remaining construction costs and working capital requirements for development of the Santa Rita Project at a throughput rate of 4.6 million tonnes a year. Construction is now about 30% complete and the project remains on track to commence production mid 2009.    Barclays and Credit Suisse are leaders in emerging market financing and their teams respectively bring a wealth of experience in mining &amp;amp;amp; metals, financing projects and Brazil specifically. They are complemented by two of the strongest commodity derivative groups in the investment banking sector.        MIRABELA S IGNS 5 YEAR OFFTAKE AGREEMENT WITH VOTORANTIM        Mirabela Nickel Limited (TSX: MNB, ASX: MBN) is pleased to announce it has entered into a 5 year offtake agreement with Votorantim Metais Nquel S.A., a subsidiary of the Votorantim group. Votorantim Metais will purchase 50% of the nickel concentrate produced at Santa Rita until the end of 2014. The concentrate will be purchased at the mine gate.    Production from Santa Rita is expected to start mid 2009 at a capacity of 18,500tpy of nickel in concentrate, increasing to 25,000tpy within the first year of production. Construction is about 30% complete and the project is on schedule.    As part of the offtake arrangements, Votorantim has agreed to provide Mirabela with a prepayment facility of US$50m, which will be subordinated to the US$280m bank debt facility, announced separately today.    We are delighted to have secured a Brazilian offtake partner for 50% of our nickel sulphide concentrates, said Managing Director, Nick Poll. The agreement with Votorantim meets our expectations on net payments for nickel and various credits, whilst delivery at the mine gate is convenient for Mirabela and reduces our working capital requirements. We believe Votorantim will be excellent offtake partners and we welcome their participation in the Santa Rita project. The market for nickel sulphide concentrate remains strong and we are in advanced negotiations in respect of the remaining 50%, he said.    Votorantim is one of the largest private industrial conglomerates in Latin America and produces about 25,000tpy of nickel from laterite and sulphide sources within Brazil. The concentrates will be smelted at Votorantims Fortaleza de Minas plant in Minas Gerais.
