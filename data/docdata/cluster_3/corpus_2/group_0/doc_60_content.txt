 The Fund invests in U.S. dollar-denominated, high quality, short-term money market instruments issued by U.S. and foreign issuers. The Fund may invest in certificates of deposit, high quality debt obligations, certain obligations of U.S. and foreign banks, certain repurchase agreements and obligations of the U.S. government, its agencies and instrumentalities (including government-sponsored enterprises). The Fund is a feeder fund. A feeder fund does not invest directly in a portfolio of securities. Instead, to pursue its investment objective, it invests all of its assets in another investment company called the Money Market Master Portfolio (the Master Portfolio), a series of Master Investment Portfolio (MIP), a registered open-end management investment company issuing individual interests in multiple series. Barclays Global Fund Advisors (BGFA) serves as the investment adviser to the Master Portfolio.  --------  Default Risk. Although the risk of default is generally considered unlikely, any default on an investment made by the Master Portfolio could cause the Funds share price or yield to fall. Foreign Securities Risks. The Master Portfolio may invest in the securities of foreign issuers, so long as they are denominated in U.S. dollars. Securities of foreign issuers carry additional risks due to reasons ranging from a lack of information about the issuer to the risk of political uncertainties. Concentration Risk. The risks associated with concentrating investments in the banking industry include interest rate risk, credit risk, and the risk of negative regulatory or market developments affecting the banking and financial services industries.    https://www.paypal.com/en_US/pdf/PayPal_Prospectus.pdf
