    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 6              Re: OT?: Fortis, RBS, Barclays, Fleckenstein predict imminent US financial meltdown    &amp;quot;Are hinting at the financials are where we should be?&amp;quot;    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Oh gawd no!&amp;amp;nbsp;     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Financials?    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Are you kidding me?    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Nope, real companies, that produce real stuff of value, with low valuations.&amp;amp;nbsp; Unless you want to gamble on some short term GS call options.&amp;amp;nbsp; That might be worth a bet.&amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;    I&amp;#039;m just saying, if you&amp;#039;ve spent most of the year switching between buying real commod companies and shorting financials...now is the time to back off shorting the financials, and lean more into the long side.&amp;amp;nbsp; I do think oil will have a pullback, and oil co&amp;#039;s will get hit (absurdly, but predictably)...so keep some cash to lean hard into them too.&amp;amp;nbsp;          thread start
