Kelli Kuehne    73            1033                      That&amp;#039;s correct.    Two scores were calculated incorrectly by the spreadsheet for MPfan. Sherri Turner&amp;#039;s 66 was recorded as a 70 and Hee-Won Han&amp;#039;s 71 was recorded as a 68.    You can see the error here:   http://bp2.blogger.com/_VEe3iEbncUE/...orecard_r2.png     This was not an error in the spreadsheet formula. It was an error in the data entry person&amp;#039;s fingers, that would be me.    MPfan told me about the Sherri Turner problem but not the Hee-Won Han problem.      The result is a net gain of one point. it did not change the overall placement for her or anyone else in the contest.    Sorry about that.
