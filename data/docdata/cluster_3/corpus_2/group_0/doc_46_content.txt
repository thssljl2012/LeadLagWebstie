Listen I m just a public information service.  I m just saying what the top people in the banking industry are saying.  Do you think somehow you know something they don t ?  i don t think so somehow..  By the way you don t want to hear what Barclays bank  the 2nd largest in the UK with huge worldwide assets are saying about the future of the u s economy in their latest financial reports to investors...   maybe  their a bunch of morons also and they don t know what they re talking about?
