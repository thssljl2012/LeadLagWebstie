Lehman, Barclays Say Sell Investment-Grade Bonds  (Update1)          By Bryan Keogh and Gabrielle  Coppola         June 30 (Bloomberg) -- Lehman Brothers Holdings  Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Barclays Capital are  telling investors to sell some of their holdings of  investment-grade corporate bonds in anticipation the  debt will slump for a second straight year as the  economy slows.          Lehman, whose fixed-income research group ranked  first for eight straight years by Institutional  Investor magazine, advised clients to cut holdings on  concern companies will report ``softer&amp;#039;&amp;#039; earnings.  Bank of America says yields may rise as financial  institutions flood the market with debt. Barclays  analysts said they ``remain cautious&amp;#039;&amp;#039; because  consumer spending is likely to slow.          Company bonds lost 0.7 percent this year and are  underperforming Treasuries for the second straight  year, the longest losing streak since 1998, according  to Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. index data. While corporate  bonds rose in April after the Federal Reserve  brokered the bailout of Bear Stearns Cos., investors  are focusing on slowing economic growth and rising  defaults.          ``The U.S. economy is in the midst of a significant  credit recession,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Jack Malvey, Lehman&amp;#039;s chief  global fixed-income strategist. ``We&amp;#039;re not done  readjusting the price of credit risk.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;          Defaults rose to the highest in 31 months last  quarter, Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s said. The number of U.S.  companies facing credit-rating downgrades is rising  at a faster pace than before the recession in 2001,  according to S&amp;amp;P. The tally rose 24 percent since  last June, compared with a 10 percent increase  between June 2000 and June 2001.          Spreads Widen          The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to own  investment-grade debt instead of government bonds  jumped 20 basis points this month to 268 basis  points, the most since April, according to Merrill&amp;#039;s  U.S. Corporate Master index. Spreads on  investment-grade bonds, those rated at least Baa3 by  Moody&amp;#039;s Investors Service and BBB- or higher by S&amp;amp;P,  began the year at 203 basis points, 2.03 percentage  points.          Corporate bonds returned 4.6 percent in 2007, while  Treasuries benefited from demand for the safety of  government debt as credit market losses spread.  Returns totaled 2.1 percent this year and 9.1 percent  in 2007, according to Merrill&amp;#039;s U.S. Treasury Master  index.
