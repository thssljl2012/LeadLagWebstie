       Lehman can no longer hide its failures    Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. plunged as traders speculated the fourth- largest U.S. securities firm may be sold for less than its market value.    Lehman dipped as low as &amp;amp;#036;19.61 before closing at &amp;amp;#036;19.81, down &amp;amp;#036;2.44, or 10.6%, on the day.  Barclays&amp;#039; would purportedly pick up Lehman at a steep discount, which explains the tumble once the story broke.  Lehman, which recouped some of its loss in after-hours trading, will be a focus Tuesday morning, as investors turn the page on a brutal month.     If you were paying attention you dumped this stock back in March when I told you this company was going to fail, if you are strike then you ignored it, solidifying your position as a complete moron.  Tuesday should be an interestingday for the Lehman company....
