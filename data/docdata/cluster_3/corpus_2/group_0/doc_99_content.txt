          Hi - a week ago, we notified our mortgage provider, Barclays/Woolwich that we&amp;#039;d concluded a new revised price for the house we&amp;#039;re buying. 7 months ago we&amp;#039;d agreed to buy for 267,500. last week we finally settled on 245k. However the amount we want to borrow from Barclays remains the same ie 127,550.     I was told by the mortgage centre there should be no problem with having a new Mortgage offer sent out, showing all the same details as before, but at the newly agreed (lower) purchase price. As our deposit was still very substantial compared to what we were asking to borrow, I was reassured to hear that we would have a new offer back within 5 days.    Well, today, we heard back from Barclays to say that they were about to send out the revised mortgage offer, but had noticed that the property valuation they&amp;#039;d undertaken originally &amp;amp;quot;is now out of date&amp;amp;quot; - and that they would now require a new valuation survey (admittedly, at no extra cost to us), causing a delay in us receiving our new mortgage offer - and at a time when we&amp;#039;re close to exchange of contracts.     I queried Barclay&amp;#039;s claim that the property valuation was &amp;amp;quot;out of date&amp;amp;quot;. How could it be, I asked, given that our original mortgage offer was still valid - through till 11 August?? How was is possible that the property valuation and the mortgage offer on the SAME property were not linked to the SAME date???     And what&amp;#039;s most frustrating is that I had taken the trouble of forewarning Barclays nearly a month ago that we would be likely to be going ahead with purchasing our new house - using the original Barclays mortgage offer, as it was still valid. I said as soon as we had agreed a new purchase price (and that we were expecting it to be lower) I would left Barclays know.    At no point, did anyone at Barclays point out that our property valuation was about to &amp;amp;quot;expire&amp;amp;quot; - and that we would need a new one.     There&amp;#039;s nothing in the small print of the original mortgage offer about the dangers of allowing your mortgage offer to be rendered out of date  - if your new home&amp;#039;s property valuation has already expired without you realising.    Have others experienced this?     cheers    applesareh
