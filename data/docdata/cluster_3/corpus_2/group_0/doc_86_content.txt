    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Re: FINANCIAL TIMES -- BARCLAYS: WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL STORM!    Inflation is a monetary phenomenon:     You can have a Hoover-ville style depression with 25% unemployment and a 90% decline in the stock market&amp;amp;nbsp;and the price of basic necessities can continue to rise, i.e., demand can disappear and essential goods will still be dear. This is not the &amp;#039;30&amp;#039;s...money is no longer&amp;amp;nbsp;coined from gold and silver.    The average person&amp;#039;s idea of money is so anchored by past experience, it is impossible for them to comprehend that the dollar bills in their wallets could lose most or all of their purchasing power in a short period of time.    History makes it very clear, though,&amp;amp;nbsp;that not only can this happen, but is *likely* to happen in circumstances such as the ones that now prevail. By holding the cost of money so far below the level of inflation, the Fed is turning business models upside down throughout the economy.     Crushing the economy will crush the dollar, slash government revenue, and drive up government costs.&amp;amp;nbsp;To monetize the trade and budget deficits, government prints more money...it is a vicious circle, already far advanced,&amp;amp;nbsp;leading toward the&amp;amp;nbsp;final catastrophe of a hyperinflationary depression.     The day of reckoning is fast approaching.    &amp;amp;nbsp;         thread start
