         Mayn -  The credit squeeze is having a funny effect on cash rates, gilt incomes etc and perhaps a proper alignment now would be the market and gilts offering a 6% yield in line with cash in the bank.   People were looking for similar excuses in 2003 to explain away the narrow spread -   Financial Times  Doubts raised over UK equity yield buy signal  Published:  Jan 23, 2003   UK equities are at their cheapest level relative to government bonds since 1967, it emerged this week, yet the London stock market has continued to slide.  So just why are the markets ignoring this seemingly clear-cut fundamental buy signal? Unfortunately, the answer is less clear-cut, with factors such as the perceived unsustainability of dividend yields, the prospect of higher gilt yields and a feared return to the moribund growth environment of the 1950s all playing their part.  First the facts. Falling equity values have increased the yield on the FTSE All Share index to 3.77 per cent, while a simultaneous hunt for safety has pushed up government bond prices worldwide, thereby lowering yields. . . Firstly, does the market place believe that current dividend yields can be sustained? Given the current struggles of many companies, there must be element of doubt. . . Support services stocks WS Atkins and Amey were recently forced to scrap their interim payments, and Royal &amp;amp; Sun Alliance is tipped to follow suit, but much attention is now being focused on the banking sector, which pays out a quarter of the UK&amp;#039;s dividend income. . . However, Stuart Fowler, head of UK equities at Axa, adds a note of caution. He points out that a significant number of UK companies, such as BP, HSBC, Rio Tinto and AstraZeneca, now set their dividends in dollars, then convert them into sterling for UK investors. With the recent weakness in the dollar, this will depress yields in the UK. . . Another potential fly in the ointment is the view that gilt yields may be set to rise, thereby nudging the gilt/equity yield ratio back towards its long-term average. This is based on the premise that the Treasury is set to dramatically increase its issuance of 20-year bonds to pay for Chancellor Gordon Brown&amp;#039;s spending plans and cover a shortfall in tax revenues.     http://www.ft.com/cms/s/92d94ba6-24e4-11d8-81c6-08209b00dd01...   Groundhog day or what &amp;amp;lt;g&amp;amp;gt; !?  It seems to me that you have to go mechanical on this and just believe in it.  Here&amp;#039;s the FTSE All Share performance around the time of the 1967 signal from the Barclays Capital Equity Gilt Study -        Index   Change     1899=100 1966   81   -12.5% 1967  101    25.6% 1968  137    35.4% 1969  111   -19.0% 1970   95   -14.3% 1971  124    30.2% 1972  130     4.8% 1973   81   -37.9% 1974   30   -62.5% 1975   57    89.2% 1976   48   -16.5% 1977   60    25.9% 1978   57    -5.3% 1979   51   -11.0% 1980   56    10.4% 1981   54    -4.3% 1982   62    15.8% 1983   73    16.9% 1984   88    20.5% 1985   95     9.0% 1986  112    17.9%   One aspect of this which I find fascinating is the magnitude of the dividend growth last year at 23.3%. I noticed this when I updated and played around with your analysis, indexing the dividend income and adding RPI for comparison -  http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11115967   This rate of growth was the 5th largest since 1900 -   1920  128.9% 1916   88.2% 1909   26.5% 1979   23.8% 2007   23.3% 1960   21.7% 1984   20.6% 1989   17.0% 1977   16.1% 1988   16.1%   Source - Barclays Capital Equity Gilt Study 2006  Personally, I&amp;#039;ve made made the decision to continue to sit this one out in cash, foregoing any recovery bounce so that I can be more confident of investing in a saner environment. Here&amp;#039;s where I think we&amp;#039;re at -   - half way through the revelation of bad loans  - significant reduction in lending and associated cost increase, with no end in sight  - significant effect on consumer psychology of house price declines, particularly in the UK where property prices are highly influential for the economy, with no end in sight  - oil price at levels which will promote global recession  Daytona
