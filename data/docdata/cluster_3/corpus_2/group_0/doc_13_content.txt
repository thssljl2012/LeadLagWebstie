Maybe if I hold on long enough it will but its a maybe.    What you need to do is move fast...its not for everybody. It does seem looking back thou my best trades have been 1 day to 2-3 months holding. Every time I hold on longer I do not as good. What happens is I forget about selling later on.    Ex..I brought 100 shares of AIG- American Insurance Company day before earnings came out at $44.25 a share, earning were bad, really bad and they needed to raise more cash. I sold it the next day 20 mins after the opening for $41.25 losing just over $300..it stink but the stocks been going down and down. Now its around $23 a share..if I didn&amp;#039;t sell, I be out now almost $2,000-on paper yeah but still. I am very happy I didn&amp;#039;t hang on.
