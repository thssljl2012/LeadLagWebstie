      At last some regulatory authorities are starting to take the bull by the horns. No doubt the first of many and about time too.  Interestingly UBS declared its Tier 1 capital ratio at end of Q2 to be 11.5% (&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;). Is it not astonishing that the Swiss regulators consider yet another &amp;amp;#036;39bn (&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;&amp;amp;#33;) is needed to give the bank the minimum capital foundation required to support its loan book???  And what are RBS&amp;#039;, Barclays&amp;#039; etc. Tier 1 capital ratio again :-)
