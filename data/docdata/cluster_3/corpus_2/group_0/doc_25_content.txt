        QUOTE (Red Kharma &amp;amp;#064; Jul 30 2008, 11&amp;amp;#58;04 AM)       If anyone is interested in the Lloyds numbers...........       QUOTE    and Lloyds TSB wrote down 585 million pounds of credit-related assets .. Lloyds TSB wrote down 62 million pounds on collateralized debt obligations, 170 million pounds on bond insurance, 46 million pounds on a structured investment vehicle and 307 million pounds on traded credit investments. The losses counted against first- half profit.     If Lloyds, the conservative bank, are having to write off 0.5bn, how much are the other less conservative banks going to have to write off. This could be carnage again when the other banks report.  I think HBOS reports tomorrow, that should be fun.
