I agree! Take a look at a poster named Paw. He  presented an interesting scenario, about a French  bank BNP/Paribas It is not farfetched!       Why wouldn&amp;#039;t some of the big foreign banks like  HSBC, or Barclays( which already own a piece of us)  not be  interested?     There is talk that the FED and SEC might allow  private equity, and investment banks to become  activist owners of banks. Is it possible that mutual  funds could be more activist? Take a look at Dodge  and Cox might buy even more? The comments of their  CFO, which I posted, went ignored last  week.     There is an increasing possiblility of a mortgage  insurance package from Congress.This was front page  of the WSJ, on Sat 7/05/08. Preston, Bush&amp;#039;s HUD Sec.  has said that a deal could be worked out. I got this  from the WSJ last week, and posted  this!
