        QUOTE (Injin &amp;amp;#064; Jul 15 2008, 12&amp;amp;#58;58 AM)       Yep.   Given what the governments and bankers have done already - do you think they will be allowed to unwind?  Nominal value will get &amp;amp;quot;printed up&amp;amp;quot; and technically accurate but increasingly valueless payments will be made, up until the moment when Joe Public arrives with pitchfork and fire.     p.s. I am reckon that theres a decent chance this programme will cause some panicky behaviour tomorrow. &amp;amp;quot;Barclays are on the hook for 2.5 trillion&amp;amp;quot; is something anyone can (mis?)understand in a panicky way.
