    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 12              Got phone call from iShares (Barclays Global Investors)   Finally someone there actually contacted me about my (consistent) queries about securities lending.  Here&amp;#039;s what they said: when iShares lends out securities from their ETFs to other investment banks (e.g. stocks, bonds) in return for collateral, they do accept Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt as collateral.&amp;amp;nbsp; And this paper has always been used without problem and no they do not think there are any new problems that would make them rethink taking Fannie/Freddie paper as collateral.  YIKES !&amp;amp;nbsp; I don&amp;#039;t know how much of their collateral is t-bills and how much is agency paper, but given the way agency paper is used by investment banks for everything... something tells me a lot of ETFs actually contain large % of GSE debt in place of the assets it should contain.   Think about that carefully, visualize it. You hold an ETF which you * think * contains your quality stocks, or bonds, or commodities. But in reality, a significant percent (I&amp;#039;ve seen 0% to 20%) may be Fannie Mae debt.  And it&amp;#039;s all legal, can you believe it?
