 The whole housing industry is a Joke imo    And is destined for failure    It appears we are on the American tram of more people the better     Thats an unsustianable and a false economy  imo        One only has to try and find a place to rent     Or drive in or around a major city   Melbourne&amp;#039;s traffic chaos is tipped to rise 100 % wtf ?   Becoming no more the land of a fair go    its just how much you can be robbed       Many ppl have no where to go as all cheap rentals have dried up    I even know of some people heading up bush    Yes living in state forrests like ferals but at least they can live        Funny we never hear the real estate agents using the word over capitalised these days    i hope this phrase will be back in vogue soon       Otherwise all our children may end up in the mines ?            Housing crisis will hit elderly the hardest    HOUSING affordability in Australia is becoming a problem, with affordability levels at the lowest they have been in decades and with little hope of relief in sight.      The problem is exacerbated for older Australians, people with a disability, or anyone trying to balance a budget with a pension as their only means of income.   High interest rates tend to slow home purchases, which reduces the pool of affordable housing stock and inflates rents.          http://business.theage.com.au/housin...0630-2zgk.html         A million houses needed to avoid shortfall        A MILLION new homes need to be built over the next five years to cope with Australias booming population, new figures out from the Housing Association show.      The number of houses currently being built falls well short of this, and according to the HIA, there&amp;#039;ll be a shortfall of at least 175,000 houses if current building rates continue.       Record-low affordability      A shortage of housing is one of the key drivers in record-low housing affordability.      The Housing Industry Association (HIA)/Commonwealth Bank First Home Buyer Affordability Index fell 3.5 per cent in the quarter, and was down 10 per cent on the same time last year.       Mortgage repayments now account for 29.1 per cent of an average first home buyers income  the highest percentage on record.        http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599...rom=public_rss
