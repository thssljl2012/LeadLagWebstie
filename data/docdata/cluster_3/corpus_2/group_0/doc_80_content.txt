Another shareholder dumps their shares in HLS as some of the SHAC UK defendants plead guilty.         Some of you may by now have heard that 3 of the defendants in the SHAC UK    conspiracy trial have pleaded guilty today to conspiracy to blackmail at    Winchester Crown Court. Two of the campaigners, Gregg and Natasha Avery were    already in prison awaiting trial, the other, Dan Amos, has now also been    remanded. Please write letters of support to Dan and all the prisoners. As soon    as Dan&amp;#039;s number and address is confirmed it will be posted on the VPSG website:     www.vpsg.org  .     Show your solidarity and support at this, one of many injustices we fight to    stop. Get angry, get active.         It is important to remember that this is just three of the thousands of SHAC    activists and anti-vivisectionists in many countries around the world, and the    campaign continues against HLS and against vivisection.         To illustrate the point, today we received cofirming news that yet another    institutional shareholder, Acadian Asset Management (Old Mutual) have sold    their shares. This is the third company to dump HLS shares in less than a    month. This leaves the largest institutional shareholder, Barclays Global    Investors UK Holdings Ltd hold 279,842 shares in HLS (LSR), who are part of    Barclays Bank. Their website is:  http://www.barclaysglobal.com  (There will be    an email alert about them very soon).         To put this in perspective, this means that less than 5% of HLS shares are    currently being traded. Meanwhile HLS are still around $80million in debt, they    don&amp;#039;t own their own buildings or land, and are being propped up by the UK    government who are continuing to provide banking and insurance facilities for a    US registered company. This is an absurd position unprecedented in the history    of commerce or protest groups, hundreds of millions of taxpayers money is being    used to keep HLS afloat, while even more taxpayers money is used by the same    government to persecute those who try to stop the suffering of both human and    non-human animals.          We are all part of SHAC and we will all continue the fight against one of the    most disgusting and exposed companies in the world.         Nobody said it was going to be easy, we must now re-double our anger and    commitment. Don&amp;#039;t forget that HLS have to pay back one of their loans of $50    million in a few years and we must not let HLS out of our grasp. Remember, the    only reason HLS is still here is because of our corrupt government and it can    come as no surprise, as this is the same government that are partners in an    illegal war. They will not let ethical considerations cloud their goal of    making money, at any cost. But their unethical policies will cost them dearly    in the long run, the fight goes on.                Previous news from SHAC:    H Partners dumps all HLS (LSR) shares         After Raymond James decided that 7 million shares in HLS blood money were not    for them, or their subsidary Eagle Assset Management, H Partners also made a    quick escape from the campaign against HLS and sold all 11.2 million LSR    shares in mid July.         The sale was confirmed this week by Win Animal Rights in the USA.         H Partners Management    LSR Shares: 459,539    Value: $12,454,000         H Partners Capital    LSR Shares: 368,933    Value: $9,998,000         Combined asset of $22,452,000 / 11,258,085.54         ALL GONE!         Thanks to all supporters and campaigners, including the campaigners that did    demos in the US and London.         Right now the percentage of their institutional investments is listed at 8.63%.    Once the H Partners shares come off it will reduce to about 4 - 4.5% so not    many shares are being held by institutions and companies.         Barclays is the next big shareholder...         Get angry, keep focused, we will not stop until HLS are gone too! For all the    animals that have been tortured and killed by HLS. SHAC and the global animal    right movement will NEVER let you alone. _________________ 4,11,12, remain - take your pick:         http://www.veganfitness.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=14963
