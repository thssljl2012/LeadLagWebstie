 This looks like the possible outcome to me.         Instead, might European banks step forward? Barclays has been rumored as a potential partner for Lehman. It is easy to see the appeal. Such an acquisition would be easily affordable: Barclays has a market capitalization of more than 20 billion pounds (nearly $40 billion). And Lehman must look like a bargain: Not only has Lehmans stock value fallen, but devalued U.S. dollars are essentially the equivalent of Monopoly Money overseas. Barclays doesnt have much in the way of investment banking in the U.S. It could use a Lehman-size footprint. And while Barclays is looking to raise capital as wellas much as three billion pounds, according to the Sunday Telegraphthe conventional wisdom holds that the United Kingdom bank still is looking for acquisitions.     http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2008/06/0...hman-brothers/
