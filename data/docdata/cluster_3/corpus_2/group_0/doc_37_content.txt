Dreamers, lets use some sense, there is not big bank  that has any cash to buy anything.   So all buyout  rumors are just rumors, no one is buying anything.    If they had cash and a balance sheet, they would not  ALL be raising  capital.        Think a little.   Get Paulson and Ben&amp;#039;s schwanz out  of your face and look at  facts.
