katrina forced the industry to be profitable.   they  ahd to raise prices to keep in the game.   this could  be a similar shakeout for those who still have the  ability to expand.   AIG needs to keep itself in  shape to expand when the writeoffs are coming to a  close (whenever that is).   I hold TRV, and so far  nothing major has gone wrong over there.   there  could be a time bomb on that one too.   but if you  look 5-10 years out, its more important for both  companies to remain strong so they can write those  more profitable policies in the near term.    financing hundreds of aircraft that are collecting  dust in the desert outside phoenix is not a  profitable activity, regardless of what the  accountants say about the life of the  assets.
