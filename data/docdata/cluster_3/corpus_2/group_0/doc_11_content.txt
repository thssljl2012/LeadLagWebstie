    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 3              Re: LEH take under?   Nobody is going to buy this POS until its $2 just like BSC. The last I read 70% of their assets are LEVEL 3. How can a firm that has an open Fed Discount window and a $6 billion secondary at $28 be trading under $20? Why would Barclays buy this toxic piece of crap for anything. At least JPM got a nice building for BSC.          thread start
