    The Violent 2 Stepper:  I love the site your getting your sources from. Did you know that 10 US crop circles have been sited as well according to it! GASP!!!! It must be true!!!   Don&amp;#039;t like that link? How about a couple links from De Telegraaf? That&amp;#039;s the largest Dutch paper.  They took down the  original  article. But there&amp;#039;s a Dutch version available  if you want to translate . The link I provided initially translated the article.  Also,  Barclays  warns of financial storm. That&amp;#039;s  from the Telegraph.   RBS   issues global stock and credit crash alert  Do you really not know what&amp;#039;s going on around you?
