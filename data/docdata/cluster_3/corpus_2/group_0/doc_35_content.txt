For your guess is not credibility at all.                      Essentaillly collecting $50B from resturants/real estate. and to collect $50B  form city service need atleast $2T  of economic activity. so it is $200K per capita.

The government linked companies of Sg are tasked to manage the city states vast foreign reserves and revenues. Like GIC is managing the foreign reserves. Tell us all, what trade promotion is it when GIC invested multi-billion USDs in Citigroup and purchased multi billion worth of shares into Barclays jointly with China Development bank ?        GIC pumps $9.8b into troubled Citigroup                      Investment is citigroup/barclays which is likely to be half by now.   It shows very significant point that Singpore does not own its own money so it is not prosperity.  In that case it can buy 100 JSF for recycling.
