US central bank accused of unleashing an inflation shock that will rock financial markets, reports Ambrose Evans-Pritchard      &amp;amp;nbsp;    Barclays Capital has advised clients to batten down the hatches for a worldwide financial storm, warning that the US Federal Reserve has allowed the inflation genie out of the bottle and let its credibility fall below zero.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Were in a nasty environment, said Tim Bond, the banks chief equity strategist. There is an inflation shock underway. This is going to be very negative for financial assets. We are going into tortoise mood and are retreating into our shell. Investors will do well if they can preserve their wealth.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    This is the first test for central banks in 30 years and they have fluffed it. They have zero credibility, and the Fed is negative if thats possible. It has lost all credibility, said Mr Bond.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    The bank said the full damage from the global banking crisis would take another year to unfold.
