    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              I think LEH management has found a buyer.  It is selling the company to its EMPLOYEES.   Effectively, isn&amp;#039;t that what they are doing?  By giving their employees the stock?  Isn&amp;#039;t this like a backdoor M&amp;amp;A deal?  Except that the buyers of the company don&amp;#039;t realize that they are buying the company?    LEH management is selling the company piecemeal, rather than in a single, buy under to Barclays.    :O)    In the end, whatever they say, LEH employees, are being made the bagholders.
