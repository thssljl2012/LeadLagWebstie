        QUOTE (Flat Bear &amp;amp;#064; Jun 21 2008, 07&amp;amp;#58;07 PM)       Thought i&amp;#039;d do a quick update on &amp;amp;quot;dodgy&amp;amp;quot; bank shares As of yesterday  B&amp;amp;amp;B @ 69  A&amp;amp;amp;L @ 306  Barclays @ 308  HBOS @ 282  Lloyds @ 327  RBS @ 219  Paragon @ 81p   So the decline in dodgy bank shares continues, but why has RBS kept so high? They&amp;#039;re still above 2.00&amp;amp;#33;  Over the next few weeks they could all be hit harder than the last 3 weeks.  When is the FTSE going to hit 5500 ? and 5000 ?      2 weeks on and a further update (this is an update of an update of an update)  B&amp;amp;amp;B @ 54  -21% A&amp;amp;amp;L @ 268  -12% Barclays @ 278  -10% HBOS @ 273  -3% Lloyds @ 303  -7% RBS @ 205  -6% Paragon @ 57p  -29%  Not falling as much as expected especially HBOS and RBS who are both holding up extremely well.  B&amp;amp;amp;B and Paragon are toast, but we already knew this.  FTSE below 5500 (5423) but when will it hit 5000 ?  June has not seen the collapse in the banking sector I thought would occur.
