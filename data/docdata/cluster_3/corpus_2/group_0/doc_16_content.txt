        QUOTE (garjones &amp;amp;#064; Jul 15 2008, 06&amp;amp;#58;18 AM)       I think a few American banks will be going the way of Anheuser-Busch very soon. I expect Barclays, RBS, HSBC, Bank of China and maybe Deutschebank to come sniffing for a fire sale.    This Chicken Little situation is really bad.  It feels like we&amp;#039;re watching the empire fall apart - wealth and money was the last core industry of the US, but it looks like it&amp;#039;s about to be outsourced too.
