i have been a gold bug for sometime now.it has  treated,i really own only about 5 stocks, because  this market scares the @#$% out of me, today coming  homei was about 25 miles north east of columbus, ohio  and i was just totally amazed at the number of homes  for sale, that really didn,t suprise me , what did  though was how nice they were, with a well kept yard  and mulched and trimmed, if one wasn,t a student of  the market, you would think these poeple really have  money. but do they? or are they mortaged to the hilt?  makes you wonder. all bank stocks in my area are in  the @#$%er, key, huntington, fifth third, national  city, i just don,t know, i only bought visa because i  had bought ma when it ipo,d, made some money and  sold, said this time i would hold, but i am concerned  now. it is a different time for sure.now yesterday  rumors of barclays and we still are not sure of c or  merrill lynch, now gm,maybe chrysler, why in the hell  would that cerebus capitol put robert denarilli[who  was the ceo of home depot and never did @#$% for the  stock, but got something like 200 million bonus when  he left] in charge, they had to have their head up  there  ass.
