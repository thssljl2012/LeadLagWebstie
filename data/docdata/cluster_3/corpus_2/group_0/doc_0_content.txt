    Europe reports US financial meltdown imminent  by  DrKrbyLuv  Sat Jun 28, 2008 at 08:05:30 PM PDT  Two European newspapers reported today that a major global financial crisis is imminent, blaming the US Federal Reserve Bank.  For the past seven years the Bush administration has ran up  huge deficits  and more recently,  flooded the US and the world with liquidity . This was the  reason for the housing bubble   too much money was &amp;quot;created&amp;quot; through predatory loans.  It&amp;#039;s time to consider the unthinkable - a major financial meltdown. - continued below - &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;  DrKrbyLuv&amp;#039;s diary  :: ::&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;   So far, American news sources have largely ignored the real and imminent danger we are facing. The  UKs Telegraph ran a story today:   &amp;quot;Barclays warns of a financial storm as Federal Reserve&amp;#039;s credibility crumbles.&amp;quot; The story goes on to say &amp;quot;US central bank accused of unleashing an inflation shock that will rock financial markets, reports Ambrose Evans-Pritchard.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Barclays Capital has advised clients to batten down the hatches for a worldwide financial storm, warning that the US Federal Reserve has allowed the inflation genie out of the bottle and let its credibility fall &amp;quot;below zero&amp;quot;.  &amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re in a nasty environment,&amp;quot; said Tim Bond, the bank&amp;#039;s chief equity strategist. &amp;quot;There is an inflation shock underway. This is going to be very negative for financial assets. We are going into tortoise mood and are retreating into our shell. Investors will do well if they can preserve their wealth.&amp;quot;  Note the use of the phrase &amp;quot;let its credibility fall &amp;quot;below zero&amp;quot;. I think this implies fraud.  The UK Telegraph also ran an interesting story entitled  The ECB&amp;#039;s eurobankers are beating the Fed at their own game   &amp;quot;We should worry, then, that America&amp;#039;s Commodity Futures Trading Commission - a body with close links to the Fed - last week launched an investigation into commodity traders. This not only shows an important regulatory body to be tackling the wrong problem, but also that it&amp;#039;s ultimately controlled by ignorant, finger-pointing politicians.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;I&amp;#039;m afraid that much the same can be said of the Fed itself. Since sub-prime broke, US rates have dropped 325 basis points - all the way down to 2 per cent - despite headline inflation now running at 4.2 per cent. This is way too lax - and the resulting negative real interest rates will pump inflation higher still.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Earlier this month, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke began to tackle his inflationary demons, suggesting the rate cuts were over, and the next move would be up. The markets took him at his word - and priced in a rate rise, so immediately reining in inflationary pressures.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Within a week, though, the Fed&amp;#039;s resolve was spent. Officials briefed the markets that a rate rise may, in fact, not happen. And last week, Bernanke dropped the ball again. It wasn&amp;#039;t that the Fed kept rates on hold. To have increased now, having cut just weeks ago, would have smelt of panic.&amp;quot;  They arent the only ones sounding alarms, the Dutch newspaper  De Financiele Telegraaf also ran a story today  (sorry, it&amp;#039;s in Dutch) stating that:  &amp;quot;Fortis (large bank in the Netherlands) expects a complete collapse of the US financial markets within a few days to weeks. That explains, according to Fortis, the series of interventions of last Thursday to retrieve  8 billion. &amp;quot;We have been saved just in time. The situation in the US is much worse than we thought&amp;quot;, says Fortis chairman Maurice Lippens. Fortis expects bankruptcies amongst 6000 American banks which have a small coverage currently. But also Citigroup, General Motors, there is starting a complete meltdown in the US.&amp;quot;  My suspicion; this is both  intentional and planned - by the Bush administration and the Fed  to  collapse our currency . After the dollar sinks, it may be replaced by the &amp;quot; Amero .&amp;quot; The  Amero  will end our national financial sovereignty and be the common currency for Canada, Mexico and the US. Thus, clearing the way for the  North American Union .
