         Trust me &amp;amp;#8230;.. I&amp;amp;#8217;m a banker!!  Trust, as we all know it seems to have gone out of the window in the present climate. I watch with amazement when CEOs &amp;amp;#8216;reassure&amp;amp;#8217; the city with positive statements only to see their share price marked down &amp;amp;#8211; almost like a vote of disbelief.  This lack of trust is becoming self fulfilling, in that a lack of investor confidence leads to a lack of customer confidence which could lead to a removal or large scale business with the result being management have to perform an amazing u-turn and admit problems. Bear Stearns is a classic example. Central bankers and governments have pressed banks to be completely transparent, the aim of which to create trust and reduce interbank lending rates.   So far so good.   Banks have responded by declaring their exposure, announcing more writedowns, and raising funds to lift capital ratios.  So, one thing I ask is this... If you were an investor in a bank (Barclays) that had denied it needed to raise capital in February 08 (convincingly so, as it bought back its own shares three months earlier in a buyback programme at 5 per share). Suddenly in June 08, it announces it will re-issue those shares at 2.80 having now admitted it does need capital after all! Would you trust its management?  Let&amp;amp;#8217;s be honest, things can change and everyone is entitled to adapt their plans to changing economic circumstances &amp;amp;#8211; so benefit of doubt so far.  I would however, need reassurances on whether the management are now able to convince me that they are confident in the future - especially as more of my children&amp;amp;#8217;s inheritance is being requested to be pumped into the business.  Why then is this lengthy paragraph inserted into the recent Barclays fundraising document:    &amp;amp;#8220;This announcement contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to certain of the Group&amp;amp;#8217;s plans and its current goals and expectations relating to its future financial condition and performance.  These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts.  Forward-looking statements sometimes use words such as &amp;amp;#8220; may&amp;amp;#8221;, &amp;amp;#8220;will&amp;amp;#8221;, &amp;amp;#8220;seek&amp;amp;#8221;, &amp;amp;#8220;continue&amp;amp;#8221;, &amp;amp;#8220;aim&amp;amp;#8221;, &amp;amp;#8220;anticipate&amp;amp;#8221;, &amp;amp;#8220;target&amp;amp;#8221;, &amp;amp;#8220;expect&amp;amp;#8221;, &amp;amp;#8220;estimate&amp;amp;#8221;, &amp;amp;#8220;intend&amp;amp;#8221;, &amp;amp;#8220;plan&amp;amp;#8221;, &amp;amp;#8220;goal&amp;amp;#8221;, &amp;amp;#8220;believe&amp;amp;#8221; or other words of similar meaning.  Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding the Group&amp;amp;#8217;s future financial position, income growth, impairment charges, business strategy, projected levels of growth in the banking and financial markets, projected costs, estimates of capital expenditures, and plans and objectives for future operations. By their nature, forward- looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances, including, but not limited to, UK domestic and global economic and business conditions, the effects of continued volatility in credit markets, market related risks such as changes in interest rates and exchange rates, the policies and actions of governmental and regulatory authorities, changes in legislation, the further development of standards and interpretations under IFRS applicable to past, current and future periods, evolving practices with regard to the interpretation and application of standards under IFRS, the outcome of pending and future litigation, the success of future acquisitions and other strategic transactions and the impact of competition &amp;amp;#8211; a number of which factors are beyond the Group&amp;amp;#8217;s control.  As a result, the Group&amp;amp;#8217;s actual future results may differ materially from the plans, goals, and expectations set forth in the Group&amp;amp;#8217;s forward-looking statements.  Any forward-looking statements made herein speak only as of the date they are made.  Except as required by the FSA, the London Stock Exchange or applicable law, Barclays expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any  forward-looking statements contained in this announcement to reflect any change in Barclays expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.  You can see this for yourself on page 8 of this:   http://www.investorrelations.barclays.co.uk/INV/A/Content/Fi...   I understand companies have to contain wording in statements to prevent litigation cases etc but I have to say that they seem to have covered their backs with every conceivable eventuality including the part that reads:   &amp;amp;#8220;As a result, the Group&amp;amp;#8217;s actual future results may differ materially from the plans, goals, and expectations set forth in the Group&amp;amp;#8217;s forward-looking statements.  Any forward-looking statements made herein speak only as of the date they are made.&amp;amp;#8221;  In other words, as of tomorrow, this statement is out of date and potentially useless.   Is it surprising that banks aren&amp;amp;#8217;t lending to one another at the moment? Incidentally, the day after this announcement was published, Citi produced a report suggesting Barclays may need to raise another 9bn - the share price promptly fell below the offer price. Hardly surprising is it?  I for one say that we need to get back to basics and instill trust and confidence once more. Until we do, there will only be more self-fulfilling disasters waiting to happen.  As ever, this is only my opinion  Steve
