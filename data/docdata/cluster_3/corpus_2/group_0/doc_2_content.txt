that money is lent to very credit worthy people.        maybe.   hopefully.   but 10-20B seems too high.    if MTG and the others are wipeouts, you basically  need to figure out what the capital base was and then  assume that&amp;#039;s what aig will lose.   its not a matter  of losing most of face  value.
