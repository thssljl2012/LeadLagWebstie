    paul:  Listen I m just a public information service.  I m just saying what the top people in the banking industry are saying.  Do you think somehow you know something they don t ? i don t think so somehow..  By the way you don t want to hear what Barclays bank the 2nd largest in the UK with huge worldwide assets are saying about the future of the u s economy in their latest financial reports to investors...   maybe their a bunch of morons also and they don t know what they re talking about?    http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/06/2 7/cnbarclays127.xml  There ya go.  Nothing close to the catastrophe that you are calling and he is calling it WORLD WIDE, more so in Asia than in America.  Then at the end they mention everyone else in the banking industry thinks he is wrong in his analysis.
