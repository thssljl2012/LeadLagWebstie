 I had a brainwave  when Westpac/St George Merger hit the headlines.       I &amp;#039;banked&amp;amp;quot; (excuse the pun ) on Bank West taking St George&amp;#039;s spot as one of the Big Four. Until I did my research and found out Bank West was actually parented by HBOS in the UK.       There went that idea......Thank goodness!       Regards JO
