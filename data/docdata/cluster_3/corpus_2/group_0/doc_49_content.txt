          Wednesday July 16, 10:30 AM Broker snap: HSBC adds to HBOS, Barclays pain  LONDON (ShareCast) - There was more woe for HBOS and Barclays after HSBC lowered its rating on the banks to &amp;#039;underweight&amp;#039; and cut their price targets amid further credit crunch worries.   It cuts its target on HBOS, on which it used to have an &amp;#039;overweight&amp;#039; rating, to 840p from 1,250p.  Barclays, which it used to rate as &amp;#039;neutral&amp;#039;, sees its target price fall to 580p from 700p   I think you&amp;#039;ll find that relates to July 16th,  2007  - after all, I&amp;#039;m pretty sure we&amp;#039;d love to see Barclays at 580p and HBOS at 840p !!
