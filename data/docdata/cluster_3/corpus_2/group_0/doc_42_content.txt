The appointment is the strongest indication yet that Taylor Wimpey believes it may be able hammer out a deal with lenders without having to restart its failed equity raising.  Rothschild negotiated a similar deal on behalf of Taylor Wimpey&amp;#039;s rival Barratt Developments earlier this month and the two housebuilders are largely funded by the same lenders.  Taylor Wimpey&amp;#039;s market value of 528m is dwarfed by its 1.7bn debt mountain. The company has admitted it is at risk of breaching its banking covenants within the next seven months and desperately needs to work out a solution with its lenders by Christmas. # More on construction  Britain is experiencing its lowest level of mortgage lending in more than a decade, leaving housebuilders with thousands of houses they cannot sell and the property market is not expected to recover for years.  Taylor Wimpey initially asked shareholders to stump up cash to re-capitalise its balance sheet, but had to pull the fundraising last month when hedge fund investors refused to back the bailout.  Rothschild&amp;#039;s debt advisory team will also work alongside Taylor Wimpey&amp;#039;s existing corporate advisers, JPMorgan Cazenove and UBS, to find it a re-financing deal. The company is believed to have held parallel talks with a number of private equity houses about providing new debt finance.  Sources said Taylor Wimpey is now unlikely to reach a deal with lenders before its interim results statement on August 27, but that its advisers hope to agree a covenant waiver by the end of September.  Of Taylor Wimpey&amp;#039;s 1.7bn debt, 825m comes from a combination of publicly traded Eurobonds and privately placed US loan notes, which are owned by US financial institutions and pension funds. The rest comes from a banking syndicate of Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland.  The bank debt and the US private loan notes have interest cover covenants which look set to be breached because of falling property prices. Rothschild will need an agreement from both the banks and loan note holders to get a covenant waiver.     Doesn&amp;#039;t look good&amp;amp;#33;  In the Independent  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business...out-875843.html   &amp;amp;quot;Yesterday the British Bankers&amp;#039; Association said that the number of mortgages approved for house purchases dropped by more than two thirds in the year to June; at 21,118 it is at its lowest level for at least a decade.  Some analysts are even suggesting the extinction of new mortgages by the end of the year. Malcolm Barr, UK economist at JP Morgan, commented: &amp;amp;quot;If the rate of decline is sustained, this time series will approach zero in a handful of months&amp;#039; time.&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;        This post has been edited by  Ash4781 : Yesterday, 05:55 AM
