          This is an absolutely rotten deal and one Barclays directors should be thoroughly ashamed of   It is certainly a good deal for the directors. They won&amp;#039;t have the government telling them who to lend to. Whether it is such a good deal for shareholders is more problematic. We don&amp;#039;t know what the real cost of the HMG shareholding in the other banks will be. At least Barclay owners will get a dividend next year. My guess it will be more than the shareholders think if RBS and Lloyds sell assets quickly, and badly, to repay the prefs. The FT thinks more government is the solution to everything so its dislike of the deal is not surprising.   McEssex
