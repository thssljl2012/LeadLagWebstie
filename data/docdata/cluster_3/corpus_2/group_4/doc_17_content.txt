         Passing IR cuts?  Yeah, right...   http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/article-1083711/Lenders-rai...   British banks may need to raise billions more in fresh capital to see them through the gathering economic crisis, a leading City analyst has warned.   In a bleak prognosis for the UK banking industry, Jonathan Pierce of Credit Suisse said Britain&amp;#039;s main High Street lenders are &amp;#039;staring into the abyss&amp;#039;.  An early 1990s-style recession could even see the big four banks  -  HBOS, Lloyds TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays  -  plunge into the red next year.  By then, the property rot could have eaten away Chancellor Alistair Darling&amp;#039;s 37billion rescue package. This could &amp;#039;potentially reignite capital concerns at one or more of the banks&amp;#039;, Pierce warned.   Coming on a day that the Bank of England hit the panic button with an unprecedented one-and-half-point interest rate cut, Pierce&amp;#039;s warning cemented fears that lenders will suffer for a long time to come.
