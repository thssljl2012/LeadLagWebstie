         Sadly I hold LLOY and RBS. Thankfully not BARC and BARC have again proved why not. At least with my holdings I can Average down. BARC have done placing after placing and basically dumped all over private investors with one dilution after another. this deal stinks and is not a surprise. they have in my view more ddgy assets that they still have not written down anything like RBS. BARC looks dodgy to me and so do the management. At east with LLOY/RBS HMG put a floor on them for now and at least with LLOY I think they will long term be getting a good deal with HBOS for shareholders.
