          I very much hope it falls much, much further and that they end up having to take UK gov cash at a share price of 50p.   Why?  You seem to be willing a major UK Bank to fail  From whtt I saw the SP rallied after the announcement but then fell when the cost of the deal became more clear. It seems that Barclays would rather take the more expensive deal than take partial nationalisation.
