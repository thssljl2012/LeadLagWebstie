         This is an absolutely rotten deal and one Barclays directors should be thoroughly ashamed of. There were a few Lloyds shareholders moaning about how clever Barclays had been in rejecting HMG terms and I highlighted that they might well to live to regret it.   http://boards.fool.co.uk/Message.asp?mid=11274486&amp;amp;amp;sort=u...    Lloyds needs money, with or without Government help. I believe Barclays may have been reckless in turning up their nose at the deal, especially since there is little tangible benefit to shareholders in turning it down if they are going to have to dilute anyway.  Lloyds shareholders are at much greater risk than they have been historically as a result of the HBOS deal but it&amp;#039;s not nearly as bad as it was. The government is putting money into HBOS at much higher levels which should cope with appreciable write-offs and the combined entity will be highly solvent. This wasn&amp;#039;t the case before.  I&amp;#039;m not saying that I would buy the shares but they are a much better buy with the government intervention ( and 17b injection) than they were without.  Barclays will drop further IMHO, and they might live to regret going down their own route.   It seems to me that Barclays&amp;#039; directors have let their egos rank ahead of shareholder&amp;#039;s interests - the dividend issue is a smokescreen, IMHO. This deal is clearly aimed at keeping bad debts under wraps for a s long as possible and avoiding further writedowns which have to be disclosed with a rights issue. Oh, and maximising executive pay, of course.  I think it&amp;#039;s a bloody disgrace.  WShak
