         More here:   http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7703908.stm   There was also something yesterday on Peston&amp;#039;s blog about &amp;#039;more news next week&amp;#039; on the Lloyds/HBOS takeover.  This will show whether LLOY is strong enough to stand on it&amp;#039;s own and ask shareholders for the extra capital it requires, rather than get into bed with HMG.  As long as they don&amp;#039;t go down the route that Barclays has chosen.  gk
