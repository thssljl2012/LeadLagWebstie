                   Hey, when we&amp;#039;re teaming up with other nations to kill &amp;#039;em, we kill &amp;#039;em, but when we&amp;#039;re on our knees,  they  come running to our rescue - what a friendship, eh ?        ----------------------           Quote:                           Banking giant Barclays said Middle Eastern investors were pumping up to 7.3 billion into the business.       The cash injection from Qatari investors and the Abu Dhabi royal family comes as the bank looks to avoid calling on taxpayer funds to strengthen finances weakened by the credit crunch.      Barclays has also brought on board Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan - a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family - as a substantial new investor.      Barclays said the funding move would allow it to meet the tougher requirements of the Financial Services Authority to help banks withstand financial turmoil.                      http://uk.news.yahoo.com/21/20081031...s-6323e80.html
