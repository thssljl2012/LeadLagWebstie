         Precinct13,  &amp;amp;quot; The story is not fully out yet, but in summary... the UK government is bailing out banks... the government is forcing some of the weaker ones to take UK/EU money (with all of it&amp;#039;s rules and stipulations). Barclays refused to take cash on these stipulations, in fact the chairman of Barclays got down on his knees (literally) before Brown and begged not to have to take this UK/EU funding (and hence state control).  Now as an altenative to Brown, they have sold 1/3rd of their share-cap to Qatar/Abu-Dhabi.  There goes another slab of a British company, to foreign ownership. I think New Labour cruising in throwing down the diktats for how banks must run some form of socialist banking coopertive did no favours, as evidenced by those with a choice, tieing up elsewhere.  Any other views?  &amp;amp;quot;    Yup, you&amp;#039;ve got your facts wrong.  The Gov is  not  forcing  forcing some of the weaker ones to take UK/EU money .  All are in the same position - raise funds privately to meet the new capital ratios or ask the gov for the cash.  Barclays refused to take gov cash (RBS are paying 12% on pref shares fo 5 years) and instead decided to take ME cash and paying  14%  for  11  years ( plus  potentially billions of &amp;#039;s worth of warrants).  IOW, Barclays would rather foreign money than UK or current shareholder money.  Their share price has fallen 18.5% today - I very much hope it falls much,  much  further and that they end up having to take UK gov cash at a share price of 50p.  awbMaven
