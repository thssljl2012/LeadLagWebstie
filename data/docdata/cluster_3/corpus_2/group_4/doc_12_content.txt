Last month, the British Government offered a multi-billion dollar rescue package to the UK&amp;#039;s biggest banks.    Most took up the offer, but Barclays did not want to accept a bail-out from the Government.    Instead  the bank has raised $18 billion from the Middle East .                     Do anyone see  hope for British Aircraft still??
