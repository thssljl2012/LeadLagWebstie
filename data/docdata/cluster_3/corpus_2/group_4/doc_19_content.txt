          Unfortunately I can&amp;#039;t remember seeing what price the Middle East investors are paying for ordinary shares but given the recent falls in Barclays SP I wouldn&amp;#039;t be surprised if you could purchase them cheaper on the open market even with stamp duty etc.   All depends what is on offer:  3bn Reserve Capital Instruments - 14% payable until June 2019 and then 13.4% above 3 month LIBOR until the RICs are redeemed. These are for Qatar Holding and HH Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan only.  In conjunction with this issue the to middle east investors have subscribed to 3bn of warrants (at a nominal cost) to subscribe to ordinary shares at an option price of 197.775 up until 31 October 2013.  4.05bn Mandatorily Convertible Notes due 2009. Interest payable at 9.75% until the MCNs are converted on 30 June 2009 into ordinary shares at 153.276p per share. Again mainly taken up by the two middle east investors with 1.25bn going to institutional investors.  I wouldn&amp;#039;t mind some of the MCNs and would be happy to stick some money in the RICs purely for the income.  To add insult to injury the middle east investors are being paid commission for their commitments.
