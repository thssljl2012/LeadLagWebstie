         With all the anger and discontent of shareholders over the actions of the Barclays board I find myself with 2 questions.  1.  Is this deal subject to shareholder approval?  If so, when is it proposed to be put to the vote?  2.  Why don&amp;#039;t the smaller shareholders (myself included) demand an extraordinary  general meeting on a Vote of No Confidence in the board.  If sufficient swell can be created it might, just might, make the board take the interests of their shareholders more seriously.
