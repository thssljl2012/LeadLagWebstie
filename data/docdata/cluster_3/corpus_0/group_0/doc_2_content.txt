(NOK), Amer Intl Group (AIG), Wachovia Corp (WB), Alcatel-LucentADS (ALU)MOST NOTEWORTHY: Wachovia, American International Group and BT Group were today's noteworthy downgrades:        Oppenheimer downgraded shares of Wachovia (NYSE: WB) to Underperform from Perform as they believe the outlook is "bleak" for equity shareholders. The firm thinks Wachovia's expenses can't come down fast enough too offset earnings erosion.      Wachovia downgraded shares of American International Group (NYSE: AIG) to Market Perform from Outperform as they believe AIG's CDO valuations worsened in Q2, which could result in a $2B-$7B after tax "valuation adjustment." Wachovia expects the value of AIG's core insurance franchise to be obscured by its credit exposure.      Collins Stewart cut BT Group (NYSE: BT) to Hold from Buy on concerns surrounding the company's fiber network expansion.  OTHER DOWNGRADES:       Nokia (NYSE: NOK) was downgraded to Add from Buy at WestLB; the firm also lowered Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) to Hold from Buy and Alcatel-Lucent (NYSE: ALU) to Sell from Hold.
