 In cased you missed it, the U.S. economy is falling apart left and right and now, large banks are taking the hit.This weekend,major financial institution IndyMac Bancorp collapsed, causing lines to snake around corners at it's various locations in North America as customers tried to retrieve their savings.According to the AP, IndyMac Bank's assets were seized by federal regulators on Friday after the mortgage lender succumbed to the pressures of tighter credit, tumbling home prices and rising foreclosures. The bank is the largest regulated thrift to fail and the second largest financial institution to close in U.S. history.You know what?  I really wish BOA would tell a whole bunch of uppity black folks  that they collapsed and put a sign on the door that they were closed.  And that they lost their money.  Because you know black people llllooovvveee BOA.And we looooovovveee having that status-symbol photo ID Debit Card (NOT Credit!)Please trust, every BOA in the Northern hemisphere would be done, 50 Cent and his goons would have nothing on a bunch of angry UBF's trying to retrieve their hard-earned cash!Pure tomfoolery.
