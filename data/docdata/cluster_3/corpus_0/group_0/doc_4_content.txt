HAGERTY July 29, 2008; Page D1 The number of homes on the market is finally falling in much of the U.S., but tight credit and a flood of foreclosures are still pushing home prices down. Making things worse, a sputtering economy is destroying jobs. That means even more foreclosures and fewer potential home buyers. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody&amp;#8217;s Corp. Economy.com, says he doesn&amp;#8217;t expect a major rebound in home sales and prices before the spring of 2010. &amp;#8220;The recovery will vary considerably across the country, with California recovering quickly and Florida much more slowly,&amp;#8221; Mr. Zandi says. &amp;#8220;We have the added weight of a recessionary economy&amp;#8221; on what was already the weakest housing market since the 1930s, says Jeffrey Otteau, president of Otteau Valuation Group, an East Brunswick, N.J., appraisal firm. He says the market won&amp;#8217;t recover fully until employment starts growing again and credit becomes more readily available. The Wall Street Journal&amp;#8217;s quarterly survey of housing data in 28 major metropolitan areas showed that the supply of homes listed for sale declined from a year earlier in 19 of them. (See table on the back page.) If that trend continues, it will signal an eventual rebound. For now, though, supplies remain so ample that potential buyers generally can take their time. &amp;#8230; Perhaps the biggest factor pushing down home prices is the growing glut of foreclosed homes that banks and mortgage investors must sell. In May, such homes accounted for nearly 22% of all sales nationwide, Barclays Capital estimates in a report released last week. In California, Arizona and Nevada, the share was around 40%. There are about 721,000 foreclosed homes on the market nationwide, up from 112,000 two years ago, Barclays Capital estimates. Analysts at Barclays expect the total to rise 60% before peaking in late 2009. &amp;#8230; Many potential buyers are on the sidelines because they no longer qualify for a mortgage under today&amp;#8217;s tougher standards. &amp;#8220;They&amp;#8217;re having to clean their credit up&amp;#8221; and save for a down payment, says John Wood, who owns Re/Max Partners, which operates in the Raleigh, N.C., area. &amp;#8220;That is certainly hurting our market.&amp;#8221; Those who can get a loan are finding it more expensive. Rates for 30-year fixed loans that conform with the standards of Fannie and Freddie last week averaged 6.69%, up from 6.55% a month before and about even with the year-earlier level, according to surveys by HSH Associates, a financial publisher. For &amp;#8220;jumbo&amp;#8221; mortgages, those too large to be purchased by Fannie or Freddie, rates last week averaged 7.70%, up from 7.65% a month earlier and 7.02% a year before, HSH says. As always, the market varies considerably from city to city and even block to block. The most attractive neighborhoods with short commutes and excellent schools are holding up well. &amp;#8230; Manhattan, a market that until recently seemed immune to the housing slump, is suffering from the loss of Wall Street jobs and expected cuts in bonuses. A modest price fall in 2009 is &amp;#8220;a distinct possibility&amp;#8221; for Manhattan, says Jonathan Miller, chief executive officer of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm based in New York. Jeffrey Jackson, chief economist at the appraisal firm Mitchell, Maxwell &amp;#038; Jackson, says prices already have fallen on mediocre Manhattan apartments &amp;#8212; such as those that have little natural light or need repairs &amp;#8212; and are likely to fall further. &amp;#8220;Demand is very weak right now,&amp;#8221; he says.
