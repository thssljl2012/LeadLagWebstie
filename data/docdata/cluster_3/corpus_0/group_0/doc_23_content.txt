It will be hard for the U.S. and UK to avoid a depression. What started as a tropical storm called &amp;#8220;subprime&amp;#8221; has intensified in magnitude to engulf Alt-A mortgages, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), credit cards, commercial real estate, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and the stock market - just as baby boomers are headed for retirement. Barclays Warns Of Financial Storm Most do not even understand the nature of the storm that is about to hit. Barclays (BCS) is right at the top of the list. Barclays Capital has advised clients to batten down the hatches for a worldwide financial storm, warning that the US Federal Reserve has allowed the inflation genie out of the bottle and let its credibility fall &amp;#8220;below zero.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re in a nasty environment,&amp;#8221; said Tim Bond, the bank&amp;#8217;s chief equity strategist. &amp;#8220;There is an inflation shock underway. This is going to be very negative for financial assets. We are going into tortoise mood and are retreating into our shell. Investors will do well if they can preserve their wealth.&amp;#8221; Barclays Capital said in its closely-watched Global Outlook that US headline inflation would hit 5.5pc by August and the Fed will have to raise interest rates six times by the end of next year to prevent a wage-spiral. If it hesitates, the bond markets will take matters into their own hands. &amp;#8220;This is the first test for central banks in 30 years and they have fluffed it. They have zero credibility, and the Fed is negative if that&amp;#8217;s possible. It has lost all credibility,&amp;#8221; said Mr Bond. I don&amp;#8217;t see things quite as dire as MIsh but, as I&amp;#8217;ve been saying for months, things are getting scary out there. On Thursday we get the June Employment report. If it&amp;#8217;s a ugly as I think it&amp;#8217;s going to be we&amp;#8217;re in for a crazy ride before the holiday. And although I don&amp;#8217;t know how right Mish is going to be he&amp;#8217;s at least directionally correct: Implications of Peak Credit  When it comes to the collapse in credit, the central banks above are powerless to do a thing about it. That&amp;#8217;s to be expected, now that we&amp;#8217;re on the backside of peak credit. The saturation point has been reached. It took decades, but we&amp;#8217;ve finally arrived. None of the financial engineering jobs that fueled this credit boom will ever be needed again. Structured investment vehicles (SIVs), conduits, toggle bonds and covenant-lite loans will be dead for years &amp;#8212; if not decades &amp;#8212; to come. Add to that liar loans, pay-option ARMs, insane leverage and numerous other ridiculous lending arrangements. If those things aren&amp;#8217;t coming back, we don&amp;#8217;t need Wall Street shills to securitize the garbage and pitch it to unsuspecting suckers. In addition to financial engineering jobs, there was a boom in commercial real estate, home depots, remodeling companies, landscaping, furniture, appliances, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, restaurants - and even things like grass seed. There&amp;#8217;s no source of jobs to replace what has been lost, nor what will be lost. Discretionary spending is dead. Boomers about to retire are about to get religion, but sadly, it&amp;#8217;s too late: Savings they thought they had have now vanished into thin air. It was all a mirage in the first place, but mountains of credit has been extended on the basis of that mirage. Trillions of dollars of imagined wealth has gone up in smoke. Trillions of dollars more are about to. He offers us this rather disturbing chart:  Yup. HELOCs have doubled in delinquency rates. Credit cards are next. We&amp;#8217;re in the 3rd inning rather than the 7th.
