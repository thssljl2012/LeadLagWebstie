 We&amp;#8217;ve probably given the topic of emissions trading a fair going over of late.&amp;nbsp; (Ya think?)  As it stands, the next phase of the debate starts after we digest the Garnaut interim report due tomorrow, and then Penny Wong&amp;#8217;s Green Paper next week.&amp;nbsp; This is a huge amount to digest and I for one haven&amp;#8217;t really come to terms with all the ramifications or made up my mind about the best way to proceed (that&amp;#8217;s why I think it&amp;#8217;s good to open it for discussion).   Nonetheless, there some pieces that have turned up overnight that are probably worth your attention.   First up, the government released its discussion paper on greenhouse mitigations strategies for the energy sector.&amp;nbsp; Robert Merkel gives it some attention in this response.   Opposition environment spokesperson Greg Hunt outlines the latest version of the Coalition&amp;#8217;s policy.&amp;nbsp; There&amp;#8217;s actually a lot I agree with, but I suspect that is because it is pretty airy-fairy, getting into motherhood statement territory.&amp;nbsp; It also has some serious flaws, some of which Joshua Gans deals with here.&amp;nbsp; Still, this is an important article and I&amp;#8217;ll give it more attention at some point.   The Business Council of Australia is supporting an emissions trading scheme, though the key point they seem to want to make is that there should be few exemptions.&amp;nbsp; You can see why: as we&amp;#8217;ve said before, if you exempt one industry you are probably just putting more expense on the others.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, the article just flags a speech being made today by the head of the BCA and that will be the important thing to read. They note: &amp;#8220;Mr Gailey will adopt a tone of optimism with the assurance that the business community understands the need for change and is looking for government decisions that will provide incentives and support to deliver a shift to a low-emissions economy.&amp;#8221;   That should keep you in the emissionary position for a while....   UPDATE:&amp;nbsp; A couple more.&amp;nbsp; Ken Parish proposes &amp;#8220;a 50% reduction in company tax on profits generated from the first seven years of sales of any locally developed fuel, power generation or transport propulsion technology that delivers substantial savings in carbon emissions over current technologies, as well as extended profit retention as long as profits are invested in further research and development of carbon-reducing energy-related technologies.&amp;#8221;  (Via comments)   Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbon offers an approach different to that likely to put forward by Ross Garnaut.&amp;nbsp; McKibbon is another of those whose advice the government is considering.&amp;nbsp; He says: &amp;#8220;What is needed is a hybrid approach of long-term emissions trading with 100 years of future carbon prices along a carbon yield curve, but a short-term fixed price for carbon. This is how monetary policy works in Australia. The short-term interest rate (carbon price) is set by an independent authority within a framework based on an inflation goal (long-term concentration goal) set by the government but a long-term bond market (long-term carbon market) guiding long-term investment decisions given the goals of policy and the stance of the Reserve Bank of Australia (carbon bank).&amp;#8221;   It&amp;#8217;s good to see the public discussion picking up (and improving) on the topic.   ANOTHERY: I&amp;#8217;d missed this Mike Steketee piece.&amp;nbsp; Not only is optimistic in tone&amp;#8212;very rare on this topic&amp;#8212;he also points to the positive approach being taken in California by Arnold Schwarzenegger:   In Australia, we agonise about the pain of cutting emissions by 60 per cent from 2000 levels by 2050.&amp;nbsp; Schwarzenegger reckons that is for wimps: he is committed to an 80 per cent cut by 2050 and 25 per cent by 2020, and that is from 1990 levels. He wants to get there through a mix of regulation and market mechanisms.   ...WE have been altogether too gloomy about climate change. Just look at the fun Arnold Schwarzenegger is having in California, which contains the sixth largest economy in the world. Where Australian politicians see only risks, the Governator sees opportunities.   Last month he hailed the arrival of the environmental revolution as the successor of the industrial and technological revolutions.   &amp;#8220;Right now the most innovative scientists, venture capitalists and companies are racing to find and to implement new technologies for alternative energy. It is fantastic ... The Wall Street Journal called it &amp;#8216;California&amp;#8217;s new gold rush&amp;#8217;. Capitalism, the long-alleged enemy of the environment, is today giving new life to the environmental movement.&amp;#8221;   Contrast that with Australia&amp;#8217;s very own jeremiah, Brendan Nelson, who warned on Tuesday that &amp;#8220;Mr Rudd is at risk of doing enormous damage to our country&amp;#8217;s economic future&amp;#8221; in his response to climate change.
