 This weekend the Treasury Department announced a three-part emergency plan to insure that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are able to stay solvent.Still, the IndyMac failure, a bank run triggered by a letter by Charles Schumer, has apparently left folks greatly concerned about the safety of other mortgage-lending institutions.  As I write this this morning, even premier banks are taking hits--Bank of America is down 4%, Wells Fargo is down nearly 5%, the Bank of New York/Mellon is down 3%, Citigroup 4%, and so on.  Significant, but not scary in and of itself.One exception is FirstFed, whose value is down over a third in the last few hours.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;   It's hard to watch a decrease in the market-estimated value of a bank of that size without starting to wonder about the security of funds in those banks.
