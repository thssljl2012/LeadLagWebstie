"Clearly, the pendulum had swung a little too far in terms of flexibility in underwriting," says Len Sweeney, chief risk officer for AIG United Guaranty, the mortgage-insurance unit of American International Group Inc. "Some of the movement we've made of late is back to a more prudent approach."Michael Zimmerman, a spokesman for industry leader MGIC Investment Corp., says, "So far, we're only losing the business that we no longer want to write.
