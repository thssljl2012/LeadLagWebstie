I am in the process of a Ch. 7 bankruptcy and one of the debts was Bank of America, which I included in the debt matrix. I pulled my credit report today and found LVNV Funding LLC on it for the amount (well, a couple of hundred extra tacked on) with the status being andquot;in collectionsandquot;. Should I amend the Ch. 7 and add LVNV Funding LLC to it when the original debt is already on it? If I do, what's to stop them from moving it over to one of their other sleazebag operations? Help, please.  DRoy
