The WSJ economist survey showed Duncan Douglas of MBA has dropped off the survey and MBA seems to have a new chief economist Jay Brinkman.&amp;nbsp; Duncan had gained entrance into the Hall by violating the rules of forecasters as laid out here. Duncan&amp;nbsp;had moved from a 40% chance of recession in January&amp;nbsp;to 60% in March and locked it in at 90% in May, but then&amp;nbsp;didn't stick to his guns and retreated to 40% in June.&amp;nbsp;Soon after he was replaced by Jim Brickman.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; MBA wants&amp;nbsp;us to forget the embarrassing 40% call in June so&amp;nbsp;they list Jim's 90% call in June and his 70% call in July.&amp;nbsp;  Having two official forecasts (especially one saying recession and one saying no recession) is&amp;nbsp;sort of like ESPN's Superbowl predictions. At the beginning of the year they made 16 different Superbowl pairing preditions&amp;nbsp;hoping to get one combination correct, and if they did, they'd certainly trumpet they "predicted it" and hope you forget about the 15 alternative predictions. Eventually someone will predict all 256 possible pairings and thus guarantee they "know" the right answer. So how's the rest of the class?&amp;nbsp;  Mike Cosgrove of Econoclast&amp;nbsp;is now a full member.&amp;nbsp; He now officially thinks a recession is less likey than an expansion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; He was at all but certain 90% in April that we were or would be in a recession. John Silva continues to shock me.&amp;nbsp; He might be the first economist to ever break rule number 4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Recall John was at a "what recession?" 30% chance in December 2007, moved to "all but certain" 95% in March, quickly slipped to "probably not" 45% in May and descended back to "what&amp;nbsp;recession?" 25% in June.&amp;nbsp; But in July he moved back to "probably not" 40%.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; He's already gone 15% back towards recession, another 11% move and he officially breaks rule #4. &amp;nbsp; We also have 2 new members on the watch list. Laurence Yun has now stuck the NAR forecast at 50% in April and now again in July.&amp;nbsp; He was at 35% in June.&amp;nbsp; I've rallied many times against ever having a 50% forecast. Joel Prakken of MA shocked me last month lowering his forecast to 15%.&amp;nbsp; Essentially saying there is no chance of a recession.&amp;nbsp; That alone isn't a problem, but he was at 45% in April and he's at 47% now in July.&amp;nbsp; Which is it Joel?&amp;nbsp; A close call or not? Lastly, the WSJ showed a major change in forecast for two economists. Mickey Levy of Bank of America moves from 25% chance of recession in June to 80% chance in July.&amp;nbsp;  Daniel Laufberg of Ameriprise moves from 50% chance of recession in June to 70% chance in July.&amp;nbsp;  Welcome to the pessimistic (and I believe realistic)&amp;nbsp;camp gentlemen.
