The markets took a major fall Wednesday as credit worries -- especially at mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which may need billions of dollars of fresh capital -- continue to weigh on the minds of investors. The worries helped ignite a flight from financial stocks and the markets as the Dow plunged 236.77, or 2.08%, to 11,147.44 while the Nasdaq slipped 59.50, or 2.60%, to 2,234.89.Freddie Mac [FRE] fell $3.20, or 23.77%, to $10.26, and Fannie Mae [FNM] fell $2.31, or 13.11%, to $15.31 on renewed fears of their capital positions. The mortgage finance firms fell on credit-default swaps tied to the companies' $1.45 trillion of AAA-rated debt, which were trading at levels that suggest the bonds should be rated A2 by Moody's Investors Service, Bloomberg reported, citing data compiled by Moody's credit strategy group.  Meanwhile, Northwest Airlines Corp. [NWA] dipped nearly 16% following job reductions of 2,500 frontline and management positions, citing rising fuel costs prior to its impending merger with Delta Airlines Inc. Merger partner Delta has made similiar cuts to cut costs.  Lastly, Zarlink Semiconductor Inc. [ZL] was one of the few stocks that saw the green, rising nearly 11% on a rejection of a dissident shareholder plan by the three incumbent directors named as nominees in the proxy. Adam Chowaniec, Hubert T. Lacroix and J. Spencer Lanthier have "advised that they have never consented to and will not consent to serve with the five individuals nominated by the dissident shareholder group." - Gerald Magpily      Troubled Wall Street   Name Open Last price Change Mkt cap  J.P.
