When you invest money you usually have a choice.  You can invest your money in something directly.  A good example of this is purchasing an individual company share.  Alternatively, you can invest in a collective investment fund and allow a fund manager to invest in a wider range of company shares.  This second option appears to be the most popular these days.  Some research from Barclays found that the majority (almost two thirds) of investors invest in funds to achieve a diversified portfolio.     It is reassuring to see that, given current investment market conditions, investors recognise the importance of diversification.  Spreading your investments between the different asset classes often results in less risk without a substantial reduction in the potential long term reward.    Investing in a single investment type or asset class is almost always a high risk strategy, even if the actual investment itself is considered to be fairly low risk.  Kindest regards, Martin
