By Julie Dalla-Costa Famed alumni of Julian Robertson&amp;#8217;s Tiger Management, as well as the numerous funds he seeds through a platform he started after closing his hedge fund shop in 2000, are haunted by one issue: &amp;#8220;The persistent view is that we all own the same stocks,&amp;#8221; says Philippe Laffont, who left his role as telecom analyst at Tiger in mid-1999 to start his own firm, Coatue Management. Last year&amp;#8217;s lofty returns by many of the 70-some-odd members of the extended Tiger family raised the collaboration issue - and a few eyebrows - once again. Like Coatue, which returned 51.5% to investors last year and now has $2.5 billion, many Tiger funds profited from their tech holdings in Google, Apple, RIM, Qualcomm and Baidu.com. Others, including Robertson himself, were among the coterie of hedge fund luminaries who did well by shorting financials. This year, those same holdings have led many Tigers to post losses, while others are benefiting from another common theme: shorting China. Views about the Tigers tend to the extremes - either they are simply genius investors, trained in value analysis, trading techniques and shorting skills at the feet of the master, or they are plotting, like some secret cabal, to take over the hedge fund world. Both of these perspectives may be exaggerations. But given that the Tigers account for around 5% of the $2.6 trillion in global hedge fund assets, and an even greater percentage - around 11% - of global equity long/short assets, the nagging concern about crossholdings, communications and collaborations is one that won&amp;#8217;t go away. The truth appears to lie somewhere in between. &amp;#8220;There are a lot of cubs&amp;#8230;so of course there is some overlap,&amp;#8221; says Laffont, who argues that the cubs are fiercely competitive and thus fiercely independent. &amp;#8220;If we own the same stocks, it&amp;#8217;s because we came to the same conclusions.&amp;#8221; Others acknowledge they are part of a tightly knit group that speaks often, and the talk quickly turns to stocks. &amp;#8220;There are some ex-Tiger guys that I talk to on a weekly basis and others every one to three months,&amp;#8221; says top-performing Tiger cub Rob Citrone, who founded $3.6 billion emerging markets&amp;#8217; shop Discovery Capital Management in 1999 and whose fund gained 57.3% last year, according to an investor. &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s respect among a lot of us. It&amp;#8217;s a benefit to be able to discuss ideas.&amp;#8221; (Citrone has also worked with George Soros and has managed part of Quantum&amp;#8217;s portfolio for the past eight years.) And that&amp;#8217;s just the cubs, the 40 or so managers who worked at Tiger before it shut down. The so-called seeds, the 29 managers whose funds operate under the Tiger Management umbrella - many of whom share offices at 101 Park Avenue in New York - have a more formal network and a forum for communication. Most have some kind of profit-sharing agreement with Robertson, who typically holds a 10% to 15% stake in the firms under his umbrella. Robertson is a mentor for the managers and chairs fortnightly meetings where ideas are discussed in detail. A recent one focused on the prospects for China. Last year&amp;#8217;s short subprime financial trade also came out of such meetings, with early advocates being instrumental in shaping the group&amp;#8217;s negative view. Several investors credit Tiger seed Chris Burn, at financial stock specialist Goshen Investments, for the idea. Goshen gained 55.6% last year and was up 14.9% this year through May, according to an investor. Others say Tom Facciola, who runs TigerShark, and Dan Sperrazza and Glenn Migliozzi of Green Eagle, the principle credit long/short manager in the group, also played a role. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s a classic example of these guys collaborating,&amp;#8221; says one investor. Green Eagle is up 9.2% through May, another good showing. There is no evidence that the Tigers are doing anything illegal. &amp;#8220;Generally, you would need to prove they were working as a group with the intent to target a specific stock and manipulate its stock price. However, it could just be that people with the same training and background might have a similar way of looking at securities and inadvertently target the same stocks without any agreement to do so as a group,&amp;#8221; says Kevin Scanlan, partner in the hedge fund practice at law firm Dechert. &amp;#8220;Julian is such a choir boy; he&amp;#8217;s a stickler for integrity,&amp;#8221; says one investor. But the Tigers&amp;#8217; huge share of the hedge fund universe makes it possible that they could have an impact on the price of a stock position widely held by all, depending on the market capitalization of the company. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s frightening,&amp;#8221; says another investor, one who falls into the camp of Tiger detractors. The reason, he says, is that &amp;#8220;there is a collection of people thinking alike, and what if it doesn&amp;#8217;t work out?&amp;#8221; He adds: &amp;#8220;It might inflate stocks, because they own in aggregate a lot of [the same] stocks, or [push them down] because they are all running for the door at the same time.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s hard to know how big of an impact they do have, however. The five largest cubs, excluding Viking Global Investors, all profited handsomely from their Google positions last year, but they collectively still own less than 1% of the outstanding shares. At a minimum, the crossholdings suggest that investors aren&amp;#8217;t always getting much diversification by investing in more than one Tiger cub or seed. Still, when the crossholdings are moving in the funds&amp;#8217; favor, as they did last year, few investors complain. Google stock was up 50.2% in 2007, while Apple rose 133.5%, and many of the Tigers were up 40% or more. &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t mind overlap in their portfolios,&amp;#8221; says one who knows them well. &amp;#8220;If great managers came to the same conclusion by themselves, great.&amp;#8221; THE LEVEL OF crossholdings, and the common stocks held, differs among the funds, an analysis of the most recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings shows. For example, a large percentage - 38.5% - of Tiger cub Steve Mandel&amp;#8217;s $9 billion Lone Pine Capital&amp;#8217;s U.S. stock holdings was in the eight names held by the top Tigers, as of March 31. Common crossholdings are Apple, Google, Qualcomm, RIM and Baidu.com, credit card companies MasterCard and Visa, and Mexican wireless provider Amrica Mvil (via an ADR). Tiger Veda, the $775 million fund run by Manish Chopra - one of the few who is both a Tiger cub and a seed - holds only three U.S. names out of 60 global positions in common with other Tigers. His U.S. portfolio is only 23.1% in Tiger names Qualcomm, Amrica Mvil and Google. But Google, he says, &amp;#8220;is not a theme; it&amp;#8217;s our only Internet search idea.&amp;#8221; As Laffont points out, &amp;#8220;People focus on 20% of the portfolio being the same but forget that there&amp;#8217;s another 80%.&amp;#8221; Coatue&amp;#8217;s four biggest U.S. long positions at the end of the first quarter, however, were Apple, Google, Qualcomm and RIM, making up 45.5% of the fund&amp;#8217;s U.S. longs. Laffont added to these positions in the first quarter as their share prices fell but trimmed the fund&amp;#8217;s exposure to these stocks when they rebounded from first-quarter lows. It&amp;#8217;s hard to know the precise percentage Tigers own in common, as the SEC filings typically show only long positions in U.S. stocks and don&amp;#8217;t include non-U.S. names or shorts, including the short subprime bet placed by many Tigers in 2007. One question is whether the common holdings are where the bulk of the returns - or losses - come from. Last year, many Tiger cubs invested in the tech stars were up 40% or more, but this year, those same stock picks have bruised their returns. Shares of Google were off 21.6% for the year through June 24, while shares of Apple were down 12.5%. Take Lone Pine, with its heavy percentage of Tiger favorites, including the tech names. Lone Cypress has an annualized return since inception of 25.4% through March, and it gained 46.2% last year. The firm has around $19 billion in total assets, including $10 billion in long-only money. &amp;#8220;The only one that&amp;#8217;s institutional and successful is Lone Pine,&amp;#8221; says an investor. But not this year so far. Lone Cypress lost more than 4% through May, though investors say that is due more to its bets on European stocks than Apple and Google. Even tech-heavy Coatue is up 3.4% through May. By comparison, the Nasdaq Composite is off 14.1%. On the other hand, one Tiger cub who has no exposure to the tech names is one of the better performing cubs this year. Andreas Halvorsen&amp;#8217;s Viking Global Investors gained 7.6% through May even though the fund&amp;#8217;s level of crossholdings is high, at 34.1%. &amp;#8220;Viking played the financials very well, and credit markets, [with] very astute CDS exposure and nimbleness therein as markets and volatility moved tremendously,&amp;#8221; says someone close to the fund. &amp;#8220;They were also helped by their credit card company exposure.&amp;#8221; MasterCard, the firm&amp;#8217;s largest long U.S. equity position at the end of the first quarter, rose 43.6% this year through May. Visa, the firm&amp;#8217;s third-largest holding (behind Qualcomm), went public in March at $44 - the largest U.S. IPO ever. The stock price has almost doubled since then. While Tiger managers may think alike, it&amp;#8217;s clear they hope their differences will give them an edge. &amp;#8220...
