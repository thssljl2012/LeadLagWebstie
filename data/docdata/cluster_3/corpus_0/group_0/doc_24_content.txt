IndyMac, in a securities filing late Monday, said that is is working with U.S. regulators on a plan to shore up the company's safety and soundness. However, other than their statements on raising capital, little information was divulged by the struggling bank.  The U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates IndyMac, didn't release any statements per IndyMac's filing. What remains to be seen is whether IndyMac gets a bailout. There are two scenarios: 1. The Fed decides that IndyMac's failure, along with other struggling financial stocks, could precipitate a panic on Wall Street. Just today, rumors were thrown around that GM might seek bankruptcy protection, resulting in higher oil prices and the Dow reporting at the end of trading that it is down more than 20% from its peak in October, 2007. Adding IndyMac to the list of victims from what is now being considered a "bear market" could be detrimental to the a quicker turnaround for stock market and the economy. If the Fed decides to jump in and save what is now the #11 producer of U.S. home mortgages (since Countrywide was swallowed by Bank of America and Bear Stearns by JP Morgan Chase), they will facilitate a deal between a more stable, sound bank in acquiring IndyMac's assets and risk (losses), however, with a large cushion of government money insuring the deal; lowering the risk for the acquiring bank. 2. The Fed feels like it's necessary to let IndyMac remain accountable for its terrible financial situation, thus, the bank fails and is made an example of as the poster child of irresponsible lending; and that IndyMac's lending practices and overall avarice during the subprime boom will not and should not be rewarded with government assistance.  As each day melts into the other this summer, so does each scenario. Until IndyMac elucidates on what is really going on in its ability to raise capital and what its predicted losses are estimated at, then it is difficult to gauge an end result for the Pasadena-based bank.Originally posted at InjuryBoard by Paul Kiesel
