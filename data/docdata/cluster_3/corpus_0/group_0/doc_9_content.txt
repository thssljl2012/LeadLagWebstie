 If Tuesday had me second-guessing whether I should be sitting in cash, today took away all doubt.Today erased the 152-point jump in the Dow on Tuesday, and took away a bit more for good measure.Iran was shooting off missles, Cisco (CSCO) fell to near its 52-week low on a dismal outlook for next quarter and government-backed mortgage buyer Freddie Mac (FRE) fell nearly 24 percent on concerns that the company may need a capital infusion.All this delivered 2 percent drops in the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500.News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch said today that he expects that it will take at least another year to get through the mess we're in, according to the Associated Press."I'm a bit of a bear," Murdoch said at an annual media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho hosted by investment bank Allen &amp; Co. "I think there's more (bad news) to come and it'll take a year to shake out."Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis echoed that year timeframe to MarketWatch, saying that the U.S. economy should start a gradual recovery in mid-2009, but that it "may feel like a recession" until then.Nope, I feel good doing nothing right now. Hope everyone one else is doing OK, whether they're bailing or hanging tough.Brian.
