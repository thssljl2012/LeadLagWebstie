            Wachovia announced its second quarter results today. As described by this CNN article, Wachovia lost almost $9 billion in the second quarter which was worst than Wall Street's expectations. But analysts said Wachovia is making the necessary changes to contain these losses.In Wachovia's press release I found this presentation (pdf) which included on page 5 some interesting stats regarding their consumer CD balance growth. It mentions the launch of the new CD campaign on June 22nd with the following results:$4.7 billion/week in new CDs vs. approximately $800 million/week in new CDs during 7 weeks prior to launch52% of CDs sold to checking account customers36% sold to new customersAverage rate paid on CD portfolio continued to decline from 3/31/08A chart shows that consumer CD balances have increased by $11.4 billion for the first 3 weeks in July. What's strange about the chart is that it shows the average rate paid on CDs has declined since 3/31/08 from 4.38% to 3.74%. I wonder how this can be when all of their Featured CDs have rates of 3.92% (4% APY) and higher. I suppose many of the old CDs that were paying over 4% are maturing and many people may be letting their old CDs renew into low paying new CDs. Wachovia's regular CD rates are currently under 2%.For the latest information on this Wachovia CD campaign and the Featured CD rates, please refer to this Friday post. CD yields range from 4% APY for a 7-month term to 5.25% APY for a 60-month term. The latest word I received from the banking rep is that these rates are scheduled to remain until August 5th. But as we learned, these scheduled end-dates are often inaccurate.To see all the latest CD rates and promotions including ones from Bank of America and WaMu, please refer to my weekly summary.Labels: banking news, banks, certificates of deposit, Wachovia
