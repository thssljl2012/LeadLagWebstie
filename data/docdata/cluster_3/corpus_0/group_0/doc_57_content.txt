Yesterday, however, crude oil slide below $ 140 a barrel, losing more than 5%,&amp;nbsp; the largest single day loss in the last 17 years. Commentators attribute the loss to investors fleeing energy related stocks and commodities, reasoning that the rather severe US economic downturn would reduce demand for fuel.&amp;nbsp; MarketWatch report   The US economic troubles, particularly in the housing and now the financial sector, are remarkably severe.&amp;nbsp; Last week, AP reported that mortgage foreclosure filings in June increased more than 50% over last year's rate.&amp;nbsp; Economists expect 2.7 million homeowners to receive foreclosure notices in 2008 and more than half are expected to actually lose their homes.&amp;nbsp; MercuryNews/AP report&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; More and more foreclosures are likely due to continued job losses, housing prices that are plummeting in some markets, slow home sales, and increasingly tight mortgage lending restrictions.  The rapidly accelerating foreclosure problem has created a crisis in the financial markets.&amp;nbsp; :the $4 - 8 billion failure of IndyMac on Friday was one of the largest bank failures ever, occurring after a precipitous drop in its stocks.&amp;nbsp; The graph below on the left showing all stock price data for IndyMac and the graph on the right showing data for the last year demonstrate just how precipitous the cliff was for IndyMac:                 &amp;nbsp;  Despite the federal government pledge Sunday to bailout the secondary mortgage giants of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by extending more credit or buying a stake in secondary market firms, the firms' bank financial strength ratings have been slashed and investors continue to flee from their stocks. Forbes/Thomson Financial News   Though the chair of the FDIC assures us that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are well-capitalized, they are reportedly leveraged to the tune of nearly 70-1.&amp;nbsp;     And the continuing decline in their stock prices as of yesterday (reflected in the 1 year charts below -- click on the charts for larger pop-up images)  as of yesterday continues today.&amp;nbsp;               Emergency rules issued today&amp;nbsp; restricted short sales of the two firms, but did not stem investor flight today as Freddie Mac lost $1.85, falling&amp;nbsp; 26% tdoay from $7.11to $5.26 and Fannie Mae lost $ 2.66, falling&amp;nbsp; 27% from $9.73 to $7.07.
