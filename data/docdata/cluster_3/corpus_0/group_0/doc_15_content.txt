Finsec National Organiser Bella Pardoe said that the case was put very strongly of the need for a 5% pay increase. Finsec reps presented a paper to the bank setting out the key economic and social arguments for a 5% increase. Members can view a copy of the paper here on the Finsec website: http://www.finsec.org.nz/ANZNational/ANZ%20National%20Negotiations%2024%20July%202008.pdf.  Pardoe said that the next step was a meeting on Monday with ANZ National CEO Graham Hodges, to try and convince him personally of the importance of ANZ National staff achieving a pay increase in real terms at a time in which staff are working harder and the bank has never been more profitable.
