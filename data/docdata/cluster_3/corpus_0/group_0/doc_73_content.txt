 ...I see that Jesse Jackson generously offered to prevent Obama from ever getting testicular cancer, and that this has had the effect of making Obama more popular. How sweet and refreshing.Mainly, though, I want to post this from Dizard in the FT, who as usual slices through the BS to the heart of the matter in the current investment climate:To hear them talk, the central bankers and regulators believe this is a world where we can continue to have, at the same time, accelerating asset write-downs, stricter capital ratios, and flatter yield and credit curves. That is, without having the real economies shut down from lack of liquidity.The only way the banks can reconstruct their balance sheets, or at least their cash flow statements, is from years of steep yield curves caused by artificially low policy rates...The level of gloom on housing finance has now got to the point where banks are competing to come up with yet more dire worst case scenarios for valuing mortgage paper. Interestingly, though, even those cases appear to show some value in certain housing-backed paper.For example, Bank of Americas fixed income group, using a stress case analysis based on a further 27 per cent decline in house prices over the next two years, found some value in non-US government agency-backed paper.Given the rate of dumping thats already occurred, and consequent low prices, the bank says that AA rated bonds backed by seasoned collateral offer double digit returns with no principal write-downs . . . while AA bonds backed by 2006/2007 alt-A collateral take massive write-downs, their adjusted yields are in excess of 40 per cent even in our most conservative (house price decline) scenario."Of course, even with those calculations you cant give the things away. Think about it.At times like this, I really do wish I were an institutional-sized investor who could take advantage of stuff like this.
