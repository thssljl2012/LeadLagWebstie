     Go read this short post by Brick Oven Bill, then mosey on back here and I'll put it all together for you.OK, consider this: large national banks in the developed nations are not radical investors. National Australian Bank invested it's reserves in US mortgage paper, which, at the time they made the investment, was considered a good investment, because the paper was sold in packages, and you didn't get all sub-prime loans, you got some good ones (like mine, for instance) in the mix also. If NAB is saying that they will have to write off 55% of that investment, that tells us something, ET fans: it isn't just the sub-prime market which is failing to perform, it's the WHOLE MORTGAGE MARKET.The thirty-percent figure bandied about as the stop-loss point in the real estate market is probably highly underestimated. It has to be closer to the 55% figure quoted by the article.A thirty-percent loss, if properly managed, will NOT be the end of the financial world as we know it, it will just cull out all the marginal operators, but the real strength, the big banks, will pull through with astute management and rebuild themselves in a few years.A fifty-percent loss is a horse of another color. With around 8 trillion or so in residential mortgages out there, fifty percent of that figure is 4 trillion (a year's GDP), and bear in mind that we haven't even begun to look into the overvalued BUSINESS real estate mortgages. Why should inflated residential real estate take all the heat and have to correct down to actual value, while the hyper-inflated business holdings get to hold on to all their inflated value?That's not going to happen, and a likely major correction in the commercial real estate market would finish off the economy, as in TEOT(financial)WAWKI.Got any more of that happy-smoke to blow up our hoo-hoos, Mr. Bernanke? Better save some of it for yourself, though, your investments are headed over the same cliff as mine.
