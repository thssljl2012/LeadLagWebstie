Priced at $10 and $13.40 a share, respectively, it's getting to the point where you can possibly get Wachovia or Lehman (and others, for that matter) for a song.&amp;nbsp; Question:&amp;nbsp; Who's got deep enough pockets?  Among banks and investment banks, 4 names come to mind:&amp;nbsp; (1) JPMorgan's market cap is around $110B;&amp;nbsp; (2) Spain's Santander's market cap is $110.8B;&amp;nbsp; (3) HSBC's market cap is around $176B;&amp;nbsp; and (4) Bank of America's market cap stands at $93B.&amp;nbsp; Of course, private equity firms are flush with cash and have been clamoring for a piece of the action - and the Fed and Treasury seem to be somewhat more receptive to these institutions.&amp;nbsp; Sovereign wealth funds are always a possibility, but while they're long on the funds, they're short the political clout;&amp;nbsp; so, basically, we can can count them out.&amp;nbsp; Another, perhaps more likely alternative, would be stock-for-stock mergers among financial institutions - as in coupling a commercial bank with an investment bank.&amp;nbsp;   Where do we go from here?&amp;nbsp; Someone just needs to pen some lyrics to the melodies we already know all too well.&amp;nbsp; [AOL Finance, 7/14]
