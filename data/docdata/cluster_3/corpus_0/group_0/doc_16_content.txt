             ANZ National intends to sell and lease back 16 of its National bank branches across New Zealand . It is to enable the bank to unlock capital to reinvest for growth. The bank says the properties are available with secure long term lease - six on the North Island and 10 in the South Island. Not an unusual initiative, as it owns only 56 of its 314 branches. Auctions will be held in September.Copyright 2002 - 2008. TelstraClear Ltd
