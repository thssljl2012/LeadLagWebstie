Welcome to the United Socialist States of America. It has been announced that AIG has been nationalized this evening, or at least 80%. First we had Bear Sterns forced to sell to J.P. Morgan, then Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were nationalized. Then Merrill Lynch was forced to sell to Bank of America and now this. The feds don't seem to like the price of gasoline at the pump so they mind as well nationalize the oil companies too. Food prices are kind of high too, maybe we should revert back to collective farming.So now we are trusting the federal government to oversee operations in the housing and insurance markets. With their ownership in these sectors, infusing their management ideals is not far away. I'm not looking forward to the government influencing these sectors since they can't even manage a restaurant.How is risk going to managed in the future if there is no threat of failure? Why do the U.S. citizens who conservatively managed their finances have to now be part owners in failing mortgage and insurance businesses? Seriously, where does it end? Does the state really think this will prevent the malinvestments from eventually being destroyed? Why do we keep bailing out Bill Gross(FNM too)?befuddledmonkey
