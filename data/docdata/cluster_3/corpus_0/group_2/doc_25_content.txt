Just wondering how everyone feels about the recent issues in the financial sector (since last week). &amp;nbsp;To summarize, Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America due to $51.8 billion in losses and further obligation to buy back mortgage-backed securities.&amp;nbsp; Compounding to that is Lehman Brothers' filing of bankruptcy protection today.&amp;nbsp; With a reported bank debt of $613 billion, and bond debt of $155 billion, it is the largest bankruptcy in US history.&amp;nbsp; Of greater concern is AIG's request for financial assistance.&amp;nbsp; Being the largest insurance company in the world, and one of the largest corporations in the world, a failing AIG can potentially be the deathblow for the global economy.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, we have yet to hear from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, two other major investment firms (major may be an understatement). &amp;nbsp;The worst case scenario is that AIG, GS, and MS all face much greater financial issues than predicted, and LEH fails to resolve their debt issues, which may potentially lead to a global depression similar to the Great Depression.&amp;nbsp; In the best case scenario, AIG rebounds, GS and MS are faring better than expected, and someone either picks up LEH or they manage to sort through their debts, in which case we'll simply continue this correction and be fine, relatively speaking. &amp;nbsp;Say something, I want to know what everyone thinks, and if anyone even cares.
