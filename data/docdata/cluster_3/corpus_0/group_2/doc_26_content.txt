As darkness fails on Wall Street, two storied firms may have just seen their last day as independent companies.  Lehman Brothers, which seemed to be the only firm at risk this weekend, failed to reach a deal with Bank of America or Barclays, and looks to be headed for bankruptcy.  Merrill Lynch, in the face of a Lehman liquidation, has decided to fall into the embrace of BofA, and there are rumors that it will accept at $29 a share bid, valuing the company at $40 billionI don't think anyone thought that these two events would be the conclusion for this weekend.  Although nothing is yet set in stone, the fact that two major Wall Street firms may be no more tomorrow will certainly change the face of finance.  Dow futures are now down well over 200 points, and I plan to be in watch mode, as markets may be poised for a bloodbath tomorrowBottom Line:  With Lehman and Merrill now gone, the era of independent brokerage may be over.  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are the only two that now remain*As an FYI CNBC has gone live
