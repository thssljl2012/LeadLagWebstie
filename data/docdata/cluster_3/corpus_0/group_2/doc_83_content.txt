                So ... Lehman Brothers is on the verge of declaring bankruptcy, Merrill is apparently being sold at a deep discount to Bank Of America, and AIG is seeking a bridge loan from the Fed (i.e., the taxpayers) to the tune of $40 billion.  Yuck.I don't know whether the Fed will help AIG, but it seems that it won't be stepping in to rescue Lehman, although it worked feverishly -- and unsuccessfully -- to organize a Long-Term Capital Management-style "bail-in" by the rest of Wall Street's big players.  The Fed shouldn't break its arm patting itself on the back for avoiding the moral hazard of a bailout of Lehman, however.  Because of the specific facts of its situation, Lehman's insolvency won't ripple across the financial sector like Bear Stearns' collapse would have, and I bet there are other players out there too big to fail who could end up on the dole as well.Despite these problems, two massive bailouts in one year, and the new availability of credit from the Fed to unregulated investment banks, there hasn't yet been new regulation to assure that we don't have such great privatization of profit and socialization of loss.  Taxpayer bailouts are bad, but so is the worsening of the credit crunch that's sure to follow the Lehman debacle.  The public has an interest in keeping things like this from happening, and the same financial industry now clamoring for government help to do something are the same who lobby the hardest against regulation in the first place.Labels: finance
