     It use to be that if that if the stocks in your financial portfolio went bust, you stepped onto the ledge of a bulding and jumped.&amp;nbsp; After the streetcleaner swept the mess up the next morning, that was the end to it.&amp;nbsp; Maybe a passerby would have stolen your shoes in the interim but not much more.&amp;nbsp; With all these gov't bailouts of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and Bear Sterns and AIG, the US Treasury has morphed itself into the equivalent of Lloyd's of London even though their clients never paid for the insurance, nor in AIG's case, an insurance company itself never had the foresight to seek insurance from another outfit.  Don't ask me what it is, but there's something inherently wrong with a solution to rescue these financial giants that's parlayed on a notion that a company is so huge that its collapse would spell doomsday for all the other sectors of the US economy.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps, it would.&amp;nbsp; However these losers were making obsene profits just a few years ago and laughing at you and me all the way to the bank and reservations at french restaurants.&amp;nbsp; Would the gov't bailout the Big Oil if the oil industry went insolvent?&amp;nbsp; Of course they would.&amp;nbsp;
