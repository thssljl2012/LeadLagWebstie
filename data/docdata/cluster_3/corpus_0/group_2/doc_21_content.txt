You're about to become the proud owner of a global insurance company.The Federal Reserve has tentatively agreed to provide $85 billion in emergency lending to insurance giant AIG in hope of preventing a bankruptcy that could send tremors through the U.S. and global financial markets, according to two sources familiar with the plan.In exchange, the Fed would get rights to 79.9 percent of AIG's stock, a source said. One source said the government would replace the company's management while the other source said the government gained the right to replace the chief executive and board and appeared likely to do so. Repeat after me: "Privatize the profit, socialize the risk."
