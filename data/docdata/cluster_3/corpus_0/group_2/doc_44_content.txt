Sept. 19 (Bloomberg) &amp;#8212; The market storm that brought down Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., American International Group Inc. and other pillars of U.S. finance may have also blown holes in the portfolios of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senator John Kerry and more than 50 other members of Congress. Pelosi, in her most recent financial disclosure form, reported that her husband owned between $250,000 and $500,000 of stock in AIG, which ceded majority control to the U.S. government this week in exchange for $85 billion of loans.

AIG has fallen 85 percent this week to close yesterday at $2.69. The lawmakers&amp;#8217; aides didn&amp;#8217;t respond to calls seeking comment. Altogether, 56 senators and representatives had stakes in AIG, Lehman, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Bear Stearns Cos. or IndyMac Bancorp Inc. &amp;#8212; some of the biggest casualties of the market bloodbath &amp;#8212; according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The most recent annual disclosure filings list investments as of Dec. 31, 2007, and reveal the size of holdings only within a range of values. Lawmakers may have sold shares since then. &amp;#8220;Lawmakers, like everyone else in America who has any kind of retirement portfolio or stock holdings, are going to be suffering,&amp;#8221; said Gary Kalman, a lobbyist for the Boston-based U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a consumer-advocacy organization. &amp;#8220;This is a serious issue. We need to have a serious response.&amp;#8221;  U.S. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., Sept. 16, 2008.(AP Photo/Elise Amendola) Market Plunges The Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;#8217;s 500 Index plunged 7.6 percent during the first three days of this week on news that Lehman and Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. &amp;#8212; which survived two world wars and the Great Depression &amp;#8212; were finished as independent investment banks. Lehman filed history&amp;#8217;s biggest bankruptcy case on Sept. 15 and Merrill sold itself to Bank of America Corp. Even after rallying yesterday, the S&amp;amp;P 500 is down almost 25 percent from its October 2007 peak. Lehman shares, which traded for as much as $67.73 last November, closed yesterday at 5 cents. Merrill&amp;#8217;s shareholders are in better shape. To avoid Lehman&amp;#8217;s fate, Merrill agreed to be acquired in a stock-swap worth $26.28 per share at yesterday&amp;#8217;s closing prices. In better days, Merrill soared to as much as $98.68 in January 2007. Bear Stearns was the first Wall Street titan to fall as home-loan defaults battered the market for mortgage-backed securities and started a chain reaction that devastated credit markets. JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. bought Bear Stearns in March. Read the rest: http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;sid=aSEtGBXG0C0s&amp;amp;refer=worldwide
