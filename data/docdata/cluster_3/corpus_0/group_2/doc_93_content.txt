This is just in. I'm sure all US Finance majors would be tuning into the news now.Lehman Brothers just declared bankruptcy today. They crashed from a steady price of $ 22 per stock in June to $0.21 today.Merrill Lynch was also bought by The Bank of America to save themselves from being dragged down like the Lehman Bros.Over 30000 qualified employees are now unemployed. Who's next?AIG?  Washington Mutual(WaMu)?The DowJones fell by 504.48 today. The government is placing their focus on this turmoil.The 'Wall Street meltdown' now remains as the major concern for all Americans. It was said to be the worst crisis since the Depression.I just applied my internship yesterday.With Bear Sterns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Bros. gone, it would be a huge hit for us students. Many are considering switching their majors.Tomorrow's opening bell would indeed be an intense story to catch.
