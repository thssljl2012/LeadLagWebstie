I was gonna blog about the delicious ironing that is McCain&amp;#8217;s opinions on how to handle health care, courtesy of the American Academy of Actuaries: Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation. I know, hilarious. He&amp;#8217;s going on all &amp;#8220;those Wall Street people need a reprimand!&amp;#8221; now because there&amp;#8217;s nothing else to say. But before shit hit the fan, he was saying we should be having health care follow the brilliant lead of Wall Street. A path for which he feels partially responsible for (I honestly doubt he was using the royal &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8221;). Mavericky! But I think Barack Obama explains it with the right amount of righteous snark and derision such a proposal merits. So here he is.
