               If John McCains economy plans arent enough to scare you, check this out:                         Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous                         nationwide competition, as we have done over the last                         decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative                         products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based                         regulation.Yep, what deregulation did to our economy, John wants to do to health care. Doesnt that sound like fun?In the days to come and in the debate, it will be interesting to see if he has learned anything from the past few days or whether he will be willing to gamble with our lives the same way he has gambled with our financial futures for the last 30 years.Labels: deregulation, health care, healthcare, John McCain
