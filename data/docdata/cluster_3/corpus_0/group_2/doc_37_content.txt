                The next step in the drift towards Republican Party socialism has occurred, as the U.S. government takes an 80% stake in AIG, the world's largest insurance company, via warrants.  This is probably the right decision to make, given the importance of the bond insurance portfolio of AIG and the widespread impact a bankruptcy would have on the global economic structure.  Nevertheless, it is weird seeing the Republican Party behaving like the Communist Party.
