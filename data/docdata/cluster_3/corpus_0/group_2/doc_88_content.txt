Is anyone else particularly alarmed by the financial news lately?  Clip from today:"Insurer American International Group (AIG.N) struggled for survival a day after a financial tsunami overtook investment bank Lehman and forced the sale of rival Merrill Lynch in the biggest financial industry shake-up since the Great Depression.AIG's struggles followed the failure of frantic attempts to find a rescuer for investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc (LEH.N), and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co's (MER.N) agreement to be taken over by Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).The U.S. Federal Reserve has hired investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to review options for AIG, which has lost some 90 percent of its value so far this year, a person familiar with the situation said on Monday."AIG begged for a government loan.  Fanny May and Freddie Mack were part of an almost unprecedented government take over.  Merrill Lynch is suddenly sold...AIG's stock has apparently gone from $70 a share to ....$15.  (that would mean if you held $1million in AIG stock is is now worth about 210,000.)  This, ladies and gentleman, is not good.  Not good at all.  Makes a girl want to take her retirement funds out of the mutual funds and shove them in a nice safe (well, comparatively) CD.  Only CD interest rates have plummeted this summer, so when I was getting 4% I'm now getting something like 2.3%  (Both of which is, of course, less then the interest rate on my credit card...OF COURSE).I'm just wondering if anyone else has noticed the frightening unraveling of large financial institutions...
