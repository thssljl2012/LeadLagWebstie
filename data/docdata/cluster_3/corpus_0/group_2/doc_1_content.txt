Yesterday the massive Washington Mutual Inc. collapsed due to its bad bets on the mortgage market.Again I strongly recommend you go to our dvd page and get the tv interview between myself and prophecy teacher Tony Pearce recorded earlier this year on the coming money crash and the last days. Also my interview with prophecy expert Alan Franklin on the EU covers this as well. Be informed; be warned.Go to: http://bob-mitchell-dvd.blogspot.com/WASHINGTON MUTUAL COLLAPSEAs the debate over a $700 billion bank bailout rages on in Washington, one of the nation's largest banks - Washington Mutual Inc. - has collapsed under the weight of its enormous bad bets on the mortgage market.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seized WaMu on Thursday, and then sold the thrift's banking assets to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. for $1.9 billion. Seattle-based WaMu, which was founded in 1889, is the largest bank to fail by far in the country's history.Its $307 billion in assets eclipse the $40 billion of Continental Illinois National Bank, which failed in 1984, and the $32 billion of IndyMac, which the government seized in July. One positive is that the sale of WaMu's assets to JPMorgan Chase prevents the thrift's collapse from depleting the FDIC's insurance fund. But that detail is likely to give only marginal solace to Americans facing tighter lending and watching their stock portfolios plunge in the wake of the nation's most momentous financial crisis since the Great Depression.Because of WaMu's souring mortgages and other risky debt, JPMorgan plans to write down WaMu's loan portfolio by about $31 billion - a figure that could change if the government goes through with its bailout plan and JPMorgan decides to take advantage of it."We're in favor of what the government is doing, but we're not relying on what the government is doing. We would've done it anyway," JPMorgan's Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a conference call Thursday night, referring to the acquisition. Dimon said he does not know if JPMorgan will take advantage of the bailout. WaMu is JPMorgan Chase's second acquisition this year of a major financial institution hobbled by losing bets on mortgages.In March, JPMorgan bought the investment bank Bear Stearns Cos. for about $1.4 billion, plus another $900 million in stock ahead of the deal to secure it. JPMorgan Chase is now the second-largest bank in the United States after Bank of America Corp., which recently bought Merrill Lynch in a flurry of events that included Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. going bankrupt and American International Group Inc., the world's largest insurer, getting taken over by the government.
