In an exclusive interview with CNBC.com, Wilbur Ross, chairman and CEO of WL Ross &amp;amp; Co., says he sees possibly as many as a thousand bank closures in the coming months. And this will create opportunities for investors. &amp;#8220;I do think a lot of the regional ones will (close), just as they did in the last savings and loan crisis in the 1990s,&amp;#8221; Ross said. Ross says he will be looking to pick up smaller distressed institutions. &amp;#8220;There will be opportunities, but we will need federal assistance in them, because what we&amp;#8217;re mainly looking for is stable sources of deposits, not so much the loan portfolio.&amp;#8221; Ross feels that there will be too many people willing to provide capital to the large financials, which makes them less of a bargain than smaller banks. When asked about his views on Bank of America&amp;#8217;s purchase of Merrill Lynch Ross said that he didn&amp;#8217;t think that Merrill was in that dire a position. &amp;#8220;I think people in general felt better about Merrill&amp;#8217;s situation than about Lehman. I think ever since John Thain came in, he&amp;#8217;s done a wonderful job trying to fix what was a very difficult situation,&amp;#8221; Ross said. He also noted that this was really now the second successful turnaround for Thain. &amp;#8220;He (Thain)saved Merrill, went into BoFA &amp;#8230; Temasek, for example, went into something like a $5 a share profit out of this. So it&amp;#8217;s not a tragic ending.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;It will be very interesting to see where Thain ends up in the Bank of America hierarchy,&amp;#8221; Ross added. http://www.cnbc.com/id/26710362
