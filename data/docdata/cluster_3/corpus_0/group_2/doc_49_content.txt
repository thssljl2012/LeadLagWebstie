My e-mail inbox lit up on Sunday with breaking news alerts about the craziness on Wall Street. First, the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America. Then Lehman Brothers declaring bankruptcy. Today, the news broadcasts can&amp;#8217;t get enough of it and it&amp;#8217;ll be a front-page story in the Post-Dispatch for two days running. To be sure, it&amp;#8217;s huge news, stemming from the meltdown of the capital markets as a result of investments in mortgage-backed securites. A few paragraphs from the story: The swift developments that took place Sunday are the biggest yet in the 14-month-old credit crisis that stems from now toxic subprime mortgage debt. For the first part of Monday&amp;#8217;s trading, the market was falling, but in a largely orderly fashion as investors seemed to draw some relief from the resolution of Lehman&amp;#8217;s problems. As the session wore on, and there was no word about AIG, the market suffered another bout of fear that the credit crisis will continue to devastate the financial sector. Selling accelerated in the final hour and then took on more momentum as stock indexes broke through lows set in July - an ominous sign for some traders.

This is what also struck me as interesting: In spite of a drop in the Dow&amp;#8217;s drop of 504 points (4.42 percent), it only brought the index back to its levels of mid-July. So, is the Dow&amp;#8217;s drop a big deal? Does it signal a reason to worry, or will this too pass? If so, how soon?
