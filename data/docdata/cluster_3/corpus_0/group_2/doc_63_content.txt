LIKE A LOT of people I've been following the financial troubles on Wall St. over the past few days (months, really). And like a lot of people I've been wondering how this will affect my own investments. Luckily, I took a lot of economics and finance classes in college so I know the iimportance of diversification. I downloaded our portolio to reassure Kerri and to show her that I didn't put all our eggs in one basket. I've listed our portfolio below in case some of you want some investing tips:Stock (% of Portfolio)Bear Stearns (15%)Lehman Bros. (18%)American Insurance Group (AIG) (16%)Merrill Lynch (17%)Halifax Bank of Scotland (21%)Thigh Master, Inc. (17%)That's why diversification is so important. We should be fine.CJS
