Maybe I should say 'back a quarter', or a half, or three-fourths.  I never thought I'd find myself gripped by CNBC and stock market news while brushing my teeth, but that's a perk of living on the west coast I guess.  Heh.  So now that Lehman Brothers has officially filed for bankruptcy, Merril Lynch has been bought out by Bank of America, and AIG is looking for a financial bailout, can we officially say the Dub's irresponsible economic policies which did nothing but foster a climate where predatory lending flourished are to blame?  You can bet the administration is back-peddling and saying they're innocent, but how many more industries and sectors need to be affected before someone will walk out of the White House and say, 'you know what, folks, yes, we fucked it up.'  Accountability?  What the heck is that?  Maybe I should give the Dub a little credit for acknowledging Americans are in "pain."  O_o  And, of course, McCain and Obama took rhetorical flight.  While I watched the Dow and other markets plummet, the one seemingly bright star was that the price of oil dropped $6 today.  Woo.  Let me know when the stock market crashes.  I'm waiting for that, you can bet on it.So here's an observation, and I say observation because I'm no economist, but is it noteworthy that 'Reaganomics,' that bastion of Republican economic policy, culminated in the stock market crash of 1987?  Or that Geo. H.W. Bush left office with the economy in a recession?  And now we have this colossal, global mess.  Maybe it's a coincidence that all three are Republicans.  What do I know.
