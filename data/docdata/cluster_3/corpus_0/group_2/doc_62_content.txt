WaMu Falls in German Trading After S&amp;P Slashes Rating to JunkBy Edward Evans and Ari LevySept. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Washington Mutual Inc., the biggest U.S. savings and loan, fell 6 percent in German trading after Standard &amp; Poor's cut its credit rating to junk.S&amp;P cited the deteriorating U.S. housing market and for its decision after the market close yesterday to slash its rating on Seattle-based WaMu to BB- from BBB-, leaving it three levels below investment grade. The stock fell to $1.88 by 10:30 a.m. in Frankfurt today, down from Monday's $2 close in New York.``Increasing market turmoil and the related impact from managing its concentrated mortgage franchise in this troubled housing and credit cycle led to the downgrade,'' S&amp;P said in a statement yesterday. Wamu's ``weak equity pricing in the markets is also a concern, and it increasingly appears that market conditions could overtake credit fundamentals and leave the company with greatly diminished financial flexibility.''Wamu's $143 billion of deposits may still buy Chief Executive Officer Alan Fishman time to prove wrong speculators who say the bank could follow Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. into bankruptcy. WaMu, which has reported $6.3 billion of losses in the last three quarters on mortgage writedowns, said on Sept. 11 it expects a third-quarter loan loss provision of $4.5 billion.WaMu shares slid 27 percent in New York yesterday after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. agreed to sell itself to Bank of America Corp. for $50 billion. American International Group Inc., the largest U.S. insurer by assets, also fell 61 percent to $4.76. AIG is seeking a $75 billion loan through Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. after the Federal Reserve balked at providing funding, according to people familiar with the situation.
