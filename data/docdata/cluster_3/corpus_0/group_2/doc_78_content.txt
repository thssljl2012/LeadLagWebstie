Yep... Washington Mutual... otherwise known as WAMU... is on the auction block.&amp;nbsp; Apparently... it's problems have seriously grown... having escalated to the point that the largest savings and loan in the United States can't solve them on their own... and that's after a 7 billion infusion back in April.When you consider the failures of 11 banks, the insolvency of Bear Stearns, the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the bailout of AIG and the rescue of Merrill Lynch by Bank Of America... you have to wonder what's next.&amp;nbsp; Frankly.. I'm a bit afraid of the immediate future and what it may mean for most Americans.&amp;nbsp; The money supply is drying up.&amp;nbsp; The available cash is going into these firms to bail them out of their problems.The whole situation is killing the average American, their family, and most small businesses.It's just crazy out there.
