For teh past few days, Senator McSame has consistently blamed the on-going banking crisis on Senator Obama and the Democratic leadership. It's there fore a little odd, when you read his campaign's position on health care: &amp;quot;Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.&amp;quot;Until the past few days Senator McSame was claiming credit for the deregulation of the bank industry for himself. Now that the deregulation he waanted credit for has failed disastrously, he credits Senator Obama with the redegulation. Yep, he is exactly the same as George W.And I wonder if his running-mate who joins Senator McSame in denouncing earmarks will demonstrate that she actually means what she says, especially since we as a nation have just assumed a half trillion dollars in debt, and give back all of the earmarks that Alaska has received since she became its Governor. I realize that means that she won't be able to give Alaskans the revenue check they get from the State while most of the rest of us are paying taxes to fund&amp;nbsp;our government and infrastructure, but at least it would demonstrate that she actually is honest about something.
