Forty-eighth in a series.This is from John McCain himself, via Paul Krugman's blog: OK, a correspondent directs me to John McCains article, Better Health Care at Lower Cost for Every American, in the Sept./Oct. issue of Contingencies, the magazine of the American Academy of Actuaries. You might want to be seated before reading this.Heres what McCain has to say about the wonders of market-based health reform:"Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation."That's this month! We need to "open up" health care the way we have "over the last decade in banking". Has he been paying any attention at all?  Fresh from The Greenbelt
