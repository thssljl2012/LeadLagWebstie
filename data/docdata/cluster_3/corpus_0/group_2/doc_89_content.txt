This morning as the markets head into their downward spiral. We find that the government stepped in to take action. Finally! This is a wise intervention. If AIG fell, that would just be bad. The media is pitching this as a bail out. I was nearly certain that the gov would just let the giant fall, to bolster McCain's claims as a Maverick, he and Palin, have said on the stump and in that one interview, that they don't support government intervention.  The tax payer would be paying for it one way or another, if it wasn't through a direct loan, then the global markets would be in even more danger, that would cause less jobs, less opportunity, less tax revenue, so that figure would be even higher. This mess was caused by de-regulation and regulation will save it. We could have stopped this mess years ago, when the first signs were on the wall. That didn't happen, now we're paying for it. When the banks get to this point, it's always to late and all the Fed can do is damage control.   This post comes late, only because I was hanging out with the amazing Michael Musto until two am, ogling cute boys at Beige. I'll write a post about it later.Suze Orman: Well, in this particular case, I have to tell you they should. Bear Stearns, very different. Lehman, very different. AIG is an international giant that just doesn't have ramifications here in the United States. It is worldwide. They're like in 130 countries. They have 100,000 employees. Everybody has an AIG insurance policy. So in this particular case, my opinion, thank God, they bailed out AIG.[Link via CNN]   [LInk via CNN: Customers crowd AIG subsidiary in Singapore]
