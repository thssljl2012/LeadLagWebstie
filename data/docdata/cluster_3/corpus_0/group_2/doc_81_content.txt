      The Obama campaign wants to get you to believe that Senator McCain is out of touch.  You be the judge. The news over the weekend was grim.  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. moved to file for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co.&amp;#8217;s was involved in a forced sale to Bank of America Corp.  In addition, American International Group Inc., the world&amp;#8217;s largest insurance company, is asking the Federal Reserve for emergency funding. John McCain, on the trail in Florida today &amp;#8212; yes, today &amp;#8212; tells us the fundamentals of our economy are &amp;#8220;still&amp;#8221; strong&amp;#8230; Here&amp;#8217;s the full quote: &amp;#8220;You know that there&amp;#8217;s been tremendous turmoil in our financial markets and Wall St. And it is &amp;#8212; people are frightened by these events. Our economy, I think still &amp;#8212; the fundamentals of our economy are strong. But these are very, very difficult times.&amp;#8221; McCain did refer to the big Wall Street events of here, so it isn&amp;#8217;t like this was an unintentional gaffe; this is what he wanted to say. Arguably, of course, that could make this worse. Not cutting this line out on this morning, of all mornings, is a serious mistake.
