I do not usually touch on political stuff but I cannot help but notice the stark difference in the kinds of news from Singapore and other parts of South East Asia, especially in the wake of the latest happenings related to the US mortgage crisis. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the buying over of Merrill Lynch by the Bank of America, the headline news in Singapore almost immediately turned to those concerned with financial institutions of the country, including foreign institutions having operations here. And despite the grim news from the US, it seems that Temasek Holdings could make a potential profit of over 1 billion bucks from the take over of Merrill Lynch.Then I read news from Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. A brief summary would be this - our friendly neighbour up north is embroiled in a dramatic power struggle, Thailand is facing a political chaos that is wrecking havoc on its tourism industry and a suspected bomb goes off in an international airport in Indonesia. What stunned me is that while most other countries are reeling from the fallout from the US and scrambling to salvage, assuage, calm (add more descriptives here) their markets and financial institutions, some are still trying to solve their internal problems, so much so that they seem unaffected by the happenings of global economy. When I say unaffected I don't mean these countries are immune to the effects of the crisis, but rather, there seems to be no news as to how these countries are going to manage their financial institutions.I think it's times like these that we get reminded of the benefits of a stable and economically (as opposed to socially, where things are obviously left much to be desired. But that's another story) effective government. It is precisely because of the almost authoritarian form of governing in Singapore that we do not see the unfortunate incidences I mentioned above. I think it is also times like these that elucidates what and why Singaporeans are willing to give up certain liberties in exchange for.
