The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Fortune all lead with Lehman Brothers' plight this morning. "Lehman races to find a buyer" screams the WSJ headline after a disastrous day during which the once high-flying investment bank's "self-made survival strategy - ranging from spinning off commercial real-estate to selling a stake in Lehman's lucrative investment-management division - failed to halt a slide in Lehman's stock price." By the end of yesterday Lehman's shares had slid 41% as investors voted with their feet. Lehman's best hope now is an outside buyer with Bank of America and Barclays interested but only if the U.S. government offers assurances to help shield them from further losses.

It all seemed so different just one year ago. Back then CEO Dick Fuld (who recently received a $40 million compensation package) said, "Do we have some stuff on the books that would be tough to get rid of? Yes. Is it going to kill us? Of course not." Those words could yet come back to haunt him.Other banks are scrambling to reassure investors, none more so than Washington Mutual which, coming off the back of its own 40%+ share drop this week, issued a statement assuring all and sundry that it "continues to be confident that it has sufficient liquidity and capital to support its operations while it returns to profitability," CNN Money reports. WaMu says it has $50 billion in liquidity but that didn't stop both Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service from downgrading their assessments of the company.[more ...]
