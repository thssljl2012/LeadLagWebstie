[UPDATE 9/17: Turns out Biden and Obama are just as confused on the AIG bailout as McCain is. I've added in their conflicting statements below.] 1/ John McCain, speaking yesterday to NBC&amp;#8217;s Matt Lauer, as reported by ABC&amp;#8217;s Ron Claiborne: &amp;#8220;No, I do not believe that the American taxpayer should be on the hook for AIG and I&amp;#8217;m glad that the Secretary Paulson has apparently taken the same line.&amp;#8221; NBC&amp;#8217;s Matt Lauer pressed McCain: &amp;#8220;So, if we get to the point, in the middle of the week when AIG might have to file for bankruptcy, they&amp;#8217;re on their own?&amp;#8221; McCain replied, &amp;#8220;Well, they&amp;#8217;re on their own. We cannot have the taxpayers bail out AIG or anybody else, this is something that we&amp;#8217;re going to have to work through.&amp;#8221;   1a/ And Joe Biden, speaking yesterday to NBC&amp;#8217;s Meredith Viera: No, I don&amp;#8217;t think [AIG] should be bailed out by the federal government.  I&amp;#8217;ll tell you what we should do.  We should try to correct the problems that caused this. 2/ John McCain, speaking today to ABC&amp;#8217;s Robin Roberts: I didn&amp;#8217;t want to do that. And I don&amp;#8217;t think anybody I know wanted to do that. But there are literally millions of people whose retirement, whose investment, whose insurance were at risk here. 2a/ And Barack Obama, in a statement today: The fact that we have reached a point where the Federal Reserve felt it had to take this unprecedented step with the American Insurance Group is the final verdict on the failed economic philosophy of the last eight years&amp;#8230;. While we do not know all the details of this arrangement, the Fed must ensure that the plan protects the families that count on insurance.  It should bolster our economy&amp;#8217;s ability to create good-paying jobs and help working Americans pay their bills and save their money.  It must not bail out the shareholders or management of AIG. Politico&amp;#8217;s Jonathan Martin quotes the following statement from the McCain campaign this morning that attempts to square the two positions: The focus of any such action should be to protect the millions of Americans who hold insurance policies, retirement plans and other accounts with AIG. We must not bailout the management and speculators who created this mess. They had months of warnings following the Bear Stearns debacle, and they failed to act. Don&amp;#8217;t be deceived by this. As anybody who&amp;#8217;s been paying attention to the situation will know, insurance policies and retirement plans have nothing to do with the bailout. AIG&amp;#8217;s insurance and retirement plans are run through AIG subsidiaries, which everyone agrees are well capitalized and which, at least in the case of the insurance operations, are governed by strict regulations that severely limit the risk to people like you and me. Nothing I&amp;#8217;ve read in the last couple of days suggests that these were ever in danger, even if AIG went into bankruptcy. Rather, the reason for the Fed bailout is, quite simply, the massive counterparty risk that an AIG failure would cause. As newspaper graphic designers across the globe are struggling to explain to their readers today, AIG is a huge player in the market for credit default swaps, which means that they effectively sell insurance to corporate bondholders against the possibility that the companies who issued the bonds will default. In other words, CDS help big financial players limit the risk of their fixed-income (i.e. bond) investments.  CDS are not in and of themselves evil or duplicitous instruments; in fact they help shift risk to the people and companies who want to take it on and away from people who do not. But the major problem with CDS is that the market for them is completely opaque and unregulated, thanks in large part to the efforts of one of John McCain&amp;#8217;s chief economic advisors, Phil Gramm. (A more minor problem&amp;#8211;which reared its head earlier this year&amp;#8211;is that CDS contracts don&amp;#8217;t require initial ownership of the underlying bonds, thus the instruments can quite easily be used to speculate on a company&amp;#8217;s demise.)  The Fed bailed out AIG because the company could not raise the $14.5 billion in collateral it needed to avoid bankruptcy. And unlike the insurance plans or retirement portfolios, the CDS contracts would be at risk in the event of bankruptcy.  If all of a sudden a huge swath of CDS contracts were effectively canceled, then you&amp;#8217;d have a huge swath of the financial market holding all kinds of risk that it was trying to avoid in the first place. And as soon as that happened, that whole swath would likely start selling off those newly risky investments all at once, causing a huge seize-up in the credit markets. And the credit markets, remember, are how companies get short-, medium-, and long-term loans to fund their daily operations (read: things like payroll for their employees). And so if AIG went under, the negative effects would work their way very quickly from Wall Street down to Main Street.  At least, I think that&amp;#8217;s how it all goes. In any case, you can assure yourself that Henry Paulson and Ben Bernanke wouldn&amp;#8217;t be doing this if it were at all avoidable. I mean, just think what this means: a Republican administration has effectively nationalized one of the world&amp;#8217;s largest insurers. It&amp;#8217;s funny how a little financial panic turns everyone into a socialist.
