AIG, the insurance icon was bailed out by the federal reserve bank because it was considered too big to fail and its failure would have a monumental impact on the global financial landscape. On the other hand, Lehman brothers was considered too inconsequential to save. what an irony. The impact of the global economic meltdown is just beginning to hit home. These are trying times for any trader out there. I wonder what trades you can confidently put on. I heard suzy Orman on Larry King saying this aint time to buy stocks. This is certainly the best time to take a vacation. Your money aint safe out there. The market volatility is such that only the brave dare enter.I accept my position in the toatl financial landscape. I am too small to matter. I better stand aside.
