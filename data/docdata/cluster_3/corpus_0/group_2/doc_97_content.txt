He does like to gamble, you know. And he wants to gamble with your health insurance. Krugman quotes McCain:  Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.  Emphasis added by me.  He wants to put your Social Security into the stock market too. Does that make you feel safer? Not me. McCain's trying to pose as a big believer in government regulation and oversight, now that the market is finally trawling the bottom. But don't believe him. He's always been a deregulator, as are all his economic advisors. And deregulation got us into this mess. McCain isn't capable of getting us out again.
