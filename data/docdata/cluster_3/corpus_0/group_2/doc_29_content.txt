 The news of a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac conservatorship sent the markets up in Monday morning trading, but one financial firm not benefiting from the news is troubled Lehman Brothers Inc., which was down $2.34, or 15%, at 11 a.m. EDT. It's not clear why, but intense media rumors and analyst speculation about the troubled investment bank continue to dominate the news. One of the latest stories comes from the Financial Times, which reported that Royal Bank of Canada had considered a bid but backed out because it deemed Lehman's mortgage holdings too risky. Another comes from former Lehman CFO-turned-Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. analyst Brad Hintz, who said that Lehman's best bet for survival is a combination of a management buyout of its Neuberger Berman LLC asset management unit, further write-downs and the disposal of its commercial real estate portfolio.
