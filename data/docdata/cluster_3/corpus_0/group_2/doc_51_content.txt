Looks like a blood bath will happen when the markets open in the morning.  S&amp;P futures are down 46.30 and Dow futures are down 360.  Lehman Brothers is bankrupt.  Merrill Lynch is being taken over by Bank of America.  Gold and Silver are skyrocketing.  Banks have been failing all year.  I took all money I could access out of the bank.  Damn ATMs only allow you a few hundred dollars a day.  All I can do now is hope the situation improves while I sleep.  Nah, ain't gonna happen.
