This morning we woke up to another Monday, and another financial institution falling before we even had time for our morning coffee&amp;#8230;and the news only got crazier as the day went by! If you&amp;#8217;re anything like us and scrambling to keep up with all the financial news today, here&amp;#8217;s a rundown of the highlights: Citigroup bought out Wachovia&amp;#8217;s banking operations overnight for $2.2 billion just as the ailing bank was nearing collapse. This deal further consolidates most of the banking industry in the hands of three major commercial banks: Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America. Wachovia stock plunged nearly 90% overnight, but never opened for trading on Monday morning.[NYT]  The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted a total of 777 points today alone &amp;#8212; the largest single-day drop in history (in points, but not in percentage), with a 250-point drop within half an hour of the opening bell this morning.[Washington Post]  It&amp;#8217;s not all bad, though&amp;#8230;.oil has dropped to under $100 a barrel.

Amidst all the economic turmoil, thereisstill an election going on&amp;#8230;with politicians, journalists, and reporters from both sides of the aisle pointing the finger at each other over why the bailout didn&amp;#8217;t pass. The Wall Street Journal has an interesting roundup of commentary from both sides &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;Choose your political scapegoat,&amp;#8221; says the WSJ, &amp;#8220;because theres plenty to go around.&amp;#8221; [Wall Street Journal]  Extra credit if you can understand all the ever-changing events of the last three weeks!&amp;#8230;well, this handy interactive timeline from the New York Times might help.
