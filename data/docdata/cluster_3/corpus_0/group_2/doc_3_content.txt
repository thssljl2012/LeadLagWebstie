Well, I've refrained from commenting on the bailout because I just don't know what to think. I understood the $85 billion AIG bailout, even though I have no idea where that money is coming from. AIG holds the insurance policies for millions of Americans. But this $700 billion--can anyone even conceive of that much money?I guess what's so disturbing is the speed with which the Bush administration has tried to push this through--the same speed with which they pushed through the Patriot Act, the clearance for the Iraq War, etc. It's always the same message: "Trust us." And always the insinuation that, if this isn't done NOW, and exactly the way Bush wants it, horrible consequences will result.Also, this $700 billion does not include financial assistance to homeowners. Some of you may know that I opposed the idea of bailouts to help people with foreclosures. I don't believe that the government should step in to invalidate a private contract like a mortgage, and to keep those who bought things they couldn't afford from facing the consequences. No one is ever going to reward those people who saved for a down payment, bought smaller homes than they would have liked, and generally lived within their means.But. I don't know where Bush gets the balls to ask for a $700 billion Wall Street bailout without some homeowner assistance. I mean, is there any clearer way to state what your priorities are?
