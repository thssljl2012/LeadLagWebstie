Sorry for this post, but i have to say this, that i am sad to see many financial companies, especially in the U.S. are having trouble.Lehman Brothers have filed for bankruptcy, while American International Group (AIG), also faces financial difficulties and is taken over by the Federal Reserves.AIG is the Group that sponsored Manchester United. But looks like Man Utd are still doing business as usual, no negative effect on them.But i want to say this, we are seeing one of the worst financial slumps in history. Lehman Brothers and AIG are both great and big financial and insurance companies respectively. AIG is the biggest insurance group in the world, and Lehman Brothers is one of the big investment institutions.It's sad to see the downfall of the world economy. We as futures of this world, are to enter our future seeing all these results. It will somehow affect our confidence, making us wonder what worse thing can happen to our future, career, children, and children's careers.Hope to see a better future. It sounds ironic, because we all know the world is going to get worse, with the end time nears. But, we can still hope, we can.
