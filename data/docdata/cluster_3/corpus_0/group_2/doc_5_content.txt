     As we all collectively pause and reflect on our new socialized economy, let's take a look at McCain's responses to the collapse over the course of the past week.&amp;nbsp; On Monday, he declared &amp;quot;the fundamentals of our economy are strong.&amp;quot; And then spent all Tuesday explaining himself, stating that the economy, while strong, was in &amp;quot;crisis.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;On Tuesday he also indicated he opposed a federal bailout of insurance giant AIG.&amp;nbsp; On Wednesday?&amp;nbsp; McCain said that the bailout of insurance giant AIG was &amp;quot;unavoidable.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; On Thursday, McCain said he would fire the chairman of the SEC (although the President doesn't have that power) and on Friday McCain said he would strongly encourage SEC Chair Christopher Cox hand in his resignation.&amp;nbsp; On Friday, McCain also listened to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's bailout plan and then McCain outlined his own, more limited plan.&amp;nbsp;   I get flip-flopping, I do.&amp;nbsp; People's minds can change over time, circumstances grow different.&amp;nbsp; Your boyfriend falls out of love and makes you look the fool while leaving you crying in a crumpled mess while he goes off with another.&amp;nbsp; But, seriously, THIS many changes in the course of one week?&amp;nbsp; It comes across as McCain speaking before he truly understands the problem.&amp;nbsp; Taking action before grasping the width and depth of the circumstances and that, is a very troubling trait in a Commander in Chief.
