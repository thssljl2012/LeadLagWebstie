          What a dramatic day for the Fed and the investment banking community. Now that both Bank of America and Barclays have bowed out of the running to serve as white knight for Lehman Brothers, which is announcing plans for a Chapter 11, it appears that Bank of America, which recently swallowed Countrywide, is finalizing talks around a potential merger agreement with Merrill Lynch. It&amp;#8217;s hard to believe that the credit and real estate bubble from 2002-2006 could take down this many old line Wall Street firms (thank you Mr. Greenspan, along with your Greenspan put), but it appears that it&amp;#8217;s finally time for the chickens to come home to roost. For decades, the Fed and the US government have subsidized the risk for countless investors and corporate managers, going back to the S&amp;amp;L crisis and 1987 stock market crash, all the way through the bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac just last week. As tough as it is, perhaps we can start encouraging personal and corporate fiscal responsiblity and end the cycle of passing along the costs of poor decision making to someone else, namely taxpayers who are in a position to help out by virtue of their own solvency.
