Filed under: Law, Scandals, Bank of America (BAC), Countrywide Financial (CFC)Bank of America's (NYSE: BAC) newly-acquired Countrywide Financial is being sued by yet another state attorney general, with Indiana's Steve Carter announcing on Sunday that he's suing the company for deceiving borrowers into loans that they could not afford and/or were not aware of the associated risks.In a press release announcing the suit, Carter said that "These unfair lending practices may have harmed thousands of people and, in turn, negatively affected our communities and neighborhoods throughout the state." According to Carter, "The most common misrepresentations uncovered to date have been on 1) pre-payment penalty terms, and 2) the time period in which interest rates would be recalculated (resetting ARMs - adjustable rate mortgages)."Carter is seeking penalties of up to $15,500 per violation, plus investigative costs and restitution.Countrywide had been sued many times before the Bank of America acquisition, and BofA knew that there would be more to come. But for a deal that is widely considered to have been too expensive and too risky, the distraction and headache of all these lawsuits would seem to make this a deal Ken Lewis probably regrets. Of course, he won't say that publicly.Read   Permalink   Email this   Comments
