Last Tuesday evening I was on CNBC's Mad Money with Jim Cramer...I had&amp;nbsp;received an email from Jim's producer, Ben Rippey, and I returned the call.&amp;nbsp; I had emailed Jim about putting Bank of America's ceo on Cramer's "Wall of Shame", a prop used for those ceo's of companies who have run their businesses into the ground.&amp;nbsp; I had sent that email at least&amp;nbsp;4 weeks ago, when it was apparent that Bank of America's (ticker BAC) debt level dropped to&amp;nbsp; Negative 25 percent, then as&amp;nbsp; quickly as a week, dropped to Negative 46%!&amp;nbsp; BAC had just finished the purchase of Countrywide, the mortgage broker, who, I believe was responsible for many of the rotten mortgages that so many people were sold, and behind alot of the crisis we're in, now.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; BAC didn't even consult shareholders over this, either!&amp;nbsp; Personally I thought that Countrywide should have just gone belly-up, since they brought all of this on themselves! &amp;nbsp; But the ceo of BAC had just written in the annual report that BAC's major porblems were because of collateral debt obligations!...translation: mortgage loans, any loans that had defaulted...so what does he do?&amp;nbsp; Buy Countrywide!&amp;nbsp; Personally I can't stomach any debt, but this was just plain Nuts!!!&amp;nbsp; I didn't go-off like Cramer did, but I did express my frustration.&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; By the time I heard back from Cramer's people I had already sold-off all of my BAC shares&amp;nbsp;after seeing how much debt they had incurred as a result of the Countrywide acquisition, and the stock dropped into the $20.'s&amp;nbsp; It was like saying Good-Bye to an old friend, as BAC has always paid a very generous dividend.&amp;nbsp; I don't know how they can afford it, now...until Cramer responded on the show, Tues. nite.&amp;nbsp; Corporate Welfare at its finest...Republican Socialism, defined.&amp;nbsp; So, now, with&amp;nbsp;all of this Fancy Financial Footwork, the American taxpayer will, once again, pay.&amp;nbsp; We are already trillions of dollars in debt...the National Debt...so when and how are we going to pay this debt?&amp;nbsp; And guess who's funding all of this debt?&amp;nbsp; The Chinese! (Here we go again!)&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp; So before I go off on THAT tangent, again, here is the footage from CNBC's website...it's about 15 minutes long.&amp;nbsp; I could hear him over the phone when he started talking about Spaghetteos....yes, Spaghetteos!!!&amp;nbsp;  http://www.cnbc.com/id/25917101 &amp;nbsp; Btw, even tho Cramer said it's ok to buy financials, again, and we've reached the bottom?&amp;nbsp; I disagree...BAC and other financials still have alot of unaswered questions, are in dire need for more transparency, and already the former Governor of California, Jerry Brown, has filed a lawsuit against mortgage companies, there, on behalf of homeowners...BAC is now wide-open to those lawsuits.&amp;nbsp; Too soon, Jim.&amp;nbsp; Just my honest opinion.
