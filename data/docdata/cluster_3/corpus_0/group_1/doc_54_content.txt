An article in the Times reports that the second largest bank in the UK, Royal Bank of Scotland, will announce it has made a loss of $1billion in the first half of this year. Other banks are also in financial disarray. HSBC will write off $7 billion of bad debts thanks to the floundering of its US based business deals. Barclays Bank will write off another $6 billion of debts and their profits will be down 35 percent to $2.6 billion. Alliance &amp;amp; Leicester announced a 99 percent drop in profits, and the bank will be taken over by Spanish banking giant, Banco Santander. The effects of the credit crunch continue to infect other areas of the economy, as the world seems to be heading towards a recession.
