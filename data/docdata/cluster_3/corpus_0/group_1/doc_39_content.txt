Good morning, here's programme producer Richard's look ahead to tonight's programme:   "A fair amount around on the economy today - more bank write-downs, this time for Barclays, and RBS's results tomorrow are expected to be pretty dire; also there's an interest rate decision at noon - any move would be big news; and Robert Peston's interviewing the chancellor this morning - will he clarify the government's position on stamp duty? If not, why would anyone buy a house until he does?   We've the second in Rupert Wingfield-Hayes's reports from inside China - what impact is the Olympics really having in terms of openness and human rights for ordinary Chinese? Plus George Bush arrives there later today, and it'll be the morning of the big day in Beijing by the time we're on air.   Other stuff around Is Musharraf about to be impeached - dare he finally leave Pakistan for the Olympics? Will there be a breakthrough in the Zimbabwe talks - Mbeki flying to Harare today would suggest it's imminent. The PM is to launch his own TV channel - Number10TV. Bin Laden's former driver expected to be sentenced later today.    Anything else take your fancy? Plenty of room in the programme for other stories.   Richard"
