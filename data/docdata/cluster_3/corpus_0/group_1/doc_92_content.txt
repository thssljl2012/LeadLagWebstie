Merrill Lynch's recipe for settlements of CDO indemnity obligations may be &amp;quot;a template for Wall Street, Bank of America Corp. analysts said.&amp;quot; John Glover, &amp;quot;Merrill CDO Deal May Be Model, Bank of America Says (Update 1)&amp;quot; (Bloomberg.com, Friday, August 1, 2008). Another description from a different analyst is that Merrill may have set a &amp;quot;benchmark&amp;quot;. John Glover, &amp;quot;Merrill Gives Up Gains, Is 'On Hook' For CDO Losses (Update 2)&amp;quot; (Bloomberg.com,Wed., July 30, 2008). Yet a third description of this conduct is that Merrill Lynch has ushered in &amp;quot;a sea change in the way banks are approaching their holdings of troubled investments.&amp;quot;Jenny Anderson, &amp;quot;An Investment Firm That Prospered From Past Crises Turns to Mortgages&amp;quot; Business Day Section, p. C1, col. 3 (New York Times Nat'l Ed., Wed., July 30, 2008). Here is what Merrill arranged. It held Collateralized Debt Obligations. It sold them to Lone Star Funds. The sale price was in the neighborhood of 22 cents for 100 cents or 22 cents on the dollar. Merrill loaned Lone Star 75% of the 22 cents-for-100 centspurchase price. Glover, &amp;quot;Merrill Gives Up Gains, is 'On Hook' for CDO Losses (Update 2)&amp;quot;, supra. To fully understand the potential significance of this transaction, it is reported that some accounting information will help. &amp;quot;Investment banks [like Merrill Lynch] can book a gain if an insurer is willing to pay more to terminate its liability on a default swap contract than the amount at which the bank has it on its books, Bank of America said.&amp;quot; Glover, &amp;quot;Merrill CDO Deal May Be Model, Bank of America Says (Update 1),&amp;quot; supra. [Emphasis added.] Unknown, unnamed &amp;quot;analysts&amp;quot; say: &amp;quot;'Monetization of these gains, we feel, would follow.'&amp;quot; Id. I think this means that right now, no-one can honestly say what these paper accounting &amp;quot;gains&amp;quot; are worth. They do know enough to know, apparently, that an insurer shedding liability on &amp;quot;a default swap contract&amp;quot; is a postiive gain. Insurance regulators will otherwise &amp;quot;probably&amp;quot; take over the Insurance Companies &amp;quot;and pay the holders of municipal bonds they guaranteed before the banks,&amp;quot; according to &amp;quot;the analysts&amp;quot;.
