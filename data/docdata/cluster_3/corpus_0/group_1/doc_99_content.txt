The more the PM and the Treasurer bash the banks, the more they hurts Australian borrowers. Bank-bashing may feel good at the time but the subsequent pain will outweigh  heavily  the momentary pleasure. Anyone who understands the economy should understand that. Anyone who understands economics? That apparently doesn&amp;#8217;t include the Reserve Bank&amp;#8217;s Deputy Governor Ric Battelino, who made these remarks to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics yesterday, reinforcing a &amp;#8220;detailed case&amp;#8221; from Assistant Governor Phil Lowe: When we look at bank profitability, we find that Australian banks are around the top of the international range. On the surface, this could indicate a lesser degree of competition than elsewhere. But when we look a bit deeper it seems that an important reason for the high profitability of Australian banks is their unusually low bad debt experience. That&amp;#8217;s directly opposed to Planet&amp;#8217;s arguments, any disagreement with which she denounced as &amp;#8220;hypocrisy&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;ignorance&amp;#8221;. Let&amp;#8217;s dwell on the first of those adjectives. Stephen Mayne revealed on Tuesday that Albrechtsen&amp;#8217;s husband John O&amp;#8217;Sullivan works in the banking sector, and that their family wealth was enhanced by remuneration including Commonwealth Bank shares worth $5.1 million at the time O&amp;#8217;Sullivan received them as a senior CommBank exec. Does Janet disclose any of this? And this is the mob who have been crusading all week for the public &amp;#8220;right to know&amp;#8221;?
