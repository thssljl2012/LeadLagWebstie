National organiser Bella Pardoe said that the meeting was productive and has delivered greater clarification for affected staff. Affected staff can express their preferences about their future to the bank, which is good news, said Bella. The most important clarification is that staff who dont want to apply for one of the remaining roles in their area or be redeployed into another role can tick the I would like to consider other options box. Ticking this box will be seen as a clear indication that you are seeking to be made redundant.  Finsec will be communicating with members throughout the coming weeks, and has set up an email address, offshoringsupport@finsec.org.nz, where affected staff can get legal advice. Meanwhile, Westpac Australia announced this week that they were considering offshoring 55 positions at Concord Operational Centre to Genpact in India. A final decision will be made in October and the actual jobs will be offshored in February 2009.
