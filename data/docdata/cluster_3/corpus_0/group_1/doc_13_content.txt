The upside came from sales as the company was able to offset commodity cost pressures largely through price increases and SG&amp;amp;A leveraging. Full fiscal year 2008 (June) EPS was $3.50, vs. $3.04. We are maintaining our fiscal year 2009 EPS estimate of $3.88, which excludes a projected $0.12 in &amp;#8220;incremental&amp;#8221; rather than &amp;#8220;ongoing&amp;#8221; restructuring costs, but includes about $0.04 from the coffee business. PG projects that the reverse Morris Trust transaction on the Folgers coffee business may be completed in the December quarter. -L. Braverman, CFA S&amp;amp;P MAINTAINS BUY OPINION ON COVIDIEN SHARES (COV; 52.89): June-quarter operating EPS of $0.72, vs. $0.64, is $0.07 above our forecast. Revenues of $2.6 billion topped our $2.5 billion estimate, reflecting better-than-expected organic growth and stronger forex tailwinds than forecast. We view the EPS upside as high quality; achieved despite a higher tax rate than expected. COV&amp;#8217;s guidance for full fiscal year 2008 (September) was not revised, due to an expected September-quarter sales slowdown and higher raw material costs. But we raise our fiscal year 2008 forecast by $0.04 to $2.60 and fiscal year 2009&amp;#8217;s by $0.15 to $3.00, and our target price by $5 to $60 on a forward p-e and price/sales in line with peers. -R. Gold S&amp;amp;P UPGRADES OPINION ON SHARES OF W&amp;amp;T OFFSHORE TO BUY FROM HOLD, ON VALUATION (WTI; 37.87): Q2 operating EPS, after $0.10 derivative loss, is $1.77 vs. $0.60. Before losses, EPS of $1.87 beats our view by $0.17 on 48% higher natural gas prices and lower-than-projected operating and DD&amp;amp;A expenses. Production of 31 Bcfe missed our 32.2 Bcfe projection on equipment delays and lowered well count. WTI plans to update its 2008 capital budget by the end of August. We still see $6.47 2008 EPS, but we raise 2009&amp;#8217;s forecast by $0.71 to $6.67 on lower costs and higher prices. On lower relative metrics, blended with DCF, we reduce our target price by $10 to $54. -M. Kay Track S&amp;amp;P picks at: http://trackthepros.com/categories.php?category_id=382 UBS UPGRADES AIG TO BUY FROM NEUTRAL UBS analyst Andrew Kligerman says American International Group&amp;#8217;s (AIG) valuation of 0.81 times book value (excluding accumulated other comprehensive income ) discounts its ultimate economic loss exposure in its AIG-Financial Products credit default swaps and insurance investments, and fails to recognize its 14%-plus operating return-on-equity (ROE) potential under difficult market conditions. Kligerman thinks AIG is well-positioned to absorb further losses &amp;#8212; without a need for an equity raise &amp;#8212; given its second quarter 2008 capital raise of about $20 billion, operating EPS power, and debt capacity. He notes that with $55 billion in cash/short-term at first quarter 2008 (vs. $29 billion in the second quarter 2007), AIG seems well-equipped to meet liquidity needs. He sees $1.80 2008 operating EPS and $5.43 for 2009. He raises $35 12-month price target to $41.

Kumar thinks Cree should be in a position to meet Street estimates of $0.09 EPS on $131.1 million revenue for the June-quarter. He also believes Cree&amp;#8217;s core business is poised for growth in the September-quarter, for which the Street is looking for $0.10 EPS on $137.0 million revenue. He notes that the June quarter will be the first quarter that investors will be able to get some transparency and an apples-to-apples comparison since COTCO was acquired on Apr. 2, 2007. http://trackthepros.com/categories.php?category_id=1406
