 Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo have committed to issue covered bonds (WSJ).  While these securities are highly popular in Europe, US banks have been reluctant to issue them given unclear regulatory requirements.Covered bonds remain on a bank's balance sheet backed by a set of securities called a 'covered pool'.  This arrangement improves disclosure and clarifies the issuer's commitments to the securities when compared with many securitizations.Lack of clarity around the composition of the cover pool, disclosure requirements, and questions about the relative seniority of covered bonds in a bankruptcy have hampered issuance in the US.  This was somewhat alleviated when voluntary guidelines were announced by the Treasury, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Thrift Supervision.  These offer guidance on the types of collateral issuers must hold and the types of disclosure that must be made to investors.  The guidelines require the underlying mortgages to have fully documented income, be up to date on payments, and to be replaced if they become 60 days delinquent.Covered bonds are the primary means of financing mortgages in Europe.  There are currently $2.5 trln of covered bonds outstanding in Europe.
