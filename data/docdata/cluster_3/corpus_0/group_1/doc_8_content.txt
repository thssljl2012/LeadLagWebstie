 Fannie, Freddie Fall on Likely Need for a Bailout (Update5)By Dawn KopeckiAug. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac tumbled to about 18-year lows in New York trading on concern the government will be forced to bail out the mortgage-finance companies, wiping out common stockholders.Fannie and Freddie each slid as much as 20 percent after Barron's reported that the Bush administration is anticipating the government-chartered companies will fail to raise the equity they need to offset credit losses, prompting the U.S. Treasury to act. The companies' stock market values are well below the minimum of $10 billion in capital that each would need to raise to ``have any credibility,'' Barron's said in its story.``We agree with the call for Treasury intervention and think it is very, very likely to happen before the end of the third quarter,'' Ajay Rajadhyaksha, the head of fixed income strategy for Barclays Capital Inc., said in a telephone interview today. ``Without government help, we think there is very little chance of Freddie completing a significant capital raising.''The government plans to recapitalize Fannie and Freddie with taxpayer money should their capital raising fail, Barron's said, citing a person in the Bush administration it didn't identify. A rescue of the companies, which own or guarantee 42 percent of the $12 trillion in U.S. home loans, would include preferred stock with a seniority, dividend preference and convertibility that would wipe out common stockholders, Barron's reported.Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who on July 31 received the unprecedented authority he requested from Congress to help the companies if needed, has said a bailout won't be necessary.``We aren't going to comment on speculation,'' said a Treasury spokeswoman, Jennifer Zuccarelli. ``As the Secretary has said, we have no plans to use these authorities.''
