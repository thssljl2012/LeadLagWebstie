The opposition parties are mired in squabbling, and Berlusconi, now prime minister for the third time since 1994, has an approval rating of 55 percenthigher than Britain&amp;#8217;s Gordon Brown, France&amp;#8217;s Nicolas Sarkozy or Spain&amp;#8217;s Jos Luis Rodrguez Zapatero. &amp;#8230; Such tough tactics could give Berlusconi the cover to tackle some of Italy&amp;#8217;s deeper issues.
