There are also two kinds of "independents".  There are independent advisors and then there are RIAs. An independent advisor still receives commissions.  An RIA does not.RIA stands for Registered Investment Advisor.So what's the difference?The independents are typically an insurance outfit like Transamerica or AIG or a broker like LPL. They'll have some snazzy name, "retirement planning group" and mention "safety", "security", "dreams" and have lots of pictures of old people and kids.Ameriprise plays in these waters too. Think Hawaiian shirt Fridays; these people make their own culture rather than having people promoted and demoted in and out. Its a kinder, freer life, outside of still being controlled by "home-quarters" and trying to sell you something.Typical "payouts" to your independent advisor is 80 to 90%. They cover their own office expenses and marketing (with help from the mutual funds and products they sell--think seminars). If your pen is from a fund company, I've got you nailed.Think large annuity and life insurance proposals. That is what you will see at some point in your journey with them. It may not be today, but you will--and then call me, so I can say...These "proposal products", as i so wittily call them, pay the independent "advisor" upwards of 7-10%. Ding. Ding. Ding.  Wait a minute, 1000 dollars in this pays me $700 dollars to sell to someone.  Where do I sign????Wirehouse brokers actually get screwed on this Manna from heaven-like product, getting paid 4-5% for the same product (and often have less choices).Insurance, ironically, is still one of the most profitable products to sell for a firm.Warren Buffet owning a series of insurance concerns is not a mistake.Registered Investment Adviser is the new future.
