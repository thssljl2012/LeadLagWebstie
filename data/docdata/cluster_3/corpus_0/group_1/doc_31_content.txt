Filed under: GreenFinanceThere is some debate over Bank of America and it's green initiative. On the one hand, the bank just built what is possibly one of the world's greenest skyscrapers. On the other hand they still fund some less than eco-friendly coal mining projects.Corporate investing practices aside, here's what BofA is doing on a more consumer level:      Green Banking Centers - a $1.4 billion piece of the $20 billion initiative is for building. The company plans to gain LEED certification in all new office and banking center construction. What does that mean for you? A new BofA built in your town could have solar panels on the roof, recycled blue jeans for insulation and pressed wheat counters like the new banking center in Adelanto, CA.      Brighter Planet credit card - the card lets you earn one EarthSmart point for every dollar you spend. The points are automatically redeemed each month to help community-based renewable energy projects in the US. For every $1,000 you spend, you could offset up to one ton of carbon dioxide.      Green Technology - BofA has joined with FDSI to reduce heating and cooling energy costs and its carbon footprint by 50% more than with traditional methods. This means BofA will pollute less while saving on electric bills. Maybe BofA will share the knowledge so we can all benefit.   So, if you are shopping for a bank and want to go with one that is working towards being more green, Bank of America might be for you.&amp;nbsp;Read&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Permalink&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Email this&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Linking&amp;nbsp;Blogs&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Comments
