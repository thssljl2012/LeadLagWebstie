US-Presidential Election 2008 Barack Obama, winning more than 2206 delegates (including441 superdelegates) has succeeded to clinch the Democratic Presidential nomination, while Clinton signaledthat she may be willing to become Obama&amp;#8217;s Vice Presidential nominee if it helps Democratic Party to win the White House.

US-Presidential Election 2008 Barack Obama, winning more than 2206 delegates (including441 superdelegates) has succeeded to clinch the Democratic Presidential nomination, while Clinton signaledthat she may be willing to become Obama&amp;#8217;s Vice Presidential nominee if it helps Democratic Party to win the White House. Clinton, the most successful female Presidential candidate in US history,ended her courageous campaign with an emotional speech, asking her voters to get behind Obama, endorsing his nomination and giving her full support to him. Obtaining a historic nomination becoming the first Afro American to be a major party&amp;#8217;s Presidential candidate,Obama may not be willing to consider any more to offer Clinton a spot on the ticket. However Obama and Clinton agreed on a jointpublic rally in an effort tounify Democratic party, cooperatein harmony and help retire her pending $20 Million campaign debt through new contributions fromObama&amp;#8217;s supporters. Having a huge fund raising success, Obama rejected Public Financing of his general-election campaign, becoming the first Presidential contender of a major party to do so.Former Vice President Al Gore, who lost the Presidential Election 2000 against Bush, many think the 2000 election was stolen from Al Gore, endorsed vigorously a Obama and will beeventually on the team ifObama wins the White House. Obama wants full voting rights at the Democratic convention for Florida and Michigan, having the rules committee agreed to let their delegates have only half a vote each as the two important states held their primaries in violation to Democratic Party rules, and it seems to be most likely the credentials committee will grant his request. With91 daysuntil Election on November 4, Democrats must turn their full attention to the General Election, aiming to reverse eight years of failed Bush/McCain policies that have weakened the United States. John McCain, 73, who secured his nomination, which will not become official until the Republican National Convention in September, is said to be a problem-solver who could bring spending under control, avoiding the steady collapse of the government&amp;#8217;s financial house. Federal budget has increased to $3,1 Trillion from $1,8 Trillion; the national debt is now $9 Trillion, more than the combined GDP of China, Japan and Canada, and adding Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security commitments, as a nation there is a $50 Trillion hole, an invisible mortgage of $450.000 for every American family. The federal spending, surging the federal budget deficit to a record amount of almost $482 Billion for the fiscal year ending September 30 - after three consecutive years of budget surpluses, the war on terror, federal judgeships and energy independence are all significant issues. General public concern, discontent and widespread dissatisfaction, only 29% of Americans approve the President, only 14% approve theCongress and just 6% view the economy positively,will conduce voters to choose the candidate they trust more to secure America&amp;#8217;s place in the world, a candidate with strong leadership qualities and capable to introduce and fight for a change! Republicans try to portray Democratic nominee Obama as weak in the fight against terrorism and Obama is ready and willing to fight Republicans over foreign policy and national security issues. If Obama can convince American voters he can protect them, then he cannot lose! The easiest way for McCain to lose Presidential election in November is to allow Democrats to tie him to Bush, considered an electoral liability for the Republican Party. With six consecutive months of job declines, rising rates of home foreclosuresand high energy and food prices the economy gets more at the forefront of the Presidential race and the debate is open. While McCain proposes tax cuts to stimulate the economy, giving most of the benefits to the wealthy and corporations, Obama is talking about a redistribution of the tax burden to reduce economic inequality, a real plan focusing on fairness and growth. Democratic Presidential nominee Barack Obama joined a congressional delegation visiting Afghanistan, Kuwait, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, Germany, France and Britain to prove his foreign policy experience, discussing in Baghdad the future strategy and a time horizon for a withdrawal of US combat forces from Iraq, suggested to take place by the end of 2010, or earlier. The objective of his tripwas to listen to leaders hehas been visiting to get a sense of what their interests and concerns are, giving a clear message that if elected to the White House, America will intend to continue to show leadership but with a style less unilateral and building partnerships around the world, defending a strong relationship between the US and Europe and engaging more actively with Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. What Obama wants to communicate on both sides of the Atlantic, the US and Europe, is the enormous potential ofus restoring a sense of coming together! CNN and Washington Post continue to put Obama ahead by 46%/42% respectivamente 46,5%/43,9%, Rasmussen&amp;#8217;s tracking poll makes it much closer with 44% to 43% and Gallup&amp;#8217;s latest tracking poll showed a 44% Obama/44% McCain pull even! McCain&amp;#8217;s campaign is moving on to direct negative attacks on Obama&amp;#8217;s character and Democrats are worried Obama is not doing enough to hit back at McCain, convincing also voters of the important more traditional blue-collar swing states, where Clinton won by huge margins in the primary contest, signalling that he understands their concern and feels their pain talking in a language people understand! The Democratic party&amp;#8217;s overall electoral advantage has still to translate into a comfortable leadby Obama in the Presidential Election race! Are the US ready for an Afro-American President Obama, a change we can believe in? It&amp;#8217;s only Obama who really brings along a change! http://usaelectionpolls.com/rss/current-democrat-polls.js &amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8211; 2. Economic Outlook - Excesses &amp;amp; Consequences Figures released show that US economic growth fell sharply in the last three months of 2007, as the credit crunch took effect, slowdown triggered by a slump in building activity by 16,9%, the biggest fall in 25 years, as housing prices collapsed. President Bush signed a two year bipartisan $168 Billion US economic stimulus plan with tax rebates for consumers and tax relief for business to calm financial markets and help desesperate homeowners. The Federal Reserve put into force liquidity measures with repeated interest rate cuts and lowered interest rates for banks for overnight loans from 2,25% to 2% (Fed Funds rate)and the discount rate from 2,50% to 2,25% (Federal Discount rate), taking into account the poor economic growth of0,9%on an annualized basis in the first quarter,declines in consumer spending, in housing prices and business investment, along with spreading unemployment reaching 5,5% in June, jumping to 5,7% in July and expecting to peak 6,4% in 2009.The IMF warned financial markets are fragile and there isstill no end in sight to credit crisis,estimating overall losses caused by the subprime mortgage crisis at about $945 Billion, including loans and securities related to commercial real estate, the consumer credit market and corporations potential losses; total losses of the US residential mortgage market could reach $565 Billion, compared toalmost $500 Billion in writedowns and credit lossesalready booked by financial firms. Dropping consumer confidence to the lowest in 28 years and falling again sharply in June, as anxious shoppers grapple with surging food and fuel costs and sales of new cars and trucks plunged to their lowest level in more than a decade, posting General Motors/GM a stunning $15,5 Billion second quarter loss, lowering Standard &amp;amp; Poor&amp;#8217;s GM&amp;#8217;s credit rating, there is an increasing awareness that the US economy isexposed to economic contraction, entering into asoft recession, butmight still grow up to 1,3% this year, as GDP rose at a seasonally adjusted healthy 1,9%in the second quarter, far above expectations a few months ago-the IMF sees a 0,5% US growth for 2008, reviving only gradually to hit 2% in 2009, while the IMF lowered estimate for world growth from 4,1% to 3,7%. The US one year inflation increased to5,02% in June (including food and enegry) and it will be a task of the Federal Reserve to monitor inflation carefully, as economic weakness and high inflationdevelop stagflation symptoms. Appearing to put slightly less emphasis on concern about rising inflation and inflation expectations and indicating continuedworries about weaker economic growth,the Federal Reserveleaves rates unchanged, keeping its federal funds rate at 2% and the commercial bank&amp;#8217;s prime lending rate at 5%, still withstanding a tightening of US monetary policywithincreasing interest rates.
