The deal is valued at GBP407.1mn for a 100% stake. The company reported revenues of GBP204.5million and a PAT of GBP20.2million for 2007. Axon is highly profitable and has a presence in the high end consulting business, apart fromother businesses. Axon&amp;#8217;s strong presence in Europe would be an added advantage for Infosys. With the acquisition of Axon, Infosys can now win large SAP related deals, leveraging on Axon&amp;#8217;s SAP consulting practice and its own market reach. The Axon advantage: A strong SAP practice, and a marquee set of clients Axon is one of the largest firms focused on SAP services and solutions. In 2007, Axon derived around 63% of its revenues from the European region and 20% from the consulting business, which commands high margins. The high margin consulting business of Axon seems to be the prime reason for the 33% premium that Infosys has agreed to pay for this acquisition. Axon also brings in a marquee clientele, which include Honda,Ford,Nissan,Mercedes, GE Capital, Barclays Bank, British Telecom, Vodafone,Motorola,Astra Zeneca, Novartis and GSK. The complementary client base would open up a lot of cross selling opportunities,leveraging on Infosys&amp;#8217; presence and market reach, and the Axon&amp;#8217;s expertise in SAP services and solutions consulting. Overall, this deal would lead to a wider clientele for Infosys, and help boost its European presence, at a time when the US market( a key one for Infosys- 60% of its business comes from the US) is slowing down. At the close of business on Tuesday, the Infosys stock was down, fearing a counterbid for Axon. Read Axon Group CEO, Stephen Cardell&amp;#8217;s interview to CNBC TV-18,here.
