Ok.  So we close on the house and to our surprise there's a extra fee from Countrywide, our mortgage and home equity line of credit (HELOC) lender.  It's over $100 and it's charged because we closed the line of credit.  I understand how they might try to scam us into paying a fee to close the HELOC if we hadn't yet paid off the mortgage, but really...doesn't the line of credit HAVE to close since it's legally a HOME equity line of credit, and the home was being sold?  In otherwirds, opening a HELOC with Countrywide at the time when we did means that we would eventually automatically be charged a termination fee.  When we obtained the mortgage and HELOC, we explicity asked the Countrywide agent whether or not there were early payoff fees and he told us that there were none.  Argghhh!I don't know how Countrywide can afford to piss off the customers who (1) pay off their loans rather than defaulting on them, and (2) who might otherwise consider using them as a lender in the future.  Up until this event, we had never had any problems with them.  Now, not only will we NOT use them in the future (or Bank of America, who've purchased them), but we're damn sure to advise others who have had the same experience to take the same action we are going to take......we are writing the state Attorney General's office.Meanwhile...take a look at this:http://www.responsiblelending.org/issues/mortgage/countrywide-watch/litigation/
