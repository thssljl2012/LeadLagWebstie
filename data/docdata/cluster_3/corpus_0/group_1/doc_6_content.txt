UBS, which is among the banks most battered by the credit crunch, said today that it would separate its flailing investment bank from its lucrative business of managing money for rich people, and, adding in its asset management arm, now exist as three autonomous divisions. Writing down more than $42 billion in assets over the course of a year and watching $40 billion in client money get yanked in a single quarter  are the sorts of things that make you go back and rethink your business model.  In UBS's case that rethink has led to the conclusion that the concept of universal bankinghaving retail banking, investment banking, wealth management, mortgage lending, and fund management all under one roofis not such a good idea. "Our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated 'one firm' business model," UBS chairman Peter Kurer said. Deal Journal, over at WSJ.com, argues that UBS isn't the best test of whether universal banking works; the firm, they write, never fully integrated its divisions. What is happening there says more about its management than its model.  But that doesn't change the fact that the tide seems to be shifting on how big and integrated we want our banks to be. On the surface, it seems like diversification should steady financial institutions in times of tumult, but now, increasingly, it seems that what it actually does is add complexity and confound risk management to the point of some very bad things happening. Not to mention, some would say, stifle profits. For more than a year, critics of Citigroup have pushed for that company to break itself up in order to unlock shareholder value. In the past few weeks, banks like HSBC, Barclays and Societe Generale have felt the need to very loudly defend their own universal-bank models.  Where to look for insight?
