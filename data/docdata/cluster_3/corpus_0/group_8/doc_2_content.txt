I&#8217;m sorry, hold on a second. I&#8217;m feeling dizzy. On the eve of the summit, according to the commission, Sarkozy revised his rescue package for the French car industry to ensure that Europe&#8217;s level playing field in state aid to industry is maintained. But last night he delivered a withering attack on Gordon Brown&#8217;s scheme to help RBS and Lloyds Banking Group with state insurance for their 500bn-plus of toxic assets, in effect creating a &#8220;bad bank&#8221;. &#8220;Frankly, it&#8217;s not a procedure we wish to adopt,&#8221; Sarkozy said. Bad banks enshrined &#8220;nationalisation of the losses&#8221; caused by US mortgage-backed assets and meant they fell to the taxpayer. The British &#8220;bad bank&#8221; approach is pretty much the same as what the US is contemplating with Citibank, which unless I&#8217;m missing something means France is now distinctly less socialist than we are. Then again, they did invent the term &#8220;laissez-faire&#8221;.
