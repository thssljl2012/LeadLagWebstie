Barclays&amp;#8217; shareholders still haven&amp;#8217;t used to the idea that their shares have been diluted to the tune of 7bn, thanks to the bank heading to the Middle East to get a capital injection that means they won&amp;#8217;t have that pesky Alastair Darling taking an interest, and can carry on paying bosses whatever they like. While oil sheiks and male-journo fantasy figure Amanda Staveley did rather well out of the deal, you&amp;#8217;ve got angry stakeholders like Legal &amp;amp; General and Aviva saying the financing shouldn&amp;#8217;t have gone ahead;the latest to join the anti-sheik brigade is pensions and investment research consultants Pirc. So a rather rattled Barclays is taking two pretty bold steps to placate the baying, besuited mob. First up it&amp;#8217;s holding a meeting on the 24th at which shareholders can approve the fundraising, or not. Although many will be put off voting against the move because of the 300m in fees that have to be payed anyway, if Pirc et al manage to stimulate more ill-feeling, Barclays could be in real danger of a shareholder revolt. Secondly, it&amp;#8217;s been announced this morning that to calm the anger atSheikh Mansour and friendsgetting a better rate of interest on their investment than institutional shareholders, the deal has been modified to mean that the two major new investors will each have to make 250m of capital available to institutional investors to buy - this capital is the juicy stuff that have a fixed 10-year life and 14% return. But hell hath no fury like a shareholder scorned, so to further sate the bloodlust Barclays have decided to put up its whole board for re-election next year, rather than choosing to re-elect each director every three years. The bank has also joined Goldman Sachs in announcing that there will be no bonuses for directors this year. I wonder who&amp;#8217;s going to have the brass balls to announce that yes, we know that the public part-own us now, and yes, the silly bonuses are crass and offensive as jobs start to tumble, but you know what? It&amp;#8217;s been a tough year, we&amp;#8217;re really stressed out and we want our turkey stuffed with cash this year. And then pay themselves the usual eye-watering sums. My chocolate money is on JP Morgan Chase&amp;#8230;
