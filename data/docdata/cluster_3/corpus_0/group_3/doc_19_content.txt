 The BBC's Robert Peston has been getting it in the neck for his online communication style - in that comments he made in his Blog on the morning of 7th October about the Banks' need for capital, may have contributed to the downfall of the markets this week.  (You may recall that he was previously accused of virtually single handedly causing the run on Northern Rock.)  At issue this time is where and how he chose to reveal information that "a trio of the UK's biggest banks - Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, and Lloyds TSB - signalled to Alistair Darling that they'd like to see the colour of taxpayers' money rather quicker than he might have expected" - in his BBC Blog.
