One side effect of the current financial crisis is that an independent Scotland is looking less likely. No time to be a small nation in these troubled times, viz, Iceland, Belgium and Ireland. Remember that one of the main reasons for the Union with England in 1703was that the Scottish economy was bust. Halifax Bank of Scotlandis being given life support by Lloyds TSB, and Royal Bank of Scotland probablyover-reached by paying too much forABN Amro. A case of the Edinburgh bankers believing in their own omnipotence. If ABN Amro was anything like the many other European banks, then they bought a whole pile of trouble methinks. It&amp;#8217;ll all play itself out in the coming weeks and months.
