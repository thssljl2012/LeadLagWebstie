Here is how "London City" looks like (photo taken from live stream 5 minutes ago):"London City" is a district in London, EU, where people earn big bucks in finances.Today Gordon Brown, the unelected prime minister of UK, decided that UK government will buy  RBS, HBOS, Lloyds TSB. Since HBOS was overtaken by Lloyds TSB recently one could claim that since RBS and HBOS are Scottish ("S" = Scotland/Scottish) then simply Gordon Brown, himself Scott, has bailed out Scottish banks!This is not good for UK economy because government or political parties have no competence to manage/oversee banks and it all will end in squandering of taxpayer's money. Shortly speaking: it's big mismanagement and almost a socialism.I am worrying about the future of UK :-( because it is unhealthy for economy to bailout commercial institutions by government instead of letting the stronger ones (like HSBC) to buy weaker ones.Hard times for UK coming!
