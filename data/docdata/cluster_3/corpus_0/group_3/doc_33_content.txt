Right so that incredible 10BN that RBS was to raise via the taxpayer is actualy 20BN! That's a 60% stake in the company, unsurprisingly Sir Fred Goodwin has resigned, his company was valued at less than his share issue, eh was never going to last.The Government is buying 5 Billion of preference shares and a potential 15 Billion in ordinary shares if they are unable to find private investors, which is very likely.An amazing part of the deal that we didn't know before is that the banks have promised to keep mortgages and small business loans at 2007 levels, a lot more than they're curently doing! That surely shows quite how desperate the banks were for capital.The money for Lloyds HBOS is dependent on the merger taking place, which is under new circumstances, but we now know it will take place.What's going to happen with the Eurozone though? Germany are to announce a recapitalisation programme today and we could have an Eurozone-wide guarantee of wholesale lending which is huge.Also, what's going on with Barclays? They're going to fund 6.5BN of investment via the private sector.  Will they do it? They're not paying their dividends this 6 months but with shares rocketing up 15% I'm sure shareholders won't mind!And it's not a blank cheque, no cash bonuses for the director's. All bonuses will be share-based meaning director's have a stake in the long-term profitability of the company.A massive day and a massive Government intervention, it's looking like the first financial crisis of the global age could be turning a corner.
