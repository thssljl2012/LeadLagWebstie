How I think they are corrupt, incompetent, and nepotistic.  Well, as far as incompetent goes heres some more proof as if we needed it. .   From the BBC: Banking shares have fallen in London amid news that the bosses of big banks had met Chancellor Alistair Darling to discuss fundraising.   The falls were led by Royal Bank of Scotland, which fell 38%, followed by Lloyds TSB, which declined 20%, and Barclays, which was down 12%.   So yes, the top Gov financial bod gets a meeting with the biggest banks to reassure them and immediately afterwards their share prices fall, massively.  Im kind of thinking of Darling in the ridiculous Blackadder Goes Forth way.  Please remember folks, whether its tactical or as a choice, vote these people out wherever you can.
