LONDON'S FTSE 100 fell 2.47 per cent on Friday after shocking news from HBOS, Britain's biggest mortgage and savings provider, and the early collapse of the proposed bail-out of the US car industry.  HBOS sent a wave of panic through the banking industry, revealing its bad debts will top 8 billion ($18 billion) this year, wiping out more than half the 15.5 billion of emergency capital raised by the lender so far.  HBOS revealed that bad debts on mortgages, credit cards and corporate lending  plus write-downs on 'toxic' debts  had reached 8 billion in the first 11 months of the year.  The figure is a 3.2 billion increase since September alone.  Collins Stewart called the announcement a 'profits warning', adding 'we have very little confidence as book values continue to be impaired monthly'.  HBOS's Australian companies, including BankWest, Capital Finance, St Andrew's and BOS International, employ about 6000 people. The ASX climbed back from early losses to close down 2.43 per cent on Friday.  The other major European stock markets also fell, with the CAC 40 in Paris down 2.8 per cent and the DAX in Frankfurt falling 2.2 per cent.  In the US, the major indices closed up after President George Bush and the Treasury Department said they would consider using money from the $US700 billion ($A1.1 trillion) bail-out to help car makers, after Republican senators had earlier spooked international markets by refusing to support a compromise rescue proposal.  Treasury would provide short-term relief to GM, Ford and Chrysler to prevent imminent failure.  TELEGRAPH  Story Tools  Got news tips for us?
