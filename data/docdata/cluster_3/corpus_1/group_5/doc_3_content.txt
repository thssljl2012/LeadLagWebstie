Ratings agency Standard &amp;amp; Poors has downgraded the credit ratings or outlooks on 11 UK and US banks, including Barclays, HSBC and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Also among those downgraded are investment banks such as JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citibank, Credit Suisse, UBS, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank.   Responding to the news, the FTSE banking sector saw just six of the sectors 31 constituents showing a rise in share price as of 1pm today, according to Hemscott data. Of those downgraded by S&amp;amp;P, Barclays share price fell 0.71% as of 1pm, RBSs share price dropped by almost 5% and HSBC fell by 3.32%. The worst performer in the sector as of mid-day was still Anglo Irish on the back of news of its chairmans resignation in the face of issues of loan transfers at the group.  The FTSE 100 itself has been down today, falling more than 2% to hit a level of 4241 as of 1:30pm.   Earlier this week it was reported S&amp;amp;P had lowered its view on the overall strength of the banking sector in the US and UK, moving the two countries out of the highest of its 10 groupings of banks by country.   According to the US ratings agency the downgrades and revised outlooks reflect its view of the pressure financial groups are facing and the increasing bank industry risk resulting from the deepening global economic slowdown. Since mid June of 2007 it is estimated that banks worldwide have written down more than $740bn.   In its announcement of the downgrades, S&amp;amp;P noted the massive global government intervention seen in the sector over the past few months has been needed to stabilize the situation and restore confidence. These actions could help to reduce the pressures this sector is currently facing, it said.
