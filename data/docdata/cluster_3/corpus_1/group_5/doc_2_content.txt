Banks and City law firms are preparing an unprecedented jobs purge as the recession gathers alarming momentum. The CBI's dire prognosis for the services sector, which accounts for half of the economy, will cement fears that the UK is heading for a deep and prolonged recession. As BA unveiled 100 job cuts at Gatwick yesterday, a leading City economist warned that unemployment could soar to an all-time high by the end of 2010.   Gerard Lyons of Standard Chartered predicted that the jobless total will jump to 3.5m in two years, smashing through the previous record of 3.278m set in 1984.   Yet despite the deepening turmoil, Business Secretary Lord Mandelson yesterday warned that taxpayer cash would not be available to bail out failing companies. After pouring 37bn into the bank rescue plan, the government had no desire to write 'blank cheques' for other beleaguered industries, said Mandelson.   The news was a major blow to the car industry, which is in the midst of its gravest crisis for decades.   As politicians and America's biggest carmakers inched towards a 12bn bailout of the industry last night, the fate of tens of thousands of UK auto workers was hanging in the balance.   The CBI  Customer-facing companies, like pubs and travel firms, are also planning the deepest ever staff cuts after confidence plunged to an all-time low.   Two out of five firms across the services industry are planning to take an axe to headcount, according to an Institute of Directors survey published this morning. see our latest here
