Prime Minister Gordon Brown has told British banks they must own up to the extent of their bad assets amid more reports his government could launch a fresh bailout of the struggling sector.  In an interview with the Financial Times, Brown reportedly did not rule out the possibility that banks could get a further injection of taxpayers' money after big names including Royal Bank of Scotland were bailed out last year.  His comments came as shares in RBS and Barclays plunged on Friday on jitters across the sector as US giant Citigroup announced an $US8.29 billion ($A12.45 billion) fourth quarter loss and Bank of America got a $US20 billion ($A30 billion) federal bailout. 'One of the necessary elements for the next stage is for people to have a clear understanding that bad assets have been written off,' Brown told the Financial Times. 'We have got to be clear that where we have got clearly bad assets, I expect them to be dealt with.' Officials are reportedly working on plans to buy banks' bad assets outright and place them in a 'bad bank', or to underwrite the toxic assets.  The industry reportedly has some STG200 billion ($A439 billion) of bad assets.  2009 AFP
