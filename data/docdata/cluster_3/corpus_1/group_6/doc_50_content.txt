UK bank shares took a pounding on Friday, with Barclays stock losing 25% of its value and shares in the majority state-owned Royal  closing 13% down. Fears that the global banking crisis is entering a new phase and that governments will be forced to extend their bail-out plans were fuelled by the news that Anglo Irish Bank is to be nationalised and that in the US, Citigroup and Bank of America both posted losses for the third quarter of 2008.  The latter also received a $20 billion injection of cash from the Federal Reserve, to facilitate its integration of Merrill Lynch.  In the UK, Barclays responded to the fall in its share price by announcing that profit for 2008 will be ahead of the 5.3 billion forecast by analysts.  Short trading has again been called into question and blamed for destabilising the markets, the Financial Services Authority having lifted its temporary ban on Friday.  Speculation about the formation of a state-backed bad bank that could buy-up toxic assets and clean up banks balance sheets continues.  Ministers have so far distanced themselves from the idea but according to a report in The Daily Telegraph, the Treasury is working on a rescue plan that could involve the removal of 200 billion of toxic assets.  Meanwhile, Northern Rock would be transformed into a good bank that could be generous in its lending to individuals and businesses, the Telegraph reports.
