LONDON, Jan 18 (AFP): Prime Minister Gordon Brown told British banks yesterday they must own up to the extent of their bad assets amid more reports his government could launch a fresh bailout of the struggling sector.  In a Financial Times interview, Brown did not rule out the possibility that banks could get a further injection of taxpayers' money after big names including Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) were bailed out last year in a 37-billion-pound recapitalisation.  His comments came after shares in RBS and Barclays plunged Friday after US giant Citigroup announced an 8.29-billion-dollar fourth quarter loss and Bank of America got a 20-billion-dollar state bailout.  'One of the necessary elements for the next stage is for people to have a clear understanding that bad assets have been written off,' Brown told the Financial Times.  'We have got to be clear that where we have got clearly bad assets, I expect them to be dealt with.'  Officials are reportedly working on plans to buy banks' bad assets-exacerbated by some consumers and businesses' inability to pay their debts as the credit crunch bites-and place them in a 'bad bank', or to underwrite the toxic assets.  The BBC said the government would next week announce an insurance scheme which would allow banks to pay a fee and have their bad loans underwritten by the taxpayer up to a point.  The industry reportedly has some 200 billion pounds (222 billion euros, 295 billion dollars) of bad assets.
