A 37 billion rescue package for British banking was unveiled today, sparking an early rally on Londons leading share exchange.The dramatic bailout for three of the UKs biggest banks  branded unprecedented but essential by Prime Minister Gordon Brown  helped lift the FTSE 100 Index by more than five per cent to 4174 points.The Government announced it will buy 15 billion of shares in Royal Bank of Scotland as well as pumping in an extra 5 billion of emergency aid.Lloyds TSB will receive 5 billion of taxpayers cash in aid. HBOS will also receive aid worth 11.5 billion and the Government will buy a further 3 billion of shares in the stricken bank prior to a planned takeover by Lloyds TSB.Barclays said it is not turning to the Government for emergency funding, unveiling instead plans to raise more than 6.5 billion from investors to help its balance sheet. The high street bank also said it will not pay a final dividend for 2008, saving the group 2 billion.As part of the unprecedented deal, RBSs under-fire boss Sir Fred Goodwin, who earned 4 million last year and asked investors for 12 billion to help shore up the group, is also to step down.The Government revealed the bailout plan just hours after EU leaders signed up to Mr Browns blueprint for recovery.The announcement, after an emergency summit of eurozone countries in Paris yesterday, was seen as a significant personal victory for the Prime Minister with the US also on board following crisis talks over the weekend.Mr Brown said today: In extraordinary times, with financial markets ceasing to work, the Government cannot just leave people on their own to be buffeted about.For savers, for small businesses, and for homeowners, we must in an uncertain and unstable world be the rock of stability on which the British people can depend.It is understood the Government will own around 40 per cent of the new combined HBOS and Lloyds TSB bank and around 60 per cent of RBS, although the final figure will depend on the take-up of shares.By Business Editor Amy Bould
