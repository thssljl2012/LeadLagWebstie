Shares in HBOS (HBOS) were riding high on Wednesday amid rumours that key shareholder Standard Life is likely to back Lloyds TSB's 12 billion rescue deal.The beleaguered bank saw its shares climb by as much as 37% during morning trading as relieved investors piled back into the group. Around a quarter of Lloyds' top 20 investors also have holdings in HBOS, making it more likely the deal will proceed.Standard Life holds about 3% of HBOS shares and about 1.5% of Lloyds. This makes it the fourth biggest HBOS investor andthe eighth biggest in Lloyds.Prime Minister Gordon Brown has already stated his confidence in the deal being completed, but speculation that Lloyds may be seeking a better price sent HBOS shares plummeting on Tuesday - at one point being 14% down. Over the past two weeks, HBOS has halved in value.On Tuesday, Brown said: 'This merger between HBOS and Lloyds TSB is a matter of great detail. I'm confident from talking to people involved that this merger is going ahead. At the end of the da,y it is a matter for shareholders not a matter for Government, and I believe that some of the issues that were raised at the beginning are being dealt with and I am pretty confident that both parties want to go ahead with this deal.'Both banks have refused to comment on the rumours but say they are making good progress on the deal.However, some smaller investors are unhappy with the terms of the takeover, which currently offers 0.833 Lloyds shares for each one of HBOS'. This values HBOS at 9.8 billion.Have your sayThe reports of a renegotiated deal sparked debate on the Interactive Investor discussion boards.The Trigger called HBOS the 'bargain of the century', saying that 'it is safe as houses and it has a buyer already, at the current price of 126 pence, it is a massive discount to the offer price, while others might be contemplating a counter bid.'Stu-Boy was less bullish: 'I don't think now is the time to buy ANY banks. Maybe November 10th I could be tempted'.With regard to the current turmoil, Camcorder 1 sees an end in sight: 'I would be surprised if we had not past the half way point in the crisis now.Mondays fall capitulation, well lots of people started posting around the boards including on this one about how they had been wiped out and how they wish they had set guarenteed stop losses. That was encouraging as far a capitulation goes.'Trading on Wednesday proved positive for both companies, with HBOS closing up 21% to 148.1p, and Lloyds (LLOY) up 10% to 250p.
