(BizWorld) European shares opened lower this morning as investors tracked falls in the US last night. In London a short time ago, the FTE 100 index was down 69.1 points at 4,325.1.In Paris the CAC-40 was off by 9.03 points at 3,606.19, while the DAX in Frankfurt was down 73.49 points at 5,125.70. The falls snapped a two-day recovery and followed weakness in the U.S. and most Asian markets as fears of a global recession intensified.Commodity stocks led the losers in London, but most banks did badly as well.Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered lost between 0.9 and 4.9 percent.Lloyds TSB advanced 5.2 percent after the Independent said the UK government was considering a U-turn that would allow the bank to pay dividends to shareholders while still taking advantage of its 37bn bank bailout scheme.The Financial Times also said some of Britain's banks were urging the government to lift the ban on dividend payments imposed as part of the bailout of the crisis-hit sector.HBOS, which is to be merged with Lloyds, rose 2.6 percent, while Royal Bank of Scotland added 1.4 percent.RBS, Lloyds and HBOS 'would be well-served by paying some level of (low) dividend simply to re-enter the dividend list and allow income funds to again hold banks,' said Alex Potter of Colins Stewart in a note.'Beyond that, the payout would likely be limited by the wish to pay the government's equity injection down.'Copyright: Business World and Thomson Financial Previous StoryNext Story
