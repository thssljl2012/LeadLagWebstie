Barclays issued a defiant declaration of independence yesterday, saying it did not need to tap the Government for cash.The bank is desperate to avoid subjecting itself to ministerial terms and conditions by tapping the public purse.By turning down the Treasury's offer of money and pledging to raise 6.5billion itself on private markets, it should also be able to continue to pay out rich rewards to high fliers such as President Bob Diamond - and keep them in a job.Barclays: Desperate to avoid the ministerial terms and conditions which will come with a taxpayer handoutLast year the American banked a 6.5million bonus, making him one of the City's best-paid bankers.Barclays chief executive John Varley and investment banking chief Mr Diamond will stay on to lead it through the turbulent times ahead.The decision to raise more than 6.5billion on the markets also leaves Barclays looking healthier than RBS and the combined Lloyds-Halifax Bank of Scotland.
