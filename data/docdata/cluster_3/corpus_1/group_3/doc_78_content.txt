Qatar's stock exchange surged 7.4 per cent in early trading.Share planUnder the British government plan announced on Monday, RBS stands to increase its capital by 20bn.The UK government will buy 5bn in preference shares and underwrite a further 15bn.HBOS and Lloyds TSB will also take part in the government scheme 'upon successful merger', the British treasury said.But Barclays, another bank which had been expected to agree to government intervention, said on Monday that it would aim to raise 6.5bn through private investment.Banks participating in the scheme will attempt to sell ordinary shares to existing investors, backed up by the government.The government will buy up any shares left unsold.The government could also provide capital in return for preference shares, which could pay an annual dividend of about 10 per cent.The scheme means that the government could become a majority investor in RBS and HBOS/Lloyds TSB, should the latter two banks merge.Fred Goodwin, chief executive of RBS, will step down as head of the ailing banks and will be replaced by Stephen Hester, chief executive for British Land.
