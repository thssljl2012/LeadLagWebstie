Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling will be nervously watching events in the City for signs that their audacious 500 billion bid to beat the credit crunch has restored confidence in the financial markets.Despite the dramatic early-morning announcement, coupled with a surprise half-point cut in interest rates, the FTSE 100 Index plunged by more than 5% on Wednesday to its lowest level since 2004 amid growing fear of recession.The influential International Monetary Fund added to the gloom after warning of a deep downturn for the global economy, and there were deep losses on Wall Street, in France and in Germany.On Wednesday night, US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson warned: 'The turmoil will not end quickly and significant challenges remain ahead.' There are worries in both Westminster and the City that the Government's gamble may not be enough to stop the markets sliding and get banks lending to one another again, and questions over whether Mr Brown and Mr Darling have a Plan B if it fails.The Prime Minister and Chancellor will spend the coming days pushing for co-ordinated international action to restore stability to the financial sector.Mr Darling flies to Washington on Wednesday afternoon ahead of crucial meetings of the finance ministers of the G7 group of rich countries on Friday and the IMF on Saturday.And Mr Brown will be in close contact with his European counterparts ahead of next week's EU summit in Brussels, following criticisms that last weekend's pledge to co-ordinate their response to the credit crunch has fallen apart within days.Treasury officials are on Thursday talking with UK banks over the level of individual take-up of the Government's 50 billion recapitalisation scheme and the precise terms of the deals.Eight UK financial institutions - Abbey, Barclays, HBOS, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, RBS, Standard Chartered and Nationwide Building Society - have pledged to increase their capital by 25 billion, but Government will pump in the funds if called upon.
