The compensation limit for savers who lose money if a bank goes under is being increased from 35,000 to 50,000. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme will also pay out up to 100,000 to couples with a joint account. The new limits were unveiled by the Financial Services Authority which says they will come into force on Tuesday. They are part of the Government's Banking Bill which goes before MPs next week. Ministers have been under pressure to act since the decision in Ireland to guarantee deposits held with Irish institutions in full. The much criticised move has reportedly sparked a flood of British money into Irish banks. Savers have also rushed to put their money with institutions that have a Government guarantee or that are perceived to be strong. These have included state-owned Northern Rock, Lloyds TSB and Abbey, which is owned by Spain's Santander. Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced plans to increase the limit of the FSCS earlier this week. He has so far resisted calls to follow the Irish government and scrap the compensation limit altogether. The issue is almost certain to be raised at Saturday's emergency meeting of EU leaders in Paris to discuss the impact of the gobal financial crisis. Among others they will be joined by president of the EU Commission Jose Manuel Barroso. He has called for the compensation limit to be the same in all EUcountries, so none of their banks is disadvantaged.
