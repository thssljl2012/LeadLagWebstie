First Minister Alex Salmond is due to 'harness the firepower' of his top economic advisers to get the best deal for Scotland in the proposed HBOS takeover.The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) will meet in Ayrshire on Friday morning to discuss the 12.2 billion takeover by Lloyds TSB.'As decisions are being planned that will define the shape of that organisation, and the future of Scottish jobs and decision-making, we must make a clear and united case for Scotland as a world-class business base,' Mr Salmond said.'This is the time to harness the intellectual firepower at our disposal to promote Scotland's competitive advantage.'The First Minister added: 'We must ensure that the Scottish head office operations of the proposed new group are as large and substantial as possible.'Labour leader Iain Gray called for the meeting to be held in public.He described the potential takeover by Lloyds TSB as a matter of national interest - but this was rejected by ministers.The First Minister wants to retain headquarters functions and jobs at the Bank of Scotland's traditional home on the Mound in Edinburgh.Mr Salmond is preparing to lead a Scottish Government presentation to Lloyds TSB chairman Victor Blank, setting out the advantages Scotland has to offer companies as a business-base and centre of expertise in financial services.It emerged last month that Sir George Mathewson, who chairs the CEA, heads a firm involved in the 'short-selling' of stock market shares.Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.
