Britain's '50bn' rescue package for the nation's embattled banks will be unveiled by the Government this morning.Chancellor Alistair Darling is to announce details of the proposals, reported to involve up to 50bn of taxpayers' money, before the stock market opens at 8am.It is expected that the plan will include a cash injection for the banks to bolster their depleted balance sheets.In return, the taxpayer will own a stake in the banks.The package is also expected to include access to a stand-by facility for the banks to ensure they have sufficient funds for day to day operations.Details were finalised at a Downing Street meeting on Tuesday evening between Mr Darling, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King and Financial Services Authority chairman Lord Turner.It followed another torrid day in the markets which saw bank shares take a pummelling, massively increasing the pressure on the Government to act.The Royal Bank of Scotland was the latest institution to be heavily hit by the financial turmoil, seeing almost 40% wiped off the value of its shares.Lloyds TSB, HBOS, and Barclays also saw their share prices tumble amid uncertainty over whether the Government was prepared to act.The Chancellor announced after the talks that he would make an early-morning statement about proposals to put banks on 'a longer term sound footing'. Shortly afterwards there will be a: meeting of Gordon Brown's new National Economic Council 'war cabinet'; a Downing Street press conference with PM and his Chancellor; and a statement by Mr Darling to the House of Commons following Prime Minister's Questions.Shadow chancellor George Osborne repeated his willingness to cooperate with the Government, but warned the injection of funds could not be a bail out of failed bankers. 'We must make sure that any support from the taxpayer is used to help save small businesses from closure and enable families to stay afloat, not to pay the bonuses of bankers.'
