  LONDON (AFP) - Barclays on Monday turned down an offer of government help and said it planned to raise more than 6.5 billion pounds from investors. 'Given the strength of Barclays' well-diversified business and the existing capital base, the board expects that the additional capital will be raised from investors without calling on the government funding which has been offered,' the bank said in a statement.News of Barclays' independent fund-raising efforts comes as the government announced plans to invest up to 37 billion pounds in ailing banking groups Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS and Lloyds TSB.Government representatives could be installed on their boards in a move so unprecedented that trading in banks on the stock market could be suspended to allow traders to digest the news, newspapers reported.It would be the first implementation of a rescue package for banks announced last week, in which the government made available 5 billion pounds to inject cash into banks in return for shares.
