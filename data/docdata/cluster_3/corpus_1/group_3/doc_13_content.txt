First Minister Alex Salmond said on Sunday that he firmly believed there could be 'a positive result for Scotland' from the HBOS takeover. The Scottish Government's Council of Economic Advisers met on Friday to discuss the 12.2 billion takeover of the bank by Lloyds TSB.It comes as Mr Salmond is preparing to lead a presentation to Lloyds TSB bosses, setting out the advantages Scotland has to offer as a business base and centre of expertise in financial services.Both the government and business leaders want to retain as many jobs as possible in Scotland, as well as keeping decision-making functions north of the border. Protecting Scotland's leading position in financial services has also been identified as a priority.Mr Salmond said that a 'major component' of their case to Lloyds TSB was a framework approved by the Council of Economic Advisers at their meeting, called the Positive Case for Scotland. That highlights the significant growth there has been in the country's financial sector, making it one of Europe's leading financial centres.The framework points out Scotland is second to London as a financial hub within the UK, and with more than half of the top 20 financial services companies having significant operations in Scotland there is a critical mass of industry activity and specialist support services.As well as the existing workforce, there are more than 60,000 higher and further education students in Scotland currently undertaking business and finance related qualifications.Mr Salmond said: 'The proposed merger of Lloyds TSB with HBOS certainly represents a significant challenge, but also a major opportunity to present a wholly positive case in order to secure decision making functions and jobs for Scotland.'As we build on this framework and assemble the full presentation we will make to Lloyds TSB, it will become ever clearer that the case for Scotland is formidable, based upon the excellence and scale of the Scottish financial sector.'Mr Salmond stressed the strength of the country's financial sector and said: 'Over half of the world's top twenty financial services companies have significant operations in Scotland.'
