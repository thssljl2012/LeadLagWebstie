Barclays is on the verge of securing a 7 billion capital injection from Middle Eastern investors in a move that will enable the bank to avoid using the Government for financial support. Bosses are understood to be finalising deals with the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and an Abu Dhabi-based sovereign wealth fund. A formal announcement could be made later on Friday.If completed, the fund raising will help Barclays' chief executive John Varley recapitalise the bank without Government help.Barclays, along with Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and Halifax Bank of Scotland, was involved in recent talks with the Treasury over the historic multibillion-pound taxpayer bail-out.While the other three institutions collectively accepted 37 billion of emergency funding in exchange for giving up significant stakes to the Government, Barclays decided to go it alone, announcing plans to raise more than 6.5 billion from investors to help shore up its balance sheet.A cash injection from external investors means the bank will not be subject to Government investment conditions that restrict bonus payments to board members as well as dividend payouts.Barclays is expected to give existing shareholders the opportunity to participate in the latest fund-raising move.Earlier this year, Barclays raised 4.5 billion to help shore up its balance sheet.Cash-rich QIA was the biggest new investor, owning about 6% of the bank thanks to an estimated 1.4 million investment. Also new on board was Challenger, a wealthy vehicle led by the Qatari royal family, which is investing about 400 million for a stake of about 2%.Barclays also sold stakes to China Development Bank and Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group.
