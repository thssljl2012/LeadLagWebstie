Barclays is resisting quasi-nationalisation; the UK government will only be tapped if the planned cash call and balance sheet management fails. Statement:* The issue of preference shares to raise c3bn by 31 December 2008 as Barclays contribution to the commitment made by UK banks to increase Tier 1 capital by 25 billion in aggregate by year-end.* The issue of new ordinary shares to raise 0.6bn ($1bn) as announced on 17 September as part of our announcement concerning the acquisition of Lehman Brothers North American investment banking and capital markets businesses (the Lehman Acquisition). * The issue of new ordinary shares to raise a further c3bn as soon as practicable after the announcement of our full year 2008 results and our intention is that this should be before 31 March 2009. The offer of such shares will be structured so as to give existing shareholders full rights of participation.* Balance sheet management and operational efficiencies to release at least a further 1.5bn in equity resources.
