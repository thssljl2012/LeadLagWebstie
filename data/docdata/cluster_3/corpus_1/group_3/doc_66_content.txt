A dramatic rescue of British banking is under way after the Government unveiled a 37 billion bail-out for three of Britain's biggest banks.Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is to raise 20 billion of new capital through a Government-guaranteed 15 billion share issue and a 5 billion Government cash injection.Lloyds TSB is also to raise 5.5 billion of new capital, and said it was revising the terms of its acquisition of rival HBOS.As part of the unprecedented deal, RBS's under-fire boss Sir Fred Goodwin, who asked investors for 12 billion earlier this year to help shore up the group's balance sheet, is also to step down.
