Bank shares plummet in cash crisisShares in HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland plunged 42% and 39% respectively as mounting funding concerns piled pressure on the banking sector. HBOS's stock fell 66.8p to 94p, while NatWest owner RBS dived 58.1p to 90p, wiping around 8 billion off its market value. Barclays and Lloyds TSB were also down 9% and 13%. The slumps pegged back Footsie gains to 16 points, taking the index to 4605.2, as energy and wider stocks bounced back following Monday's massive sell-off. The banking sector woes stemmed from speculation the Government was considering taking some hefty stakes in banks to shore up their balance sheets, diluting other shareholder investments as a result. It also came as the banking crisis deepened in Iceland with the collapse of one of its biggest institutions, Landsbanki. HBOS topped the Footsie faller's board, with RBS close behind. HBOS's own funding woes have already seen it agree to a take over by Lloyds TSB, while RBS is seen as being among the most vulnerable to a European banking meltdown. Lloyds TSB slumped 33.5p to 225.5p, with Barclays down 29p to 285p. HSBC, which is much less exposed to UK and the Europe compared to its rivals, saw its shares rise 19p to 901p. It wasn't all misery in the financial sector, with insurers such as Standard Life in better shape after Monday's heavy falls. The company's shares were up 23p to 255p. Mining stocks also staged something of a recovery, with risers including Vedanta Resources, up 101p to 1005p. Eurasian Natural Resources firmed 34.75p to 459.75p. Oil prices ticking up a few dollars from the sub-90 dollar lows overnight appeared to have given a boost to the likes of BP and Royal Dutch Shell. BP added 17.5p to 447.25p, and its rival rose 47p to 1526p. Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.
