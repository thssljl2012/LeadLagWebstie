The potential takeover of Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) by Lloyds TSB could create the ninth largest insurance group in the UK.It is still uncertain whether the latter will keep HBOS' stake in its joint venture - Esure - or sell it.However, Peter Wood, Esure founder and chairman, said the merger would have little or no effect on Esure. He said: 'Esure is an independent joint venture. We are a rapidly growing, separately authorised, capitalised and well-reserved top 10 motor insurer with excellent brands and prospects. I look forward to continuing to develop the company and am happy to do this with the new shareholders. However, for Esure, Sheilas' Wheels and our other brands, it is business as usual.' Lloyds TSB currently underwrites only household and creditor business.However, the bank also runs an aggregator website and works with insurance partner Axa on lines such as commercial and travel and Royal Bank of Scotland Insurance on motor.
