Norwich Union owner Aviva today all but ruled itself out of bidding for the Asian business of troubled US insurance giant AIG, and moved to reassure the City it is financially secure.Insurers including Prudential have been eyeing the Asian operations, worth about 8billion, since AIG was bailed out by the US Government last month.But Aviva chief executive Andrew Moss today said: 'The case for us acquiring these assets is a very weak one.'No-go: Aviva thinks the case for buying AIG's Asian arm is weakAviva shares have recently been hammered by panic that insurers could be the next institutions to require a bailout or fresh injection of capital from investors.But Moss insisted 'the company is very strong' in terms of capital and liquidity. 'We have absolutely no need for fresh capital,' he said. 'We have a large surplus which will act as a buffer against what may happen in the next few months.'Aviva's 1.9billion capital surplus at the end of September has shrunk to a still-respectable 1.3billion today, and the firm said a further 20 per cent fall in the stock market would reduce it by another 400million to 900million.In terms of liquidity, Moss said insurance firms were much better-placed than banks.'We do not have the same liquidity issues as banks,' he said. 'We do not borrow in the market place and lend that out. That is just not what insurance companies do.'Shares in Aviva rose 22&amp;amp;quot;p to 268p today, having tumbled from 565p less than six weeks ago.Moss said: 'These are unprecedented times. Our share price has been affected by the huge uncertainty in financial markets, but people around the world are still saving and buying insurance from brands they trust, like Aviva.'The company reported a 12 per cent rise in new business sales in the first nine months of the year to 25.67billion - better than the 24.86billion predicted by City analysts because of strong growth in the US and Asia.But investment sales in the UK fell 43 per cent to 1.24billion, 'reflecting a market that is at its weakest for nearly two decades' as a result of the carnage in the commercial property market. Overall funds under management fell from 316billion at the start of the year to 235billion at the end of September.Moss said:''The current economic volatility is expected to continue to have an impact on our industry throughout the remainder of the year and into 2009. Consequently we expect to see some slowdown in sales in the remainder of 2008.'Aviva is looking at the terms of its planned 1billion payout to with-profits policyholders in light of the financial turmoil. The FTSE 100 index has tumbled from 5421 when the offer was unveiled in July to 3955.34 today.'Should these conditions persist, then the terms of the offer could change to ensure it remains fair to both customers and shareholders,' said Moss.Read laterEmail to a friendShare this article:View allAdd your commentsComments (0)No comments have so far been submitted.
