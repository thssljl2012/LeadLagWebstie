BRITAIN was set to announce a rescue package for its ailing banking industry before markets open later today, after shares in some of its leading banks plunged on concerns they were short of capital.After a crisis meeting in Downing Street with Prime Minister Gordon Brown and the heads of Britain's central bank and financial regulator, finance minister Alistair Darling said overnight he would make a detailed announcement within hours. 'The Bank of England has been putting substantial sums into the markets today, and is ready to do more when that's needed,' he said in a statement. 'We've been working closely with the governor of the Bank of England, with the Financial Services Authority and financial institutions to put the banks on a longer-term sound footing. 'I intend to make a statement before the markets open tomorrow morning, and I'll be making a statement to the House of Commons later in the day.' The meeting came after shares in some of Britain's leading banks plummeted on reports that the Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and Lloyds TSB met with Darling to request emergency funding.Despite denials from RBS and Barclays, RBS stock plunged more than 40 per cent, hitting a 13-year low in early trading, improving only slightly by the close of trade.Barclays and Lloyds TSB suffered smaller but still substantial losses.RBS stock has now fallen about 80 per cent in the year since the credit crunch began with the collapse of the US subprime home loan market.Just 12 months ago, the bank was riding high, leading a consortium in an attempted $US100 billion ($141 billion) takeover of Dutch bank ABN Amro.This year alone, Britain has nationalised two lenders.Northern Rock became the first casualty of the credit crunch when it made a request for emergency funding last year and was nationalised in February, while Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley was taken into government control last month.Several other countries have announced rescue plans for their banking industries, headlined by a $US700 billion ($987.03 billion) plan in the United States approved by legislators last week.Russia today announced an agreement to provide around $US36 billion ($50.76 billion) worth of credit for at least five years.Various European countries, meanwhile, have said they will fully guarantee depositors' savings, while others, such as Britain, have raised the amount protected.Finance ministers from the Group of Seven rich countries are due to meet in Washington later this week to discuss how to tackle the crisis.Separately, US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke hinted the central bank could cut its main interest rate as part of its efforts to stem a widening financial crisis.
