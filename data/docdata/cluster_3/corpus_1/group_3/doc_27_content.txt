The governments 37 billion investment in Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Lloyds TSB and HBOS is unprecedented but essential, Gordon Brown said this morning.Speaking as the government takes a 63 per cent stake in RBS and a 43 per cent stake in the soon to be combined Lloyds TSB and RBS, he said the action should start to make a difference but global action was needed.We must be a rock of stability, the prime minister said. At this time of uncertainty we want British banks to lead the world.We have made a series of investments but the government will not be a permanent investor.We are laying down conditions to make sure the taxpayer gets a fair deal.He added he would prefer for investors to come from the markets, but the government had been prepared to step in as a last resort.Mr Brown added the investment was not at the expense in spending in the health service or schools, and the taxpayer will benefit from the upside of the bank investment.He also explained the old bonus culture and risk taking will be replaced.Rewards will based only be on performance in the long term. We want fair reward for hard work and enterprise, not excessive risk taking.Alistair Darling said he thought it was extraordinary boards were not aware of the risks the banks were taking.Mr Brown also commented that the UK model would be copied around the world  including a redrawing of the US $700 billion bailout plans to include recapitalisation and further new plans in Europe.It is now agreed across Europe, to recapitalise is essential. We would prefer other investors, but as last resort the government will step in, he said.
