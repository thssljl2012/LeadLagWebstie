Gordon Brown has vowed to be a 'rock of stability' in the global financial chaos. He made the comments at a Downing Street conference this morning, after the Govenment's 37bn bail out of three high street banks. The Prime Minister said the action ministers were taking was 'unprecedented but essential'. 'In extraordinary times, with financial markets ceasing to work, the Government cannot just leave people on their own to be buffeted about,' he said.'For savers, for small businesses, and for homeowners, we must in an uncertain and unstable world be the rock of stability on which the British people can depend.'The Government is taking a 20bn stake in Royal Bank of Scotland with a further 17bn for Lloyds TSB once it is merged with HBOS.But Mr Brown said it would not be 'permanent investor'.
