Insurance giant Aviva yesterday warned that a planned 1billion handout to policyholders could be derailed by the slump in stock markets.The group, parent of Norwich Union, outlined a plan last July which would have meant payouts averaging 1,000 for 1million customers holdings policies in the company's with-profits fund.The cash was in exchange for customers giving up their claims to money in the fund which lies unclaimed because investors have died or cannot be traced.When the deal to compensate policyholders was struck at the end of July, the FTSE-100 stood at 5421. It has since fallen by 28 per cent.Marathon not a sprint: The payout offered last July may change with current conditionsAnd yesterday, Aviva's chief executive Andrew Moss said: 'Should these conditions persist, then the terms of the offer could change.'Aviva is not planning to scrap the payout. But it may change the terms, reducing the amount that goes to policyholders to reflect the fall in the value of the funds that will come under shareholders' control. The company doesn't have to make a decision before next spring.Aviva has seen its share price savaged as investors have fretted about the damage inflicted on its capital position by the credit crunch and the risk that it may have to cut its dividend - which totals about 1billion a year.But yesterday, the shares rebounded as the company revealed it has a financial surplus of 1.3billion.Even if shares were to fall a further 20 per cent, the company's surplus would be 900million.And Moss said that Aviva would maintain its dividend policy.'Share prices at the moment are being driven by fear,' he added.Aviva has already disclosed that it has exposure of 400million to collapsed US bank Lehman brothers and insurer AIG.Aviva's upbeat statement came just as Dutch insurance group Aegon struck a deal to take 2.4billion from the Netherlands government.The company had seen its capital base eroded by investment losses and its exposure to risky investments.Aegon has scrapped its final dividend after racking up a third-quarter loss of 280million.The company will have to repay the Dutch government at a premium or face an interest bill of 8.5 per cent.Last week, ING of the Netherlands accepted &amp;amp;pound;8bn in government support.Shares in UK insurers Prudential and Legal &amp;amp; General tumbled yesterday as investors voiced fears that the groups could face further losses that have not yet been disclosed.This was in spite of statements from both the Pru and L&amp;amp;G within the past fortnight that showed both companies to be financially comfortable.Read laterEmail to a friendShare this article:View allAdd your commentsComments (0)No comments have so far been submitted.
