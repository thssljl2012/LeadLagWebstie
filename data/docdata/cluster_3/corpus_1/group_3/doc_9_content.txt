Another 1billion was wiped off the value of HBOS yesterday amid mounting concerns over its emergency takeover by rival Lloyds TSB.Fears are growing that the hastily-arranged deal will drag the carefully-managed Lloyds into intensive care alongside the ailing Halifax owner.The realisation is dawning around the City that the dangers of swallowing the debt-laden HBOS greatly outweigh the benefit of creating a British retail banking powerhouse.Concern: Lloyds is ready to demand better terms for any HBOS deal amid fears a takeover could be more damaging than previously thoughtThe penny also appears to be dropping at Lloyds, which is considering re-negotiating the terms of the deal so that its investors get a bigger slice of the 'superbank'.City sources said Lloyds chairman Sir Victor Blank is ready to demand better terms for taking on HBOS.The ink is barely dry on the rescue deal, orchestrated by Blank and Prime Minister Gordon Brown, two weeks ago.But Blank's hand looks to be strong if he chooses to alter the original terms of the deal as the hurricane battering financial markets has become much more ferocious this week.Re- shaping the merger would highlight the shifting power dynamics between Brown and Blank.Blank knows the Prime Minister can ill-afford to nationalise another bank after the rescue of Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley this week.If Lloyds walks away, the government would have little choice but to take over HBOS, marking a new and more devastating twist in the financial market crisis.Under the current deal, Lloyds shareholders will get 60 per cent of the enlarged bank, which would control 30 per cent of Britain's mortgage market and 35 per cent of retail deposits.Following a 14 per cent slide in the HBOS share price yesterday, the bank is worth just 6.4billion - less than half Lloyds' 13.5billion market value.That suggests a one third split, two thirds split in favour of Lloyds investors, experts said.One top 10 shareholder in Lloyds (up 91/2p to 2261/2) believes Blank is in a very strong position to cut himself a better deal, particularly as no counter-bidder has emerged for HBOS.The investor said: 'With the current market conditions, HBOS is unlikely to find another bidder so Lloyds will have some flexibility in the terms.'Having to re-draw the deal would further tarnish Brown's reputation for fiscal prudence and blow a huge hole in the government's fiscal targets.Taking on HBOS's 680million mortgage and loans book would more than double the national debt, which stands at over 633billion.The City fears that the conservatively run Lloyds will find it more difficult and expensive to borrow money after swallowing HBOS.The Halifax owner raises over 40 per cent of its funds on wholesale money markets, which have frozen over because of the credit crunch.As Britain's biggest mortgage lender, it is also tipped to suffer huge losses on its loan book in the most severe housing downturn in decades.Many analysts believe the combined Lloyds/HBOS could face a shortfall of more than 10billion over the coming years as the saviour is tarnished by the saved.Lloyds boss Eric Daniels said: 'Market conditions are obviously difficult, but the acquisition of HBOS remains a fantastic opportunity to create the UK's leading financial services group and to create great value for both sets of shareholders.'Read laterEmail to a friendShare this article:View allAdd your commentsComments (0)No comments have so far been submitted.
