A dramatic rescue of British banking is under way after the Government unveiled a 37 billion bail-out for three of Britain's biggest banks. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is to raise 20 billion of new capital through a Government-guaranteed 15 billion share issue and a 5 billion Government cash injection.Lloyds TSB is also to raise 5.5 billion of new capital, and said it was revising the terms of its acquisition of rival HBOS.As part of the unprecedented deal, RBS's under-fire boss Sir Fred Goodwin, who asked investors for 12 billion earlier this year to help shore up the group's balance sheet, is also to step down.Sir Fred is to be replaced by Stephen Hester, currently chief executive of British Land.It also emerged that HBOS will raise 11.5 billion of additional capital, including 3 billion through preference shares with the UK Government.As part of the plans, the Government has pledged to review the remuneration of senior executives - both for 2008, when it expects no cash bonuses to be paid to board members, and for long-term incentive schemes.The Government will also have a say on the appointment of new independent non-executive directors and on dividend policy.Banks have also been told to commit to offer competitively-priced lending to homeowners and to small businesses. They will also offer support for schemes to help people struggling with mortgage payments to stay in their homes.Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.
