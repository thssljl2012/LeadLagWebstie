LONDON (AFP) - Barclays, one of Britain's leading banks, said Monday it planned to raise more than 6.5 billion pounds (8.19 billion euros, 11.13 billion dollars) from investors, turning down the offer of government help. 'Given the strength of Barclays' well-diversified business and the existing capital base, the board expects that the additional capital will be raised from investors without calling on the government funding which has been offered,' Barclays said in a statement.News of Barclay's independent fund-raising efforts comes as the British government announced plans to invest up to 37 billion pounds (47 billion euros, 64 billion dollars) in ailing British banks Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS and Lloyds TSB.Government representatives could be installed on their boards in a move so unprecedented that trading in banks on the London stock market could be suspended to allow traders to digest the news, newspapers reported.It would be the first implementation of a rescue package for banks announced last week, in which the government made available 50 billion pounds (64 billion euros, 87 billion dollars) to inject cash into banks in return for shares.Top
