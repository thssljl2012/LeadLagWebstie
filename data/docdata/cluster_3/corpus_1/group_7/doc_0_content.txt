Tucker rumoured to be readying a $5bn-$10bn proposal, and possibly a rights issue.  Rumours of Prudential's interest in buying Asian assets from AIG were repeated again on Sunday, in a report by British newspaper The Observer.The newspaper cites unnamed City of London sources as saying that Prudential, led by Mark Tucker, would spend between $5bn and $10bn on several of AIG's large operations in Asia.  AIG's huge Asian insurance business is said to be worth around $20bn.The report suggests that Prudential could link with another potential bidder, possibly Prudential Life of the US, given the expense of the transaction.   A rights issue by Prudential would also be on the cards.  Prudential already gains a third of its profits from Asia, and the acquisition would leapfrog its progress there.
