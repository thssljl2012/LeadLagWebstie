 Tower Australia Ltd said the loss of corporate customer St George Bank Ltd would reduce its $700 million book of business by eight per cent and have a 'part impact' on its 2009 profit.St George announced on Monday it had appointed AIG Life as its new life insurance partner, meaning that it would replace Tower as the provider of group life cover to the bank's funds manager Asgard. 'Assuming no other business changes, the loss of the Asgard business would have around a $60 million impact, or approximately eight per cent, on Tower Australia's $700 million in-force book,' Tower said. An annualised contribution margin impact of up to $4 million would be partly mitigated by related cost reductions in fiscal 2009 and the addition of new business, Tower added. 'There will be no profit impact in the 2008 year and a part impact in the 2009 year depending on when the transition takes place.' Tower shares lost 16 cents, or 5.59 per cent, to end at $2.70.While disappointing, Tower said the move by St George was not unexpected.The bank had decided to select a single partner model for its bank channel and group business and Tower did not have the bank channel expertise, Tower said.
