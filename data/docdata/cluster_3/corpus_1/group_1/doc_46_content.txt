 ONLY eight months after a management overhaul, junior telecoms group Commander Communications has been placed in receivership as its bankers race to recoup more than $300 million that was poured into the group.The move ends 12 months of uncertainty around the former Telstra subsidiary, including a failed sale of the business and the sacking of its senior management team last December.Hours after the group's board tipped Commander into voluntary administration on Thursday night Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and National Australia Bank called in receivers McGrathNicol to take control of the company's assets and data-to-day operations. But the banks are unlikely to recoup their investment from Commander's largely hollowed-out assets, according to Ferrier Hodgson partner Max Donnelly.'It appears the bank's debt will not be paid from the sale of the assets,' said Mr Donnelly, who acts for the administrator.'The banks will suffer a substantial deficiency and therefore there's no chance of creditors getting a dividend. Hence shareholders will not have any likelihood of a return.'Uncertainty hangs over Commander's 1300 employees who were briefed by the receivers yesterday where employee entitlements weren't guaranteed.In an internal email obtained by The Australian, CEO Amanda Lacaze told staff that Commander had been negotiating its debt facility with its banks over the past three months.Ms Lacaze, a former AOL-7 chief executive, took over last year after Adrian Coote resigned as Commander's problems mounted. Mr Coote was replaced by one-time AOL-7 chief executive Amanda Lacaze and former Telstra executive Shane AllanEarlier this year, Commander's debt blew out to $335 million but Ms Lacaze convinced the banks to delay a $115 million repayment due on October 31 this year until 2009 on the condition it executed on a company restructure. But Commander could not complete a planned asset sale and slashed its profit guidance by over $15 million to about $4 million, and more recently faced retrenching up to 120 staff after being forced to relocate its call centre operations to Adelaide.The restructure was prompted by the plunge in its share price last year from $2.75 to 20c and the management clean-out at the end of the year.McGrathNicol said it would continue to trade Commander on a ''business as usual basis'' whilst sales of the various businesses are pursued. ''There are no plans for major structural changes to the business while the sale process is underway,'' McGrathNicol partner Peter Anderson said.The first creditors' meeting will be held on Tuesday, August 19.Ms Lacaze wrote that the executive team 'right up until yesterday morning' were 'still hopeful that we could craft a solution that would meet with the approval of the banks'.The board recently voted to retain Ms Lacaze as CEO to the tune of $750,000 a year, with a retention bonus of $375,000 to be paid on September 1.She that Commander's board and management, had failed to execute on its restructure plan initiated at the start of the year. 'Time was against us -- despite everyone's best efforts we just couldn't get enough of the turnaround happening fast enough.'But we did give it a RED HOT GO! I did also say that whilst there were no guarantees of success, that you had my 100 per cent commitment and that of the whole executive team, that if we didn't get there it wouldn't be from lack of hard work.'Commander's customers include the Department of Finance and Deregulation, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, and over 30,000 small to medium businesses.
