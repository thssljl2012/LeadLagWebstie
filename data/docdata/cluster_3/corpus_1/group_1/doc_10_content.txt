 The battle between EnCap Golf and Wachovia Bank over $42 million is headed for a U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing next week, with an EnCap attorney claiming that Wachovia shouldn't be allowed to take its marbles and go home.At stake is the remaining portion of a $107 million state Environmental Infrastructure Trust bond issued in 2005. The bonds were designed to help pay for cleanup of the Lyndhurst and Rutherford landfills to make way for the EnCap golf and housing project.Wachovia officials estimated that EnCap owes the bank and its partners a total of $155 million, and the bank secured payment of the EIT bonds by letters of credit. EnCap acknowledges defaulting on its Wachovia obligations in September, due in part to what it called well-documented cost overruns. The state pulled the plug on the plan in May, and EnCap filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a day later.But EnCap attorney Michael Sirota insisted in papers filed Friday that the dormant company retains the right to the remaining EIT funds. Sirota painted Wachovia as the sole holdout in a reorganization process, engaging in a go for broke attempt to seize the $42 million.The state Meadowlands Commission and Department of Environmental Protection  as well as AIG insurance affiliates  have been cooperative since the bankruptcy filing, according to Sirota, after virtually no productive dialogue for several months.EnCap has informed the court that the company is now focusing on ensuring that cleanup plans continue uninterrupted, followed by a second phase of fielding proposals from developers, Sirota wrote.Wachovia attorneys have cited bad faith by EnCap for filing for bankruptcy while the bank was seeking to foreclose on the landfill property. But Sirota countered that the foreclosure attempt would have lasted several months or more anyway, and that the bankrupcty filing came in direct response to the states actions.EnCap won a round in court last week when bankruptcy judge Novalyn Winfield denied Mactecs bid to seek up to $35 million from an EnCap-related Lexington insurance policy. Winfield found that the 2005 policy is a valuable property interest of EnCap, one that at this point cannot be subject to the arbitration process.Both the Lexington policy and the disputed EIT money are part of what EnCap officials say is a collection of assets that, in total, would be sufficient to complete the remaining $125 million of environmental cleanup at the landfills.
