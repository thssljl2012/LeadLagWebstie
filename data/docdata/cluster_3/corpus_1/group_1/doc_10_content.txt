 'The Review Committee found weaknesses in the management and oversight of the Equity Finance business within ANZ's Securities Lending unit,' ANZ Chief Executive Mike Smith said in a statement. 'Taken together, this meant that ANZ did not adequately identify and manage the range of risks which arose from the operation of a business of this nature,' said Smith, who spearheaded the review. 'In reviewing this issue, it's clear the findings have some wider implications for ANZ's management of other nontraditional businesses, particularly in our Institutional Division,' he said. ANZ said Peter Hodgson, who headed the group's institutional division, will leave the bank immediately, with the ANZ's Asia head Alex Thursby to act in the role while an executive search is undertaken for a permanent replacement. The group also said Chris Page will be its new Chief Risk Officer, replacing David Stephen. -By Lyndal McFarland, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-8235-2957; lyndal.mcfarland@dowjones.com Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=msysc34sJNryHXUKmt4ODQ%3D%3D.
