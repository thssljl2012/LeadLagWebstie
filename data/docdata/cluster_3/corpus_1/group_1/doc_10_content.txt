 The Commonwealth Bank has rejected suggestions it could cut interest rates because the cost of funding its loans has fallen.An Assistant Reserve Bank Governor, Philip Lowe, says the 90-day bank bill rate has fallen considerably in recent weeks.He says that means the retail banks' cost of short-term funding has dropped significantly.But Commonwealth Bank's chief executive Ralph Norris says it relies on more than just the 90-day bank bill rate to calculate its interest rates. 'It's a basket of instruments that we use to assess the overall cost of funding and so to rely on one particular benchmark doesn't give the total picture, so certainly it has an impact and certainly as I said we will be doing our best to provide the best possible rate that we can,' he said. Today the Commonwealth Bank announced it made $4.8 billion in profit after tax in the 2008 financial year, which is 7 per cent more than the year before. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has used the latest bank profit statement to argue any drop in official interest rates must be passed on to customers.Mr Rudd has repeated his warning to the major banks that if the Reserve Bank downgrades the official cash rate they should do the same. He says it is the right and reasonable thing to do. 'If you're registering in these economic circumstances a 7 per cent increase in profits, I would say that those banks owe it to working Australians who are under financial pressure at the moment, that when official interest rates move that those moves should be passed on to consumers,' he said.
