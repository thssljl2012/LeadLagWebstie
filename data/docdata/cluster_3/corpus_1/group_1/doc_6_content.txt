 St George Bank has announced it has appointed AIG Life as its new life insurance partner. As part of the new alliance, AIG Life will become the new provider of group life insurance cover for Asgard, St George's superannuation and platform unit, replacing Tower. A Tower spokesperson said the company was disappointed to be replaced by AIG, and the decision would cut by eight per cent its in-force premiums book, worth $A700 million
