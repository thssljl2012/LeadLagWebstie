 Australian non-bank mortgage lender Resimac said it has set up a type of credit line for its prime residential mortgage backed securities with National Australia Bank. The facility, also called a warehouse, does not have a fixed size yet but is expected to be either $750 million Australian dollars ($US685.6 million) or $1 billion. This is the third such facility for Resimac which has a $1 billion warehouse with Deutsche Bank and another $800 million with Barclays Capital. Warehouses allow non-bank lenders to access funding from banks. However with the global credit crunch, some banks have been reluctant to open or renew such credit lines, in particular when they involve mortgages. Resimac's new warehouse is called Resimac Triomphe Trust Warehouse Series No.1.
