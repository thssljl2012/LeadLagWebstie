 The extent of the $1.7 billion loss defines Allco as one of this region's hardest hit casualties of the credit crunch. Even after more radical surgery the outlook is fragile, writes Stuart Kelly.TROUBLED finance house Allco Finance Group has reported a massive loss and says it will restructure to focus on its core capabilities by selling non-core assets, firing staff and exiting some businesses.The Sydney-based manager of ships and aircraft posted a net loss of $1.73 billion for the year ended June 30 and said its business remained in a fragile position amid weakness in investment markets.Allco is among Australia's biggest casualties of the global credit contraction that's forced Babcock &amp;amp; Brown and Centro Properties Group to sell assets to cut debt. Allco said it will fire half its workforce and sell assets as it aims to reduce debt by more than half from A$1.04 billion in the last half.'It's on life support as the banks try to rescue their loans,' said Matthew Kidman, who helps manage the equivalent of $350 million at Wilson Asset Management.'Allco has been one of the most visible Australian casualties of the credit crisis so far.'Allco Chief Executive David Clarke said Allco would radically change its business model to focus on its core investment capabilities in the aviation, shipping and private equity markets.'This new business model means Allco will be a fiduciary manager of investment funds in aviation, shipping and private equity,' he said.'We will cease our principal investment activities, sell remaining non-core assets, and in the future only use the balance sheet to co-invest in our managed funds.'The result reflects impairment charges of $1.43 billion, including writedowns of investments, and losses on the sale of some assets.The bottom line result was higher than the company's guidance in May for a loss of more than $1.5 billion. Its normalised net profit was $29.2 million.'This new structure is a major departure from our previous operations in which the group was heavily reliant on debt and as a result was exposed to the global credit crisis and deteriorating financial markets.'With its previous complex structure, Allco had entered some non-core businesses that were dependent on the ongoing availability of corporate funding.'Mr Clarke said the decision to exit those businesses was clear. 'They were either unprofitable in the new economic environment or required significant capital to achieve profitable scale,' he said.'We have determined that capital is better deployed in our three core asset classes, which fit our funds management model.'Allco has been forced to sell assets such as the Tehachapi wind power project in California and its Singapore real estate unit. The company's Mobius unit stopped accepting new home loans in February.The divestments have allowed it to cut its corporate debt to $704 million as at August 25, from $1.041 billion in June. Bankers including ABN Amro Holding NV, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank last month waived the right to recall loans early after Allco agreed to higher interest rates.But Mr Clarke warned there will be further job losses as Allco cuts its operating costs.Allco expects to sack up to half of its staff and sell assets worth more than $300 million before June 2009.
