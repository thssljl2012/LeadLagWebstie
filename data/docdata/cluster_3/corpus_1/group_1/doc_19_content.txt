 Individual Restaurant Company (IRC), owner of the Piccolino and The Restaurant, Bar and Grill brands, has announced plans to launch a further seven UK sites in 2009, after securing a revolving credit facility of 18.5m from Lloyds TSB.Defying warnings of expansion during the credit crunch, IRC have already announced plans for six Piccolino restaurants for 2008 in Aberdeen, Bristol, Hale and Clitheroe (sites in York and Aberdeen have already opened), and also a Restaurant, Bar and Grill in Harrogate.Vernon Lord, Finance Director of IRC, says: We have a really strong pipeline, with dozens of opportunities across the UK. But we are not rolling out chain restaurants. We are expanding in strategic sites, creating individual restaurants that are raising the bar in terms of standards and quality.IRC currently employs 1200 people across 30 restaurants nationwide, and although as yet the seven sites pinned for development in 2009 have not been named, the company is sure to create hundreds of new jobs for hospitality workers across the country.
