 In this uncertain environment it is important to emphasise the huge difference between finance companies and banks, particularly in New Zealand.The failure of more than 20 finance companies, which is a dreadful reflection on the poor governance and lack of regulation of this sector, doesn't signal that any of the country's 17 banks are in trouble.Our banks are subject to Reserve Bank supervision and are required to have a high level of disclosure, whereas there is no effective supervision of finance companies and their disclosure has been woeful.Banks are subject to scrutiny by the major international credit rating agencies whereas there has been no requirement for finance companies to be rated.There are a huge number of banks around the world, including more than 7100 in the United States, and Standard &amp;amp; Poor's rates more than 2000 of these.The good news for New Zealand depositors is that the four largest domestic banks - ANZ National, ASB Bank,  and Westpac - are in an elite group of only 28 banks, out of the 2000 plus, that are rated AA or better.As the accompanying table shows seven of these 28 banks are based in Switzerland, five in the United Kingdom, four each in Australia and the United States, three in Spain, two in The Netherlands and one each in Luxembourg, France and Belgium.There are only five AAA rated banks - three Swiss private banks, Rabobank and Wells Fargo Bank. Rabobank, which is based in Utrecht, is the only AAA rated bank operating in New Zealand. None of the five banks with an AA+ rating, which is also New Zealand's sovereign rating, operate in this country.Six of the eighteen banks with an AA rating have New Zealand activities, the four largest Australian banks, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank and Citibank.New Zealand's major banks are given the same rating as their Australian parent because it is assumed that the parent will stand by them in case of distress although there are no formal guarantees that this will happen.The New Zealand operations could be given a lower rating than their Australian parents if Standard &amp;amp; Poor's decided the latter were no longer in a position to support their NZ operations. UDC Finance is the only other NZ financial institution with an AA rating because it is a fully owned subsidiary of ANZ National Bank. In simple terms an AAA rating means the highest rating and quality whereas AA indicates highest quality and a very strong capacity to meet financial commitments. The two other investment grades, A and BBB, signal favourable quality but with the potential for problems in adverse economic conditions. Ratings BB and below are non-investment grade and of speculative quality.
