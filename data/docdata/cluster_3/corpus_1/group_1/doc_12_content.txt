 THE Australian Securities Exchange Disciplinary Appeal Tribunal has dismissed an appeal by Lance Rosenberg's Tricom Futures and upheld a $50,000 fine against the Sydney securities lending firm.Yesterday's ruling upholds a decision by the ASX's business conduct committee in April, which found that Tricom Futures had contravened four Sydney Futures Exchange operating rules. Among the four contraventions were making withdrawals from a client segregated account (CSA) which were not permitted withdrawals in accordance with the operating rules, and using a CSA to meet Tricom Futures' house margin liabilities. The ruling comes at a sensitive time for Tricom, which is fighting for survival. The firm is locked in urgent talks with lender ANZ and stakeholders such as Babcock &amp;amp; Brown, after Danish bank Saxo pulled out of a $20 million deal to buy a 35 per cent stake. An announcement is expected shortly. Responding to the ASX decision, Tricom said that the matter related to an 'inadvertent back office procedural error' that occurred in April 2007 and resulted in the contravention of four Sydney Futures Exchange operating rules. Mr Rosenberg said that Tricom accepted the decision of the appeal tribunal and that responsibility for the error ultimately lay with him as managing director of the company. 'We take compliance with trading rules very seriously. After this error was identified in April 2007, we took immediate remedial action and there has been no recurrence,' he said. 'We underwent a thorough and rigorous process to improve our systems and ensure that our accounts are designated appropriately. 'This included compulsory compliance training for relevant staff and enhanced control and check measures.' Tricom appealed the matter on procedural grounds.
