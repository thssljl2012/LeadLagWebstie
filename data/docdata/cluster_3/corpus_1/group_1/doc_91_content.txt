 One of the country's biggest property developers - British Land - has announced a first quarter pre-tax loss of 572m. That compares to a 266m profit for the same time last year. The group, whose 13.5bn property portfolio includes offices and shopping centres, is struggling with falling property prices and lower retail sales. However, chairman Chris Gibson-Smith remains upbeat. 'These results demonstrate British Land's resilience in the face of a weak economy and gloomy market sentiment.' 'While values are marked down in a thin market, our prime assets - buildings and customer contracts - provide strength in difficult times. British Land reported it's first annual loss in more than 20 years in May after the value of its offices and shopping centres plummeted by 1.6bn. The company has sold 669m worth of assets this year as the economic slowdown continues to hit the UK property market. Henk Potts, Equity Strategist at Barclays said: ' The underlying profit is pretty bleak, clearly the value of its property portfolio has fallen.' 'The economic slowdown is starting to hit office rent rates and they are clearly nervous about the future.'
