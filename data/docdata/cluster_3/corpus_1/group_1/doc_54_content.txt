  By Katherine Griffiths, Financial Services EditorPrudential's shares may jump this week after it emerged that China's central bank has built up a shareholding of about 1pc in the insurer.The People's Bank of China (PBC) has bought the stake in the past few weeks via a nominee account. The investment, revealed by The Sunday Telegraph, makes the PBC one of Prudential's largest shareholders.The move is thought to be part of China's broader drive to invest its foreign currency reserves rather than as the opening salvo in a takeover approach to Prudential.However, news of the stake may reignite the debate among analysts and investors about whether Prudential should spin off its fast-growing Asian arm into a company that would attract a higher rating.Mark Tucker, Prudential's chief executive since May 2006, has made it one of his priorities to boost the company's share price by getting investors more fully to recognise the value of the Asia business, which is the second-biggest foreign-owned business in the region after American International Group of the US.Following speculation earlier this year that a large Chinese insurer might take a stake in Prudential, Mr Tucker said: 'We always welcome long-term shareholders. We talk to a number of different shareholders.' Mr Tucker, who fought off a takeover proposal from UK rival Aviva in 2006, has resisted a break up of Prudential.Shareholders have been vocal in the past about a potential break-up. They may see the stakebuilding by the PBC as an opportunity to raise the subject again.The Chinese bank is also understood to have been buying shares in other insurers that have been hit by the turbulence in world markets. Legal &amp;amp; General and Old Mutual are believed to be among the bank's targets.Other Chinese investors in the UK include China Development Bank, which has become one of Barclays' largest shareholders, having taken part in two fundraisings for the British lender in the past year.Meanwhile, Prudential is understood to be examining potential bolt-on acquisitions that would enable it to take advantage of the weakened state of some competitors.
