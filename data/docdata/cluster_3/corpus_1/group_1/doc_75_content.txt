 LONDON (Reuters) - Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley is set to appoint Richard Pym, former head of rival mortgage bank Alliance &amp;amp; Leicester , as its chief executive, a source close to the situation said on Sunday.The appointment, which could be announced as early as Monday, brings an end to the months-long search for a replacement for Steven Crawshaw, who left his position as B&amp;amp;B's chief executive in June for health reasons, as the embattled lender struggled to push through an emergency cash call. B&amp;amp;B hopes the arrival of well-regarded City veteran Pym, who stepped down from his position as A&amp;amp;L chief executive last year, will draw a line under a string of troubles and a tough few months for the largest buy-to-let mortgage lender. Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley declined to comment.The bank is separately looking for a replacement for Chairman Rod Kent, who took on an executive role after Crawshaw's departure, but has indicated he is ready to leave.The lender, forced to turn to shareholders earlier this year in the face of a rapidly deteriorating UK economy, is separately due to publish the outcome of its twice-restructured, cut-price 400 million pounds rights issue on Monday.A source familiar with the matter said take-up would be 'comfortably above 20 percent', after B&amp;amp;B shares traded just ahead of the 55p rights price as the deadline for subscriptions closed on Friday.The bank, which follows rivals including Royal Bank of Scotland in turning to shareholders for cash, had been expected to exceed the paltry 8 percent level seen at HBOS , where shares closed below the rights issue price ahead of a 4 billion pound rights issue.Retail investors, which make up 40 percent of the B&amp;amp;B total investor base, are not expected to have taken up their rights, but underwriting and sub-underwriting deals should protect B&amp;amp;B. Underwriters Citi and UBS said in July they would stand by the plan despite a rating downgrade which prompted private equity group TPG to pull out from buying a stake. TPG had been brought in just weeks earlier, when B&amp;amp;B slashed its rights issue price as trading conditions deteriorated.The two investment banks are expected to take on up to 100 million pounds of the rights issue, which will total around 455 million including fees. The remainder will be passed on through sub-underwriting agreements to four top shareholders and to six clearing banks -- spreading the cost of propping up the country's largest buy-to-let lender over 12 institutions.The four shareholders -- Standard Life, Legal &amp;amp; General, Prudential's M&amp;amp;G and Insight -- could take on up to 150 million pounds of the total, while the banks will take on the remainder, up to 200 million or as much as 3 percent each.That could leave HSBC , Lloyds TSB , HBOS, Barclays , Santander's Abbey and Royal Bank of Scotland with just under 20 percent of the enlarged share base.(Reporting by Clara Ferreira-Marques and Marc Roca; Editing by Rory Channing)
