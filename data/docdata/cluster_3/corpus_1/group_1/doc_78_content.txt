Mainstreams chairman, Fintan Drury said: Our plan is to go to investors with a series of commercial opportunities later this year and raise enough equity to develop them. Mark Brown, head of Barclays Capital commodities principal investment team, has joined Mainstreams board as part of the deal.The investment is set to help fund the companys expansion plans across Europe, the Americas and Australia, including an initial pipeline of 240MW wind projects in Chile with local partner Andes Energy. The funds will also be used to secure a supply of turbines in 2009, 2010 and 2011. With initial seed capital of 32 million, the investment brings Mainstreams total equity to 72 million, taking Mainstream closer to its September investment target of 200 million announced in June this year. Mainstream was founded in February of this year by OConnor, following his departure from Irish wind energy developer Airtricity, where he led the companys sale for 1.8 billion last year and in January to utilities E.ON and Scottish &amp;amp; Southern Energy.
