 Sovereign wealth fund Temasek has said it wants to lift its stake in Merrill Lynch despite the sharp fall in the bank's share price.The state-owned fund became the largest shareholder in Merrill Lynch in December, when it paid $4.9bn (2.7bn) for a 9pc stake as part of the investment bank's recapitalisation. Merrill's shares have since lost half their value.The struggling Wall Street bank had to raise more cash in July, when Temasek invested a further $3.4bn.Michael Dee, Temasek's senior managing director at Temasek, told Bloomberg that Merrill had 'a great franchise which has existed through many crisies through a long period of time.' Temasek wants to raise its stake in Merrill to between 13pc and 14pc.Temasek also warned yesterday that the global economic slowdown caused by the credit crisis could continue for two years and said the risk of 'stagflation' could have a sweeping impact on society.The state-owned fund's comments came as it unveiled a doubling in full-year profits, achieved despite sharp falls in the share price of major investments such as Merrill Lynch and Barclays. The value of its fund grew from 59bn to 73bn. Temasek insisted the investments held promise because they were 'turnaround champions for future growth'.The fund yesterday unveiled net profits of 6.9bn for the year to March 31, boosted by the tripling of asset sales, including the disposal of Singapore's biggest power plant. Temasek also doubled new investments to 12.2bn.An anti-dilution agreement that Temasek negotiated with Merrill meant the US bank had to compensate the Singaporean fund for the loss on its shares in the intervening period by paying $2.5bn. This meant that just $900m of the second capital injection by Temasek was new money.Temasek has also invested 975m in Barclays and raised its stake in Standard Chartered to 19pc, making it the largest shareholder in the emerging markets bank.Temasek predicted that there would be more opportunities for investment in the coming year, but its chairman, S Dhanabalan, warned that there were also threats.'The fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months, with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations,' he said.He added that Temasek was worried about risks from stagflation - a combination of high inflation and slowing growth. 'This presents huge socio-political as well as economic risks in the next three to five years. Opportunities may be limited in such a scenario,' he said.Temasek also disclosed that it received a 3.8bn capital injection last year from Singapore's finance ministry, its sole shareholder.Trackback      Tags: deflation      Category:  Commentary     ShareShare this article:Temasek also warned yesterday that the global economic slowdown caused by the credit crisis could continue for two years and said the risk of 'stagflation' could have a sweeping impact on society.The state-owned fund's comments came as it unveiled a doubling in full-year profits, achieved despite sharp falls in the share price of major investments such as Merrill Lynch and Barclays.
