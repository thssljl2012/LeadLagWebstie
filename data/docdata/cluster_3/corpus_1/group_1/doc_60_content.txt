 Moustaches will be in vogue this September  lawyers included  if you are connected to the private equity world and want to raise money for charity. The Everyman male cancer campaign launched TacheBack last week by sticking fake moustaches on four of its high-profile participants  but the challenge is to grow a real tache during September in return for sponsorship cash.The Everyman campaign, run by The Institute of Cancer Research, is hoping to raise 300,000 to help raise awareness of, and funds for, research into testicular and prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is now the most common cancer in men, affecting 35,000 and killing one every hour.To contribute, email private-equity@icr.ac.uk or call 0800 731 9468 for an information pack.Pictured above are: Alan Greenberg, managing partner of Invex Capital LLP; Tom Lamb, managing director of Barclays Private Equity; Jeremy Hand, chairman of the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association; and Wol Kolade, managing partner of ISIS Equity.
