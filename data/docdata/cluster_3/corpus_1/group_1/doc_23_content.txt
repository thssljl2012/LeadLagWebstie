 AUSTRALIA'S banks rushed to the capital markets to sell bonds this week to take advantage of a flood of maturing debt, but the burst of issuance probably will not continue in coming weeks, analysts say.An aggressive fundraising drive during the first half of the year, coupled with access to offshore markets, means Australia's banks could shy away from the domestic market in the coming months, narrowing already tight supply. Also, a continuing global credit crunch will push non-financial corporates towards the cheaper option of securing financing through bank loans, rather than issuing bonds. Sales of corporate bonds in Australia this year have been wholly restricted to banks. More than $2 billion of bank debt sold this week, outstripping $1.1 billion sold in all of July, underscoring firm investor appetite for Australia's financials. 'It's probably a bit of a blip,' said Michael Bush, National Australia Bank's head of fixed-income credit research. A large amount of maturing debt prompted issuers to appeal to investors that had spare cash. About $10 billion of government, corporate, state and supranational debt matured on Friday alone, including the last remaining Australian dollar bond sold by BHP Billiton in the public market. The traditional August holiday in the northern hemisphere also contributed to this week's rush, spurring domestic banks to look towards the local market rather than foreign investors, Bush said. ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and HBOS all raised funds in recent days, but US financial sector woes mean credit markets are probably some way from a full recovery.Dow Jones Newswires
