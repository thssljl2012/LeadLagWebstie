 A review of ANZ Banking Group's securities lending operations has found risk controls were inadequate in the period leading up to the Opes Prime crisis and that some employees breached the bank's code of conduct.ANZ said on Friday that a string of employees had left or would leave the bank and others would be disciplined.ANZ said it had developed a 13 point 'remediation' plan to rectify the problems uncovered by the review. 'It's clear the findings have some wider implications for ANZ's management of other non-traditional businesses, particularly in our Institutional Division,' ANZ said in a statement on Friday to the Australian stock exchange.
