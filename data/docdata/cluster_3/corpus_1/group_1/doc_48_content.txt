 National Australia Bank (NAB) in late July 2008 revealed it had to set aside a surprise $A830m to make provisions for bad debts. Rival Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) says the news from NAB caused offshore investors to become wary of the Australian banking sector, and as a result CBA decided to no longer pursue the acquisition of the Australian operations of ABN Amro. It had already sourced $A1.6bn, but faced higher costs. The situation then deteriorated even further, with ANZ Banking's unveiling of its write-offs worth $A1.4bn. ABN will now remain with Royal Bank of Scotland
