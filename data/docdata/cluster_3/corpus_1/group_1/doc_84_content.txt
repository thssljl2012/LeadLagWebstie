 National Australia Bank chairman Michael Chaney says he hopes the bank has not lost credibility after the turbulence of the past week.The bank announced the resignation of its chief executive officer on the back of revealing it would have to write-off about $1 billion in bad debts related to US mortgage securities.Mr Chaney has told ABC1's Inside Business, the losses the bank has suffered in recent years should not taint its standing. 'We're not like the other Australian banks in the sense that we are much more international, we've got operations not only in the US and that capital but in the UK and New Zealand,' he said. 'And there are times when that's a great advantage and other times when it's been a disadvantage, but the bank's in very strong health. 'We're well capitalised and we're excited about the future.'
