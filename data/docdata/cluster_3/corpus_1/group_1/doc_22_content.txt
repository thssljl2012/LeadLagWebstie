  Royal Bank of Scotland shareholders have demanded further boardroom changes after the appointment of three new non-executive directors to bolster governance at the bank, as revealed yesterday by The Daily Telegraph.Despite approving the trio of respected industry figures, which included British Land chief executive Stephen Hester, investors said a deeper shake-up was necessary to improve boardroom independence following the lender's record 12bn emergency rights issue earlier this year.Guy Jubb, head of corporate governance at Standard Life, said: 'These changes demonstrate that the RBS board is getting to grips with its governance.' Other shareholders, speaking anonymously, added that chairman Sir Tom McKillop remains under threat. 'Confidence in him is very low, largely as he was saying everything is wonderful before the crisis,' one said. In April, just months after insisting that its capital position was sustainable, RBS launched the largest rights issue in European history after unveiling 5.9bn of credit market write-downs.Shareholders said that if Sir Tom was to step down, Mr Hester, 47, who was previously chief operating officer and finance director at Abbey National and before that a banker for 19 years at Credit Suisse, would expect to be considered for the post.However, investors indicated they do not judge him to be sufficiently heavyweight yet. Instead, sources said he may be groomed as a potential successor in two years' time if Sir Tom wins over enough disgruntled shareholders to last that long.Mr Hester is resigning as deputy chairman of Northern Rock to take up the post.He will be joined by John McFarlane, of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, who retired last year after 10 years as chief executive, and Arthur Ryan, a former chairman of Prudential Financial in the US.Mr McFarlane brings the Asian banking experience that RBS wanted. Mr Ryan will replace Larry Fish and Charles Koch, who are both retiring next April, as RBS's main US representative on the board.The appointments will inject fresh independence into the board but more is expected. Bob Scott, the senior independent director, has indicated his intention to step down next year and Sir Tom is said to be continuing the search for a replacement.
