 THERE'S been lots of gloom and doom about job losses hitting the headlines lately.Barclays, for instance, said it expects the market conditions over the foreseeable future to remain tough and that it will be carrying out a strategic plan to tightly control resources, which will include a sharper focus on IT spending.Following a profit slump of 33 per cent drop for its half-year results, the bank is on an austerity drive. Its cost-control strategy involves reducing numbers of IT contractors and temps and offshoring 1,800 technology jobs over the next two years  700 positions will be transferred by this September.But don't expect this trend to become pervasive across the IT industry any time soon.In fact, a study recently published by recruitment company, The IT Job Board, shows that the number of IT-testing roles increased by 8.3 per cent in the year's second quarter and developer positions also increased slightly.This mirrors my own company's experience, we've been continuing to recruit and expand our teams.Similarly Computer Weekly, one of the most authoritative industry journals, has recently published the view that 'the IT industry is continuing to avoid the hard times'.Their view is that IT investment is now central to many companies efforts to improve productivity long term.Even the Barclays' example is more about moving jobs offshore rather than removing them completely.From the point of view of an individual, job security is mainly determined by the performance of their own employer rather than the industry as a whole.So while the IT sector as a whole is holding up well we need to remember that to keep it that way we need to be generating real business benefits to our employers or clients rather than simply being an avoidable cost.Chris Gledhill is the managing director of Manx-based software company PDMS Limited.
