 DUBAI: Two Gulf Arab sovereign wealth funds are looking to borrow as much as $6.5bn to help finance expansion, bankers said yesterday.Bahrains $10bn investment agency Mumtalakat Holdings is seeking $500mn to finance acquisitions and Investment Corp Dubai, which pools some of the emirates biggest firms, has started syndication of a $6bn loan, bankers said.Mumtalakat said in May it was considering two acquisitions, one in the services sector in North America worth as much as $1bn dollars, and another in Asia.It will close syndication of its loan on Aug 17, said a spokesman for the National Bank of Bahrain (NBB), which is arranging the loan. Mumtalakat owns 50% of NBB.The five-year loan, which includes a $150mn Islamic tranche, is being marketed to local and regional banks, he said.By undertaking our first debt facility, Mumtalakat will be well placed to capture value-creating acquisition opportunities when they arise, Mumtalakat chief executive Talal al-Zain said in a statement.Investment Corp Dubais loan, which is in general syndication, includes two Islamic tranches of $1.5bn to $2bn, two bankers involved in the transaction said on Tuesday.The loan will be used for general corporate activity, bankers said last month.Regional government investment agencies are tapping debt markets to finance expansion as Gulf economies boom on a more than five-fold rise in oil prices since 2002.Mumtalakat planned to sell assets and buy into foreign firms as part of a strategy by Bahrain to diversify holdings, Zain said in May.Mumtalakats assets include Bahrain Aluminium (Alba), Gulf Air, Bahrain Telecoms Co (Batelco) and a 30% stake in the Mclaren Formula 1 motor racing team.Royal Bank of Scotland, Standard Bank, Barclays Capital, Citigroup and HSBC are lead arrangers for the ICDs conventional loan, while Noor Islamic Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank and Standard Chartered are among the bookrunners for the Islamic tranches.
