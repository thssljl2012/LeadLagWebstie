 Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd is expected to reveal a modest two per cent rise in annual profit despite its efforts to offset higher funding costs by lifting interest rates.Earnings growth will be restrained as higher interbank borrowing costs continue to squeeze its margins, a slowing economy curbs demand for credit and a falling sharemarket hurts its wealth management arm.CBA is expected to report a 1.82 per cent increase in cash net profit for the 12 months to June 30 to $4.688 billion when it releases its results on Wednesday, according to mean estimates data compiled by Thomson Reuters.Australia's biggest bank by market value said in February that it hadn't fully passed on higher interbank funding costs to its customers, resulting in $100 million hole in its first half result.In February, the bank also reported some big single-name corporate bad loan exposures, such as to troubled supermarket owner Centro Properties Group Ltd.Analysts will be looking for any more corporate losses in the second half, particularly following recent shock write-down announcements from National Australian Bank Ltd and ANZ Banking Group Ltd.Merrill Lynch isn't expecting too many surprises on Wednesday given CBA's transparency around its solid lending volume growth and improving margins from re-pricing. 'The key negatives are likely to be CBA's relative equity market and general insurance leverage, relatively high expense growth and perceptions of relative under-provisioning,' Merrill Lynch said.Merrill Lynch noted that of the $6.5 billion in bad debt it expects the local banking sector to incur, $2,2 billion were associated with only a few one-off names. 'We therefore expect a heavy focus on CBA's outlook statements and new impaired build-up, specifically as they relate to core domestic asset quality.' Credit Suisse also expects a 'low surprise result' and says investors will be looking for asset quality trends, given the slowing economy.CBA chief executive Ralph Norris said as recently as last month that he expected the credit crunch to last for up to another two years.Mr Norris last month declined to guarantee that CBA would cut its interest rates if the official cash rate was cut.
