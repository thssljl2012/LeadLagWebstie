 Sir Fred Goodwin, chief executive of NatWest owner Royal Bank of Scotland is set to come under renewed pressure from investors this week as the bank is forecast to report the biggest-ever loss in UK banking history.Analysts predict that RBS will take another 6bn hit from the credit crunch, driving its first-half loss for the year to as much as 1.7bn. That would be as much as five times the amount Barclays lost in 1992 at the height of the last recession which was the previous record.
