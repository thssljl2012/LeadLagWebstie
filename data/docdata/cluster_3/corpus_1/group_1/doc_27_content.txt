 Australian-listed retailing conglomerate Woolworths has launched a new credit card product. In an alliance with card provider Mastercard and banking group HSBC, it will offer rewards points for purchases at any of the stores in its network of supermarkets, liquor stores, electronic goods shops and discount department stores. Michael Luscombe, the CEO, has signalled that Woolworths plans to further diversify into the personal finance market, after it has ended a restrictive agreement with Commonwealth Bank of Australia on its underperforming Ezybank concept. Insurance products may be added at a later stage
