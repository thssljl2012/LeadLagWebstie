Middle Eastern investors will pump up to 7.3 billion pounds ($17.8 billion) into Barclays, allowing the bank to strengthen its balance sheet without resorting to a bail-out by the British government.The capital increase announced today underscores Barclays' determination to retain its commercial independence, coming just weeks after its peers agreed to stringent trading and management conditions to borrow taxpayer funds.A trio of Middle Eastern investors - the Qatar Investment Authority, the Challenger investment vehicle led by the Qatari royal family and Sheik Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the Abu Dhabi royal family - could end up owning almost a third of the bank as a result of the deal.'There has been quite a significant shift in the availability of capital and economic power in the world over the past five years and we are ensuring that we are well aligned with those changes,'' chief executive John Varley said yesterday in a conference call.The stock market initially responded positively to the news, with Barclays' shares jumping more than 10%, but by midafternoon trading the stock had slumped 15% to 173.8 pence.Collins Stewart analyst Alex Potter said that the cost of the new capital is 'commensurately high,'' estimating the equity to be costing over 16% in year one, including fees and commissions.Mr Potter said that Barclays was trading at too rich a premium to RBS and LLoyds 'especially while questions remain over its gearing to both capital markets earnings and potential further write-downs.''Barclays, Britain's third largest bank, needed to raise funds to meet new capital reserve requirements set out by the British government for banks as part of its 50 billion pounds package earlier this month.The Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and HBOS all received direct funding in the bailout, ceding major stakes to the government and halting cash bonuses for board members this year in return for the rescue.Barclays and HSBC Bank decided not to seek a government handout, with Barclays flagging up the deal announced Friday, while HSBC Bank received a 750 million pound injection from HSBC Holdings, its international parent company.Mr Varley said the deal with the Middle Eastern investors, which must be approved by shareholders, was a ''forward-looking and progressive approach to managing the share register'' that made Barclays one of the strongest banks in the world in capital terms.'We have what we need,'' he said, when asked if the bank would need to raise further funds in the future.In a trading update alongside the announcement of the capital raising, Barclays said third quarter pretax profits were 'slightly ahead'' of the previous year.The bank, which bought the US investment banking arm of collapsed Lehman Brothers last month, recorded credit market writedowns of 1.2 billion pounds but the charge was mostly offset by 1.1 billion pounds in gains on the fair valuation of issued notes.Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said Barclays 'continues to underline management's strength in outflanking its rivals,'' adding that the recent cherry picking of Lehman assets 'so far appears to have been a shrewd move.''But he also sounded a word of caution for the banking sector as a whole, noting that the 'road ahead still looks long and steep.'''A relatively deep global recession could require further capital raising, with banks on this occasion going into a downturn in relatively poor shape,'' he added.The new capital raising will comprise 3 billion pounds of reserve capital instruments, with an associated issue of warrants, and an issue of up to 4.3 billion pounds of mandatorily convertible notes.Mr Varley said the funding injection would lift the bank's Tier One capital ratio to 11.3%, from 9%, as at June 30, 2008. The proforma equity ratio would rise to 7.6% from 6%.He added that the deal fits with Barclays' strategy of seeking investments from institutions with which it can potentially do business in the long term.In July, it raised 4.5 billion pounds from the Qatar Investment Authority and Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.It has also received funds from the China Development Bank and Temasek Holdings, based in Singapore.Challenger, the company representing Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabr Al-Thani, the chairman of Qatar Holding, is also already an investor.The deal also extends Sheikh Mansour's investments in Britain after he bought Manchester City, a football team in the Barclays sponsored Premier League, in September.
