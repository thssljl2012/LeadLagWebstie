BARCLAYS is increasingly confident it has seen off a major shareholder revolt and will get the go-ahead for a 7billion fundraising that will leave the bank one-third owned by Middle Eastern investors.  The bank believes it is likely to secure the 75 per cent vote needed to pass the fundraising at an extraordinary meeting on November 24 after a meeting with influential investor representative group the Association of British insurers.  As a result, the ABi said it was considering putting an amber rating on the deal pending further talks with the bank.   An amber rating is a sign there are concerns, but not enough to recommend members vote against.   Barclays investors have protested against the fund- raising because it gives too much power to investors from Qatar and Abu Dhabi, heavily dilutes their holdings and is too expensive. The ABi said: The cost of the proposed funding package is substantial and, in the opinion of some share holders, is unfavourable to the terms offered to other UK banks by HM treasury.
