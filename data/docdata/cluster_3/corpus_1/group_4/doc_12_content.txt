The Treasury may allow leading shareholders in the banks to take a slice of the most profitable part of its bail-out scheme in an attempt to keep the taxpayers' bill to a minimum.  City institutions and other big shareholders could be allowed access to the highly profitable preference shares being bought by the Treasury, say Whitehall sources.  Allowing City firms access to the preference shares, which will pay a generous 12 per cent a year, is being considered as a way to encourage them to buy billions of pounds of new shares in the banks and so save the Treasury from having to take huge stakes.  Profitable preference: Giving City firms access to preference shares will hopefully minimise the expense to taxpayers  In the bail-out unveiled by the Government last month, the Treasury is underwriting multi-billion pound rights issues by Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS and Lloyds TSB, but will itself take 9billion in preference-shares. But Treasury sources confirmed it may give City investors access to those shares if they agreed to take up their rights to the new ordinary shares.  If existing investors do not take part, the Government, as underwriter for the scheme, could be left owning 43.5 per cent of the merged HBOS-Lloyds TSB and almost 60 per cent of RBS.  Treasury sources said it was an option if Ministers decided it would 'help increase financial stability'. They suggested the preference shares could be released to wider investors through UK Financial Investments (UKFI), the company it was setting up to manage nationalised Northern Rock and Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley and any other stakes it buys in the banks. It is likely the preference shares would not be released directly, but that UKFI could issue separate investment instruments that would match the preference share terms.  These shares have been a bone of contention because of the Government's ruling that as long as they are outstanding, the banks cannot pay any dividends to ordinary shareholders, a fact likely to discourage those shareholders from adding to their investments through the rights issues.  The first of the rights issues will be from RBS, which will hold its shareholder meeting to approve the plan this week.  Meanwhile, Barclays is this weekend still in discussions with shareholders over its plans to raise 7.3billion by selling just over 30 per cent of its business to Qatar's sovereign wealth fund and a member of the Abu Dhabi Royal family.  Its deal also involves selling high-yielding instruments to the Gulf investors, which has enraged the bank's existing shareholders, including Legal &amp;amp; General, which have reportedly threatened to vote against the plan.  The Association of British Insurers is planning to issue an 'amber top' report on Barclays, which means it will advise investors to abstain on the vote. However, it is understood that report has not been finalised and Barclays is hoping to convince the ABI to withdraw its objections.
