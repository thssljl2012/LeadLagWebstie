Royal Bank of Scotland is on course to record its first- ever annual loss after being swamped by toxic asset writedowns, including a 1billion hit from its exposure to Lehman Brothers and Iceland.  The stricken lender reported a smaller than expected markdown of 206million on bad loans in the third quarter. Under previous accounting rules this would have been 1.4billion.  RBS insisted adoption of the new accounting standard brings it into line with its international banking rivals such as Barclays.  Incoming chief executive Stephen Hester said the latest charges, which come on top of the 5.9billion taken in the first half, clearly shows the bank took on too many risky investments and will drive it into the red this year.  Bad news: RBS is tipped to record its first loss  Analysts estimate RBS will make a 228million loss for the year. In 2007 pre-tax profits were 9.9billion.  Hester said: 'We all have to accept that, partly because of the market disruption and economic downturn, all financial institutions will be in a period of rising credit losses. All businesses in all banks will exhibit these stresses because our customers are under pressure.'  As the economy has stalled, unemployment is on the rise, and more people are defaulting on their loan repayments, putting all banks under the spotlight.  RBS demonstrated this, saying loans in danger of defaulting rose across all divisions in the first nine months. They represented 1.7 per cent of the bank's total loans at the end of September, up from 1.5 per cent at the half-year point.  The quality of the bank's debt also deteriorated 'sharply' in the quarter. In retail and commercial banking, RBS said impairments were up 9 per cent in the first nine months, having been down 2 per cent at the half-year stage.  The trading update was released alongside details of its 20billion capital raising, underwritten by the taxpayer.  RBS is seeking 15billion by offering ordinary shares at 65p, and plans to sell 5billion of preference shares that will pay the Government-12 per cent interest.  With the RBS share price unchanged at 65.2p, there is little incentive for investors to buy shares in the offer. It means the Government will become the biggest shareholder in RBS, with a 60 per cent stake.  Hester said he expects RBS to resume paying dividends in 2010, after it repays the 5billion of Government preference shares. This is a year later than Lloyds TSB, which is also raising 17billion from the Government, and this week said it would resume investor payouts next year after paying back preferred stock.  RBS was yesterday hit by the defection of 2.4million-a-year board member Mark Fisher, who oversaw the successful integration of NatWest. Fisher is joining Lloyds in 2009 as director of group IT and operations, where he will mastermind the merger between the black horse bank with HBOS.  RBS was forced to accept the state-backed rescue after overextending itself with the 49billion purchase of ABN Amro.  It also made a series of bad investments in toxic assets that threatened to bring RBS to its knees.  Former chief Sir Fred Goodwin, and chairman Sir Tom McKillop quit their posts in early October. Hester has requested all the bank's divisions provide him with comprehensive business plans, and he intends to complete a review of the group by the end of 2009.
