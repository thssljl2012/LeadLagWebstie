LONDON (Reuters) - Bank Barclays moved to quell shareholder anger on Tuesday, offering them a slice of a 5.8 billion pound capital injection by Middle Eastern investors.  Barclays said Qatar Holding LLC and Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan would each make up to 250 million pounds of reserve capital instruments available to existing shareholders in the bank in a bookbuilding process.  The bank said no bonuses would be paid to executive directors for 2008 and confirmed an earlier Reuters report that all board members would offer themselves for re-election at the company's annual general meeting in April 2009.
