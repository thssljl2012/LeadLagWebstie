RELATED ARTICLES  3 Mar 2008  23 Apr 2008  24 Sep 2008  14 Aug 2008  COMPANIES MENTIONED  No companies found  WHITE PAPERS  No White Papers Available  The capital raising, which is subject to approval by Barclays shareholders, will be effected through an issue of GBP3 billion of reserve capital instruments, with an associated issue of warrants, and an issue of up to GBP4.3 billion of mandatorily convertible notes (MCNs).  As a result of the capital raising, Barclays expects to satisfy its previously announced commitment to raise new external capital as part of its overall plan to achieve the new higher capital targets set by the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) for all the UK banks.  According to the company, a total of GBP1.25 billion of MCNs have been placed with institutions. Together with the MCNs subscribed for by Qatar Holding, Challenger Universal Limited and entities representing the interests of HH Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the aggregate MCNs to be issued under the capital raising will be GBP4.05 billion. Conversion of the MCNs placed with institutions will result in the issue of 815,522,325 new Barclays ordinary shares, representing 9.7% of Barclays existing issued ordinary share capital.  The capital raising is expected to enable Barclays simultaneously to achieve its tier one and equity capital issuance commitments to the FSA with certainty and ahead of the previously announced timetable; strengthen links with existing large shareholders and introduce a substantial new investor to Barclays; and provide the opportunity for existing institutional shareholders to participate in the capital raising by subscribing for mandatorily convertible notes.  Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Cazenove are acting as joint bookrunners on behalf of Barclays in connection with the institutional placing.
