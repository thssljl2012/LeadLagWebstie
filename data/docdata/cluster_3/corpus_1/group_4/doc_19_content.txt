saying it will let existing stockholders in on a share issue originally earmarked for private Middle Eastern investors.  Barclays said the three Middle Eastern investors _ Qatar Investment Authority, the Challenger investment vehicle led by the Qatari royal family, and Sheik Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the Abu Dhabi royal family _ had offered to allow existing shareholders to purchase 500 million pounds ($752 million) worth of their combined 5.8 billion pound ($8.7 billion) proposed investments. 'The board of Barclays has listened carefully to shareholders' views,' the bank said in a statement announcing the change.  Barclays also said that no bonuses will be paid to board members this year, and that all members of the board would offer themselves for re-election at the bank's annual general meeting in April.  Over the past week there had been growing evidence that current shareholders could vote against the proposed Middle Eastern investment when it is put up for their approval on Nov. 24.  On Monday, key shareholder advisory group PIRC told shareholders to vote against the Middle Eastern capital raising plan. PIRC said the proposed capital injection represents a 'significant dilution' of the holdings of existing shareholders. Last week, another shareholder advisory group, RiskMetrics, also voiced concerns about the deal.  Barclays management sought investments from the Middle East rather than participate in the government's recapitalization plan, in which the government would have taken a stake in the bank.  The Mideast investors have been promised 14 percent annual interest over 10 years for preferred stock. Ordinary shareholders who purchase any of the 500 million pounds of shares that have just been put up for sale will receive the same deal.
