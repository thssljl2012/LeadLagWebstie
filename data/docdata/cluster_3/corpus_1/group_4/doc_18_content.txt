Standard Chartered is investigating whether to raise billions of pounds to bolster its capital base.  The bank, which has focussed on emerging markets in Asia, has asked broker JP Morgan Cazenove to consider options for a cash injection to boost its capital in line with other British banks.  Analysts say it is comfortably within requirements set by regulators.  But its shares have suffered on fears that the economic slowdown will push fast-growing Asia into recession. This gloom has wiped 40%, or 6bn, off the bank's market value over the past few weeks.  Sources close to the firm say 'it is a fair assumption it is looking at its funding options' but no decision had been taken on whether to raise the capital.  It did not participate in the Government's rescue package for banks, stressing its balance sheet remained 'strongly liquid and well capitalised'.  Separately Royal Bank of Scotland confirmed yesterday that its former chairman Sir George Mathewson was still receiving an annual 75,000 fee for his work as a part-time consultant.  While Mathewson has done nothing wrong in earning the fee for his advisory role, the revelation will cause some surprise because he has been lobbying to take over the top post at Halifax Bank of Scotland.  He together with Sir Peter Burt, the former Bank of Scotland chief executive, will continue meeting HBOS shareholders to try to derail its takeover by Lloyds TSB.  Barclays risks derailing its 7bn Middle Eastern fundraising if it tries to dilute the terms in a sop to disgruntled City investors. It has been reported that its Middle Eastern backers do not want the terms of their proposed investment altered.
