The European Commission has today approved an emergency 3.5bn recapitalisation that the Government intends to grant to Bank of Ireland.  The Commission found the measure to be in line with its Guidance Communications on state aid during the current financial crisis, and is compatible with Article 87.3.b. of the EC Treaty.  The measure 'is limited in scope, requires an adequate remuneration and provides safeguards to minimise distortions of competition', according to an EC statement.  26/03/2009: European Commission approves 3.5bn BoI recapitalisation  21/03/2009: TD calls for Irish Nationwide chief to resign  06/03/2009: Brown to outline 'international deal' on bank bonuses  06/03/2009: US bank says Ireland remains remarkably strong  06/03/2009: UK banking giant Lloyds close to nationalisation  02/03/2009: HSBC stops bonuses for top directors  26/02/2009: Lenihan: Next Central Bank boss won't be civil servant  26/02/2009: RBS confirms 24.1bn loss  26/02/2009: British Chancellor calls for retired bank boss to surrender pension  26/02/2009: AIB and BoI 'may need extra 3bn'  26/02/2009: Lenihan to face grilling about ongoing banking crisis
