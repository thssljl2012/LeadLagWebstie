One of the biggest banks in the US has reportedly told its clients that Ireland's financial position is 'remarkably strong' despite the current banking crisis.  Reports this morning say an analysts' at JP Morgan believe Ireland's banks could have to write off almost 27bn in debt in a worst-case scenario, which would require a further 13bn recapitalisation by the Government.  However, it says the Government would be capable of funding such a recapitalisation and points out that Ireland's debt-to-GDP ratio is better than many other euro-zone countries.  06/03/2009: Brown to outline 'international deal' on bank bonuses  06/03/2009: US bank says Ireland remains remarkably strong  06/03/2009: UK banking giant Lloyds close to nationalisation  02/03/2009: HSBC stops bonuses for top directors  26/02/2009: Lenihan: Next Central Bank boss won't be civil servant  26/02/2009: RBS confirms 24.1bn loss  26/02/2009: British Chancellor calls for retired bank boss to surrender pension  26/02/2009: AIB and BoI 'may need extra 3bn'  26/02/2009: Lenihan to face grilling about ongoing banking crisis  18/02/2009: Cowen says he is not protecting anyone but taxpayers  15/02/2009: Bank heads to be held answerable  14/02/2009: UK government considering HBOS options  13/02/2009: Casey resignation 'first step', says Lenihan  13/02/2009: Under-pressure IL&amp;P boss quits  13/02/2009: Two IL&amp;P officials to resign over Anglo deposits  12/02/2009: Rabbitte demands all-party commission on banking practices  12/02/2009: Lenihan: I have done nothing wrong  12/02/2009: Kenny calls for Finance Ministers resignation  12/02/2009: Second Labour TD suspended from Dil  12/02/2009: Labour TD Shortall suspended from Dil  12/02/2009: Gormley mounts staunch defence of Brian Lenihan  12/02/2009: Govt unveils details of 7bn bank recapitalisation plan  11/02/2009: Govt unveils new banks bail-out  11/02/2009: Cowen: Govt unaware of bank's multi-billion euro loans  11/02/2009: Govt knew about deposit before Anglo nationalisation  10/02/2009: Former UK bank bosses 'profoundly sorry'  10/02/2009: FG proposes new banks with clean balance sheets  10/02/2009: Kenny: Govt must stand up to banks  10/02/2009: Cabinet set to approve bank recapitalisation plan  09/02/2009: Teachers to protest at Anglo Irish Bank offices  09/02/2009: RBS staff likely to get bonuses, admits Darling  09/02/2009: Government to seek substantial cut in bankers pay  08/02/2009: Gormley: Pay cuts for bank chiefs must be considered  08/02/2009: Fine Gael demand to see banks' books  07/02/2009: Taoiseach justifies 7bn bailout  06/02/2009: IL&amp;P in 1bn bond bid
