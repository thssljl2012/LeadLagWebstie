Negotiations on a fresh multi-billion pound injection of taxpayers' cash into Lloyds which would see the UK government take a majority stake in the bank appeared finely balanced today.  It is understood that talks between senior bank executives and the UK Treasury have been taking place since yesterday afternoon and there were hopes in Whitehall that an agreement could be announced to the London Stock Exchange later today.  However, in a statement last night, Lloyds Banking Group warned that there was still a lot of detail to be worked through and there was 'no certainty' that a deal would be struck.  It is understood that under the terms of the proposals on the table, the British government would underwrite around 250bn (280.75bn) in 'toxic' assets held by Lloyds Banking Group, limiting its potential losses in a bid to get it lending again.  At the same time, the bank would convert the costly preference shares held by the British government - on which it is currently paying 12% interest - into ordinary shares, which attract no interest.  The move would see the British government's stake in the bank rise from 43% to around 60%, giving it a greater say in the way the bank is run as ordinary shares - unlike preference shares - carry voting rights.  A Treasury spokesman said last night that discussions were 'ongoing', adding: 'A deal will be announced at the conclusion of those discussions.'  However Lloyds head of communications, Shane O'Riordain, said there could be no certainty about the outcome.  'Our conversations with the Treasury are continuing about our potential participation in the asset protection scheme,' he said.  'This is a complex subject and there is a good deal of detail to be worked through. Our conversations have not yet concluded and there can be no certainty about the outcome.'  The Treasury has already struck a similar deal with Royal Bank of Scotland. Lloyds has been forced to go to the British government for further support because of the heavy losses run up by HBOS which it took over to prevent its collapse.  06/03/2009: Brown to outline 'international deal' on bank bonuses  06/03/2009: US bank says Ireland remains remarkably strong  06/03/2009: 02/03/2009: HSBC stops bonuses for top directors  26/02/2009: Lenihan: Next Central Bank boss won't be civil servant  26/02/2009: RBS confirms 24.1bn loss  26/02/2009: British Chancellor calls for retired bank boss to surrender pension  26/02/2009: AIB and BoI 'may need extra 3bn'  26/02/2009: Lenihan to face grilling about ongoing banking crisis  18/02/2009: Cowen says he is not protecting anyone but taxpayers  15/02/2009: Bank heads to be held answerable  14/02/2009: UK government considering HBOS options  13/02/2009: Casey resignation 'first step', says Lenihan  13/02/2009: Under-pressure IL&amp;P boss quits  13/02/2009: Two IL&amp;P officials to resign over Anglo deposits  12/02/2009: Rabbitte demands all-party commission on banking practices  12/02/2009: Lenihan: I have done nothing wrong  12/02/2009: Kenny calls for Finance Ministers resignation  12/02/2009: Second Labour TD suspended from Dil  12/02/2009: Labour TD Shortall suspended from Dil  12/02/2009: Gormley mounts staunch defence of Brian Lenihan  12/02/2009: Govt unveils details of 7bn bank recapitalisation plan  11/02/2009: Govt unveils new banks bail-out  11/02/2009: Cowen: Govt unaware of bank's multi-billion euro loans  11/02/2009: Govt knew about deposit before Anglo nationalisation  10/02/2009: Former UK bank bosses 'profoundly sorry'  10/02/2009: FG proposes new banks with clean balance sheets  10/02/2009: Kenny: Govt must stand up to banks  10/02/2009: Cabinet set to approve bank recapitalisation plan  09/02/2009: Teachers to protest at Anglo Irish Bank offices  09/02/2009: RBS staff likely to get bonuses, admits Darling  09/02/2009: Government to seek substantial cut in bankers pay  08/02/2009: Gormley: Pay cuts for bank chiefs must be considered  08/02/2009: Fine Gael demand to see banks' books  07/02/2009: Taoiseach justifies 7bn bailout  06/02/2009: IL&amp;P in 1bn bond bid
