Search Search Go  Bookmark &amp; Share  Despair gripped world markets last night, as shares plummeted on both sides of the Atlantic, dragging the Dow Jones industrial average to its first drop below 7,000 in more than 11 years and the FTSE 100 Index to a six-year low.  The Dublin market fared no better on another meltdown Monday, with the ISEQ slumping to its lowest close since June 19, 1995, following huge losses at insurance giant American International Group (AIG), and news of a massive rights issue by HSBC bank in Britain.  Banking giant HSBCs call on investors for a UK record 12.5bn to prop up its finances triggered a wave of selling as confidence took a fresh battering  wiping 49.7bn off blue-chip stocks.  On Wall Street, the US Dow Jones index fell below 7,000 points for the first time since October 1997. Many investors now fear the market could take a long time to recover to its record high of over 14,000 in October 2007.  As bad as things are, they can still get worse, and get a lot worse, said Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist for Bell Curve Trading.  Strazzullo said he believes theres a significant chance the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow will fall back to their 1995 levels of 500 and 5,000, respectively.  The game-changer, he said, will be the US housing market and whether it can stabilise.  HSBCs 62% profits slide  alongside writedowns totalling a mammoth $24.9bn (17.5bn)  came as US insurer AIG announced the biggest quarterly loss in corporate history.  The stricken group tumbled a staggering $61.7bn (43.9bn) into the red in the last three months of 2008, and has been rescued by US taxpayers for a third time.  A plunge in Asian markets  reacting to grim output figures from the US before the weekend  already had investors in London on edge before the cash call from heavyweight HSBC sent them scrambling for the exit.  The Footsie tumbled below 3665  the low hit last October at the height of the banking crisis  to levels not seen since March 2003. Shares closed at 3625.8  a fall of 5.3%.  Markets in France and Germany skidded down while Wall Streets Dow Jones Industrial Average shipped 3% in early trading.  Sterling also weakened to 90p against the euro for the first time in two weeks, and slipped versus the yen and the Swiss franc.  But Dublin bank shares enjoyed a good day, with gains averaging almost 10% after AIB issued annual results confirming a 1.8bn bad loan write-off but, stating that annual profits were 1bn before tax.  CMC Markets analyst James Hughes said the Footsies low of 3287 six years ago could be under threat amid the woes of the banking sector.  At the moment there is so much going on. Because of the uncertainty and open-ended debts nobody knows the extent of it  it just seems bottomless, he said.  HSBC has not been forced to call on state support so far  unlike Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and HBOS  but the record rights issue sent shockwaves through the market.  At one stage its shares collapsed nearly 25% to their lowest level since 1998, wiping more than 13bn off the value of the business. HSBC eventually closed almost 19% down.  Its pre-tax profits also slid to $9.3bn (6.5bn) in 2008 and it also announced plans to wind down its US consumer lending business in a humiliating reversal of strategy.  HSBC spent $15bn dollars (10.7bn) on the Household business in 2003, but the withdrawal will cost 6,100 jobs as branches close.  HSBCs chairman said the bank was paying no bonuses for top directors and launched a wide-ranging attack on failings in the industry for causing a major breakdown in trust.  After yesterdays record, AIGs losses now total $100bn (71bn) over the past five quarters.
