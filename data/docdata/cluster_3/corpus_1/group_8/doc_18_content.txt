Times Online reports: ...Eric Danielss facade slipped only for a moment, and then when it was least expected. Daniels, 57, renowned for his Buddha-like calm, was under extreme pressure. He was in the middle of a desperate fight to stop the government taking control of his bank. If he failed, he and his chairman, the City grandee Sir Victor Blank, would forever be remembered as the men who steered Lloyds, the pride of British banking, onto the rocks.  Excusing himself for not being able to talk about the battle with the Treasury, Daniels spoke instead about his career. He had once worked for the US bank Citigroup in Latin America and employed a local man called Cristobal, who had blossomed under his tutelage. Daniels eyes misted when he recalled his Panamanian protg, and he wiped away a tear.  Any tears Daniels might shed this weekend would not be the result of the wistful recollection of success, but more likely of abject failure. On Friday, he and Blank lost their fight. After days of fractious negotiations, the government took majority ownership of Lloyds in return for insuring it against future losses on 260 billion of toxic loans.
