 Firstplus today became the latest casualty in the troubled home loans sector with the announcement that it is to stop writing new business.The move by the group, which is owned by Barclaycard, will lead to 300 job cuts in its Cardiff office.Its departure will leave just seven players in the market, down from 18 last year before the credit crunch hit.Firstplus, which is known for its adverts fronted by Carol Vorderman, said it would no longer be writing new business from August 9 due to a fall in demand.It said it had taken steps to try to boost business, including launching new brand Fair &amp;amp; Square, which aimed to make home loans more transparent.It also tried to target a new group of consumers by advertising Fair &amp;amp; Square on mainstream channels and during prime-time television, whereas Firstplus adverts had typically run on daytime shows.Other innovations included offering lower interest rates for an introductory period.But the group said demand for the product was simply not there, leading to todays decision. The news caused shares in financial website Moneysupermarket.com to slide by 17%, as the group issued a trading statement warning that revenues would be down by 7 million following the withdrawal of Firstplus from the home loans sector, while underlying earnings would fall by up to 5 million. The group, which earns fees when people take out products through its website, said it would try to offset the loss of Firstplus through tie-ups with other providers and by reviewing costs and advertising spending.Home loans enable people to borrow money against the value of their property without increasing the size of their mortgage, although they are typically charged higher rates for the products of at least 8%, rising to around 20% for people with poor credit ratings.But the sector has been battered in recent months due to the housing market downturn and the ongoing problems in the mortgage market, with providers raising their rates and reducing the loan-to-value ratios they are prepared to advance.Other high profile players that have withdrawn in recent months include Southern Pacific Personal Loans, while Picture has also stopped writing new business, although it hopes to re-enter the market.Neil Radley, managing director of Firstplus, said: In the past year we have tried a whole range of activities to develop our business but the market demand simply isnt strong enough. The UKs biggest trade union Unite said it was incensed at the decision to cut 300 jobs at Firstplus, adding that it had secured an agreement from Barclays to seek alternative jobs for those who wanted to remain employed in the bank, although these options were likely to be limited. Deputy general secretary Graham Goddard said: Whilst the union understand that the market conditions mean that the Firstplus product is no longer viable, we wholeheartedly condemn the decision to run down the Cardiff site. Barclays should replace the 300 jobs lost with work from other parts of the bank. Around 130 staff will be retained at the Cardiff office to look after existing customers, whose loans will not be affected by todays announcement.
