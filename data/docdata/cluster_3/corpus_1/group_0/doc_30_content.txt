 NewSpring Capital said Wednesday its NewSpring Mezzanine fund provided $4 million in mezzanine debt to help fund a $13.25 million buyout of Thermacore Inc.In the deal, which closed in May, Thermacore's management and other investors purchased the Lancaster, Pa., company from Racine, Wis.-based Modine Manufacturing Co. Modine (NYSE:MOD) bought Thermacore, which makes products that transport and dissipate excess heat within electronics and computer equipment, for $110 million in 2001. NewSpring Mezzanine was the sole provider of mezzanine debt in the deal. Mezzanine debt gets its name because it has debt and equity components and so falls in between debt and equity on a balance sheet. As part of the financing, Steve Hobman of NewSpring Mezzanine will join Thermacore's board of directors. Argosy Partners of Wayne, Pa., and Penn Venture Partners LP of Harrisburg, Pa., led the equity financing along with Thermacore's management. Senior debt financing was provided by National Penn Bank and Barclays Bank.
