 BHP Billiton, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, , Rio Tinto, Telstra and Woodside Petroleum. These are Australia's six largest listed companies and they each have a market capitalisation larger than the entire New Zealand sharemarket.At $54 billion, the combined value of all the companies on the New Zealand sharemarket's main board is at its lowest ebb since 2004 on a nominal basis - or the year before when adjusted for inflation.Since then, the overall economy, as measured by GDP, has grown by almost 16 per cent.This alarming phenomenon has not passed unnoticed by the Government, which yesterday said it would shortly launch a taskforce to come up with a blueprint for deepening our capital markets. But has it left it too late?Up until last year, even as our economy appeared to be booming, the sharemarket was being hollowed out as cashed-up Australian corporates and rapacious private equity firms jacked up on cheap credit, picked it over, and snaffled some of our best and brightest businesses.The credit crunch may have burst the private equity bubble, and overall merger and acquisition activity has largely paused, but the turmoil on international markets has continued to siphon value out of the sharemarket.The share prices of a number of our remaining blue-chip stocks such as Fletcher Building and SkyCity have fallen to levels that must surely make them extremely attractive to overseas buyers.While potential bidders are probably, like most other market participants, hunkering down as the credit crisis wears on, it's reasonable to assume that any sign things are blowing over will see them return to snap up some bargains.Should that happen, the already skinny looking NZX may be in danger of withering away completely.The Shareholders Association's Bruce Sheppard tells of attending a  talkfest late last year where the participants included fund managers, brokerage bosses and chief executives of big listed companies. With very few exceptions, Sheppard said: 'Not one of them said NZX has a future.' Sheppard said the general consensus was that it was 'only a matter of time before the planets line up and it won't be economic to run NZ Inc from anywhere other than Sydney as a branch operation'. 'Unfortunately a whole bunch of those stars we thought needed to line up for that outcome to become reality have now done so.' Some might argue that as long as our companies are getting the capital they need, does it really matter whether they are listed in New Zealand or not? Furthermore, the Australians now own virtually all of our banking sector and the sky hasn't fallen has it?
