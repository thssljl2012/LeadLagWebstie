 lmost 70 per cent of Australians believe the country's four largest banks are failing to provide their customers value for money on their credit cards, a new survey has found.The survey by click4credit.com.au, a credit card comparison website, found 69.2 per cent of the 500 respondents polled disagreed with the statement 'the big four banks Australian banks provide the best credit card offers'. The 'big four' - ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and Westpac - are falling behind their competitors such as St George, BankWest, HSBC and Citibank when it comes to offering low-interest, low-fee credit card products, click4credit director Richard Greenwood says. 'Clearly there is demand for competitive products, as many of these banks are enjoying double-digit growth in credit card customers,' Mr Greenwood said. He said compared to other nations, such as the UK and US, Australians pay far greater average annual fees and higher interest rates.He said banks need to offer a range of credit cards to suit all types of customers, such as low-interest credit cards for those that can't pay the bill in full each month, cards with excellent reward programs for high spenders and no annual fee credit cards for occasional users. 'As competition in credit products heats up, the likes of Westpac and NAB will have no choice but to follow suit, or lose a significant portion of the market share,' Mr Greenwood said. 'The days of the big banks extorting high annual fees, in a market with little competition, is surely over.'
