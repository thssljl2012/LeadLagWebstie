 The National Australia Bank is under pressure to provide more details on its exposure to securities linked to subprime assets in the United States and Europe.Analysts believe a lack of disclosure could damage the bank's reputation, after it announced on Friday that a $181 million provision earmarked for the falling value of complex debt instruments might not be big enough in the worsening economic climate.With NAB joining the majority of its rivals in raising mortgage rates yesterday, the banking team at UBS estimated the potential for future losses from the debt instruments could exceed $150 million.'We believe NAB continues to provide inadequate disclosure on this exposure, which was mentioned on page 68 of its last results,' the analyst's team wrote in a note to clients, in which they cut their price target for NAB by 16 per cent, from $34.50 to $29.Merrill Lynch also downgraded the bank to 'neutral' on the back of its exposure to overseas loans, cutting its price target from $34.70 to $32.20.NAB shares were the biggest mover among the banking stocks yesterday, falling 98c, or 3.57 per cent, to $26.47.While Australian banks are relatively immune to the problems driving the downturn in the US housing market, NAB is said to be the most exposed to subprime assets among the major local banks.Unease about the level of disclosure came as NAB joined St George Bank, the Commonwealth Bank and ANZ in raising interest rates for home loan borrowers in response to the credit turmoil, lifting its standard variable mortgage rate by 0.15 percentage points to 9.61 per cent.In its half-yearly report to March, NAB said it had provided liquidity lines to a number of 'conduits' - or investment trusts that sit off the bank's balance sheet.While the bank is not directly exposed to assets held by the trusts, those trusts can call on the NAB if they are short of liquidity.The bank reported its conduits had invested $5.4 billion in corporate bonds and such things as collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO is a security that bundles up a parcel of loans - for example, mortgage, car or credit card loans - that pays the investor interest and principal from the original loans.In March, NAB said ratings agencies had downgraded about $US1.1 billion worth of CDOs it was exposed to, of which $360 million were US subprime mortgages.Merrill Lynch said that while it understood another $4 billion in loans that made up NAB's European conduit were continuing to perform and have not received any ratings changes, 'we would retain some caution on these assets.'Citing concerns about potential damage to the bank's reputation, UBS analysts said NAB continued to provide little detail on its exposure to high-risk securities following, in their view, poor disclosure in its first-half results.A spokeswoman for NAB said the half-yearly disclosure was 'quite a detailed overview'.
