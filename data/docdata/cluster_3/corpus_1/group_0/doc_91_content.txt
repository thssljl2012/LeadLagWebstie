Why not add your thoughts below?Add to that Labour's tax theft/grab from our private pensions, and this is not looking good.- David, UK, 09/7/2008 06:45I wish it was only the uber-rich who were affected by this! However, it's likely to affect the middle classes far more as they are the people most likely to have invested in private and occupational pensions. These pension funds are usually invested in the stock market. Of course, one class it won't affect are the civil service gold plated pension holders! Once more McBroon and his cronies have robbed us of our pensions through crass mismanagement of the national finances whilst ensuring their financial security.- Simon Bailey, Long Eaton, UK, 09/7/2008 05:24
