 SYDNEY, July 23 (Reuters) - Australian billionaire investor Solomon Lew raised his bid for clothing retailer Just Group Ltd (ASX: JST.ax) to A$810 million ($784 million), offering more cash in a final offer if he achieves 90 percent control, despite Just having cut its 2008 earnings forecast.Lew's Premier Investments (ASX: PMV.ax) stepped up pressure on Just shareholders, who have been holding out for four months, saying on Wednesday it would not extend its offer beyond Aug. 15 unless it gets acceptances for more than 50 percent of Just shares within the last week of the offer period. 'I think it's a very reasonable offer given the operating environment,' said John Sevior, head of Australian equities for Perpetual Investments, which owns close to 5 percent of Just. 'It's incumbent on the Just board to give it serious consideration,' he said. Shares in Just jumped 13 percent to A$3.29, but were still 18 percent below the implied A$4.02 value of the higher offer and below the A$3.87 a share value of the original offer, indicating scepticism in the market that a deal will get done.Just has around 880 stores in Australia and New Zealand with brands targeted at teenagers, including Just Jeans, Dotti and Jayjays. 'It's our understanding that shareholders aren't enamoured of receiving Premier stock,' said an industry source who declined to be identified.Lew justified the higher offer even with Australian consumer sentiment at a 16-year low and retail conditions far from turning around, saying he did not want the offer to remain open until Christmas and let Just's business deteriorate further.Just, which considered Lew's bid opportunistic, had no immediate comment on the new offer.Premier currently holds 24.76 percent of Just and only 2 percent of shareholders have accepted the offer so far.Lew said he decided to sweeten the offer by $30 million after talking to Just's institutional shareholders, some of whom have now indicated they will accept the new offer, including possibly Perpetual Investments.Lew declined to identify who had said they would back the bid. Other major shareholders are AXA SA AXAF.PA with 11.8 percent and Barclays Global Investors, with 10.6 percent, according to Reuters data.The offer has been raised by 15 cents a share to A$2.245 cash and 0.25 Premier shares for each Just share. Premier said the offer was final.Premier said Just shareholders who accepted the offer by Aug. 6 would be entitled to Premier's final dividend, equating to 4.5 cents per Just share.Premier said with the additional 15 cents in cash plus its dividend, its offer represented an earnings multiple of 14.1 to 16.4 based on Just's downgraded earnings forecast of 27.3 to 28.7 cents a share for 2008.Just's shares had fallen 9 percent since it issued a profit warning on July 2, while the index of consumer discretionary stocks .AXDJ has dipped 0.5 percent.
