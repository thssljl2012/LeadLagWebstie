 52-week range: $28.01 [Jan. 22, 2008]  $53.55 [Aug. 8, 2007]Recreational farming and ranching has been booming in suburban and rural areas of America. Tractor supply serves this market with livestock and pet products, hardware, tools, snow blowers, mowers and other products. Following the acquisition of a competitor in 2002, sales and earning grew dramatically. 2007 saw all-time records in every category yet today's poor economy has caused TSCO shares to plummet by 58% from an March 2006 high of $67.60 to just $28.50 currently.Here are the per share numbers* since 2002:Year ...

Compare those to their historical P/Es in the chart above. The price/book value and price/sales are now at levels last seen during 2001's recession. Investors who purchased during that last recession saw their shares go from a split-adjusted $2.10/share to $44.90 before the end of 2003.Debt is low at just 16% of capital and with total interest coverage of 19x last year. Value Line awards TSCO an 'A+' financial strength rating.Despite all the positive factors these shares are now offered for a share price that is lower than the lows touched for even one day from July 2003 right through year-end 2007.Some well known holders [as of March 31, 2008]:Capital Research and Mgt. .... 11.30%Resources ..... .................5.99%AMCAP Fund .. 6.76%Southern Sun Asset Mgt. . 4.34%Thomas W.

Even a lower than typical 16 multiple on the 2009 estimate of $2.85 leads me to a goal of $45.60 or up 60% from today's quote.Is that achievable? TSCO shares hit peak prices of $44.90 - $67.60 as some point in each calendar year from 2003  2007 when fundamentals were well below where they are now.Let's hope these shares do well as Bill and Melinda may need the money.*************************************************************If you like Tractor Supply but want a lower risk play consider this:...
