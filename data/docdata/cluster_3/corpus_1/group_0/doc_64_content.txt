 Emirates NBD, the product of the first big banking merger in the country, has a lofty goal.We want to be the largest bank in the Middle East, said Ahmed Humaid al Tayer, its chairman. But still, eight months after agreeing to a merger, the company has yet to come up with a common logo.Consolidation is a well established trend in the global banking sector but it is one that the local industry has largely sidestepped. For this reason, the Emirates NBD merger stands out as the exception.That said, the consolidation process for Emirates Bank and the National Bank of Dubai is progressing, albeit at a pedestrian pace.Still, many argue that a crowded field of more than 50 domestic and international banks needs further consolidation.The result would be fewer, but larger and therefore more muscular institutions able to fend off global competition. Large banks are also more likely to have the resources to implement international benchmarks such as Basel II, the worldwide standard for capital allocation and operational risk management.Worldwide, banks have been going through the process of consolidation, Mr Tayer said. I think if you want to face the future and comply with regulations like Basel II, you need to create banks here that can face up to international competition and requirements in the best way.The question, however, is whether the countrys 42 domestic banks should consolidate while they are flush with cash and enjoying robust profit growth, or wait to be forced into mergers during a downturn.Raj Madha, a banking analyst at EFG Hermes, offered one reason why consolidation may not be a good idea during an economic boom. When you have a merger, there are a lot of processes that go into it. You invest all your time in that, and then you cant invest your time in devising new strategies. Thats the cost of acquisitions and mergers, he said.Although Emirates NBD officials have not disclosed how much the union cost them, they admit that it was an expensive, lengthy and complicated process, especially since neither the company nor regulators have a domestic model to follow.The biggest challenge is that this is the first of its kind and its the first of this size. Thats why the legal merger hasnt happened yet, said Jan Hendrik Kraus, the general manager in charge of integrating the two companies.Emirates and NBD are still separate brands, even though the companys stock has traded as one since October. Legally, however, they are still two companies and are at least six months away from full unification.While consolidation during these boom times could be a distraction, some argue that a merged entity could ultimately have the advantage over its competitors in a flourishing economy, as larger banks will find it easier to raise foreign capital and are more likely to secure corporate transactions.The UAE Government is expected to spend about 60 per cent of the estimated US$1.3 trillion (Dh4.75tn) that GCC governments will invest in the next 10 years on infrastructure.As things stand now, most domestic banks are overshadowed by the sheer size of the financing requirements for these projects.Before its merger with the countrys fourth-largest bank, Emirates had slightly more assets than the National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD), the countrys second-largest bank.After the merger, Emirates NBDs assets stood at Dh254bn at the end of last year, while NBAD trailed with an asset base of Dh139b, and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank (ADCB) was the third-largest bank with Dh106bn in assets.Local banks will also be hard-pressed to compete with large international players such as Standard Chartered, Britains sixth-largest bank with assets of $142bn, which recently opened an Abu Dhabi branch specifically to win some of the financing business related to the capitals ambitious development projects. Barclays and HSBC are other international behemoths who want a piece of the regional pie.The economic rationale for the Emirates NBD merger was more than anything to increase the sheer size of the bank, so it can execute the big-ticket projects, said Mihir Marfatia, a banking analyst at The National Investor (TNI).Mr Kraus said the bank had already secured a number of large financing deals this year that it may not have won before the merger; there was a $6bn contract with Borse Dubai, a $5bn deal with Dubai World and one worth $4.8bn with Emal, the aluminium smelter currently under construction.The merger has also increased our ability to undertake underwriting commitments of sizeable quantum, Mr Kraus said.Analysts say it is still too early to see tangible results from the merger, but TNI increased its earnings forecasts this year for Emirates NBD to Dh5.2bn, up from Dh4.8bn, after the bank reported a 37 per cent increase in profits in the first quarter.You can easily say that they have had strong performance, the profits increased and you can see more benefits than if they were on a stand-alone basis, Mr Marfatia said.The marriage between the two Dubai banks complemented their services. Emirates had a wider branch footprint than NBD, but it did not have a mortgage book until the merger.Emirates was strong in business banking, whereas NBD had a stronger presence in investment business; these two tend to be complementary, Mr Madha said.Emirates had also operated Emirates Islamic Bank, which will continue as a separate subsidiary of the Emirates NBD Group when the merger is officially completed.Mr Marfatia believed that NBAD and ADCB would similarly make a good pairing.Michael Tomalin, NBADs chief executive, said in a May interview that he believed in consolidation, but that the bank was not actively discussing it with anyone.And while the rest of the industry is not blind to the advantage of a merger, most bankers are too busy making hay in the regions bright economic climate to devote time to manage a complex tie-up.At the same time, competitors are closely watching Emirates NBD to see how it weathers the tricky process of integration. Earlier this month, the bank unified its corporate accounts, and plans to complete integrating all the services of Emirates and NBD by early next year.There is also the question of how motivated the regions banks will be to merge or hang out the for sale sign; the lure of large financing deals might not be tempting enough for them to do so at a time when the industrys assets have grown by an average of about 41 per cent annually in the past three years, with no slowdown in sight.Mr Marfatia said he expected profit growth of 22 per cent annually for the next three years. Consolidation is much talked about and desired, but nothing has been discussed, he said. Its a hard sell now, everyone is making money. Pure economics stands against it until some banks go into moratorium or falling out due to competition or bad decisions.What makes consolidation particularly unappealing is that buying a bank here would mean acquiring a successful business and paying a premium for it. For this reason, some believe it is wiser to wait until opportunities for organic growth dry up and bank shares are not trading at a premium to their value.Still, Emirates NBD believes that its model of merging while the market is full of opportunities is the one to emulate. Its always better to do it at a time when it wasnt required to do so, Mr Kraus said.Another option for banks to increase their size could be to use their bulging wallets to acquire institutions in markets outside the country. The Gulfs other major banking consolidation was the Commercial Bank of Qatars acquisition of a 40 per cent stake in the Sharjah-based United Arab Bank in October.A major hurdle to inter-regional mergers, however, is that of ownership; many of the regions banks are government-owned. Would a small bank in one of the northern emirates, for example, agree to merge or be acquired by a large Abu Dhabi or Dubai bank? Every emirate wants to position itself in a different way, Mr Marfatia observed.
