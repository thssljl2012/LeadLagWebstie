 (Adds details on investors, share price)LONDON, July 18 (Reuters) - Barclays' (BARC.L: Quote, Profile, Research) shareholders took up just 19 percent of new shares in the British bank's recently announced fundraising, meaning the bulk of the money will be provided by mostly new 'anchor' investors led by Qatar.Britain's third-biggest bank said last month it had raised 4.5 billion pounds ($9 billion) from major investors in Qatar, Japan, China, Singapore and elsewhere, and it would give existing shareholders the chance to buy on the same terms.That allowed them to buy shares at 282 pence each. However, Barclays shares traded below that level for much of the week, reducing the incentive to buy.Barclays said shareholders had signed up to 267.1 million new shares, which dealers said was slightly less than expected, and the remaining 1.14 billion new shares would be taken by the 'anchor' investors.Banks across the world have been trying to raise money to boost their balance sheets which have been hit by write-downs on risky assets due to the lock down in credit markets.Qatari investors will own just over 8 percent of Barclays, after its sovereign wealth fund paid about 1.4 billion pounds for a 6.2 percent stake and a member of its ruling family bought a 1.9 percent holding for about 432 million pounds, based on each anchor investor getting 81 percent of their allocation.
