 St George Bank's reliance on domestic, non-retail deposits has most likely prompted the move to raise its standard variable mortgage rate by 0.2 of a per cent, a banking analyst says. The increase takes the bank's variable home loan rate to 9.67 per cent. The rise will add $40 a month to a $250,000 mortgage. Banking research firm East and Partners' principal analyst, Paul Dowling, has told ABC 1's Midday Report that St George is probably the most challenged of the big five banks because of its funding mix. 'They have the highest proportion of funding sourced from offshore wholesale markets,' he said. 'It's in that space that the margin squeeze is particularly tight, so they're more reliant on non-retail deposit monies funding their lending books domestically here in Australia.' Mr Dowling says he expects other banks to follow St George's lead by increasing their standard variable mortgage rates.He says the fallout from the United States subprime mortgage crisis has led to a significant increase in funding costs. 'Our expectation would be that the other four majors in the market will also look to increase retail lending rates,' he said. 'It's a systemic issue for most of the banks. 'Their margins are being squeezed.' More Quotes and Company Information:ST GEORGE BANK LIMITED (ASX: SGB.ax)
