 HBOS (UK:HBOS: news, chart, profile) said 1.38 billion shares remain unsold, reflecting a slump in the stock in recent weeks that left it trading below the 275-pence rights issue price ahead of a Friday deadline. The underwriters -- Morgan Stanley (MS:MSNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) and the Dresdner Kleinwort unit of Germany's Allianz (AZ:AZNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) (DE:840400: news, chart, profile) -- along with any sub-underwriters, now have until the end of trading on Tuesday to find subscribers for the stock at or above the issue price. After that, Morgan Stanley, Dresdner and any other banks that they have lined up to back the deal will subscribe for the remaining stock. HBOS shares fell 2% to stand at 277 pence in early trading Monday, reflecting worries that the stock will come under pressure as the underwriters try to offload shares. The stock has dropped more than 70% in the last year as the U.K. housing market has weakened and mortgage lending volumes have slumped. The stock had rebounded slightly to close at 282 pence on Friday, but the move was too late to spark significant interest in the offering. Last Wednesday, when many institutional investors would have been making a final decision on the rights issue, the stock dropped as low as 225 pence -- the lowest level since the group's Halifax arm first listed in 1997. While HBOS, which has about a 20% share of the U.K. mortgage market, is guaranteed to receive the 4 billion pounds it needs, the problems with its rights issue and difficulties for other U.K. banks could make underwriters nervous about backing future capital-raising efforts in the sector.  Shareholders of troubled mortgage lender Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley (UK:BB: news, chart, profile) approved its rights issue of 400 million pounds late last week, only after two earlier attempts to raise the cash fell apart. In Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley's case, major shareholders have publicly agreed to back the rights issue, and underwriters have spread the risk of having to buy up the remaining shares. And on Friday, Barclays (UK:BARC: news, chart, profile) (BCS:BCSNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) said shareholders had applied for just 19% of the 1.4 billion shares it's issuing as part of a 4.5 billion pound fundraising. In Barclays case, however, the bank had already agreed to sell the remaining shares to new and existing investors in Asia and the Middle East. LONDON (MarketWatch) -- HBOS, the U.K.'s biggest mortgage lender, said Monday that shareholders had bought just 8.3% of the shares available in its 4 billion pound ($8 billion) rights issue, leaving underwriters scrambling to find buyers for the remaining stock.
