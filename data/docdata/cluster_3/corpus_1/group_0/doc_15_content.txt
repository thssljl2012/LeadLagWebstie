 National Australia Bank Ltd chief executive John Stewart says the bank has no more exposure to the troubled housing market in the United States but expects the situation in the US will worsen.On Friday, the National booked a $830 million writedown on risky US mortgages, which sent the bank's share price plummeting. 'This is the bottom for us for housing in the US because we are now cleared out,' Mr Stewart told ABC TV. Mr Stewart said NAB's other business continued to do well and the company's dividend would therefore be unaffected by the $830 million provision.Mr Stewart said the situation for the US housing market would probably worsen. 'Things are going to get worse,' he said. 'There are more than 18 million vacant properties for sale in the United States just now. That's more than the whole housing stock of Australia.' Mr Stewart said that even before the US housing crisis started, house prices were dropping as a result of over-stocking. 'They had just built too many houses, so the market was soft,' he said. 'Then you got the crisis that started with sub-prime that has now moved into different asset classes.' In the US, people were literally walking away from their houses as their equity in them became negative. 'If that happens, continually happens, then these houses come on the market and, of course, they further depress prices,' Mr Stewart said. He said it was a worrying time for the US economy and it would be some time before it recovered. Mr Stewart said the National would not have to raise new equity to account for the provision. 'No, we don't,' he said.
