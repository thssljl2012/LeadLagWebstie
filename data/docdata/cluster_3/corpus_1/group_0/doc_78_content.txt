After two previous attempts to raise extra funds fell through, B&amp;amp;B hopes this will be third time lucky  although the two previous failures seem to have hammered the management teams credibility, judging by some of the reported comments from shareholders today...Guy Jubb of Standard Life (one of the four big shareholders who have teamed up to back B&amp;amp;Bs new rights issue) took the unusual step of turning up in person to the public meeting, to chastise the board about their earlier plan to give up shareholder pre-emption rights (the right to buy shares on the same terms) when they were trying to flog a chunk of the company to US private equity house TPG. And several smaller shareholders also expressed their dissatisfaction with chairman Sir Rod Kents handling of the whole affair  for which he was suitably apologetic. Were it not for the fact that only about ten shareholders and their dogs showed up to the meeting (which was inexplicably held in the 12,000-capacity Sheffield Arena), he might have got even more of an ear-bashing.And B&amp;amp;Bs not the only bank sweating today. Its also a big day for fundraising at HBOS and Barclays, both of whom are coming towards the end of their respective rights issues. Barclays, whose issue closes today, has been boosted by the Qatar Investment Authoritys decision to pile in with an extra 1.5bn, increasing its stake to nearly 8% (the Qatari PMs personal vehicle is also buying a further 2%)  clearly they've decided to double up in the hope that this investment will eventually make them some moneyAs for HBOS, the outcome of its rights issue - which closes tomorrow  is still under a cloud. Like B&amp;amp;B, its currently trading below the offer price, despite a brief rally this morning. So if fund managers decide not to exercise their right to buy the new shares, it would force the underwriters (Morgan Stanley and Dresdner Kleinwort) to cough up for a substantial portion of the new shares  which would cost them hundreds of millions of pounds. Not really what they need at the momentEither way, its going to be an expensive week in the City. We suspect the fine wine and dining establishments in the Square Mile may be a little quieter than usual tomorrow night...In today's bulletin:
