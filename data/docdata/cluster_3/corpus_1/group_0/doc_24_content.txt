 The Co-operative Groups takeover of Somerfield could be completed this week but delays are still possible, the Financial Times reported today.The paper quoted a source close to Somefield shareholder Apax Partners as saying it had been really tough getting the deal over the line.It suggests that the Manchester-based Co-op has driven a hard bargain since it became the only bidder left in the race.Somerfields owners, who also include Barclays Capital and Robert Tchenguiz, originally wanted at least 1.9bn, but the Co-op may have driven the price as low as 1.5bn compared to the 1.7bn it originally offered in April. The retail slowdown and increase competition for grocery sales has hit valuations in the sector.The Co-op will probably have to dispose of up to 200 of Somerfields stores to keep the Competition Commission happy, also at lower valuations.
