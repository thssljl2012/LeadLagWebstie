 THE financial services sector in Wales was dealt another blow yesterday after 300 jobs were cut at Firstplus by parent company Barclays.Cardiff-based Firstplus made the move in the wake of job losses at rivals Picture Financial and Principality Building Society subsidiary Nemo Personal Finance.And it means that about 525 jobs have been lost in personal finance in South Wales in less than three months, following the announcement of redundancies at Zurich Insurance in Cardiff last week.Barclays was yesterday condemned by the Unite trade union for making the jobs cuts. The union said it was incensed at the decision and calling on the bank to replace the jobs.Barclays said its homeloans venture Firstplus will stop making new loans to customers from August 9 due to slowing demand.Around 130 people will be retained in Cardiff to look after existing customers and about 300 staff will be affected by the decision, said Barclays, adding that every effort was being made to find them alternative jobs across the Barclays businesses.Neil Radley, managing director of Firstplus, said: In the past year we have tried a whole range of activities to develop our business but the market demand simply isnt strong enough. We recognise this is a difficult time for our people and will be providing all those affected with support and assistance. Reports over the future of Firstplus have been circulating since last summer, with speculation that Barclays was looking for a buyer for the business.The company never made its intentions public but it had been thought that Frits Seegers, head of Barclays global retail business, wanted to sell the business at a loss, rather than risk exposure to rising bad debt charges.However efforts to sell Firstplus seem to have gone by the wayside and the company has instead settled on making 300 staff redundant.Unite deputy general secretary Graham Goddard said: While the union understands that the market conditions mean that the Firstplus product is no longer viable, we wholeheartedly condemn the decision to run down the Cardiff site. Barclays should replace the 300 jobs lost with work from other parts of the bank. Barclays has few large centres in Wales compared to other large banks, which makes this decision all the more regretful. We are calling on Barclays to reconsider and replace these jobs in Cardiff. Unite said it had secured agreement from Barclays to seek alternative employment for those who wished to remain employed in the bank, although these options were likely to be limited. The Cardiff-based company was established in 1997 by Neville Allport, who also went on to start up Picture Financial  now operating to service its existing loans from customers.Home loans enable people to borrow money against the value of their property without increasing the size of their mortgage, although they are typically charged higher rates for the products of at least 8%, rising to around 20% for people with poor credit ratings.But the sector has been battered in recent months due to the housing market downturn and the ongoing problems in the mortgage market, with providers raising their rates and reducing the loan-to-value ratios they are prepared to advance.The announcement that Firstplus plans to pull out of the market will leave just seven players offering home loans, down from 18 a year ago.Firstplus said it had taken steps to try to boost demand, including launching a new brand, Fair &amp;amp; Square, which aimed to make the product more transparent.It also tried to target a new group of consumers by advertising on mainstream channels and during prime-time television, whereas Firstplus had typically run adverts fronted by Carol Vorderman, whose contract with the group expired last month, on daytime shows.Other innovations included offering lower interest rates for an introductory period. But the group said demand for the product was simply not there, leading to the decision to stop writing new business.Plaid AM Chris Franks said: This is more bad news with potential redundancies at AB Automotives Cardiff plant. I hope that the management of Barclays will work with unions and the Assembly Government to see whether employees are able to find alternative work. Meanwhile the news has already had implications elsewhere, with Flint-based price comparison website Moneysupermarket.com announcing yesterday that Firstplus decision to stop issuing new loans would affect its profits by as much as 5m. In a statement to the Stock Exchange, Moneysupermarket.com chief executive Simon Nixon, said: In our pre-close update we warned that trading in the loans and mortgages sector was extremely challenging. Over the coming days we will work to mitigate the impact of this on our business. Trading across the rest of our business remains in line with our expectations. Shares in Moneysupermarket.com yesterday fell by as much as 32%, to their lowest level since the companys flotation last year.
