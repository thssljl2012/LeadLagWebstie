Resources stocks and companies in related industries have mainly driven the market, but recently the miners have not been doing so well. There is increasing talk of a bubble in commodities, including oil.A summer fall in the oil price combined with a rising dollar would be good for large caps with big dollar earnings. It may also create the conditions for a rise in the S&amp;amp;P 500 in time for the US presidential elections, all of which would be good for our market.The market looks very cheap and we will look back on this as a great opportunity to buy selectively at low prices.
