 Royal Bank of Scotland has switched its attention to Commonwealth Bank of Australia in its search for a buyer for ABN Amro's investment banking and corporate finance business in Asia.Discussions with National Australia Bank ended yesterday. Commonwealth Bank said its talks were exclusive but details of any deal were incomplete.The sale is part of RBS's drive to shed assets, many of which it picked up after the 72 billion (57.1 billion) takeover of ABN led by the British bank with Fortis and Banco Santander.RBS last month sold its train-leasing unit for 3.6 billion to a group led by Aussie investment firm Babcock &amp;amp; Brown, and is looking for 7.5 billion for its insurance unit after Zurich Financial Services withdrew from the auction earlier this month.RBS pulled off Europe's biggest-ever rights issue last month, raising 12.3 billion, but is still looking for assets sales of 4 billion.Reader views (0)No comments have so far been submitted.Add your commentName:Your email address will not be publishedEmail:Town and country:Your comment:Terms and conditions make text area bigger You have  characters left.Remember me - this will save your name, location and email address for when you leave your next comment.Email me a link to these comments.
