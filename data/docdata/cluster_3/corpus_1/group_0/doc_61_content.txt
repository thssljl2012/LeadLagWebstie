 Chimaera Capital Ltd has approached three backers and other investors seeking a $25 million funding boost after Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) abandoned its proposed $55 million bailout of the stock lender, reported the Sydney Morning HeraldThe financial services group said it had worked with other financiers to ensure 'there was no question' about its viability, and the business was not in any immediate financial difficulties as a result of ANZ's decision. Chimaera disputed that it ever required the $55 million funding proposed by ANZ, saying instead that it needed half that amount. 'As a business, we will still seek to undertake a smaller capital raising in order to demonstrate ongoing market confidence in our risk management systems and to fund expansion,' said the group. Chimaera announced its funding plans with ANZ in April amid rumours that its financial model was under pressure as other margin lenders, including Opes Prime and Lift Capital, hit the skids. But ANZ  on its proposed funding, releasing a two line statement saying 'ANZ today announced that following completion of the due diligence review, it has decided not to proceed with an investment in Chimaera Financial Group/Primebroker Securities Ltd,' the bank said. In response, a Chimaera spokesperson said 'we can only surmise that the bank's decision was a result of a strategic decision to exit the entire stock-lending area.'
