 THE CHIEF executive of Westpac, Gail Kelly, has dipped into her 10-year stint at the Commonwealth Bank and St George to come up with a 'back to the future' managerial revamp of her new employer.In an overhaul of her 12-strong senior executive team, Ms Kelly has combined Westpac's previously separate retail and business banking operations into one over-arching operation, with the stated ambition of trying to deliver a better deal for the bank's small-business customers.The move is a tacit admission the bank has a delivered a less-than-acceptable service for companies whose revenues total less than a $1 million a year but which are among the biggest drivers of the economy.In doing so, Ms Kelly has borrowed from her four years at CommBank - where she was a senior executive after arriving from South Africa in 1997 - and her time at St George - where she was chief executive until being made head of Westpac last year.CommBank's retail banking arm deals with the customers now being targeted by Westpac, while Ms Kelly's most recent employer has been hugely successful in capturing business from firms with turnover of more than $1 million but less so below that.Parts of yesterday's Westpac reorganisation mirrored an organisational shake-up of St George's retail banking, products, operations and technology businesses that Ms Kelly instituted in April last year.It also comes at a crucial time for Westpac, which is engaged in a $14 billion friendly bid for St George that would leapfrog the merged operation to the top of the banking league table.The restructuring - which will determine how Westpac is run for the next nine years, with or without St George - has, in effect, started the spill of senior managers which will accelerate after the merger in November.Ms Kelly has said the 'best of the best' from both banks will be appointed to the top jobs - prompting analysts yesterday to say the upheaval might cause uncertainty for staff and customers.One of the winners under Ms Kelly's strategy is her former right-hand man at St George, Peter Clare. He came in 14 weeks ago to head Westpac's branch network and call-centre division, and will now run its new product development and operational arm. Another key appointee is Peter Hanlon, the previous boss of business banking, who also takes on Mr Clare's frontline retail business responsibilities.The new 'super-size' division will generate more than half of Westpac's annual profits - which last year topped $3.45 billion - and dwarf the next biggest performer, its institutional bank.
