 The Capital Market Development Taskforce announced this week by Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel should take a hard look at regulation and how investors can be provided with a greater sense of security.It remains to be seen whether the taskforce will spark the constructive 'national conversation' that NZX chief executive and taskforce member Mark Weldon is hoping for.There is already a pretty widespread national conversation about the capital market, comprising finance companies and their debentures, and it's not a very positive one.It's likely that many of those with cash tied up in gutshot finance companies chose to invest in them because they remembered the 1987 crash and didn't feel safe investing in shares.The Feltex debacle which, like the finance company problems, mostly hit retail investors, will have also undermined their confidence in the sharemarket.KiwiSaver sidesteps some of those fears. It's safe to assume many who are now signed up, whether deliberately or as a result of the inertia the scheme cunningly relies on, don't even know they're investing in shares.A local market watcher at one of the big investment banks believes whether they take an active interest or not, New Zealanders will feel a lot more comfortable about the sharemarket if they believe it is well regulated. In particular, the taskforce should be taking a good hard look at the regulation of fund managers, who are going to end up with so much of New Zealanders' money within a few years.As Stock Takes has noted, some commentators say what amounts to market manipulation by fund managers continues to happen on the New Zealand market. The market watcher is concerned the lack of standards for portfolio managers is creating the potential for a future finance company sector-style meltdown.The need for tougher regulation of the sector was recognised quite a few years ago, yet was implemented far too slowly to prevent big losses for investors.With so many hopes pinned to KiwiSaver by the Government, capital market professionals, and investors themselves, this is surely an area we need to get right.Given the taskforce's pedigree, particularly that of chairman Rob Cameron, it seems inevitable that at least the partial float of state-owned enterprises will feature in the blueprint or action plan it will come up with.However, the presence of Gareth Morgan, a long time critic of sharp practices in the funds management industry, should give some hope that investor protection measures that will inspire confidence in the market will receive some attention. ABN MOVES Commonwealth Bank of Australia this week confirmed it was in the final stages of negotiating the purchase of ABN Amro's Australasian operations, including its New Zealand wholesale corporate and investment banking operations and Tauranga-based retail joint venture ABN Amro Craigs.
