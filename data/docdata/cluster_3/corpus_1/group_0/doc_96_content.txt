 A syndicate of banks and investment firms has taken a majority stake in Anglian Home Improvements in exchange for reducing the company's debt by 90m.Anglian Group chief executive Peter Mottershead will remain in post and said the change would put the company in a stronger position to withstand the economic environ-ment.The change of ownership comes as the company continues its efforts to trim costs.The firm announced in February that it would close its plant in Rochdale at a cost of 165 jobs and consolidate its manufacturing operation in Norwich.The efforts to reduce costs also saw the closure of two depots around the country and a decision to scale back its fitting operation and take about 100 of the company's 1,000-strong fleet of vans off the road.The syndicate of new owners includes Banc of America Securities, Bank of Scotland, Barclays, BlueBay Investments, Lloyds TSB and the Royal Bank of Scotland.Anglian has a turnover of 292m and employs 4,700 people nationwide, including 1,000 at its factory in Norwich.The venture capital group Alchemy Partners, which took the business off the stock exchange in 2001, will retain a minority stake in the business.Mr Mottershead took charge of the 40-year-old company - the UK's largest home improvements business - in March this year after the departure of Alex McNutt, who had been chief executive for two years.Mr Mottershead said: As a result of this change in ownership and the debt refinancing, the company is in a stronger position to withstand the current economic environment.Together with many other companies, the business has been impacted by the current economic environment and, as any well- managed business has to do, is undertaking an extensive cost restructuring programme that has so far included depot closures and the consolidation of a manufacturing facility in Rochdale into the company's Norwich operations.
