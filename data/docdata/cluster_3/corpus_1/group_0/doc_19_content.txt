 National Australia Bank incoming chief executive Cameron Clyne says he is looking forward to his new role.This morning NAB announced that Mr Clyne - who is head of the bank's New Zealand business - will take over from John Stewart in January.The move comes less than a week after the bank announced a shock writedown of nearly $1 billion from losses on risky investments in the United States.Mr Clyne says he is excited about working with Mr Stewart and other executives in the transition period. 'We've got a great team here, it's a fantastic benchstream for this organisation and I'll be calling on them to help me as well develop the plans for the future,' he said. 'So really I'm looking forward to a very exciting future for the group.' Earlier, speaking to ABC Newsradio, NAB spokeswoman Felicity Glennie-Holmes denied that Mr Stewart was going now because of the huge writedowns. 'We can understand that this announcement will be the subject of that sort of intense scrutiny but in fact the two events are unrelated,' she said. 'The board's been preparing for this event for over 18 months, the transition and the handover, and had the intention to make the decision at this week's board meeting.'
