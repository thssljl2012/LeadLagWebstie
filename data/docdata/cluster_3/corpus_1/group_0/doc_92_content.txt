 THE deals market in Yorkshire this year is outperforming last year with 1bn of transactions completed in the first six months compared to 800m for the same period in 2007, according to the latest research.Despite the tightening markets caused by the credit crunch, statistics from the Centre for Management Buy-out Research, founded by business advisory firm Deloitte and Barclays Private Equity, show that corporate finance activity has remained resilient in the region.The Yorkshire buyout market is currently outperforming in the over-100m range which is good news however we have seen a material fall in the level of completed deals in the mid market but most particularly in the 25m to 100m segment, said Martin Jenkins, partner and head of corporate finance at Deloitte in Leeds.In the first six months of 2008 there were 36 management buyouts (MBOs) or management buy-ins (MBIs), with three deals worth more than 100m and 33 at less than 25m, including five worth over 10m.There were no deals completed in the 25m to 100m range, which compares to 2007 where this segment of the mid-market was very strong with 10 deals completed worth over 435m during the year.It was, however, the first three months that saw the most activity in the market which hit the 767m mark, making for an exceptional start to the year compared to 2007 and 2006.However, this was in part driven by the adverse changes on taper relief hitting entrepreneurs which came into force at the beginning of this tax year.Significant deals so far this year have included the secondary buyout of Tunstall Holdings, the acquisition of Ultralase by 3i and the acquisition of Lowell Group by Exponent, all in the first quarter.However the second half of the year has shown a strong start with the 1.1bn acquisition of Grimsby-based seafood firm Young's owner Foodvest by Lion Capital and the 162m public-to-private deal for Halifax software group SSP where management were backed by US private equity group Hellman &amp;amp; Friendman.On a national basis deals in the 100-500m range have finally bowed to the credit crunch and dropped to 3bn in 2008, compared with 7bn in the first half of 2007.The total size of the market in the first half of 2008 is 11bn, the lowest first six months since 2004.Mr Jenkins said: Good businesses with strong management teams are still bankable but in general fewer businesses are being put up for sale. Private vendors are understandably cautious about selling in the current climate particularly where there is not a necessity to sell.
