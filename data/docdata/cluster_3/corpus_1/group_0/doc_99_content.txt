 When it comes to running their own company, a survey of small business owners conducted by Barclays Local Business, suggests that that over a quarter (28%) expect to be in it for the long haul. They said more than 25 years, which is longer than the average marriage in the UK at 24 years, or 11.6 years if it ends in divorce. One in five said they plan to keep working well into their seventies.As well as being wedded to the job, small firm bosses are forming long-term and loyal relationships with their staff.Despite the popular belief that a 'job for life' is a thing of the past, nearly a third (29%) of those questioned have an employee on the books who has worked for them for at least 10 years and two-thirds of respondents still employ their first ever recruit.John Davis, marketing director for Barclays Local Business said: 'For every over night success there are thousands of business people who have spent years developing a successful business  but there are few things as satisfying as making it a success after all that effort.' It certainly seems to be an emotional attachment: two-fifths admit feeling personally connected to their business, and said its failure would cause emotions akin to a relationship ending.Although women were more likely to be affected by 'business bereavement' when a company failed, the survey showed that, when it comes to their staff, male entrepreneurs are more sentimental than their female counterparts.On average, male bosses employed their first recruit for approximately a year longer than female bosses, while their longest serving employees typically clocked up a year longer on the payroll.
