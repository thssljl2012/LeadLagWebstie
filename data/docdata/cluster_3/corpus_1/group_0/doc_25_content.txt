 Barclays Stockbrokers launched National Share Giving Day yesterday to mark the start of a new charity fundraising initiative with ShareGift. ShareGift collects unwanted shares that cost more to sell than they are worth, sells them and donates the proceeds to charities. It has given more than 12m to 1,500 charities since 1996.Barclays Stockbrokers is now offering investors who hold small or unwanted shares the chance to give them away through ShareGift. 'ShareGifts vision was to create a new funding stream for UK charities,' said Claire Mackintosh, chief executive and co-founder of ShareGift. 'Tiny unwanted parcels of shares can be a headache for companies and shareholders alike and ShareGift provides a charitable solution to this international problem.'
