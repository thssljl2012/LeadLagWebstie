 National Australia Bank (AU:NAB: news, chart, profile) (NABZY:NABZYNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) said in a brief statement that it's negotiating to acquire the regional investment banking and wholesale banking operations of ABN Amro, which RBS (UK:RBS: news, chart, profile) (RBS:RBSNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) acquired as part of a consortium takeover of ABN. The announcement came after Switzerland's Zurich Financial (CH:001107539: news, chart, profile) said late Thursday that it was no longer interested in acquiring the RBS insurance division, which includes the Direct Line and Churchill car insurance businesses. Zurich had been a front-runner to buy the unit, which RBS put up for sale in April as part of a plan to strengthen its balance sheet by selling units and issuing more shares.  But instead, Zurich said Friday it would acquire a 50% stake in the insurance operations of Spain's Banco Sabadell (BNDSF:BNDSFNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) in a deal worth up to 900 million euros ($1.42 billion). The deal will make Zurich the second-largest insurance group in Spain measured by total premiums. Shares in RBS sank 2.4% on the news, while Zurich shares jumped 6.8%. Shares in National Australia Bank fell 0.6% in Sydney, in line with a wider decline for the banking sector. RBS has struggled to overcome significant write-downs in the credit crisis and needs to raise cash to balance those losses along with the impact of the acquisition of ABN Amro. The bank hopes to add around 4 billion pounds to its core capital from the sale of its insurance arm and other assets, possibly including Angel Trains, its train leasing company. That's on top of the 12 billion rights issue it announced in April. Fortis, another member of the consortium that acquired ABN Amro, has also had to raise capital and scrap its dividend following the deal. Fortis' board is meeting Friday to discuss shareholder anger over its plans amid reports that CEO Jean-Paul Votron may be forced to resign.  LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Royal Bank of Scotland is in talks to sell operations in Australia and New Zealand to National Australia Bank it emerged Friday, helping to partially offset the news that Zurich Financial has dropped its interest in the group's U.K. insurance arm.
