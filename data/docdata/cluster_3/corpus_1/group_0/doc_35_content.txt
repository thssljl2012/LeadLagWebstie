 SHARES in the UKs biggest mortgage lender soared yesterday amid rumours of a possible takeover approach from Spanish bank BBVA.The speculation over HBOS sent its shares up nearly 17% to 305p. This came after its 4billion rights issue flopped, leaving underwriters Morgan Stanley and Dresdner Kleinwort with about 2.6billion in new shares snubbed by investors. The talk moved HBOS to well above the 275p price at which the new shares were being offered to shareholders to shore up its finances. Only 8% of investors bought the new stock as shares were trading below the discounted rights issue price. Spains second biggest bank, serves 35million customers but is focused on the Spanish and Latin American markets. It has been present in London since 1918 but has only three branches in the capital.Both HBOS and BBVA declined to comment on market speculation. At Tuesdays prices BBVA had a market valuation about 2.5 times that of HBOS.The rumoured interest comes a week after fellow Spanish banking giant and Abbey owner Santander agreed a deal to buy mortgage lender Alliance and Leicester for 1.26billion.Meanwhile, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) now appears to be the front-runner to buy ABN Amros operations in Australia and New Zealand from the Royal Bank of Scotland.RBS led a consortium which acquired Dutch rival ABN Amro last year, but is seeking to sell assets to shore up its balance sheet, hit by the size of the 49billion acquisition and also by the sub-prime loans crisis. National Australia Bank pulled out of a possible offer earlier this week, and CBA is reported to have gained a period of exclusivity on negotiations.RBS shares added 22.25p at 221.25p, while Barclays was up 37.25p to 352p and Lloyds TSB rose 26.5p to 346.5p.
