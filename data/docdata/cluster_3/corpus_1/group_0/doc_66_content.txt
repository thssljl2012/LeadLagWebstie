 MADRID -Four small bombs exploded at popular seaside resorts in Cantabria, northern Spain, yesterday, after warning calls from the Basque separatist group ETA and an explosion outside a Barclays bank near Bilbao. One woman was hurt by a flying stone and another treated for shock. The attacks marked the beginning of ETA's traditional summer bombing campaign, which targets holiday resorts as part of the group's four-decade struggle for an independent Basque state. Many European schools have begun their summer holidays and the attacks are meant to hurt tourism, one of Spain's biggest foreign income earners. Spain's Socialist government says ETA has been weakened by a string of arrests.
