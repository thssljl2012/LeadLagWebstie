 :54am  HBOS, the UK owner of Perth-based BankWest, today said shareholders agreed to take up 8.29 per cent of its 4 billion ($8.2 billion), increasing speculation that Perth-based BankWest could be up for sale. In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, shareholders accepted just over 124 million shares prices at 275 pence each, leaving underwriters Morgan Stanley and Dresdner Kleinwort to seek buyers for the remaining 1.38 billion shares. HBOS said the underwriters will have until tomorrow afternoon, London time, to procure subscribers for the shares. '.. the underwriters will not be obliged to endeavour to procure subscribers if, at any time prior to 4:30 p.m. on 22 July 2008, they are of the opinion that it is unlikely that any such subscribers can be procured at a price per New Share which is at least equal to the aggregate of the Issue Price of 275 pence per New Share and the expenses of procuring subscribers,' HBOS said in the statement. The unsuccessful take up of the rights issue has prompted speculation that HBOS may be forced to sell BankWest to boost its financial position, with several Australian banks including the National Australia Bank looking like potential bidders.
