Addressing a business group in Wisconsin, the Republican presidential hopeful said the Fed should get back to what he called 'its core business of responsibly managing our money supply and inflation.' The Fed engineered an $85 billion takeover of insurance giant AIG this week, one of a series of failures of major financial companies that have rocked Wall Street. The government seized control of housing giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae earlier this month. The Arizona senator reiterated his call to fire SEC chairman Chris Cox, saying there needed to be greater accountability in Washington. He also hit Democratic rival Barack Obama for ties to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. McCain noted Fannie Mae's former CEO, Jim Johnson, once headed Obama's vice presidential search committee and that the Illinois senator had received large campaign contributions from both agencies. 'Maybe just this once he could spare us the lectures, and admit to his own poor judgment in contributing to these problems,' McCain said of Obama.
