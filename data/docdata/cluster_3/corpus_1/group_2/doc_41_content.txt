Washington: The debate surrounding the US government using taxpayer money to bail out companies that have made poor choices has raised many eyebrows.Sources state that if the government doesn't help AIG, it could affect tens or even hundreds of millions of people.The Federal Reserve Bank is giving 85-billion dollars American International Group (AIG)to help keep it afloat. In return, the government will take over about 80 per cent of AIG.AIG is the largest insurance company in the country, with more than a trillion dollars in assets. If AIG fails, it could cause markets around the world to nose-dive, since AIG has 74 million clients spread over 130 countries.Republican Mitt Romney says his party's presidential candidate John McCain believes that when the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have evaluated a particular enterprise and conclude that its failure will hurt more people in this country than the bailout would cost, why then, of course, the right course is to help those enterprises stay alive.Prominent members of both parties are calling for better financial industry regulation.Democrats, including Presidential candidate Barack Obama and house speaker Nancy Pelosi, blame the Bush administration.Pelosi says that Bush administration had refused to regulate an industry where apparently all of the gain was privatized and all of the risk was nationalized and she just didnt think that was a fair deal for the American people.Democrat or Republican, one thing is likely, soon, Americans tax dollars will be bailing out AIG.
