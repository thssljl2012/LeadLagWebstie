The move will leave AIG under government control. The existing management team will be replaced by government appointed representatives. The $85bn loan is designed to keep the company afloat until the company can arrange the sale of assets to repay it. Interest will accrue on the outstanding balance at 3m libor plus 8.5%. This suggests the group is unlikely to survive as a going concern and the Fed envisages an orderly liquidation. The Feds statement said that it had acted because a failure of AIG would: Add to already significant levels of financial market fragility and lead to substantially higher borrowing costs, reduced household wealth and materially weaker economic performance.  Separately, Barclays has also agreed to buy Lehman Brothers North American investment banking and capital markets operations. The group said the acquisition would create a global bulge bracket investment banking company with a leading presence in all major markets and across all major lines of business. Barclays will acquire trading assets with a current estimated value of 40bn and trading liabilities with a current estimated value of 38bn for a cash consideration of 0.14bn. The group added that certain shareholders had expressed an interest in upping their stake as a result of the deal and this was likely to lead to a subscription of at least 0.6bn of additional equity. It will be difficult to know whether Barclays has got a bargain until Lehmans trading liabilities are confirmed. However, it is undoubtedly better to buy now than at the top of the market. Expanding an investment banking operation just as long-standing investment banks are wondering whether they can survive as independent entities is bullish, but Bob Diamond, head of Barclays Capital, has always been an optimist.
