Is it time for the government to help out Lehman Brothers?10 Sep 2008Markets wipe almost 40% off Lehman as KDB talks collapse09 Sep 2008Comment: Freaking out about Lehman09 Sep 2008Options trading on Lehman surges09 Sep 2008Now Lehman Brothers has finally confirmed the rumors that it is putting up for sale a controlling stake in its investment management division, principally its wealth management unit Neuberger Berman, bankers are rushing to get in touch with likely buyers.Bankers say private equity firms seem to be the only players in town at the moment, despite their supposed difficulties raising debt finance. Buyout firms TA Associates, Carlyle, Blackstone Group and Fortress each have the cash, know-how and appetite for a deal and are thought of as likely contenders.Friedman Fleischer &amp;amp; Loweis seen as a strong possibility, Cerberus a weak one. Hellman &amp;amp; Friedman has investments in asset management and is seen as having an appetite, but since it likes to invest less than $750m (530m) in deals, and Neuberger is thought to be worth anything from $5bn to $10bn, it would have to join a consortium.KKRhas been touted in the media but bankers are not so sure, pointing out that KKR is almost always mentioned whenever a big deal is afoot. Madison Dearborn is thought to be out, on the grounds that it bought Nuveen Investments for $6bn only last year.Rival asset management companies are not featuring strongly on bankers' lists of potential buyers. They can just about see BlackRock as as runner, having successfully digested Merrill Lynch Investment Managers and being interested in hearing from bankers. But the fact that its largest shareholder is Merrill Lynch, which like Lehman Brothers has suffered from sub-prime related investments, has given bankers pause. They put Legg Mason, which has struggled with Citigroup Asset Management, and Franklin Templeton well out of the frame.Bankers might do well to look further afield.Neuberger is seen as a jewel of a wealth management business and any rival wanting to expand in the US has got to take a serious look at it. Barclays Wealth and Wells Fargo will probably be top of that list with Socit Gnrale not far behind.Lehman has excluded from the deal its middle market institutional asset management distribution business and the firm's minority stakes in external hedge funds, including GLG Partners, DE Shaw, Spinnaker, Marble Bar and Ospraie.The hedge fund management stakes are not strategic and would seem like an obvious set of assets to sell, either together or piecemeal, but with hedge fund returns down and the likelihood rising that the hedge fund industry will suffer net redemptions, this does not seem like a propitious moment for a sale.
