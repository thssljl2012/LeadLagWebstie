A bankruptcy judge in New York has given Lehman Brothers initial approval to sell its key North American businesses to Barclays for 940m in cash.The approval comes just two days after Lehman Brothers filed the biggest bankruptcy in US history.The judge's approval sets in motion the asset sales but leaves open the possibility of a competing bid. Lehman plans to seek final court approval on Friday.Barclays said it would buy Lehman's investment banking and capital markets businesses for 138.9m in cash, as well as Lehman's New York headquarters and two data centres in New Jersey for an additional 830m.Lawyers for creditors and bondholders objected to the speed of the process, saying two days was not enough time to evaluate the deal, much less put together a competing bid.But Judge James Peck refused to delay the approval of the bidding process and said: 'There is effectively one logical purchaser for these assets.'That purchaser has already identified itself, has been identified publicly to the markets, has been identified publicly to the employees and represents the continuity for this operation.'Lawyers for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Securities and Exchange Commission and JPMorgan -- which believes it could be the company's biggest creditor -- backed the sale effort.The judge also approved Lehman Brothers' request for a 55.6m break-up fee plus 13.9m in expenses to be paid to Barclays if the deal failed and a competitor won out.Editor's ChoiceA BROADWAY woman who is trekking across the Sahara Desert for charity is boosting her fundraising efforts with an auction.THE demolition of Eckington Recreation Centre began on Monday (21) paving the way for work to begin on its 80,000 replacement.THE government's decision to give surrounding areas more flood recovery cash than Gloucestershire has been labelled 'a shame' by a North Cotswold civic leader.A COTSWOLDS huntsman, who is being prosecuted for hunting foxes since the ban was imposed, is to appear at Cheltenham Magistrates Court next month.Amanda Holden is to front an ITV1 show which makes people's dreams come true.Gordon Brown has hailed a march of hundreds of the world's religious leaders, calling for urgent action to tackle global poverty, as 'the greatest public demonstration of faith' Britain has ever seen.
