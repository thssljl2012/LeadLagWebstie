The UK government will act to protect Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley customers, said chief whip Geoff Hoon amid reports that Britain's biggest lender to landlords will be taken over by the state.Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling 'have worked right through this weekend to sort out the problems we're facing,' Hoon said yesterday.The government will take control of Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley, whose shares have tumbled 93 percent this year, the BBC reported.The Treasury and Financial Services Authority will negotiate with banks interested in buying parts of the lender.Possible buyers include Banco Santander, HSBC Holdings (0005) and Barclays, the report said.'It was inevitable that nationalization has been decided as the risk has been too great,' said Howard Wheeldon, a senior strategist at BGC Partners in London. 'It's a very sensible solution.'A spokesman for the Treasury said discussions about Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley are 'ongoing.'An announcement about the company's future will be made before London markets open today.The impending nationalization of Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley would follow Northern Rock's in February and a government-assisted takeover of HBOS, as banks struggle with funding amid the seizure of credit markets.Separately, Washington Mutual Inc, a holding company for the biggest US bank to fail, listed more than US$8 billion (HK$62.4 billion) in debt in its bankruptcy filing.Washington Mutual, the 119-year- old bank, sought Chapter 11 protection in US Bankruptcy Court late Friday. The filing covered the bank's holding company and its WMI Investment Corp unit.
