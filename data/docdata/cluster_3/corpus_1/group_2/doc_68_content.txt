Lloyds TSB has been told by its workers to cease and reverse its use of offshore outsourcing. The move would compensate for job losses following the , Lloyds TSB Group Union said yesterday. Rather than making the jobs of existing staff redundant, the Lloyds TSB Board should put an immediate halt to transferring jobs to India and return jobs to the UK for those staff that it currently employs itself, said LTU assistant general secretary Steve Tatlow.Lloyds TSB has around 3,000 IT and back office jobs in India. The union says that repatriating those jobs would save the organisation 1 billion in redundancy payments by 2011.It added that, as the merged bank will be the largest financial services organisation in the country, it has an obligation to support the employment market. If the new bank is to be so dominant in the UK, it is imperative that it commits itself to supporting UK customers only from the UK, said Tatlow. Clearly, it is early days, and we have not had the chance to work out the details. Jobs are, however, important to us across the UK, Amanda Glover of Lloyds TSB group media relations told reporters. We have a strong track history of being concerned about the well-being of our staff because we are a people business.
