The deal includes the failed firm's equities and investment banking operations across Asia, but doesn't include any of its balance sheet, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter. Lehman (LEHMQ:LEHMQNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) employs almost 3,000 people across the region. Nomura (NMR:NMRNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) (JP:8604: news, chart, profile) is also reportedly in talks to acquire some of Lehman's European operations. Shares in Nomura rose almost 10% in Tokyo as banking stocks rallied across Asia.  The agreement follows the sale of Lehman's core U.S. operations and headquarters to Barclays (UK:BARC: news, chart, profile) (BCS:BCSNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) for around $1.55 billion. The Barclays deal was approved by a U.S. bankruptcy court on Saturday, but not without opposition from some clients and employees, who say they are owed money and have queried the way Lehman moved assets between London and New York shortly before it filed for bankruptcy. PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is overseeing the insolvency of Lehman in Europe said an initial inquiry found substantial transfers of securities out of the European operations, which need to be investigated further, the Journal reported. PwC said it had identified more than $8 billion of funds due to the European unit and that it's possible further transfers will be discovered, the report added. One of the clients claiming funds had been improperly transferred is U.K. hedge fund GLG Partners, which had used Lehman as its prime broker in recent years and holds significant claims against the firm's European operations, the Journal said. LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Japan's Nomura Holdings has agreed to buy the Asian operations of bankrupt U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers for $225 million, according to a published report Monday.
