A TUG of love for Lehman Brothers staff between Japanese investment bank Nomura and a host of potential new employers is underway, as the City homes in on a raft of talented Lehman employees ready to jump ship.A source close to talks over the future of Lehman Brothers staff told City A.M. that Nomura, which wrapped up a deal for Lehmans investment banking and equities units for $2 yesterday, was looking to coax staff into staying with a generous bonus package.The source said that 500 of 700 employees at the London investment banking operation would be retained and would be offered a two-year cash bonus guarantee at 2007 levels. A similar proportion would be retained at the equities division  which employs 780 people  and would receive the same bonus guarantees, they added.Japans largest investment bank has ringfenced a 1bn bonus pool to entice key staff members to stay on at the surviving units of the bank, whose major players were once dubbed the Masters of the Universe.The source also said that Nomura was putting together a bid for Lehmans fixed income business, raising the prospect that even more London jobs will be saved. But some of Lehmans brightest talents have already been targeted by headhunters, as uncertainty reigns in the wake of the investment bank's collapse.Hilary Jackson, London region senior manager at Career Management Consultants (CMC), said that former Lehman stars are likely to be the subject of approaches from smaller institutions looking to capitalise on a wealth of experience.She said: Some of Lehmans top level employees will now be prime targets for smaller bespoke investment houses and the European banks, given the limited opportunities at the larger investment banks.Another recruitment consultant said that headhunters had moved into coffee bars and pubs in the immediate aftermath of Lehman Brothers failure, in the hope of hoovering up staff worried about their future. He added that a likely destination for top level staff was Barclays, which last week bought Lehmans US investment banking unit in a 2bn deal which included the banks New York headquarters.Barclays reopened the unit under the Barclays Capital banner on Monday and promised to employ 10,000 Lehman Brothers staff.Meanwhile, it emerged that the FBI is to investigate four major failed financial institutions, including Lehman Brothers, over allegations of corporate fraud.
