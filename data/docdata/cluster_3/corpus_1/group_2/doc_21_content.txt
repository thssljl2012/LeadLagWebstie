th 2008, 4:00 AM II suspect that, like most of us, you're wondering what the heck this $85 billion AIG bailout package is all about.Here are some quick answers.  is a massive insurance company that sells policies to all kinds of folks around the world, from homeowners to bond traders. But like Bear Stearns, Fannie and Freddie, and the late, lamented Lehman Brothers, it's also deep into financial services, and as such, owns much of the same troubled debt, like subprime mortgages, as these other firms do. To make a long, ugly story short, it's the combination of AIG's size, its toxic holdings and its role as an insurer that made this unfortunate bailout necessary. Were they to go bankrupt, they'd bring a whole lot of folks down with them. AIG is deeply interconnected to financial institutions across the globe. For example, it's got a huge business insuring the financial assets of banks here and abroad. If someone defaults on a debt, the party that holds that debt is out of luck, unless it has the type of debt insurance AIG provides. But what happens if AIG goes down? All of a sudden, every lending institution is dangerously exposed to precisely the type of losses that are bringing venerable institutions to their knees. The possibility of cascading failures is all too real. Sounds scary, but so what? A bunch of rich guys made some stupid bets. Why shouldn't they take their lumps? Because it wouldn't be just them. With a financial implosion of this size, all the current problems of the U.S. economy - job losses, tumbling home prices, frozen credit markets, recession - would likely be amplified. All of this should lead us to a very big question that's not getting enough play: What kind of economy is it where the huge firms get saved because 'they're too big to fail,' while the little guys and gals have to pick up the pieces when the big shots crap out? No firm should be too big to fail. We're paying the price for a clear lack of oversight by financial authorities that let this situation get to the point where the only choices are 'bad' or 'worse,' as in bailout or crash. For once, let's learn from our mistakes and implement common-sense regulations so that we're not stuck here again.Jared Bernstein is a senior economist at the  in Washington and the author of 'Crunch: Why Do I Feel So Squeezed?'
