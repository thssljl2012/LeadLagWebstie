The Scottish Parliament is to debate the HBOS takeover next week, an MSP has said.But parliamentary business managers rejected a plea from independent MSP Margo MacDonald for Holyrood to meet on Friday in emergency session.'They preferred to wait until next Wednesday to have a debate, when they felt they would have more information,' she said.'She went on: 'I think the parliamentary bureau is wrong.'I think that for Parliament to appear relevant to the real lives of the real people in the real world outside the Parliament, we should have shown more urgency in, for example, coming together as a Parliament to demand of Westminster, that at least the same action is taken against short-selling as has already been taken in America.'Her unsuccessful call for Holyrood to sit on Friday to debate the 12.2 billion takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB came as unions voiced fears for Scottish banking jobs as a result of the plans.Chancellor Alistair Darling said he had raised his concerns over jobs in Edinburgh, and declared: 'I very much want a very significant presence to remain there.'Ms MacDonald had called for an emergency session in a letter to the Presiding Officer Alex Fergusson, which said: 'The elimination of the Bank of Scotland, one of the main pillars of the hitherto successful Scottish financial services industry, is a matter of extraordinary importance to the Scottish economy.'
