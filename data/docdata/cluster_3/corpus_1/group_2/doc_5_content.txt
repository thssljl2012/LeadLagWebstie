LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays said on Tuesday that it is in talks with Lehman Brothers Holdings regarding a possible acquisition of certain assets.Barclays said any deal would need to be attractive to its shareholders and no assurances could be made that talks will lead to an agreement.A deal could be struck as early as Tuesday, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal after Lehman's holding company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday having failed to find a buyer over the weekend.A source told Reuters on Monday the bank had pulled out of bidding for the whole of Lehman because a deal would have required it to guarantee the investment bank's trading obligations.Barclays said a further announcement will be made 'in due course'.(Reporting by Lorraine Turner; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
