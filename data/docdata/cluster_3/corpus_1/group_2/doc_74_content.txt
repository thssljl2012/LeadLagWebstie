PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS confirmed that Lehman Brothers London investment bank division will be sold this week, in a move that could save a large number of its 5,000 Canary Wharf staff.Barclays, which has already acquired Lehmans US investment banking arm, has made an offer for the London division but faces competition from Japanese brokerage Nomura and French bank BNP.Lehmans administrator PwC said that it has received three credible bids for the division and will agree a deal as soon as possible to prevent further losses of customers and staff. Lehmans equity division has made record profits over the past five years and is expected to make healthy returns this year, despite the struggling market.Barclays chief executive John Varley said that he was looking seriously at other Lehman assets: We now have the opportunity to see what else might fit with the businesses were developing around the world.The Japanese press reported that Nomura is particularly interested in the M&amp;amp;A and stock trading divisions. The news came as Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that he was lobbying the US government to return $8bn (4.4m) from the failed investment bank to its staff in the UK.We are working with the American government to get that money back to pay salaries, not of high-flying financiers, but of cleaners and people who are computer operators who would otherwise be denied their money, said Brown at the Labour partys annual conference .Administrators for Lehmans European operations have questioned why $8bn was transferred to New York from London just before the bank collapsed.
