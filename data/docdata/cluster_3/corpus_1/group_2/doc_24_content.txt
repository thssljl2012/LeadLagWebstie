If Wall Street were to hold its own World Series of Poker -- and by the state of things, it probably would be a better way to raise cash than through the markets -- than Barclays' Bob Diamond would have to be favored over Bank of America's Ken Lewis.Diamond is the president of Barclays , head of its Barclays Capital investment-banking division and is said to be the one leading the talks to buy Lehman Brothers .On Tuesday, Barclays confirmed a report in The Wall Street Journal that it's still interested in buying Lehman assets, even after the bankruptcy. Certainly Barclays is in a stronger negotiating position and won't have to worry about counterparty risk or inheriting troublesome assets. And creditors are likely to take anything they can get. See story.Conversely, Lewis, chairman and chief executive of Bank of America , took the plunge over the weekend to buy Merrill Lynch .True, Merrill wasn't in as dire as position as Lehman Brothers, and had substantially more attractive assets. Lewis said he wanted to 'seize the opportunity' and certainly, buying Merrill is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Since it's an all-stock deal, whatever woe Bank of America suffers is immediately taken off the transaction price. The prospect of another bank, say HSBC Holdings , coming in and swooping for Merrill appears low. On the other hand, were Lewis to have waited even a day, Merrill could have been had for a fraction of the $22.82 a share now on offer, using Monday's closing price.Ten dollars per Merrill share less equates to about $15 billion, money that could come in handy given the mortgage and other risky positions held by Bank of America, Merrill, and lest we forget, Countrywide.That's not to say that Bank of America made a bad decision. It's just that Lewis may have flinched a bit quickly.-- Steve Goldstein
