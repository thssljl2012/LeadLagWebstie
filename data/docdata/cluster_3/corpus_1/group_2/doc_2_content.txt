 San Francisco workers face uncertainty in the unprecedented financial market shake-up that has driven the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the fire sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America, and the frantic restructuring of AIG Insurance.Taken together, the firms including the Merrill Lynch-owned First Republic Bank lease nearly 600,000 square feet in downtown San Francisco. Much of that space could be put up for sublease or not renewed in the next 12 months, spiking the amount of sublease space available and driving down leasing rates.Lehman Brothers (NYSE: LEH), which filed for bankruptcy protection, has two floors at 555 California St., floors 30 and 41. Merrill Lynch occupies 100,000 square feet at 101 California St., occupying floors 9, 11-14, 20-21, and 24, according to Colliers International. Merrill Lynch (NYSE: MER) also has 42,000 square feet at 600 California St. Once the Bank of America takeover is complete, Merrill Lynch workers could be absorbed into the 800,000 square feet the bank leases at 555 California St., 600 Montgomery St., and 345 Montgomery St.AIG Insurance (NYSE: AIG) also has a major presence in San Francisco, with more than 800 employees. AIG leases 160,000 square feet at 121 Spear St. and 42,000 square feet at 101 Spear St. New York is a leading indicator of what is going to happen here, said Kevin Brennan, co-branch manager of the San Francisco office of Studley. There is going to be a larger financial services fallout in San Francisco, which will directly impact the legal services. There should be more downsizing in most sectors. Its far from over, and its going to manifest in our world over the next year or so. In particular, the demise of investment banks Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch will impact the top-tier rents in marquee buildings. The investment banks, along with hedge funds and private equity groups, have generally occupied the most expensive office space in the city. With the number of investment banks suddenly cut in half, office building owners may face less demand for top view space.Merrill Lynch-owned First Republic Bank leases 165,000 square feet in the city and employs some 600 workers. The bank has 110,000 square feet at 111 Pine St. and 55,000 square feet at 388 Market St.
