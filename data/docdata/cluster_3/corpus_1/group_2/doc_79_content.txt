HBOS is shedding 118 jobs at two sites, according to a trade union.The cutbacks at the Cardiff Bay and Cardiff Gate Business Park operations are not being linked to the merger with Lloyds TSB, said Ged Nichols, general secretary of the Accord union.He said the jobs were going because of a reduction in the firms credit card and loans business during the current economic downturn.The news was another blow for HBOS workers in the Welsh capital after the company announced last month it was closing its mortgage processing centre with the loss of 150 jobs.The redundancies follow confirmation that the bank is to close its Cardiff mortgage service centre, which employs 151 staff. HBOS would not confirm how many jobs would be lost at its operation at Cardiff Gate.HBOS employs more than 65,000 people in the UK  out of a global total of 75,000. Around 17,000 staff are in Scotland. The company could not confirm how many people it employs in Wales.The group has about 1,100 branches around the UK  including 320 in Scotland  with its three main UK bases in Edinburgh, Halifax and Bristol. HBOS suitor, Lloyds TSB has around 80 branches in Wales, employing more than 1,300 staff.A statement from HBOS said: HBOS is making some changes within its Card and Loans structure to deliver a simpler and more streamlined service for customers. This involves bringing together common teams and streamlining processes. Our priorities remain unchanged  delivering value for money products for customers in an efficient way. As a result of these changes, some 100 roles will be impacted over the coming months.
