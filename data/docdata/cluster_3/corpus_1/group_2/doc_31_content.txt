Barclays had been the front-runner to bail out the ailing firm, but the UK bank walked after failing to obtain guarantees over Lehman's financial commitments, a source close to the negotiations said. A consortium led by Bank of America (BoA) followed soon after, leaving the likely prospect that Lehman would have to file for insolvency. The US Federal Reserve had been hosting emergency talks with banks in a bid to save Lehman. Negotiations entered a third consecutive day in New York as officials battled to secure a deal, but with only hours to go Barclays walked from the table. A source close to the talks said: 'It was clear from the start that Barclays were interested providing a number of conditions were met. 'This included the spinning off of so-called bad bank assets and having in place some form of guarantees over Lehman's obligations.' Barclays' decision severely narrows the options left for US Treasury and Fed officials. All it appears to leave was a potential bid by a consortium led by Bank of America, who had reportedly teamed up with private equity firm JC Flowers &amp;amp; Co and Chinese sovereign wealth fund China Investment Co. But talks with the consortium also broke down. It is thought that this too could have been scuppered by the refusal of US Government financial help to tidy up Lehman's battered balance sheet.One of the world's largest investment banks appears to be on the brink of collapse after talks to secure a rescue deal for Lehman Brothers broke down.
