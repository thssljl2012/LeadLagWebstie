HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby has admitted he did not know what role he would have in the banking mammoth to be created from the 30 billion Lloyds TSB takeover. Mr Hornby also said it was 'very unlikely' any other bidder would appear on the horizon.This would appear to offer little support for SNP MSP Alex Neil, who wants to persuade elders of the banking community to buy out the Bank of Scotland part of HBOS before it merges with Lloyds TSB.Mr Hornby's comments came in a Scottish Press Association interview in which he insisted the Lloyds TSB takeover would create a financial 'powerhouse'.But asked if he knew what role he would have in the new set-up, he replied: 'I don't know.'What has been made clear, very kindly, by their management is they are keen to have me in a senior role on the board. Obviously we will move on from there.'Mr Hornby refused to give public backing to the view of SNP First Minister Alex Salmond that HBOS had been laid low by short-selling 'spivs and speculators'.'I'm not going to get drawn into criticising a set of people, I think that would be wrong,' he said. 'All I would say is in the circumstances a combination of trading patterns and the concern at the macroeconomic events meant the share prices were so volatile that it made sense for us to complete the deal as quickly as possible.'Talks between the two institutions began some weeks ago but the pace accelerated 'hugely' with last week's events.Asked about prospect of any other outcome but the Lloyds TSB takeover, he said: 'Put it this way - as long as it gets shareholder approval, this deal should move on to completion.'Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.
