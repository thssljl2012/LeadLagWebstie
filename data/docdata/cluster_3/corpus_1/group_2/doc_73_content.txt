Finance and industry leaders will spell out the impact of the credit crunch on key sectors of the economy in Parliament.Holyrood's economy committee will gauge views on the impact of the global turmoil, particularly on the banking and housing sectors in Scotland.It comes with the former Bank of Scotland, now HBOS, set to be taken over by Lloyds TSB after the share price of HBOS plummeted last week.However, a call for a joint inquiry into the takeover of Halifax Bank of Scotland, which employs thousands in Edinburgh, is to be made by the Scottish Lib Dems.Party leader Tavish Scott will claim the plan throws up 'significant' issues crossing the boundary between the Holyrood and Westminster governments.In recent days the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the European Commission, and the Confederation of British Industry have all revised their forecasts and are predicting that the UK economy will fall into recession in the second half of this year.Scottish house prices continue to rise, according to Government figures in the year to June, although Nationwide and Halifax both indicate that Scottish house prices are falling. Prices are falling throughout the UK as a whole.Graeme Dalziel, chief executive of Dunfermline Building Society, will give evidence, as will Eric Leenders, executive director of the British Bankers' Association, and John Gill from Standard Life.Michael Levack, chief executive of the Scottish Building Federation, will also appear before the committee along with representatives of both the Glasgow and Edinburgh Solicitors' Property Centre.Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.
