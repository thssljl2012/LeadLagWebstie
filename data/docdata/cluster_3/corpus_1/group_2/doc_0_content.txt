The AIG bail-out represents a stunning turnaround by the Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke.Their insistence that no more government money should go towards rescuing Wall Street firms lasted four days: long enough to force Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy, send Merrill Lynch into the arms of Bank of America, and, it now appears, long enough to give Bernanke and Paulson a glimpse of what might unfold if AIG were also allowed to fail.They obviously didn't like what they saw: AIG is a $US1 trillion octopus with tentacles that reach not only into the most infected part of the markets through its credit insurance activities, but directly into the US economy itself, through AIG's more prosaic insurance activities.So AIG has joined Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Britain's Northern Rock bank, an earlier casualty, on a list of companies nationalised by their governments to avoid a panic.The Fed has driven what would normally be called a tough deal: it will advance $US85 billion to AIG over two years at usurious interest rates and get an 80 per cent shareholding in the company in return, as well as board and management control, as AIG's businesses are carved up and sold off.This capital injection is unprecedented, and it forms part of Paulson and Bernanke's Plan C (or is it D, E or F?), which prefers direct injections of cash into the markets and specific problem companies rather than rate cuts.Groups including Citigroup and UBS were expecting a half a percentage point rate cut from the Fed on Tuesday night our time. Instead, they got word that the government was back in the bail-out business at AIG - that turned the market around - and a $US50 billion ($63 billion) liquidity injection from the Fed that was part of a co-ordinated global central bank flood of money that had surpassed $US200 billion by yesterday afternoon, including a net addition of $A2.1 billion yesterday from our Reserve Bank.There's two ways of looking at this: One is that Paulson and Bernanke have blinked and shouldn't have: that the AIG rescue, the biggest government bail-out of a financial institution in history, creates enormous moral hazard and ensures that the line of former masters of the universe seeking similar bail-outs will now stretch all the way from the Fed's New York headquarters in downtown Manhattan to Central Park.Washington Mutual, a home lender with assets of over $US300 billion, will be at the front of the line, cup in hand.
