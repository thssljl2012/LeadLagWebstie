Troubled banking group Halifax Bank of Scotland, which employs thousands of people in Yorkshire, has confirmed it is in 'advanced talks' over a potential takeover by rival Lloyds TSB.Such a move would create a mortgage and savings giant with more than 330bn of mortgages and 300bn of deposits. It is thought the Government may waive competition rules to get the deal through.A takeover of HBOS would end uncertainty about the health of the bank, which has seen its share price plunge in recent days amid concerns about its funding position.HBOS, which employs more than 65,000 people in the UK out of a global total of 75,000, is the biggest financial services employer in Yorkshire with more than 14,000 people in the region.The group has about 1,100 branches around the UK - including 320 in Scotland - with its three main UK bases in Halifax, Edinburgh and Bristol. About 17,000 staff are based in Scotland and more than 3,200 people are employed in the South West.Also part of the group are phone and online banking firm Intelligent Finance, investment group Clerical Medical and savings and lender Birmingham Midshires.Trade union Unite called for urgent talks with HBOS chiefs over the potential takeover.Deputy general secretary Graham Goddard said: 'We will not accept any compulsory redundancies as a result of this merger.'The country is in the grip of a credit crunch and the cost of living is spiralling. Lloyds TSB and HBOS must take a socially responsible approach to this merger and make the wellbeing of their hard-working staff a priority during these difficult times.'Unite will be meeting with the other unions at HBOS and Lloyds TSB to ensure there is a co-ordinated effort to support the staff in this time of great uncertainty.'Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.
