 Their insistence that no more government money should go towards rescuing Wall Street firms lasted four days: long enough to force Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy, send Merrill Lynch into the arms of Bank of America, and, it now appears, long enough to give Bernanke and Paulson a glimpse of what might unfold if AIG were also allowed to fail.They obviously didn't like what they saw: AIG is a $US1 trillion octopus with tentacles that reach not only into the most infected part of the markets through its credit insurance activities, but directly into the US economy itself, through AIG's more prosaic insurance activities.So AIG has joined Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Britain's Northern Rock bank, an earlier casualty, on a list of companies nationalised by their governments to avoid a panic.The Fed has driven what would normally be called a tough deal: it will advance $US85 billion to AIG over two years at usurious interest rates and get an 80 per cent shareholding in the company in return, as well as board and management control, as AIG's businesses are carved up and sold off.This capital injection is unprecedented, and it forms part of Paulson and Bernanke's Plan C (or is it D, E or F?), which prefers direct injections of cash into the markets and specific problem companies rather than rate cuts.Groups including Citigroup and UBS were expecting a half a percentage point rate cut from the Fed on Tuesday night our time. Instead, they got word that the government was back in the bail-out business at AIG - that turned the market around - and a $US50 billion ($63 billion) liquidity injection from the Fed that was part of a co-ordinated global central bank flood of money that had surpassed $US200 billion by yesterday afternoon, including a net addition of $A2.1 billion yesterday from our Reserve Bank.
