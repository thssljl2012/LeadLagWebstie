GRAND RAPIDS -- Conservative columnist George Will practically boiled out of his trademark bow tie Thursday night, lashing out at Republican presidential nominee John McCain's call for Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox's resignation.Will's keynote appearance at the downtown JW Marriott capped the first day of a West Michigan Regional Policy Conference, which organizers said was trying to avoid being ''West Michigan polite.''Will took a call from Cox shortly before taking the stage Thursday and was visibly perturbed when he hung up.''This is why some thoughtful conservatives have grave doubts about his ability to be president,'' Will said.During a speech in Iowa Thursday, McCain said Cox, a close friend of Will's, ''has betrayed the public trust'' by allowing financial markets to deteriorate.In his speech, Will said McCain worries conservatives because he is someone who ''can so polarize every argument into a kind of moral melodrama. You can't have honest difference of opinion with John McCain. This is very difficult because to disagree with he who is honor personified is inherently dishonorable.''Will also took shots at the Bush administration and its willingness to intervene to prevent the failure of mismanaged companies.''Where is the Bennigan's bailout?'' he asked the crowd of more than 500.He used the bankruptcy of the Bennigan's restaurant chain to note the ''moral hazard'' created by recent government bailouts of insurance giant AIG, mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and investment bank Bear Stearns.
