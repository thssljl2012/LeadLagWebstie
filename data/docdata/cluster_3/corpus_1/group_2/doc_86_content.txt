Fears for Britain's biggest mortgage lender deepened today as its shares plunged another 40 per cent despite the U.S. bailing out insurance giant AIG.The slide came after the Federal Reserve agreed a $85bn rescue deal with AIG overnight which initially appeared to have steadied investors' nerves.HBOS shares initially rose seven per cent with the FTSE-100 up one per cent overall but it took less than half an hour for the index to plunge back into negative territory.As it dramatically fell back more than 100 points to dip below 5,000 points for the second time in two days, the bank saw its value fall for the third consecutive day.The lender has now lost 63 per cent of its value since 'Meltdown Monday' when U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers unleashed panic by filing for bankruptcy.Fears: Shares in Halifax Bank of Scotland fell another 31 per cent today, fuelling concerns it could be the next victim of the credit crunchThe Government yesterday issued an unprecedented statement of confidence in HBOS because of the turmoil.And today, the Financial Services Authority was moved to insist once again that it was satisifed it was a well-capitalised bank.It is thought its rivals HSBC and Lloyds TSB have been lined up as potential buyers if a rescue takeover is needed.The tsunami of shock waves from the collapse of the U.S. bank Lehman Brothers continued yesterday, taking losses on the FTSE 100 to 100billion in just two days.However, in a dramatic move early today the U.S. central bank stepped in to save one of the world's biggest insurance companies from going under.Just 24 hours after US officials hinted Washington would let markets take their course and would not intervene to save threatened financial institutions, the Federal Reserve signed a 43billion rescue deal with American Insurance Group.The deal gives the Federal Reserve an 80 per cent stake in AIG, which employs 116,000 around the world, including 2,000 in the UK, and is perhaps best known in Britain as the shirt sponsor of premiership football club Manchester United.Plunge: The FTSE-100 fell below 5,000 points for the second time in three years today after an initial surge following the U.S. bailout of AIGThe move avoids a bankruptcy that could have had a more catastrophic effect on the economy than Lehman's demise.Wall Street was given another boost when Barclays agreed to buy the bankrupt U.S. investment banks New York office and two data centres in New Jersey for $1.75bn.The developments appeared to have eased the market turmoil, with Asian markets rising overnight. Japan's Nikkei index was up 1.2 per cent, with gains also seen in Taiwan, Singapore and Seoul.But initial relief at the FTSE opening up today was quickly wiped out as it plunged yet again.Yesterday, the crisis had deepened as:The FTSE 100 dropped 3.43 per cent, falling below 5,000 at one point for the first time in three years;The Bank of England pumped another 20billion of emergency funding into the market, only a day after putting in 5billion;Britain's biggest insurers admitted they have hundreds of millions of pounds of exposure to Lehman;Inflation jumped to 4.7 per cent, its highest for 16 years, amid warnings it will climb even higher;Chancellor Alistair Darling vowed to 'do everything we possibly can to maintain stability';Experts warned that plunging stock markets have added 20billion to the black hole menacing UK pension funds.HBOS - which lends one in five mortgages and has 1 in every 8 of savers' cash - was at the epicentre of the turmoil.Mr Darling and Bank of England governor Mervyn King held urgent talks about the financial health of one of the most important businesses in Britain.The regulator, the Financial Services Authority, has been put on red alert to monitor the situation and was said to be 'extremely concerned'.An FSA spokesman said: 'We can confirm that, as HBOS has already stated, it has a strong capital base and continues to fund its business satisfactorily.'Stunned: Brokers trading in London yesterday were astonished at the lossesHBOS fought desperately to calm fears as the stock market pushed its shares to their lowest in history at just 182p.For the second time in two days, it issued a statement insisting it was 'a strong bank'.But the bank's problems were compounded yesterday when the ratings agency Standard &amp;amp; Poor's offered a bleak new assessment of its health.It downgraded its credit rating and warned that the former building society was 'less well-positioned compared with major UK peers'. Nigel Greenwood, credit analyst at Standard &amp;amp; Poor's, said negative equity could become 'a material issue' for the bank.Negative equity is when the size of a borrower's mortgage is bigger than the value of the home.This is a catastrophic issue for a lender the size of HBOS at a time when its own survey figures are showing house prices falling at a record pace.Other doubts are fuelled by HBOS's dependence on the money markets to keep its business going, with only 60 per cent of its funding coming from its own depositors' money.Aghast: Traders struggle on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange yesterday as shares continued to tumble following Monday's meltdownThe collapse of Lehman has massively amplified the reluctance of financial institutions to lend to one another.Experts say the nightmare problem is that potential lenders cannot tell whether or not a would-be borrower is holding vast amounts of 'toxic' assets linked to the U.S investment bank and the sub-prime mortgage crisis which triggered the credit crunch in the first place, a year ago.Yesterday LIBOR - the rate at which banks borrow money from each other - shot to a seven-year high.This makes life even more expensive for banks like HBOS which need to borrow money to conduct their business.Worries about HBOS will unnerve its army of 15million savers who have nearly 260billion tied up in the bank.They are being urged not to worry, particularly because of the Government safety net which guarantees deposits up to 35,000 in the extreme and unlikely event of a bank hitting the rocks.The limit applies to total savings held across five firms - Halifax, Bank of Scotland, Intelligent Finance, AA Savings and Saga. Last night, the Treasury said it had been monitoring market developments 'very closely', but did not single out HBOS as a major worry.Packing up: More Lehman Brothers' workers cleared their desks at its British headquarters in London yesterday after it filed for bankruptcyIt is not the first time this year that HBOS shares have plunged.But a fall in March was triggered by malicious and false rumours about the bank.HBOS was created in September 2001 by the merger of the Halifax and the Bank of Scotland.Although HBOS was the big loser yesterday, other famous British banks also suffered.Barclays, which had been in discussions to rescue Lehman until Sunday evening, ended the trading day 2.5 percent lower at 308p, after plunging 10 per cent on Monday.The troubled buy-to-let specialist Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley lost 4.8 per cent to close at 30p.That was well below the 55p at which it recently sold fresh shares to its shareholders to raise cash.The Royal Bank of Scotland - the owner of NatWest - also saw its shares plunge another 10 per cent yesterday to reach 189.10p.Defaced: A Lehman Brothers employee writes on a portrait of the bank's chief executive Dick Fuld outside its offices in New YorkThe fall in the FTSE 100 could have been even worse but there was a late rally, fuelled by speculation that U.S. interest rates would be cut.The blue-chip index, which had been down 243 points at one point, ended the day down 178.6 points at 5,025.The hoped-for U.S. cut failed to materialise, however.The U.S. central bank the Federal Reserve, left the rate at two per cent, citing concerns about inflation.But it noted that stresses on financial markets had grown sharply and said it would take further action if needed.Until the weekend, most analysts had expected the rate to stay unchanged.But experts felt the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the financial storm that resulted had increased the chances of a cut.Crackdown on city traders exploiting market miseryThe Chancellor has given his support to a crackdown on greedy City traders by the financial regulator.There are concerns that traders are making the market crisis worse through a process known as 'short-selling', where profit is made from falling share prices.In June, the Financial Services Authority launched a review into the practice.Yesterday Alistair Darling said the FSA's review, expected later this year, has his 'full backing'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that short selling can have 'extremely damaging' consequences.Mr Darling said: 'I am extremely anxious that we avoid a situation where people can manipulate markets causing huge harm.'The regulator's review is focused on the practice of short-selling when a company is trying to raise money from its shareholders, known as a rights issue.In a rights issue the firm asks its shareholders to buy discounted shares. But the fundraising can be jeopardised by short sellers.If, for example, the shares are worth 10 and the rights issue price is 8, nobody will buy the stock if the price falls to 7. Mr Darling said the FSA had identified a problem where traders 'are engaged in speculation that can be quite harmful'.Although it is widely believed you only make money on the stock market if share prices rise, it is also possible to profit as prices fall. Typically a short-selling trader borrows shares from another investment house and sells them to a third party.If the shares are sold for 5 each and then drop to 1, the short-seller buys them back for the new price, and pockets the difference.As a result, many City traders and hedge fund managers are accused of spreading rumours to drive down prices. While short-selling is legal, the spreading of such rumours is known as 'market abuse'.Share this article:
