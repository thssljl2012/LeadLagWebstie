Marc Lawrence withdrew his money from a branch located in the bank's headquarters in Bingley town centre early this morning.Mr Lawrence, who used to work in IT for the bank before being made redundant after 30 years, said he withdrew his money amid fears for the long-term future of the company.He said: 'I am taking it out. I worked for Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley for 30 years. They were a great employer but who knows what might happen.'I worked damned hard to get the money, I just don't want to see it go down the pan.'After withdrawing his money, Mr Lawrence left the building and walked a short distance across the road to the Skipton Building Society and deposited his money there.He declined to say how much he was withdrawing, but said it was 'substantial' and more than the 35,000 limit which is safeguarded by Government guarantees.He added: 'This is a sad day for the town. I worked for them for 30 years, I am really sorry to see this, they were a great employer.'Another customer, a pensioner who declined to be named, said he was also withdrawing his money.He said: 'I am taking my money out. I have got to worry about myself. I am putting it in a bank where it is safe.'Workers remained good humoured but tight-lipped today as they arrived for work at the HQ.A steady stream of employees arrived at the West Yorkshire HQ in bright autumn sunshine, still unsure about their prospects.With the future of the bank still in the balance, no-one was prepared to comment on record.However, one worker joked 'give us a job' as he arrived this morning.Another quipped: 'I suppose I'll have to learn Spanish now' - a reference to news that the bank's savings and branch business will be bought by Spanish giant Santander.Other workers were less forthcoming and just shook their heads and quickly made their way into the entrance of the iconic concrete structure in the centre of Bingley.At one point, a company official came outside and told reporters not to transgress on to the property, saying they should contact the main press office for comment.However, one worker was prepared to speak.Remaining anonymous, he said: 'I don't know what's happening yet. Hopefully we will know a little bit more later today.'It's worrying, but what can you do?'Bingley resident Christine Harvey, 47, said news of the bank's financial problems was bad news for the town.'You have wonder which bank is next,' she said.'Every time you switch on the news or read a paper there seems to be a bank in trouble.'This is a major employer here and it will be devastating for the region if jobs were to go. These are worrying times.'More than 1,000 people work at two B&amp;amp;B sites in Bingley town centre and just outside the town in Crossflats.Local political leaders have already voiced concerns about the situation.Leader of Bradford Council Kris Hopkins said he was 'extremely concerned' that local people would suffer.He said the city had a 'significant number' of HBOS employees who had already seen several weeks of uncertainty.'We have seen two major banks which are based in the district, or are very close to it, be undermined,' he said. 'We have got to think about the local impact.'Bradford has the fourth largest metropolitan district in the country, the impact of losing two banks effectively within its borders - there is a potential for a sizeable impact on the economy.'Mr Hopkins, who is the Conservative councillor for Worth Valley, criticised the Government's handling of the recent financial crises.'They have sat back after Northern Rock folded,' he said.Tory MP Philip Davies - whose Shipley constituency in West Yorkshire includes Bingley and Crossflats - said job losses would be his major concern.'Nationalisation does not guarantee jobs being retained,' Mr Davies said.'If we are honest about it and if we are realistic about it, nationalisation is not going to be the best for jobs.'He added: 'It is very sad it has come to this. The first thing is the Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley has a fantastic heritage in the area and it is absolutely tragic to see it in the state it is in.'The MP said he would have preferred to see a Bank of England-led reconstruction package, as proposed by shadow chancellor George Osborne, but added: 'We are where we are.''My priority is to try and maintain as many local people's jobs as possible,' he said.He said he would lobby the Government to give assurances over B&amp;amp;B's employees as they had done with other troubled lenders.'The Government has moved to protect jobs in Newcastle over Northern Rock,' he said.'Not only would any job losses have a devastating effect on the families concerned, because it is such a big part of the local economy, any job losses will have a huge impact on the economy and the other factor as well is they spend an awful lot on good causes in the community.'Ann Cryer, Labour MP for Keighley, said: 'I much prefer nationalisation to instant death - which is what has happened with some of the American banks - and what do you feel if that is your constituency and hundreds of jobs are just gone in minutes?'It is just a time-keeping measure to ensure jobs. They just have to put it on hold for a bit to ensure all those jobs at Bingley.'She said she was worried that the area had been overlooked during discussions about the planned Lloyds TSB takeover of HBOS.'Everybody seems to be concerned with saving jobs in Edinburgh, but I am concerned with Halifax,' she said.Speaking outside the bank's headquarters, Robert Harrison, president of the Bingley Chamber of Trade and Commerce, said he was fearful for jobs.He said: 'I'm really saddened by the fate of Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley. I think it was a very sad occasion that such an apparently well-run organisation is brought to its knees, it seems, by no fault of their own.'Mr Harrison said the residents of Bingley owed the bank 'a great deal of gratitude' for its money and services.He added: 'I can only hope the staff involved in this find other positions in whatever organisation comes about.'Mr Harrison said he was fearful for jobs, adding: 'I feel the knock-on effects will be felt throughout the town here.' AS fears of job losses spread through the West Yorkshire town of Bingley, a Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley customer told today how he withdrew his 'substantial' life savings from the ailing bank.
