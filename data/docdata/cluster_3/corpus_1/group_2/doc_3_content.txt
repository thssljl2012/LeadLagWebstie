LLOYDS TSB is reportedly in talks to buy fellow British bank HBOS, in deep trouble on the stock market amid the crisis engulfing global financial markets, it emerged today.The BBC reported that HBOS, Britain's biggest provider of home loans, was in advanced talks for it to be bought by Lloyds TSB. The price of HBOS shares has moved wildly this week, falling by about 50 percent, but then surging on the reported takeover talks, only to ease again. The financial services regulator has said it is fundamentally sound. Spokesmen for both banks declined to comment on the speculation, but the news sent HBOS shares surging higher on markets still reeling from the bankruptcy of US investment banking giant Lehman Brothers. Heavy losses earlier on Wednesday prompted Britain's FSA financial watchdog to issue a statement saying that the group was well-funded, in an attempt to avoid a flood of savers trying to withdraw their money. Prior to the report on the BBC website, HBOS shares had nosedived 52 per cent to a low of 88 pence, as investors fretted over the state of the global banking sector despite news of a rescue for troubled US insurer AIG. However, the Lloyds TSB takeover report helped push the bank's stock back into the black, at one point rising to 220 pence.
