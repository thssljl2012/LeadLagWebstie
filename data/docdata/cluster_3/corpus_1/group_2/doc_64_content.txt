BY the time the news broke last week about the massive meltdown in the heart of New York's revered Wall Street, a major centre of the world's financial markets matrix, the Trinidad and Tobago Minister of Finance would have completed the text for her presentation today.Minister Karen Nunez-Tesheira will create a piece of history when she becomes the first woman to deliver a national budget in this country. She has been in the portfolio all of ten months, since the general election of last November 5, and all eyes will be focussed on her, from that angle alone.But that, as the events of the last week have so forcefully demonstrated, conspired to make this a veritable side-bar for today's assignment.The crash of the insurance giant AIG and the surrender of Merrill-Lynch, the formidable investment banker, have sent shock waves throughout the financial and economic foundations of the Western world. Minister Nunez-Tesheira is reported to have already telegraphed to the nation that we should not expect a voluminous presentation from her. It was meant to convey the sentiment that at least for this engagement she should not be expected to emulate her boss, the Prime Minister who had become known for delivering budget presentations well over three hours.She is expected to deliver a package well in excess of $50 billion, the biggest in the nation's history.
