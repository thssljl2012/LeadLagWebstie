It has been a bad economic week for Alex Salmond and his Nationalist government. First came the bombshell news that HBOS was to be taken over by Lloyds TSB, with all of its pessimistic implications for jobs.Today, almost right on cue, along comes more doom and gloom, ironically involving the financial institution that created so many waves in Scotland last week - Lloyds TSB.The credit crunch, according to the bank's Scottish business monitor, has Scotland firmly in its sights and could hit almost every home and business north of the Border.Up to now, the SNP administration has ridden a wave of goodwill. Now it's about to get much harder and the way the government in Edinburgh handles both the social impact of the credit crunch and the HBOS debacle will test it to the limit.Nationalists will say that they are tied by the absence of real economic levers at Holyrood and that by freezing the council tax and reducing business rates, they have attempted to mitigate the worst of the downturn.But, privately, Mr Salmond and his ministers must be ruing their insistence that Scotland was somehow better placed than the rest of the UK to ride out the storm. The Lloyds TSB report says such optimism is turning out to be so much hot political air.
