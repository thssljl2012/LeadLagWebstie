NEW YORK (AP) - An official with Barclays says the British bank has backed out of the negotiations to buy Lehman (LEE'-muhn) Brothers.The official says the troubled investment bank is attractive but doesn't meet what he describes as Barclays' stringent requirements.Earlier, Barclays appeared to be the front-runner to take over the assets of Lehman. Top government officials have been meeting with Wall Street executives again today to try to work out a sale and avoid a collapse of the bank.Barclays' decision could leave Bank of America and several private-equity firms among the narrowed group of bidders still at the table.Officials with knowledge of the talks say major banks are balking at paying to polish up Lehman's balance sheet so a suitor could buy a financially clean firm. The Fed and Treasury have said they won't use taxpayer money to rescue Lehman.
