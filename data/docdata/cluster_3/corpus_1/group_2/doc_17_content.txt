Lehman Brothers headquarters in New York City (Hiroko Masuike, )NEW YORK (AP) - The field of possible buyers for Lehman Brothers has been narrowed.An investment banking official says Bank of America and Britain's Barclays have emerged as the front runners for Lehman Brothers after a possible cash injection from its rival Wall Street banks and brokerages. But investment houses are balking at paying anything without the government putting up some money too, as it did to help JPMorgan Chase buy Bear Stearns in March.Government officials say that's not going to happen. Discussions will continue again today, though neither side seems willing to back down.Failure to get a deal could prompt skittish investors to unload shares of financial companies, which might affect stock markets world-wide tomorrow.2008 Associated Press.
