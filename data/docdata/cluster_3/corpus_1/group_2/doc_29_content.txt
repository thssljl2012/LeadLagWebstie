Troubled banking group Halifax Bank of Scotland confirmed it was in 'advanced talks' over a potential takeover by rival Lloyds TSB.Such a move would create a mortgage and savings giant with more than 330 billion of mortgages and 300 billion of deposits. It is thought the Government may waive competition rules to get the deal through.A takeover of HBOS would end uncertainty about the health of the bank, which has seen its share price plunge over the last three days amid concerns about its funding position.Lloyds TSB chairman Sir Victor Blank is reported to have discussed the proposal with Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who is wrestling with an almost unprecedented period of economic and financial market turmoil.At one point HBOS shares were down 50% - taking the stock down by more than half over the past three days. HBOS were later back into positive territory after the merger news hit the market. There were also wild swings for the wider FTSE 100 Index as investors reacted to the merger news and the US Government's 85 billion US dollar (47.2bn) bail-out of US insurance giant AIG.HBOS - which has two million smaller shareholders - is the UK's biggest mortgage lender and savings bank, boasting 258 billion of deposits. It had an estimated 20% share of the mortgage market at the end of last year and 15 million savers.Lloyds TSB, which does the bulk of its mortgage lending under its Cheltenham &amp;amp; Gloucester brand, is the UK's third biggest lender in terms of outstanding home loans. During 2007, the latest year for which figures are available, it wrote 8% of all mortgages in the UK.The bank is also the UK's third biggest savings bank, with 65 billion saved through it and Cheltenham &amp;amp; Gloucester, and the country's biggest current account provider.Lloyds TSB is reportedly willing to pay no more than 2 a share for HBOS, less than a third of the stock's value six months ago.That would be bad news for the company's two million smaller shareholders, many of whom picked up their holdings when Halifax demutualised more than a decade ago.
