HBOS chief executive Andy Hornby has defended his company's takeover by Lloyds TSB, telling staff: 'It was the right thing to do.'In an internal email he said the two institutions had been talking for some time about a deal, and claimed it would create 'a financial powerhouse'.Mr Hornby also said it could take at least three months to complete the deal - and up to three years to integrate the two institutions.His comments came in the email which sought to reassure staff over jobs.'It is of course the case that the merger will inevitably lead to some job reductions,' he said.'However, the majority of HBOS colleagues are likely to stay with the enlarged group, reflecting the sheer scale of our business.'Moreover, for most colleagues the impact of the merger is unlikely to be immediate as integration will take at least two to three years to complete.'The HBOS chief executive told his staff: 'Eric Daniels, chief executive at Lloyds TSB, and I had been talking for a while about the deal. Those talks really accelerated, however, after the momentous developments in the last few days as the world has experienced literally unprecedented turmoil in financial markets.''We agreed to be purchased by Lloyds TSB because it is the right thing to do,' he said. 'It really is as simple as that.'We had reached a point where the dramatic movements in our share price (caused by the completely unprecedented market context) were raising concerns amongst our customers. The simple truth is that I - and the rest of the HBOS board - were simply not prepared to take any risks with our great business.'Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.
