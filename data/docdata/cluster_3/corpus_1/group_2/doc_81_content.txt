More of Lehman Brothers, and more of its employees, may be able to remain in business than was the case at Bear Stearns. Barclays, the big British bank that had withdrawn from talks to buy all of Lehman over the weekend, has confirmed that it is in talks with Lehman on the possible acquisition of certain assets. If it clinches a deal, Barclays would get the good bank: the broker-dealer business, including underwriting, merger advising, and fixed income. Those businesses employ 10,000 people, most of whom could presumably keep their jobs as there is not that much of an overlap with Barclays current investment banking operations. The bad bank, the troubled real estate and investment portfolio tied to mortgages, would be liquidated by creditors, the Wall Street Journal reports. The parent holding company of Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday, giving it the ability to run the sales of its assets. The Deal.com notes: AChapter 7 filing for the whole Lehman empire would have resulted in a trustee-supervised liquidation, with little ability to maneuver for better deals. Under Chapter 11, Lehman as debtor-in-possession can supervise its own sales. Reuters reports that there is an urgency to the talks because of the belief that a deal needs to be struck quickly before clients and executives abandon the firm.
