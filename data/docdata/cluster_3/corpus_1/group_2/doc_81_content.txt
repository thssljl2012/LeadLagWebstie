The First Minister's economic advisers will meet in private next week to discuss the controversial HBOS take-over plans, despite calls for public access.Labour leader Iain Gray wrote to Alex Salmond with the request, describing the potential 12.2 billion takeover by Lloyds TSB as a matter of national interest.But the call was rejected - and it later emerged Mr Gray had named the wrong venue in his official letter, thinking it was in Dumfries instead of Dumfries House, Ayrshire.Mr Gray said: 'It is clear that questions and concerns about the Scottish economy, in general, and HBOS, in particular, must be on the agenda.'As these matters are of such national interest and public concern I have asked the First Minister to strain every sinew on behalf of the Scottish people by allowing his own Council of Economic Advisers to speak in public about how they believe Scotland's case is best advanced.'In these exceptional circumstances the Scottish people deserve to hear what the Scottish government's economic experts have to say.'Mr Gray's letter stated the meeting would be at Dumfries on Friday next week.He also called for a full transcript of proceedings to be published, rather than a summary note. The talks have been set up to help form Alex Salmond's business case for Scotland when he delivers it to Lloyds TSB.The First Minister wants to retain headquarters functions and jobs at the Bank of Scotland's traditional home on the Mound in Edinburgh.A spokesman for the First Minister said: 'It says little for Iain Gray's grasp of the issues that he thinks the Council of Economic Advisers is meeting in Dumfries.'Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.
