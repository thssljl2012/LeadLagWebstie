t 2:30 PM, the day before John McCain and President Bush are expected in New York, State Comptroller Tom Dinapoli and New York City Comptroller Bill Thompson will hold a press conference to challenge John McCain's dangerous plan to remove key protections on the health care market and discuss what it means for Americans already struggling under disastrous Bush-McCain economic policies.In spite of the unprecedented economic crisis created by Bush-McCain policies that freed banks and lenders from key safeguards meant to protect Americans, McCain wants to put Americans' health care at risk with the same approach. Just days after claiming that 'the economic fundamentals are strong,' even as Americans' savings and retirement yo-yoed with the struggling stock market, the magazine of the American Academy of Actuaries published an article by McCain claiming that 'Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.' McCain's plan for the economy and for Americans' health care means more of the same deregulation that has created today's economic crisis.Who: NYS Comptroller Tom Dinapoli NYC Comptroller Bill Thompson New Yorkers struggling to make ends meet in the Bush-McCain economyWhat:Press Conference with New York State Comptroller Tom Dinapoli and New York City Comptroller Bill Thompson to discuss McCain's plan to remove key protections on the health insurance market even after the economic crisis caused by the Bush-McCain deregulation agenda.When: Monday, September 22, 2008 2:30 PM Where: 59 Maiden Lane Plaza (In front of the Federal Reserve) To RSVP, please contact Blaine Rummel at rummelb@dnc.org.
