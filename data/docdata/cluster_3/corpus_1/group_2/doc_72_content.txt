Mr Salmond called off a planned four-day visit to the Ryder Cup golf tournament in order to press the Scottish interest in talks with Halifax Bank of Scotland and Lloyds TSB,HBOS, whose share price has plunged in recent days, said it was in 'advanced' talks on a merger that would create a 30 billion banking giant.Mr Salmond said: 'There's going to be a huge job of advocacy in the Scottish interest. I have spoken to senior officials in both banks ... and made it clear that we will be making sure these representations are made.'He also launched a scathing attack on 'spivs and speculators' whose actions had created the possibility of one of Scotland's oldest financial institutions undergoing a 'shotgun marriage'.'I am very angry that we can have a situation of a bank being forced into a merger by basically a short-selling bunch of spivs and speculators in the financial markets,' he said. 'We should not have situations where well-capitalised, properly-funded financial institutions are subject to incredible speculative attack, and that drives them into decision-making which otherwise they might not have done.'Mr Salmond said he was criticising neither HBOS nor Lloyds TSB, but the absence of safeguards to protect sound financial institutions from a 'maelstrom' of speculative pressure.He called for financial authorities to stand behind healthy institutions to protect them from such activities, and said that whatever the outcome of the merger talks, he would seek assurances on headquarters functions and decision-making staying in Scotland.HBOS, which has seen its share price plummet in recent days, was created in 2001 from the merger of the Bank of Scotland and the Halifax. The Bank of Scotland is the country's oldest bank, tracing its history to 1695 when it was founded by an act of the then Scottish Parliament.Headquartered in Edinburgh, HBOS employs around 17,000 people in Scotland while a further 7,200 are employed in Scotland by Lloyds TSB.Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.First Minister Alex Salmond has called off a visit to the United States as one of the country's big financial institutions announced it was in 'advanced' merger talks.
