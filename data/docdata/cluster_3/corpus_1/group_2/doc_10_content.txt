The Church of England has been accused by a think-tank of using short-selling tactics to maximise profit on its 5 billion investments.Ekklesia weighed into the debate on the ethics of financial investments and stock market speculation in response to comments made by senior clerics in the wake of the recent banking crisis.Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu branded the traders who cashed in on falling share prices in troubled bank HBOS as 'bank robbers' and 'asset strippers', while Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams called for fresh scrutiny and regulation of the financial world.But the religion and society think-tank Ekklesia claimed that in 2006, the Church Commissioners, which manages the Church of England's investments, set up a currency hedging programme that hedged against a fall in the value of sterling, effectively short-selling the British pound to guard against rises in other currencies.The think-tank also criticised the Church for its shareholdings in oil and mining companies.The Church Commissioners' 2007 annual report revealed that its average return over the last decade was 9.5% per year.Jonathan Bartley, co-director of Ekklesia, said: 'The archbishops should be extremely careful when attacking city 'bank robbers' for short-selling and speculation. The Church has benefited significantly from the speculation that has underpinned rising oil and commodity prices such as gold and copper.'By its own admission it has also hedged against a fall in the value of sterling, and set up a currency hedging programme in 2006, effectively short-selling sterling in the currency markets.'Mr Bartley suggested that the Church of England should invest its money in institutions such as co-operatives, friendly societies and housing associations, and to work for the good of society in return for a slightly lower profit margin.'The practice of short-selling, in which a trader or fund sells borrowed shares, gambling on a fall in price which would allow them to buy the shares back more cheaply, and so make a profit on the loss, has been widely criticised in the wake of the collapse of US bank Lehman Brothers, and the rescue of HBOS by Lloyds TSB. A temporary ban was introduced on the practice by City watchdog the Financial Services Authority last week.
