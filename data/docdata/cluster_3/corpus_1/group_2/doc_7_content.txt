A joint inquiry into the merger of Lloyds TSB and HBOS should be carried out by the Scottish Parliament and Westminster, the Scottish Liberal Democrats have said.The call came from party leader Tavish Scott as MSPs at Holyrood debated the future of the former Bank of Scotland, now HBOS.Mr Scott said he has written to John McFall, the chairman of Westminster's Treasury Select Committee and to Iain Smith, of Holyrood's Economy Committee.'I have asked them to convene a joint inquiry into the failures that have led to this crisis and the impacts that it will have on business and prosperity for companies and individuals all across Scotland,' he said.'We must learn why and we must work on the future.'Lloyds TSB agreed a 12.2 billion takeover of HBOS last week after the latter's share price plummeted.Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has earlier made a statement to Parliament, telling MSPs he would 'strain every sinew' to maximise the benefits for Scotland, but welcomed indications that the new group will retain a Scottish headquarters on Edinburgh's Mound.'More widely, we must ensure that the Scottish head office operations of the new group are as large and influential as possible,' he said.Mr Salmond described HBOS as a 'large, innovative, successful and profitable' bank which was a lynchpin of the Scottish economy.Meetings had already taken place with trade unions, and Mr Salmond said he had agreed to a request by the Scottish TUC that the National Economic Forum debate the takeover at its next meeting on October 8. But Mr Salmond came under fire from Labour leader Iain Gray over weekend claims that both Chancellor Alistair Darling and Prime Minister Gordon Brown could have done more to help HBOS.Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.
