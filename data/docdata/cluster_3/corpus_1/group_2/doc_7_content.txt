WASHINGTON -- As Wall Street convulsed Wednesday over the news of yet another government bailout for the nation's struggling financial sector, Sen. John Thune said the federal government needs to do a better job overseeing financial institutions.  'You have to strike a balance,' Thune said. 'You can't overregulate or you're not going to have a good robust market. Clearly in this case there was some greed run amok on Wall Street, a lot of bad investment decisions made and too thin of oversight and regulation and accountability.'The Federal Reserve Board announced it had agreed Tuesday evening to take over AIG, the world's largest insurance company. AIG issues insurance policies to protect investors from bond defaults. The federal government does not currently regulate the company, which was on the brink of bankruptcy.'AIG, arguably because of the tentacles that it has into so many sectors of our economy, may have been one of those cases where there was no alternative,' Thune said. 'But I'm very concerned about the trend of companies who have perhaps made bad business decisions now turning to the federal government and the taxpayer and expecting them to step in.'Thune said it's unfair to blame the Bush administration for the lack of oversight because that extends back to previous administrations. Things have changed since state legislatures and Congress began deregulating banks in the 1970s, he said.'We now exist in a worldwide market, with people having tremendous access to information,' Thune said. 'Financial transactions now are worldwide...and frankly the level of regulation, the ability to create a framework to provide oversight has not kept up with the rate and pace of change that has existed out there.'
