Lawyers voted overwhelmingly for the introduction of home reports to be delayed for at least two years.From December, all houses for sale in Scotland will have to be marketed with a home report, which includes a single survey, an energy report and a property questionnaire.But members of the Scottish Law Agents' Society (SLAS) believe it will 'destroy' the already-fragile property market.The group took its concerns to a special general meeting of the Law Society of Scotland, where it tabled a motion calling on the society to request that the Scottish Government delay the introduction of the reports for at least two years from December 1.The Law Society confirmed 2,052 solicitors voted in favour of the motion this afternoon, with only 52 voting against it - a majority in favour of 97.5%.The SLAS said a vote on such a scale was unprecedented and demonstrated the depth of feeling held by solicitors on the issue.Ken Swinton, a spokesman for SLAS and a senior lecturer in law and management at Abertay University in Dundee, said the result was 'dynamite'.'With this massive vote against home reports, lawyers have sent a firm message to the Scottish Government that they are unwelcome in the present financial environment.'Solicitors believe home reports will destroy the already-fragile Scottish property market at a time when, according to an assessment by Lloyds TSB earlier this week, the Scottish economy is 'grinding to a halt'.'Pledging to continue their fight, he added: 'There is anger that solicitors, the professionals whose job it is to advise clients with regard to the type of survey that should be instructed and accepted, have been ignored.'Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2008, All Rights Reserved.
