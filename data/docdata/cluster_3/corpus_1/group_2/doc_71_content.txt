Business leaders yesterday raised said the takeover would have 'serious implications' for customers who value HBOS's corporate banking operation.Unveiling terms of the 12 billion deal yesterday, Lloyds TSB executives would not give details of what would happen to the Bank of Scotland Corporate operation, led by the well-respected Peter Cummings.Bank of Scotland Corporate has come under fire in recent months for its increasing exposure to the housing and retail sectors and was reportedly attempting to sell its investments.But hopes that some jobs would be protected were raised when Lloyds TSB said there was an 'absolutely phenomenal' fit between Lloyds Development Capital (LDC) and the private equity business of HBOS. Lloyds TSB chief executive Eric Daniels yesterday paid tribute to the businesses skills at Bank of Scotland and said a combined private equity business would be 'maximised'.Daniels, who will be the chief executive of the proposed new banking giant, told a press conference in London: 'This is going to be a very good fit, so far from saying we're going to get rid of parts of that business, I think we are going to maximise it.'Daniels went out of his way yesterday to describe the Bank of Scotland as 'an iconic brand'. All of HBOS's business work is conducted under the Bank of Scotland brand.While LDC is close to a pure private equity business, Bank of Scotland Corporate provides integrated finance, taking long-term equity stakes in established trading businesses.Bank of Scotland Corporate has been one of the chief growth areas for the HBOS group, completing a string of deals with house building and construction companies, such as Miller Group and Tulloch, and retail ventures with Sir Tom Hunter.Lloyds TSB is a leading player in the small and medium-sized enterprise market, but its presence is much stronger in England and Wales than in Scotland. Its SME market share makes it the third largest bank behind Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays, while HBOS's share of the small business banking is in the single digits.A spokesman for Lloyds TSB Scotland said that while the bank was gaining market share in corporate banking for larger business in Scotland, its share remained in the low single digits.David Lonsdale, assistant director of CBI Scotland, said: 'Ideally, we would like to see the corporate business retained in Scotland. The substantial body of expertise built up over the years and the relationships developed with customers are very important for Scottish businesses.'LLOYDS TSB has raised hopes that at least some of HBOS's substantial business banking presence north of the Border could be retained when the takeover of the Scottish bank is completed.
