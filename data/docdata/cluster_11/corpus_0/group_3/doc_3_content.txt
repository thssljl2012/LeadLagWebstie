Twenty multinational companies are analyzed in ten major sectors; the   top ten performing companies are ranked in each category: Best EthicalQuote   Score (positive minus negative news, cumulated from 2002 to 30 September   2008), Best Ethical Progress (positive minus negative news, cumulated from 1   July to 30 September 2008) and Best Reported Performance (positive news only,   1 July to 30 September 2008).   Best EthicalQuote Score and Best EthicalQuote Progress are given by confronting   positive and negative news. Best Reported Performance is calculated by   quantifying positive news only  it shows how companies report on their   ethical performance without considering criticisms and demands. Some   companies being highly targeted by activists have a low EthicalQuote Score   while at the same time ranking high in terms of Reported Performance. We can assume that ethical demands (negative news i.e.   stakeholder issues, campaigns, expectations) stimulate ethical   offers (positive news i.e. initiatives, reporting, communication by   companies).
