April 23 2009 - PNC Financial Services Group Inc., the fifth-largest U.S. bank by deposits, rose in New York trading after posting a 38 percent jump in first-quarter profit on higher mortgage income as customers refinanced their homes. Net income climbed to $530 million, or $1.03 a share, from $384 million, or $1.09, in the same period a year earlier, the Pittsburgh-based bank said today in a statement. PNC said residential mortgage banking earned $226 million in the quarter, driven by strong loan origination and favorable income from servicing rights. Chief Executive Officer James Rohr is seeking to preserve capital and reserve against losses taken this year on the acquisition of National City Corp. as U.S. unemployment surges. The March jobless rate jumped to the highest since 1983, boosting total jobs lost since the economic slump began to about 5.1 million, according to Labor Department figures.
