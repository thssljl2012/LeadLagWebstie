Via Bloomberg.   Jefferies is out with comments this morning that the stress test may induce a conversion of preferred into common shares.  I guessed similarly in this post.  I just don't think Ken Lewis knows what he is doing.  He strikes me as manager with a surplus of imprudence.

Bank of Americas 6.204 percent preferred shares may be converted into equities worth 80 percent more than their closing price of $11.26 yesterday, Jefferies strategists led by Patrick Neal wrote in a note today. The 8.2 percent preferred could yield returns of about 59 percent if the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender decides to convert them into common stock, Jefferies estimated.             Investors have an opportunity to set up to profit from a potential common-for-preferred exchange, Jefferies analysts wrote in a report sent to clients today.             U.S. regulators may tell the 19 biggest banks today how they did on the so-called stress test meant to determine whether they have enough capital to withstand further credit losses. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said April 21 that firms needing additional capital will have a range of options for shoring up their balance sheets, including the conversion of government investments from preferred into common shares.             Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender by assets, may be forced to accept additional aid by converting between $15 billion and $20 billion of preferred shares into common stock, KBW Inc. analysts led by Frederick Cannon said yesterday. The conversion would boost the banks tangible common equity, a measure of its ability to absorb losses.
