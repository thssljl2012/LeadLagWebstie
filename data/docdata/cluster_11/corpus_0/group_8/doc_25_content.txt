The Dow rose by almost 500 points today on the strength of financial stocks.  Today's strong showing came on the heels of an unexpected rise in existing home sales and Treasury Secretary Geithner's announcement in the Wall Street Journal that the government will offer a plan to encourage private investors to help buy banks' toxic assets.  JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup all saw strong gains.
