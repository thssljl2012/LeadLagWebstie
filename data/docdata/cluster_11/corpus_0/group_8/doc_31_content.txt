In Wall Street analysis, as in the breaking-news business, there&#8217;s frequently a measure of tension between the often-warring demands of &#8221;getting it right&#8221; and &#8221;getting it fast.&#8221; Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s banking analyst Stuart Plesser got &#8216;em both this week. Plesser was the analyst who, earlier this week, said about Wells Fargo (WFC)&#8221;Based on low capital ratios and deteriorating earnings, we think it will cut its dividend in the coming months.&#8221; Bingo. Friday, Wells Fargo did just that. And did just what JPMorgan (JPM), U.S. Bancorp (USB), and PNC Financial (PNC)did in the last two weeks - and what Bank of America (BAC)and Citigroup (C)did before them: cut its dividend. After taking TARP money from the federal government. An 80%-plus haircut on the dividend seemed to be the trade-off for receiving the TARP funds, so Wells Fargo&#8217;s 85% cut - taking the payout to 5 cents a share from 34 cents - sounded about right. The bank said the move helps it gain a larger capital cushion and protect it from an adverse credit cycle. Wells Fargo&#8217;s announcement doesn&#8217;t cover Rochdale&#8217;s Dick Bove in a whole lot of glory. Bove said as recently as Thursday that Wells didn&#8217;t need to cut its dividend, though he wasn&#8217;t so much making a prediction that it wouldn&#8217;t as he was assessing that, from an operational standpoint, a dividend cut wasn&#8217;t necessary. And, he added, the market already presumed that a cut was coming. That presumption, which helped drive Wells Fargo shares down 16% Thursday in the banking sector&#8217;s latest spanking, would help explain how it is that the dividend cut isn&#8217;t being greeted as a disappointment. In fact, Wells Fargo has bounced 8% higher in Friday&#8217;s trading - something of a relief rally. Wells Fargo represented the last of the mega banks to bow to Washington pressure to cut the dividend - the argument being that it appeared unseemly to use taxpayer money to reward shareholders - so now the guessing game about whose dividend is next on the chopping block, while perhaps not over, at least moves down to the lower tranches of the banking spectrum.
