Ann Taylor Stores Corp. (NYSE:ANN) shares dropped almost 38.5% after fourth-quarter earnings announcements that the retailer's net loss grew to $375.6 million from $6.67 million in 2008 while revenue plunged 20% to $483.4 million in the quarter. The results were almost twice what Wall Street analysts had expected, according to Reuters' Shop Talk. In addition the retailer left investors hanging on a forecast for the current quarter or the fiscal 2009 outlook, citing volitile economic conditions.    Ann Taylor is among several retail chains strapped for cash and going through a restructuring. The retailer closed 117 stores last year and expects to close 163 more stores by fiscal 2010. The company started the year with 935 stores. However, it doesn't appear that the retailer will be filing for Chapter 11 any time soon, unless investors or its lenders get the best of it. Ann Taylor president and CEO Kay Krill stated:Despite the disappointing results we reported for the quarter and the year, our balance sheet and liquidity position remained strong, and we ended the year with $112 million in cash and no bank debt.  In addition, to safeguard against ongoing uncertainty in the credit market, we just drew down $125 million of our $250 million revolving credit facility, as a cushion, in the event we need incremental capital in the coming months.The revolving credit facility, which includes Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC), J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (NYSE:WFC), won't expire until 2013, so theoretically there should be enough time for the company to recover from it's losses -- assuming the economy turns around sooner rather than later. - Maria Woehr
