With the stock market deeply in the crapper, I can't help but wonder: how much lower can it go before it bounces back? Surely we're in for another 12 to 18 months of crap financial situations, but eventually things seem likely to get less bad.So the temptation to buy low is high. Legacy stocks, like GE or Bank of America, are selling for three or four bucks a share, down in Penny Stock territory. Not just that, but promising stocks for future growth are selling low too.If I was a betting man, I might take the advice of the Motley Fool and look into some cheap stocks that have potential. I'll follow these closely; curious to see if the Fools are right.
