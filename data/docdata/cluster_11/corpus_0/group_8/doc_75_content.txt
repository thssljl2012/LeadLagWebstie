Since October 3, 2008, my attempts to buy stocks near a bottom have failed miserably. My first attempt was to buy financial stocks, which have since fallen 50 to 90%, and an agricultural stock, which has fallen 10%. I have also experimented with buying calls on auto stocks and financial stocks, also without success. I've had the most success selling put contracts to open on Monsanto (MON) and Energy Conversion Devices (ENER), which earned a few hundred dollars to slightly offset the losses. In addition, I have had some success buying and selling stocks that I believe will emerge well from the recession, Monsanto, Amazon (AMZN), and Energy Conversion Device.Two weeks, I took the opportunity to sell most of my positions during the bear market rally, even if it meant taking some losses. (If I had waited until last week, I would have reduced my losses in the financial stocks by about 12%.) Last week, I sold the PNC (PNC) leap call for a small profit At this point, I only have three positions in this portfolio, Monsanto, Energy Conversion Devices, and one PNC call. If the financial stocks rally again this week, I will try to close out the remaining PNC call. I will likely hold onto Monsanto and Energy Conversion Devices for the longer term.Overall, this portfolio is down 20.9%. Financial stocks, which had losses of 52 to 84%, were the main reason for the negative returns.  In the table, the sales with gains are in blue and the sales with losses are in red.Bottom Fishing PortfolioStock or Option [purchase date]SharesPurchase PricePrice on 3/27/09Bank of America(BAC) [10/3/08]100$38.00sold on 3/20/09 @ $6.03J.P.
