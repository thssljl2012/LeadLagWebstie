I made some purchases today, including two new holdings.  I bought long dated calls on Bank of America (calls 2.8% of portfolio), and common stock in Boston Private Financial Holdings (3.1% of portfolio).  I don't know if there will be another leg down for the financials, but if so, I'll likely add to my positions at that time.  In addition, I rebuilt my call position in Nabors (calls 3.6% of portfolio).  My previous position in Nabors had been down to almost zero, as those calls are very far out-of-the-money.
