Lets take a look at the market cap of the top ten US Banks v/s State Bank of India at yesterday&#8217;s closing prices. JP Morgan Chase -$79bn Wells Fargo- $45.94bn Goldman Sachs - $39.84bn Bank of New York Mellon - $24.57bn Bank of America - $23.20bn U.S. Bancorp - $22.99bn Travelers Cos - $20.89bn Morgan Stanley - $19.29bn Metlife - $13.10bn American Express - $12.83bn If we compare the top bank in India in terms of market cap, State Bank of India (SBI) which closed at a market cap of $12.5bn, it seems like after topping Citigroup,Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and Barclays (except first, rest are not based in US) , SBI is all set to overtake Metlife and American Express this year. Isn&#8217;t it amazing that two financials having operations all over the world being overtaken by a bank with major presence in just one country. SBI is now close to Deutsche Bank. In two-three years, SBI could vault into the list of top 25 banks globally. I am not sure what is the ranking of SBI currently. If you have any idea then let me know!
