Weekafter week, we see the global economy contracting at a pace worse thanpredicted by the gloomiest analysts. We are now, it is clear, in noordinary recession but are headed for a global depression that couldlast for many years.    The Fundamental Crisis: Overaccumulation    Orthodoxeconomics has long ceased to be of any help in understanding thecrisis. Non-orthodox economics, on the other hand, providesextraordinarily powerful insights into the causes and dynamics of thecurrent crisis. From the progressive perspective, what we are seeingis the intensification of one of the central crises or "contradictions"of global capitalism: the crisis of overproduction, also known asoveraccumulation or overcapacity. This is the tendency for capitalismto build up, in the context of heightened inter-capitalist competition,tremendous productive capacity that outruns the population's capacityto consume owing to income inequalities that limit popular purchasingpower. The result is an erosion of profitability, leading to aneconomic downspin.    To understand the current collapse, wemust go back in time to the so-called Golden Age of ContemporaryCapitalism, the period from 1945 to 1975. This was a period of rapidgrowth both in the center economies and in the underdeveloped economies-- one that was partly triggered by the massive reconstruction ofEurope and East Asia after the devastation of the Second World War, andpartly by the new socioeconomic arrangements and instruments based on ahistoric class compromise between Capital and Labor that wereinstitutionalized under the new Keynesian state    But thisperiod of high growth came to an end in the mid-1970s, when the centereconomies were seized by stagflation, meaning the coexistence of lowgrowth with high inflation, which was not supposed to happen underneoclassical economics.    Stagflation, however, was but asymptom of a deeper cause: the reconstruction of Germany and Japan andthe rapid growth of industrializing economies like Brazil, Taiwan, andSouth Korea added tremendous new productive capacity and increasedglobal competition, while income inequality within countries andbetween countries limited the growth of purchasing power and demand,thus eroding profitability. This was aggravated by the massive oilprice rises of the seventies.    The most painful expressionof the crisis of overproduction was global recession of the early1980s, which was the most serious to overtake the international economysince the Great Depression, that is, before the current crisis.    Capitalismtried three escape routes from the conundrum of overproduction:neoliberal restructuring, globalization, and financialization    Escape Route   1: Neoliberal Restructuring    Neoliberalrestructuring took the form of Reaganism and Thatcherism in the Northand Structural Adjustment in the South. The aim was to invigoratecapital accumulation, and this was to be done by 1) removing stateconstraints on the growth, use, and flow of capital and wealth; and 2)redistributing income from the poor and middle classes to the rich onthe theory that the rich would then be motivated to invest and reigniteeconomic growth.    The problem with this formula was that inredistributing income to the rich, you were gutting the incomes of thepoor and middle classes, thus restricting demand, while not necessarilyinducing the rich to invest more in production. In fact, it could bemore profitable to invest in speculation.    In fact,neoliberal restructuring, which was generalized in the North and southduring the eighties and nineties, had a poor record in terms of growth:Global growth averaged 1.1 percent in the 1990s and 1.4 percent in the'80s, compared with 3.5 percent in the 1960s and 2.4 percent in the'70s, when state interventionist policies were dominant. Neoliberalrestructuring could not shake off stagnation.    Escape Route   2: Globalization    Thesecond escape route global capital took to counter stagnation was"extensive accumulation" or globalization, or the rapid integration ofsemi-capitalist, non-capitalist, or pre-capitalist areas into theglobal market economy. Rosa Luxemburg, the famous German radicaleconomist, saw this long ago in her classic "The Accumulation of Capital"  as necessary to shore up the rate of profit in the metropolitan economies.    How?By gaining access to cheap labor, by gaining new, albeit limited,markets, by gaining new sources of cheap agricultural and raw materialproducts, and by bringing into being new areas for investment ininfrastructure. Integration is accomplished via trade liberalization,removing barriers to the mobility of global capital, and abolishingbarriers to foreign investment.    China is, of course, themost prominent case of a non-capitalist area to be integrated into theglobal capitalist economy over the last 25 years.    By themiddle of the first decade of the 21st century, roughly 40-50 percentof the profits of US corporations came from their operations and salesabroad, especially in China.    The problem with this escaperoute from stagnation is that it exacerbates the problem ofoverproduction because it adds to productive capacity. A tremendousamount of manufacturing capacity has been added in China over the last25 years, and this has had a depressing effect on prices and profits.Not surprisingly, by around 1997, the profits of US corporationsstopped growing. According to one calculation, the profit rate of theFortune 500 went from 7.15 in 1960-69 to 5.30 in 1980-90 to 2.29 in1990-99 to 1.32 in 2000-2002. By the end of the 1990s, with excesscapacity in almost every industry, the gap between productive capacityand sales was the largest since the Great Depression.    Escape Route   3: Financialization    Giventhe limited gains in countering the depressive impact of overproductionvia neoliberal restructuring and globalization, the third escape route-- financialization -- became very critical for maintaining and raisingprofitability.    With investment in industry and agricultureyielding low profits owing to overcapacity, large amounts of surplusfunds have been circulating in or invested and reinvested in thefinancial sector -- that is, the financial sector is turning on itself.    Theresult is an increased bifurcation between a hyperactive financialeconomy and a stagnant real economy. As one financial executive notedin the pages of the Financial Times,"there has been an increasing disconnection between the real andfinancial economies in the last few years. The real economy has grown. . . but nothing like that of the financial economy -- until itimploded." What this observer does not tell us is that the disconnectbetween the real and the financial economy is not accidental -- thatthe financial economy exploded precisely to make up for the stagnationowing to overproduction of the real economy.    One indicatorof the super-profitability of the financial sector is that whileprofits in the US manufacturing sector came to one percent of US grossdomestic product (GDP), profits in the financial sector came to twopercent. Another is the fact that 40 percent of the total profits ofUS financial and non-financial corporations is accounted for by thefinancial sector although it is responsible for only five percent of USgross domestic product (and even that is likely to be an overestimate).    Theproblem with investing in financial sector operations is that it istantamount to squeezing value out of already created value. It maycreate profit, yes, but it does not create new value -- only industry,agricultural, trade, and services create new value. Because profit isnot based on value that is created, investment operations become veryvolatile and prices of stocks, bonds, and other forms of investment candepart very radically from their real value -- for instance, the stockof Internet startups may keep rising to heights unknown, driven mainlyby upwardly spiraling financial valuations.    Profits thendepend on taking advantage of upward price departures from the value ofcommodities, then selling before reality enforces a "correction," thatis a crash back to real values. The radical rise of prices of an assetfar beyond real values is what is called the formation of a bubble.    Profitabilitybeing dependent on speculative coups, it is not surprising that thefinance sector lurches from one bubble to another, or from onespeculative mania to another. Because it is driven by speculativemania, finance-driven capitalism has experienced about 100 financialcrises since capital markets were deregulated and liberalized in the1980s, the most serious before the current crisis being the AsianFinancial Crisis of 1997.    Dynamics of the Subprime Implosion    Thecurrent Wall Street collapse has its roots in the Technology Bubble ofthe late 1990s, when the price of the stocks of Internet startupsskyrocketed, then collapsed, resulting in the loss of $7 trillion worthof assets and the recession of 2001-2002.    The loose moneypolicies of the Fed under Alan Greenspan had encouraged the TechnologyBubble, and when it collapsed into a recession, Greenspan, trying tocounter a long recession, cut the prime rate to a 45-year low of 1.0percent in June 2003 and kept it there for over a year. This had theeffect of encouraging another bubble -- the real estate bubble.    Asearly as 2002, progressive economists were warning about the realestate bubble. However, as late as 2005, then Council of EconomicAdvisers Chairman and now Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernankeattributed the rise in US housing prices to "strong economicfundamentals" instead of speculative activity. Is it any wonder thathe was caught completely off guard when the Subprime Crisis broke inthe sum...
