 For the first time in 12 years, the Dow Jones Industrial average opened below 7,000 this morning.  The drop came on the heels of news that the government will invest another $30 billion in AIG after the insurance giant posted the largest quarterly losses in the company's history. The Dow fell 93 points (1.3%) to 6,969 24 minutes into trading.  The Dow has not been down to that level since 1997.  The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index also fell, dropping 1.4% (10 points).  Nasdaq fell 7 points, or .5%. SHares of AIG, on the otherhand, were up in early trading.  Shares were up 7 cents (17%) to 49 cents.  However, shares are still off 99% for the year. Monday morning AIG announced that it lost $67.1 billion during the fourth quarter, and would thus access $30 billion in taxpayer dollars as a part of the restructuring of its federal bailout package.  This marks the fourth time that the government has had to step in to help the company since September 2008. Markets around the globe were also down. Japan's Nikkei closed down 288 points (4%), at 7,280.15. London's FTSE dropped more than 138 points (3.6%) to 3,691.55 on news of plummeting profits at HBSC, the largest bank in the UK.
