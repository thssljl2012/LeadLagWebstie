 A four-point rally is nonetheless still a rally, and the Standard &#038; Poor&#8217;s 500-stock index even managed to eke out a 0.2% gain. So that qualifies as the first two-day advance since the beginning of February, and while the move is hardly convincing of anything, the market did not fall, and key sectors ended higher, including banks, brokerages, retailers and industrial stocks. Investors continued to move money back into financial shares, but let&#8217;s not get all jumpy here &#8212; Citigroup is still worth almost nothing, and Bank of America isn&#8217;t traded at $5 a share just yet either. A few other positive signs for the worried include volume figures &#8212; healthy volume of 1.75 billion on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 1.05 billion in advancing volume, and advancers outpacing decliners on both the Big Board and the Nasdaq Stock Market. The day&#8217;s gyrations still suggest that investors are more likely to trade this market than invest in it, but traders took the action as a positive nonetheless. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a tremendous amount of pessimism,&#8221; says Todd Clark, director of trading at Nollenberger Capital Markets. &#8220;The retailers and financials are certainly acting much better.&#8221;   The dollar&#8217;s recent pullback against other currencies may represent only a temporary respite from its broader trend, and once again, that may depend on the activity of the stock market. The dollar has been gaining against most major currencies, but lately its strength against the yen has been arrested. It dropped to 97.15 Wednesday, after a strong run that took the currency from 88.70 on January 22 to 99.06 on March 4. &#8220;It is possible that as equities bottom out a bit here and more of an appetite for risk comes on, according to the correlations we&#8217;ve seen, it would favor more dollar weakness,&#8221; says Sacha Tihanyi, currency strategist at Scotia Capital. Still, he makes a distinction between buying in the dollar and in the Japanese currency, noting that those flocking to dollars are still doing so out of comfort with safer U.S. assets (like it or not, U.S. assets are still considered the &#8217;safe&#8217; ones), while movements in the yen tend to suggest repatriation of funds or unwinding of positions, where investors borrowed in the low-yielding currency to buy elsewhere. A few more days of strength in the stock market would favor the yen against the dollar, but the reality of the weakness in the Japanese economy will eventually come into conflict with that strength. However, analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman point out that Japan&#8217;s currency does not &#8220;consistently respond to Japanese economic data&#8221; as one might anticipate. Japan will release its final estimate of fourth-quarter GDP overnight, expected to be revised down from the 12.7% contraction (good lord).   If Jamie Dimon says it, should people listen? The CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase &#038; Co. had some wide-ranging thoughts about the state of the banks, regulation and the economy in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and in later interviews, managing to note that his company, like Citigroup Inc., has been profitable through the first two months of the quarter. Within that, he also threw out a few eye-raising assertions mixed in with what qualifies as tough words to colleagues in his profession. (This is typical for Mr. Dimon, who in July intoned darkly about the &#8220;very serious issues&#8221; the banking industry had to face, while at the same time focusing on those spreading rumors about banks going under, rather than banks actually going under.)  Wednesday, Mr. Dimon said that &#8220;just because regulators let you do something does not mean you should have done it,&#8221; which is cold comfort to the now-axed employees of all of those bankers that went ahead and did what they wanted, much less taxpayers, shouldering the burden for bad bets that had to be bailed out by the government. He also said that &#8220;good regulation could have helped us avoid a lot of problems.&#8221; Yes, good regulation &#8212; such as, say, the Glass-Steagall Act and a few other things that were repealed because they were supposedly out-of-date. Of course, he&#8217;s still against mark-to-market accounting, which he says was applied to a &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; level. But that&#8217;s an indictment more of the banking institutions than the regulators, as the rule in question, FAS 157, allows for leeway when the market prices observed are considered to be out of whack. (Besides, as consumers transition to a much-reduced debt level and real estate values fall, this still sounds like sour grapes for lost money.) But even at this point, with major market averages down more than 50% and Wall Street bankers about as loved as the guy in charge of shooting stray dogs, he still managed to throw out this bit of self-pity: &#8220;When I hear the constant vilification of corporate America, I personally don&#8217;t understand it.&#8221; Maybe you could try, Mr. Dimon.  News that the Securities and Exchange Commission nabbed the organizers of two separate Ponzi schemes would, in another time, be hailed as solid work by a much-maligned regulatory agency. After all, the SEC charged two California residents with allegedly running such a scheme that raised more than $40 million, and caught a Virginia resident earlier in the day for obtaining more than $11 million fraudulently. Bravo, fellows. Of course, the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme that netted $50 billion (currently residing in another dimension) was missed, and Allen Stanford continues to thumb his nose at everyone after his scheme was exposed. Maybe by now there&#8217;s some sort of strange trigger that sets off all of the other Ponzi schemes when one is finally given up, like a network of sorts. In one of the schemes, the perpetrator allegedly fabricated screen shots of account statements. But the news prompts two questions: for one, where was all of this aggressive sleuthing a few months ago? And second, to those operating the schemes &#8212; after Mr. Madoff was caught, what were you still doing in the country?
