About a year ago I wrote a long post on community banks in Pennsylvania for Community Bank Week.  In November I updated that post with a list of community banks (from the membership list of the in Pennsylvania Association of Community Bankers) in Bucks, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties that are traded on a stock exchange and included in The Motley Fool website.  Seven banks fit that criteria.  The November post listed those banks, their ticker, price that day and the 52 week high and low.  I have rechecked those stocks and provide the same information, updated as of Friday, March 6th.  Ive also noted whether the stock was trading higher or lower than the S&amp;P 500.  Abington Bank ABBC $6.39 / $6.31  $12.40, higher (Nov 08  $10.35 / $8.44  $12.40)Harleysville National Bank &amp; Trust Co. HNBC  $4.45 / $5.07  $20.60, lower (Nov. 08 -- $14.18 / $10.24 - $20.60)Bryn Mawr Trust Co BMTC $14.50 / $13.33  $28.21, higher (Nov. 08 -- $19.01 / $16.13 - $28.21) Alliance Bank ALLB $7.50 / $6.53  $9.75, higher (Nov. 08 -- $8.01 / $6.53 - $9.75)Beneficial Savings Bank BNCL $8.54 / $8.43 - $14.64, higher (Nov. 08 -- $11.85 / $8.73 - $14.64)Prudential Savings Bank PBIP $10.13 / $7.50 - $12.74, higher (Nov. 08 -- $10.00, $8.32 - $13.00)Republic First Bank FRBK $4.69 / $4.02 - $10.73, higher (Nov. 08 -- $9.00 / $4.20 - $10.73)Three of the banks were trading at or near their 52 week low.  However only one was doing worse than the S&amp;P 500.  I checked Mellon, Wells Fargo, Bank of America,  US Bancorp, Citizens Republic Bancorp, First United Corp; all were trading below the S&amp;P 500. JP Morgan Chase was right at the S&amp;P.  Those are the national banks that came to mind  you should check others to be thorough.  Looks to me like community banks are doing better than the big guys.  [Full Disclosure: My household owns a small amount of stock in one of these banks, which is one reason why I'm interested in the topic.]
