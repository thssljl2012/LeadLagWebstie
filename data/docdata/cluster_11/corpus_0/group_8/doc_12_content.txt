It seems that bond ratings agencies still have some merit, or at least investors still read what they write about. Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s has lowered and reaffirmed some ratings for Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC).  S&amp;P cut the long-term counterparty credit rating of the bank to &#8220;A&#8221; from A+&#8221;" and affirmed its &#8220;A-1&#8243; short-term ratings. Other changes are as follows:  lowered its ratings on B of A&#8217;s bank subsidiaries to &#8220;A+/A-1&#8243; from &#8220;AA-/A-1+&#8221; lowered lowered B of A&#8217;s hybrid rating to &#8220;BB-&#8221; from &#8220;BBB&#8221; lowered the hybrid ratings on the bank subsidiaries to &#8220;BB&#8221; from &#8220;BBB+&#8221;  S&amp;P has affirmed its &#8216;AAA&#8217; rating on the FDIC-guaranteed debt of BofA and its subsidiaries. As far as the outlook, S&amp;P has said that the outlook of B of A and its bank subsidiaries remains negative. As part of the note, S&amp;P said, &#8220;B of A&#8217;s creditworthiness has deteriorated given its exposure to consumer credit and more generally to various asset types that have approached&#8211;and, in certain instances, exceeded&#8211;the stress tests we used as a basis for our Dec. 19, 2008, sector review of large complex banks and brokers&#8230;. Our ratings on BofA consider a material weakening in the operating environment leading to declines in earnings. Further write-downs associated with the Countrywide and Merrill Lynch acquisitions are also a possibility.&#8221; S&amp;P also now expects less than the original target of a 50% to 75% of normal earnings run rates. The S&amp;P note also sees substantial downside to its own expectations for earnings. Interestingly enough, B of A stock is still up about 1% at $3.67 today. JON C.
