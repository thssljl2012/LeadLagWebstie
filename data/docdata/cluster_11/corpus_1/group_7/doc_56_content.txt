Stocks slumped in trading Wednesday in the wake of President Obamas attempt to quell market fears in an address to Congress and with banks bracing for a so-called stress test from the U.S. Treasury Department.  The Dow dropped to 7,227.16, down 123.78 points, or 1.68 percent, by noon. Nasdaq was at 1,415.38, down 26.45 points, or 1.83 percent.  In a televised address Tuesday evening, Obama vowed to lead the nation out of the ongoing economic crisis, but a new batch of housing and layoff statistics released Wednesday combined with persistent market jitters to drag down the major indexes.  Shares of financial services firms and manufacturers led the decline, and that was playing out in Greater Baltimore with modest stock drops seen at a host of banks across the region:   Legg Mason (NYSE: LM) stock was trading down almost 6 percent to $13.43.
