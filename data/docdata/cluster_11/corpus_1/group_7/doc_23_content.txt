[BRIEFING.COM] After stabilizing in the wake of a Tuesday's steep sell off without further deterioration Wednesday, short-sellers were compelled to cover their bets against further declines. That helped push the major indices to early gains this session. Those gains have since been reversed as another day of uninspiring headlines has failed to improve overall sentiment and attract buyers from the sidelines.   Stocks traded more than 1% higher in the first few minutes of trading. Gains were broad-based as nine of the 10 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 traded with gains.   Technology (-2.4%) was the only sector to trade with a loss, and remains the session's worst performing sector. Tech's weakness has followed an in-line earnings announcement and mixed forecast from Hewlett-Packard (HPQ 31.55, -2.53), which has weighed on the Nasdaq.   In other corporate news, CVS Caremark (CVS 28.60, +1.61), Newmont Mining (NEM 41.82, -0.94), Noble Energy (NBL 50.17, +1.53), and Sprint Nextel (S 3.46, +0.75) all announced better-than-expected quarterly earnings. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola (KO 43.44, +0.76) increased its quarterly dividend, winning it favor among investors.   In economic data, initial jobless claims were unchanged week-over-week at 627,000. That's more than economists expected. That keeps the four-week moving average above 600,000.   Meanwhile, continuing jobless claims now stand at a record high of 4.99 million. The consensus forecast for continuing claims was pegged at 4.81 million.   The Producer Price Index and core PPI, closely watched inflationary measures, increased more than expected. The PPI was up 0.8% in January, rising for the first time since August. Core PPI increased 0.4% after increasing 0.2% the month before. The January index of leading economic indicators increased 0.4%, topping the 0.1% increase that was widely expected.   Despite the appearance of strength in the early going, stocks have fallen under pressure. The renewed selling effort has been focused on the financial sector, which was up as much as 2.4%, but is now down 2.0%. Financials had been down as much as 3.7% amid ongoing weakness in Dow components Bank of America (BAC 4.10, -0.47) and Citigroup (C 2.60, -0.31).   The weakness in BAC and C helped drag the Dow below its November closing low of 7,552. However, the S&amp;P 500 is still holding above its November closing low of 752. Still, traders consider 800 to be a key level to watch in the S&amp;P 500. A break above 800 could prompt short-covering, while a test and failure to break above 800 suggests further range-bound trading, or even fresh weakness.
