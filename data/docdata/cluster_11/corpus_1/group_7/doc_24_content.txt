MILWAUKEE - Shares of Smithfield Foods Inc. fell on Tuesday along with the broader market, after the nation's largest pork producer said it would restructure its pork business by shuttering six factories and cutting 1,800 jobs.  The Smithfield, Va.-based company's shares shed 60 cents, or 6.3 percent, to $8.97 in morning trading.  Before the market opened, the company said it plans to combine seven of its independent operating companies into three main units and focus more on its high-margin packaged meat business.  Smithfield estimates it will save about $55 million in fiscal 2010 and $125 million by the following year, after expenses due to the cuts.  Deutsche Bank-North America analyst Christina McGlone said there should be cost savings from streamlining office and corporate functions, closing plants and using existing ones more efficiently. The company will combine jobs, such as taking the international sales forces from its various units into one, she wrote.'Execution of the major overhaul is key,' she wrote to clients.  Smithfield's announcement comes as the industry is recovering from volatile energy and commodity costs that reached record highs over the summer. An oversupply of meat on the market has been keeping prices down, while tight credit markets have hurt the potential for exports, a key market for meat producers. Further, a drop in restaurant spending by consumers has lowered demand.  In midmorning trading, the Dow was down 3.2 percent, to 7,599.20, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite index were each off by over 3.5 percent, as investors mulled whether the government can quickly jump-start the foundering economy.
