The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed nearly 300 points, or 3.8 percent, to close around 7552, within one point of its November closing low. (The intraday low from that November rout is about 100 points lower.)  The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq lost more than 4 percent.  This comes after last week's 5.3-percent drop in the Dow as few details on the execution of the stimulus plan and worries about the potential for wiping out bank stocks weighed on the market. Financials were the week's worst performer, down 10 percent, while health care was the best, down just 2.4 percent.  'Today feels like another shot to the gut,' Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller &amp; Washington, wrote in a guest blog post. But here's the news flash: 'It's too late to panic,' Farr wrote, suggesting it's time to buy.  'Play defense, but PLAY!' Farr wrote.  The latest sign of the deepening recession came from the New York Federal Reserve, which reported its Empire State manufacturing index fell to a record minus-34.65 from minus-22.2 in January. Economists had expected a much milder decline of minus-24. New orders fell to an all-time low.  This report from the New York Fed, along with a reading from the Philadelphia Fed later this week, is closely watched as a precursor to the national reading from the Institute for Supply Management, due out in two weeks.  Worries about more bank nationalizations also weighed on investors returning from the three-day weekend after markets were closed for Presidents' Day Monday.

This came amid a fresh wave of bank worries overseas after a report yesterday from Moody's indicated there could be more downgrades of European banks due to their exposure to Eastern European companies and governments and deteriorating economic conditions there. In the UK, Lloyds shares fell for the third straight session as investors worried that the bank will be nationalized.  General Motors  loading...    [GM Loading...

Stocks in Europe and Asia fell again, following a G7 weekend meeting accomplished little but the ousting of Japan's finance minister amid accusations he was drunk at a press conference and international criticism of the US stimulus plan.
