BOGOTA -(Dow Jones)- Cali-based food company Colombina plans to sell 150 billion Colombian pesos (($60 million) in bonds, Duff &amp; Phelps told the securities regulator, Monday.  Colombina will use the proceeds to substitute short-term debt for longer debt, Duff &amp; Phelps said in a report.  Colombina will sell bonds tied to inflation-index, the country's benchmark rate DTF and fixed rate bonds but it didn't say when it will sell the bonds.  The investment bank unit of Citibank (C) will handle the sale.  Colombina sold COP744 billion worth of food products in the first nine months of last year. The company produces candy, chocolates, cookies, ice cream and preserved food products.
