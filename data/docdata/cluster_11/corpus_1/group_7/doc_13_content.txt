For rattled investors, there may be no better salve than the word of a trusted sage.  Enter billionaire investor Warren Buffett, aka the Oracle of Omaha.  Buffett is expected to provide some guidance next week when he discloses Berkshire Hathaway's equity holdings as of last month, and he may dole out even more candid insight in his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders.  Even in ordinary times, investors will eat up anything that gives them an idea of how Buffett is thinking. That's only magnified now, given the volatility that has spooked many investors right out of the market.  Buffett's investing prowess has shown no signs of subsiding though. Only yesterday, he made news by infusing $150 million into New Jersey-based Sealed Air, and last week he agreed to invest $2.6 billion in the tottering Swiss Reinsurance Company, one of the world's largest reinsurance businesses.  According to staffers at tickerspy.com, if Buffett's upcoming disclosure reveals that he still finds stocks worthy of buying on the open market, it could prove to be powerful enough to release the bull -- at least, for a short spell -- on Wall Street. The reverberations could give the whole market a bounce.  While Buffett is likely to hold onto his long-standing positions in Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble, it's less clear what his moves will be when it comes to Wells Fargo and Bank of America, Buffett's large-stake holdings in the troubled financial industry.
