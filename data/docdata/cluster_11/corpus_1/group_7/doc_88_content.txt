Stocks return to losing ways, though losses were minor compared with recent sessions. The Dow (^DJI) closed the session with a loss of 80.05 points, or 1.09 percent, to a level of 7,270.89. The S&amp;P 500 (^SPX) fell 8.24 points, or 1.07 percent, finishing the session at 764.90. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) gave up 16.40 points, or 1.14 percent, to 1,425.43. Volume remained heavy on the session with 1.80 billion shares traded on the NYSE and 2.40 billion shares exchanging hands on the Naz. Market breadth was negative by an 11-to-18 and 8-to-19 margin on the Big Board and Naz respectively.   The bulls looked like they would be able to win the battle for the second straight session Wednesday, but comments by President Obama late in the session pushed stocks lower. Fed Chairman Bernanke continued his semiannual testimony on Capitol Hill today, once again reiterating that nationalization of banks is not the goal or the plan. However, Mr. Obama later stated that stricter oversight of financial institutions is necessary. The fact is that Wall Street doesn't like government intervention, but due to recent events, this is likely to occur nonetheless. Financial shares did rally late in the session, but the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) ultimately ended the day with a minor loss of 0.62 percent.  In related news, Merrill Lynch posted a loss of $15.84 billion in the fourth quarter, which happened to be $500 million more than Bank of America (BAC) had expected. Nonetheless, BAC shares rallied on the session on the view that nationalization is not likely. BAC shares gained 9.09 percent to close at $5.16. Bank of America and JPMorgan (JPM), which gained 3.38 percent, were the 2nd and 3rd strongest gainers on the Dow.  The top performing Dow stock Wednesday was General Motors (GM) with the automaker up 14.86 percent to $2.55. This is the second consecutive session of gains for GM following comments from a U.S. senator that the Obama administration's task force was not trying to force automakers into bankruptcy.  In economic news, existing home sales unexpectedly fell by 5.3 percent to a level of 4.49 million annualized units. Expectations were for a mild rise to 4.80 million from the 4.74 million rate seen in December. Supply of existing homes worsened as well to 9.6 months from 9.4 months. The median price of an existing home fell 3.1 percent to $170,300, which is a 14.8 percent decline year on year. On Thursday, data on new home sales will garner attention as will durable goods orders and weekly jobless claims.  Jody OsborneSenior Writer &amp; Options Strategist ~ Your Options Education Site
