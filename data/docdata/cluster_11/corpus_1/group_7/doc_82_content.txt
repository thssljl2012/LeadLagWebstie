Retail sales unexpectedly rose 1% in January. Wall Street thought the Commerce Department would report a drop of 0.8% percent after a 2.7% plunge in December. Meanwhile, the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell less than expected to 623,000. Analysts were expecting claims to fall to 610,000 from the previous week's 631,000.   Investors are preferring to focus on the likelihood of success of the $789bn compromise stimulus plan, which could be put to a vote in both the House and Senate on Friday after a deal was struck yesterday. Most pundits remain sceptical that the deal will be the "silver bullet" that puts paid to the economy's problems. Banks feature prominently among the laggards, with Bank of America, American Express, Citigroup and JP Morgan all sharply lower.   Fizzy drink maker Coca-Cola bucks the trend with better than expected fourth quarter figures. Net income eased to $995m from $1.21bn in the fourth quarter of 2007. Earnings per share fell to $0.43 from $0.52, but rose to $0.64 when exceptional charges were excluded; analysts had been expecting earnings per share of $0.61 excluding exceptionals.   Health insurer Aetna was looking sickly, however, after announcing a 57% slide in fourth quarter profits, after the company took a $198m hit to profits relating to restructuring charges.   Hotel chain Marriott International was another disappointing with fourth quarter results.   Oil stocks were friendless as the price of crude oil futures fell to around the $35 a barrel level.
