The broader financial sector, represented by the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF:XLF Last: Delayed quote data Analyst   Create alert Insider   Discuss Financials   , , ) , which tracks the financial stocks in the S&amp;P 500, fell 6% Analysts at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods said Thursday that by their estimate, 11 of the nation's biggest banks face the need to sell up to $116 billion of new common stock to meet capital requirements under a U.S. plan to stress test the industry. And, Goldman Sachs, in it own research report late Wednesday said that the planned government intervention is better for lenders than for borrowers. Goldman also said it expects bank losses to continue, and that in their estimate the sector has recorded only half the losses it must take. 'We forecast $2.1 trillion of losses from U.S. credit this cycle, or a roughly 9% cumulative loss rate,' Goldman said. 'About $1.1 trillion of losses have been announced to date, or about half of our total estimate, with about 80% of these losses showing up at US institutions and the remainder showing up primarily in Europe,' Goldman concluded.

Part of that plan called for the private sector to partner with the government to buy up troubled assets from the banks. Gasparino reported that Goldman and other attendees at the meeting are concerned with the lack of detail about the plan, and they are said to believe that more details and faster action are called for. 'Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., Bain Capital LLC, Perry Capital, Putnam Investments, and Citadel Investment Group LLC were all reported to be at the meeting.
