Foreign and local analysts yesterday differed on the stability of the naira, which traded at around 117 to the United States dollar before November 26.   Yesterday, banks sold the U.S. currency to clients at 148.80 naira to a dollar   While foreign analysts at banks including Citigroup Inc., Renaissance Capital and Standard Bank Group Ltd., say the naira may slump further, local analysts strongly disagree.   An Economist at Citigroup in London, David Cowan, according to Bloomberg news, said the naira might weaken to about 173 per dollar by year-end as lower oil prices limit dollar earnings and drive up demand for foreign exchange.   This, he said, might not be unconnected with Nigeria's middle class of about 20 million people that has an estimated demand for foreign exchange of "between $20 billion and $100 billion" for the rest of 2009. "The Central Bank would need reserves in the order of $100 billion, or more, to act as appropriate insurance against this local demand for foreign currency," Cowan wrote in a report this month. "For many Nigerians, the naira is not really seen as a reliable long-term store of wealth and, until this view changes, the Central Bank will have to hold reserves over and above what would be considered normal if it wishes to sustain confidence in the currency." The foreign-exchange rules are "not a positive" and the "outlook for the exchange rate is uncertain," Bank of America Corp. analyst John Storey also wrote in a research note on Monday.   But the Managing Director, Financial Derivatives Company Limited, Mr. Bismarck Rewane, and his counterpart at Economic Associates, Ayo Teriba, expressed optimism about the stability of the naira.   Rewane expressed confidence that the naira will remain stable as long as the price of oil does not drop drastically.   According to him, the current disquiet in Nigeria's foreign exchange market over the new trading rules would soon fizzle away. "But I must confess to you that this is a very critical moment for Nigeria and all hands must be on deck," he said. Teriba was also bullish about the naira, which, he noted, had been weak for about two quarters.   He was also very optimistic that the naira will strengthen by the second quarter of this year - as oil recovers in the international market.   Teriba however, said the naira might weaken if the price of oil continues to fall at the international market.   Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, has also assured stakeholders that Nigeria would stabilise the naira without depleting its foreign reserves, which currently stands at about over $50 billion.   Soludo, who gave this assurance in an interview with Bloomberg Television in London, Monday, said the CBN has a "flexible" exchange-rate policy.   He said currency-trading restrictions imposed last week are "temporary," designed to prevent the CBN from running down international reserves as Russia has done to support the ruble. "The reforms we decided to make on the exchange market are designed to avoid the Russian experience, where they wanted to defend a particular exchange rate, we wanted to ensure the naira was relatively stable within a reasonable band," Soludo further said.
