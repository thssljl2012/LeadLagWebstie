The new Treasury secretary may be unveiling a financial rescue plan on Tuesday, but its the Oppenheimer analyst whos got the street cred. If Whitney says that Geithners approach wont work, expect investors to listen.  And why not? Whitneys been right the whole time. Shes a huge bear on the financials, and recent statements shes made only emphasize that. She told Bloomberg TV just last week, Investors should not even consider owning banks at this point on an equity basis. So if traders take Bank of America  loading...    [BAC Loading...

()  ] up after Geithners announcement, Whitneys response will most likely bring them right back down.  And thats just what Cramers predicting for tomorrow. Geithner will get an hour or two grace period, and all the while Whitney will be telling her Oppenheimer clients to sell, sell, sell. Then shell go on air and pick apart the Treasury secretarys plan. The only banks left standing after that, Cramer said, would be Morgan Stanley  loading...    [MS Loading...   ()  ] and Goldman Sachs  loading...    [GS Loading...
