 When the U.S. Treasury Department put the bank-rescue plan on hold for a day, it effectively did the same for the stock market and U.S. stock indexes finished very near the flat line Monday. Some of the stocks like Coca-Cola that rallied Friday was down a little Monday, while economically sensitive stocks that missed out on Friday's bounce, such as General Electric, were higher. GE rose 1.54, or 14%, to 12.64, the biggest gainer on the Dow Jones Industrials Average. The conglomerate stands to gain from a bank rescue plan because of its GE Capital unit's exposure to lending markets. It may also benefit from investment in heavy construction projects stemming from the economic-stimulus package. Lastly, more than 100 million GE shares are out on loan, borrowed by bears on the stock who are sometimes forced into the market to buy stocks and cover their bet. 'I think it's just an overdue...short covering bounce,' said Lorenzo Di Mattia, manager of hedge fund Sibilla Global Fund. Credit Suisse said GE's recent statement that it will keep its dividend payment under review was a tacit retreat from a long-term commitment to the dividend. Many financial stocks bounced ahead of a multi-faceted bank salvage plan expected from Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Tuesday. Bank of America rose 76 cents, or 12%, to 6.89. Overall, the Dow fell 9.72 points, or 0.12%, to 8270.87, giving back a modicum of its 3.5% gain from last week. The DJIA was hurt by a 2.8% drop for Coca-Cola to 42.31 as investors grew wary ahead of Coke's Thursday earnings report. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index tacked on 1.29, or 0.15%, to 869.89. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.15 of a point, or 0.01%, to 1591.56. 'There has literally been a leak a day about what the (Treasury) plan will look like for about a month, and each day's new plan has looked totally different than the one from the day before,' wrote Stephen Stanley of Royal Bank of Scotland. 'The fact that the plans keep morphing tells us that the guys in charge don't have any easy answers.' -Contact: 201-938-5400
