One consolation for stock investors: There were only four trading days last week. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell every day last week, ending Friday just 18 points from an 11-year closing low. The Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, careened through its current bear market low set in November and ended at its lowest close since October 2002. 'Investors are quite simply running out of short-term confidence with equities - especially among the banks - and as they batten down the hatches we're seeing these big technical levels being tested,' said Matt Buckland, a dealer at CMC Markets.  Talk of nationalization of Citigroup and Bank of America raised fears the government would take control and wipe out shareholders in the process. 'The values of the companies seem so ridiculously depressed because no one believes in their values, and no one believes in their values because they think the government is going to take them over,' said Ken Crawford, senior portfolio manager at Argent Capital Management.  Citigroup, long considered one of the nation's bellwether companies and a member of the Dow Jones, ended the week at $1.95 a share, the lowest point since 1991. And General Electric, arguably the most iconic U.S. company and another Dow component, opens for trading Monday with its shares at $9.38, a 14-year low. Five of the 30 companies in the Dow index are selling for under $10 a share.  The Dow closed Friday at 7,365.67 points, a loss of 6.2 percent for the week. The Nasdaq composite index finished at 1,441.23, down 6.1 percent. The S&amp;P 500 index ended the week at 770.05, a drop of 6.9 percent.  7,846  DOW  7,259  1,491  NASDAQ  1,416  819 S&amp;  754  Numbers are week's intraday highs and lows
