Bernstein research said that while parts of GE could be overstating the value of some of its assets, he didn't see a need for immediate action. 'We think such write-downs, if needed, would be spread over several years, which will lessen the need for equity raises, but will hurt long-term earnings,' the firm wrote. Shares of GE, a Dow component, rose 4.8 percent to $6.98.
