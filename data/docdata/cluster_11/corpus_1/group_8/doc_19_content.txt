The Fed's 'baseline scenario' for 2009 unemployment is 8.4%. Unemployment under the Fed's 'adverse scenario' is seen at 8.9% for 2009.  Since we are already at 8.1% unemployment and losing 600K jobs per month, the Fed's 'adverse scenario' of 8.9% unemployment is looking pollyannish and the 'baseline scenario' of 8.4% is looking ridiculous.  Banks that will be run through the stress-test include: Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE: WFC), Citigroup, Inc. (NYSE: C) and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM), among others.
