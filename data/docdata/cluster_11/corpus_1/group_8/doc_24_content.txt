(FinancialWire) (By Genevieve Hawkins) -- Economic concerns may have swamped bargain hunters last week, but a considerable rally could be baked into the cake if the Dow starts playing around with numbers in the 6000s. Last week Obama's budget plan and the government's deal to take a 36% stake in Citibank compounded dour economic data, leaving the major indexes crashing through their November lows. Continuous government intervention has been counterproductive to the stock market as of late, so perhaps Germany's rejection of a new bailout plan overseas will spark a needed rally. For the week, investors will be bracing for news about the unemployment rate and for readings from the Fed's Beige book of economic indicators. Clearly the markets are faring poorly with the economy stuck in a negative feedback loop, but many stocks are now reaching value levels. With the S&amp;P and the Dow both recording over 11% losses in February, a rebound should statistically be building momentum. That's provided the bottom doesn't truly fall out during the current crisis.
