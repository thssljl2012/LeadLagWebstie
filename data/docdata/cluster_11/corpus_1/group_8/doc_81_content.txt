Stocks break out in big way with the major market indices seeing their largest gains since November. The Dow (^DJI) rallied for a gain of 379.44 points, or 5.80 percent, to a level of 6,926.49. The S&amp;P 500 (^SPX) added 43.07 points, or 6.37 percent, finishing the session at 719.60. The Nasdaq (^IXIC) tacked on 89.64 points, or 7.07 percent, to 1,358.28. Volume was heavier on the session with 2.19 billion shares traded on the NYSE and 2.42 billion shares exchanging hands on the Naz. Market breadth was positive by a 29-to-2 and 24-to-5 margin on the Big Board and Naz respectively.   A bear market rally broke out Tuesday on rather strong volume, but there still are questions as to whether this strength is the beginning of a tradable rally or if losses will occur Wednesday. It has been since Feb. 5 and Feb. 6 that we have seen a two-day rally for the market. Financials were the leader on the session led by a 38.1 percent rally in shares of Citigroup (C). CEO Vikram Pandit said in a memo that the company made a profit in the first two months of 2009. This news was also a positive for other banks, including Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC), which rallied 18.46 percent and 27.73 percent respectively. The Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) gained 14.86 percent to $7.19.  Fed Chairman Bernanke helped the bulls as well Tuesday, stating that it is important to address the valuation of illiquid assets. He also said that the Fed was considering looking at accounting standards, which also benefited the banking sector. Mr. Bernanke also said that it isn't too early to consider longer-term reforms, such as putting the responsibility for addressing systematic risks with one authority, like the Fed.  General Electric (GE) joined the rally as well Tuesday with the stock up 19.7 percent to $8.87. The stock has taken a major hit of late with traders concerned about GE's financial arm. The stock has a 52-week range from $5.73 to $38.52, with its low occurring just a week ago. Other Dow stocks that saw strong gains included Alcoa (AA), up 13.53 percent and DuPont (DD), which gained 11.03 percent. Dow component United Technologies (UTX) rallied 8.6 percent after announcing it plans on eliminating 11,600 jobs worldwide.  Today's move pushed the SPX back above prior support at 700, though the Dow remains below 7,000. Wednesday's session will say a lot about where stocks are headed in the near term.
