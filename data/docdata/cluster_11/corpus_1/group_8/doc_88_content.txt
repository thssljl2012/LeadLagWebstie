Insurance rates may improve slightly over 2009, but the industry will continue to feel the impact of a global downturn that will continue through the year, a panel of analysts said during a webinar sponsored by the Risk and Insurance Management Society.  ?Pricing will at least stabilize, in our view,? said Jay Cohen, an insurance sector analyst with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. ?I?m not going to go ringing bells, saying prices are turning. Some parts will begin to get better, prices will rise slightly. We are not looking for anything dramatic.?
