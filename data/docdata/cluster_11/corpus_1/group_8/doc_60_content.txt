Triangle Business Journal  Related News  After weeks of taking a battering, stocks were sharply up in trading Tuesday thanks to good news from flagging banking giant Citigroup.  Citigroup (NYSE: C) CEO Vikram Pandit sent a letter to employees saying that the bank has posted an operating profit through the first two months of 2009.
