U.S. stocks resumed their sell-off Thursday, finishing sharply and broadly lower on weakness in financial stocks and General Motors (GM). The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index closed at its lowest level since September, 1996, and the Dow Jones industrial average posted its lowest close since April, 1997.   The sell-off followed a stock-market rally Wednesday -- the first winning session since Feb. 24 -- and preceded Friday's release of the employment report for February, which will likely show no signs of a letup in the labor market's broad decline.   On Thursday, the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average finished lower by 281.40 points, or 4.09%, at 6,594.44. The broad S&amp;P 500 index was down 30.32 points, or 4.25%, at 682.55.

Financial stocks were hit with steep declines, including a drop in Citigroup's (C) stock price to under $1 during the session. The shares finished the session down 9.7% at $1.02.   What's weighing on the market is uncertainty, says Michael Yoshikami, president and chief investment strategist at YCMNET Advisors -- uncertainty about government policy, Friday's jobs report and the possibility of more economic stimulus from the Chinese government. 'The market is pricing in the worst of what could happen in the economy,' Yoshikami says. 'People are just unbelievably concerned.'

Wells Fargo (WFC) shares tumbled after Moody's placed the company's long-term ratings of [senior debt at Aa3] under review for possible downgrade, based on the impact that future credit costs could have on the company's capital ratios; and the rating implications of possible systemic support, and how that support could affect various obligations ranging from deposits to non- cumulative preferred stock.   Moody's also changed its rating outlook on JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and subsidiaries to negative from stable, reflecting Moody's expectations that JPMorgan's results will continue to be saddled by sustained high provisions and credit costs for the coming four-to-six quarters, due to increasing financial strains for U.S. consumers and the global recession.   Also, Moody's placed long-term ratings of Bank of America (BAC) [senior debt at A1] under review for possible downgrade.

In his annual work report on Thursday to the National People's Congress, the largely ceremonial parliament, Wen said the 2009 growth goal was realistic despite a deepening global financial crisis. Wen said 'demand continues to shrink on international markets; the trend toward global deflation is obvious; and trade protectionism is resurgent. The external economic environment has become more serious, and uncertainties have increased significantly.' But he said China's prospects were as bright as ever.
