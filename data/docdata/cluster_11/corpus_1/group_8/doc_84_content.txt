Stock prices declined sharply across the board Monday as financial stocks led the 4 percent sell off. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 299.64 points to 6,763.29, the first close below 7,000 in 11 years. The Nasdaq composite index lost 54.99 points to 1,322.85 and the S&amp;P 500 stock index dropped 34.27 to 700.82. The early decline came after comments by Warren Buffett in his annual letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK) that the economy and financial markets were in 'shambles.' However, he did say 'America's best years lie ahead.' The Commerce Department said that personnel income rose by 0.4 percent in January and spending rose by 0.6 percent, increases that topped expectations. However, the fear that Friday's report on February employment will also be worse than expected, continued to outweigh any good news. Oil prices slide with stocks. Crude closed at $40.15 a barrel, down $4.61. Gold also declined, down $2.50 to $940 an ounce. The metal has fallen 6.2 percent in the past six sessions. The deepening global recession, a third government rescue for Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) and dividend cuts at companies from General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) to JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) have dragged the MSCI World Index to three consecutive weeks of declines. The benchmark has fallen 22 percent this year, adding to last year's 42 percent slump. Options investors are paying twice this decade's average to protect against losses in U.S. stocks through 2011, signaling the bear market that already wiped out $10.4 trillion of equity value may last two more years. Contracts to protect against a drop in the S&amp;P 500 for two years cost $15,160 on the Chicago Board Options Exchange at the end of last week, compared with $6,875 in 2007, according to price-adjusted data compiled by Bloomberg. That shows traders expect the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities to fluctuate twice as much in the next two years as it has since 2000. 'There's a real panic in the markets, with some people wanting to buy long-term insurance at any price,' said Peter Sorrentino, who helps manage $16 billion, including $130 million in options at Huntington Asset Advisors Inc. in Cincinnati. 'People have lost hope.' Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares lost $120 to $2,444. Berkshire, which owns stakes in companies from Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) to American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP), posted a fifth-straight profit drop, the longest streak of quarterly declines in at least 17 years, on losses from derivative bets tied to stock markets. About 12.9 billion shares changed hands on all U.S. exchanges, 33 percent more than the three-month daily average. The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index is known, gained 14 percent to 52.65, the most since Jan. 20. The index measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines in the S&amp;P 500. Financial stocks in the MSCI World Index dropped 6.9 percent, leading all 10 industries lower. Citigroup decreased 20 percent to $1.20. PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (NYSE: PNC) slipped 4.5 percent to $26.12. The fifth-largest U.S. bank by deposits slashed its dividend 85 percent, to 10 cents from 66 cents, to save $1 billion amid 'extreme market deterioration.' International Paper Co. (NYSE: IP) had the steepest decline in a month, losing 10 percent to $5.12. The world's largest maker of cardboard boxes and office paper cut its quarterly dividend to 2.5 cents a share from 25 cents. Aggregate dividends by S&amp;P 500 companies will fall 23 percent this year, the biggest decline since 1938, S&amp;P predicts. More than 288 U.S. companies cut or suspended payouts last quarter, the most since S&amp;P records began 54 years ago. GE, once the S&amp;P 500's biggest dividend payer, slid 11 percent to $7.60. The only stock left in the Dow Jones Industrial Average from its creation in 1896 is adding to investor pessimism as credit analysts threaten to reduce its AAA rating. The company cut its quarterly dividend by 68 percent, to 10 cents from 31 cents, last week. GE, whose Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt bought 50,000 shares at $8.26 each on Monday, pushed a measure of industrial stocks in the MSCI World to a 5.5 percent loss. American International Group Inc. (NYSE: AIG) was unchanged at 42 cents. The insurer deemed too important to fail will get as much as $30 billion in new government aid in a revised bailout after posting a record loss. Raw-material producers and energy stocks in the MSCI World Index slid more than 6 percent. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities fell 5.3 percent, the steepest loss since October. Oil retreated $4.61 to settle at $40.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The MSCI EM Eastern Europe Index slumped 3.8 percent to 88.44. European Union leaders rejected requests for a region- wide aid package, bowing to German concerns that it would put too much pressure on budget deficits in western Europe as the economy slumps.
