CHARLOTTE, N.C. - Investors remained cautious of national and regional banks Friday, as another big bank slashed its dividend to buffer itself against future losses.  The KBW Bank Index, which tracks 24 of the nation's largest banks, fell 5 percent to 18.02 in afternoon trading Friday.  Following the lead of other major banks, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. slashed its quarterly dividend by 85 percent to 5 cents from 34 cents in an effort to save $5 billion annually. Its shares were up nearly 4 percent.  Wells Fargo bought Wachovia Corp. and has become the dominant bank in Philadelphia and dozens of other markets.  Affirming an 'outperform' rating on the stock, Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst Andrew Marquardt said in a research note he views the dividend cut 'positively' given the 'tough environment' for banks.  Earlier in the week, Marquardt said the San Francisco-based bank should slash its dividend to help repay the government's $25 billion investment in the company.  Shares of Wells Fargo edged up 29 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $8.41 in late afternoon trading, but it was the exception to the day's trend for bank stocks.  With the recession deepening, loan losses are widely expected to continue to rise from already elevated levels. Dividend cuts have been one option for making up for such losses.  Last month, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. cut its quarterly dividend to 5 cents from 38 cents. In January, Bank of America Corp. slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny from 32 cents. And troubled Citigroup Inc. has lowered its quarterly dividend to a penny from 16 cents.  Shares of Bank of America fell 12 cents, or 3.8 percent, to $3.05 in late afternoon trading and Citigroup was steady at $1.02 after sinking to a new low of 97 cents on Thursday.  JPMorgan lost $1.2, or 7.4 percent, to $15.38.  Citi has been among the hardest hit by the ongoing financial crisis. Last week, the government restructured its support for the bank, increasing its stake to more than 30 percent.  U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. cut their dividends earlier this week. Other smaller regional banks have made similar moves.  U.S. Bancorp lost 52 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $8.49 Friday afternoon after sinking to a 52-week low of $8.25 earlier in the session. PNC Financial lost $2.45, or 12.3 percent, to $17.55.  Regional banks were also lower. Shares of Regions Financial Corp. fell 29 cents, or 9.4 percent to $2.81; SunTrust Banks Inc. lost 85 cents, or 8.6 percent, to $8.97; Fifth Third Bancorp fell 11 cents, or 8 percent, to $1.26.
