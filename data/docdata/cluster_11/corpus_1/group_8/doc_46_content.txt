Email Address:  David Pett, The Financial Post  Canada's main exchange put an exclamation mark on its best week in recent memory, closing in positive territory for the fourth straight day as sentiment about the economy continues to turn for the better.  Despite some profit taking that dragged stocks lower during mid-session trading, the S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index was able to eke out a small gain yesterday, rising 21.12 points, or 0.25%, to 8303.39. Since hitting a bear market closing low of 7566.94 on Monday, stocks in Toronto were up 9.7%, extending its best rally since November.  The TSX Venture Exchange also climbed, closing up 5.55 points, or 0.7%, to 848.97.  The Canadian dollar climbed 38 basis points to US$0.7856.  Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets Canada, says bankruptcy fears that have been overhanging stocks for months have started to dissipate now that General Motors Corp., for one, and several U.S. banks, for another, appear to be in better shape than originally believed.  'Fears may be easing as buying accelerated dramatically [Thursday] after General Motors lowered its bailout request for March by US$2-billion. With both Citi- bank and Bank of America indicating they don't need any additional government money, equity markets may continue to play catch-up.  'Don't forget that not needing government cash can be viewed as a sign of strength or, at least, stabilization. Although ongoing risks to companies and the overall economy remain, sentiment may improve if more anecdotal information appears to suggest that investors' worst fears, [which seem to have been priced into indices,] may not be realized.' The Toronto market was propped up by another relatively strong day for financials, which climbed 0.89%. Manulife Financial Corp., which has been clobbered in the last year due to concerns about its financial markets exposure, climbed another 11 to bring its one-week return to near 25%. The materials group was also higher, rising 1% as gold prices jumped US$6.10 to US$930.10 an ounce. Energy stocks weighed down the TSX, falling 0.61%. Oil prices, which gave up US$0.78 to US$46.25 a barrel, were the cause.  In the U.S., stocks also inched higher yesterday.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 53.92 points, or 0.75%, to 7223.98.  The S&amp;P 500 advanced 5.81 points, or 0.77%, to 756.55 and the NASDAQ Composite Index gained 5.40 points, or 0.38%, to 1431.50. All three exchanges were up more than 10% for the week after hitting bear market closing lows on Monday. Financials stocks rose again, extending their biggest rally since 1989, while the health-care group also gained on more M&amp;A speculation.   The Windsor Star 2009
