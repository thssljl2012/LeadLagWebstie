U.S. stock market report 1350 ET 11March2009-Citi bullish on coal, sees CApp pricing floor ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Citi on Wednesday reiterated its buy rating on two coal companies, Foundation Coal and Consol Energy, saying that the cost advantage of their Northern Appalachia production assets would results in high margins.  'While some producers currently trade above this distressed net asset value test, implying cyclical discounting of a recovery, others such as Foundation and Consol are trading well below, pointing to a buying opportunity for investors willing to look beyond the trading noise.'  The firm also said that while Central Appalachia (CApp) coal prices had fallen along with other commodities, it saw a pricing floor for them, expecting that they wouldn't drop below the mid-$60s because of cost reasons.  The Dow Jones U.S. Coal Index slid 1.2 percent to 152.23 on Wednesday.
