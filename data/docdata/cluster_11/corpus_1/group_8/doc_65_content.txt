NEW YORK - Stocks rose at the open on Friday as a climb in commodity prices sent shares of natural resource companies higher, offsetting more bleak news about the labor market.Wells Fargo was among standouts after the major U.S. bank cut its dividend to preserve capital. The stock was up more than 6 percent to $8.61.  Government data showed the U.S. unemployment rate surged to its highest in 25 years last month as companies buckled under the strain of a recession that shows no signs of abating. Even so, analysts said the bleak news may already have been discounted.  The Dow Jones industrial average  rose 57.83 points, or 0.88 percent, to 6,652.27. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index  gained 6.54 points, or 0.96 percent, to 689.09. The Nasdaq Composite Index  added 10.04 points, or 0.77 percent, to 1,309.63.  (Editing by James Dalgleish)
