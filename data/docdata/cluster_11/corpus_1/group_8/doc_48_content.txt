Stocks made modest gains this afternoon, extending a large rally yesterday that wiped away more than a week's worth of losses.   After surging almost 6 percent yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average was flat, up 4 points. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index was up 0.2 percent, or 2 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 1 percent, or 13 points.   Wall Street rallied yesterday after Citigroup announced it had made an operating profit during the first two months of the year. Investors also cheered signs federal regulators could restrain short selling of stocks, a type of trading blamed by some in the financial services industry for dragging down shares.   It comes as Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said the Obama administration would ask Congress to expand the United States' primary line of credit to the International Monetary to boost emergency support for struggling economies around the world. Under the proposal, the IMF would be able to borrow up to $500 billion to bail out countries in crisis.   Analysts were hoping that yesterday's rally could mean the market has stabilized and would continue to move in positive territory. But it is not unusual for Wall Street to fall after a large rally as investors sell off shares to lock in profits. Stocks wavered between positive and negative territory most of the day. It has been more than a month since Wall Street has seen back-to-back gains. 'Market participants appear to be a bit nervous having been burned by so many bear rallies in the past,' said Joseph Brusuelas, a director at Moody's Economy.com.   A key indicator of the rally's sustainability will be the market's reaction to new economic data tomorrow, including unemployment claims and retail sales, he said. 'We have real economic news tomorrow,' Brusuelas said. 'Given the difficulties in the economy this may be another one of those temporary multiweek rallies followed by another extended period of weakness in equities.' Bank stocks that led the rally yesterday continued to show gains early today, but lost steam in the afternoon. Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase were up 6.2 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively. Bank of America was up 2.1 percent.   Morgan Stanley was up 8 percent after Goldman Sachs analysts upgraded its stock. Morgan Stanley's high capital puts it in a good position to outperform its peers and repay government aid it has received, the Goldman report said.   But Goldman downgraded American Express in the same report, citing increasing delinquency rates among some cardholders. It 'seems the card industry has a target on its back,' the report said. American Express stock was down 2 percent.   Crude oil prices fell more than 7 percent to $42 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the Energy Department reported the inventory of crude oil grew unexpectedly last week. That means that demand is lower than expected, analysts said.   Also, traders have also become concerned that OPEC will not cut production again, said Phil Flynn, oil analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago. 'We're in a situation where demand isn't good,' Flynn said. And there are mixed messages from OPEC. 'OPEC was expected to cut production in their March meeting but now maybe we're not so sure,' he said. That helped send energy stocks down. Exxon Mobil fell 2.4 percent and Chevron was down nearly 1 percent.   Overseas stocks were mixed. London's FTSE and the Dax in Germany were down 0.6 percent and up 0.7 percent, respectively. Japan's Nikkei surged 4.6 percent.
