NEW YORK, March 10 (Reuters) - If the U.S. government assumes greater control over U.S. bank Citigroup or automaker General Motors, that might 'trigger' their removal from the Dow, the Dow Jones Indexes said on Tuesday.   John Prestbo, editor and executive director of the DJ Indexes, which selects the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, said he tracks both companies 'every day to see what the status is.' Should either stock be removed, 'everything is on the table basically in terms of replacements,' Prestbo said, adding that the financial sector's weight in the Dow was 'a bit light' compared to the overall market.  Despite billions in government aid, both Citi and GM trade below $2 and some analysts say the two stocks are likely to be replaced.
