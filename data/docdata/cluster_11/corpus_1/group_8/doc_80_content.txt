NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose at the open on Friday as a climb in commodity prices sent shares of natural resource companies higher, offsetting more bleak news about the labor market.  A day after stocks extended their slide to 12-year lows, a search for beaten-down shares and a rise in energy prices served to cushion the market, with U.S. front-month crude up more than 3 percent.  Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC - News) was among standouts after the major U.S. bank cut its dividend to preserve capital. The stock was up more than 6 percent to $8.61.  Government data showed the U.S. unemployment rate surged to its highest in 25 years last month as companies buckled under the strain of a recession that shows no signs of abating. Even so, analysts said the bleak news may already have been discounted.  The Dow Jones industrial average (DJI:^DJI - News) rose 57.83 points, or 0.88 percent, to 6,652.27. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index (^SPX - News) gained 6.54 points, or 0.96 percent, to 689.09. The Nasdaq Composite Index (Nasdaq:^IXIC - News) added 10.04 points, or 0.77 percent, to 1,309.63.
