Stocks on the move Real-Time Equity news U.S. stock market report 1006 ET 06March2009-GE rises, analysts say big write-offs unlikely ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Shares of General Electric rose on Friday, after analysts said they didn't see the conglomerate sharply marking down assets in its finance arm in the near term. Bernstein research said that while parts of GE could be overstating the value of some of its assets, he didn't see a need for immediate action. 'We think such write-downs, if needed, would be spread over several years, which will lessen the need for equity raises, but will hurt long-term earnings,' the firm wrote. Shares of GE, a Dow component, rose 4.8 percent to $6.98.

'With the current economic downturn's depth and breadth unknown, we think it's too early to go 'all-in' with a basket approach to railroads,' the firm wrote. 'Our below-consensus estimates argue for more conservative posturing in 2009.' The firm added that 'in times of uncertainty, we strongly believe culture is king and execution is everything,' giving buy ratings on Canadian National Railway and Norfolk Southern, 'which we see offering the most defensive characteristics through the downturn and structural upside into the earlier stages of a recovery.' Citi gave hold ratings on CSX Corp, Union Pacific, Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Canadian Pacific Railway, 'as reasonable valuations should provide support.'
