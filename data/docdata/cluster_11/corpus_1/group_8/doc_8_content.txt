The benchmark Ibovespa stocks index ended 5.59% higher to close at 38,794 points on the Brazilian Stock Exchange, or Bovespa.   Trading volume was 4.5 billion Brazilian reals, or $1.91 billion, also one of the highest daily transaction volumes registered this year. Normal days have averaged around BRL3.5 billion ever since deleveraging of global emerging market assets began in full force in October.   The Ibovespa had closed at these levels in late February as well but was even higher at the start of the February.   Tuesday's rally brought Brazil's benchmark stocks back to positive territory. The Ibovespa ended Tuesday 3.31% higher than it started on Jan. 1.   Brazilian stocks started the day in positive territory on news that Citigroup Inc.'s (C) chief executive had written in a memo to employees that the troubled U.S. bank has been profitable since January and was having its best quarter performance since the third quarter of 2007. That was enough to animate investors of financial services and banking stocks.   Brazil's biggest bank shares outperformed the Ibovespa all day. Itau Bank (ITU) settled 6.32% higher to BRL23.20 and Bradesco (BBD) settled 6.02% higher at BRL21.49.   Chinese economic indicators on production and automotive sales showed signs of improvement. Even if that improvement is a mere snapshot in time, China stock indexes all settled much higher, propelling investors into other emerging markets.   Brazil is widely considered a backdoor entry into Chinese markets, as it is a major supplier of metals and agricultural commodities to China.   Brazilian steel and iron ore companies outperformed as a result.   Vale do Rio Doce (RIO) shares settled 6.2% higher at BRL27.37. Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (SID), a steel exporter, closed 7.8% higher to BRL33.10 and Usiminas (USIM5.BR) settled 6.23% higher to BRL24.72.   Some disappointing data in Brazil was released Tuesday, but investors saw that as a means for the government to make major cuts in interest rates Wednesday.   Fourth-quarter gross domestic product showed a 3.6% contraction from third-quarter GDP. Most estimates put it between 2.5% to 3% lower.   The central bank's monetary policy committee is currently meeting to discuss interest-rate direction. Investors are expecting a minimum of 100 basis points, though general consensus is that a 150-basis-point cut is possible.   A rate cut of that size could provide impetus for consumers to spend and spur corporate investment in production. Lower rates also tend to pull investments out of fixed income funds and into equity funds in Brazil.   Other big gainers on the day included oil company Petrobras (PBR), up 5.3% to BRL27.07 and Tele Norte Leste Participacoes (TNE), a large telcom, up 6.7% to BRL37.35. Klabin (KLBN4), a paper and pulp company, rose 8.08% to BRL2.81 in active trade, as well.   Demand for Vale and Petrobras shares continued after market, as well, with buyers still trading 45 minutes after closing.   -By Kenneth Rapoza, Dow Jones Newswires; (5511) 8812-5961; kenneth.rapoza@dowjones.com   (END) Dow Jones Newswires   03-10-09 1655ET
