(NYQ:BAC) on concern it may have to sell new shares to balance out debt levels after a recent acquisition.  Cosan fell 7.6 percent to $2.66 at 1:14 p.m. in New York. Brazilian depositary receipts of the Bermuda-based company dropped 9.8 percent in Sao Paulo trading.  Piracicaba, Brazil-based Cosan SA Industria &amp; Comercio agreed to buy Nova America SA Agroenergia for an undisclosed price. Cosan will take on 1.15 billion reais ($505 million) of Nova Americas debt as part of the transaction and is in talks with banks to extend most of the debt for five years, according to an e-mailed statement sent March 12.  Leverage remains our key concern in the sector, and we downgrade Cosan Ltd. (CZZ) from neutral to underperform, wrote Felipe Hirai, an analyst based in New York. The companys total debt of 4.8 billion reais, about four times estimated 2010 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, should be a concern for investors, given the still-challenging outlook for the credit markets.  Cosan Ltd. may sell new equity if leverage remains high, he wrote.  Cosan Ltd. and operating unit Cosan SA may have their BB- rating cut at Standard &amp; Poors, which cited increased financial leverage and uncertainty regarding current market trends and their effect on profitability and cash flows.  Cosan SA rose 0.2 percent in Sao Paulo trading.  NYQ:BAC     Bank of America Corp.
