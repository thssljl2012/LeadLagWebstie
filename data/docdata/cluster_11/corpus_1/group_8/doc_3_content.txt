NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services said Monday that it affirmed its supported 'A-/A-1' counterparty credit rating on American International Group Inc.  (AIG:  AIG  News , chart , profile , more  Last:  Delayed quote data  Add to portfolio  Analyst  Create alert  Insider  Discuss  Financials  Sponsored by:  , , )  and its 'A+' counterparty credit and financial strength ratings on AIG's insurance subsidiaries. The outlook on all these companies is negative. 'The negative outlook reflects our view that increased pressure on the performance of AIG's insurance businesses is likely. We believe AIG is particularly susceptible to these broader market trends given its somewhat weakened position. ... If AIG's business were to stabilize and government support continues, we would consider revising the outlook to stable,' the report said.
