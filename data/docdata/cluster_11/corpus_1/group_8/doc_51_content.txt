In addition, it said, 'energy typically outperforms from February though September.  'Not all signals are positive, but evidence suggests that this higher beta group can perform well during a market rally and is no longer likely to disappoint investors significantly.'  At the same time, Citi downgraded the pharma and biotech group to underweight from market weight. 'The group has proven to be defensive and thus has protected investors to some degree in the current equity price freefall. Yet, unattractive valuation, a worsening political environment for the industry and most favored status by sell-side analysts all indicate that a shift in weighting is appropriate,' it wrote.
