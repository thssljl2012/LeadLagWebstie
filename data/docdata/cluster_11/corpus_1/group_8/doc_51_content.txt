 MEXICO CITY, March 11 (Reuters) - Mexico's peso rose for a second day in a row on Wednesday and stocks rose, buoyed by expectations that Washington will act soon to restore confidence in banks by relieving them of money-losing assets. The peso MEX01 strengthened 0.58 percent to 15.182 per dollar while the IPC stock index .MXX rose 1.16 percent at 17,747.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner pledged on Tuesday in a television interview to 'do what is necessary' to jolt the economy out of recession and promised action within weeks to help stabilize banks.  That followed comments from Citigroup (C.N  Any support for U.S. banks and the wider economy bodes well for Mexico, which sends around 80 percent of its exports to its northern neighbor. 'Markets could begin to cheer up following the report from Citigroup, but don't rule out volatility when they publish the next negative story regarding the U.S. financial sector,' wrote Jaime Ascencio, an analyst at Actinver brokerage in Mexico City.  The peso has lost more than a third of its value against the dollar since August as investors have grown increasingly pessimistic about the Mexican economy as the U.S. recession deepens.
