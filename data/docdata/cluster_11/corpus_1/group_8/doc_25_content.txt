NEW YORK (AFP) - An explosive rally propelled Wall Street higher Tuesday after troubled banking giant Citigroup's upbeat profit outlook and encouraging comments from Washington prompted a stock-buying frenzy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average vaulted 379.44 points (5.80 percent) to close at 6,926.49, as blue chips rebounded strongly from 12-year lows Monday. The tech-dominated Nasdaq leapt 89.64 points (7.07 percent) to 1,358.28 while the broad-market Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rallied 43.07 points (6.37 percent) to 719.60. The rebound came after an internal memo showed struggling US banking giant Citigroup is seeing a return to profitability in early 2009 after punishing losses last year. Chief executive Vikram Pandit said Citi has been profitable for the first two months of 2009 and was having its 'best quarter-to-date performance since the third quarter of 2007.' 'Wall Street was in dire need of some good news, and Citigroup delivered,' said Joseph Hargett at Schaeffer's Investment Research. Others noted that the market was encouraged by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke's calls for tighter regulation of financial markets and comments from a key lawmaker indicating regulators would tighten up a loophole that allows speculators to drive down share prices. 'Bernanke announced a new rule book will be written for the financial world, in an effort to keep this financial crisis from repeating itself,' said Tom Lydon, president of Global Trends Investments. Lydon said the market also brightened on comments by House of Representatives Financial Services chief Barney Frank indicating regulators would restore the so-called 'uptick rule' that prevents speculators from piling on to short positions as a stock is falling. 'This is great news among a stream of bad news, however, analysts do not dare say the markets are at a turning point,' Lydon said. Other global markets also joined the spirited rally. London' FTSE 100 index added 4.88 percent to finish at 3,715.23, while the Paris CAC 40 soared 5.75 percent to 2,663.68, and in Frankfurt the Dax jumped 5.28 percent to 3,886.98. 'There is a sense that we have moved on from complete Armageddon in the financials and banking stocks,' said Manus Cranny, senior market commentator at MF Global Spreads. 'Citigroup's positive comments about the first two months of 2009 reminds (the market) that even with investment banking being decimated, banks will produce revenue.' But other analysts urged caution, with Yves Marcais of Global Equities contending that there was 'no particular reason for the gain.' Added Alice Lhabouz of Turgot Asset Management: 'It's clearly a technical rebound.' Among key US stocks, Citigroup led the gains with a surge of 38 percent to 1.45 dollars, after hovering near the one-dollar mark in recent days. Elsewhere in the financial arena, Bank of America rallied 27.7 percent to 4.79 dollars, JPMorgan Chase added 22.6 percent to 19.50 dollars and Wells Fargo advanced 18.5 percent to 11.64 dollars. Delta Air Lines climbed 13.3 percent to 4.74 after the leading US carrier said it was cutting international capacity by an additional 10 percent. Among other stocks in focus, United Technologies Corp. increased 8.6 percent to 40.79 dollars as the manufacturer of aerospace systems, elevators and helicopters said it would cut 11,600 jobs worldwide to remain competitive. Dow Chemical rose 8.5 percent to 6.87 dollars after reaching an agreement to end a legal dispute and complete its planned merger with rival Rohm &amp; Haas, up 5.3 percent at 78.00. Bonds fell as investor fears eased. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond increased to 2.982 percent from 2.886 percent Monday and that on the 30-year bond climbed to 3.707 percent against 3.593 percent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.
