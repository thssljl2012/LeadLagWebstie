Barclays shares soared on Tuesday amid reports it may join the UK Treasury's asset insurance scheme. The bank has submitted three portfolios of assets worth less than 10bn to the Treasury for consideration, the Financial Times reported, adding the Treasury plans to open discussions with the bank over the coming days.  Its share price had surged more than 17% by mid-afternoon, with other financials also comfortably in the black. The moves helped push the FTSE above 3,660, a gain of 119 points, or 3.26%.  Banks have until 31 March to decide whether to join the asset protection scheme, which insures so-called 'toxic' loans. Elsewhere, Investec, Legal &amp; General and Prudential all toasted near 16% gains as the financials sector was given a much-needed boost.  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recouped Monday's losses in double-quick time as Citi's profit outlook fuelled confidence the worst of the banking crisis is over.  Citigroup advanced 25% after CEO Vikram Pandit revealed the firm was enjoying its best quarter for two years.  Bank of America also climbed 25% while JPMorgan Chase rode the wave of optimism to jump 16%. The Dow Jones advanced more than 250 points, or 3.8%, to reach 6,801 shortly after opening.
