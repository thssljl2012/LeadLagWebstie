NEW YORK  Traders weren't taking any chances Friday, sending stock futures lower ahead of what's likely to be another unnerving reading on the job market.  The Labour Department is expected to report that employers cut 648,000 jobs in February, according to economists polled by Thomson Reuters/IFR. That would be more than the 598,000 shed in January. The unemployment rate is expected to jump to 7.9 per cent from 7.6 per cent.  With companies across all industries clobbered by weak consumer spending and loan defaults, the last thing investors want to hear is that Americans are getting laid off at a faster-than-anticipated pace.  A better-than-expected jobs number could attract buyers back into the market, especially given that the Dow Jones industrial average has already lost 6.6 per cent so far this week. But the market has been plummeting through barrier after barrier  the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index tumbled more than 4 per cent Thursday to its lowest close since September 1996. And many analysts believe there is little keeping stocks from falling even further.  Ahead of the market's opening, Dow Jones industrial average futures sank 49 points, or 0.74 per cent, to 6,582. Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index futures fell 4.60, or 0.67 per cent, to 681.50, and Nasdaq 100 index futures fell 6.00, or 0.55 per cent, to 1,077.00.  Government bond prices rose. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, slipped to 2.77 per cent from 2.81 per cent late Thursday. The yield on the three-month T-bill, a popular safe haven for anxious investors, fell to 0.17 per cent from 0.20 per cent.  Gold prices rose as the dollar weakened against other major currencies.  Light, sweet crude rose 65 cents to $44.26 a barrel in electronic pre-market trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Markets overseas declined. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 3.50 per cent, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 2.37 per cent. In late morning trading, Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.17 per cent, Germany's DAX index was down 0.51 per cent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.82 per cent.
