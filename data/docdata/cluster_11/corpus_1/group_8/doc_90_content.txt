 - Stocks are set to open higher after a report showing job losses that were huge, but not as horrific as many traders feared. The Labor Department said Friday employers cut 651,00 jobs last month, and the unemployment rate jumped to 8.1 percent. The government also upwardly revised its December and January job loss figures to 681,000 and 655,000, respectively.   The readings were worse than consensus estimates. But many market participants had braced for even grimmer data, shorting stocks earlier in the week, so stock futures pared losses and turned higher ahead of the market's open Friday. To short a stock means to bet it will fall.   The market has been plummeting this week through barrier after barrier-the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index tumbled more than 4 percent Thursday to its lowest close since September 1996.   Though stocks might regain ground Friday given that the Dow Jones industrial average has already tumbled 6.6 percent this week, many analysts believe there is little keeping stocks from falling further The market had 'anticipated bad news, and we got it,' said Rob Lutts, president of Cabot Money Management. But 'my sense is we haven't discounted all the negatives out there as of yet.' Investors have to account for not only the gloomy data coming out from the government and companies, but also the pessimism of other participants in the market, Lutts said. 'It's not a scientific process by which stock prices are set,' he said. 'They're set by people. People are extremely emotional beings.' Ahead of the market's opening, Dow futures rose 30 points, or 0.45 percent, to 6,661. Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index futures rose 2.40, or 0.35 percent, to 683.20, and Nasdaq 100 index futures rose 6.00, or 0.55 percent, to 1,089.00.   The Dow and S&amp;P are down nearly 25 percent year-to-date now. Thursday's selloff came as China shot down the market's hope for additional stimulus, Citigroup Inc. stock dropped below $1 a share, and worries escalated about a possible General Motors Corp. bankruptcy.   As banks continue to weaken, they are slashing their dividends. Following last week's move by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. to cut its dividend to 5 cents a share, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. on Friday lowered its own quarterly dividend to 5 cents a share from 35 cents. Citigroup and Bank of America Corp. had already slashed their quarterly dividends to a penny per share.   Wells Fargo shares rose 8.7 percent in premarket trading.   Government bond prices turned lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, rose to 2.84 percent from 2.81 percent late Thursday. The yield on the three-month T-bill, a popular safe haven for anxious investors, rose to 0.21 percent from 0.20 percent.   Gold prices advanced as the dollar weakened against other major currencies.   Light, sweet crude rose 93 cents to $44.54 a barrel in electronic pre-market trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   Asian markets, which closed before the U.S. jobs report was released, fell. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 3.50 percent, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 2.37 percent.   European markets turned higher in afternoon trading. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.37 percent, Germany's DAX index rose 0.79 percent, and France's CAC-40 was rose 0.17 percent.   ___   On the Net:   New York Stock Exchange: http://www.nyse.com   Nasdaq Stock Market: http://www.nasdaq.com
