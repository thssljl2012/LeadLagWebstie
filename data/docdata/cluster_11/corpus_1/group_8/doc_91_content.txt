New York: Treasuries declined as traders focused on the $63 billion (Dh321.37 billion) in notes and bonds to be sold gthis week after a government report showed the economy shed jobs and unemployment climbed to the highest level in over 25 years.  US debt has handed investors a 2.5 per cent loss so far this year as the nation embarks on the sale of more than $2 trillion in debt to steer the nation out of recession. Federal Reserve President William Dudley said buying Treasuries are not the best step, dampening speculation the central bank may purchase government securities. 'The flight to quality and risk reduction trade seems to be completely overwhelmed by the announcements of further Treasury borrowings,' said Christopher Sullivan, who oversees $1.3 billion as CEO at United Nations Federal Credit Union in New York. The yield on the 10-year note rose five basis points to 2.86 per cent at 2.05 pm in New York, according to BGCantor Market Data. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The 2.75 per cent security maturing in February 2019 fell 13/32, or $4.06 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 1/32.  The benchmark 10-year note was still headed for its biggest weekly advance this year. The yield has dropped 15 basis points. It reached 2.76 per cent earlier, the lowest level since February 24.  The rate on the one-month bill dropped as low as 0.08 per cent, while that on the three-month bill was at 0.19 per cent, from 0.25 per cent a week ago. The rates turned negative in December as investors sought the safest assets on concern the recession is deepening.  The US plans to sell $34 billion of three-year notes on March 10, $18 billion in 10-year notes the next day and $11 billion in 30-year bonds on March 12. The auctions follow $94 billion of note sales last week. 'You have this continuous tug-of-war between economic data that is trying to move the Treasury market higher, and then you have that lingering supply which has been the thorn in the Treasury market's side,' said Sean Simko, who oversees $8 billion at SEI Investments Co in Oaks, Pennsylvania. 'The supply overall has been winning.' US securities will drop in the second quarter, pushing the 10-year yield to 3.25 per cent by mid-year, Merrill Lynch economists including David Rosenberg in New York wrote in a note on Thursday.  The impact of the relentless flood of Treasury supply, will help increase borrowing costs, the report said. Merrill is part of Bank of America Corp, one of 16 primary dealers required to bid at Treasury auctions.  President Barack Obama's administration is seeking congressional approval for a budget of $3.55 trillion for the fiscal year beginning in October.
