The firm kept its below-consensus estimates on the company, and acknowledged that there could be downward revisions to consensus estimates, but said 'we believe this is largely factored into the stock and believe that if HP can deliver an in-line quarter it would act as a positive catalyst.' The firm added that 'we believe there is value in HP and think the recent pullback has made shares attractive. We believe investors with a longer-term view stand to benefit from being long shares at current levels.' Shares of HP, a Dow component, rose 3.1 percent to $27.89 in premarket trade.

Marking down the portfolios would make it easier for them to post gains fresh out of the gate in January, the paper reported. Andrew Cuomo, the attorney general of New York, has been investigating whether the billions of dollars that were paid in executive bonuses at Merrill ahead of its takeover by Bank of America were sanctioned by the bank.
