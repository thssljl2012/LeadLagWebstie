US stocks powered higher overnight after troubled banking giant Citigroup offered an upbeat profit outlook, prompting a frenzied rush into shares beaten down by the grinding bear market.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average shot up 246.91 points (3.77 per cent) to 6793.96 in morning trading rebounding from 12-year lows hit yesterday.   The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite climbed 61.05 points (4.81 per cent) to 1329.69 and the broad-market Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 28.17 points (4.16 per cent) to 704.70.  The rebound came as an internal memo showed struggling US banking giant Citigroup is seeing a return to profitability in early 2009 after punishing losses last year.  Chief executive Vikram Pandit said Citi has been profitable for the first two months of 2009 and was having its 'best quarter-to-date performance since the third quarter of 2007'. 'Wall Street was in dire need of some good news, and Citigroup delivered,' said Joseph Hargett at Schaeffer's Investment Research.   Patrick O'Hare at Briefing.com said the market seized on what would ordinarily be routine news from Citi. 'The outsized response to what would be an innocuous event under normal market conditions is a reflection of the short-term oversold state of the market,' he said. 'Any whiff of seemingly good news can give certain stocks a big boost, particularly since this isn't a normal market.' Citigroup led the banking sector higher, which lifted the broader market. Citi jumped 23.8 per cent to $US1.30, after hovering near the $US1 mark in recent days.   Elsewhere in the financial arena, Bank of America rallied 22.9 per cent to $US4.61, JPMorgan Chase added 16.3 per cent to $US18.50 and Wells Fargo advanced 9.4 per cent to $US10.91.  Delta Air Lines climbed 8.0 per cent to 4.52 after the leading US carrier said it was cutting international capacity by an additional 10 per cent.   Among other stocks in focus, United Technologies Corp. increase 6.7 per cent to $US40.06 as the manufacturer of aerospace systems, elevators and helicopters said it would cut 11,600 jobs worldwide.   Dow Chemical rose 3.5 per cent to $US6.55 after reaching an agreement to end a legal dispute and complete its planned merger with rival Rohm &amp; Haas, up 4.9 per cent at 77.64.  Bonds fell as investor fears eased. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond increased to 2.956 per cent from 2.886 per cent yesterday and that on the 30-year bond climbed to 3.676 per cent against 3.593 per cent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.
