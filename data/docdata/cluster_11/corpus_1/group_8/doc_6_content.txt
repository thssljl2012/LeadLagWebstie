With little good economic news or direction from Washington, the pessimism on Wall Street intensified Monday, sending stocks lower.  The market seesawed early in the session as investors were torn between hopes for the financial sector and fears about the broader economy's slide. But stocks turned moderately lower in the afternoon, following a now familiar pattern where short-lived bursts of optimism give way to concerns about the country's economic woes.  With little in the way of corporate and economic news, investors floundered. 'There is really not very much for the market to sink its teeth into,' said Steve Sachs, director of trading at Rockville, Md.-based Rydex Investments.  Financial stocks, however, were the one exception, maintaining their early gains as other industries faltered. Banks rallied on a news report that Bank of America Corp. could raise capital in the private sector. Shares of major banks have been pummeled to multiyear lows amid growing concern that they don't have enough cash to cover future losses despite multiple government rescues. 'Any bank right now that can raise money in the private sector, that is a major positive for the market,' said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford. 'It's another way to raise capital rather than the government infusing capital into the banks.' Among the day's downbeat news, newspaper publisher McClatchy Co. said it plans to eliminate 1,600 jobs, or 15 percent of its work force, as it battles declining advertising revenue.  Investors were also mindful of remarks from billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who said during an appearance on CNBC that the economy has 'fallen off a cliff' over the past six months. He noted that consumers have changed their habits in remarkable ways.  In early afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 52.17, or 0.8 percent, to 6,574.77.  The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell 3.15, or 0.5 percent, to 680.23, while the Nasdaq composite index fell 15.63, or 1.2 percent, to 1,278.22.
