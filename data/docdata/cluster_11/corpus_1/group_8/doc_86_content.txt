Good news from a bank -- finally -- sent the stock market to its best gain this year.  The Dow Jones industrial average soared almost 400 points after Citigroup Inc.'s chief executive said the troubled banking company was profitable through the first two months of this year and is having its best quarter since the third quarter of 2007. 'I am most encouraged with the strength of our business so far in 2009,' Vikram Pandit, Citigroup's CEO, wrote in a memo to employees.  That raised hope that the financial sector could be nearing a bottom, and it unleashed a broad rally among financial stocks. Citigroup shares jumped more than 36% -- though with the shares starting the day at just $1.05, that amounted to only a 38-cent gain.  Bank of America Corp. shares ballooned 26% and JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. surged 22%.  The Dow ended up 379.44 points, or 5.8%, at 6,926.49.  The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index jumped 43.07 points, or 6.4%, to 719.60. The Nasdaq composite index led the way, leaping 89.64 points, or 7.1%, to 1,358.28.  Investors also were buoyed by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicating that the Federal Reserve was looking into accounting rules for illiquid assets, raising hope that banks stuck with toxic assets might get some form of accounting relief.  The U.S. rally fed on a strong move overseas, with European shares rising between 5% and 7%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index advancing 3.1%.  The gains came in part because of so-called short covering as investors who had wagered on further declines had to reverse their bets.  walter.hamilton@latimes.com
