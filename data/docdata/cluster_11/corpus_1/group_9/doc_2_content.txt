1116 ET 01April2009-GFT: markets becoming more pessimistic  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  GFT on Wednesday wrote that despite some positive economic data, 'it feels  like there has been a change in sentiment: some pessimism has returned to the  equity markets after the storming rallies seen in March.  'The concern is that the selling momentum will pick up and drive us back to  the previous lows and beyond,' it added. 'As expectations from G20 have been  spun down successfully, all eyes will be on Friday's nonfarm payroll numbers.'  Among recent economic indicators, February pending home sales were better  than expected, as was March factory data, though the most recent ADP report was  weaker than expected.

The shares are struggling, one day after its new chief executive said  there there was a rising chance the automaker could file for bankruptcy by  June. The embattled U.S. car companies are also set to release March sales  figures, starting about midday and they are expected to fall to 40-year lows.  GM option volume ran at above normal levels with about 35,000 puts and 25,000  calls traded. June and April puts at the $1 strike are among the most active  and seems to include a significant amount of premium selling --84 percent of  the Junes are hitting bid-side -- perhaps on the view that shares will hold  above $1 in the near-term, said WhatsTrading.com option strategist Frederic  Ruffy.

'The emphasis of virtually every conversation we had with the merchants we  surveyed was the economy, not fashion. This new mind-set may pose a risk to the  industry as it could result in less innovation, less novelty and ultimately  less compelling product,' the firm wrote, adding that new styles 'have  historically been the catalysts to entice customers back to paying full price  for apparel.'  Merrill added that most of the merchants it spoke to expect markdowns to  continue in the spring and summer.  'Many retailers were not expecting the severity of the economic  deterioration in late 2008, and inventory has not yet been sufficiently cut,'  it wrote. 'Several survey respondents felt that by fall of 2009, inventory will  largely be aligned with demand, which is a view that we agree with.'
