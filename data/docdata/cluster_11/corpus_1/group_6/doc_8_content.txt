This filtered scan is based on the International Securities Exchange (ISE) buy-to-open data. It looks for stocks where the previous day's call volume on the ISE is at least twice as great as the put volume. It then sorts the stocks based on the call volume. Since this is buy-to-open data, this can be a good source for finding stocks where optimism is emerging. Of particular interest to me would be situations where we see call activity on stocks that are still in intermediate-term downtrends.  This would be a potentially cautionary sign from the contrarian perspective  As noted last night, financial stocks were strong Wednesday amid hopes of a bad bank plan. Stocks such as Hartford Financial Services (HIG), Ambac Financial Group Inc (ABK), and Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) were up sharply and this caught the attention of call buyers. Meanwhile, one of the more curious situations may be Akamai Technologies (AKAM). The call buying came amid talk that the company was losing business to Limelight Networks (LLNW).  Other companies seeing a skew towards calls in the previous session: Bank of America (BAC), J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM), SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), Motorola (MOT), Pfizer (PFE), Caterpillar (CAT), American Express (AXP), General Motors Corp (GM), The Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK), Geron Corp. (GERN), DryShips Inc. (DRYS), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), Health Net (HNT), U.S. Bancorp (USB), Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK), Amgen Inc (AMGN), United States Steel Corp (X), EarthLink (ELNK), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), AMR Corp. (AMR), Goldcorp Incorporated (GG)  -posted by Nick Perry on 1/29/2009 9:11 AM  Discuss this post (Comments: 0)    Email to a Friend   Email Nick Perry about this post
