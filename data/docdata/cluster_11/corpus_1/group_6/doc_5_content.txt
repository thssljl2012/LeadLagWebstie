It looks for stocks where the previous day's call volume on the ISE is at least twice as great as the put volume. It then sorts the stocks based on the call volume. Since this is buy-to-open data, this can be a good source for finding stocks where optimism is emerging. Of particular interest to me would be situations where we see call activity on stocks that are still in intermediate-term downtrends. This would be a potentially cautionary sign from the contrarian perspective   As has tended to be the case recently, we find some of the beaten-up financial names seeing call accumulations. Citigroup Inc (C), Bank of America (BAC), Genworth Financial Inc (GNW), and CIT Group Inc (CIT) have all lost more than 50% in the last year but call buyers seem to be betting on a bounce.   Other companies seeing a skew towards calls in the previous session: Suncor Energy (SU), IBM (IBM), ChevronTexaco (CVX), Fluor Corp. (FLR), General Motors Corp (GM), Yahoo! (YHOO), Intel Corp. (INTC), MEMC Electronic Materials (WFR), Schlumberger N.V. (SLB), CIENA Corp. (CIEN), Nokia Corp. (NOK), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL), Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR), Annaly Mortgage Management (NLY), AMR Corp. (AMR), Seagate Technology (STX), Wyeth (WYE), First Solar, Inc. (FSLR), Cisco Systems (CSCO), MasterCard Incorporated (MA).  Search Past Blog Entries
