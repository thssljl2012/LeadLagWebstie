The bounce is probably prompted today on the Bank of America rise of 20% yesterday, though not related, its positive for the world banking sector. Dow futures look promising as well, so we are in for a good morning at least.   Anyway, got some this morn at 60 and will sell at 70, no messing, tidy profit, and not hanging about.
