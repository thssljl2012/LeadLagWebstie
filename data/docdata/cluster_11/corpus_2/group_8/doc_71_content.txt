   Tuesday November 25 ACM Asian  Market Brief         The   Usd   was weaker in the Asian session, as risk appetite increased on the back of US initiatives.  Wall Street's strong rally  (lead by financials) carried over into Asia, as heavy risk buying is now driving down safe haven fx trades (Jpy, Chf, Usd). Yesterday's decision by the US Treasury, Fed and FDIC to support  Citibank .. and the growing prospect of a second and more sizable fiscal stimulus being launched near term. was unmistakably being embraced by investors. In addition,  President-elect Obama  named his economic team, with NY Fed President Geithner as Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers will lead the National Economic Council and Christina Romer will run the Council of Economic Advisers, appointments which also has the markets support. Given the recent price action across asset classes, we see a positive trend in risk sentiment and traders should adjust strategies accordingly.       The   EurUsd   traded to a high of 1.2959, while   UsdJpy   climbed to 97.43.  Carry Trades  initially rallied but failed to hold their positive momentum, as AudJpy traded up to 63.72 and then dropped to 61.51.        Asian regional indexes  are broadly higher, with the  Nikkei  up 5.22%, but European stock futures are pointing to a mixed open. Commodities are down slightly from yesterday's strong rally, with  crude wti  trading at $53.27bll and   spot gold   $812.60oz. FX trading will be dominated by evolving global initiatives, which has been driving risk sentiment.      In European trading, markets we'll be watching out for the detailed release of  German GDP (q3) . While q2 was partly weather related, we expect today's report (contraction of 0.5%) to be driven completely by deteriorating fundamentals. However, with   Euro   trading on more macro factors we don't expect this realization to have a significant effect of recent momentum.
