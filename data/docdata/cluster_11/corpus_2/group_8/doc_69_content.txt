They say we could see an explosion to the upside                         after a meeting scheduled for March 12th.                           On that date, a House financial services subcommittee plans a                         hearing on mark-to-market accounting rules, which have been blamed                         for forcing banks to report billions of dollars in write-downs.                           Karen Finerman has long been an advocate of putting these rules                         on hiatus for a while and letting the banks breathe.                                                       If that meeting results in the government relaxing                         mark-to-market rules, optionMonster Jon Najarian thinks the stock                         market could explode.     On                         Wednesday he told us    , if the government                         relaxes mark-to-market for 12 to 18 months you could see financials                         move 100% in a matter of hours.                           And he went on to say, In fact, I hope youll replay the                         soundbite because if the government relaxes mark-to-market                         accounting a number of banks stocks will be unbelievable values at                         these levels.                           Consider the soundbite replayed.

Mark-to-market accounting requires assets to be valued at                         current market prices. Some banks say it forces them to mark down                         assets to artificially low prices in the current financial crisis,                         even when banks intend to hold the assets past the current                         reporting period.

Wow thanks for the tip... will study if there is                         anything to it... but of course, they might not change the marked                         to market rules... and decide that it is better to just PRINT MORE                         MONEY.
