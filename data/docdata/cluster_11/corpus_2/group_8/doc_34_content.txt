" Moody's Investor Service changed its rating outlook on  JPMorgan Chase  (JPM) to negative from stable. Moody's indicated the change stemmed from expectations that JPMorgan will continue to incur high provisions and credit costs. JPM is trading 4.2% lower at $18.50 per share in premarket trade. Moody's also announced it has put  Wells Fargo  (WFC) on review for possible downgrade. WFC is trading 7.9% lower at $8.90 per share ahead of the opening bell. Moody's announced this morning that the ratings of  Bank of America  (BAC) are on review for possible downgrade. The review was prompted by concern the bank's capital ratios could deteriorate. The news has pushed BAC 4.7% lower to $3.42 per share in premarket action. Capital concerns took a toll on shares of  General Electric  (GE) Wednesday. However, this morning in a CNBC interview the company's CFO stated there is no need to put capital into the company's capital arm and that speculation about GE's capital risk is overdone. The company expects to be profitable this year. GE is trading 1.6% lower at $6.58 per share in premarket action."         thread start
