   Stock index futures pointed to a weak open Friday with banks set to take a hammering on growing fears of nationalization for   Citigroup   and   Bank of America  .       Shares of the two Wall Street giants both fell in pre-market action as traders and analysts speculated about a coming wave of government ownership in the financial sector. Citigroup was nearly 7 percent lower and Bank of America was nearly 6 percent lower ahead of the open.       This comes after as selloff Thursday that saw the Dow crash through the November low to settle at a six-year low.      Traders have been clamoring for details of the Obama administration's stimulus plans, which were expected to assuage market jitters. But when specific plans for the mortgage-rescue plan emerged, stocks sold off.      "This market sold off quite frankly because it did not like the plan period," Jack Bouroudjian, a principal at Brewer Investment Group, told CNBC.      And, while tech stocks had a harder selloff than financials yesterday, Bouroudjian said it all comes down to the banks.      "The banking sector is the heart blood of capitalism. Unless it gets healthy, the rest of the sectors are going to spin their wheels," he said.      Futures pared their losses somewhat after an inflation gauge came in as expected.    Consumer prices rose 0.3 percent    last month, the first gain since July; core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent.      Switzerlands tax and banking laws came under sharp scrutiny as US authorities widened a probe into  UBS  by suing for details of 52,000 of its clients.       The Swiss bank agreed to large fines earlier in the week in an attempt to settle criminal charges. UBS shares fell 14 percent premarket.      Bank of America is also under legal scrutiny, as chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lewis was subpoenaed by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo last week. Cuomo is investigating whether the bank violated state law by withholding information from investors, a source familiar with the case told CNBC.       "Would I be buying the equity in Citi and Bank of America here? I mean, it's very cheap, but I think the banks survive; I don't think the equity survives," Steve Auth, CIO of global equities at Federated Investors, told CNBC.Tough times continued for the auto sector as   General Motors'   loss-making unit  Saab said it would seek legal protection from creditors  as it scrambles to restructure and gather new funding.       And  missing Texas billionaire Allen Stanford has been found  in Fredericksburg, Virginia and served with a complaint accusing him of an $8 billion fraud.
