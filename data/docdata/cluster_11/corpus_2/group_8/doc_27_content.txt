                               I understand what your are saying.   Several Months ago, I looked at a bunch of stocks... examined the charts and decided to go bottom fishing.  I put in limit orders on 6 to 8 stocks at 3 to $5 less than they were selling for... figured on a bad day just might get one of them.  Well... i hooked Bank of America at 9... it kept falling.  Decided this was a flawed strategy and stayed away since.  PP
