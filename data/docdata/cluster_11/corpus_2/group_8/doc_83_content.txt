      Financial stocks suffered more losses Thursday after Moody's Investors Service said concerns about capital levels may lead it to downgrade the ratings of Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. The ratings agency also lowered the outlook on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s ratings to negative.    Bank of America shares dropped 23 cents, or 6.4 percent, to $3.36; Wells Fargo plunged $1.35, or 14 percent, to $8.31; JPMorgan shed $1.16, or 6 percent, to $18.13. Shares of Citigroup Inc., once the nation's most powerful bank, fell below $1 a share. Citi has lost more than 85 percent of its value so far this year, and is down more than 95 percent from a year ago as the bank was pummeled by the financial market crisis.    Citigroup's shares will remain on the New York Stock Exchange. Last week, the NYSE relaxed its listing rules to allow stocks that fall under $1 to still be listed and traded on the exchange.    Government bond prices rose. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, fell to 2.89 percent from 2.98 percent late Wednesday. The yield on the three-month T-bill, considered one of the safest investments, slipped to 0.23 percent from 0.25 percent Wednesday.    Gold prices advanced, even as the dollar rose against other major currencies.    Light, sweet crude fell 88 cents to $44.50 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.    Markets overseas were mostly lower. In afternoon trading, Britain's FTSE 100 fell 2.29 percent, Germany's DAX index fell 2.87 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 2.49 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.95 percent after Wall Street's Wednesday rally, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.97 percent.           2009 The Associated Press.
