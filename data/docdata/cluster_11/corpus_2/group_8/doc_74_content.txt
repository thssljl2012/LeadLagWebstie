  Citigroup  is not having conversations with the U.S. government about nationalization, two people close to the bank said Friday. The U.S. Treasury has not disclosed much more to Citigroup than it has to the broader public about its plans for the banking sector, the people said.            Rumors of nationalization hammered U.S. bank shares on Friday, with Citigroup among the hardest hit -- its shares fell Friday morning and traded as low as $1.94.     cnbc_comboQuoteMove('popup_C_ID0EQAAC15839609');
