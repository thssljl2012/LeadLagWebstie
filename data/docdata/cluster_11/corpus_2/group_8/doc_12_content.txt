      Montana:      Looks like some of the stimulus or TARP money is going to go to more insurance companies, I always wondered why AIG was the only one while the others sank lower and lower.       So watch LNC, HIG, GNW...those were mentioned. Is CIT in that group as well. Might be worth buying on Monday.       Thanks Montana for the information. Besides the rally and the relationship to financials, I was wondering why HIG took such a turn for me on Friday.
