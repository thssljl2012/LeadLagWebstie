 GE Message Board Posts          Recs: 0              Waaaaaay....Waaaaaaaaay Oversold.....    Deutsche Bank-North America analyst Nigel Coe on Thursday said the stock was oversold, in part because GE's industrial segment alone is worth about $12 per share.    Also Thursday, Barclay's analyst Jonathan Glionna upgraded GE Capital's debt to "Market Weight" from "Underweight," primarily because of "the decline in bond prices, which has made valuation significantly more attractive."    If the lower prices for GE Capital bonds attract fresh investments, the segment's need for additional funds from its parent company will be reduced, potentially boosting GE's earnings prospects. In addition, a business's borrowing costs typically decline as debt ratings rise.
