            Quote:   What do you think about GE at the current levels spider?          It's buying time for GE.  I just wish I had more cash to pump into it now.  It's a terrific buy, in my opinion.  I bought some GE between 11 and 12.  I think it was a great bargain at that price.  Now the PE is 4.75.  Dang!    So many bargains.  So little cash.  I might sell some Google and put that money into GE.      GE stock      spider
