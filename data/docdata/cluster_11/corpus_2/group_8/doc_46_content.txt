The absolute cheapest way to buy silver, however, is to buy it while it is still in the ground. You can do that by purchasing shares in companies that mine silver. One of these is Hecla Mining (HL). Hecla will be particularly attractive to value investors. The share price is currently very depressed in comparison to the potential of the company. Long time investors have waited a very long time, and have had their hopes burned away, multiple times. Such investors are exhausted at the cusp of the stock rising, and now just want to be rid of their stock. That is a perfect time to buy a company with a bright future.    Hecla will finally start capitalizing on all its hefty investments. Hecla is a long term bet, but huge gains may be in store for patient stockholders. As a result of buying a large new mine in Alaska, the company increased silver production by 54%, and increased its reserves to 325 million ounces. Little known is the fact that the new mine is also VERY rich in gold. Hecla will mine between 55-60,000 troy ounces of gold, as well as up to 11 million ounces of silver this year. It will also produce tons and tons of lead and zinc, but prices for those metals are unlikely to rise until after the depression is over, which may be a long time from now. Accordingly, the value of its lead and zinc production is unlikely to add much to Heclas profits.    Unlike some other mining companies, Heclas mines are now located exclusively in North America and Mexico, rather than politically unstable countries like Venezuela. Large losses were incurred, as a result of the past closure of Heclas gold mining operations inside Hugo Chavezs Venezuela, and that is part of why investors are exhausted. But, that is ancient history now. The company still has $30 million in cash, locked up in that country, however, waiting to be repatriated.    It bears mentioning that Bank of Americas analysts recently downgraded the company from neutral to underperform. ..."       http://seekingalpha.com/article/124517-silver-backwardation-prices-about-to-soar?source=email     best wishes, Bull
