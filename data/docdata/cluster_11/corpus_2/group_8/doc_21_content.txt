 All the world's stock markets in the red.     Bank of America, AIG, and HSBC laying in the background like time bombs.     Only GREEN is Precious Metals.     U.S Market Futures looking very bad for the U. S. market open.     The Japanese trashing their own fiat currency to try to gain an export advantage.     The rest of the world's fiat currencies behaving like a plate full of Mexican jumping beans.     I've seen bad Mondays but this looks very bad.
