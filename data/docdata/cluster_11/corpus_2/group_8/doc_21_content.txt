 If you followed my comments for the pastseveral months you will see thatmy predictions for DOW, TSX, and gold have beennearly realized. That is, 6000 DOW, 7500 TSX and 1050 Gold. With regards to stimulus injection, absolutely agree with you that poorly managed companies must go to zero or get taken out by prudently managed companies. My belief is that the USA and Canadian governments are fully aware of which companies will ultimately go to zero, i.e. AIG, Bank of America, Citibank, (HSBC is questionable), andGM, to name a few. As the air is gradually beingreleased from this convoluted bubble, governments inject funds at various intervals during the inevitabledropto buffer the "panic", otherwise, we could see a massive suicide event where investors and money managers begin jumping from their balconies. The stimulus injection provides a time buffer for investors to unwind their positions in the companies that are likely moving off the map.  Mudslide
