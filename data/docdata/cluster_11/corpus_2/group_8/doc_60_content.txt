LOVE to see our Bank of America (symbol "BAC"), Citibank (symbol "C") and General Electric (symbol "GE") all are rebounding, climbing up again on Wall Street's trading board.  BA be a conservative bank, BA's Columbia Cash Reserves can generate capital much better than to do the Socialist and his fans a favor but returned bad loans, bad credits.
