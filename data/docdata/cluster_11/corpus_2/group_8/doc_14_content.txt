            quote:   Originally posted by Chicken George      We'll get to zero eventually. I was hoping by election day last year but they stopped dropping by 500 points a day for some reason.           Because those 500 points were mostly in bank,  insurance, and auto stocks. AiG went to near zero and was pulled out of the DJIA, and C and BAC fell hard.      GE, AXP, and (I think) JPM are on their way down, so we'll see more damage.
