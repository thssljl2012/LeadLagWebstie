          Sears And Low Bucks     If it weren't for the two Sandras, we'd never know what really goes on every three months.                       Quote:              Analysts wondered aloud Thursday about Kmart's survival and the number of Sears stores that will close in the wake of Sears Holdings Corp.'s report of a bigger-than-expected first-quarter loss and sales declines.                         Quote:              "Kmart is not relevant at all," said Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz &amp; Associates Inc., a national retail consulting and investment banking firm.        Davidowitz said Sears Chairman Edward S. Lampert should shutter the Kmart chain and close Sears stores that are losing money.        Kmart's leases, many for 99 years and at $1 a square foot, are "tremendously valuable," Davidowitz said.                         Quote:              Analysts also were puzzled by Sears' unusual pronouncement that its profits after expenses, called EBITDA, should be higher this fiscal year than last.        Analyst Gary Balter of Credit Suisse said it would be difficult to figure that out unless Sears sells assets or liquidates the company.                              Quote:              He said Lampert, a billionaire hedge-fund manager, could be trying to keep vendors happy, prevent other hedge-fund investors from bailing, or assure rating agencies after Bank of America refused to renew a $1 billion long-term credit agreement with Sears under existing terms.            I thought SHC said that was "inconsequential" or some such.    And of course the usual fish lips routine:                 Quote:              Of Lampert, Davidowitz said, "Here's a very wealthy man . . . who is  smarter than smart . Does he really want to stay in the middle of this?"            Smarter than smart, eh?  Someone who was smarter than smart would a) have never gotten himself into this mess to start with or b) recognized that even being smarter than smart, he wasn't as smart as he thought he was about retail and hired someone who was and let THEM run the company.        He can't even get a real CEO to come to work for him now.
