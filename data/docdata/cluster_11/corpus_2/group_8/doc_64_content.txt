Does anyone else think you could buy $10k worth of these puppies and sell them say at 20% profit during the day or even over a period of weeks if you had to - they're selling for pennies.                      Yeah, 30% to even 50% daily fluctuations are normal for some of these stocks in this market....  And please remember that anything that can go up 30% to 50% can also fall down 30% to 50%....    But yeah, that's why I've mentioned elsewhere that you don't need to over-trade to chase after large gains (and losses).  In fact, with volatility like this, you only need One Good Trade....  That's why I emphasize quality trades versus quantity.
