It is true that there is plenty of bad news still, but there are some signs that we may be at (or near) the bottom.    1) Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America all announced they turned a profit the first 2 months of the year - since the problems with the big banks are what lead to the big market crash in October this is an indication that the bailout money has had a significant affect - a good sign.    2) Retail sale in February - while still down - were better than analysts had anticipated - possibly a sign we are approaching the bottom - and despite you comment about Wall Street treating bad news as good news, there is NOTHING NEW in Wall Street doing that. It OFTEN does that, responding poorly if good news is not as good as expected or responding positively if bad news is not as bad as expected.    3) GM announced it wouldn't need the latest installment of bailout money - again, a sign that perhaps they have gotten their themselves back on track    4) There are some good indications that the credit freeze is thawing and that money is beginning to flow again - again, a good sign.    These are all positive changes, so there IS some good news out there. Is it still outweighed by the bad? Of course it is, but any recovery will start that way - with a few indicators turning upward while the bulk are still downward, so PERHAPS these are signs that we are near (or at) the bottom - hence the big rally on Wall Street this week.
