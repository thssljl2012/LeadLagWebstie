                Quote:                          U.S. stocks rallied, extending yesterdays 6.4 percent surge in the Standard &amp; Poors 500 Index, as speculation grew the worst of the banking crisis may be over. Shares in Europe and Asia also advanced.             Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. jumped more than 9.2 percent after Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the government will use capital injections to spur lenders to sell distressed securities.                     "speculation".  That's a very dangerous thing to do based on ONE piece of information that may not even be true.  If there is this "speculation" back out there, there is going to be a serious problem with rosy glasses people-- who will invest and throw money at prospects that are losers.      In addition, Geithner says the govt will use 'capital injections to spur lenders to sell distressed securities"     what a dumb statement.    selling a toxic asset means the company takes a Loss.  = bad  buying a toxic asset means it may not be worth what you pay = bad  getting 'capital injections' is taking out a loan, in a deflationary cycle =bad    What the hell is Geithner thinking?  the ONLY way to clear toxic assets is to let failures fail.  Then these assets bottom and a REAL NUMBER can be assigned to their value by the bankruptcy manager.        link here for story
