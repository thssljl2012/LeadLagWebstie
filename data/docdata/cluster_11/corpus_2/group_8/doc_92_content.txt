On Wall Street, the US Dow Jones index fell below 7,000 points for the first time since October 1997.   In the UK, the FTSE 100 index briefly hit a six-year low. Markets elsewhere in Europe also fell sharply.   Confidence was hit by a fresh $30bn bail-out of US insurance giant AIG following a record $62bn loss, and by HSBC's plans to raise 12.5bn.
