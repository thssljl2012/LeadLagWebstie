Personally, I think it would be unwise to replace 'for the sake of the economy go ye forth and consume!' with 'for the sake of the economy go ye forth and surf and view advertising!'  For one thing, linking advertising revenue directly to the perceived 'results' metric might lead to curious feedback loops in the economy.  We already have those with billboards, Clear Channel, and politicians.     http://gigaom.com/2009/03/10/should-...ed-to-the-dow/        Quote:                         A provocative story from  Reuters  Monday ruminated on which companies are likely to replace Citigroup and General Motors in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Its conclusion:  Google and Cisco  are the most likely contenders, with  Apple and Visa  having a less likely chance.    It&#8217;s a safe bet that those two troubled companies &#8212; trading below $2 a share &#8212; will get the boot, potentially along with Bank of America, which is trading below $4. All are plagued by concerns that bankruptcies or government takeovers would wipe out shareholders. Talk of a reshuffling of the Dow has been heating up of late.  ...                     Visa??? that should just about sink 'Dow Theory' forever.
