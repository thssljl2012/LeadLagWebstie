Technical chart analysts warn that the breakdown below the 2002-2003 support levels sounds an extremely loud alarm, paints a large billboard warning, and should be taken seriously as a dire development. Novices might not recognize the pattern below in the S&amp;P500 index, but experienced analysts surely do. It is a long-term DoubleTop Head &amp; Shoulders reversal pattern. It is a Mother of Reversal Patterns. Its base is roughly at 775, its top at 1550, which indicates a target of nearly zero. Not only are private wealth accounts being cut down but pension funds as well. Individuals invest much more in stocks than pension funds, which are diversified into bonds and commercial property. All asset groups are suffering. The public has begun to respond in minor panic to the stock market declines, as private telephone calls testify. Expect another decline of 25% to 35% on both the S&amp;P index and Dow Jones Industrial Index. With each passing month comes more specific evidence of economic deterioration or disintegration, coupled with mammoth additional bank losses. They push stocks down. The key drivers seem to be job loss and big financial firm loss. See the history making $100 billion AIG annual loss, the ongoing hemorrhage at Citigroup and Bank of America, the gigantic extensions of cash from the USGovt to big banks.         The claptrap propaganda coming from Wall Street centers on price multiples against earnings. The problem is that earnings are evaporating, and the PE ratio argument is empty. The response in the gold &amp; silver prices to the deep stock declines, cratered pensions, and loss of life savings will be profound, with advances to date only a prelude to a march to $2000 gold and $50 silver.                   thread start
