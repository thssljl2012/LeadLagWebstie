We, in America, know their street-level strengths and weaknesses. What do you know about them on a practical, ground level way?  I am wondering why you would not invest in a Finnish company which you might know far better than one far across the ocean?  In my opinion, investment like this is something which will get the investor into trouble.                      This boils down to the ages old 'fundamental analysis' vs. 'technical analysis'-discussion. If your style happens to be technical analysis, from purely theoretical POV you don't need further information about the company you are trading. In fact, you don't trade companies, you trade charts. The market price includes everything you need.    Even if you'd visit B of A branch every day, even if you worked there, the information you gained might be worthless, even bring you losses. Why? Because B of A isn't America: so many pieces of the puzzle remain beyond their power. For example, the decision whether to nationalize or not, isn't something decided by the board of Bank of America. And, like everywhere, two people might see the same information, and come to exactly opposite conclusions.    My investment style is basically technical analysis. In this particular case I can't claim the BAC chart would look good. It doesn't. My decision to buy a small lot of BAC was based on what has happened elsewhere in a bit similar situation (Sweden, Finland, Norway in the early '90s) plus the overall very negative sentiment, which tends to precede a rally. In this case BAC rallied 30% from where I bought it, but is now back where it started. Anyway, from the very beginning I regard this position very option-like: either I will lose 'the premium' or the return will be very good. My time horizon here is months, not days. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets worse before it gets better.    However, I do agree with your basic point: outsiders tend to get screwed.
