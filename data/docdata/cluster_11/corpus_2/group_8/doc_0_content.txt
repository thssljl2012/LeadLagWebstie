      Quote:                         NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- U.S. stocks tumbled to fresh, less-than-welcome milestones on Monday after insurance giant American International Group Inc.  ( AIG: +7.75% ) reported a  massive $61.7 billion loss.                      what is it with these people? last week RBS reported the biggest loss ever in UK company history, and its stock rose 25%. today, AIG loses 60 billion bucks and its share price increases 8%. now granted it's only a 3 cent increase as AIG is now worth the princely sum of 42 cents a stock, but still, this is just insane.
