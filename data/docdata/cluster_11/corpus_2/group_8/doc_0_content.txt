          I bought 250 shares of Nortel Networks, when it was around $3.50 a share. It is now hanging by a thread. Is there a chance it could rebound. I also have around 250-350 shares of Ford, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Bank of America. I contribute maximum on Traditional IRA for me and non-working spouse to Hartford mutual funds, and i am in a non classified mutual fund with Growth funds of america $1000.00 a month. I am 36, and started my contributions just a little over a year ago. Do you have any suggestions for me.  Thanks Brent
