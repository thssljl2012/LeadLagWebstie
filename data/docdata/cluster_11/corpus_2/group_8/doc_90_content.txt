 It's crazy to blame short selling on the market crash or a particular company's failure.  If short sellers were artificially suppressing prices, "speculators" would push prices the opposite direction (remember, when prices are going up, "speculators" are blamed for irrationally high prices).        Speculators and short sellers do not have the ability, at least on any issue that's widely traded, to create artificially high prices or to destroy otherwise sound companies.  What is the correct price of an asset?  The price at which those in the market are willing to buy and sell it.          If we want to ban short selling, why not just get it over with and legislate a particular stock price for companies (e.g. no selling citibank for less than $2).
