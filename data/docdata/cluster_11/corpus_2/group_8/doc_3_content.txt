 Shares of Greif Inc. jumped Thursday as strong results from the packaging maker's North American operations helped lift its fiscal first-quarter profit beyond analyst expectations.      For the three months ended Jan. 31, net income slid to $1.3 million, or 3 cents per Class A share, from $60.7 million, or $1.03 per Class A share, in the year-earlier period, the Delaware, Ohio, company said.      Excluding one-time items, income was $21.7 million, or 38 cents per Class A share, compared with $68.6 million, or $1.16 per Class A share, in the year-earlier period.      Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected, on average, 35 cents per share. The estimates typically exclude nonrecurring items.      Sales declined to $666.3 million from $846.3 million. Analysts expected $711.4 million.      KeyBanc analyst Christopher D. Manuel, who reiterated his "Buy" rating on the stock and $40 price target, said Greif's North American industrial packaging operations were particularly strong.      He said operating income for the company's North American industrial packaging and service segment tripled to almost $30 million.      Manuel wrote that while no details were given in the release regarding the outperformance in North America, it could be explained by headcount reduction, lower interest cost accruals and such efficiency initiatives as less discretionary spending, capacity reductions and limits on hiring and salary increases.      Deutsche Bank-North America analyst Christopher Chun, who has a $55 price target, said it was "encouraging" Greif reaffirmed its per-Class A share profit guidance for fiscal 2009 in a range of $3.25 to $3.75. Analysts generally expect $3.35.      Shares rose $3.33, or 12 percent, to $31.56 in midday trading.
