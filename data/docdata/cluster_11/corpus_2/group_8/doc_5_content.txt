...So many shares...10 bucks a piece or 5...GM, FORD, GE, Citibank, Bank of America Good stocks too.........Why not invest some money in them? ..Even if they all go bankrupt you could perhaps hold on to these stocks and common shares and trade them for shares of a new company; wait for a restructuring of that new company, and just maybe...you can become rich..Thanks to the good people of ATS. I think this makes sense lol...
