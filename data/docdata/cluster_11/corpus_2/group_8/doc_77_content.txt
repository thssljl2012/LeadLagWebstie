First, I went back and rechecked my memory for the histrocal high on the Dow.  I was off about 1,000 points. Actual high was 14,164.53.  One quarter of that would be 3,541.13.  Last time the Dow finished lower than that was July 22, 1993.  On July 23, 1993 the Dow finished at 3,546.74.   *******     Interesting that a Citibank ATM charges more for a transaction than a Citigroup share is worth.     ************   Someone in my office knows two people who converted their entire 401K balances to money market fund back last August.  I am seriously jealous of those folks.     *****   Until last Friday, my roll-over IRA was still worth more than it was back in May 1998 when I rolled it over from an old 401K.  The May 1998 Dow was 2,000 points better than the 1997 Dow, so I was doing pretty well. But Friday and Monday killed that thought.     At some point there will come a great buying opportunity, but who knows when.
