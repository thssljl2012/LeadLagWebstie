 What am I missing? I saw NO NUMBERS anywhere indicating anything to be positive about. It is just some blather by Pandit saying his "numbers were better".    What numbers?! He makes some vague statement of being profitable but does not say by how much.                                                   Pandit Says Citigroup Having Best Quarter Since 2007 (Update1)                                 By Edward Evans                                                                                                                                                                                     March 10 (Bloomberg) --  Citigroup Inc.  Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit   said his bank is having the best quarter since 2007 , when it last posted a profit.                                                                 I am most encouraged with the strength of our business so far in 2009, Pandit wrote in an internal memorandum obtained today by Bloomberg. In fact,  we are profitable through the first two months of 2009  and are having our best quarter-to-date performance since the third quarter of 2007. The bank had $19 billion of revenue in January and February before disclosed writedowns, he added.                 Citigroup has  logged five quarters  of losses totaling more than $37.5 billion since it posted a $2.1 billion profit in the third quarter of 2007. Once the worlds biggest bank by market value, it fell below $1 in New York trading last week for the first time as investors lost confidence that the shares can recover after losses and a government rescue.                 I am, like you, disappointed with our current stock price and the broad-based misperceptions about our company and its financial position, Pandit wrote. The price doesnt reflect the banks capital strength and earnings potential, he added.                  The New York-based  bank traded at $1.20 in Germany today, 14 percent higher than yesterdays New York closing price. The stock has tumbled 95 percent in the past year, cutting the banks market value to about $5.8 billion, less than Japans Nomura Holdings Inc. and Turkeys  Akbank TAS , in which Citigroup owns a 20 percent stake. The bank is the smallest company and the worst- performing stock in the 30-member  Dow Jones Industrial Average .                 Government Stake                 The governments plan to exchange its preferred stock for common shares will make Citigroup the strongest U.S. bank measured on tangible common equity, Pandit added. The transaction will also make the government Citigroups biggest shareholder, with a 36 percent stake.                 The U.S. government is examining ways to further stabilize Citigroup if needed, the Wall Street Journal reported today, citing people it didnt identify. Federal officials called the steps contingency planning and arent expecting a sudden turn for the worse, the Journal said.                 Citigroups deposits are relatively stable, Pandit said in his memo to employees. The bank has also conducted its own stress tests, using assumptions more pessimistic that the Federal Reserves, he added. Citigroup is confident about its capital strength. Expenses totaled $8.1 billion in the year through February, less than Citigroups target, Pandit said.                 The bank was created by the 1998 combination of Citicorp and Travelers Group Inc., which with a value of $85 billion was the largest merger in history at the time. The transaction helped persuade the U.S. government to repeal a Great Depression-era law, the Glass-Steagall Act, that prohibited banks that took consumer deposits from engaging in investment-banking activities.
