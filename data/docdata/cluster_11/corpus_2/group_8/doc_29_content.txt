       The nationalization trade is still working  The near nationalization of Citibank has produced the result we predicted, namely that the shorts would move on to target other financials and industrials with substantial finance operations.  GE, rare possessor of a AAA rating, is now trading at $6.50 or so, even though it says its capital is fine.   The objectives of the shorts include taking the stock below $5, where many institutions will be forced to sell, and to use a vicious, self-reinforcing and simple strategy to wipe out the companys AAA rating and take the company down to zero if possible. The US government has already demonstrated that when that happens it will rescue the institution in a manner that will more-or-less wipe out the shareholders. The shorts can then move on to the next target, and so on.   In our view  the traders looking to profit on such a strategy likely not only include your typical hedge fund low-lifes, but also enemies of the US (Russian mafia? Irans bankers?). Tim Geithner should step down. Weve never seen such incompetence (or worse?) on such a grand scale displayed in such a short time.    http://www.dinocrat.com/archives/2009/03/04/the-nationalization-trade-is-still-working/    Who'd think that a company like GE could be targeted for destruction?  I wouldn't be surprised if Soros, operating from offshore, isn't among the manipulators here.    There are only six companies left with "AAA" ratings from both S&amp;P and Moodys. The are Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Berkshire Hathaway (BRK), GE (GE), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Exxon (XOM), and Toyota (TM).  http://247wallst.com/2008/04/08/the-aaa-club-wh/    Past time to bring back the uptick rule as well as throw out mark to market:   http://siliconinvestor.advfn.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25455522
