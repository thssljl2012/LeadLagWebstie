Just a blurb from Schwab [ mainly about preffereds]. http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/research_strategies/market_insight/investing_strategies/bonds/preferred_stock_nationalization_and_the_banking_sector.html Bank of America (Baa1/A-) Bank of America appears to have taken federal funds primarily to help with the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, whose losses have been greater than expected. Discussions have been less aggressive about the possibility of nationalization. Many analysts have recently viewed Bank of Americas revenue outlook as a bit stronger than Citigroupas evidenced by the still-stronger preferred stock ratingsunless Merrill-related losses continue to be worse than expected. Management has also said its not currently in discussion with the government about additional funds or an additional government ownership stake. Conditions, of course, can change. For any firm, including Bank of America, weakening earnings would continue to be a concern. Watch the daily news and the price of common stock sharesas well as available analytical sources, such as Schwab Equity Ratingsfor additional insight on the performance of the company overall.
