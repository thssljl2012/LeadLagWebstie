 Precious Metals Message Board Posts          Recs: 1              B. of A. Merrill Lynch lifts gold, silver forecasts   LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgraded their gold and silver forecasts, lifting their spot gold forecast for 2009 to $1,000 an ounce from $875, the 2010 gold forecast to $1,050 an ounce from $900, the 2009 silver forecast to $14.50 an ounce from $11 and the 2010 silver forecast to $15 from $11. "We believe the outlook for precious metals is much more promising. Increasing inflation expectations, a shift toward liquid assets, a rapid increase in credit risk, falling stock markets, and a wave of monetary and fiscal policies are contributing to fuel a rally in gold prices," the broker said. The broker upgraded Iamgold     to buy from neutral but lowered Hecla Mining  to underperform from neutral.        http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/update-b-merrill-lynch-lifts/story.aspx?guid={DBB7F8A0-F243-44C4-9D1E-A4BD389BE3D1}&amp;dist=msr_10
