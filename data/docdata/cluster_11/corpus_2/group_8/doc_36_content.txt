Liable okay. Why do you think I never invest in many penny stocks? Results in the ling run will be the thing that matters. Have them and investor will do well. Don't have an eps growing and you won't. With dow at 10 year lows all stocks don't look to good. The thing is with penny stocks you know the high risk. What is bad is when stocks like Bank of America have huge losses. You don't expect to lose that big a % in share price with big stocks. I have said when I see SPNG eps not going up qrt over qrt then that would bother me. As long as it is big future.
