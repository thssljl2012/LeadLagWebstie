 Income Investing Message Board Posts          Recs: 2              Re: Preferrerds     Re: Preferrerds  I'm  not an expert this subject, but believe you may have misinterpreted the  problem of dividends in arrears relating to cumulative preferred  stock.  It is true you will owe current taxes on dividends not  received, but should you sell before they are paid, the adjustment to  cost basis helps.  Iow, you will have a larger capital loss or a  smaller capital gain.  Maybe I misunderstood the post  More  importantly, the use of preferreds vice common  stock or bonds, seems  complex, since the holder shares a lot of the common share  risk and  much less of the upside potential,  and the risk/reward ratio in  difficult times, favors the holding of debt over both.  Also, corporate  holders of preferreds normally get tax breaks not available to  individuals, unbalancing their distribution/ownership and increasing  volatility in abnormal times.    It is unclear, in the present  circumstance, what troubled banks may do with their preferreds, should  they accept government funds, and the latter elect to trade preferred  for common.  Citi, as I recall, elected in that circumstance to stop  payments on traditional preferreds while continuing payments on those  issued by the capital trusts.  We may be at the point in the  banking crisis where common shares are the better choce for  risk-tolerant investors not focused on current income, and bonds for  the risk-adverse   Iac, the main criterion is quality in selection of  the bank.  Here's the ranking of US banks in the forthcoming Global  Finance List of  "50 Safest Banks 2009:" (Purely FWIW)  " San Francisco-based Wells Fargo is the top-rated U.S. bank at No.  21. European banks now dominate the rankings, with only four U.S. banks  among the listing.       "Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) is followed by   US Bancorp   (NYSE:USB) at No. 26, The   Bank of New York Mellon   (NYSE:BK) at No. 35 and   JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.   (NYSE:JPM) &#8212; which has merged with   Washington Mutual Inc.   &#8212; at No. 47.    "Four German banks were ranked in the Top 10, with state-owned development bank KfW Bankengruppe at No. 1."    That said, I recently bought some common and preferred shares of  the above named banks, as well as exchange traded debt of others. I  believe the REIT sector has a longer recovery problem for those in  trouble, but the recent SEC relaxation allowing shareholders be paid in stock (up to 90%) should help support the preferreds.
