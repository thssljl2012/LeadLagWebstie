Why don't you put all these                         stocks under the microscope then decide whether to buy or not and                         decide which ones to buy. What you will find is that there are so                         many things unknown, unknowable and you are just delusional for                         being so sure about it.                                                                                                                                          U have a point. I have met far too many people thinking that                         stocks n shares are like day to day commodities. 50% off the top =                         50% discount. Therefore buy. IF ONLY things were so simplistic.                           Btw, reminds me of a certain SWF .....
