 Shares of Sanderson Farms Inc. soared on Thursday as the chicken producer reported a fiscal first-quarter loss that beat analyst estimates.      Shares of the Laurel, Miss.-based company rose $3, or nearly 11 percent, to $31.25 in morning trading Thursday.      The company said it lost $6.7 million, or 33 cents a share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31. That compares with earnings of $6.2 million, or 30 cents a share, in the same period last year.      But the results beat analyst estimates. According to Thomson Reuters, analysts predicted the company would lose 37 cents a share.      The 7 percent gain in revenue  reaching $388.9 million  also beat estimates of $368.4 million, according to Thomson.      Deutsche Bank North America analyst Christina McGlone wrote in a note to clients that Sanderson noted steady retail demand and poor foodservice demand.      The meat industry is hurting now due to many factors, including a slump in foodservice demand as consumers cut back on their restaurant spending. Costs for main ingredients like corn are coming off record highs reached in the summer, but they are still higher than they were this time last year. An oversupply of meat on the market is also hurting pricing.      The industry has been pledging to cut production as a way to boost pricing, and McGlone said that's how Sanderson Farms will react because it's unclear when demand will improve.      "Sanderson indicated that it will not return to full production until market conditions improve," she wrote.
