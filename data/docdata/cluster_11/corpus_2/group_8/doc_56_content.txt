I guess those new high interest credit cards will help ESL a lot more than they will help Sears Holdings!                Could the retail genius have stubbed his toe         http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/business/01citi-web.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business&amp;oref=slogin                      Quote:              A longtime banking analyst said late last night that Citigroup may be forced to cut its dividend or sell assets to stave off what she said was a $30 billion capital shortfall, moves that  could pull down its shareholder returns for several years .    The analyst, Meredith A. Whitney of CIBC World Markets, downgraded Citigroups stock to sector underperform, from sector perform, and called for the bank to bring precariously low capital levels more in line with its peers.         We believe the stock will be under significant pressure and could trade in the low $30s, she wrote. That would be as much as a 28 percent decline from yesterdays $41.90 closing price for Citigroup shares.                 Of course with insider info. he could have already sold and  made a tidy profit
