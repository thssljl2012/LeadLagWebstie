They say we could see an explosion to the upside                         after a meeting scheduled for March 12th.                           On that date, a House financial services subcommittee plans a                         hearing on mark-to-market accounting rules, which have been blamed                         for forcing banks to report billions of dollars in write-downs.                           Karen Finerman has long been an advocate of putting these rules                         on hiatus for a while and letting the banks breathe.                                                       If that meeting results in the government relaxing                         mark-to-market rules, optionMonster Jon Najarian thinks the stock                         market could explode.     On                         Wednesday he told us    , if the government                         relaxes mark-to-market for 12 to 18 months you could see financials                         move 100% in a matter of hours.                           And he went on to say, In fact, I hope youll replay the                         soundbite because if the government relaxes mark-to-market                         accounting a number of banks stocks will be unbelievable values at                         these levels.                           Consider the soundbite replayed.

Mark-to-market accounting requires assets to be valued at                         current market prices. Some banks say it forces them to mark down                         assets to artificially low prices in the current financial crisis,                         even when banks intend to hold the assets past the current                         reporting period.                            What's the trade?

That's only delaying the inevitable. When you drop mark to                         market accounting, the banks will only be inflating the values.                         People may be stupid and accept the figures, but the sharks arent                         stupid.                           Sharks are the numerous ponzi schemers still hiding under the                         low tide of the inevitable stock market collapse, short selling now                         to survive waiting for such ponzi methods of                         accounting.                           They would have learnt their lessons by now, and they only want                         to get out alive and not clapped in chains. When the stock                         figures rise, they will sell and get out of the market. When they                         sell, the stock market will collapse again. Madoff's scam                         was $60billion. How many more others who cook their books                         but did not confess as Madoff did, who escape SEC                         investigations?                           The inevitable will come. Best let the stock market be                         destroyed. New ways of obtaining capital will have to be found for                         better honesty. The stock market casino had failed                         humanity through its greed. We this generation must pay                         the price and not let our next and future generations be                         doomed.
