         I don't get it.  That article sounds like pure fear-mongering to me.  Libor is more volatile than some other benchmarks.    And geez, from 1.1% to 1.3% in six weeks is cause for alarm?  Almost a quarter of where it was in December?  A fifth of where it was a year and a half ago?    Here's a chart that might be useful.  http://www.wsjprimerate.us/libor/libor_rates_history-chart-g...    From the WSJ article:  A rally in U.S. Treasury bonds last week reflects another bout of flight-to-quality buying. Junk bonds now yield 19 percentage points more than safe Treasury bonds, up from a 16-point spread in February, according to Merrill Lynch. The spread is still narrower than the 21-percentage-point premium reached last December, but any widening shows investors are becoming more fearful.   Again, it's going up.  Just a little.  But clearly the rug is being pulled from under us again!  Run!     I think the media is partially complicit in the severity of the downturn.   Bad news sells.  And getting a scoop on bad news to come sells even more.    I mean, how do you deduce a trend from this:  At AIG, bonds of the insurance giant's subsidiaries last week traded at prices ranging from 38 cents on the dollar to around 81 cents, from more than 50 cents on the dollar a month ago    [/rant]
