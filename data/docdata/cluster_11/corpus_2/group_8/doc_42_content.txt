Economy Up, But Not Stocks Yet Posted By: Tom Brennan Breathe easy, people. The Dows 179-point gain on Tuesday means we wont suffer through another Great Depression. The markets move well into the positive signaled the formation of a long-awaited floor in the economy, Cramer said. So banish visions of even greater unemployment and soup kitchens from your head. But a floor in the economy doesnt equal a bottom in stocks. Thats the catch. Share prices wont head straight up from here. One important thing needs to happen before stocks start their rebound. Of course, pockets of strength are popping up across the market. Retail sales were better than expected in February. Housing starts also rose that month. Commodities are up. Banks are reporting profits. As a result, companies like Amazon.com [AMZN 71.35 4.37 (+6.52%) ], Freeport-McMoRan [FCX 36.93 -0.33 (-0.89%) ] and Toll Brothers [TOL 17.06 0.95 (+5.9%) ] rallied. And banks like Wells Fargo [MOS 42.26 0.91 (+2.2%) ], Bank of America [BAC 6.27 0.09 (+1.46%) ] and Citigroup [C 2.51 0.18 (+7.73%) ] finally bottomed. Also, the Federal Reserves Term Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, should jumpstart the securitized-loan market, encouraging those banks to lend more. The stimulus is kicking in. Mergers and acquisitions are picking up. And unemployment seems to have leveled off. This good news will most likely continue, Cramer said, as long as President Obama and his administration keep spreading a pro-business message. But  and this is an important but  stocks wont follow the economy until earnings estimates come down. Theyre still way too high. And thats across the board: steels, oils, housing, aluminum, travel, infrastructure, insurance and tech. Look, Illinois Tool Works [ITW 27.32 0.38 (+1.41%) ] cut its estimates yesterday, and today Nucor [NUE 33.55 -3.40 (-9.2%) ] reversed its first-quarter guidance from profits to a loss. U.S. Economy Is Finally Showing Signs of a Recovery Housing Starts Post Surprise Rebound Stocks Barrel Higher as Techs Rally The estimates have to be low enough to beat, Cramer said. The Nasdaqs 2003 bottom happened the same way. So until that happens we might get false bottoms, but no real turn. And we can forget about making a serious move above Dow 8,000.
