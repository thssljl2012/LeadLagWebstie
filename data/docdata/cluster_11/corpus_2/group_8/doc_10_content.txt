         Looks like Eddie-wannabe Julian Day isn't as successful as his former boss when it comes to hacking. From today's Wall Street Journal:                 Quote:              RadioShack Swings to a Profit    Amid Higher Gross Margins    By KEVIN KINGSBURY and KRIS HUDSON    July 31, 2007; Page A11        RadioShack Corp. swung to a second-quarter profit but posted a steep drop in sales, stoking investor fears that the retailer's turnaround strategy could be hobbled.        The electronic retailer's stock slipped $3.25, or 11%, to $25.55 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday despite earnings in line with Wall Street's expectations, as the disappointing sales made investors jittery. RadioShack's sales of $934.8 million were down 15% from a year earlier and were short of the $982.5 million average forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. The retailer's  same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, declined 8.9% in the quarter.     Reeling from stiff competition from larger retailers as well as shifts to less-profitable products in its core wireless business, RadioShack recruited turnaround specialist Julian Day as its chief executive a year ago.  Mr. Day, a veteran of Sears Holdings Corp., has emphasized profit margins over increasing sales, moving to bolster margins by closing stores, laying off workers and slashing spending.  In the first 13 months of Mr. Day's tenure, RadioShack's stock more than doubled to a 52-week high of $34.87 on June 18 before receding this month.        RadioShack, based in Fort Worth, Texas, reported quarterly net income of $47 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $3.2 million, or two cents a share. The second quarter included a $10 million reversal of an income-tax reserve, while the prior-year period included restructuring and lawsuit costs.        For the latest quarter, RadioShack's gross profit margin climbed 3.3 percentage points to 50.5% and its cash balance rose to $630 million from $170 million a year ago.        Bank of America Securities analyst David Strasser expects that RadioShack can buoy its margins for at least another quarter with continued cost cutting. Thereafter, it will need a new product or strategy to spark sales gains. The slide in the retailer's stock price indicates some investors may not have the patience for Mr. Day's strategy to play out.        --Mike Barris contributed to this article.

Glad to see that the training Julian received under Eddie's tutorage is paying off. SSS declines, but harp about profit. Waiting to see what ole Jules will opine, a la Eddie's Fireside Chats and ALLWIND's mumbling ----- possibly that the SSS measurement is not worthwhile at all?
