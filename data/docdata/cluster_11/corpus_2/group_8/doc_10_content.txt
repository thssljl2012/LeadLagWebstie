Slim chance of them going under. down to 3.50 and change, downside risk is very very low. upside is incredible. 5k shares worth most you can lose is 15k, upside is hundreds of thousands, if not millions if it returns to levels down the road.     ABK &amp; MBI. insurance stocks been battered mainly because of AIG news and they have had some problems of their own. Again, downside risk is small. Upside to buying all these stocks I mentioned and holding for 5-10 years is multi-millions and your literally risking 15-20k.     Anyways, just my opinion....                      I've been reading where DRYS was a good buy as well.    Still have to get more experienced in the market before day trading. Thanks for the offer of help though.
