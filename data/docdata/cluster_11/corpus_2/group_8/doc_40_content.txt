 UBS average buying is .70 and selling at .76. Keeping that in mind going into the close. As far as this being like OIL... OIL did not have the deep pockets of NXY at their disposal. Totally different capital here. OPC is not in the middle of the North Sea trying to pump oil and gas out of a reserve with a 70-80 dollar cost per bal. OPC cost for processing is about 30.00 a bal. Add in the cost of companies getting the stuff to them and most of it would still be under 50.00 a bal. Call the company and speak with Sid or Travis. They will fill you in. As far as losing value? Citibank was almost a penny stock yesterday and still may be. Everything is getting hit while the DOW heads into the 5500-6500 level for awhile. As some would say... we ain't seen nutten yet!     Lows and highs for the dow in 1996-1997                                                     JUL 25 1997                            8113.44                                NOV 14 1997              7572.48                                                                                                                                                                      MAY 17 1996                            5687.70                                JUN 3 1996              5478.03                                                                                              1997 did not hold.. 1996 better hold or we will see the 1990 to 1994 level 2400 to 3600 for the DOW. Gee that may be 2012 when we have 2400.00 an oz for Gold .. Finally match up again like they were in the 1970's at 800 and oz and 800 on the Dow. Won't happen? Copy this and check back in 2-3 years.  BTW Oil will keep a ratio to Gold.. always has and always will. 20 to 1 ratio is the average give or take a bit. And uranium will keep pace per lb with the price of a barrel of oil.     Looking like they don't want to go much lower today. I am happy with a few here at .69
