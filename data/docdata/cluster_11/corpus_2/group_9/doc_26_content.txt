WHERE is the Tsunami MARKET Sell-off! {/b] _____________________________________________ Art Cashin: Stock Market Facing 'Significant Pullback' CNBC.com   23 Apr 2009   09:52 AM ET Art Cashin, UBS Financial Services director of floor operations, offered CNBC his take on what traders are watching Thursday  and his predictions for the stock market in coming days. After bouts of strong trading yesterday (Wednesday), what happened in the final hour to lower the market? "As I said to you a couple of days ago, I think there's nervousness back in the market. The next several days will tell us whether it's going to be a significant pullback or just a cleanup of the overbought condition." Cashin's own take? "I'm leaning toward a significant pullback." # Financial Stocks: Two Picks for the Long Run # Kudlow: Is TARP a Criminal Enterprise? As to the financial stocks, Cashin warned that the stress test could be a "ticking time bomb": "If it's a real 'stress test,' we could be back where we were in the pre-Lehman days," he said, with big banks dichotomized into survivors and those which look healthy  but suddenly collapse. _____________________________ Thursday - CNBC's Companies in the News: Wells Fargo Bank of America General Motors General Electric Citigroup _____________________________ Disclaimer  2009 CNBC.com URL: http://www.cnbc.com/id/30366884/
