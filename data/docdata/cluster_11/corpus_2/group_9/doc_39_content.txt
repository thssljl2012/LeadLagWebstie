         Thanks trade2loose what a great resource. I looked up a few non-commulative bank prefs (different terms from the RBS but it was quite surprisign).  Barclays BCS-C 7.75% face value $25 trading at $14. Citigroup C-M 8.5% face value $25 trading at $17. Bank of America BML-N 6.7% face value $25 trading at $11.85  What strikes me straight away is what a huge discount the RBS Prefs trade at compared to these guys e.g. RBS-R at $7.
