Market Update 090401 http://biz.yahoo.com/mu/update.html 4:30 pm : A handful of economic reports helped stocks reverse early losses to post strong gains. The advance was challenged by a late selling effort for the second straight session, but buyers stepped in to offer their bids. Stocks initially traded with weakness as participants reacted to an ADP Employment Report that indicated 742,000 jobs were lost in March. Economists expected 663,000 job losses. While the report isn't always a precise predictor of the government's official nonfarm jobs report, which is due Friday, it does present a glimpse into labor market conditions. Stocks were given a boost upon the release of several other economic reports. Though the ISM Manufacturing Index for March showed continued contraction in manufacturing, it was essentially in-line with expectations at 36.3, and was up slightly from February's 35.8. Meanwhile, monthly construction spending for February decreased 0.9%, but that was met with a positive reaction since it wasn't as severe as the 1.9% decline that was widely expected. A surprise 2.1% increase in February pending home sales also helped improve sentiment. Pending home sales were expected to remain unchanged after declining 7.7% in January. The broad-based buying effort that followed the reports helped push the S&amp;P 500 past the 800 level, but the move slowed as the benchmark index encountered 810. Still, the S&amp;P 500 was able to close just above that technical hurdle. Meanwhile, the Dow swung some 275 points from its session low to its close. The reversal was brought about by broad-based strength as 27 of its 30 components logged a gain. General Motors (GM 1.93, -0.01) was a laggard in the Dow after the company reported U.S. sales for March fell 45% year-over-year. The consensus estimate called for a 48% year-over-year drop. Ford (F 2.74, +0.11) reported U.S. sales for March fell almost 41% from the prior year, which was slightly less severe than the 45% drop that was expected. Given the troubles facing global automakers, Honda Motor Company (HMC 25.90, +2.20) announced it will further curtail production in North America, while also reducing salaries. Health care was the only sector to finish the session with a loss; it spent the entire session in the red before closing 0.3% lower. Biotech stocks traded with considerable weakness after Celgene (CELG 38.47, -5.93) reaffirmed a disappointing forecast.

May crude oil hit session lows at $47.26 per barrel in the afternoon and closed at $48.27 per barrel, down 2.8%. May natural gas experienced a sharp sell-off at the open of the pit trade and wasn't able to make a sustained recovery. The futures contracts hit session lows at $3.63 and closed the session at $3.68 per contract, down 2.6%. Precious Metals finished pit trading relatively unchanged. June gold spiked early in the pit trade to session highs of $935.80 per ounce, but ended the session at $927.70 per ounce, up less than 1%. May silver contracts traded between $12.83 and $12.99 per ounce for the session. The May contract closed just off session highs at $12.98 per ounce, down just a penny.DJ30 +113.65 NASDAQ +12.25 SP500 +8.54 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 1145/1493/1.9 bln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 876/2117/1.0 bln 3:00 pm : The S&amp;P 500 continues to flirt with the 810 level as participants head into the final hour of trading. Participants continue to watch whether buyers will push the S&amp;P 500 above the technical hurdle or if sellers will make a late appearance as they did in the prior session. Meanwhile, the Dow is showing solid gains. It was down roughly 125 points in the early going, but has since completely reversed that decline.DJ30 +141.98 NASDAQ +21.67 SP500 +12.46 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 1010/1607/1.67 bln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 846/2143/906 mln 2:30 pm : Stocks continue to climb higher. The S&amp;P 500 is now flirting with the 810 level, which presented some resistance earlier in the session. Support remains broad-based as advancing issues on the NYSE outnumber decliners by more than 3-to-1.DJ30 +148.54 NASDAQ +20.79 SP500 +13.22 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 964/1641/1.54 bln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 756/2228/829 mln 2:00 pm : The S&amp;P 500 hits a modest new session high. General Motors (GM 1.83, -0.11) reported a 42.5% drop in March sales, which was better than the expected drop of 45.8%, CNBC reports. Earlier today, Ford (F 2.62, -0.38) reported March U.S. sales fell 40.9%, versus the expected decline of 45%. Cleveland Fed President Pianalto said that the housing sector has not regained health, adding that the economy should stabilize by year's end, according to Dow Jones.DJ30 +128.31 NASDAQ +17.68 SP500 +11.25 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 1009/1578/1.38 bln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 820/2158/740 mln 1:30 pm : All three major indices continue to trade with solid gains, but the Dow is outpacing its counterparts. The Dow's ascent comes amid broad gains; 27 of its 30 components are trading higher. Boeing (BA 35.24, -0.34), General Motors (GM 1.81, -0.13), and Intel (INTC 15.01, -0.02) are the Dow's current decliners. Their drag, however, is being offset by strength in Caterpillar (CAT 29.03, +1.07).DJ30 +88.72 NASDAQ +12.25 SP500 +7.71 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 1093/1469/1.27 bln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 947/2003/677 mln 1:05 pm : Stocks traded with weakness in the first few minutes of the session, hampered by a discouraging ADP Employment Report, but a separate batch of economic data prompted participants to begin buying. Each of the major indices were down more than 1.5% in the early going as a selling effort that began late in the prior session extended into Wednesday. The decision to sell was supported by an ADP Employment Report that indicated 742,000 jobs were lost in March, while economists expected 663,000 job losses. The worse-than-expected tally suggests Friday's jobs report could prove disappointing. Stocks reversed early losses after the ISM Manufacturing Index for March came in at 36.3, which is essentially in-line with the expected reading of 36.0. Though it was up from the February reading of 35.8, the reading still indicates manufacturing activity is contracting. Construction spending for February decreased 0.9% month-over-month, which is less severe than the 1.9% decline that was expected. Spending fell 3.5% the month before. February pending home sales showed a surprise increase by climbing 2.1%. They were expected to remain unchanged after declining 7.7% in January. The broad-based buying effort that followed the midmorning economic reports helped push the S&amp;P 500 back above the 800 level. It has had difficulty climbing to 810, however. Health care remains the only major sector to trade with a loss. Health care is currently down 0.9%, primarily due to weakness in biotech stocks (-3.8%). Automakers are also showing weakness, though Treasury Secretary Geithner said no decision has been made to force General Motors (GM 1.82, -0.12) into bankruptcy, according to Reuters. GM is expected to report March North American sales to be down 48%. Ford (F 2.58, -0.05) reported March U.S. sales fell 40.9%. Education service companies are also seeing pressure, though Apollo Group (APOL 65.50, -12.83) posted better-than-expected earnings for its latest quarter. DJ30 +80.52 NASDAQ +11.60 SP500 +6.14 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 1059/1493/1.19 bln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 954/1996/635 mln 12:30 pm : Broad-based gains continue to lift the major indices. Telecom is currently seeing the best gain of any major sector as it advances 2.5%, thanks to strength in shares of integrated telcos AT&amp;T (T 25.78, +0.58) and Verizon (VZ 30.98, +0.78). Materials stocks are also seeing solid gains. The sector is up 2.4% with help from steel stocks (+4.3%) and diversified metals and mining companies (+3.5%). Though the financial sector isn't sporting the best gains this session, it continues to provide a key element of support. Financials are curently up 2.3% with leadership from Bank of America (7.09, +0.27), which is planning to sell its Columbia Management business and First Republic Bank, according to The Wall Street Journal.DJ30 +104.02 NASDAQ +17.34 SP500 +8.68 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 939/1571/1.05 bln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 810/2134/571 mln 12:00 pm : The stock market continues adding to earlier gains. The upward move had slowed as the S&amp;P 500 tested the 800 level from the underside, but conviction among buyers has pushed the S&amp;P 500 above that psychological level. Gains remain broad-based as approximately 70% of the companies listed in the S&amp;P 500 trade higher. DJ30 +82.75 NASDAQ +14.56 SP500 +6.85 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 937/1524/955 mln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 832/2076/513 mln 11:30 am : Education service companies are battling a concerted selling effort in the wake of a quarterly earnings report from Apollo Group (APOL 66.90, -11.43). Apollo posted better-than-expected earnings, student starts, and retention rates amid lower acquisition costs. However, the company did indicate in its conference call that bad debt expense may continue to increase in the near term. Shares of APOL are at their lowest level in roughly two weeks. Shares of Corinthian Colleges (COCO 18.90, -0.55) and Career Education Corp (CECO 22.11, -1.85) are trading lower in sympathy.DJ30 +62.28 NASDAQ +9.28 SP500 +5.30 NASDAQ Dec/Adv/Vol 998/1426/827 mln NYSE Dec/Adv/Vol 961/1927/458 mln 11:00 am : The major indices are sporting solid gains after overcoming a fit of weakness in the first few minutes of trading. The upward push has been broad-based, but the turnaround by financials is possibly the most impressive.
