            Hmmm, so, a day after the interview, DOW Jones Newswires runs the story again....        Meredith Whitney: Banks Likely To Return To Losses-Bloomberg     DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   Last update: 4/21/2009 10:27:46 AM       U.S. banks will likely return to "negative earnings" after posting first-quarter profits, Meredith Whitney, of the Meredith Whitney Advisory Group said in an interview with Bloomberg Television Monday.      Whitney said conditions at Bank of America Corp. (BAC) that boosted first-quarter earnings, including widening credit spreads and gains in agency paper sales, aren't "replicable." "The underlying credit is deteriorating at an accelerated pace," she said.      The window to raise equity capital has closed and banks will begin selling non-core assets, Whitney said. "You will see what I describe as a yard sale."
