    Earnings worries drive up default costs         By Paul J Davies, Nicole Bullock and Mike Mackenzie    Published: April 21 2009 19:58   Last updated: April 21 2009 19:58    The cost of protecting banks and insurers against default has risen sharply in the past couple of days as investors in both equity and credit markets showed renewed signs of skittishness over the durability of bank earnings and over the results of the US stress tests.    US banks including Bank of America and Citi have reported better-than-expected earnings in the past week or so, yet the past two days have seen an end to a six-week rally in equity markets and a near three-week rally in credit derivatives.    Although a number of US banks reported numbers that, on the surface, were surprisingly good, questions of earnings sustainability have come to the fore, said Dave Klein of Credit Derivatives Research. Given how quickly the banks rallied, the pull-back is not surprising.    Bank of America and Citigroup suffered some of the biggest moves on Tuesday in US markets for credit default swaps, which provide a kind of insurance against non-payment of corporate debt.    In early trade, Bank of Americas cost of protection was up 30 basis points at 305bp, according to brokers Phoenix Partners, while Citi was 50bp wider at 635bp. That means it costs $635,000 per year to insure $10m of Citi debt for five years.    The CDR Counterparty Risk index, which includes some of worlds largest banks including Citi, Deutsche Bank and UBS, was at 249.2 as of midday on Tuesday versus 210.9 last week.    In Europe, the banks that recorded the biggest increases were Credit Suisse, which was 14.48bp wider at 188.33bp, Commerzbank, 14.33bp wider at 151.33bp, and Barclays, up 12.54bp at 200.50bp.    Insurers were hit harder in Europe. Swiss Re was 31.75bp wider at 522.50bp, Aegon was 19.58bp wider at 382.50bp, and Aviva was up 17.09bp at 330.00bp.    Broader credit markets were weaker on Tuesday morning following sharp increases in costs of protection on Monday. They recovered a little on Tuesday afternoon but still finished worse for the second day in a row.    The main iTraxx Europe index of investment-grade bonds was 2.54bp higher at 157.25bp, which followed Mondays rise in the cost of protection of 6.41bp, the first increase since April 1. The US CDX was 2bp wider on Tuesday at 188.94bp, following Mondays 9.42bp rise.    Mondays moves came alongside sharp drops in equity markets and further pressure early on Tuesday. While investment-grade credit derivatives markets have performed well since the start of April, cash bond markets have seen spreads remain highly elevated, which some have seen as a sign that stock markets were getting too excited.     History has shown whenever bond and stock investors have conflicting views, bond investors usually win, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. We need to see credit spread improvement to support sustained gains in stocks.
