         Hi Guys,   WFC needs the most ($50B)  (table doesn't address Citi(C), or GMAC)   Table in article...    Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. lead a list of U.S. banks that may need another $1 trillion of capital to cushion losses as unemployment rises, KBW Inc. analysts said today.   The estimate applies to the entire industry and is based on the analysts own stress test of the strength of top U.S. lenders, according to KBWs Frederick Cannon. The government is also evaluating the ability of 19 of the biggest firms to withstand a deepening recession.   The $1 trillion tally combines estimates of new investments and exchanges of government preferred shares into common. The following is a list of firms being reviewed by the government and the capital need of each as estimated by KBW. Numbers are in billions of dollars. KBW didnt discuss GMAC LLC, the auto and home lender, or Citigroup Inc. The analysts didnt conclude how the tests would grade life insurer MetLife Inc. or whether money manager State Street Corp. would need more capital.    rk (bank bagholder)
