Financial Winners and Losers: AIG The Street.com - Elizabeth Trotta 04/23/09 - 11:47 AM EDT Banks were on the whole slightly higher late Thursday morning, partly fueled by an earnings report from Credit Suisse(CS). The KBW Bank Index was higher by about 0.4% recently. Among the day's better performers, Wells Fargo (WFC ) was gaining 6%, and Deutsche Bank (DB) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) were adding about 3% each. Shares of American International Group(AIG) were rising 2.8%, but that equates to just 4 cents. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse was rising more than 12% after the bank swung to a greater-than-expected profit of about $1.72 billion. In other earnings, SunTrust Banks(STI) posted a second consecutive quarterly loss, but it topped expectations factoring out a goodwill charge. Deposit growth and higher mortgage lending helped to offset charges resulting from the troubled real estate market, but bad loans continued to increase for the Southeast regional bank. Shares were losing about 3.5% to $14.86. Morgan Stanley(MS) and Citigroup(C ) were also on the losing end, falling more than 2% each. Elsewhere, Bank of America(BAC) was rising about 1.8% after making headlines unrelated to earnings. BofA CEO Ken Lewis testified that he was urged by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and former head of the U.S. Treasury Henry Paulson to keep quiet as arrangements were made for his bank's acquisition of troubled brokerage Merrill Lynch, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. On Friday, regulators will begin briefing banks about how they fared in the so-called stress tests, which gauged the health of the biggest 19 banks in the nation. The government will afford lenders the opportunity to debate the findings before they're made public in the coming days, according to media reports earlier this week.
