Instead of doing a write up on Sun, am doing it now.             Recap:     Last 6-7 weeks is a good run up.    Base on what ??? --- hingsight :    --- US Treasury/Fed actions were taken positively.    --- Insiders and those in accounts depts would have known result for 1st Q is better than the expectations; as shown by the results releasing now, eg Apple, Citibank Ebay etc. I think this was "leaked".    --- US 10 year bonds yield at 2.45% has risen to 2.95 last Fri; ie sell bonds buy equities.         Currently     --- Most earning results are better than expected.    --- News is slightly positive    --- Market sentiment is bullish.         What Next ???     --- A major bad news or a series of small bad news could trigger a deeper retracement.    --- US bank stress test, could be positively reveal by officials but market may want to look at the negative side; as this is not addressing the "toxic assets".    --- Current earning results by financial companies are camouflaging the hidden problem. Operation is profitable, the toxic assets are still there.        Another words, the run up has reflected all that are positive into current price level/indices. Next 2-3 weeks has nothing so positive to continue the push up. Expectation is for a retracement during these 2-3 weeks. After that, then analyse the situation, likely net positive at that time.    Cheese.
