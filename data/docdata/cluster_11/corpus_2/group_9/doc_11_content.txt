BOI Year end 31st March, should get the preliminary results around May 22nd.  BOI won't be like Wall st. banks where they are allowed to revalue their assets, hence Goldman Sachs  the Bank of America, and Citi posting a profit in the Billions, what a trick, any sign of a dividend? don't hold your breath!     As for E4.00 in a few years time...I hope you're right, the only thing is...Lending is weak, as there is no demand for credit, add that to possible more write downs and it begins to look even worse.  If the gov do nationalise they may maintain a listing, albeit BOI will be just a Zombie BANK! With a static share price of around 5c......
