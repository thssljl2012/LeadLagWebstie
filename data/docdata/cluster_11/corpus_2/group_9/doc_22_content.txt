 Bank of America Short Sales May Rise: Credit Suisse (Update2)                       By Edgar Ortega and Jeff Kearns    April 23 (Bloomberg) -- Options traders are bracing for an increase in the cost to borrow shares of    Bank of America Corp.   , a sign they are speculating the lender may convert some of its preferred shares into common stock, Credit Suisse Group AG said.     &#8220;Options are pricing in a significant likelihood that eventually Bank of America will be subject to a preferred-to- common conversion,&#8221; Credit Suisse derivatives strategist    Sveinn Palsson    said in a note to clients today.     Regulators may release preliminary estimates to banks as early as tomorrow on whether the 19 biggest U.S. financial companies have enough capital to withstand further credit losses. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said April 21 that banks found to need additional capital after the so-called stress tests will have a range of options for shoring up their balance sheets, including the conversion of government investments from preferred into common shares.     Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender by assets, may be forced to accept additional aid by converting between $15 billion and $20 billion of preferred shares into common stock, KBW Inc. analysts led by    Frederick Cannon    said today. The conversion would boost the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank&#8217;s tangle common equity, a measure of its ability to absorb losses.     Stock Rises     Bank of America    added    6.8 percent to $8.82 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is down 37 percent this year, compared with a 24 percent retreat for the KBW Bank Index.     The company already received two rounds of federal help, with the U.S. holding $45 billion of Bank of America preferred shares. The government also guaranteed $118 billion of assets and the bank raised $41.7 billion selling debt guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as part of that agency&#8217;s effort to bolster lenders.     Borrowing costs for    Citigroup Inc.    surged last month after the New York-based lender announced a plan to covert as much as $52.5 billion in preferred stock. The proposal fueled a fivefold gain in short interest for Citigroup as investors sought to capitalize by buying the preferred and shorting the stock.        Short interest    on Bank of America has increased 36 percent to 151.9 million since Feb. 27 when the Citigroup conversion was announced. Short interest for financial companies on the New York Stock Exchange fell 1.9 percent from Feb. 27 through March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.     The implied cost to borrow shares based on options trades has jumped to 35 cents from less than 5 cents at the end of February, according to Credit Suisse&#8217;s Palsson. Investors executing so-called conversion trades, which require the simultaneous purchase of a put and the sale of call contract, are paying more than the current rate to borrow the stock for an ordinary short sale.     &#8220;The only rational explanation must be that it&#8217;s in anticipation of a spike in borrowing costs and short interest,&#8221; Palsson said today.     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------         Looks as of the Street expects BAC to issue Common shares for the Pfd at its book value on the date it the pfd were issued. That would really benifit BAC, However since the Bank already exceeds the Stress test bar , I don't believe it will happen. ((Just my Opinion))         Kirby
