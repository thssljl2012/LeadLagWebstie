 Yeah these CVA FAS-159 adjustments are now hitting the banks.  The monolines used them to boos their GAAP earnings, now the banks.         JPM had the smallest FAS-159 CVA at around 700MM from memory.         CVA is probably the worst quality GAAP earnings boost I can think of out side of pure revenue fraud.         Spin   msg 128060
