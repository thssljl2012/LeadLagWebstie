        October 2, 2008, 10:28 am KLAC Slides; Gloomy Tidings From Barclays, RBC, FBR Posted by Eric Savitz   KLA-Tencor (KLAC) share have been hit today by downgrades from analyst at both RBC Capital and Barclays Capital, along with estimate and target reductions from Friedman Billings Ramsey. Heres a summary of the analyst moves:   Barclay Capitals C.J. Muse cut his rating on the stock to Underweight from Equal Weight, chopping his price target on the stock to $25 from $30. Muse slashes his FY June 2009 EPS estimate to $1.12 from $1.48; for FY 2010 he goes to $1.74, from $2.12. He contends that consensus estimates are too high, and that concerns remain about loss of market share.  Muse says Q3 orders are tracking at down 35%, versus guidance of down 5%-25% .   RBC Capitals Mahesh Sanganeria cut his rating on the stock to Underperform from Sector Perform; his price target drops to $26, from $34. His FY 2009 EPS estimate drops to 95 cents, from $1.27.  Sanganeria sees 2009 semi cap ex down 18%, with wafer fab equipment spending down 2%-5% more than that. That follows an estimated 30% drop in 2008 .   Friedman Billings Ramseys Mehdi Hosseini maintains his Outperform rating, but his target drops to $37 from $45. He cut his FY 09 estimate to 89 cents from $1.61. Despite the positive rating, Hosseini writes that we do not see any catalyst for the stock in the near term.   Note that RBCs Sanganeria also cut his rating on Rudolph Technologies (RTEC) to Underperform from Sector Perform,  citing the same gloomy outlook for semiconductor capital equipment spending in 2009 .   KLAC is down 94 cents, or 3%, to $30.06 ; RTEC is down 47 cents, or 5.6%, to $7.86
