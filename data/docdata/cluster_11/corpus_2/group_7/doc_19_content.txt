Stocks have rallied off their lows and into positive territory. There was no specific catalyst responsible for the move but the averages are being helped by two names in the financial sector. Both the shares of General Electric (GE:$12.6518,$1.5518,13.98%) and Bank of America (BAC:$6.79,00$0.66,0010.77%) are trading higher by more than +11.0% and are pulling the equity markets with them. Although investors seem to be in a holding pattern as they wait for the government stimulus plans, the markets have a decidedly positive tone.
