 BQI Message Board Posts          Recs: 7              My thoughts and my stocks    These are my thoughts and my stock choices - not advice. I base the below on my own common sense, research and on what I think after listening to a lot of Financial talk radio and TV shows:    Oil will be back above $60 by the end of this year     Current Financial stimulus packages will be highly inflationary a few years down the road.    Commodities, metals, oil, copper, steel etc. are extremely oversold currently  example Freeport\Mcmoran Copper and Gold (great company, very manageable debt) 30 down from $120, BQI down 75% etc. I own shares in both.    Commodities, metals, oil, gas, copper, steel will rise rapidly with recovery and inflation     Golden opportunity to buy and hold companies with these assets    The US government is not going to let any more major US Financial Institutions go out of business  the consensus is that they made a mistake with Lehman. Companies like Bank of America (with that name can you imagine what the average Joe Schmos of the world would think if they heard that the BANK OF AMERICA is BANKRUPT?), Wells Fargo, JPM, Citibank are at unbelievable lows and the risk/reward at this time is heavily skewed to the reward side. I own shares in BAC.     As far as BQI goes it seems like some people on this board are trying to scare people out of their shares. BQI will not go Bankrupt! I believe BQI is a great buy now for the following reasons: the current oversold oil price, the future inflation, the huge reserves, the company has enough cash for their immediate testing and can then hibernate for over a year after if necessary. I also believe that if they put their mind to it and the oil price recovers enough this year they can start producing by the end of the year at low levels  even if they have to truck the oil to a pipeline. Say if they could made a profit of $10 per barrel and produced 3000 barrels per day that still is 10 million per year  enough maybe to pay the payroll and expand slowly and keep the company alive for the big payoff. I also think that Sask. will do all in its power to be accommodating to BQI and get the ball rolling on production.    My favorite stock that I have been following through ups and downs for almost 7 years now - Oncolytics Biotech - This company is shooting for first and second line cancer therapy in 60 to 70% of all cancer types including and especially the most deadly metastatic types - like head and neck, Sarcoma, Pancreatic,Colorectal etc.. They use a live virus that kills only the cancer cells and are getting statistically impressive results in their trials.  8 clinical trials completed and 11 currently active worldwide. Cancer Therapy &amp; Research Center at The University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio ( A National Cancer Institute Center) just announced that they will sponser up to 5 more trials (because the product  REOLYSIN - is working extremely well in the two clinical trials already running there - with terminally ill metastatic Sarcoma patients and terminally ill metastatic Head and Neck cancer patients).  At least three years to registration but stock will pop long before that and possibly be bought out. Today the stock is at 1.45 US with only 43 million shares outstanding. I own a lot of shares of Oncolytics.
