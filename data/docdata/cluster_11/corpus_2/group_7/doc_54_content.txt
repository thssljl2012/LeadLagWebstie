          There is nothing inherantly special about gold as a means of exchange.  Gold however does make a good means of exchange. It's dense and compact. It doesn't go off. It is hard to get hold of.   I think you contradict yourself a bit there, Nick, because gold  is  very special. As well as the qualities you list gold is also easily divisible, malleable, almost impossible to forge (think density) and recognisable worldwide. It is pretty much the perfect money which is why it evolved and has been used as such for centuries. For this reason if govmnts decide they once again need to return to 'hard money', i.e. if and when the paper experiment implodes, then it will once again be gold. It's quite simply the best alternative to fiat that exists.  IMO the best way to view what's happening with prices at the moment is not so much gold rising but fiat falling. And as long as the printing presses are rolling that's a one-way process.  lfc
