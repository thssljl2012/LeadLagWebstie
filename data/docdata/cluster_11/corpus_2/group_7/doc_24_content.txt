   Yet again, Kato, LoT, Oldsalt, etc. need to be versed on simple stock market facts. The stocks do not fall in response to a planned event, they fall in anticipation of a future event. Obama signing the bill was not the cause of the stock market falling.    "U.S. stocks fell sharply Tuesday as fears about the solvency of manufacturing giant General Motors and banking giants Citigroup and Bank of America brought the Dow Jones Industrial Average to within a third of a point of a 5 1/2-year closing low."     http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/us-stks-off-djia-comes/story.aspx?guid={52EF61A7-B266-48C4-9E51-AE6809D97198}&amp;dist=msr_5
