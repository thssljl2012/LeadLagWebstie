              Hi Ronz, not sure what I feel about ACAS at the moment.  It sure isn't behaving very well in an up market today.  I had hoped that the proxy would not dillute the share value that much and the leverage it gave would produce some good results.  The latter remains to be seen, but it sure has been dilluted!  I keep wondering what I am missing here, ACAS should not be at this level, yet there it is and it just keeps sinking.  Then again so does Bank of America, another favorite of mine.  Bank of America is unbelieveably low, so low it's downright scary and I wonder what will become of it?  Will pension funds divest because of the stock price being too low?   I think institutions are leaving ACAS for that reason alone and that is some of the stock price damage.
