 BAC Message Board Posts          Recs: 4              Re: How Low??   I think that tomorrow BAC will bounce back upward because of options expiration.  And if their is someone from the Treasury that can leak it out that the money center banks will not be nationalized that would make my day!  I am a long time shareholder and it would be un american to nationalized a bank with the title: Bank Of America.  What impression would that give to the world; that America's bank failed??    I don't see it happening but you never know.  It a politically driven action and the Democrats are at it again with some conservative Republicans.  If they do BAC; they should do JPM and Jamie Dimon too! One for all and all for one!       thread start
