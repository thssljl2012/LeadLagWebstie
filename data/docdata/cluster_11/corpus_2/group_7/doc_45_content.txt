Silly, silly chatter, absurd discussions, about RCC Holdings Corporation. Bank of America common shares more than $40.00 dollars 6 months past. Today buy that Bank of America common share for $3.79 cents. Rcch six months past .0004. So you're telling me Gene Newton is driving and doing a better game or job, than Bank of America. My God, I gonna hold all my RCCH shares. Might even buy some more RCCH shares.
