Hi smartone, I really don't have more issues on my active watch list, but there has been a fairly significant change in my idea of which kinds present better opportinities as regards movement. I don't trade etf's (such as QQQQ, IWM, SPY, etc) as much. What I'm favoring is individual stocks that seem to have some connection to the political and economic situations, and have sufficient contract activity to be able to get aboard and dismount with little difficulty. I don't spend much if any time at all in searching -- I don't have any screens and all that. No time to fool with it. A smart trader that I watch increased his wad 550% last year and he only trades a single issue. When queried, he says "the devil I know is better than the one I don't". I try to "know" just a few pretty well. Here's my present list of particular interest: WMT (WalMart) X (U.S. Steel) AMZN (Amazon) JPM (J P Morgan Chase) GS (Goldman Sachs) BAC (Bank of America) USO (Oil Fund etf) MS (Morgan Stanley) SPY (SP500 etf) - because it's big.
