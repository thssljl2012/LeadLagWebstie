Units              are expected to trade flat, which means accrued interest will be              reflected in the trading price and the purchasers will not pay and the              sellers will not receive any accrued and unpaid interest. The              InterNotes are direct unsecured subordinated obligations of the company              and will rank equally with all existing and future unsecured and              subordinated indebtedness of the company.
