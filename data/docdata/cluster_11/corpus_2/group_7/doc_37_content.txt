 CWEI Message Board Posts          Recs: 3              If you think Petroleum stocks are terrible, look at the financials-   Two years ago you could have gotten into those great dividend paying stocks like Citi Corp (C) and or Bank of America (BAC) at prices over $50 per share.  Now these big powerful institutions are being treated as if they are not going to be around much more.  Who can the Treasury and Fed get to merge with them as they finally admit they are insolvent?  I think it might be either the East Bank or the West Bank of the Mississippi River just before the spring floods.    It is my opinion that President Obama should call a press conference and announce that it is impossible to keep these poorly run financial organizations alive and the baton is being passed to the new generation of smaller banks who practiced sound lending practices. And don't forget to let go of AIG with those impossible credit default swaps at the same time.  This should bring a resolution to the global financial mess.  Kill to cure is my cry.   Regards
