     Obama will make the next bailout know - next week.         Banking stocks might ralley for a few days, before going lower.         ------------------         Japan went through a similar banking and real estate crisis. 1990 to 2000 - Ten years.         In those 10 years, Japan had 9 different bailouts - none worked.  Not one.      Investors took a bath for 10 years, with a few sucker rallies.         Do yourself a favor, look at chart of Japan (nikkie) from 1990 to 2000.      Study the real estate bubble in japan that topped in 1990.         Time will tell, if the US real estate bubble will be similar.         Time will tell - it always does.      Hindsight is always perfect.
