 CVTX Message Board Posts          Recs: 0              Script projections mine vs. Citigroup     If you are going to try and project scripts using a linear and/or polynomial projection you are in very hazardous territory. This is just what Yaron Weber has attempted to do in his latest note on CVTX in projecting U S scripts for Ranexa using a linear model. The selection of a projection method is very subjective and in the chart in the link below I have chosen projections that suit my view. While it is true that US scripts have been linear in the past it is not unreasonable to expect that there may be some exponential growth in the immediate future. Also it is very clear that the growth in US scripts is not the full story. The European launch is material and Lexiscan is also an important part of the story. The chart in the link below is for your amusement and speculation only and is intended to illustrate how simplistic Yaron Weber&#8217;s most recent attempt at analysis and forecasting are. Better numbers ahead in my opinion.      Link to chart:       http://img172.imageshack.us/img172/231/108weektrendprojectionrbk8.jpg       Click on the display to sharpen the image.      You can access the latest Citibank research at the link below if you register for the site. With Citi research or any research for that matter take the facts they provide and ignore the opinions. This is also the site where I get the script numbers when they publish them. This week script numbers were scattered around in various analytical reports, but not published in one convenient summary report as they sometimes are.       https://www.smithbarney.com/cgi-bin/login/login.cgi
