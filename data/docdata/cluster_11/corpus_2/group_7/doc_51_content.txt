The stocks do not fall in response to a planned event, they fall in anticipation of a future event. Obama signing the bill was not the cause of the stock market falling.    "U.S. stocks fell sharply Tuesday as fears about the solvency of manufacturing giant General Motors and banking giants Citigroup and Bank of America brought the Dow Jones Industrial Average to within a third of a point of a 5 1/2-year closing low."

The Dow plunged nearly 300 points and barely avoided making a new six-year low Tuesday   as the markets continue to worry   the government's rescue   efforts won't stop the nation's economic bleeding any time soon.            The latest selloff illustrates   how   confused   the markets remain about the Treasury Departments latest financial rescue plan and how  skeptical  many are   about the speed of the $787 billion stimulus package President Barack Obama signed into law on Tuesday.     We are concerned that the three-pronged approach -- stimulus package, financial rescue and foreclosure initiatives -- is just going to take a whole lot longer than we thought a month ago. That should've been something we wrapped our arms around a while ago, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies &amp; Co.    By a fraction of a point, the Dow ended above the crucial 7552.29 level at which the benchmark index settled in November for the first time since 2003. Since hitting a record high of 14164 in November 2007, the Dow has lost 46.7% of its value, including a drop of 13.9% in 2009 alone. The S&amp;P 500, which traders follow more closely, fell below the crucial 800 level Tuesday to the lowest level since Nov. 20.      We just arent sure that everything the government is doing is going to be quick enough to bail us out of the trouble we are in,    said Ryan Detrick, equity analyst at Schaeffers Investment Research. Were in the camp that November was not the lows and we do think this market is going to continue to go lower. The problems are still there.                     Obviously the stock market is fearing Obama's plan.. and the future of the market..                    Last edited on Tue Feb 17th, 2009 11:36 pm by  katoblue
