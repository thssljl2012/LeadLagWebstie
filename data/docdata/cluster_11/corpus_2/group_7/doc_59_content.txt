         Exactly, its a bubble because people view it as a safe haven from fiat money inflation.   My view is that we will get fiat money being printed hand over fist.   My view is also that people still view gold as a safe haven, and as long as that remains the case, gold currently is good move.  If the view is that gold isn't a safe haven, then the price will collapse.  Nick
