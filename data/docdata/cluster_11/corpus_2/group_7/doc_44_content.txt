 ELN Message Board Posts          Recs: 1              Schaeffer's: Recap of today    Market Recap: Dow Breaks 7,500 as Financial Stocks Lead the Decline    The blue chips swallowed their lowest daily close since October 2002    by Elizabeth Harrow (eharrow@sir-inc.com) 2/19/2009 4:28 PM         Text Size        Email a friend        Print        Share                                                                                   Keywords:     HPQ        ABK        DECK        PCLN        stocks        options        commodities        economy        weekly          Stocks  started the day on positive footing, as an onslaught of downbeat news  failed to truly rattle investors. On the economic front, the number of   U.S. workers filing for unemployment    last week remained stuck near record highs, while the Philly Fed Index  plummeted to an 18-year low of negative 41.3. Meanwhile, in earnings  news, Dow component Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) was pummeled with  price-target cuts after   slashing its full-year forecast  .    Although this trio of reports apparently carried little weight with  investors, a rebound in crude oil prices seemed to strike a chord. The  Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported an unexpected slide in  oil supplies, which propelled black gold to its heftiest percentage  gain of the year. As crude prices surged, stocks quickly sank into the  red.                     The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA  7,465.95) settled on a loss  of nearly 90 points, or 1.2%, as only 9 of its 30 components muscled  into positive territory. Today marks the Dow's lowest daily closing  price since Oct. 10, 2002, when the blue-chip barometer settled at  7,286.27. The DJIA also marked another unfortunate benchmark today,  setting a new 52-week low of 7,447.55 in intraday trading. Banking  issues set the pace for today's drop, with Citigroup (C) and Bank of  America (BAC) losing roughly 14% each.     The S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX  778.94) hasn't breached its bear-market  lows just yet, but the broad-market bellwether nevertheless shed 9.5  points, or 1.2%, in today's downbeat session. Finally, the Nasdaq  Composite (COMP  1,442.82) extended its stay beneath the 1,500 level,  giving up 25 points, or 1.7%.    Turning to equities in focus, Ambac Financial Group (ABK) announced plans to launch a new   public finance-only bond insurer   ... Deckers Outdoor Corporation (DECK) shrugged off a   price-target cut   from Wedbush Morgan ... priceline.com (PCLN) spiked after earnings as   short sellers rushed to cover   their bearish bets ... Dell (DELL) was targeted by   optimistic option players   in the wake of rival Hewlett-Packard's earnings ... Option players   gravitated toward puts   on range-bound Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) ... and today's   Quote of the Day   comes from Conan O'Brien, who's preparing to   take over for Jay Leno   as host of NBC's  The Tonight Show .  Judging by this comment, O'Brien has more than a few reservations about his move to the 11:35 p.m. time slot:       "I've spent my fair share of time at 3 in the morning, lying awake like Martin Sheen in [ Apocalypse Now ], staring at the ceiling fan, thinking about my trip up river -- and we all know how that turned out."      But these weren't the only headlines hitting the Street today.  Click on the links below for our  Daily Market Blog  coverage of:             Exxon Mobil (XOM)            UBS AG (UBS)            Diana Shipping (DSX)          and   General Motors (GM)            Crude prices enjoyed a major rally today, boosted by a government  report showing rising demand and waning supply. The EIA reported that  crude supplies fell by 200,000 barrels last week, defying analysts'  expectations for a gain of 2 million to 4 million barrels.  Simultaneously, the agency noted that the U.S. used nearly 20 million  barrels of petroleum products per day during the previous 4 weeks,  marking a 1-year peak of consumption. Against this backdrop, crude oil  for March delivery rocketed to a gain of $4.86, or 13.9%, to settle at  $39.48 per barrel -- closing just shy of the psychologically  significant $40 region.     Conversely, gold futures pulled back, retreating from a 7-month  closing high set on Wednesday. However, the malleable metal's momentum  was barely dented by today's bout of profit-taking, as weak economic  data and a down day in the equities market enhanced its safe-haven  allure. February-dated gold futures ended the session on a modest  decline of $1.60, or 0.2%, at $976.10 per ounce.     Levels to Watch in Trading:        Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA  7,465.95) - support at 7,500; resistance at 9,000    S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX  778.94) - support at 750; resistance at 1,000    Nasdaq Composite (COMP  1,442.82) - support at 1,300; resistance at 1,750
