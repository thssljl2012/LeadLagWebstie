You think we&amp;#039;r immature, we think you seriously lack of skills and coordination within your own members and overall with the other guilds in the server. Comunication, in a massive zerg online like warhammer should be, its something very important. Your social skills has bin proven to go under O.   We have alot of good players and i don&amp;#039;t think that insulting them with such poor words like &amp;#039;&amp;#039;assholes&amp;#039;&amp;#039; is the correct approach.   We never played CS. RUScorp know us from Guild Wars, wich game do you guys come from?                      No wonder you &amp;amp;quot;think&amp;amp;quot; a lot, considering how much of ORVR you did, &amp;amp;quot;thinking&amp;amp;quot; is all that&amp;#039;s left for you. In all honesty, every day in praag we have at least 2h of ORVR;I&amp;#039;ve seen Vanguard, The company, Order of Sweden, Order of death, Wladcy much and quite a few others but never Rated xXx or playah killah himself. I&amp;#039;ve seen you in a scenario once when you refused to join with our healer to recieve his group heals and thats basically all. Where the hell are you hiding hardcore pvpers?  And Erez was laughing becouse some consider us goddamned elitists and you are actually the first one who called us noobs;p I hope you will fight with your guild in praag a few times and look around a bit before making another post (but who am I fooling)  As for &amp;amp;quot;cba&amp;amp;quot; you mean you ignore our nice members and constructive posts and like to focus only on flame wars and drama? Speaks well of ya, champ.    PS. Dintra, I&amp;#039;m happy you wasn&amp;#039;t there;p As an archmage I felt a lot safer withaut this crazy RUScorp WE on my butt ;p
