In all honesty, every day in praag we have at least 2h of ORVR;I&amp;#039;ve seen Vanguard, The company, Order of Sweden, Order of death, Wladcy much and quite a few others but never Rated xXx or playah killah himself. I&amp;#039;ve seen you in a scenario once when you refused to join with our healer to recieve his group heals and thats basically all. Where the hell are you hiding hardcore pvpers?  And Erez was laughing becouse some consider us goddamned elitists and you are actually the first one who called us noobs;p I hope you will fight with your guild in praag a few times and look around a bit before making another post (but who am I fooling)  As for &amp;amp;quot;cba&amp;amp;quot; you mean you ignore our nice members and constructive posts and like to focus only on flame wars and drama? Speaks well of ya, champ.    PS. Dintra, I&amp;#039;m happy you wasn&amp;#039;t there;p As an archmage I felt a lot safer withaut this crazy RUScorp WE on my butt ;p                       We are momentarily not playng. Alot of us have IRL issius and some others are just bored out of WarHammer. We all signed up for Dark Fall beta but you should ask Most and IWIN since they&amp;#039;ve bin insulting me in the last scenario with they&amp;#039;r lvl 40 BW that managed to get 200k dmg with 2 poket healers.   Its funny when you mock someone and your results aint that much aniway isn&amp;#039;t it?

To end this, theres only 1 WE that is worth mention. Her name is lvi.
