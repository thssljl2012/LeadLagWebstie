         are you sure its v2.50 cos even in the previous versions if i had the bluetooth remote switched on i cudnt ave my controllers cos it wud jus freeze the screen, i fort they must ave fixed the problem. maybe they havent and its gne even worse.but i will wait for the otr versions i cba to call them cos i think ther is no problem with the bluetooth remote itself.        &amp;amp;nbsp;               Sony PS3 60GB Launch Version Assassins Creed Resistance Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare Fifa 08 GTA IV Fifa 09
