The Big Bikkies will be for Rivers..............sorry to disappont ya...........If Merriman wants to be &amp;amp;quot;reasonable&amp;amp;quot; with negotiations, he could still re-sign, if not, he&amp;#039;ll be &amp;amp;quot;Tagged&amp;amp;quot;..............then the whole CBA will come into play and God knows what will be after that.
