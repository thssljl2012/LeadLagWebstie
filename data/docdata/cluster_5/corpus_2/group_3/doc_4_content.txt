Competitive gamer or not, natuarally you just wanna blast through the game yourself and get a feel for the game. Any ways i cba arguing, had a fairly rubbish day so thought id take some anger on a gaming forum, yup im that sad.                           Dude, I pm&amp;#039;ed Alex and I also posted on this forum.  Perhaps I should have put an LOL after my post, but relax dude, I&amp;#039;m not freaking out.  I also didn&amp;#039;t say write an essay about competitive merit of GOW2.  I simply said can you please list the weapon swaps.      You&amp;#039;re on a forum for competitive gaming...who&amp;#039;s the nerds?
