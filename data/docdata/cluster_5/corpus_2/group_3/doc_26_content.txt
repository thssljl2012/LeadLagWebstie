YOUNGSTERS SHINE IN ALL-AUSTRALIAN CLASH    Friday 24 October 2008    Queensland&amp;amp;#8364;&amp;amp;#8482;s rising stars of Australian cricket have shone during a practice game between the Commonwealth Bank Southern Stars and the national under 21 side at Bankstown today.    Fifteen-year-old left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen made a huge impact with her opening spell of bowling, which included the wicket of two-time reigning Australian player of the year Lisa Sthalekar.    Called on to bowl when the senior Australians were going along at a cracking rate, Jonassen slowed the scoring with eight runs taken from her opening three overs before she had Sthalekar caught at slip top edging an attempted sweep.    Jonassen finished with 1-14 off four overs, with her older teammates given more of a bowl.    One of those was Konica Minolta Queensland Fire teammate Jo-Ann Verrall, who bowled with plenty of venom in her nine over spell which yielded 1-30.    Verrall&amp;amp;#8364;&amp;amp;#8482;s figures could have been even better had she not dropped two catches off her own bowling and had one chance spilled in the field.    The most costly was a simple caught and bowled chance off Australian opener Shelley Nitschke from the second ball she faced. Nitschke went on to make 57 before she retired.    Verrall also did some damage with the bat, making 21 off 23 balls at the death to help the Under 21s to get to 9-163 off their 50 overs.    The senior team cruised to the target with 10 overs to spare, so they were set a readjusted challenge of 214 off 50 overs.     They reached that as well, finishing at 5-215.    Fire captain Jodie Fields made 13 off 25 in the middle order before being bowled, while Delissa Kimmince and Kirsten Pike did not bat.    Kimmince took 2-48 off 10 overs in the Under 21 innings, taking some late stick from Verrall before getting revenge with her wicket.    Pike uncharacteristically was the most expensive of the Australian bowlers with 0-39 off six overs.           http://www.bulls.com.au/default.asp?...  omeNews=True
