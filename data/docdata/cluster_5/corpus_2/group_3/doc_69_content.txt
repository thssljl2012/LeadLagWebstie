JESS ENJOYS AUSSIE RUN    Thursday 23 October 2008    Teenage Rockhampton spinner Jessica Jonassen enjoyed her brief moment in the sun in international cricket yesterday before the clouds rolled in to put paid to her debut for the Commonwealth Bank Shooting Stars Australian Under-21 side.    Jonassen, 15, was the only wicket-taker against India at Bankstown Oval before heavy rain washed out the match with the visitors 1-72.    The left-arm finger spinner had figures of 1-16 from six overs, picking up the opening batter.    Her Konica Minolta Queensland Fire teammate Jo-Ann Verrall also played in the match, taking 0-14 from four overs.    The Shooting Stars will meet India again tomorrow in another one-day match.         http://www.bulls.com.au/default.asp?...  omeNews=True
