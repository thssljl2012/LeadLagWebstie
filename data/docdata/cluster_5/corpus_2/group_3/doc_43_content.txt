Thanks Carlo for posting the news!    Dean, andito na po ako sa forum like what I&amp;#039;ve promised when I visited CBA last September..      To all my CBA colleagues, granduates and students, I may not be as intelligent as other graduates and not a CPA produced by MSEUF-CBA, but we can humbly share whatever we can, even our own little talents and skills, to let the world know, that our department, CBA, have so many things to be proud of !!      BETANO po ako!!
