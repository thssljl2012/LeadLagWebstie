Im not sure I agree with that. Flintoff has played many good innings against the moving ball, even at Edgbaston in the SA series he looked fairly good when the ball was moving around a bit got 30 odd before he ran everyone else out. He plays with a very straight bat, gets in good positions with his feet, has good balance and all of the shots in the book. All of his 3 100s in ODIs and even his 99 against India came in fairly difficult conditions when he was in very early in the game. His only technical issue is that he plays with hard hands and he tends to poke at deliveries outside of the off stump. But its not like hes incompetent against the moving ball as people seem to be making him out to be.

He is not in particularly good form and a few lusty blows in the dying overs may bring back some of that lost belief.                      But it is as an impact player that Flintoff has failed miserably in ODIs. His best innings in ODIs have been when hes come in early. Hes always been a far better player when hes been allowed to settle in and then start to play his shots ala Edgbaston 2005 rather than when hes tried to hit from the go as he will undoubtedly be expected to do batting at no 6 or 7. Even if he is to perform a role similar to Mal Loye in the Commonwealth bank series, he would still be providing a bigger contribution to England than any other opener in the side possibly could.
