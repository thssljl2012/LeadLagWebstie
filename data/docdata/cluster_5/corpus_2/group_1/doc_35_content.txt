In way you ae right,, this is the best team to date. With Shahadat/Mashraeee as the opening bowlers, Razzaque/Alok/Saqib/Farhad in the middle,,, this is the best we had to date. With Tamim/Mehrab contrast,,, Ashraful/Raqibul/Saqib middle order and Alok/Farhad or Riad as the all rounders and the dependable Dhiman,,, we have a solid combnation of players ho can really produce some good results if clicked... The key being (click). These players can bring down any  team if they really have the  &amp;quot;Dhiman&amp;quot; head,, and bit of luck..
