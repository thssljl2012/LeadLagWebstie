Dhrubo, I think a little different:      If All /large majority in a class fails, that&amp;#039;s the fault of the teacher without any question. He has not taught or he has failed to teach.      If some/a few of the students fail, then it goes to the students first &amp;amp;amp; then the teacher. The passed students have proven that the teacher has taught. But still the teacher shares secondary responsibility for the failures.      Well that&amp;#039;s my understanding. In our case, almost all of the boys are failing almost repeatedly.
