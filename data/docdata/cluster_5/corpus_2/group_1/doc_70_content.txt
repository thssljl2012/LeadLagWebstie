it&amp;#039;s a dail-bhat formula for us:      tamim would play his zealous aggressive cricket and get out after a 30-ball 50. Mehrab will be the more steady one scoring 70. Then Ashraful would resuscitate his cardiff flair and get a century. Raqibul would continue his superb form and consistency of average and score 53. Saqib would show his tenacity, the one against pakis where he scored a century and score a 101. kapali would be devastating as his usual esp. the one against india and score 83. mashrafe would slog the s$#! out of aussies in the last few overs and bring in 9 ball 21. So what are we looking at here? 50+70+100+53+101+83+21=478.      I think 478 would be competetive to say the least.
