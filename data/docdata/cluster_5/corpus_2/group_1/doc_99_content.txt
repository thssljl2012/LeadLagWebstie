Sensible batting should do it. The ball isn&amp;#039;t coming onto the bat, so just play with soft hands and rotate the strike. We have enough depth to hit out near the end if the need arises. For now, the focus should be on keeping the wickets intact and scoring at a healthy rate without taking any undue risks.
