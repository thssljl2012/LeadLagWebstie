 Miraz bhai, could you please stop blaming Siddons already? You can&amp;#039;t always blame the coach. Was he the reason behind the poor slection shots? NO. Because the players don&amp;#039;t learn from their mistakes and still play silly shots. That&amp;#039;s not Siddons fault even with Whatmore as the coach we played shots like that. Yes I agree that Whatmore at least produced wins but it was his decision to leave and now what he did is a thing of the past, this is the future and it will take time before they can be a good team. I think it wil be 2-3 years before they can start beating good teams. Itz every1z fault they lost this badly but don&amp;#039;t just blame Siddons.
