                   HAYDEN MUST PROVE FITNESS FOR DARWIN SERIES    Friday 15 August 2008    Matthew Hayden will have to prove his fitness over the next fortnight, while four other Queenslanders were included alongside him for the upcoming Australian one-day series against Bangladesh.    Australia meet Bangladesh in the Commonwealth Bank series clashes at Marrara on 31 August, and 3 and 6 September.    All-rounders James Hopes, Shane Watson and Andrew Symonds have been named in the 14-man squad, as has left-arm paceman Mitchell Johnson, although he is now recognised as being from WA.    Hayden&amp;amp;#8364;&amp;amp;#8482;s progress will be closely ,monitored in the lead up after missing the final Test and all of the one day series in the May-June tour of the West Indies.    &amp;amp;#8364;&amp;amp;#339;Matthew Hayden has been selected in this side subject to fitness. His progress has been monitored closely by our physiotherapist and doctor and his overall participation in the series will be determined as we get closer to the date,&amp;amp;#8364;&amp;amp;#157; said chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch.    &amp;amp;#8364;&amp;amp;#339;The National Selection Panel has reserved the right to add a 15th player into this squad should this become necessary.&amp;amp;#8364;&amp;amp;#157;    Coach Tim Nielsen was optimistic about Hayden playing Darwin.    &amp;amp;#8364;&amp;amp;#339;We are very hopeful of Matthew Hayden being able to rejoin the team and our medical staff will continue to monitor him over the next two weeks,&amp;amp;#8364;&amp;amp;#157; Nielsen said.    Cricket Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris was more guarded.    He said Hayden was progressing well with his rehabilitation following an achilles tendon injury, but his availability was still to be determined.    Another veteran in skipper Ricky Ponting has already been ruled out of the series following wrist surgery, and the side will again be captained by Michael Clarke.    &amp;amp;#8364;&amp;amp;#339;While it is disappointing not to have Ricky Ponting available we are confident continuing his recovery and missing this series will assure Ricky is ready for the demanding cricket schedule ahead for the Australian team,&amp;amp;#8364;&amp;amp;#157; Hilditch said.
