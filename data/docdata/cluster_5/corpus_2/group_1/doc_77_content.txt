About broadcast issue if it is star cricket I am praying to Allah give sense to our cable providers to telecast. coz they have to do some works to do to telecast star cricket.      Go BD Go.                                          Don&amp;#039;t worry auntu bhai, if star cricket shows our cable operators will definitely give it, btw where do you live in Dhaka?
