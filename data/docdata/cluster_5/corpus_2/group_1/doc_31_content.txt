Star cricket is available but I don&amp;#039;t think they will show this series as they are too busy all the time showing India&amp;#039;s matches one after another. I think if there is any channel from which we can watch, then that would be super sports. They usually cover all the international matches that goes around the world, they also showed the whole series which we played against the kiwis in 2007-08. So, lets keep our fingers crossed as it is the only hope we have for this series.
