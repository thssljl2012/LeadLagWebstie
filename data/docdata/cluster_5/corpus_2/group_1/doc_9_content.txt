Flintoff has played many good innings against the moving ball, even at Edgbaston in the SA series he looked fairly good when the ball was moving around a bit got 30 odd before he ran everyone else out. He plays with a very straight bat, gets in good positions with his feet, has good balance and all of the shots in the book. All of his 3 100s in ODIs and even his 99 against India came in fairly difficult conditions when he was in very early in the game. His only technical issue is that he plays with hard hands and he tends to poke at deliveries outside of the off stump. But its not like hes incompetent against the moving ball as people seem to be making him out to be.                      Yes he does hard at it with his hands, also indecision in his footwork at times lets him down, thus he still goes through with his shots when he is in no position to play them.    To suggest he was in very early in those games, I disagree with. The earliest I think he came in was in the 17th over, and there is a stark contrast in facing first and second chanmge bowlers with a 17 over old ball as averse to facing the opening bowlers armed with a brand new one.

His best innings in ODIs have been when hes come in early. Hes always been a far better player when hes been allowed to settle in and then start to play his shots ala Edgbaston 2005 rather than when hes tried to hit from the go as he will undoubtedly be expected to do batting at no 6 or 7. Even if he is to perform a role similar to Mal Loye in the Commonwealth bank series, he would still be providing a bigger contribution to England than any other opener in the side possibly could.                      I agree that when he is form and during the period of scores you mentioned above, he quite clearly was, then it is important he has time to settle before unfurling his big shots.    Currently in one of the opening slots I think he would be a bit of a walking wicket. Better at this stage for there to be less expectation and in England&amp;#039;s ODI side, even at number 7 he&amp;#039;ll have chance to get set before beginning his assault.
