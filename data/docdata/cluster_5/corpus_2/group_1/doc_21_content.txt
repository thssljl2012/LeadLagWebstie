 Bangladesh is equivalent to a county league team and most of the players are just in their 19&amp;#039;s and 20&amp;#039;s. I think we expect too much from them. I&amp;#039;m sad not because of how these players playing now days but because the group which should have been playing for BD is missing. Most of those players were left out without guidance and nurturing. Some of them did not get selection so they went on to look for alternative as we all need to survive and others just living a ordinary life. There is a big gap and that gap is the reason why Bangladesh still not competitive.
