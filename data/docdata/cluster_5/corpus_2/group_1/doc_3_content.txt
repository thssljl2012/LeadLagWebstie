   Ah!  those days...        29 August, 2008    Aussies spurred by embarrassment       Andrew Wu, Sportal         Mashrafe Mortaza and Matthew Hayden  Getty Images / Cricket Australia        The ghosts from Australia&amp;#039;s shock loss to Bangladesh in 2005 will ensure the team will show no signs of complacency heading into Saturday&amp;#039;s first one-dayer in Darwin, stand-in captain Michael Clarke said.     The 2005 upset, which preceded Australia&amp;#039;s loss of the Ashes in England, still burns brightly in Clarke&amp;#039;s mind.     The loss was embarrassing not that it came against a minnow of international cricket, Clarke said, but because it was the result of the team taking the opposition for granted.     &amp;quot;I can guarantee you that definitely won&amp;#039;t happen (this time). It&amp;#039;s happened to us before and we&amp;#039;ve lost,&amp;quot; Clarke said.     &amp;quot;As soon as you take things for granted I think you find yourself asking questions why you&amp;#039;ve lost that game.&amp;quot;     At face value, there are several reasons why the Australians would take the three-match series with Bangladesh lightly.     The postponement of next month&amp;#039;s ICC Champions Trophy has left the side with no short-term goal following the Darwin series. Its next match after Darwin series won&amp;#039;t be until January.     The opponent is a minnow in Bangladesh, which has not beaten a Test-playing nation in one-day cricket since rolling India in the 2007 World Cup, and it&amp;#039;s still several months out from the start of the Australian summer.     But, Clarke said, the fierce competition for places in the absence of Ricky Ponting, Brett Lee and Matthew Hayden, combined with the privilege of playing international cricket ensured there would be no room for complacency.        &amp;quot;To me the aim of the game is to win. That&amp;#039;s our No.1 focus, then we can concentrate on India and whatever we have coming up after these three one-dayers,&amp;quot; he said.     &amp;quot;I think it&amp;#039;s important we do stay focused on the job at hand and that is to win these three one-dayers. It&amp;#039;s a good opportunity for guys to cement their spots in the team.&amp;quot;     &amp;quot;Unfortunately there&amp;#039;s only 11 spots. We&amp;#039;ve got 13 here, we&amp;#039;ve got guys injured at the moment.&amp;quot;     &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s a good opportunity for the guys to put their hand up and show they want to be part of the one-day team.&amp;quot;     Australia has not finalised its XI for Saturday&amp;#039;s match but coach Tim Nielsen told  cricket.com.au  that Stuart Clark, a Test regular but fringe player in the one-day side, was likely to play in all three games.     Nielsen also said all 13 players would get a run during the series.      Australia:  Michael Clarke (c), Michael Hussey (vc), Nathan Bracken, Stuart Clark, Brett Geeves, Brad Haddin, James Hopes, David Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Shaun Marsh, Andrew Symonds, Shane Watson, Cameron White.
