Virat Kohli.The middle order batsman brings a lot of energy and enthusiasm to the team&amp;amp;#039;s table and yet has a mature way of handling things. The U-19 captain led his team to victory in the recently concluded U-19 World Cup. Level-headed, Kohli revels in amassing runs in wholesale. He scored 235 runs in the tournament and his in-form batting is an advantage for the Bangalore team.      Now Rohit Sharma has suddenly become popular.He is playing well(!) in Commonwealth bank series.He has scored 139 runs in 5 matches with average of 46.33.The average looks quite good.But the way he played was horrible.In every innings,he &amp;amp;#039;played and missed&amp;amp;#039; several times, tried to follow the delieveries far outside the offstump, tried to go for huge hits at improper time and much more.Though he looked better than others (except Gautam Gambhir) he was not looking mature.He has got a good technique but he lacks patience.
