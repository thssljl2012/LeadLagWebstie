Isn&amp;#039;t he supposed to act as a motivator as well, or if he is not capable he should seek help of the professionals in that field. if you and me can see that deficiency why can&amp;#039;t he see? isn&amp;#039;t he being paid for seeing the deficiencies and take remedial measures?                                          Thats a very good point bhaiya,but it is true siddons does have some responsibilities ,he did let our players down right when he got the coaching job,but why do we play practice matches so well then? scoring 300+ against any opposition is good,the blame mostly goes to the players and then goes to siddons.
