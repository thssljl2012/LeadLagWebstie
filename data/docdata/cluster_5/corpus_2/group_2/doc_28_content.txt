I think we expect too much from them. I&amp;#039;m sad not because of how these players playing now days but because the group which should have been playing for BD is missing. Most of those players were left out without guidance and nurturing. Some of them did not get selection so they went on to look for alternative as we all need to survive and others just living a ordinary life. There is a big gap and that gap is the reason why Bangladesh still not competitive.                                          You are so right! Bangladesh and the West Indies have the worst domestic set up, and look where they are- No. 8 &amp;amp;amp; 9. At least the Windians are older compared to BD. Mentally these boys are not strong, also compared to other cricketers they are fairly short, and physically not very strong, they look like schoolboys on the field.   It is about time that BCB observe SL which is a tiny island, but has a very good domestic structure, the two best in the world are without a doubt Australia and England.   These young boys do not play enough cricket at the domestic level and are pushed too quickly into the national side. When they do not perform, their morale and self confidence go downhill, some are even dropped, there is no continuity. I feel so sad for them and I blame the coach and BCB.   Something has gone wrong since Siddons took over, they do not have the same passion anymore.
