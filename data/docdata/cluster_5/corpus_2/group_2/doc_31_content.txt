  We have to stay positive: Mortaza      TigerCricket.com  Report   01-September-2008        DARWIN: Bangladeshs pace spearhead Mashrafe Bin Mortaza is calling on the batsmen to come into their own in the second ODI of the Commonwealth Bank Series against Australia on Wednesday.       Bangladesh were humbled by 180 runs in Saturdays first match after getting dismissed for 74, their lowest ever total and Mortaza, the vice-captain thinks that was result of batsmen losing confidence at the wrong time.       I personally thought that two or three of our top-order batters did not look confident in that game. I am not giving excuses but the drop-in track was difficult for run-scoring and we did not look like working our way out of pressure at any time, said Mortaza after net practice on the centre wicket of the Marrara Oval today.       Mortaza however believed that the players had the talent to fare much better.       We have had a tough training session today. The centre wicket had a bit of grass and the batsmen were tested. What I have learnt in international cricket is that you have to go out there with a positive frame of mind and we have to do that on Wednesday. We have to be more than twice as good, play our natural game and get near 220 or 230. Thats the only way we can get over Saturdays poor show, said Mortaza.       On bowling Mortaza felt the new ball operators much compliment each other.       In the last game I was bowling tight from one end but Rajib (Shahadat Hossain) was leaking runs. Against Australia it is mighty important to bowl a high percentage of good balls. We had a chat with the AIS bowling coach Damien Fleming during our warm-ups and he also stressed on making scoring difficult and said that you win yourself a point with every dot ball you bowl against Australia.       Opening batsman Tamim Iqbal said there was no point looking back and the team had to move on.       We have lost Roqibul (Hassan) to a thumb injury but I guess we ought to look at that in a positive way also. It was destined to happen and we cant get him back. The others who are fit must lift themselves, said Tamim.       The occasion got to us in the first game but we are more relaxed now and hopefully we will play a better all-round game for the rest of the series, Tamim added.
