 Bangladesh batsman Roqibul Hassan has a fractured right thumb. He received the injury when he was struck on the gloves while getting out to pace bowler Brett Geeves during the Commonwealth Bank Series first ODI against Australia at the TIO Stadium on Saturday.    Roqibul was seen by a doctor on Saturday afternoon and had his X-ray done today (Sunday) morning. The X-ray has revealed a comminuted fracture. The batsman will be examined by an orthopedic surgeon tomorrow morning before a decision is made on his condition.       http://tigercricket.com/viewNews.aspx?newsID=570
