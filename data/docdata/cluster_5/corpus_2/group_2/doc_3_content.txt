I&amp;#039;ll stick with them a bit longer though, they&amp;#039;re just about the safest atm.                           I&amp;#039;ve been with Abbey for over 20 years, and I have no intention of moving. Considering they were able to take over part of B&amp;amp;amp;B&amp;#039;s operation, it shows they are pretty healthy - well Santander are anyway.                                                                                                          hmmmmmmm something        The ball&amp;#039;s rolling but the hamster&amp;#039;s dead.                                                                                                                     &amp;amp;nbsp;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Durgemeister&amp;#039;s Trophies              Durgemeister has no trophies.
