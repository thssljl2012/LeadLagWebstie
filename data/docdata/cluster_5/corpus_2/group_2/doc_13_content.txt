 i sincerly apologize to people for my overly enthusiastic attitude and praising of GOD too much... it seems like i should keep my excitement to my self :cry:      nonetheless, i am going through a very iffy-moment i tell myself stop following them i have far better things to do in life but i can&amp;#039;t help it...for two days i didn&amp;#039;t feel the courage to even log in...        i still think these guys are capable...seriously
