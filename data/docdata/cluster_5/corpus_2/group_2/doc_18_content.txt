 This is really very very unlucky, when a team is struggling in so other way and here comes the injury problem to make matter worse. We also currently don&amp;#039;t have any suitable replacement and I think by no means we can afford to have a rookie in the middle of the series against a team like Australia. I know Naeem would have been a good choice but playing in Australia in the middle of the series without any sort of practice and then again when the team is in such a bad shape is really a bit too much to ask for. Therefore a possible option would be to bring back Aftab and try him as a opening partner for Tamim but the question remains &amp;#039;&amp;#039;is he totally fit by now?&amp;quot;. If Aftab is also not available then we have no choice but to call our HaBa and make him play his last few ODI&amp;#039;s in the Australian soil.
