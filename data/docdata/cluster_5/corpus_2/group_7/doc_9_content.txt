England's batting was poor but nowhere near as diabolical as it's been painted in some places. That sort of thing happens from time to time and they're still perfectly capable of winning the series, and if they do it'll just be regarded as a blip. However, West Indies are also perfectly capable of winning the series and if they do that'll be far more of a downer on England than that one innings was. And yes, it's remarkable how similar the game was to the Sabina Test of 2004, I was thinking that midway through day-three. Shame I wasn't on CW to post "and I wonder if England will repeat West Indies' implosion on day-four", because I did think it. It'd have been regarded as prophetic, given the Greigy and Marsh-Lillee standards around here.      I wonder how much hand-wringing there's been from England fans and how much celebrating from Camps and Rose? CBA looking TBH.                      You thought about reading through that!?
