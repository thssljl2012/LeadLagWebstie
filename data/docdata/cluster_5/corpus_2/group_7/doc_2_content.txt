Back on the subject at hand, I think (and I could be entirely wrong in this belief) that Australian (&amp; South  African to a lesser extent) batsmen tend to leave far more balls alone than their English counterparts. I think growing up on truer, bouncier pitches has possibly made them more inclined to leave balls on length alone, regardless of line. Because our chaps play on sappier strips their instinct is more to defend because they're more often betrayed by variable bounce. Pietersen is a good leaver and obviously he learnt his cricket elsewhere.      The habits acquired in youth inform the man, so is it possible that chaps like Clarke are occasionally undone by changeable bounce because of this?                      Yeah, maybe. That could just be over-theorising though.      On the subject, batsmen get out a lot more often playing defensive shots to balls not hitting the stumps than they do leaving balls that are. So despite looking like a bit of a fool sometimes, maybe Michael Clarke with a test batting average of almost 50 has got the balance better than most.
