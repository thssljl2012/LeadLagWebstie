TBH I must admit I anticipated this move from him earlier itself (CBA to find the posts). Ever since 2007 WC, he's been struggling in ODIs and I thought he'd prefer test captaincy to a spot in ODIs and retire from ODIs altogether. However, I guess he's decided to give himself one more chance to excel in the ODIs, and gave upon test captaincy as well.    The move could backfire if he continues to struggle in ODIs and could be dropped.
