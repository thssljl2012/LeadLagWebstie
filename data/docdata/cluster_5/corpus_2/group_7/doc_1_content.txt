My thinking on most subjects largely untroubled by originality for a good few years now, anyway.      Back on the subject at hand, I think (and I could be entirely wrong in this belief) that Australian (&amp; South  African to a lesser extent) batsmen tend to leave far more balls alone than their English counterparts. I think growing up on truer, bouncier pitches has possibly made them more inclined to leave balls on length alone, regardless of line. Because our chaps play on sappier strips their instinct is more to defend because they're more often betrayed by variable bounce. Pietersen is a good leaver and obviously he learnt his cricket elsewhere.      The habits acquired in youth inform the man, so is it possible that chaps like Clarke are occasionally undone by changeable bounce because of this?
