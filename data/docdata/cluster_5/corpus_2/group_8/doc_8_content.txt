It doesn't work like that.      You have to subtract 11 from the total number of players used in the series and divide what's left by the number of tests after the first one to calculate the incremental number of players per test.      Has to be more fun than watching the action though.      EDIT   So 18 in 4 = 23 in 6.   fwiw
