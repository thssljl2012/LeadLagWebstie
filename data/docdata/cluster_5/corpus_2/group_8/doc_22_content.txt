  Aussie Pride! , International Cricket Captain:Ashes 2006 Edition  by Lonie_from_50           Commonwealth Bank Series - Australia vs India at Brisbane       16 January 2008   Cam White stars as Australia come back at Indians hard      Victorian all-rounder and newest Aussie spin specialist Cameron White has put his name out of reach of a last chance list, making a spectacular 61 not out off only 57 balls (only 42 balls to reach his half century), and then taking 3 wickets to play an all-rounders game. His strength with the bat down the order may see him batting too low, at number eight, but his performances with the ball have been classy, with a four wicket haul against Sri Lanka.    Australia started losing the wicket of the out of form Shane Watson in the first over, but a massive partnership between Adam Gilchrist and Ricky Ponting set the tone. Gilchrist made his 50 off 46 balls, and cruised to 86 (again) at an incredible strike. Ponting though went one better, reaching the next milestone, and just as quick as his partner. White helped finish the innings in style.    Chasing 312, India started well, losing 2 wickets early but applying the pressure in the power plays. The little master provided great shots to soon be in the nineties, but Ben Hilfenhaus claimed him for 96, before taking 2 more wickets, to have three along with Cameron White.
