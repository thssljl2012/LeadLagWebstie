  FAZ/KCM Super Division side Nchanga Rangers yesterday handed head coach Kenneth Malitoli and his deputy Sileni Phiri a three- match ultimatum.Rangers vice-chairman Jim Chongo said the decision was made at an executive meeting on Thursday following the team's recent poor results.He said Malitoli and Phiri must win three games starting with today's Barclays Cup pre-quarterfinal match against Lusaka Dynamos at Railway Grounds in Kabwe.'We have given our two coaches a three game ultimatum starting from this Saturday because the performance of the team has been very bad,' Chongo said.He wondered why the team was not producing good results when all the players the coach wanted were available.'We are worried because the team is not getting good results when we bought all the players who were identified by the coach and he Malitoli assured us that the team will be getting good results,' Chongo said.He said from the last five games played, Rangers have won one, drawn three and lost one.Chongo added that the poor performance of the team was a source of worry to club sponsors Konkola Copper Mines and other stakeholders.'As a club, we have to win so that we make our sponsors happy,' he said.Chongo said assistant coach Levy 'Chabby' Chabala was still on leave.He, however, urged the players to pull up their socks.'We are even going to talk to the players because this is employment which they are paid for, they are paid their salaries and winning bonuses,' Chongo said.He said if some of the players do not improve, they should not be surprised to find out that they are no longer part of the team.Rangers is eighth on the league table with 29 points while Zesco United is on top of the table with 38 points.
