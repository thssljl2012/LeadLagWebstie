REUTERS/Andy Clark (GRENADA) Picture Supplied by Action Images  Michael Clarke and Nathan Bracken return from injury to take their places in Australia's squad to face South Africa in the final One Day International in Perth on Friday (January 30th) and New Zealand (February 1st) at the same venue.  Clarke missed the first four matches of the series with a thumb injury while Bracken missed the match in Adelaide with a calf strain. Australia lost that match by eight wickets to cede the series with a match still to play.  Michael Clarke returns from the thumb injury which has kept him out of the past three Commonwealth Bank Series matches in Hobart, Sydney and Melbourne,' National Selection Panel chairman Andrew Hilditch said. 'While it is unfortunate that Nathan Hauritz has been omitted after limited opportunities, it is unlikely that we would play a specialist spinner in Perth and therefore it has been decided he will return to New South Wales where he will be available for selection for the Weet-Bix Sheffield Shield match in Newcastle.  Nathan Bracken has recovered from the calf injury which ruled him out of last nights clash and therefore returns while Ryan Harris has been omitted from the squad which has been selected for the two games in Perth.
