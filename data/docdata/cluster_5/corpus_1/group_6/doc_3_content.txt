Embattled opener Matthew Hayden was on Thursday left out of Australia's 13-man squads for the upcoming Twenty20 Internationals and Commonwealth Bank ODI Series against South Africa even as speculation continues on his Test future.    National Selection Panel Chairman Andrew Hilditch made it clear the teams were chosen with an eye on the Twenty20 World Cup later this year and 2011 ODI World Cup while hinting he could not see Hayden playing a role in the two major events.    'The announcement of these squads for the KFC Twenty20 Internationals and the Commonwealth Bank Series is a clear indication we are now in full-scale planning for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2011 ICC World Cup,' Hilditch said.
