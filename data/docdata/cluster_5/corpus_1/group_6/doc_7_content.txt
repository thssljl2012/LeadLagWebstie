DAVID Warner will make his one-day international debut on Sunday against South Africa in Hobart after being called into the squad to replace the rested Michael Clarke.  Vice-captain Clarke encountered pain in his injured thumb during Friday's loss to South Africa and will rest in for two weeks in an attempt to play in the one-day against New Zealand.  When Michael arrived in Melbourne on Wednesday, it was evident that after one week's rest the pain in his thumb had decreased enough for him to bat at training the following day,' Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said on Saturday.  However during last nights match, he experienced pain while batting. It was the first time that he had batted without an injection since suffering the injury during the Test match at the WACA Ground.  While Michael could continue to play with pain-relieving injections, this will ultimately slow his recovery. As a result, it was decided that he will now rest for two weeks, after which point he will be reviewed by Cricket Australia medical staff with the plan for him to be available for the Commonwealth Bank Series against New Zealand.  With an important Test series against South Africa starting in four weeks, this is the best course of action.'  Warner now gets another chance to impress after smashing 89 off 43 balls on debut for Australia in the Twenty20 victory over South Africa at the MCG.  The 22-year-old is yet to play a first class match for NSW but former players have been calling for the youngster's inclusion since his exciting Twenty20 display. Warner will now miss Saturday's Twenty20 Big Bash game against Victoria.  This is obviously very disappointing for Michael and his presence will be sorely missed,' chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said.  'However it presents an exciting opportunity for David Warner to follow his spectacular Twenty20 debut in the 50-over format for Australia.'
