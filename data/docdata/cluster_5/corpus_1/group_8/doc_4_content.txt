The Commonwealth Bank Southern Stars are on the eve of their World Cup title defence, as day one of the ICC Women's World Cup got underway today.  Day one of the Cup got underway in the ACT and NSW, with India making light work of Pakistan at Bradman Oval in Bowral and England cruising to a comfortable 100-run win over Sri Lanka at Manuka Oval in Canberra.  It was all one-way traffic in Bowral with India's quicks rattling out Pakistan for just 54, then hastily picking off the runs required before the scheduled lunch break.  Speedster Rumeli Dhar was the pick of the bowlers with 3-7 off eight overs.  Only Sana Mir (17) and Nain Abidi (11) reached double figures, as Pakistan crumbled out in 29 Overs.  In reply, India reached the total in 10 overs with out losing a wicket.  A ton from Claire Taylor was the highlight of the day for England in their comfortable 100-run over Sri Lanka.  Batting first the English women compiled 5-277 with Caroline Aitkins also making 50 in a support act to Taylor.  It was always going to be a tough chase for Sri Lanka who struggled to 7-177 from their 50 overs with Suwini de Alwis top scoring with 37.  Laura Marsh was the standout bowler snaring 3-31 from her 10 overs.  Meanwhile, the Commonwealth Bank Southern Stars get their World Cup title defence underway tomorrow in a blockbuster opening match against New Zealand at North Sydney Oval.  The two sides, along with England are the most fancied teams to take home the silverware come the final on 22 March and Rolton and her side will be looking for a positive start tomorrow.  The two teams battled out a 2-2 draw for the Rose Bowl Trophy in New Zealand before Australia won a Twenty20 match at the SCG last month.  Tomorrow's match at North Sydney Oval will be broadcast live on FOX SPORTS. Tickets are available, starting at $5.  FOX SPORTS will also show a further three group matches plus all finals matches.
