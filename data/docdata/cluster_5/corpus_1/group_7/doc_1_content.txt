Aussies planning to curb Morkel's savage assault  Zeecric Bureau  Adelaide, Jan 24: Reeling under the Morkel effect, which saw his team suffer 2 losses in 3 of the closely fought encounters in the ongoing Commonwealth Bank Series so far, skipper Ricky Ponting assured that Australia have plans to shut down South African smashing machine.  'If you bowl balls in certain areas he can't hit them over the fence and we saw that in Hobart and the way Bracks (Nathan Bracken) bowled to him in Hobart was perfect,' he said.  'With guys that are as big and powerful and as strong as him you only have to be out by a couple of inches and it is the difference between a yorker and the ball sailing back into the grandstands.  'It is a fine line for the bowler.'  Batting at the number 8 position, Morkels savage assaults late in the innings have put the Proteas on the brink of a one-day series victory over Australia ahead of game four of the five-match series in Adelaide on Australia Day.  The left-hander has butchered hosts for 91 runs in just 45 balls, and has twice proved to be the decisive factor.  'Maybe if a high ball goes up next time when Morkel is next in, maybe we will let it bounce and get on with things,' he said on a lighter note.  Meanwhile, South African skipper Johan Botha said that though he did flirt briefly with the idea of promoting Morkel up the order coach Mickey Arthur didnt agree.  Morkel also said that he was content with his role in the batting order.  'That is where I am training to play at eight, it is perfect to have guys down the order who can hit the ball out of the park in the powerplay that puts pressure on the fielding team,' he said.  Hard-hitting Australian opener David Warner was another suitably impressed with Morkel's striking of the ball.  'I would hate to be that ball, he can seriously hit a ball,' he said.  'One of those players that can take the game away from you.'
