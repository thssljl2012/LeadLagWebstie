New Zealand has won the toss and elected to bat in the fourth Commonwealth Bank Series match at Adelaide Oval on Tuesday.  Wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum hurt his shoulder during game three but has been cleared to play while Craig Cumming has been brought into the side to strengthen the tourists' batting line-up.  Cumming replaces Jeetan Patel.  Australia has named an unchanged side.  New Zealand leads 2-1 and can clinch the one-day series with a victory in game four.  The Australian players will donate their match fees - a total of more than $67,000 - to the Commonwealth Bank Series Bushfire Appeal.  This will add to the $1 million from the Commonwealth Bank, $100,000 from Cricket Australia and $25,000 from the South Australian Cricket Association.  The Commonwealth Bank has also confirmed it will donate $100 for every run scored in the match and $1000 for every six hit.  As well as donating the match fee, the players shirts from the match in Adelaide will be signed and auctioned off with monies raised going to the cause.  Funds raised from the Appeal will all go to the 2009 Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund, a fund set-up by the Victorian Government, in partnership with the Australian Government and the Red Cross, to support communities affected by the fires.  New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori said at the toss his side would also be making a financial contribution to the appeal.  Australia: Ricky Ponting (captain), Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin, David Hussey, Michael Hussey, Cameron White, Callum Ferguson, James Hopes, Mitchell Johnson, Nathan Bracken, Ben Hilfenhaus, David Warner (12th man)  New Zealand: Daniel Vettori (captain), Brendon McCullum, Martin Guptill, Craig Cumming, Peter Fulton, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliot, Neil Broom, Kyle Mills, Tim Southee, Iain O'Brien, Jeetan Patel (12th man)
