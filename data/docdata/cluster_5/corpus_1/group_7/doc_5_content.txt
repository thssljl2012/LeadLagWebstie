ADELAIDE- New Zealand's cricketers showed their sympathy for the victims of the devastating Victorian bushfires, donning black armbands, observing a minute's silence and making a financial donation.  Both teams lined up in front of the Adelaide Oval grandstand and bowed their heads in a mark of respect just before the fourth Chappell-Hadlee Trophy one-day international today.  New Zealand's players agreed at a team meeting yesterday to donate a proportion of their match fees to the bushfire relief fund, while New Zealand Cricket (NZC) also announced it was making a donation. NZC declined to reveal the total amount. 'It's not something we're that familiar with over in New Zealand but it's something that we have a lot of sympathy for,' New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori told Channel Nine. 'Our deepest condolences go out to everyone affected. Hopefully the small part we can play through NZC and our own contributions can help in some way.' The New Zealand players also agreed to each donate a signed series shirt to be auctioned, with the proceeds going to the bushfire appeal.  Australian players announced they would donate all of the team's match fees - about A$67,000 ($85,765) - from today's match, as well as holding an auction of signed playing shirts after Friday's series-ending match in Brisbane.  Cricket Australia would also contribute A$100,000, while the one-day series' major sponsor Commonwealth Bank committed A$1 million upfront, as well as A$100 for every run scored today and A$1000 for every six.  The South Australian Cricket Association committed to donating all ticket sales proceeds from today's match, along with a cash donation of $25,000. - NZPA
