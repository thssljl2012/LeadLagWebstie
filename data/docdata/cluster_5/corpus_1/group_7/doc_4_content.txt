Australian Callum Ferguson will have his first chance to wear the green and gold in front of his home crowd on Tuesday.  Fergusson is in the side for the fourth ODI against New Zealand at Adelaide Oval on Tuesday.  Ferguson has displayed some promising signs in his opening games with the national team and will be the first Redbacks batsman in several seasons to play a one-day international in South Australia.  'Fantastic feeling to play at elite level'  The classy right-hander said it was a 'fantastic' feeling to be playing at the elite level and was looking forward to competing in familiar surroundings.  'This will be pretty close to the ultimate I think, playing for your country in front of your home crowd - probably only topped by wearing the baggy green (playing Test cricket) and doing it,' he said.  'I've thoroughly enjoyed being around and obviously having played with and against most of the guys in the team previously probably helps a little bit. The first couple of games are the ones I'll cherish for the rest of my life,' he added.  Fergusson trying to remain relaxed  The 24-year-old said he had tried to remain relaxed heading into the Commonwealth Bank Series games.  'It's not that easy to do but it does help when you've got guys with experience at the other end. In my first game I had Cameron (White) out there at the start and he helped calm the nerves a little bit,' he said.  'He told me to get it back to basics and just enjoy the situation and then Mike Hussey yesterday afternoon was fantastic to bat with as well,' he added.  Australia keen to repeat Sydney performance  Ferguson said his team-mates were keen to repeat the performance they delivered in Sydney yesterday and square up the series to set up a decider at the Gabba.  'If we can get off to a good start tomorrow afternoon and get the ball rolling again and keep the momentum going from last night then that would be fantastic and go along towards getting us the victory we are looking for,' he said.
