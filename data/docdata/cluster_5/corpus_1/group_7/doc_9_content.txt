Persistent rain has delayed the start of play in the Commonwealth Bank Series decider between Australia and New Zealand at the Gabba.  The steady downpour is expected to clear by late afternoon opening the door for a Twenty20 style fixture, but any hope of a 50-over-per side match has disappeared.  Australia levelled the five-match series at two apiece with a six-wicket victory in  Adelaide on Monday to set up a winner-takes-all showdown.  Australian vice captain Michael Clarke has been named in the 12 after overcoming a back complaint, while the Black Caps also look likely to take an unchanged line-up into the decider.  Australia:  Bracken, Clarke, Ferguson, Haddin, Hilfenhaus, Hopes, D.Hussey, M.Hussey, Johnson, Ponting, Siddle, White  New Zealand:  Broom, Cumming, Elliott, Fulton, Guptill, McCullum, Mills, O'Brien, Patel, Southee, Taylor, Vettori
