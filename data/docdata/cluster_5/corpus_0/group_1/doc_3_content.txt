S Badrinath, the Tamil Nadu batsman, will be his replacement. &amp;amp;quot;I spoke to Sachin and the team physio [Nitin Patel] this morning and I can confirm that Tendulkar has been ruled out of action for two to three weeks,&amp;amp;quot; Ratnakar Shetty, the BCCI&amp;amp;#39;s chief administrative officer, told Cricinfo. Tendulkar had jarred his elbow while attempting a catch in the 47th over of Sri Lanka&amp;amp;#39;s first innings on Saturday, and was quickly taken off. An MRI scan revealed a swelling, and Tendulkar didn&amp;amp;#39;t take the field for the rest of the innings. However, he did bat in India&amp;amp;#39;s second innings on Sunday, though two places below his customary No. 4 position. Tendulkar was out for 14, which still leaves him 77 short of surpassing Brian Lara as the leading run-getter in Tests. After missing the Asia Cup in Pakistan due to a groin injury, Tendulkar had been named in the ODI squad for Sri Lanka as well as the Champions Trophy in Pakistan which takes place in September. His last one-day match was the second final of the Commonwealth Bank Series against Australia in Brisbane in March 2008. Badrinath confirmed his call-up to the national team, and will leave for Sri Lanka on Wednesday. &amp;amp;quot;Yes, I got a call to join the team for the Sri Lanka series and I&amp;amp;#39;m leaving day after,&amp;amp;quot; he told Cricinfo. The five-match series will be played from August 18-29.
