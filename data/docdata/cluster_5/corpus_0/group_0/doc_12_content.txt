 Spinner Ajantha Mendis claimed six wickets to lead Sri Lanka to a 100-run victory over India in the final of the Asia Cup on Sunday.Mendis (six for 13 from eight overs), who was brought on as early as the 10th over after Virender Sehwag (60) threatened to make quick work of Sri Lanka's target of 273, struck twice in his first over and then picked up four more wickets to help his side bowl out India for 173.Sanath Jayasuriya had cracked a blistering 125 and put on 131 runs for the fifth wicket with Tillakaratne Dilshan (56) to help Sri Lanka to 273, a target which had seemed inadequate on a placid pitch.India lost Gautam Gambhir (six) but the runs flowed as Sehwag and Suresh Raina (16) took up the chase.Mendis, however, turned the game around.He first had Sehwag sent back, although the batsman plotted his own downfall by stepping out to hit the bowler over the top and was beaten by the flight and stumped by wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara.Mendis then bowled Yuvraj Singh for a duck and collected the wickets of Raina and Rohit Sharma in his third over to leave India devastated.India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (49) attempted to rebuild the innings in the company of Robin Uthappa (20), but the latter's dismissal triggered another collapse.Doni had raised eyebrows by asking the defending champions to bat first, a decision which seemed even more surprising as India named only four specialist bowlers in the final 11.But that decision was vindicated when Ishant Sharma (three for 52) produced a fiery opening spell to leave Sri Lanka teetering on 66 for four.Jayasuriya bailed Sir Lanka out of trouble though, his 27th one-day century coming off just 79 deliveries.He was dropped on 56 by RP Singh, the fielder making a mess of a lofted short-arm pull. RP Singh bore the brunt of that error as he was hit for 26 runs by Jayasuriya off the next over sent down by the left-arm bowler.Jayasuriya finally fell to part-time spinner Sehwag, his 114-delivery vigil punctuated with nine boundaries and five sixes.This is Sri Lanka's fourth Asia Cup title, adding to title triumphs in 1986, 1997 and 2004.
