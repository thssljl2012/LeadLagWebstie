In a boldly surprising move that made me almost want to go check the revised CBA to see if the rule had been changed, goaltender Roberto Luongo has been named captain of the 08-09 Vancouver Canucks. However, the C will not be on his jersey.  Seeing that the 'Nucks have gone out on a limb and set a modern precedent for goalies to be captains, I hereby nominate Johan "Moose" Hedberg as the captain
