    Here are the two current bestseller lists. CBA's October list reflects sales in August. ECPA's October list would normally reflect sales in September, but since it was put up early (as they did last month), I'm guessing they "rounded the corner" on a month again--perhaps using two weeks of August data and two weeks of September data. (Michael--if I'm wrong, please advise.) Titles on one list and not the other are highlighted in blue. These lists look really different, so perhaps ECPA has used more data from September than August, such as first three weeks of September and last week of August. At any rate--congrats to the folks on one list or another, regardless of when your sales were made.CBA (Numbers in paratheses indicate placement on the CBA Top 50 List)1 (1) The Shack ,William P.
