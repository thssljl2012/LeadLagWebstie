LONDON -- Oil rose more than US$2 to over US$109 a barrel on Wednesday as concerns about U.S. fuel supply outweighed anxiety about the U.S. government's US$700 billion plan to rescue the finance industry.U.S. crude traded up US$2.42 to US$109.03 a barrel by 1122 GMT, while London Brent crude gained US$2.42 to trade at US$105.50 a barrel.Weekly U.S. government inventory data due later on Wednesday is expected to show that crude stocks fell by 2 million barrels -- the fifth consecutive week of declines -- due to disruptions caused by Hurricane Ike, according to a Reuters poll. 'There could be some improved sentiment but I suspect people are largely being cautious ahead of the release of the EIA data and don't want to be caught short,' said David Moore, a commodities analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.Energy firms continued to work to restart production, refineries and pipelines after Ike battered U.S. oil infrastructure earlier this month. Six oil refineries in Texas remained shut on Tuesday due to the hurricane.The disruptions have also drawn down fuel stockpiles, with analysts forecasting data will show a 1.5 million barrel drop in distillate stocks. Gasoline stocks are expected to have dropped by 4 million barrels as Hurricane Ike forced the shut-down of Gulf Coast refineries.Additional support came as tanker tracker Petrologistics said OPEC oil supply fell by 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) in September due to lower output from members including Saudi Arabia and Iran.The estimate indicates OPEC was starting to cut back supplies even before it agreed on Sept. 10 to trim output to official targets to prop up prices.
