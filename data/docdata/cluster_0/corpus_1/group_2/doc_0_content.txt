The dollar fell against the euro on Wednesday as the foreign exchange market absorbed a move by the US Federal Reserve to rescue insurance giant AIG, dealers said.The European single currency rose to 1.4226 dollars, from 1.4127 late in New York on Tuesday.Against the Japanese currency, the greenback firmed to 105.73, up from 105.62 yen.The dollar won limited support after the US Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates on Tuesday at 2.0 percent, despite recent market turmoil, in a move seen as a sign of confidence in a recovery.But the dollar lost some momentum after the Bank of Japan unanimously decided to keep interest rates at a low 0.50 percent in line with earlier expectations.'This time the Fed did not follow the market's call to cut rates; right up to the meeting the market firmly expected the Fed to lower rates,' said Commerzbank analyst Antje Praefcke.'The disappointment about the Fed not cutting the rates was compensated by the decision to bail out AIG.'The US government and the Fed refused to push state money into the biggest American insurance company until yesterday (Tuesday) evening. But in the end they had no choice. AIG was simply too big to fail.'The Fed announced an 85-billion-dollar rescue loan to save American International Group (AIG) from bankruptcy amid fears of a catastrophic effect on financial markets.In an unprecedented intervention into private business, the US central bank agreed that the government will get an equity stake of 79.9 percent in the insurer.However, investors' risk appetite remained fragile amid volatile trade and the dollar could lose steam against other currencies, dealers said.Calyon analysts also warned: 'The situation remains very volatile and we certainly wouldn't suggest this will mark a sustained easing in risk aversion, but more likely some much-needed respite before pressure resumes.'Worries continued to pervade markets as the US housing market remains in a slump due to the subprime crisis over loans to high-risk customers, dealers said.In early London trading on Wednesday, the euro changed hands at 1.4226 dollars against 1.4127 late Tuesday, at 150.02 yen (149.27), 0.7972 pounds (0.7921) and 1.5915 Swiss francs (1.5008).The dollar stood at 105.73 yen (105.62) and 1.1199 Swiss francs (1.1223).The pound was at 1.7851 dollars (1.7840).On the London Bullion Market, the price of gold rose to 785.25 dollars per ounce from 779.50 dollars late on Tuesday.
