Even the likely bail-out of the US financial sector failed to boost shares, with investors and analysts wary until the rescue is finally passed by lawmakers.HSBC, unchanged at 879p, was the only bank left unscathed as its well-capitalised position drew fresh praise from Collins Stewart.Fears over second half trading caused shares to fall 16% or 60.5p to 318p, despite strong first half volumes on the back of high levels of volatility in financial markets.Tour operator Thomas Cook was one of just a handful of risers, up 5% or 10p to 212.75p after posting a strong trading update. TUI Travel fared less well, falling 4p to 217p, despite echoing the positive comments of its rival.But the latest worries for the financial sector dealt another blow for housebuilding shares, with Taylor Wimpey down 5.75p at 37.25p and Barratt Developments 10p lower at 111.5p.
