The U.S. dollar remained under pressure Thursday but was off its session lows against most major rivals after the Federal Reserve and other central banks announced a coordinated effort to boost liquidity in severely distressed short-term credit markets.The dollar index , which measures the U.S. unit against a basket of six major currencies, stood at 78.030, down from 78.158 in late North American trading Wednesday. Earlier Thursday it fell as low as 77.260.Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was buying 104.84, up from 104.44 in late trade Wednesday. Against the dollar, the euro stood at $1.4372, down from a high of $1.4539 but still above $1.4329 late Wednesday. The Fed said it was providing an additional $180 billion in dollars through new and existing swap lines to other central banks, including the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. The funds can be used in overnight loans and other short-term lending programs in an effort to alleviate a massive credit crunch that materialized this week in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and mounting fears about the financial sector.

The dollar has managed to hold up relatively well this week despite an onslaught of bad news about the U.S. economy and the financial sector, said Kenneth Broux, an analyst at Lloyds TSB, and appears to be boosted by a 'a repatriation of investment flows back into the U.S and certainly from emerging markets.'The need to fund the U.S. government's bailout of financial institutions should also be positive for the dollar in the near term, Broux said.Sales data lift poundThe British pound traded at $1.8156, up from $1.8140 late Wednesday, boosted by an unexpected jump in August U.K. retail sales. British retailers saw a 1.2% monthly rise in sales volume in August and a 3.3% annual increase, the Office for National Statistics reported. Expectations were for a 0.5% monthly drop and an annual rise of 1.5%, according to a Dow Jones Newswires survey of analysts. The largest contribution to growth came from textile, clothing and footwear stores, where sales saw a monthly rise of 4.1%, and an annual rise of 8.8%. Monthly retail data tends to be volatile, however, noted Chiara Corsa, economist at UniCredit.Third-quarter sales still appear on track to slip from the second quarter's surprisingly strong levels, Corsa wrote in a research note.The resilience of the retail sector 'was one of the major factors preventing a more pronounced decline in private spending' in the second quarter, the economist said. 'As this support will fade in [the third quarter], we see another outright contraction in consumption -- though likely less pronounced than we thought.'
