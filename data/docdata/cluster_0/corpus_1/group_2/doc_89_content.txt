The share market was lower at noon after Wall Street fell on the back of growing doubts over the effectiveness of the US governments proposed bailout of the financial sector.Locally it wasnt a sea of red though, with relief supplied by each of the gold, energy, telecommunications and utilities sectors.At 1200 AEST (10am WST), the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 was down 95.1 points, or 1.89 per cent, to 4925.4, while the broader All Ordinaries lost 89.3 points, or 1.77 per cent, to 4,960.8.The Sydney Futures Exchanges December Share Price Index (SPI) contract was off 52 points to 4979, on volume of 19,405 contracts.Financials were hit yet again, but it was the Australian real estate investment trust (A-REIT) and healthcare sectors which were the key underperformers.In commercial banking, Commonwealth Bank of Australia lost 46 cents, or 1.03 per cent, to $44.14, while Westpac Banking Corporation was off 53 cents, or 2.15 per cent to $24.17.National Australia Bank gave up 60 cents, or 2.47 per cent, to $23.70, while Australia and New Zealand Banking Group - which now isnt too far behind NAB in the capitalisation stakes - shed 75 cents, or 3.92 per cent, to $18.40.Westpac takeover target St George Bank shed 20 cents to $31.29, while Bank of Queensland was the worst laggard, losing 85 cents, or 5.72 per cent to $14.01.BHP Billiton traders didnt like it though, with the stock losing $1.10, or 2.8 per cent to $38.60, while takeover target Rio Tinto was whittled away by $1.65, or 1.49 per cent to $109.35.Volatility continues to reign supreme.At 1213 AEST (10.13 WST), GPT Group was off 17 cents, or 8.25 per cent to $1.89, while Stockland Group had dropped 64 cents, or 10.11 per cent to $5.69.Westfield Group shed 92 cents, or 4.89 per cent to $17.88, while Mirvac Group dipped six cents, or 1.97 per cent to $2.99.Centro Properties Group was steady at 8.2 cents, as was Centro Retail Group at 12 cents.IG Markets dealer Ranjin Singh said market volatility was extraordinary, and that for longer-term investors it was less than ideal that markets and stocks alike were moving with wide daily margins.Its been an incredible couple of days, and very unusual week or two, Mr Singh said.Massive events in the US markets compressed into a very short timeframe, so the level of volatility that were seeing right now is at extraordinarily high levels.(They are) not very favourable conditions to invest.
