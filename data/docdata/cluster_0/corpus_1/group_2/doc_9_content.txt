NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- The sky seemed to be holding up for most of Monday's session, even as the credit crisis claimed two of Wall Street's most renowned investment firms, but fresh worries about insurance-giant AIG led investors to scramble for the exits and turn to the Federal Reserve's meeting on interest rates Tuesday. 'I can't forecast what tomorrow brings at this point,' said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services. 'But we've got another big day tomorrow with the Fed meeting.' The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($INDU:$INDUNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) plunged 504.48 points, or 4.4%, to end at 10,917.51. Blue chips posted their worst one-day point drop since Sept. 17, 2001and its worst percentage drop since July 19, 2002. The S&amp;amp;P 500 index ($SPX:$SPXNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) , which market professionals consider as a broader and more accurate gauge of the market, fell 59 points, or 4.7%, to 1,192. The broad index fell below the 1,200 mark, its worst level of the year, which it briefly hit on July 15. 'I didn't like the close,' Mendelsohn said. '[The market] was behaving really nicely all day long but then the close took out critical lows for the S&amp;amp;P 500. That leaves us in a very dangerous position.' In an unprecedented reshaping of the Wall Street landscape, Lehman Brothers (LEH:LEHNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) declared bankruptcy over the weekend and Merrill Lynch (MER:MERNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) sold itself to Bank of America (BAC:BACNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) . Following the news, global markets had sold off while Wall Street had held up relatively well, with the Dow falling between 200 and 300 points -- for most of the session. But the selling pressure resumed in the final hour of trading as worries about the fate of insurance-giant American International Group (AIG:AIGNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) saw its stock lose more than 60% of its value. 'If AIG is not resolved in the morning, then where do we stop this?' Mendelsohn said. 'The assets they would have to shed are mind-boggling. We can't let this thing fail. They take everything with it.' Fed to the rescue? After the events, market odds that the Fed will cut interest rates at Tuesday's meeting jumped. Rate cuts historically tend to boost the stock market, even if only temporarily.  'There's' a good possibility that there will be one,' said Roberts at ChannelCapitalResearch.com. 'But there could be other things [in the Fed statement], such as a mechanism to defuse the landmines out there. Otherwise, we'll continue to shift from panic every time we hit a landmine to euphoria when there's a resolution.' The market, he said, won't escape the current crisis the usual way, where 'a crescendo' of problems eventually reaches an apex of fear that leads the market to sell-off and is followed by a rebound. 'I think instead we'll stay in this period of long-term malaise,' Roberts said. A clearing out process Ever since the collapse of the housing market revealed bad home loans were held by financial institutions worldwide, the hunt was on to find out how far the damage would extend on Wall Street. The year-long bad-home loans crisis first led investment firm Bear Stearns near collapse in March before the Federal Reserve forced it into a deal with J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM:JPMNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) . Earlier this month, government-sponsored mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNM:FNMNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) and Freddie Mac (FRE:FRENews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) were fully taken over by the government in order to bring down mortgage rates.
