SYDNEY, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 4.3 percent on Tuesday, joining other regional markets in a sell-off after U.S. lawmakers rejected a bailout package for the troubled financial sector.Investors dumped miners such as BHP Billiton Ltd (ASX: BHP.ax) and Rio Tinto Ltd (ASX: RIO.ax) on concerns the crisis would slow global growth and cut back demand for metals. 'The more Congress delays the rescue package, basically the bigger impact it's going to have on the real economy and global growth,' said Sean Fenton, a fund manager with Tribeca Investment Partners, which oversees about A$600 million ($480 million). The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index .AXJO dropped 206.9 points to 4,600.5, according to the latest available figures, the lowest close since December 2005. It had fallen as much as 5.5 percent early in the session. The index logged its biggest monthly fall since January 2008.New Zealand's benchmark NZX-50 index .NZ50 ended down 98.3 points, or 3.1 percent, at 3,090.2.Some investors were still hopeful that the U.S. bailout would find support with some modifications, but they warned any rescue would only help the market in the short-term. 'Even if this package is passed, the market might bounce in the short-term. People are now focusing on the realities of a recession and more bank failures,' said Tom Elliott, a fund manager with MM&amp;amp;E Capital. Banks led the market down on concerns the worsening credit crisis would further push up funding costs, slow demand for loans and increase bad debts.National Australia Bank Ltd (ASX: NAB.ax) , which has made the highest writedowns linked to the credit crisis among Australian banks, fell 5.6 percent to A$24.26, while Westpac Banking Corp (ASX: WBC.ax) lost 7.2 percent to A$21.48. BHP Billiton, the world's top miner, fell 9.5 percent to A$31.00 and its takeover target, Rio Tinto, lost 11.5 percent to A$84.50. Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd (ASX: HVN.ax) , an electrical goods and furniture retailer, dropped 11.7 percent to A$3.09, its biggest one-day percentage fall in about eight years, after forecasting an 18 percent profit drop for the two months to Aug. 31 due to losses at its Irish operations [nSYD155369].Among the few gainers, Caltex Australia Ltd (ASX: CTX.ax) , the nation's only listed refiner, rose 1.3 percent to A$12.35 on optimism that its operating margin would get a boost from falling crude prices.
