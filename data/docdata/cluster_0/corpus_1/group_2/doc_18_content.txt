A rally on Asian stock markets triggered by a massive US rescue plan for insurance giant American International Group (AIG) lost steam Wednesday as worries crept back over the US financial crisis, brokers said.Asian markets opened to learn that the US Federal Reserve would extend an 85-billion-dollar loan to the AIG , news which staved off another round of bloodletting overnight on Wall Street.The markets gained on early trade, making up for Tuesday's dramatic selloff after the collapse of US investment titan Lehman Brothers.But the rally failed to keep momentum and some bourses turned lower in the afternoon amid lingering worries over the health of US financial institutions.Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei-225 index closed up 1.21 percent, trimming gains from the morning. One day earlier, the Nikkei had plunged nearly five percent to a more than three-year low.Hong Kong shares were down 1.85 percent and Shanghai lost 2.33 percent on unabated concerns over the impact of the US financial turmoil on the Chinese economy.The region's central banks once again pumped cash into the money markets to ensure investors had enough money, with the Bank of Japan injecting some three trillion yen (28 billion US dollars).The Federal Reserve plan, under which the US government will take a nearly 80 percent stake in AIG, marks an unprecedented intervention by the US central bank into a private business.The intervention is being considered as 'the first step towards financial stabilisation,' said Masatoshi Sato, broker at Mizuho Investors Securities in Tokyo.But Sato cautioned that the market was confused about what guidelines US authorities are following in dealing with troubled financial institutions .The Federal Reserve had intervened in rescuing investment firm Bear Stearns earlier this year and now is lending support to AIG -- but it allowed Lehman Brothers to collapse. 'The principles of US financial authorities are still unclear,' Sato said. 'Risks linger and the market will likely be unstable for a while.' Kazuhiro Takahashi, equity head at Daiwa Securities SMBC in Tokyo, said the markets were 'running out of steam' after cheering the AIG rescue plan.He said market players were concerned about other troubled financial firms. 'Uncertainties over the global economy also remain unchanged. We want to see a Wall Street reaction tonight,' he said. Seoul finished 2.7 percent higher after Tuesday's 6.1 percent plunge.Philippine share prices closed up 1.5 percent as investors picked up local stocks after an 11 percent slide over the past six days.
