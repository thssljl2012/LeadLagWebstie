United Kingdom -  * Copper gains after U.S. announces risky assets plan* Copper inventories at 19-month highs raise demand worries* U.S. debt plan does little to alleviate bearish mood(Adds fresh comments, updates prices)LONDON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Copper jumped more than 6 percent on Friday as the dollar fell and a U.S. plan for risky assets revived optimism about demand, but analysts expected a large rise in stocks to temper gains.Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange was trading at $7,030 a tonne by 1515 GMT after hitting a session-high of $7,160. It closed at $6,749 on Thursday when it fell to a nine-month low of $6,625.Copper rose as the dollar slipped against the euro after the U.S. open had triggered a bout of short position -- bets on lower prices -- covering.'This has nothing to do with the metals fundamentals but is driven by the financials and the macroeconomic picture,' said Bloomsbury Minerals analyst Chris Welch.Expectations of a sharp slowdown in global economic growth have in recent months hit sentiment in metals markets. But on Friday, sweeping steps by governments worldwide to contain the spiralling credit crisis boosted sentiment.However, analysts said rising stocks would dampen optimism.Stocks of copper in LME warehouses at 19-month highs of 209,800 tonnes, are nearly double the levels in early May.'Copper is still quite exposed to the downside because inventories are rising and it is one of the more sensitive metals to the economy,' said Stephen Briggs, commoditiy strategist at RBS Sempra Metals.'Demand growth is likely to be very sluggish for some time and the costs of production are way below current prices.'UNDER PRESSUREA pick-up in physical activity could provide a boost to metals as it would alleviate demand concerns, and the narrow spread between copper prices in Shanghai and London could help boost imports to China, Barclays (nyse: BCS -  news  -  people ) Capital said in a note.'Until this buying emerges and stock builds slow, copper prices are likely to remain under pressure in the high $6,000s.'China consumes about 25 percent of global copper production, while the United States is estimated to consume some 15 percent.While Chinese demand may strengthen as activity resumes after the Olympics, the outlook for the U.S. construction activity has weakened substantially.Standard Chartered (other-otc: SCBEF.PK -  news  -  people ) cut its price outlook for three-month copper to $7,000 per tonne for the fourth quarter and said it expected the metal to stay around that level in early 2009.Nickel recovered from an earlier two-year low of $16,450 to trade at $16,825, compared with $16,750 on Thursday's close.Weak demand for stainless steel, widely used in kitchen appliances and cutlery, has caused nickel prices to tumble by more than 50 percent from the year's high of $34,700 per tonne marked in early March.Growth in demand for the metal from the stainless steel industry is forecast to be just 3-5 percent this year, versus previous expectations of 8-12 percent.'It all has to do with the general economic market -- people have less money to spend and are hesitant to replace their domestic items,' said Peter Fish at MEPS, a steel industry consultancy.LME inventories for aluminium rose sharply over the last month and have more than doubled since January last year to more than 1.3 million tonnes, their highest level since March 2004.Rising stocks and weak demand are expected to cap prices, even though on Friday aluminium prices were firmer.Aluminium rose to $2,527 from the close of $2,495 on Thursday, recovering from an eight-month low of $2,490 reached in the previous session.Zinc gained to $1,755 from $1,716 and tin to $17,040, up from Thursday's last quote of $16,800/16,825.Lead rose to $1,878 from Thursday's close of $1,805, after earlier hitting a session high of $1,910. The metal was boosted by short-covering and a 1,350 tonne fall in LME stocks to 69,175 tonnes.
