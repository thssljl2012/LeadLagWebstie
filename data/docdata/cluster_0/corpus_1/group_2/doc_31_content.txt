* Copper drifts lower, investors await US debt plan details* Volumes light ahead of week-long holidays in China* Long-term worries linger about cost of bailout (Updates prices to Shanghai close)SINGAPORE, Sept 26 (Reuters) - Copper prices eased in London and Shanghai on Friday, after modest overnight gains, but trade was thin as investors awaited the cobbling together of a plan to preserve the economy from septic debt.Market sentiment had lifted after the White House said 'significant progress' had been made in talks for a $700 billion rescue plan for financial markets, but the proposal has since stalled amid bickering between Democrats and Republicans.But data, lost in the babble surrounding the bailout plan, remained negative for industrial commodities. Orders for U.S. manufactured goods plunged in August, and the number of new jobless claims shot up, government reports show.'There has been hardly any trade today. My feeling is that although Wall Street rose overnight, people want to see the fine print of the rescue package as there are a lot of political questions left,' a dealer in Sydney said.'One thing is for certain -- a lot of money has gone down the drain and someone will have to pay the piper. That payment will be made in the form of poor growth and weak data going forward.'Most active Shanghai December copper fell 80 yuan to 53,360 yuan ($7,825) a tonne by the close. London Metal Exchange copper dipped $21 to $6,909 after rising 0.4 percent, or $25, in the previous session. Turnover was a paltry 547 lots.Dealers said volumes had also tailed off ahead of China's week-long holiday next week.Anecdotal evidence from Barclays (nyse: BCS -  news  -  people ) Capital about the state of China's metals industry showed domestic copper demand from wire and cable makers was firm but export demand was soft.'In particular, demand from the domestic infrastructure sector appears to be holding up well, though construction and autos appear weak,' BarCap's analysts said in a note.'However, inventory levels, both of refined copper and products, are low, suggesting that recent easing in China's copper demand growth has been, at least in part, driven by de-stocking.'Reuters calculations, based on the latest Chinese data, showed apparent demand growth was running at less than 5 percent in the first eight months of 2008, far slower than the 36 percent surge in 2007.

The difference flipped into a premium on Sept. 9 for the first time since January.Shanghai aluminium futures rose 110 yuan to 15,620 yuan. LME aluminium ticked up $2 to $2,511.On Thursday, Shanghai aluminium fell to a four-year low of 15,110 yuan on concerns of swelling stocks, and worries that China's smelters would continue to over produce.LME inventories have surged more than 20 percent since mid-August to stand at 1.37 million tonnes, enough for 13 days of world consumption. Shanghai stocks have also jumped -- up 120 percent to just under 200,000 tonnes.
