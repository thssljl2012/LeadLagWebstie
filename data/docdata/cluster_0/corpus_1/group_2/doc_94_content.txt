with battered financial stocks such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group leading Tokyo higher after the U.S. central bank rescued American International Group, averting a feared bankruptcy of the insurance giant. But Hong Kong, Shanghai and Mumbai shares tumbled as investors considered the impact of the ongoing financial crisis on credit markets in the months ahead. Shares of China Merchants Bank slumped in Hong Kong and Shanghai, while Icici Bank stock was pounded in Mumbai, after the two lenders disclosed their exposure to bonds in Lehman Brothers. 'This is a short-term relief for the market, but the credit crunch is going to continue. It may even worsen worldwide,' said Dale Tsang, managing director at Imperial Dragon Asset Management Co. in Hong Kong. 'I think this is just the beginning. We still have a long way to go.' Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose as high as 18,699.18 in early minutes, but the gains soon fizzled out. The index, which slumped 5.4% in the previous session, fell a further 3.6% to end at 17,637.19, its lowest finish since October 2006. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slumped 6.2% to 8,665.15, losing more than 13% in just two sessions. China's Shanghai Composite wavered between gains and losses in the early part of the session, before retreating. It ended 2.9% down at 1,929.05. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average touched a high of 11,880.03 during the session, but selling pressure forced it down. The benchmark, which tumbled 5% Tuesday, ended 1.2% up at 11,749.79. The broader Topix index rose 0.4% to 1,121.43. India's Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell 2.1% to 13,236.93 by late afternoon. South Korea's Kospi soared 2.7% to 1,425.26, a day after it plummeted 6.1%, and Australia's S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 slipped 0.6% to 4,722.20, unable to hold on to early gains. Rest of region Earlier in the day, regional markets had rallied on news the Federal Reserve board had authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend AIG (AIG:AIGNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) up to $85 billion. In return, the U.S. government will receive a 79.9% equity interest in AIG.  The news had come amid fears that the insurance giant was facing bankruptcy, and eased investor concerns about a worldwide impact. AIG, which has operations in more than 130 nations around the world, has a presence in most Asian countries. 'What the U.S. is doing at the moment is exactly the right thing to do. The alternative is financial catastrophe,' said Michael Heffernan, senior client adviser at Austock Stockbroking in Melbourne. He was, however, cautious about the outlook. 'We have seen enough of these things in recent times, not to be cocksure of anything,' he said. 'We have seen markets going up one day and getting clobbered the next day. The key words in this market are be aware and beware.' Singapore's Straits Times fell 2% to 2,412.85, Taiwan's Taiex added 0.8% to 5,800.87 and New Zealand's NZX 50 index advanced 1.3% to 3,269.93. Thailand's SET index fell 3.6% to 602.11, in line with the rest of the region. The losses also came amid concerns political uncertainty may continue in the country after the parliament elected Somchai Wongsawat, a brother-in-law of ousted former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, as the country's prime minister. Opposition People's Alliance for Democracy and its supporters had been protesting against Somchai's predecessor, Samak Sundaravej, for several weeks, alleging that Samak was an agent for Thaksin. Samak was sacked last week by a local court for hosting cookery shows on television while he was in office.
