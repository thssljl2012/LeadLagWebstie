SEOUL, Sept 11 (Reuters) - South Korea might hold off from pricing, or even cancel, a proposed sovereign bond to raise about $1 billion as investors demand a yield higher than Seoul is willing to offer to compensate for flagging credit conditions.Choi Jong-ku, head of the finance ministry's international finance bureau, told reporters the country was willing to offer a yield of up to 200 basis points (bps) over U.S. Treasuries for its first overseas sovereign bond in two years.Investors want a higher premium and some analysts said South Korea needs to offer a yield of 230 bps for the deal to be successful.The sale, which had been widely expected early Thursday New York time, is coming to the market at a sensitive time.Global risk aversion has been revived by a record quarterly loss reported by Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers (nyse: LEH - news - people ) and the Korean won hit four-year lows last week on concerns about capital flight from the country. 'There is a bit of a disconnect between what they are willing to pay versus what the investors want right now,' said Joel Kim, Hong Kong-based fund manager at ING (nyse: IND - news - people ) Investment Management.He said that many investors were benchmarking their expectations against South Korean credit default swaps -- insurance-like contracts that protect against defaults and restructuring.South Korea's five-year CDS  are trading around 140 bps. After taking into account currency swap spreads, the level suggested by Choi is barely enough to entice investors. 'At 200 bps over U.S. Treasuries, the new deal would come tighter than where CDS is trading. I would not be interested at that level,' said ING's Kim. While some analysts say Seoul needs to pay at least 230 bps over U.S. Treasuries, others said volatile markets meant it was difficult to estimate fair value for the deal.For example, the iTRAXX Asia ex-Japan high-yield index , a key measure of risk aversion in the region, has risen some 70 bps since the end of July to around 590 bps. It was trading around 360 bps at the start of the year. 'It's a market where spreads are bouncing around -- it's devilishly hard to call,' said a Hong Kong-based credit analyst, who declined to be identified. 'Its a buyers' market and you need to price accordingly.' Despite the obstacles, South Korean officials said they would press ahead to see if a deal can be achieved. 'We plan to continue negotiations until early Thursday (New York time) because of the gap (in opinion) over the appropriate issuing yield,' Choi said. 'The issuance may be delayed if conditions are not good, or even cancelled,' he said. Choi said there would be no big impact on investor sentiment should Seoul decide to cancel the deal, which would be South Korea's first overseas sovereign bond issue in two years.However, such cancellation could effect the plans of other issuers since the bond would be a benchmark for other South Korean borrowers, such as Korea National Housing Corp and POSCO (nyse: PKX - news - people ) Engineering and Construction.Seoul also hopes a successful deal would shore up investor confidence in Asia's fourth-largest economy in the wake of recent domestic financial market turmoil that pulled the won  down to a 4-year low last week.Barclays (nyse: BCS - news - people ) Capital, Goldman Sachs (nyse: GS - news - people ) , HSBC (nyse: HBC - news - people )  , Lehman Brothers , Samsung Securities  and UBS (nyse: UBS - news - people )  are arranging the deal.
