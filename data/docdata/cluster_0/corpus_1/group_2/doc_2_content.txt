with battered financial stocks such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group leading an advance in Tokyo after the U.S. central bank rescued American International Group, averting a feared bankruptcy of the insurance giant. But Hong Kong and Shanghai-listed shares dropped as investors considered the impact of the ongoing financial crisis on credit markets in the months ahead. 'This is a short-term relief for the market, but the credit crunch is going to continue. It may even worsen worldwide,' said Dale Tsang, managing director at Imperial Dragon Asset Management Co. in Hong Kong. 'Think about it. The credit market isn't going to be the same as in the last few years,' Tsang said. 'I think this is just the beginning. We still have a long way to go.' Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose as high as 18,699.18 in early minutes, but the gains soon fizzled out. The index, which slumped 5.4% in the previous session, was recently down 1.1% at 18,095.17. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell 2.5% to 8,998.51. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average touched a high of 11,880.03 during the session, before giving up some of its gains. The benchmark, which tumbled 5% Tuesday, was recently up 1.4% at 11,772.64. The broader Topix index gained 0.7% to 1,125.27. South Korea's Kospi soared 2.9% to 1,425.76, a day after it plummeted 6.1%, and Australia's S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 slipped 0.3% to 4,738.50, unable to hold on to early gains. China's Shanghai Composite wavered between gains and losses earlier in the day, before retreating. It was recently down 1.7% at 1,953.24. Singapore's Straits Times fell 0.7% to 2,444.13, Taiwan's Taiex added 1.7% to 5,852.41 and New Zealand's NZX 50 index advanced 1.1% to 3,262.56. India's Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose 0.3% to 13,558.61 in early minutes. Earlier in the day, regional markets had rallied on news the Federal Reserve board had authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend AIG (AIG:AIGNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) up to $85 billion, as 'a disorderly failure of AIG could add to already significant levels of financial market fragility and lead to substantially higher borrowing costs, reduced household wealth and materially weaker economic performance.' In return, the U.S. government will receive a 79.9% equity interest in AIG.  The news had come amid fears that the insurance giant was facing bankruptcy, and eased investor concerns about a worldwide impact. AIG, which has operations in more than 130 nations around the world, has a presence in most Asian countries. '[The Fed's rescue of AIG is] another bit of breathing space that the market has got. What the U.S. is doing at the moment is exactly the right thing to do. The alternative is financial catastrophe,' said Michael Heffernan, senior client adviser at Austock Stockbroking in Melbourne. Heffernan was cautious about the outlook. 'We have seen enough of these things in recent times, not to be cocksure of anything,' he said. 'We have seen markets going up one day and getting clobbered the next day. The key words in this market are be aware and beware.' Financial stocks were mixed, with shares of Mitsubishi UFJ (MTU:MTUNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) (JP:8306: news, chart, profile) rising 2% and Sompo Japan Insurance (JP:8755: news, chart, profile) advancing 0.5% in Tokyo. AMP (AU:AMP: news, chart, profile) gained 0.6% in Sydney and Woori Finance Holdings Co. rose 2.3% in Seoul. But China Life Insurance Co.

Shares of Canon Inc.
