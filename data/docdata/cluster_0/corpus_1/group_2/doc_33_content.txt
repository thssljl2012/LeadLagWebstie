LONDON (ShareCast) - Financials are keeping Footsie heavily in the red despite some good showings elsewhere. Tour operator Thomas Cook is the best performer after it said trading had been boosted by the collapse of XL Leisure. The tour operator added it is onfident it will meet full year expectations. Cook also confirmed talks to merge its Condor airline unit with Deutsche Lufthansa's Germanwings and parts of TUI Travel have been curtailed. In a company statement Thomas Cook confirmed it had walked away from discussions with Lufthansa and TUI Travel, 'as it became clear that the opportunity was not attractive.' ICAP is the man faller as the inter-dealer broker's forecasts raised concerns about full year profits. Trading volumes in the past few weeks have been "very high", it said, but only indicated that underlying profit for the year ending 31 March 2009 was likely to be 'ahead' of last year's 330m. 'If market developments and exchange rates are favourable, then the increase in profit could be well ahead of this figure,' it added. But the firm warned that current conditions made forecasting market activity during the rest of the year "much more difficult than usual".
