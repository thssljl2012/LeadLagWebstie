HONG KONG (XFN-ASIA) - Share prices were sharply lower as Wall Street tumbled after investment bank Lehman Brothers (News) filed for bankruptcy and insurance giant AIG scrambled to raise capital to shore up its balance sheet. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 504.48 points or 4.42 pct to 10,917.51 overnight, its worst one-day points drop since it lost 684.81 points on Sept 17, 2001, the first day of trading after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the US.China's announcement yesterday that it is cutting benchmark lending rates failed to calm investors, who are fearing that more bad news could be on the way from the US.At 10:54 am, the Hang Seng index was down 1,162.50 points or 6.01 pct at 18,190.40, off a low of 18,019.20 and high of 18,325.65.Turnover was 24.81 bln hkd.'Typical Hong Kong, investors here are overreacting to what happened on Wall Street,' said Howard Gorges, vice chairman at South China Securities.'Our market is now down more than New York where the troubles are happening, and this clearly reflects overreaction here,' he said.The Hong Kong market was closed yesterday for a public holiday, preventing an immediate reaction to Lehman bankruptcy news, Merrill Lynch's takeover by Bank of America and AIG's troubles.Lehman announced yesterday that it is seeking bankruptcy protection after it failed to find a buyer. Merrill averted a possible similar fate after it struck a deal to be bought over by Bank of America in a deal worth 50 bln usd.'There are lots of uncertainties out there and it will take time for confidence to get back,' Gorges said.'What is positive in all of these things is that it has brought problems to a head and some might take a view that we might soon start putting the worst behind us,' he said.'However, the biggest issue on other people's mind is how much more blood will be spilled on the floor and if there will be other major casualties,' he said.He noted that AIG needs to sort out its problems to avoid a bigger catastrophe for the financial sector. Gorges said China's decision to cut interest rates and ease the reserve ratio requirements on small banks did not help any amid the overall negative sentiment in the market.'There isn't much institutional presence in the Shanghai market and the Chinese government seems content in letting the country's stock markets find their own level,' he said.China banks were also hit by worries over their narrowed spreads as the central banks cut lending rates without corresponding adjustment in deposit rates. The People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that it is cutting the benchmark one-year lending rate by 27 basis points to 7.20 pct from today, the first cut in China's key interest rate since February 2002. Other lending rates were also cut, but all equivalent deposit rates were kept unchanged.The central bank also said that commercial bank reserve requirement will be cut by 100 basis points to 16.5 pct from September 25, but it will not apply to China's 'big four' lenders, Bank of Communications or China Post Savings Bank. Patrick Yiu, associate director at CASH Asset Management, said Hong Kong tracked other Asian markets which fell following Wall Street's tumble overnight.'I expect to see more pressures on Wall Street near-term and this will have a spillover adverse impact on Asian markets, including Hong Kong,' he said.'Markets are in a panic-selling stage at the moment, with no one unable to say when the bottom will be reached,' he said.'I believe stock markets will find a tough time in the next 3-6 months as conditions of global economies get worse,' he said.Yiu said investors ignored HKMA's liquidity offer as they sold down banking stocks. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said this morning that it would make liquidity available to any local institution that needs it, in an effort to calm the financial sector.HSBC fell 5.40 hkd or 4.42 pct to 116.70, Standard Chartered was down 11.10 hkd or 5.52 pct at 189.90, Hang Seng Bank was down 6.0 hkd or 3.82 pct at 151 and BOC Hong Kong down 1.62 hkd or 9.88 pct at 14.78.
