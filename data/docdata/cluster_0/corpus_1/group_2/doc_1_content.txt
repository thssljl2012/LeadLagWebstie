That was the biggest one-day price jump ever; gold's previous single-day record was a $64 gain on Jan. 29, 1980. In percentage terms, it was gold's largest one-day advance since 1999.The huge rally came after the U.S. government moved overnight to rescue troubled insurer American International Group Inc. with an $85 billion bailout loan. The emergency measure came a day after Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., a 158-year-old investment bank, filed for bankruptcy after failing to find a buyer.Fearing more tightening of credit markets, investors reacted swiftly and began dumping stocks and socking money into gold, silver and other safe-haven commodities. Gold is especially attractive during times of crisis because the metal is known for holding its value.Jon Nadler, analyst with Kitco Bullion Dealers Montreal, said buying accelerated as rumors spread across trading floors that another financial firm may be in trouble.'The psychology right now has everyone asking, 'Who's next?,' ' Nadler said. 'If another big bank falls, we could see an implosion and that has people very worried.'A weaker dollar also boosted gold prices. A falling greenback encourages investors to shift funds into hard assets like gold and other commodities that are bought as hedges against inflation and weakness in the U.S. currency.Gold rocketed above $1,000 per ounce for the first time in March, boosted by record oil prices, a weak dollar and worries that the U.S. economy was sliding into a recession. It has since pulled back sharply as a global commodities boom loses momentum.'The same market participants who got out of gold are coming back in now. This is the start of an upward move,' said Carlos Sanchez, analyst with CPM Group in New York, who predicted prices could climb back to $1,000 by year's end.Silver prices also jumped. The December contract soared $1.158 to settle at $11.675 per ounce. December copper, however, fell 4.65 cents to settle at $3.0425 a pound.Crude oil rebounded, too, after the AIG bailout eased worries that the insurance giant and other financial firms would liquidate commodities holdings to raise cash.Light, sweet crude for October delivery rose $6.01, or 6.59 percent, to settle at $97.16 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices tumbled more than $5 to close at $91.15 on Tuesday.Other commodities also rallied, with corn, wheat and soybeans all trading higher.This article appeared on page C - 3 of the San Francisco Chronicle
