, 9:50 AM ET United Kingdom - * Copper gains after U.S. announces risky assets plan * Copper inventories at 19-month highs raise demand worries* U.S. debt plan does little to alleviate bearish mood(Recasts, adds details, updates prices to mid-session)By Agnieszka FlakLONDON, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Copper jumped more than 6 percent on Friday as the dollar fell and a U.S. plan for risky assets revived optimism about demand, but analysts expected a large rise in stocks to temper gains.Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange hit $7,160 a tonne after trading at $6,875 a tonne in official rings. It closed at $6,749 at the close on Thursday when it fell to a nine-month low of $6,625.Traders said copper rose as the dollar slipped against the euro after the U.S. open had triggered a bout of short position -- bets on lower prices -- covering.Expectations of a sharp slowdown in global economic growth have in recent months hit sentiment in metals markets. But on Friday, sweeping steps by governments worldwide to contain the spiralling credit crisis boosted sentiment.However, analysts said rising stocks would dampen optimism.Stocks of copper in LME warehouses at 19-month highs of 209,800 tonnes, are nearly double the levels in early May."The inventory surges show that these markets are moving into surplus. That ... is going to cap enthusiasm today," said RBS analyst Nick Moore.UNDER PRESSUREA pick-up in physical activity could provide a boost to metals as it would alleviate demand concerns, and the narrow spread between copper prices in Shanghai and London could help boost imports to China, Barclays (nyse:  -  -  ) Capital said in a note."Until this buying emerges and stock builds slow, copper prices are likely to remain under pressure in the high $6,000s."China consumes about 25 percent of global copper production, while the United States is estimated to consume some 15 percent.While Chinese demand may strengthen as activity resumes after the Olympics, the outlook for the U.S. construction activity has weakened substantially.Standard Chartered (other-otc:  -  -  ) cut its price outlook for three-month copper to $7,000 per tonne for the fourth quarter and said it expected the metal to stay around that level in early 2009.Nickel recovered from an earlier two-year low at $16,450. It was untraded in the rings, but quoted at $16,750/16,800 from $16,750 at the close on Thursday.Weak demand for stainless steel, widely used in kitchen appliances and cutlery, has caused nickel prices to tumble by more than 50 percent from the year's high of $34,700 per tonne marked in early March.Growth in demand for the metal from the stainless steel industry is forecast to be just 3-5 percent this year, versus previous expectations of 8-12 percent."It all has to do with the general economic market --  have less money to spend and are hesitant to replace their domestic items like kettles, washing machines and refrigerators," said Peter Fish at MEPS, a steel industry consultancy.LME inventories for aluminium rose sharply over the last month and have more than doubled since January last year to more than 1.3 million tonnes, their highest level since March 2004. Rising stocks and weak demand are expected to cap prices, even though on Friday aluminium prices were firmer.Aluminium rose $17 to $2,512, recovering from an eight-month low of $2,490 on Thursday.Zinc gained $19 to $1,735 and tin was at $17,080/17,120, up from Thursday's last quote of $16,800/16,825.Lead rose more than 5 percent to $1,910 after trading up $35 at $1,840 in the rings. The metal was boosted by short-covering and a 1,350 tonne fall in LME stocks to 69,175 tonnes.(Editing by Jon Loades-Carter) Copyright 2008 Reuters, Click for      More On This Topic :    " Newsletters: " "Attach: " Article Controls   Newsletters       Related Sections             Related  Topics Starting A Small  Small  Loans Content  Software  Project  Software  e Software   Trading Center Brought to you by the sponsors below CEO Book Club Book Review  Book Review  Reveals All Krystle M.
