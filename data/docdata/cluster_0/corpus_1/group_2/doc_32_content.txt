THE Australian dollar was higher at noon after the announcement of a rescue package for embattled insurer AIG helped freshen the appetite for risk.At 12noon (AEST), the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.8034/37, up about US1.5 cents from yesterday's close of $US0.7886/90. During the morning, the local currency traded between a high of $US0.8074 and a low of $US0.7918. The Australian dollar opened the local session at 7am (AEST) at $US0.8001/07, but quickly dipped to its intraday low of $US0.7918. From there, the currency steadily ground higher to its current level above $US0.8000. Easy Forex currency dealer Anthony Botros said the biggest influence on the Australian dollar today had been the US Federal Reserve's decision to offer a $US85 billion rescue loan to AIG. 'That has prompted a rebound in confidence,'' Mr Botros said. Risk sentiment also recovered as the Federal left the federal funds rate on hold at two per cent. In its statement, the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee said the world's biggest economy was likely to keep growing. Reflecting the increased appetite for risk, the Australian dollar was also stronger against the Japanese yen at noon. At 12noon AEST, the Australian dollar was trading at 85.47/53 yen, up sharply from yesterday's close of 82.03/07 yen. 'The risk appetite type of currencies, such as the Aussie dollar, is back in favour for the time being,'' Mr Botros said. Mr Botros said he expected the volatility on currency markets to continue, given the turmoil on global financial markets. 'Volatility should stick around for some time yet. That's just the type of market that we are in,'' Mr Botros said. 'There's so much focus on the credit turmoil in the US and that has a large influence across the board.'' Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Glenn Stevens is due to address the Australian Institute of Company Directors lunch in Sydney at 1.20pm AEST today.
