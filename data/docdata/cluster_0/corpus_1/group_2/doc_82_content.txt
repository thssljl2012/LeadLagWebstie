THE first interest rate cut in seven years has made consumers feel more upbeat, a survey shows.The Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index has risen by a seasonally adjusted 7 per cent in September to 92.2 index points. The survey of 1200 people was taken in early September after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut interest rates for the first time since December 2001. Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said the 25 basis point rate cut, taking the cash rate to 7 per cent, had buoyed consumer sentiment. 'This type of result comes as no surprise,'' he said. 'It is a direct response to the decision by the Reserve Bank to cut their overnight cash rate by 0.25 per cent and the swift response by the banks to reduce their variable mortgage rates by a similar amount.'' The consumer sentiment reading has improved for two successive months since reaching a 16-year low in July. Mr Evans said the 16.7 per cent rise in consumer sentiment during August and September was the third largest two-month increase in the past decade, and the sixth biggest two-month rise since the series began in 1975. 'The compound improvement comes from the 8 per cent fall in petrol prices last month which boosted the index by 9.1 per cent and of course this month's good news on interest rates,'' he said. But compared with September 2007, the consumer sentiment index still has weakened by 20.3 per cent. In the September survey, respondents' confidence in economic conditions over the coming 12 months jumped by 19.5 per cent. People earning between $40,000 and $60,000 showed a 22.5 per cent climb in sentiment this month.
