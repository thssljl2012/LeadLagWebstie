AUSTRALIAN stocks staged a resilient comeback this afternoon, closing 1.5 per cent weaker as investors defied the escalating carnage on Wall Street. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index plunged 2.7 per cent at the opening of trade following a bloodbath on US markets overnight. By the close, however, the index was just 66.9 points lower at 4750.8 points as investors picked bargains among bombed-out stocks.Asian markets were not as fortunate, with Japan's Nikkei closing down 5 per cent, South Korea's Kospi off 6.1 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng losing 5.9 per cent in reaction to the chaos on Wall Street.Wall Street, reeling from the bankruptcy of Lehman Bros, the takeover of an ailing Merrill Lynch and the problems engulfing giant insurer AIG, last night suffered its worst session since the aftermath of the September 11 terror attacks. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 504.48 points, or 4.4 per cent, to 10,917.51. The last hour of trading was the worst, and financial markets are pointing to another weak session in New York tonight, with Dow Jones futures contracts down 82 points to 10,867.Aequs Securities Institutional dealer Ric Klusman said the ''big risk'' to the Australian market was whether AIG, with its $US1 trillion in assets, failed. AIG is seeking an emergency $US70 bailout from the US Federal Reserve, which at the weekend refused to provide financial support to Lehman.'If AIG fails, it's the world's largest insurance company and everybody has exposure one way or another,'' Mr Klusman told AAP.Australian banks were heavily hit today, with ANZ, NAB and the Commonwealth Bank revealed as having exposure to Lehman, whose bankruptcy is the biggest in corporate history.According to filings by Lehman with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, ANZ has $85.3 million worth of exposure to the bank through two banks loans. NAB has $28.3 million worth of exposure through two letters of credit, while the Commonwealth Bank of Australia said it had an exposure to Lehman of less than $150 million.ANZ shares dropped 51c to $16.36, NAB fell 92c to $21.90 and the Commonwealth was down 28c to $41.70. Shares in Macquarie Group struck a four-year low after a $2.26 tumble to $36.80, while smaller rival Babcock &amp;amp; Brown plunged 33 per cent to another record lower of $1.05.The big miners helped lead the afternoon come back, with BHP Billiton up 35c to $36.40 and takeover target Rio Tinto rising 42c to $106.85.
