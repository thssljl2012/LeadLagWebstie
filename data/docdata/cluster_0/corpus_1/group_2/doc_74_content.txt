'At the unscheduled Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Bank of Japan decided to take further steps in providing the U.S. dollar funds in view of the increased impact of liquidity pressures in the U.S. dollar on (the) Japanese money market,' the BOJ said in a statement. 'The bank will continue to closely coordinate with other central banks and to strive to maintain market stability through money-market operations,' it said. -By Natasha Brereton
