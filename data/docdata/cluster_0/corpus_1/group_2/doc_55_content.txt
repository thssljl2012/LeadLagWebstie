The 2007 rise was the biggest single-session improvement since the currency was floated in December 1983, according to Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) data.The Australian dollar surged by one-fifth of a US cent, minutes before the local session finished, to finish above $US0.8300 for the first time in two weeks.During the day, the local currency traded between a low of $US0.8285 and a high of 0.8403.Demand for high-yielding currencies, such as the Australian dollar, improved over the weekend after US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced a plan to buy up to $US700 billion of troubled mortgage assets from US financial institutions and shore up the US economy.'We want this to be clean, and we want it to be quick, and it's urgent that we get this done,' Mr Paulson said.Westpac currency strategist Jonathan Cavenagh said the Australian dollar performed strongly on Friday night after the US government the plan, which is yet to be approved by Congress.'The Aussie dollar performed very strongly through the course of the Friday session after we got more confirmation this package was likely to come to fruition,' he said.'US equity markets had a very good night.'The Australian dollar, which climbed above $US0.8400 after 0730 AEST, shed one US cent one hour later after US House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress would not give Wall Street a blank cheque.'We will not simply hand over a $700 billion blank cheque to Wall Street and hope for a better outcome,' she said.Ms Pelosi, a Democrat, said the bill proposed by Republican US President George Bush needed to include more independent oversight, protection for home owners and constraints on excessive executive payouts.Mr Cavenagh said Ms Pelosi's comments took some shine off the Australian dollar.'After the initial euphoria, we are seeing risk aversion creep back in the market - that's why the Aussie dollar has stalled at the 83 cent level,' he said.'Until Congress signs it (the bill), the market is going to remain very, very cautious.'Amid a moderation in risk appetite, the Australian dollar was expected to reach $US0.8350 in offshore trade, putting the currency short of its morning high, as traders took direction from global equity markets.Wall Street rallied on Friday night on the news with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 3.35 per cent.The Australia share market closed 4.5 per cent higher today as investors reacted positively to the US government's bailout plan.At 1415 AEST, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 was 216.4 points, or 4.5 per cent, higher at 5020.5 points, while the broader All Ordinaries gained 209.4 points, or 4.33 per cent to 5050.1.Have your sayYour commentEmail(not published)Location (optional)Remember meEmail me if comment is publishedTo prevent automated programs from using this form to send spam, please enter the letters you see in the image below into the appropriate input box.
