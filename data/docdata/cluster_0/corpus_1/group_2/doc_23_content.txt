Days after the Financial Services Authority showed short-sellers the door, shares in several of Britain's leading financial stocks tumbled regardless as concerns spilled over about the moribund mortgage market and the passage of the Federal Reserve's $700bn 'bad bank' plan through Congress.Led lower by HBOS, down 28.8 to 180.2p, the sector weighed heavily on the broader indices.At one point early in the afternoon, eight of the biggest 10 losers in the FTSE 100 were financial services companies six of them featuring on the FSA's new list of stocks that, at least until January, cannot be borrowed to sell with the objective of repurchasing for less. Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley lost a further 3p for a record low closing price of 24. After raising 400m in a rights issue last month, the FTSE 250 company now has an entire market value below 360m. Royal Bank of Scotland fell 12 to 203p. Barclays fared better, slipping a relatively modest 15 to 357p despite a move by Dresdner Kleinwort analysts to downgrade its rating on the London bank from 'hold' to 'reduce' while upgrading its Scottish counterpart from 'add' to 'buy'. Dresdner Kleinwort analyst James Invine said research on corporate credit quality indicated Barclays had moved 'up the risk curve' while RBS had moved down it. 'We think that Barclays still has another 3.6bn of structured credit writedowns to take,' Mr Invine said. Elsewhere in the sector, Icap, the inter-dealer broker, slipped 20 to 407 despite Credit Suisse lifting its target price 20p to 485p, albeit while maintaining an 'underperform' rating on the company. Analyst Rupak Ghose said that while Icap's valuation was 'increasingly attractive, we believe that consensus expectations of organic growth are ambitious'. There were rare bright spots among financial stocks. HSBC firmed 8 to 874p while F&amp;amp;C Asset Management topped the FTSE 250 table, climbing 5 to 80p.But the large and mid-cap indices were broadly seas of red as economic sentiment continued to deteriorate. The FTSE 100 shed 100.14 points to close at 5136.12. The FTSE 250 fared worse, down 298.43 points to 8454.58. In late trading, the Dow Jones was down 125.4 points at 10890.3.With metal prices broadly lower, miners lost substantial ground. Eurasian Natural Resources fell 78 to 608p, followed by Vedanta Resources, down 177 to 15.27. Oil softened, but too little to mitigate the damage done by the biggest single-day surge on record, a day earlier, when crude in New York was at one stage up more than $25 a barrel.There were the usual victors and victims. British Airways fell 8 to 210, while budget carrier easyJet also slipped, 23 to 339. Tui Travel was down 14 to 210 while competitor Thomas Cook Group fell 13 to 233. But energy and oil companies broadly gained. International Power was up 8 to 364, aided by Citigroup, which upgraded the group's equities from 'hold' to 'buy' on the back of a 20pc decline in price over the summer.Despite the upgrade, Citi analysts said that, while broad conditions in International Power's key markets remained favourable, 'earnings growth is slowing and we believe will be more difficult and capital intensive to achieve'. The power generation company was among the biggest blue-chip movers, along with household products group Unilever, which found an extra 35 to close at 989p. Centrica, the owner of British Gas, climbed 4 to 330 while Scottish &amp;amp; Southern Energy and National Grid were respectively up 12p to 13.91 and 3 to 707. Other defensive stocks also enjoyed a predictably strong performance, including pharmaceuticals group Astrazeneca, up 16 to 25.37. In the FTSE 250, Hikma Pharmaceuticals firmed 5p, closing at 448p. In real estate, commercial property group Hammerson made the biggest gain among FTSE 100 stocks, up 23 to 989, but housebuilders lost ground after data revealed that mortgage approvals have hit their lowest level in at least a decade.Barratt Developments fell 10 to 131, Taylor Wimpey dropped 2 to 45 and Persimmon was down 8 to 418p.Despite their losses, the trio of residential property giants now firmly embedded in the FTSE 250 after tumbling in value since the credit crisis took hold fared better than many others.Among the worst performers, Mecom, the European newspaper group, continued its volatile run, dipping 4 to 18p to top the table of those to lose ground.Punch Taverns was close behind, falling 27 to 185p in a downbeat day for the pub sector after a trading update from Mitchells &amp;amp; Butlers, owner of the All Bar One chain, highlighted cost pressures in the industry. Although Numis analysts said Mitchells &amp;amp; Butlers was demonstrating 'further market out-performance', shares in the group fell 17 to 255p. Gem Diamonds firmed 7 to 717p after the group announced a $5.9m acquisition that was welcomed by Citi analyst Liam Fitzpatrick as a likely 'strong earnings and value driver'. Among the small-cap companies, Arena Leisure slipped to 27p despite a statement from the Reuben Brothers, the owners of rival raceourse operator Northern Racing, clarifying that they had increased their stake.The Reuben Brothers now hold a total of 20.25pc of Arena, which operates seven tracks including the racecourses at Doncaster and Windsor, comprising an equity stake of 15.4pc and the rest in contracts for difference.
