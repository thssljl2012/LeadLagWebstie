LONDON (MarketWatch) -- U.S. stock futures dropped Wednesday after the U.S. government seized control of American International Group bankruptcy and as single-family building permits dropped to a 26-year low. S&amp;amp;P 500 futures fell 16.6 points to 1,199.60 and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 16 points to 1,717.00. Dow industrial futures fell 106 points. 'Due to this week's failures in the financial sector, banks, insurance firms, the fund industry, and non-regulated financial institutions will have to absorb further losses,' said Tim Brunne, a strategist at UniCredit. 'There is systemic pain in the financial world.' 'The futures are down on disappointment the job couldn't get done privately, but this should end up being a positive,' said Marc Pado, a strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. U.S. stocks climbed on Tuesday on speculation of an AIG rescue, which took away from an initial negative reaction to the Fed's move to keep interest rates at 2%. The Dow industrials rose 141 points, the Nasdaq Composite added 27 points and the S&amp;amp;P 500 rose 20 points. Terms of the deal call for the U.S. government to get a 79.9% stake of the insurance giant in return for an $85 billion, two-year loan priced at 8.5 percentage points over LIBOR. The Wall Street Journal reported that AIG (AIG:AIGNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) CEO Robert Willumstad is being replaced by ex-Allstate CEO Edward Liddy.

On the data front, home building tumbled again in August, with the number of new building permits for single-family homes dropping to a 26-year low, the Commerce Department estimated Wednesday. Starts of new homes fell 6.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 895,000, the lowest in 17 years, and much weaker than the 955,000 rate expected by economists surveyed by MarketWatch. The U.S. current account deficit widened to $183.1 billion in the second quarter, or 5.1% of gross domestic product, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday. The increase in the deficit was accounted for by a decrease in the surplus on income and an increase in the deficit on goods. Weekly energy inventory data also is due for release. The FTSE 100 rose 1.3% in London and the Nikkei 225 rose 1.2% in Tokyo, though markets in Russia and China both saw big losses. Crude oil futures rose $3.22 to $94.37 a barrel and the dollar lost ground against the euro. Steve Goldstein is MarketWatch's London bureau chief.
