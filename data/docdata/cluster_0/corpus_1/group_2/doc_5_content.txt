London markets were on flying form in early trading as the temporary ban on shorting financial shares came into effect. The FTSE 100 (UKX) gained more than 6% to soar to 5173 after the City watchdog moved to curb the practice of short-selling in a bid to stem the deepening credit crisis. Asian and US markets notched up the gains overnight, as central banks pumped in $180 billion dollars into the money markets on Thursday to boost liquidity levels. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed almost 4% to 11019 after the US Government proposed to mop up toxic mortgage-related debt using taxpayers' money. However, trading remained volatile in the banking sector with both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley losing ground on the back of speculation that more takeovers could be on the cards. Banks were riding high as investors cheered the shorting ban which aims to prevent further runs on their shares. Credit crisis casualty HBOS (HBOS) was up 23% to 212.5p with Barclays (BARC) up 18.3% to 356p and Lloyds TSB (LLOY) up 26% to 299.25p. HSBC (HSBA), which walked away from buying a 51% stake in Korea Exchange Bank due to the market turbulence, rose almost 11% to 880p. Elsewhere, FTSE 250 publishing group Informa (INF) saw its shares drop almost 7% to 319p after the private equity consortium led by Providence Equity Partners withdrew its offer to buy the group due to funding issues.
