(Xinhua via COMTEX News Network) -- Australia's residential building starts have plummeted to their lowest number in a year, supporting the need for lower interest rates, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Monday. Just 38,348 homes were started in the three months to June, a seasonally-adjusted drop of 3.7 percent on the March quarter, the statistics showed. Private housing starts rose by 4.1 percent, but other residential buildings tumbled by 17 percent. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its key cash rate for the first time in nearly seven years this month, ending a run of 12 consecutive increases spanning six years.
