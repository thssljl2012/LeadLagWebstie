(Adds broker, Morningstar comments, REITs)MELBOURNE, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Australian shares extended losses on Tuesday to 2.5 percent as doubts grew about whether a $700 billion U.S. financial bailout package would work and as oil prices eased from overnight highs.The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index  was down 127.2 points at 4,893.3 at 0432 GMT, after rising 4.5 percent on Monday.Trading volumes on top stocks were much lighter than last week, with a ban on most short-selling in place.'Everyone's just standing on the sidelines waiting to hear a little bit more on the plans for the bailout,' said Macquarie private client adviser Lucinda Chan.Morningstar, which rates investment funds, said it was comfortable with the ratings it has on funds that normally use short-selling as part of their strategy to improve returns, but was monitoring how the ban was affecting their performance.'We're not going to put a blanket hold on these managers just because there's been a short-term change in the regulation,' said Morningstar Australia senior research analyst Chris Douglas.New Zealand's NZX-50 index  was down 1 percent, or 31.16 points, to 3,224.6 in late trade.STOCKS ON THE MOVE* Lingering worries about the extent of the global credit crunch and a slowdown in economic growth weighed on property trusts, which were among the weakest stocks. Westfield Group  fell 4.3 percent to A$18.00 and Stockland Group  slid 9.3 percent to A$5.74.0450 GMT* Gold miners, buoyed early by soaring gold prices, came off early highs but remained the top gainers on the day. Newcrest Mining  jumped 6 percent to A$27.04, while Lihir Gold  rose 3.8 percent to A$2.75. 0420 GMT* As oil prices fell by $1 a barrel after leaping 16 percent late on Monday, oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum  turned down 0.2 percent to A$56.88 after trading as high as A$58.80. Oil Search  fell 1.3 percent to A$5.55.0426 GMT* Banks resumed their declines as worries resurfaced about the impact of the credit crunch, bad debts and National Australia Bank Ltd's  exposure to $4.5 billion in collateralised debt obligations.Macquarie Group  fell 5.6 percent to A$35.69, wiping out Monday's gain. NAB fell 2.6 percent to A$23.66, while Westpac Banking Corp  fell 2.8 percent to A$24.03.'I still think our financial stocks have another leg down. It has nothing to do with short selling and everything to do with further bad debts,' Elliott at MM&amp;amp;E Capital said.0057 GMT* BHP Billiton, down 0.8 percent, and Rio Tinto, down 0.9 percent, fell despite higher base metals prices overnight, as poor sentiment on Wall Street and in Europe weighed on the stocks.Funds are still able to short BHP Billiton's shares in London and buy Rio Tinto in Australia to play the takeover offer arbitrage.The discount between Rio's share price and the value of BHP's offer of 3.4 shares for every Rio Tinto share narrowed to 15 percent in London, while remaining at 17 percent in Australia.0057 GMT (Reporting by Sonali Paul)
