The Australian dollar was higher at noon as the continuing turmoil surrounding troubled US investment bank Lehman Brothers hurt the US dollar, giving the local currency a boost.At 12pm, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.8214/18, up about 1.5 US cents from Friday's close of $US0.8061/65.During the morning, the local currency traded between a low of $US0.8206 and a high of $US0.8226.The Australian dollar rose about two US cents during the offshore weekend session as Lehman Brothers' difficulties and weak US retail sales figures for August prompted a fresh round of US dollar selling.The unit has managed to hold onto those gains since it opened at $US0.8201/04 at 7am today.Commonwealth Bank of Australia currency strategist Joseph Capurso said overseas factors, particularly the Lehman Brothers story, was the biggest influence on the Australian dollar.''It doesn't look like there will be many movers happening locally today,'' Mr Capurso said.Mr Capurso said he expected the Australian dollar to trade quietly ahead of tomorrow's release of the minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) September board meeting.''That could see a bit of selling in the Aussie if it turns out the Reserve Bank considered a 50-point cut at their last meeting,'' Mr Capurso said.Also, the US Federal Open Market Committee meets on September 16 (US time).While the US dollar has performed well over recent months, Mr Capurso said he expected the American currency to eventually struggle as negative news about the US economy comes out.''There's a good chance that sometime before the end of the year you're going to get a big slump in the US dollar as people get really worried about the US economy,'' Mr Capurso said.AAPStory ToolsGot news tips for us?
