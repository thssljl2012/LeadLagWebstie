Australian shares have plunged as the latest wave of weakness, lopping off $38 billion in value, as fears from the bankruptcies and bailouts on Wall Street this week gathered momentum.The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index fell as much as 3.5pc, or 164.5 points, to 4557.7 in early trading on Thursday morning.Wall Street plunged more than 4pc overnight after the US government rescued insurance behemoth American International Group for $107 billion dollars.James McGlew, senior dealer at Argonaut Securities, said: ''We're getting to the capitulation stage,'' he said. ''People are just lining up and throwing the baby out with the bathwater.''''I went through the 1987 crash and you need to get to a point where the fear flushes the market out.''However, Mr McGlew said the market still had room lose another 400 points before bottoming out.When the market eventually turns around, the weakness from the banking sector means it's not going to bounce straight back to 5000, he said.There are, nonetheless, buying opportunities arising in companies with good, transparent balance sheets, he said.The financial sector has been in the cross hairs of investors, with the big investment banks losing more than a fifth of their market cap.Macquarie Bank was down as much as 21.8pc, or $7.03, to $26.90 in early trading, and Babcock &amp;amp; Brown lost 21pc, or 20 cents, to 72 cents.ANZ Bank lost as much as 5pc, or 80 cents, to $15.20, the Commonwealth Bank lost 4.8pc, or $1.98, to $39.12, NAB lost 10.1pc, or $2.10, to $18.60, Westpac lost 4.5pc, or $1.05, to $21.96, St George lost pc, or $1.20, to $28.95 and Suncorp Metway lost as much as 19.3pc, or $1.71, to $7.15.''It's pretty savage,'' said Lisa Jarvis of ABM Amro Morgans, ''You'd have to say there's a bit of panic with concern for potential exposures to this off-shore crisis.''Ms Jarvis said the sell-downs mean retail and institutional brokers are trying to limit their risks. In turn, the lower prices trigger margin calls, causing people to be forced sellers, which only adds to the momentum.The end of the September futures contract has also triggered higher trading volumes, she said.Investors have been spooked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the rushed takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America at the weekend.Gold has fared well amid the market panic. The precious metal will continue to do well, said Mr McGlew, because its performance, unlike the bulk commodities, isn't driven by perceptions of global economic growth which are deteriorating.Lihir Gold was up as much as 18pc, or 38 cents, to $2.52, and Newcrest was up as much as 15.2pc, or $3.25, to $26.64 in early trading.
