THE Australian share market closed more than 1 per cent weaker following general weakness across the board and losses on Wall Street. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 was down 42.2 points, or 1.19 per cent, at 3516.9, while the broader All Ordinaries index dropped 35.4 points, or 1.01 per cent, to 3461.3. 'Obviously we're following from the weaker lead from the US,' Macquarie Equities Brisbane-based adviser Helen Spencer said. 'With the US holiday tonight, there is likely to be some lacklustre trading ... with no lead from offshore.' US markets were closed last night, Australian time, for the Presidents Day holiday. 'Most of the market is trading on the backfoot, the theme is weakness generally across the board, you couldn't pinpoint one particular sector,' Ms Spencer said. In the resources sector Rio Tinto fell 20c to $50.80, its rival BHP Billiton fell 56c to $32.14.   The major banks were mixed. ANZ rose 2c to $12.98, Westpac fell 1c $16.94, Commonwealth Bank fell $1.78, or 5.67 per cent, to $29.62 and National Australia rose 12c to $18.57.

Commercial radio broadcaster Austereo Group reported a flat first-half profit and said it expected conditions to be tight in the second half. Its stock was 8.5c, or 7.91 per cent, down at $1.16.   Rural services and automotive components supplier Futuris yesterday booked a first-half net loss of $329.2 million and said it was progressing with the sale of its 43 per cent stake in beef producer Australian Agricultural Company (AAco).   The shares of both companies were in a trading halt, with Futuris last trading at 35.5c and AAco last trading at $1.575.
