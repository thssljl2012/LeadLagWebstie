SINGAPORE, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Shares of Venture Corp   gained as much as 6.8 percent on Friday despite a 94 percent drop   in quarterly net profit, helped by bullish analyst reports about   the firm.   Nomura on Friday upgraded Venture, Singapore's largest   electronics contract manufacturer, to 'buy' from 'neutral' citing   the firm's higher margins and plan to maintain its dividend of   S$0.50 a share.   Other brokerage firms with buy or overweight recommendations   on Venture after the results included Credit Suisse, Citigroup,   Bank of America/Merrill Lynch and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.   Venture said on Thursday its fourth quarter net profits   tumbled 94 percent from a year ago mainly due to non-operational   charges related to fair value and impairment losses.   By 0233 GMT, Venture was up 6.8 percent at S$4.40,   outperforming the benchmark Straits Times Index which fell 0.9   percent.
