The Australian share market was lower in noon trade as the banks and big miners reacted to an erratic US lead.  At 1200 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 24.2 points, or 0.69 per cent, at 3,484.4, while the broader All Ordinaries index fell 21.5 points, or 0.63 per cent, to 3,424.2.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index contract was 19 points lower at 3447 on a volume of 10,047 contracts.  ABN Amro Morgans private client adviser Craig Walker said the decline was due to an erratic US lead overnight, depressing the big four banks and miners to weigh down the local market broadly. 'The Dow was jumping all over the place last night and ended up closing down, so no particularly strong leads for us today,' he said. 'The mining sector as a whole has been a bit weak and gold was back below $US900 dollars overnight. 'Between the four majors, they've probably contributed ten negative points to the index.' Among the major banks at 1201 AEDT, Commonwealth Bank of Australia lost 34 cents to $29.60, Westpac fell 31 cents to $16.21, National Australia Bank declined 16 cents to $18.74 and ANZ slipped 25 cents to $12.21.  Rio Tinto slipped $1.51, or 3.06 per cent, to $47.89, while rival BHP Billiton, the largest company on the Australian Securities Exchange, fell 15 cents, or 0.45 per cent, to $33.19.  The decline extended to local gold miners as the spot price of gold slipped to $US896.50 an ounce, down $US11.20 on Monday's local close of $US907.70 an ounce.  Newcrest lost 30 cents, or 0.93 per cent, to $31.90, Lihir fell six cents, or 1.89 per cent, to $3.11 and Sino Gold retreated 23 cents, or 4.56 per cent, to $4.81.  2009 AAP Brought to you by
