Meanwhile, US President Barack Obama's stimulus plan cleared a key hurdle in the Senate today, with a final ballot scheduled for tomorrow. (Tuesday noon, US time).

ABN Amro Morgans private client adviser Craig Walker said the decline was due to an erratic US lead overnight, depressing the big four banks and miners to weigh down the local market broadly.

'The mining sector as a whole has been a bit weak and gold was back below $US900 dollars overnight.  'Between the four majors, they've probably contributed ten negative points to the index.''
