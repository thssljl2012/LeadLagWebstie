At 12.04pm (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 82 points, or 2.37 per cent, at 3382.3, while the broader All Ordinaries index had plunged 75.4 points, or 2.21 per cent, to 3336.8.  CommSec market analyst Savanth Sebastian said the local market had been heavily weighed down by continuing bleak economic news from the US.  Among the major banks, National Australia Bank had sunk 34 cents to $17.54 at 1210 AEDT, Commonwealth Bank had shed 66 cents to $28.35, Westpac had lost 44 cents to $16.34 and ANZ was down 19 cents to $12.23.  Local investors were punishing companies with poor earnings results, Mr Sebastian said.  A prime example was fund manager Perpetual, which reported an 84 per cent slump in first half profit due to direct impacts of the financial crisis.  Its shares were down 4.8 per cent to $24.80 at 12.06pm.  Mr Sebastian said even a positive result from Woodside Petroleum had failed to inspire the market because macroeconomic indicators pointed to ongoing weakness in commodity prices, including oil.  Australia's second largest oil and gas producer posted a 73 per cent jump in full year profit on stronger production and commodity prices.  Woodside's shares had given up 1.79 per cent to $31.82 at, while Santos had fell 2.46 per cent to $14.29 and Oil Search slid 3.43 per cent to $4.50.  'Base metal prices were significantly weaker overnight, sending resource stocks down 3 per cent'' in late morning trade, Mr Sebastian said.  Resources were down.  BHP Billiton dropped 4.16 per cent to $30.40, while debt-laden rival Rio Tinto had retreated $2.14, or 4.27 per cent, to $47.93.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange at 12.04pm, the March share price index futures contract had shed 90 points to 3351 on a volume of 14,024 contracts.  At 1212 AEDT, the spot price of gold in Sydney was $US967.20 per fine ounce, up $US8.05 on Tuesday's local close of $US959.15.  The market once again had embraced the precious metal's role as a safe haven investment in troubled economic times, Mr Sebastian said.  Gold miner Newcrest had gained $1.63, or 4.75 per cent, to $35.91 at 1215 AEDT, Newmont had risen 18 cents, or 2.77 per cent, to $6.68 and Lihir Gold had put on 13 cents, or 3.75 per cent, to $3.60.  Among the major retailers, Woolworths had dipped 21 cents to $27.49 at 1216 AEDT and Coles owner Wesfarmers had eased 15 cents to $16.14.  The Reject Shop on Wednesday posted a ten per cent rise in first half profit, and said it was confident of achieving its earlier forecast full year profit. Its shares fell 12 cents, or 1.15 per cent, to $10.28 by 1228 AEDT.  Fairfax was the worst performing media stock at 1217 AEDT, down five cents, or 4.78 per cent, to 99.5 cents. News Corp had lost 28 cents, or 2.58 per cent, to $10.56 while its non-voting scrip had fallen 19 cents, or 1.95 per cent, to $9.56.  The most traded stock by volume was Australia's third largest diversified miner, OZ Minerals, with 86.9 million shares worth $52.58 million changing hands.  Shares in the debt-laden takeover target were down 4.5 cents, or 6.89 per cent, at 60 cents at 1220 AEDT.
