TOKYO, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.6 percent on Wednesday, at one point touching a three-month intraday low, as worries about a deepening U.S. recession and European banks hit financials and property firms.   Toyota Motor Corp bucked the trend to rise after the Nikkei business daily reported it plans to boost production in Japan by about 30 percent in May compared with the monthly output of the three preceding months as inventories fall.  But sentiment was fragile after the Dow Jones index and S&amp;P 500 each fell to their lowest levels since Nov. 20, despite U.S. President Barack Obama signing into law a $787 billion stimulus package, as weak manufacturing data showed the recession was deepening. 'What's happening shouldn't necessarily be affecting the market that much, since the European bank issue isn't all that new and the U.S. manufacturing data shouldn't usually have that much impact,' said Hideyuki Ishiguro, a supervisor in the investment strategy department of Okasan Securities. 'But ever since the market was disappointed by the U.S. bank plan, which seemed just to be putting things off, sentiment has become weak and the market has become sensitive to bad news.' The benchmark Nikkei shed 122.73 points to 7,522.78 after earlier falling to 7,479.18, its lowest intraday level since Nov. 21. On Tuesday it marked its lowest close since Oct. 28, the day it hit a 26-year intraday low of 6,994.90.  U.S. financial stocks sank to 14-year lows after Moody's Investors Service said banks could be hit by the recession in Eastern Europe.  Factory activity in New York State fell to a record low in February, the New York Federal Reserve said on Tuesday, suggesting that January's minor halt in the worsening of factory data was an aberration rather than a signal of recovery that would bring about a rebound in the economy.  Growing credit worries hit financial and property shares in Japan, which extended losses marked on Tuesday.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group fell 2.7 percent to 440 yen and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Japan's No. 3 bank, shed 3.7 percent to 3,150 yen. Mizuho Financial Group lost 2 percent to 196 yen.  Mitsui Fudosan, Japan's largest real estate developer, lost 4.1 percent to 1,052 yen while Sumitomo Realty &amp; Development fell 4.2 percent to 964 yen and Mitsubishi Estate lost 3.1 percent to 1,055 yen.  The real estate subindex lost 3.3 percent, the biggest loser among the subindexes.  But Toyota rose 1 percent to 3,040 yen and Honda Motor Co gained 0.9 percent to 2,245 yen, partly on a sense in the market that the steps they have taken to deal with the poor economy were relatively decisive, Ishiguro said.  Obayashi Corp and fellow general contractor Shimizu Corp extended gains, with Obayashi up 2.1 percent at 430 yen and Shimizu climbing 2.7 percent to 383 yen.
