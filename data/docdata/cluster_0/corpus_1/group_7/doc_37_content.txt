The Australian stock market is trading sharply lower following a negative lead from Wall Street and led lower by the big miners.  Around midday, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 82.3 points, or 2.4%, at 3320.1, while the broader All Ordinaries index lost 74.8 points, or 2.2%, to 3278.2.  Stocks with international exposure were among the worst performers when trade resumed for the week, Macquarie Private Wealth adviser Helen Spencer said.  'We're still very much on the back foot after a fairly weak session on Wall Street on Friday night,'' Ms Spencer said.  'Resources are probably taking much of the brunt today but it's really right across the board.''  Big miners tumble  In the resources sector, market giant BHP Billiton, which went ex-dividend today, sank $1.31, or 4.3%, to $29.20, while Rio Tinto lost $3.08, or 6.1%, to $47.21.  Fortescue Metals shares entered a trading halt pending an announcement about a capital raising. They last traded at $2.83.  Energy stocks were also lower, with Santos dropping 39 cents, or 2.7%, to $14.17, Woodside giving up $1.14, or 3.4%, to $32.23 and Oil Search off 12 cents, or 2.6%, to $4.45.  Banks hit by Wall Street  Banking shares were down but not as much as the miners.  NAB lost 40 cents, or 2.2%, to $17.61, the Commonwealth Bank lost 64 cents, or 2.2%, to $28.93, Westpac fell 21 cents, or 1.3%, to $16.17, and ANZ lost 27 cents, or 2.2%, to $12.18.  'Financials are still seeing some weakness flowing through from the weaker financials in the US on Friday night, and insurers are on the back foot, as well,'' Ms Spencer said.  On Wall Street, financial stocks led the market to a six-year low on concerns the US government may move to take control of troubled banks  Fairfax falls  In corporate news, Fairfax Media reported a bottom line loss for the first half, and says it is battening down the hatches to ride out a downturn in the economy that is hurting the advertising market.  Fairfax shares were 2 cents lower, or 1.9%, lower at $1.03.  'It's not unsurprising. I think all the media stocks are certainly having difficulty in this economic environment with lower advertising revenue,'' Mr Heffernan said.  Steel producer BlueScope Steel reported first half profit up 251%, but says its underlying full-year result could be a loss if the economy continues to worsen.  Its shares were 32 cents, or 10.3% lower at $2.80.  Mr Heffernan said BlueScope's downbeat outlook statement had hurt its stock.  'The market is obviously not that pleased with the result but looking to the future they say the next half is going to be a lot weaker.
