TOKYO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - The benchmark Nikkei average fell 0.4 percent and the broader TOPIX was 0.6 percent lower as of 1041 GMT on Monday.   The following stocks were on the move:   **CONSUMER FINANCE FIRMS FALL AFTER SFCG BANKRUPTCY NEWS**   Consumer finance firms such as Takefuji Corp tumbled after SFCG Co Ltd, a high-interest lender to smaller companies, filed for bankruptcy protection with 338 billion yen ($3.6 billion) in debt on bad real estate-backed loans and tightening credit.   SFCG, which had borrowed heavily from foreign banks including Lehman Brothers, has also been slammed by tighter interest rate regulations in the consumer lender industry, forcing it to repay previous interest that was deemed too high.   Takefuji tumbled 10.5 percent to 419 yen and Aiful Corp fell 11.7 percent to 113 yen.   0140 GMT   **ELPIDA MEMORY (News) TUMBLES AFTER TARGET PRICE CUT**   Memory chip maker Elpida Memory Inc tumbled 11.1 percent to 455 yen after Deutsche Bank cut its target price on the company to 260 yen from 320 yen and reiterated its 'sell' rating.   'A strong recovery in DRAM demand appears unlikely, and production adjustments related to cutbacks at competitors are likely to be insufficient,' wrote analyst Takeo Miyamoto.   0054 GMT ** (News) UP AFTER GOLD SURGE**   Sumitomo Metal Mining, a comprehensive smelter of non-ferrous metals and leader in overseas mining, rose 3.6 percent to 1,059 yen after gold topped the psychologically important $1,000 per ounce level late last week, when nervous investors picked up the metal amid tumbling stock markets.   0042 GMT   **BANK SHARES DOWN ON U.S. BANK NATIONALISATION WORRIES**   Mizuho Financial Group and other bank shares fell on growing worries that the U.S. government may be forced to nationalise some big banks, fears that sent U.S. bank shares tumbling.   Mizuho, Japan's No.2 bank, fell 3.7 percent to 181 yen and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group lost 2.3 percent to 419 yen. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group lost 3.0 percent to 2,875 yen.   The banking sub-index fell 2.45 percent, underperforming the Nikkei 225.   0014 GMT   **SFCG AWASH WITH SELL ORDERS ON BANKRUPTCY NEWS**   SFCG Co Ltd, a lender to smaller companies, was awash with sell orders with the price indicated at 1,252 yen -- down 3.1 percent from Friday's close -- after it said it has filed for bankruptcy protection with 338 billion yen ($3.6 billion) in debt.   0006 GMT
