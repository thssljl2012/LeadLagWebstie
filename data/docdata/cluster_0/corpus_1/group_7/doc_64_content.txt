DUBAI: Saudi Arabia's economy is set to contract 1.8 per cent this year on oil output cuts and weak non-oil growth, said Samba Financial Group, the latest bank to forecast a slowdown in the world's top oil exporter.  Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the largest Arab economy would resume at 4.2pc this year, Samba said.  The slowdown this year would be mainly spurred by a 14pc reduction in Saudi oil output this year as the Opec member attempts to support global prices, which have slumped more than $100 a barrel since peaking last July. 'Although we expect the non-oil sector to expand by around 2pc, this will be more than offset by the contraction in oil output,' Samba said. EFG-Hermes and Bank of America-Merrill Lynch also expect Saudi GDP to contract this year.  Samba said private sector imports were weakening, with the value of new letters of credit opened in December collapsing by 23pc compared with November.
