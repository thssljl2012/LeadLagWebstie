(RTTNews) - The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a higher opening on Thursday. Yesterday's indecision reflected guarded optimism of market participants about the various fiscal measures announced to tackle the credit crisis. Considering the oversold nature of the markets and cautious optimism among traders, we can expect some bounce up in today's session. Sentiment over the course of session may also hinge on the economic reports to be released during the trading session.  U.S. stocks showed a considerable degree of volatility over the course of Wednesday's session before closing on a mixed note. Discouraging economic evidence on the housing market and continued apprehension about the viability of various stimulus plans announced roiled the markets even amid another fresh initiative announced by President Obama to help troubled homeowners.  The Dow Industrials ended the session up merely 3 points or 0.04% at 7,556, while the S&amp;P 500 Index receded 0.75 points or 0.10% to 788 and the Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 2.69 points or 0.18% to 1,468.  Eighteen of the Dow components ended the session lower. While Bank of America (BAC) (down 6.73%), Citigroup (C) (down 4.90%), Alcoa (AA) (down 3.85%), General Motors (GM) (down 5.50%) ended sharply lower, Wal-Mart (WMT) (up 3.65%), Intel (INTC), McDonald (MCD) and Procter Gamble (PG) showed some strength.  Among the sub-indexes, the Dow Jones Transportation Average, the Amex Oil Index and the Dow Jones Utilities Average fell over 1% each, while the Amex Airline Index declined 6.50%. The Amex Biotechnology Index was off 1.94% compared to a 2.35% slide by the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index. In the technology space, hardware stocks came under selling pressure, with the Amex Disk Drive Index and the Amex Computer Hardware Index slipping 1.62% and 2.34%, respectively. On the other hand, the Amex Gold Bugs Index advanced 1.50%.  The major averages are finally showing some signs of moving out of the narrow ranges they have been locked in and are precariously close to testing their November lows. Volumes are also supporting a break below these levels and have been heavier on down days. The S&amp;P 500 Index has some strong support at current levels. If it breaches these levels, the next stop could be around its November lows of 750 and if this level is violated, the index could take another leg down and move towards the 626-673 area.  Obama is throttling up all efforts to unfreeze the credit markets and tackle the crisis facing the housing market. On Wednesday, Obama announced a plan valued at $75 billion to help homeowners avoid foreclosures, with the objective of working in a two-pronged way. The government is looking to assist homeowners, who are facing the risk of foreclosure by doling out incentives to lenders to modify the mortgage payments to make them more affordable.  Additionally, the government intends to help homeowners who are unable to refinance mortgages because of a steep decline in their home values through providing Freddie Mac (FRE) and Fannie Mae (FNM) with an additional $200 million in funding each.  Among the economic reports released yesterday, the Commerce Department said housing starts fell 16.8% month-over-month to 466,000. The reading is reflective of rising unemployment levels, piling house inventories and unfavorable financing conditions. Starts are now down 56.2% from last year and are off 79.5% from the peak seen in January 2006. Meanwhile, building permits, indicating future housing market activity, declined 4.8% compared to the previous month.  The Federal Reserve's industrial production report showed that output fell again, dropping 1.8% month-over-month in January. The previous month's production was revised down to a 2.4% decline from the originally estimated 2% drop. The decline was led by motor vehicle and parts production, which dropped 23.4%. Meanwhile, capacity utilization fell to 72% from a revised 73.3%. IHS Global Insight expects vehicle production to fall 10.4% in 2009, marking the first double-digit decline since 1975.  The minutes of the January FOMC meeting showed that the Fed officials foresee the risk of a delayed and weak recovery. The Fed lowered its GDP estimate for 2009 to a 0.5%-1.3% contraction from a 0.2% contraction to 1.1% positive growth and expects core PCE inflation rate to be between 0.9% and 1.1% in 2009. That said, the central bank raised its growth forecast for 2010 to 2.5%-3.3% from its previous forecast of 2.3%-3.2%. The FOMC members also seems to have reiterated their commitment to use the Fed's balance sheet to unfreeze the credit markets.  In his speech delivered yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke focused on the three sets of policy tools the Fed has been using, namely lending directly to financial institutions, providing liquidity to key credit markets and buying longer-term securities. In order to prevent the balance sheet expansion of the Fed from stoking inflationary pressures, Bernanke said the central bank has to moderate money supply growth and begin to raise the Fed funds rate when the economy begins to recover. Currency, Commodity Markets Crude oil futures are currently trading up $1.71 at $35.65 a barrel after ending Wednesday's session down $0.31 at $34.62 a barrel. With evidence mounting for a prolonged downturn, traders have been exiting positions, creating a widespread sell-off in the commodity.  Gold futures are currently trading up $4.30 at $982.50 an ounce. In the previous session, the commodity rose $9.70 to $978.20 an ounce. The precious metal has been strengthening in recent sessions due to a pick up in demand among traders who look upon the metal as a safe haven investment amid turbulent times.  On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 94.32 yen, stronger than the 93.79 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Wednesday. Against the euro, the dollar is trading at $1.2592. Asia Most stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region closed higher on value buying, but enthusiasm was tempered by lingering worries about the outlook for the global economy. Weak U.S. housing and industrial output data, and reminders of financial sector woes in Central and Eastern Europe restricted big gains. U.S. President Barack Obama's $75 billion lifeline to homeowners did little to allay concerns about the global economy. The Japanese market finished higher, buoyed by the Bank of Japan's decision to buy up to 1 trillion yen worth of corporate bonds. Exporters and automakers rose sharply, but overall gains in the broader market were marginal, as investors looked forward to the release of a few key economic reports from the U.S.  The Nikkei 225 index closed at 7,558, up 23 points or 0.31% and the Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 2 points or 0.3% to 752. Stocks of securities and electrical machinery companies showed notable gains, but marine transport, insurance and consumer finance stocks ended in the red.  Exporters rallied after the dollar climbed to a six-week high in the upper 93-yen level during Tokyo trading. The banking space revealed mixed sentiment. Oil-related stocks like Nippon Mining Holdings fell 5.11% and Showa Shell declined 0.73%. Japan Airlines fell 0.56% on reports that the airline is seeking about $2.1 billion in government loans.  In a significant development today, the Bank of Japan announced that it would keep interest rates unchanged at 0.1% following its February meeting. The decision to hold rates was adopted unanimously. The central bank also announced some measures to tackle what it perceives as severe financial and economic conditions.  The bank announced an extension of the duration of its corporate financing facility by 3 months at low interest rates. The duration as well as collateral for the outright purchase of commercial paper was extended. The bank also said it would begin outright purchases of up to 1 trillion yen worth of bank-held corporate bonds with credit ratings of A or higher that mature in a year's time.  The Australian market closed notably higher, buoyed by better-than-expected corporate earnings from companies such as Santos and Lihir Gold. The All Ordinaries index rose 31 points or 0.92% to 3,398.  Santos gained 1.26% after its profit before one-time items in 2008 grew 42 percent to A$572 million ($366 million). Likewise, Woodside Petroleum moved up 0.06% and Oil Search jumped 4.04%.  Banking stocks saw a comeback on value buying across the board, while media stocks closed mixed. Among gold miners, Newcrest Mining fell 1.10% and Lihir Gold moved down 0.84% despite reporting a $109.3 million full-year profit in 2008 compared to a loss in the previous year.  The South Korean market ended lower on renewed concerns about financial instability. Financials fell despite an announcement from South Korea's financial regulator about corporate restructuring plans for troubled companies. South Korea's benchmark KOSPI fell 14 points or 0.55% to 1,113.  In the banking space, Woori Finance fell 0.78%, Korea Exchange Bank declined 1.08% and KB Financial, the holding firm of Kookmin Bank lost 0.70%.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index opened lower and remained below the unchanged line for the bulk of the session before recovering in late trading. The index closed up merely 7.36 points or 0.06% at 13,023. Yue Yuen Industries, China Unicom, Wharf Holdings advanced strongly and helped offset losses among heavily weighted HSBC Holdings and China Mobile and utility and most property stocks. Europe The major European markets are trading higher on Thursday, with the French CAC 40 Index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index rising 0.41% and 0.99%, respectively, while the German DAX Index i...
