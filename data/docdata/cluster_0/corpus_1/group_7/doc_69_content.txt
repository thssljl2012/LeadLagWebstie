KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Malaysian shares may rise on Tuesday, extending gains from last week, as technical indicators point to improved upside momentum. Gains will however be limited as investors await news of financial rescue packages from U.S. lawmakers. Malaysia's main stock index rose 1.9 percent to 896.64 points last Friday led by banks on hopes for a U.S. financial recovery. Malaysia's financial markets were closed on Monday for a public holiday. 'The index is likely to extend gains especially if followed by strong buying momentum above the 900 psychological resistance level,' said TA Securities in its morning commentary. Traders should sell into rallies as the global economic outlook is far from certain, it said. Shares of Malaysia's national utility Tenaga Nasional may come under pressure after a top official said over the weekend that electricIty tariffs may be lowered by about 7-10 percent. A reduction in power tariffs without any corresponding cut in gas prices will hurt Tenaga's earnings. Here are the factors that may affect Malaysian stocks on Tuesday. ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 0050 GMT---- ------------ INSTRUMENT LAST PCT CHG NET CHG S&amp;P 500 869.89 0.15% 1.290 USD/JPY 91.23 -0.22% -0.200 10-YR US TSY YLD 2.9772 -- -0.011 SPOT GOLD 896.95 0.22% 1.950 US CRUDE 39.68 0.30% 0.120 DOW JONES 8270.87 -0.12% -9.72 ASIA ADRS 92.06 -0.51% -0.47 ----------------------------------------------------------------- &gt; Malaysia opposition party backs Anwar as leader &gt; Malaysia opposition reels after defections &gt; Malaysia police, opposition clash in disputed state &gt; IMF mulls new programmes for emerging markets &gt; Asia cbanks call for new world financial order &gt; Malaysia to cut power tariffs by 7-10 pct-report &gt; Telekom Malaysia says won't cut jobs, salaries &gt; Malaysia's Digi Q4 net profit 282.241 mln rgt &gt; Malaysia's c.bank reserves at $91.3 bln on Jan 30 &gt; Kuwait Finance Msia gets $300 m capital boost &gt; Malaysia readies mini-budget to restore growth &gt; Malaysia Dec exports, output to fall fastest in yrs &gt; Sime to pour $360m into water plan-paper &gt; Malaysia's c bank to submit new act to lawmakers &gt; Indonesia sees 5 pct rise in 2009 CPO output &gt; VEGOILS-Palm off 3-week highs as crude markets slide &gt; SE Asia Stocks - Earnings caution, CapitaLand hit S'pore &gt; Wall Street flat ahead of bank plan, stimulus &gt; Oil falls below $40 on demand concerns &gt; TREASURIES-Bonds mostly ease as traders stare at supply &gt; Dollar slips, investors look to US bank bailout &gt; Gold ends below $900/oz ahead of US stimulus plan (Reporting by Julie Goh; Editing by Kazunori Takada) Keywords: MARKETS MALAYSIA/STOCKS (julie.goh@thomsonreuters.com; +603-2333 8036; Reuters Messaging: julie.goh.reuters.com@reuters.net; Bureau Email: areuters@gmail.com) COPYRIGHT Copyright Thomson Reuters 2009.
