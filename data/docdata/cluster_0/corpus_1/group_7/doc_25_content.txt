NEW YORK - US stocks fell in choppy trading as the latest signs of labour market weakness and worries over the fate of major banks cut off a round of bargain-hunting and drove bank stocks to a 17-year low. The Dow industrials fell to within striking distance of fresh bear market lows. The US economy, stuck deep in recession, was hit by reports that showed the number of workers continuing to claim jobless benefits jumped to a record high in the first week of February and factory activity in the Mid-Atlantic region contracted sharply. 'The market is focusing right now in the financials and the stimulus and bailout packages,' said Rob Stein, managing partner at Astor Asset Management in Chicago. 'The market understands the position the banks are in. They might actually be insolvent but there is some value to their importance to the economy and what the Fed does from a bailout standpoint. Their price is reflecting that.' Bank of America and Citigroup plunged more than 12 per cent each on concerns about government plans to mop up bad assets from their books. The KBW banks index fell to its lowest level since 1992. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 47.07 points, or 0.62 per cent, to 7,508.56. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index shed 3.71 points, or 0.47 per cent, to 784.71. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 13.34 points, or 0.91 per cent, to 1,454.63. Earlier, bargain-hunting had helped support the market and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq had risen more than one per cent. A disappointing outlook from Hewlett-Packard Co pulled its stock down 8.3 per cent to $US31.25 ($A48.96), making the world's largest PC maker a top drag on the Dow and contributing to a decline in other big-cap technology shares like IBM, down 2.9 per cent. On Nasdaq, iPod maker Apple declined four per cent to $US90.61. On the upside, energy shares rose after data showed crude stockpiles fell unexpectedly last week and US crude futures jumped seven per cent. Chevron, up more than one per cent to $US66.81, was the top gainer on the Dow industrials. Another bright spot was Sprint Nextel, up about 27 per cent to $US3.44, as the third largest US mobile company posted a loss that was smaller than feared, despite shedding 1.3 million subscribers. The S&amp;P telecom services index gained 1.5 per cent.
