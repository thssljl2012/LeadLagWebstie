Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  THE share market was lower in noon trade as the banks and big miners reacted to an erratic US lead.  At 12.00pm (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 24.2 points, or 0.69 per cent, at 3484.4, while the broader All Ordinaries index fell 21.5 points, or 0.63 per cent, to 3424.2.  ABN Amro Morgans private client adviser Craig Walker said the decline was due to an erratic US lead overnight, depressing the big four banks and miners to weigh down the local market broadly.  'The Dow was jumping all over the place last night and ended up closing down, so no particularly strong leads for us today,'' he said.  'The mining sector as a whole has been a bit weak and gold was back below $US900 dollars overnight.  'Between the four majors, they've probably contributed ten negative points to the index.''  The big banks were all down.  Commonwealth Bank lost 34 cents to $29.60, Westpac fell 31 cents to $16.21, NAB declined 16 cents to $18.74 and ANZ slipped 25 cents to $12.21.  Resource stocks were also in negative territory.  Rio Tinto shed 3.06 per cent to $47.89, while rival BHP Billiton, the largest company on the Australian Securities Exchange fell 15 cents to $33.19.  The decline extended to local gold miners as the spot price of gold slipped to $US896.50 an ounce, down $US11.20 on Monday's local close of $US907.70 an ounce.  Among gold stocks Newcrest lost 30 cents to $31.90, Lihir fell 1.89 per cent to $3.11 and Sino Gold retreated 4.56 per cent to $4.81.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index contract was 19 points lower at 3447 on a volume of 10,047 contracts.
