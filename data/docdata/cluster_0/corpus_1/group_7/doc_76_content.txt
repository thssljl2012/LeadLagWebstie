The Australian stock market ended the week firmly in the red, pulled back by weakness in the banking sector following another negative lead from US markets overnight.  The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was off 46.5 points, or 1.4%, at 3402.4, taking the weekly losses to 4.4%. The broader All Ordinaries index shed 45 points, or 1.3%, to 3353.  Among the major sectors, financial stocks lost 2.2%, materials were down 1.1% and energy shed 1.7%.  The dollar was recently trading at 63.93 US cents, slightly lower than yesterday, and 60.2 yen and 50.80 euro cents.  Mr Potter said Asian markets were significantly weaker on Friday, 'all pointing towards a very interesting session on Wall Street tonight''.  He said Macquarie Infrastructure Group was a poor performer on the local bourse after brokers UBS and ABN Amro cut the toll road operator's target price to $1.70 and $2.52, respectively.  Macquarie Infrastructure Group shares were down 11.5 cents, or 8.5%, at $1.24.  The major banks were all weaker. National Australia Bank gave up 39 cents, or 2.1%, to $18.01 as it said its former head of Australian operations, Ahmed Fahour, would cease to be a member of the board and executive committee.  Commonwealth Bank shed 28 cents to $29.57, Westpac retreated 62 cents to $16.38 and ANZ slipped 15 cents to $12.45.  ANZ chief executive Mike Smith says he expects rising debt among retail customers in the second half of this year and early 2010 as unemployment rises.  The mining giants were mixed. BHP Billiton was up 35 cents at $30.51 while debt-laden rival Rio Tinto dropped $1.49 to $50.29.
