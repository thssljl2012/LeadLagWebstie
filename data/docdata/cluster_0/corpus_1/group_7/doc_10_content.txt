(Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei stock average slipped 0.3 percent, erasing earlier gains as the yen climbed against the euro and amid growing uncertainty about a U.S. bank rescue plan. Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) surged over 6 percent after it announced drastic steps on Monday to cope with the recession, saying it would cut 20,000 jobs and joining a growing list of automakers warning of red ink this year.
