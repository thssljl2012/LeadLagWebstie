AUSTRALIAN shares closed at a new five-year low yesterday for the second time this week, defying a strong rebound on Wall Street.  After spiking 1.5 per cent at the opening bell, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 retreated to finish in negative territory for the fourth consecutive day and at its lowest point in the current bear market.   Traders said investors were sceptical of the US rally and unnerved by grim economic data from Japan and Hong Kong. 'The market does not believe big moves in the Dow,' said Anthony Anderson, senior client adviser at MF Global Australia.   The benchmark index closed down 4.1 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 3327.5, while the All Ordinaries was down 3.5 points to 3281.5.   Most markets around the world -- equities, base metals and crude oil -- were higher following Wall Street's rebound from 12-year lows after Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke eased worries over banks and the economy.   The Australian dollar closed above US65c for the first time in almost two weeks on Dr Bernanke's positive comments. The Aussie was trading at US65.12c, up from Tuesday's close of US64.78c.   Dr Bernanke told a senate banking committee overnight that nationalisation of major investment banks would not be necessary to ensure their viability.   He also said the worst recession in decades should end this year, so long as the actions taken by the Government resulted in some stability in financial markets.   But Goldman Sachs JBWere senior sales trader Patrick Crabb said the US rally had failed to erase all of Monday's losses and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was still down about 14 points over the two days. Barack Obama's address to both houses of Congress yesterday afternoon also had little impact on the market.   While the US President's speech was upbeat, he did not provide any new information, said Mr Crabb.   Pacific Brands shares led decliners on the ASX 200 index after the owner of Bonds and Berlei brands announced plans to slash 1850 jobs and shut factories.   Pacific Brands plunged 37.1 per cent to 22c.   Also among the day's 10 worst performers was Goodman Group, which dived 18.3 per cent to 24.5c after it reported a bigger than forecast fall in half-year net profit.   Embattled miner Oz Minerals lost 15.4 per cent to 50c on fears that the Chinese bid to stop it from going under could stall.   Gold miners were poor performers on the day after the spot price of gold in Sydney fell $US23.25, or 2.4 per cent, to $US964.50 per fine ounce.   Newcrest Mining lost 5.1 per cent to $31.29, Newmont fell 6 per cent to $6.25 and Lihir shed 3.46percent to $3.35.   The Big Four banks were led lower by National Australia Bank, which fell 1.3 per cent to $17.30. ANZ was down 1 per cent to $12.50, Westpac eased 0.4 per cent to $16.18 and Commonwealth Bank slipped 0.4 per cent to $29.13. Macquarie Bank lost 2.8 per cent to $18.48.   Seven Network rose 2.4 per cent to $5.63 despite reporting an 84 per cent fall in first-half profit after writing down the value of its investments due to declining financial and advertising markets.   AGL Energy reaffirmed its full-year guidance after delivering an increase in profit. AGL lost 1.2 per cent to $13.25.
