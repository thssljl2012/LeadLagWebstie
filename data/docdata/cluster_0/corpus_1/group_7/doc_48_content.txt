TOKYO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average slid 2   percent on Monday as fears that some U.S. banks may be   nationalised added to uncertainty about the financial sector and   as slumping global demand hurt exporters like Sony Corp.   Mizuho Financial Group dropped nearly 6 percent   after Japan's No.2 bank said it will issue $850 million in   preferred securities to shore up its depleted capital base.   'It seems like it's a matter of time until the exporter-heavy   Nikkei 225, which had been supported by the currency, will test   the last year's lows -- it could go as early as this week,' said   Takahiko Murai, general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities.   'The problem now is that the weaker yen cannot make up for   the loss of sales from exports.'   The benchmark Nikkei declined 151.28 points to   7,265.10, after booking on Friday its lowest close since Oct. 27.   It booked an intraday low level of 6,994.90 on Oct. 28, its   lowest since 1982.   The broader Topix, which posted on Friday its lowest   finish in 25 years, shed 1.8 percent to 726.15.   Fears that the U.S. government may be forced to nationalise   some big banks pushed the Dow industrials to a 6-1/2-year low,   also pushing Japanese banks stocks lower.   Mizuho Financial tumbled 5.9 percent to 177 yen and top   lender Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group dropped 4.2   percent to 411 yen.   Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group declined 5.4 percent   to 2,805 yen.   SFCG, a lender to smaller companies, was awash with   sell orders after filed for bankruptcy protection with 338   billion yen ($3.6 billion) in debt.   The price was indicated at 1,092 yen, or down 15.5 percent   from Friday's close.   Exporters fell though the yen remained above 93 yen   against the dollar. Investors usually welcome a softer yen as it   boosts exporters' profits when repatriated.   Sony lost 4.7 percent to 1,513 yen and TDK Corp gave   up 4.7 percent to 3,220 yen. Honda Motor Co skidded 3.3   percent to 2,170 yen. aiko.hayashi.reuters.com@reuters.net; +81 3 6441 1802))
