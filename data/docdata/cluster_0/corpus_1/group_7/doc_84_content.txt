SINGAPORE, Feb 10 (Reuters) - CapitaLand, Southeast Asia's largest developer, surged as much as 8.9 percent on Tuesday after analysts said its planned S$1.84 billion rights issue would give it the financial flexibility for acquisitions.  Bank of America-Merill Lynch upgraded CapitaLand to 'buy' from 'underperform' following the rights call, saying it would put CapitaLand in a good position for opportunistic buys.  A local dealer added that some investors were buying back the stock 'on fact' after selling them during the past three weeks amid rumours of a pending rights issue.  CapitaLand said on Monday announced a 1-for-2 rights issue and said quarterly net profit fell 88 percent. .  At 0354 GMT, shares of CapitaLand were up 6.8 percent at S$2.53 while the benchmark Straits Times Index gained 0.42 percent.
