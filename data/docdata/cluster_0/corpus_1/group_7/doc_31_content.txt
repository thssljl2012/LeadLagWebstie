Reports showing a record high in the number of workers continuing to claim jobless benefits in the first week of February and sharp contraction in factory activity in the Mid-Atlantic region depicted an economy in deep recession.  Bank of America (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N) plunged 7 percent and nearly 10 percent each on concerns about government plans to mop up bad assets from their books. The KBW banks index .BKX fell to its lowest since 1992.  'I think that conviction is in the process of breaking,' said said Chip Hanlon, president of Delta Global Advisors, Inc in Huntington Beach, CA.  'If that's the case, then I think you could look for a whoosh to the downside.'  Losses were cushioned by energy shares that gained along with the price of oil CLc1, which jumped nearly 10 percent after government data showed a surprise fall in crude inventories last week. Chevron (CVX.N) was the Dow's biggest boost, up 1.6 percent at $67.15.  The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was off 39.34 points, or 0.52 percent, to 7,516.29. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index .SPX lost 2.41 points, or 0.31 percent, to 786.01. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 9.37 points, or 0.64 percent, at 1,458.60.  Since the start of the year, the Dow has fallen more than 14 percent, while the S&amp;P 500 has lost more than 12 percent. The losses put the Dow on track to break the bear market closing lows hit on Nov. 20.  Bargain-hunting helped put a floor under the market and earlier pushed the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq up more than 1 percent.  A disappointing outlook from Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) pulled its stock down 9.7 percent to $30.76, making the world's largest PC maker a top drag on the Dow and contributing to a decline in other big-cap technology shares such as IBM (IBM.N), down 2.9 percent at $88.98.
