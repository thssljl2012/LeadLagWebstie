US crude oil supplies have risen for seven consecutive weeks. Oil prices have risen to above $34 a barrel despite concerns about weakness in the US economy, which continue to cast a shadow over the commodity.   Analysts fear rising US unemployment will hit demand for oil.  The global slowdown has seen oil prices fall more than $110 off the highs seen in July last year.  US light, sweet crude rose 60 cents to $34.58 a barrel in Asia, having tumbled $1.96 in New York to settle at $33.98. London Brent rose $1.34 to $45.99. 'The economic indicators in the developed world remain weak and that's impinging on oil demand,' said David Moore, a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. 'It's premature to say the fall in demand has bottomed.' Weak demand   Earlier this week, the Energy Information Administration reported a seventh consecutive weekly increase in nationwide crude oil stocks as the economic crisis crushed business and consumer demand for fuel.  And rising unemployment has led to further fears of weakening demand for oil among US consumers.  New claims for unemployment benefit remain close to record highs.  The US jobless rate rose to 7.6% in January, up from 7.2% in December, according to official figures - the highest level since 1992.  The rapid rise in unemployment suggests the US recession is deepening.  Members of both houses of Congress have agreed a stimulus package, now worth $789bn (549bn), including tax cuts and spending aimed at rescuing the US economy.  But analysts have questioned how much the oil price will benefit from it, with reduced production more likely to raise prices. 'We're at the point where you start to see marginal producers have to shut down production,' said Peter Elston, a strategist with Aberdeen, a fund manager in Singapore. 'That gives you quite good support for prices.'
