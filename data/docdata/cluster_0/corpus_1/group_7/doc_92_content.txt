 THE share market was marginally lower in early trade as the gold miners fell after the price of the precious metal declined overnight.  Stocks of companies with large US based businesses also declined because of delays in the US government's rescue bill.  At 10.25am (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 6.3 points, or 0.18 per cent, at 3502.3, while the broader All Ordinaries index fell 4.7 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 3441.1.  Macquarie Equities associate director Lucinda Chan said investors were reluctant to trade stocks before the US stimulus package became more certain. 'Everyone still is waiting for more details from the US,'' she said.  That uncertainty, and concern about the US economy's performance had hurt stocks which have a large portion of their business there, Ms Chan said. 'People still look towards the US because it is the biggest economy.''   Ms Chan also said the gold miners had fallen after the price of the metal fell.  Following the gold price is 'much the trend in the gold miners,'' she said.   Newcrest was down 1.09 per cent to $31.85, Lihir declined 2.21 per cent to $3.10 and Sino Gold retreated 3.77 per cent to $4.85.   The spot price of gold was $US893.95 an ounce, down $US13.75 on Monday's local close of $US907.70 an ounce.  Resources were down.   BHP Billiton fell 11 cents to $33.23, while Rio Tinto slipped 1.86 per cent to $48.48.   The big banks were mixed.  Commonwealth Bank added 5 cents to $29.99, Westpac fell 21 cents to $16.31, NAB declined 9 cents to $18.81 and ANZ slipped 17 cents to $12.29.  Companies with large exposures to the US consumer market fell before a speech by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner outlining President Barack Obama's plan to overhaul the Government's $US700 billion ($1 trillion) . Republicans and Democrats have been at odds over the plan, which is designed to help pull the economy out of the worst recession in decades.  Among other big traders, Westfield fell 2.21 per cent to $11.05, Brambles lost 1.59 per cent to $6.17, James Hardie declined 1.39 per cent to $3.56 and News Corporation (the parent company of the publisher of news.com.au) dropped 1.96 per cent, to $11.03.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index contract was one point lower at 3465 on a volume of 4920 contracts.
