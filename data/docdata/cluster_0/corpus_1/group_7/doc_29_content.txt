By Simone Giuliani MELBOURNE, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Australian stocks gained 0.5 percent on Thursday, breaking a four-session losing streak, as Woodside Petroleum led an advance in oil producers that helped offset the impact of more company earnings downgrades. The top banks were also broadly firmer, despite Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd breaking ranks to become the first of the big four to announce a dividend cut. 'There is no broad theme that has drifted over the market,' said Justin Gallagher, head of Sydney sales trading at ABN AMRO. 'It has been more stock or sector specific.' The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 index rose 18 points to end at 3,345.5, based on the latest available data, after posting five-year closing lows earlier in the week. New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index fell 0.1 percent, or 2.4 points, to 2,497.4. Oil producers rallied after a 6 percent jump in crude prices. Woodside Petroleum gained 5.3 percent to A$35.98 while Santos Ltd added 3.7 percent to A$15.01 and Beach Petroleum Ltd climbed 7.7 percent to 84 Australian cents. Telstra Corp Ltd cut its 2009 fiscal year earnings outlook, helping to send its shares down 2.4 percent to A$3.68. The group also announced the departure of its controversial chief executive Sol Trujillo. Origin Enery Ltd shares lost 1 percent to A$13.20 after it joined the list of companies cutting full year forecasts as the economic outlook deteriorates. ANZ Bank rose 4.4 percent to A$13.05, despite saying it would cut its full-year dividend by about a quarter and post flat profit growth due to rising bad debt charges. Analysts and investors said the dividend cut was a prudent move that would remove the need for a capital increase. Other banks also gained, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia rising 2.3 percent to A$29.80, Westpac Banking Corp up 2.9 percent to A$16.65 and National Australia Bank Ltd adding 1 percent to A$17.51. Gallagher said there was an increasing expectation that a ban on short selling of financial stocks, due to be lifted March 6, would be kept in place. Toll Holdings Ltd, Australia's top logistics group, surged 13.3 percent to A$5.29 after reporting an 11 percent rise in first-half profit from continuing operations and saying it expected a strong second half.. Macquarie Group Ltd fell 5.4 percent to A$17.49, after earlier hitting a 10-year low of A$16.25. It responded to market speculation with an announcement that it had no current plans for a capital raising. ((melbourne.newsroom@reuters.com; +613-9286-1421))
