At 1204 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 82 points, or 2.37 per cent, at 3,382.3, while the broader All Ordinaries index had plunged 75.4 points, or 2.21 per cent, to 3,336.8.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange at 1204 AEDT, the March share price index futures contract had shed 90 points to 3,351 on a volume of 14,024 contracts.  CommSec market analyst Savanth Sebastian said the local market had been heavily weighed down by continuing bleak economic news from the US.  Local investors were punishing companies with poor earnings results, Mr Sebastian said.  A prime example was fund manager Perpetual, which reported an 84 per cent slump in first half profit due to direct impacts of the financial crisis.  Its shares were down $1.25, or 4.8 per cent, to $24.80 at 1206 AEDT.  Mr Sebastian said even a positive result from Woodside Petroleum had failed to inspire the market because macroeconomic indicators pointed to ongoing weakness in commodity prices, including oil.  Australia's second largest oil and gas producer posted a 73 per cent jump in full year profit on stronger production and commodity prices.  Woodside's shares had given up 58 cents, or 1.79 per cent, to $31.82 at 1208 AEDT while Santos had fallen 36 cents, or 2.46 per cent, to $14.29 and Oil Search had slid 16 cents, or 3.43 per cent, to $4.50. 'Base metal prices were significantly weaker overnight, sending resource stocks down three per cent' in late morning trade, Mr Sebastian said.  The diversified mining giants were sharply lower. BHP Billiton had dropped $1.32, or 4.16 per cent, to $30.40 at 1209 AEDT, while debt-laden rival Rio Tinto had retreated $2.14, or 4.27 per cent, to $47.93.  Among the major banks, National Australia Bank had sunk 34 cents to $17.54 at 1210 AEDT, Commonwealth Bank had shed 66 cents to $28.35, Westpac had lost 44 cents to $16.34 and ANZ was down 19 cents to $12.23.  Mr Sebastian expected financial stocks would continue to track lower this afternoon.  In the news on Wednesday, Insurance Australia Group has gone into a trading halt at $3.46 as it undertakes a fully underwritten institutional placement.  Mining contractor and civil engineer Macmahon Holdings has reported a 40.5 per cent fall in half year net profit to $14.1 million and cut its dividend, but remains positive on the outlook for the construction sector.
