(Adds Asciano)  MELBOURNE, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 1.9 percent on Wednesday, led by top global miner BHP Billiton , after copper and oil prices fell on more signs of a deepening global recession.

STOCKS ON THE MOVE  * Port and rail operator Asciano  jumped 17 percent to A$0.65, reversing a 19 percent slide over the previous two days, on speculation it might be close to reaching a deal, either involving its Pacific National coal business or even a complete takeover. The company declined to comment on the speculation. 'The stock is getting so cheap, it's getting pretty attractive for a full takeover offer,' said Will Seddon, an analyst with White Funds Management, adding that value investors might have been coming back into the stock on Wednesday.  0400 GMT  * Mining services group Macmahon Holdings  fell 14 percent to A$0.335 after reporting a 41 percent slide in first-half net profit and slicing its first-half dividend by a quarter to 1.5 cents a share.  0130 GMT * BHP Billiton , the world's biggest global miner, and rival Rio Tinto  both fell around 4 percent after the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index , a global commodities benchmark, slumped to a 6- year low. 0130 GMT * Westpac shares fell 2.9 percent to A$16.30, after reporting bad debts had jumped more than five times in the first quarter.
