THE Australian share market closed modestly stronger thanks to gains in the financial, energy and industrial sectors. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 index was up 18 points, or 0.54 per cent, at 3,345.5, while the broader All Ordinaries index rose 15.9 points, or 0.48 per cent, to 3,297.4.   On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was down six points to 3,315 on a volume of 21,932 contracts.   CommSec market analyst Juliette Saly said the local bourse had a choppy start after a negative lead from Wall Street but picked up around midday. ANZ has forecast its dividends could be slashed this year by up to 25 per cent, Ms Saly said. That is, of course, going to set a nasty precedent for other banks to possibly follow suit. ANZ was up 55 cents, or 4.4 per cent, at $13.05 after saying its unaudited net profit fell 11 per cent in the first four months of its fiscal 2009 to the end of January.   The bank also said cash earnings for the period, excluding provisions and credit intermediation trades, were up 18 per cent on the corresponding period.   National Australia Bank added 18 cents to $17.51, Commonwealth Bank found 67 cents to $29.80 and Westpac rose 47 cents to $16.65.   The big diversified miners were mixed. BHP BillitonRio Tinto was up 12 cents at $46.30.   Shares in Fortesque Metals Group fell 27 cents, or 9.54 per cent, to $2.56 after coming out of a three-day trading halt.   The iron ore miner announced after market close on Wednesday that it had scrapped a plan to raise about $500 million from institutional investors.   Freight distributor Toll Holdings reported a first half net profit of $158 million, down 33 per cent on the previous corresponding period.   Shares in Toll were up 62 cents, or 13.28 per cent, at $5.29.   AAP
