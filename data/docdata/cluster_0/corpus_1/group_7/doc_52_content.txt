Financial stocks were leading a moderate pullback on Wall Street as investors looked for clues about the economy after two back-and-forth days in the market.  The market was awaiting a second day of testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke before Congress. Investors were also waiting for January home sales figures to be released early in the session.  Bank stocks have been falling amid continuing uneasiness about the steps the government will take to help struggling financial companies.  Still, some pullback was to be expected after stocks shot higher Tuesday following Bernanke's reassurances about the economy and the banking industry.  Abroad on Wednesday, financial stocks led European exchanges up in early trade while Asian stocks gained on word that there are no U.S. bank nationalization plans.  Bernanke on Tuesday said the U.S. government had no plan to fully nationalize any of the country's distressed banks.  In testimony to the Senate Banking Committee, Bernanke also said the recession could pass by the end of the year.  One analyst said the Fed chairman's statement was heartening to equity holders in banks.
