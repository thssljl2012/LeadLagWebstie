(Adds broker comment)  By Sonali Paul  MELBOURNE, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 1.5 percent on Wednesday, led by top global miner BHP Billiton Ltd , after copper and oil prices fell on more signs of a deepening global recession.  European banking woes and a weak manfucturing report from New York state along with more profit warnings and weak results from Australian companies all drove the market's losses. 'The outlook's so shocking. All economic numbers everywhere are so bad, it's very, very diffiuclt to see this market making any headway in the near term,' said David Spry, research manager for broker FW Holst.  A late upturn for two of the top four banks and global miner Rio Tinto  helped pull the market off its low of the day.  The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200  shed 51.1 points to close at 3,413.2, according to the latest data, extending the market's fall so far this week to 4.1 percent. It had touched a low for the day of 3,368.1.  New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index  fell 1.9 percent to 2,621.0.  BHP Billiton, the world's biggest global miner, slid 4.5 percent to A$30.31, after the Reuters-Jefferies CRB index , a global commodities benchmark, slumped to a 6- year low.  However its rival Rio Tinto  ended the day up 1 percent at A$50.55, despite shareholders no longer being eligible for its dividend.  Westpac Banking Corp , Australia's second-largest bank, fell 1.8 percent to A$16.48 after reporting bad debts had jumped more than five times in the first quarter. For more, click on [ID:nSYD415493]. Fortescue Metals  jumped as much as 26 percent and ended up 12 percent at A$2.99, valuing the group at A$8.4 billion ($5.4 billion), after it revealed it had held talks with global miner Anglo American and China's sovereign wealth fund, China Investment Corp.

Woodside Petroleum , Australia's second-largest oil and gas producer, rebounded to end the day up 3.4 percent A$33.50 after reassuring investors it would not need to raise equity to help fund an LNG project.

Port and rail operator Asciano  jumped 17 percent to A$0.65, reversing a 29 percent slide over the previous two days, on speculation it might be close to reaching a deal, either involving its Pacific National coal business or even a complete takeover. The company declined to comment on the speculation. 'The stock is getting so cheap, it's getting pretty attractive for a full takeover offer,' said Will Seddon, an analyst with White Funds Management, adding that value investors might have been coming back into the stock on Wednesday.  Mining services group Macmahon Holdings  fell 14 percent to A$0.335 after reporting a 41 percent slide in first-half net profit and slicing its first-half dividend by a quarter to 1.5 cents a share. Centennial Coal  slid 22 percent to A$1.85 after saying it expected its second half earnings to match its first half, well below market forecasts.  Sugar and building products conglomerate CSR Ltd  fell 17 percent to a more than six-year low of A$1.24 after it slashed its full year earnings forecast due to a sharp slump in construction activity in the past three months.
