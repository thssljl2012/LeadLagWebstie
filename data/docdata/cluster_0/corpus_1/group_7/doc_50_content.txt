JOHANNESBURG, Feb 9 (Reuters) - South Africa's rand regained ground against the dollar on Monday after falling over 2 percent against the dollar earlier in the session, as uncertainty over bailout plans for the U.S. bank sector left the greenback on the back foot.   The resource-heavy domestic bourse rose, adding to Friday's rally, as platinum shares continued to gain.  The Johannesburg Top-40 index of blue-chip stocks closed 1.34 percent higher at 19,685.16 points. The wider All-share index was up 1.16 percent to 21,685.10 points. 'The resources are driving us, especially platinum stocks are doing very well,' Barend Saayman, a trader at Thebe Securities said.  The JSE platinum index was up 6.04 percent, led by Impala Platinum which rose 7.25 percent to 132.45 rand and Anglo Platinum increased 4.32 percent to 459 rand.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd gained 3.92 percent to 271.74 rand, despite reporting a fourth-quarter adjusted headline loss per share of 5 U.S. cents, and mining group Exxaro Resource rose 2.84 percent to 72.50 rand. 'I think a lot of people are still trying to make up their minds about where the market is going to head to in the coming session' said Andrew Todd, a trader at BOE Private Clients.  At 1553 GMT the rand traded 0.04 percent firmer at 9.5575 to the dollar, after plunging earlier to 9.7845. The currency ended Friday's session at 9.5590.  The dollar weakened across the board, downed by growing uncertainty over U.S. plans for a massive fiscal stimulus and a much-anticipated package to help struggling banks hit by a global financial crisis. 'We have seen quite a lot of dollar weakness across the board. We are obviously looking at the euro and the pound at a hell of a lot higher levels than what we were seeing (earlier),' said RMB rand trader Brigid Taylor. 'The dollar just remains on the back foot, I think it's sentiment around concerns about the bailout plans. Ultimately I think people are looking for some serious direction in terms of how they are going to stimulate the (U.S.) economy.' 'If the rand closes below 9.63 then we'll open quite nicely on the downside, towards the 9.30 level. The risk remains around what the outcome of these bailout packages is going to be,' Taylor added. Despite the troubles besetting their U.S. counterparts, South African banks and insurance stocks fared well on Monday.  African Bank Investments Ltd increased 5.56 percent to 28.50 rand and investment bank Investec -- which is also listed in London -- rose 3.26 percent to 37.38 rand. Absa Group gained 1.77 percent to 100.75 rand after it lifted annual profit.  Insurer Old Mutual, which also has a London listing, was up 3.98 percent to 9.15 rand, while petrochemicals group Sasol rose 5.51 percent to 297 rand and paper maker Sappi added 4.73 percent to 31 rand.  South African government bonds rallied on Monday, and inversely, yields headed southwards, with the 2015 bond yield falling 5 basis points to 7.565 percent, while the yield on the R209 note due in 2036 shed a basis point to 7.86 percent.
