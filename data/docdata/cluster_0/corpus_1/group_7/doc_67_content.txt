The Dow Jones industrial average fell 80.05 points, or 1.09 percent, to 7,270.89. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index dropped 8.24 points, or 1.07 percent, to 764.90.

Reuters Messaging: rodrigo.campos.reuters.com@reuters.net 1731 ET 25Feb2009-Fear gauge down as S&amp;P 500 support holds ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The CBOE Volatility Index, the implied volatility measure of the S&amp;P 500, was off 1.80 percent to 44.67. The VIX moved lower for the second straight session, breaking below the 21-day and 50-day moving averages, toward the two-month supporting trend line, said Scott Fullman, direcetor of derivative investment strategy at WJB Capital Group. The index, which measures implied volatility/risk premium, is heading back toward the lower end of the recent short-term trading range. 'Technical oscillators are negative and the short-term directional momentum indicators are nearing a negative signal,' he said. The fact that the S&amp;P support level held just below 750/760, has limited some of the upside in spot VIX. Thus, the 38-52 range appears fitting with price action. Actual volatility levels remain in the high thirties; and this also adds a 'floor' of sorts to the VIX, said Larry McMillan, president of McMillan Analysis Corp in a note. Reuters Messaging: doris.frankel.reuters.com@reuters.net 1555 ET 25Feb2009-Gov't attempts to stop consolidation will spur volatility ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Stocks will remain volatile because government programs attempts to stymie the natural consolidation pressures that always follow a bubble, wrote Rich Bernstein, chief investment strategist for Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. 'The history of bubbles shows quite definitively that consolidation is inevitable across a broad range of industries, Bernstein wrote in a note on Wednesday. 'Financial markets are unlikely to respond positively until programs are put in place that attempt to manage that inevitable process rather than attempt to stop it.'
