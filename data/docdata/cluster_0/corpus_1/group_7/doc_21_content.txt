Nearest March VIX futures was at 44.35. The two indexes often trade inversely. The VIX tracks projected stock market volatility embedded in near-term S&amp;P 500 option prices. This indicates that traders expect the S&amp;P 500 to hold the 750/760 lows and that a significant expansion in the price range in the S&amp;P 500 is not expected, said Larry McMillan, president of McMillan Analysis Corp in a note. He said this assumption proved erroneous and expensive last year and while the near-term oversold condition is building and may be providing traders with some comfort with regards to expecting a bounce to occur -- quite often oversold conditions can become a lot more extreme than expected before any such 'bounce' occurs.
