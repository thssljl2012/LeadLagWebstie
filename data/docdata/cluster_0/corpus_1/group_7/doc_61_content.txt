TOKYO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.5 percent on Monday to a four-month closing low on fears about U.S. bank nationalisation, but a report that the U.S. government may raise its stake in Citigroup pared earlier losses. The failure of SFCG, a high-interest lender to smaller companies, underscored worries about tightening credit hitting businesses throughout the Japanese economy and sent shares in rival firms such as Takefuji Corp tumbling. The benchmark Nikkei lost 40.22 points to 7,376.16, its lowest close since Oct 27, after earlier falling as far as 7,209.43 -- in sight of the 26-year low of 6994.90 hit on Oct. 28. The broader Topix fell 0.6 percent to a 25-year closing low for the second day in a row, hitting 735.28.
