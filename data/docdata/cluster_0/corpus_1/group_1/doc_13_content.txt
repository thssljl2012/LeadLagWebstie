 FALLS in commodity prices and a rise in US financials generated weakness in materials and energy stocks, leaving the share market flat at the close yesterday. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 closed at 4981.7 after rising from 4950.3 to 4999.5 in quiet trading before the weekend. Activity remained dominated by speculative accounts 'switching' between financials and resources. In the resources sector, BHP Billiton fell 1.9 per cent to $37.98, Rio Tinto fell 2.4 per cent to $115.15, Woodside fell 2.5 per cent to $54.20 and Newcrest was down 2.5 per cent to $24.43. Among financials, Westpac rose 1.4 per cent to $22.80, CBA rose 0.5 per cent to $43.70, ANZ rose 1.1 per cent to $16.90 and Westfield was up 2.5 per cent to $16.25, while NAB decreased 0.6 per cent to $25.05. The index finished below last week's closing level of 4986.2, failing to build significantly on last week's bullish pattern. 'We definitely see more downside risk,' said head of Sydney sales trading at ABN AMRO, Justin Gallagher. Mr Gallagher said it was a bit strange that the US market rose on Thursday despite US CPI rising to 0.8 per cent in July, nearly twice market expectations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7 per cent as General Motors climbed 11 per cent after unveiling its Chevy Volt electric car and financials recovered as JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley agreed to buy back more than $US7 billion in auction rate securities from clients as part of an agreement to end a regulatory probe. But traders were worried about the outlook for US financials after JPMorgan this week took writedowns for the third quarter and warned that consumer provisions for credit losses could increase substantially. 'I can't get excited about the market,' said a senior trader at a major brokerage. 'I think there's more bad news to come out on the (US) financials as the credit crunch moves from sub-prime to home equity lines of credit, credit cards and auto loans.' Apart from switching after reacting to overnight moves in commodity prices and US banks, investors were buying Telstra before its upcoming dividend payment. Testra rose 3.8 per cent to $4.42. Suncorp-Metway rose 7.9 per cent to $12.44 as traders thought it could make sense for the Commonwealth Bank and QBE to bid for Suncorp. 'The market's really started to get interested in this rumour now,' said head of Melbourne sales trading at Goldman Sachs JBWere Patrick Crabb. 'It's an old rumour, but perhaps there's a bit more in it.' Commonwealth Bank, QBE and Suncorp officials declined to comment. Separately, Tolhurst senior private client adviser Peter Morgan said Suncorp 'is absolutely cheap. Core earnings are a lot higher than the market is giving it credit for and that's why it's able to maintain its dividend of 55c'. Mr Morgan expected the resources sector to find temporary support from a good result and outlook statements from BHP Billiton, which reports on Monday. He added that the prospect of an interest rate cut next month was a positive factor for the financial sector because it would cushion the slowdown in the Australian economy and boost the relative attractiveness of the fully franked dividend yield on offer by the major banks. However, he said the US sub-prime crisis posed an ongoing risk for global stock markets. Also, with Babcock &amp;amp; Brown hitting record lows, traders said banks could be weighed down by investor concern about their exposure to Babcock &amp;amp; Brown's debts. 'It (Babcock) is a bugbear for banks,' said Tolhurst's Mr Morgan. Dow Jones Newswires
