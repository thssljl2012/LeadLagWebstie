 with Brazilian stocks ending lower as resource heavweights came under pressure. Brazil's Bovespa fell 0.2% to 55,850.13, but finished off its lowest levels. The benchmark index closed up 3% for the week. Shares of Petrobras (PBR) ended 0.3% lower but fell as much as 2.7% as crude- oil prices dropped, by more than $6 to $114 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as the dollar strengthened against its major competitors. The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, rose 0.7% to 76.74. Metals stocks weighed, with miner Vale (RIO) down 1.8%, and Usiminas off 1.5% as prices for silver, copper, gold and other metals slumped. The market had moved slightly higher earlier in the session after inflation through mid-August eased back more than had been anticipated by economists. The consumer price index, known as the IPCA, rose 0.35% compared with a rise of 0.63% through mid-July, according to the IBGE statistics agency. Economists had expected the rate to come in at 0.38%, according to a note Friday from Latin American analysts at Barclays Capital Research. A fall in food, beverages and fuel prices contributed to the mid-month result. 'We should see further deceleration in consumer inflation, still supported by easing food inflation,' said Barclays, with an increase in the IPCA near 0.30% in August. 'Also, we expect low inflation numbers in September, around August's figures.' Earlier this week, Barclays revised its yearly inflation forecast to 6.7% from 7%, as 'moderating forces' including monetary policy and the external environments 'are poised to contain domestic demand growth.' The upper-limit of Brazil's inflation target is 6.5%. Guido Mantega, Brazil's finance minister, said Wednesday that the benchmark interest rate won't be pulled lower until inflation moves back toward its 4.5% target rate. The Selic rate now stands at 13%. News of cooling inflation in Brazil arrived at the same time that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said that inflation was on track to moderate in coming months, considering the recent pullback in commodity prices and the dollar as well as slowing growth. Bernanke made the comments at the Fed's annual retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Meanwhile, economic growth in Mexico has slowed more than expected by economists. The country's statistics agency said late Thursday that gross domestic product rose 2.8%, up from 2.6% growth in the first quarter, but below expectations of GDP growth of 3.1%. But Mexico's IPC bounced up 1.3% to 26,875.45. Market heavyweight America Movil (AMX) rose 2.4% and was among the strongest price performers of session. Wal-Mart de Mexico (WMMVY) shares rose 2.2% and retailer Soriana picked up 1.4%. Copper miner Grupo Mexico shares, meanwhile, slipped 0.5%. The IPC finished down 0.5% on a weekly basis. Argentina's Merval closed up 0.9% at 1,759.07 on Friday, and Chile's IPSA rose 0.5% to 2,839.65. For the week, the Merval posted a 1.4% gain while the IPSA fell 1.9%.
