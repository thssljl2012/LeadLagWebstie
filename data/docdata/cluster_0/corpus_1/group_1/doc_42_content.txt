 U.S. stocks on Thursday opened sharply lower after the government said jobless claims climbed last week, insurer  reported a large loss, and  sale results weighed on sentiment. 'Weekly jobless claims have not been kind of late, [and] WalMart's same-store sales are a disappointment, which is raising some concerns about the consumer's health,' said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 150.63 points to 11,505.44, the losses paced by AIG , which fell 13.8%, after the insurance giant reported $5.36 billion in mortgage-related losses. The S&amp;amp;P 500 shed 14.63 points to 1,274.56, and the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite declined 20.28 points to 2,358.09. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil futures gained, with crude for September delivery recently up $2.37 at $120.95 a barrel. . Retailers also deepened investors' gloom, with most reporting worse-than- forecast same-store sales for July, with Wal-Mart Stores , the world's largest retailer, among those missing targets. Ahead of the opening bell, the Labor Department reported the count of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week climbed to 455,000, its highest level in more than six years. . Overseas, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank both held rates unchanged. In overseas trade, European shares edged higher, with the pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index up 0.2% to 288.27. . In Asia, stocks closed on a mostly weak note, with Japan's Nikkei 225 Averaage down 1%. . On Wednesday, U.S. stocks ended higher for a second consecutive session as a decline in the price of crude helped offset an $821 million loss for mortgage giant Freddie Mac.
