 An early interest rate cut might be needed to ward off a sharper economic slowdown, with scope for a less restrictive monetary policy increasing, the minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's August board meeting say.The RBA left official interest rates on hold at 7.25% on August 5 for the fifth consecutive month.But the minutes of that board meeting, released today, indicate the central bank saw the case for a near-term rate cut.'Indeed, less restrictive conditions could soon be called for, otherwise the risk of a deeper and more persistent slowing in the economy would increase,'' the minutes said.'On these considerations, a case could be made for an early reduction in the cash rate.'Weighing up all considerations, members judged that the current stance of policy was appropriate for the time being.'Nonetheless, given the slower trend in demand, scope to move towards a less restrictive setting of monetary policy was judged to be increasing.''The minutes said the RBA was concerned about the effect of tight financial conditions.'Members were conscious that financial conditions were clearly quite tight, and effectively getting tighter as a result of ongoing pressure on lenders' costs of funds in the market,'' the minutes said.'Given there had been a significant change in borrowing behaviour, confidence was weaker, asset prices had declined and slower overall growth was in prospect, tighter financial conditions were not warranted.''But the RBA was still concerned about wage inflation, even though it had not yet seen evidence of this.'Firstly, a lengthy period of inflation above the target was occurring, with attendant risk that this would begin to affect wage setting, though there was no evidence of this in aggregate wages data to date,'' the minutes said.'If that occurred, the cost of reducing inflation later would be greater.'Policy had to take account of this risk, particularly given both the recent high CPI reading and those in prospect in the near term.'This argued for maintaining the current stance of policy.''Consumer price index (CPI) inflation in the year to June surged by 4.5%, well above the central bank's 2% to 3% target band.Still, the RBA expected inflation to moderate in 2009 and 2010.
