 Tullow Oil was in demand yesterday after some positive comment from analysts and suggestions that it could be a takeover candidate.The oil and gas explorer, which is due to release half-year results next Wednesday, added 47.5p to 741.5p after UBS raised its recommendation from neutral to buy and set a 950p target. 'Tullow's shares have fallen 31% since June,' UBS said. 'Given its superior exploration and appraisal opportunity set, we believe Tullow should outperform should the oil price rebound and the market's appetite for exploration exposure return. Also, further exploration success could make Tullow a merger and acquisition target next year, such is the size and quality of the Ghanaian discoveries, with potential for additional upside from Uganda.' In fact, the crude oil price lost early gains yesterday, dipping nearly $2 a barrel as US stockpiles were higher than expected. But gas prices jumped 11% after a leak at a key Norwegian pipeline.Royal Bank of Scotland analyst Phil Corbett said: 'UK gas prices have posted significant gains on news that a pipeline from the Kvitebjrn gas field in Norway (which we estimate comprises 5% of 2008 forecast Norwegian gas output) was shut down after a leak was discovered. This is bullish for Dana Petroleum, Tullow and Venture Production, and highlights the jittery nature of the markets to any sign of indigenous supply disruptions.' Dana closed 78p higher at 13.71, and Venture ended up 20.5p at 765p.A rise in commodities companies - miners as well as oil businesses - was the main factor behind a recovery in the market yesterday. There were some early jitters on Wall Street as troubled US mortgage lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae saw their shares continue to head south, but by the time London closed the US market was up by about 50 points. So the FTSE 100 ended 51.4 points higher at 5371.8 and the FTSE 250 gained 29.7 points to 8897.3.Despite a late dip in the copper price, in tandem with the fall in oil, Rio Tinto rose 345p to 49.86 and Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation climbed 67p to 10.27. Seven of the top 10 risers in the leading index were miners. And one of the biggest gainers in the mid-cap index was International Ferro Metals, up 3.75p to 70.75p. After a visit to the company's South African operations, Numis came away with the impression that a new operational management was well placed to improve production levels over the next 12 to 18 months. The broker concluded IFM was 'substantially undervalued'. The recruitment group Michael Page jumped 30.75p to 360.75p on hopes that its Swiss rival Adecco could come back with an improved offer. Traders suggested Adecco could raise its bid from 400p a share to about 500p.But comments from David Montgomery's European publisher Mecom, down 3.5p to 18.5p, about the problems facing newspapers in the digital age left Trinity Mirror 5.5p lower at 95p and Johnston Press down 2p at 52.5p.BT fell 12p to 165.3p after its shares went ex-dividend and analysts at Collins Stewart issued a sell note. 'This year's dividend looks secure but what about next? BT's cash flows continue to come under pressure from lower margins and higher capital expenditure.' J Sainsbury lost 12p to 314.75p as JP Morgan cut its recommendation from overweight to neutral in the wake of this week's market share figures from TNS Worldpanel. 'Sainsbury's food trading is the weakest of the big four and we can foresee [this] worsening as the downtrading theme continues and the fillip from Marks &amp;amp; Spencer's poor performance dissipates,' the bank said. Marks slipped 3.75p to 252p as the company brought forward a trading statement by about a month, which could mean it is struggling to revive its sales growth.Barclays was 9.25p lower at 315p after reports the bank may consider buying a wealth-management business in the US, but RSA Insurance added 3.9p to 142.5p on revived bid speculation. Medical equipment group Smith &amp;amp; Nephew continued to rise on talk of interest from US rival Zimmer, up another 10.5p to 642.5p. But Scottish &amp;amp; Southern Energy, powered up on Tuesday by suggestions of a possible bid from Sweden's Vattenfall, slipped back 38p to 14.15. Funeral group Dignity added 18p to 740p after reports that 3i was planning to buy 75% of its Spanish counterpart Mmora Inversiones Funerarias. The terms of the deal put a value of 330m (260m) on the continental group. 'The multiple would imply a fair value of 960p for Dignity,' said Citigroup. 'That said, we think it unlikely that Dignity would be a bid target currently, having come out of private equity ownership in 2004 and with already high levels of financial leverage.' Finally, the troubled engineering minnow Tanfield fell 3.6% to 8.3p as it announced plans to lay off 125 workers at its Snorkel business in Kansas.Hard to remember the last time an analyst upgraded Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley. Apparently, it hasn't happened since Collins Stewart in January. But Oriel Securities took the plunge, moving from reduce to hold. Oriel said the rights issue take-up was better than expected, the appointment of Richard Pym as chief executive was positive and a fair value for the shares - down 2p to 49.75p yesterday - was closer to 100p: 'The underwriters have until August 22 to place the balance of the shares. While the overhang presents a near-term investment risk, B&amp;amp;B now emerges as a well-capitalised bank.'
