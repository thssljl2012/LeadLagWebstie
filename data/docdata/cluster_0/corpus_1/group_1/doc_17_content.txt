Consumer confidence for August will also be released.Also, the US Federal Reserve publishes the minutes from its August meeting, where US interest rates were left unchanged at two per cent.At 1600 AEST, the Reserve Bank of Australia's trade weighted index (TWI) was at 67.5, down from Monday's close of 67.8.Help  Privacy   Contact Us   Conditions   Member Agreement
