 A cut in official interest rates next month would be a vindication of the Rudd government's first budget, Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner says.The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is widely expected to cut interest rates in September after showing concern last week about the potential for the economy to slow too much.High domestic interest rates, as well as global factors such as the ongoing fallout from the credit crisis, have seen consumer demand in Australia cool significantly in recent months.Mr Tanner said that Labor's first budget in 13 years - including a $22 billion surplus - was a crucial factor in the RBA now being able to consider cutting rates.'One of the reasons why it's possible the Reserve Bank may reduce interest rates in a week or two is because the budget is very strong, because the surplus is very substantial,' Mr Tanner told Network Ten.'That puts downward pressure on inflation and interest rates.'Mr Tanner denied the budget went too far and risked stifling growth.'We do need a strong surplus still,' he said.'I don't believe the economy is slowing dramatically.'It's slowing somewhat but the Reserve Bank is still predicting economic growth to be in the order of two per cent.'Mr Tanner added that news of job cuts at Ford and Boeing in recent days should not be seen as evidence the economy had cooled too much.It's been revealed Boeing plans to slash more than 500 jobs within 18 months in Victoria, with 350 to go initially.On Friday, Ford announced plans to axe up to 350 jobs at its two Victorian plants.'The overall employment figures are still very robust and we anticipate that they will continue to be in good shape,' Mr Tanner said.'It's very wrong to draw wider conclusions from these things. What you've got to look at is all the economic data and that suggests the economy is still in reasonably good shape.'Yes it's slowing, but it's not slowing unduly.'Opposition Leader Brendan Nelson said the Rudd government should release an economic statement setting out how it plans to deal with a faltering economy.'We need to hear from Mr Rudd how he will address the current slowdown, without Rudd-speak and without a commitment to simply watch,' Dr Nelson said.'Now that unemployment, inflation and growth are all worsening, it is time for Mr Rudd to set out how he will deal with these problems.'Mr Tanner said the opposition was putting at risk steps the government had already taken to deal with challenges facing the economy.He said opposition plans to block numerous pieces of legislation related to the budget would put at risk the RBA's ability to cut rates.The opposition says it will oppose a number of the government's budget measures, including tax increases on pre-mixed drinks and luxury cars, as well as a hike in the Medicare levy threshold.'The end result if they succeed will be that it will be harder for the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates,' Mr Tanner said.The opposition, however, said any cut in rates would simply be the result of market forces and banks being able to source cheaper funds.'Mr (Wayne) Swan and Mr Tanner are kidding themselves if they think they are responsible for any downwards movements in interest rates,' opposition finance spokesman Peter Dutton told AAP.'This is another political stunt by the Rudd government.'They really need to show some economic sense and some understanding of how this economy works.' 2008 AAPBrought to you byWhen news happens:send photos, videos &amp;amp; tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us.7:00PM US NBA stars outlast Spain to win men's basketball gold6:51PM Likely rate cut vindicates govt: Tanner6:43PM WA Libs make education key priority
