 There has been a significant decline in credit card use in 2008, a response to the increasing cost of living and high interest rates. Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) data shows the annual rate of growth in credit card balances declined to 4.7% in June 2008, although balances rose slightly. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show sales of new cars fell 3.4% in July 2008 and were 4.1% lower than a year before. The data indicates domestic demand has been affected by strict financial conditions, with the RBA expected to respond by reducing official interest rates. There are market expectations of consecutive cuts of 0.25 of a percentage point in September and October 2008
