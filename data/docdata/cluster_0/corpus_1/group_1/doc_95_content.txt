 SYDNEY, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd (CBA) , the country's second-biggest lender, will do its best to pass on to its customers any cut in official interest rates, Chief Executive Ralph Norris said on Wednesday.He was speaking after the bank matched expectations for flat second-half earnings, and warned of a challenging year ahead due to volatile global markets and upward pressure on funding costs.Australia's central bank is expected by many economists to cut the official rate, now at a 12-year high of 7.25 percent, as early as next month. There are concerns local banks may not pass on the full extent of any rate cut because of the global credit squeeze.(Reporting by Mette Fraende, editing by Mark Bendeich) . ngInteractive Investor brings you breaking news throughout the day to support your investment decisions.
