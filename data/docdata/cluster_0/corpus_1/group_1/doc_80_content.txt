 LONDON  Gold fell as the U.S. dollar extended gains against the euro after U.S. inflation data came in higher than expected, while platinum held just off an 11-month low of $1,296.50 (U.S.) hit in Asian trade.Gold was at $790.50/791.50 an ounce at 1335 GMT against $799.65/801.05 late in New York on Monday, having earlier hit a session low of $782.05.Despite the pick-up in the dollar, the precious metal ran into good technical support at $775 an ounce, analysts say, while demand from jewellers, which suffered earlier in the year as prices rose, is picking up. We are seeing extremely strong jewellery demand over the last week, much stronger than I have seen before, noted UBS analyst John Reade.Nonetheless the firm dollar, which has dented gold's appeal as an alternative investment, is keeping prices under $800. A resurgence in the U.S. currency has been a key factor in pressuring all the precious metals lower in recent weeks.The dollar rose to a six-month high against the euro and its strongest level this year against a basket of currencies on Monday, on ongoing fears over global economic growth.It extended those gains after the U.S. producer price index came in stronger than expected.A weakening in the oil prices is also weighing on the precious metal, reducing the attraction of gold as a hedge against inflation.Oil slipped towards $112 a barrel after a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico, which it was feared would affect oil installations there, passed without major disruption. The combination of the dollar strengthening and softer oil prices have kept gold prices under pressure, Barclays Capital analysts said in a note.Platinum and palladium came under pressure from fears slowing economic growth could dent demand from the automotive industry, which consumes more than half of the world's platinum.Both metals remain lower after dropping more than 6 per cent in Asia, with benchmark Tokyo platinum futures falling by their daily limit to a one-year low, as traders worried about the outlook for demand from carmakers. Platinum closed in New York last night around $1,390 and this morning we hit a low below $1,300, said Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS Finance. That was the main reason for everything else coming off quite sharply. Spot platinum was at $1,316.00/1,336.00 at 0953 GMT against $1,386.00/1,406.00 an ounce late in New York, having earlier touched a session low of $1,296.50, its weakest level since Sept 2007.Investment bank Investec cut its third-quarter price target for platinum on Tuesday to $1,660 an ounce from $2,050 an ounce, and sliced its full-year market deficit to 194,000 ounces.Among other precious metals spot palladium fell to $275.00/283.00 an ounce from $283.00/291.00 an ounce.Silver slipped to $12.90/12.96 an ounce from $13.07/13.13 an ounce, having earlier touched a low of $12.45.
