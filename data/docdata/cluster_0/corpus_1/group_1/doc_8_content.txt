The forecast implies a jump in unemployment from 4.3% to 6% by the end of next year.Australia's rate of economic growth, at present 3.6%, is forecast to slow to 2% by the end of this year, with about half of that coming from the mining and agricultural sectors, implying a paltry 1% growth rate in the rest of the economy.Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said the Reserve Bank seemed to be 'shocked' by the severity of the slowdown that it had helped engineer.'It's worried about the global outlook and concerned that that financial turmoil could exacerbate the slowdown,' he said.The RBA said some of the downward revision in its forecasts was due to the explosion at Western Australia's Varanus Island gas plant, which had cut that state's gas output by one-third and would knock 0.25 of a percentage point off national economic growth.But it said there had also been 'a sharp slowing in credit expansion to both households and businesses' as private lenders had pushed up their interest rates by more than it did and toughened their lending standards.Housing loan approvals had fallen 20% since the start of the year and business loans were growing at an annualised rate of just 8% - well down on the 17% growth rate at the end of last year.The RBA said that retail spending was falling in real terms, as were sales of motor cars and consumer and business confidence. Lending finance figures released yesterday posted their biggest slide in 16 years.Total lending slumped 13.3% in the year to May, the biggest annual decline since January 1992 when Australia was emerging from recession.The bank raised its inflation forecast, saying it now expects the headline rate to peak at 5% in December before easing to 3% by mid-2010.But this would not stop it cutting interest rates, saying that, so long as the economy remained subdued, the scope for rate cuts was 'increasing'.The bank is expected to cut its cash rate by 0.25% when its board meets on September 2, the first such cut for seven years. A member of the Reserve Bank board, former Woolworths chief Roger Corbett, told Sky News yesterday that Australia was 'resilient' and had a strong, broad base.
