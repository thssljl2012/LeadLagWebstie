 Shares in BT (UK:BTA: news, chart, profile) dropped 11.4% after its fiscal first-quarter net profit fell by more than a third and underlying earnings came in just short of market expectations. Citigroup analyst Michael Williams said the 9.5% margin at BT's global services unit in the quarter was disappointing because of rising input costs, changes in exchange rates and a change in sales mix toward lower-margin products. The division is closely watched because it's seen as the main growth driver for the company. 'The first quarter represents a poor start to the year,' Williams said in a note to clients. 'Performance should improve markedly in the second half, but continued concerns over pensions, outlook for global services and capital expenditure are likely to remain,' he added. Elsewhere in the sector, shares in Carphone Warehouse (UK:CPW: news, chart, profile) fell as much as 4% before rebounding slightly to trade down around 1%. The company cut its forecast for new broadband customers this year to between 200,000 and 250,000. In April, the group said it was expecting 400,000 new broadband customers in the year. The main FTSE 100 index (UK:UKX: news, chart, profile) rose 0.6%, or 32 points at 5,452.70, helped by gains for banks, miners and most oil stocks. Shares in mortgage lender HBOS (UK:HBOS: news, chart, profile) rose 9% after it announced a 57% drop in profit that wasn't as bad as analysts had feared. The bank took write-downs of 1.1 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) on debt securities and said it may sell some assets to improve its deposit-to-loan ratio.  Other banks were mostly higher, with Lloyds TSB (UK:LLOY: news, chart, profile) up 3.5% and Barclays (UK:BARC: news, chart, profile) (BCS:BCSNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) up 2.8%. AstraZeneca (UK:AZN: news, chart, profile) (AZN:AZNNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) shares rose 3.8% after the drugmaker lifted its core earnings per share view by 15 cents to a range of $4.60 to $4.90.  Royal Dutch Shell (UK:RDSA: news, chart, profile) (RDSA:RDSANews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) said its second-quarter profit jumped 33% as surging prices helped offset lower production as the group struggles to pump oil out of Nigeria.  The results fell short of expectations and helped send shares in the company down 0.9%. Other oil and gas companies were higher, however, after a rebound in crude prices late on Wednesday. Shares in BP (UK:BP: news, chart, profile) (BP:BPNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) rose 2.5% and BG Group (UK:BG: news, chart, profile) climbed 2.9%. Another big faller was consumer products group Unilever (UK:ULVR: news, chart, profile) (UL:ULNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) , which lost 7.3% after its earnings fell short of expectations, partly due to sharp rises in commodity costs in recent months. Underlying sales rose nearly 7%, but the growth was solely due to price increases, with volumes declining.  Shares in brewer SABMiller (UK:SAB: news, chart, profile) fell 3.2% after it reported declining beer volumes, hurt by a weaker performance in China and the moderation of consumer spending in some markets. Mining stocks were among the winners on Thursday as commodity prices rose. BHP Billiton (UK:BLT: news, chart, profile) (BHP:BHPNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) rose 3.8% and Rio Tinto (UK:RIO: news, chart, profile) (RTP:RTPNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) added 2.7%. LONDON (MarketWatch) -- A disappointing first-quarter performance sent shares in telecoms company BT Group sharply lower Thursday, while gains for HBOS and a higher profit forecast from AstraZeneca helped push the main U.K. index higher.
