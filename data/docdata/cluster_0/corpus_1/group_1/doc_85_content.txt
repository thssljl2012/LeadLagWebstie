  By Masayuki KitanoTOKYO, Aug 26 (Reuters) - U.S. 10-year Treasury notes dipped in Asian trading on Tuesday, trimming some of the gains made the previous day when Treasuries rallied on credit jitters and a sharp slide in equities.The benchmark 10-year Treasury note dipped 3/32 in price to yield 3.797 percent , pulling away from a three-month low of around 3.77 percent hit on Monday. 'The focus is on financial sector issues,' said Yoshio Takahashi, fixed-income strategist for Barclays Capital.Treasuries are susceptible to any headlines regarding the financial sector and to swings in the stock market, he said.The previous day's rally in Treasuries may have been exaggerated by light trading volumes, Takahashi said, adding that Treasuries may pull back once players in London return after a UK bank holiday on Monday.The two-year Treasury note was steady in price from late U.S. trading on Monday with a yield of 2.333 percent . U.S. stocks fell sharply on Monday as credit concerns hounded financial stocks while global growth worries hurt big technology and industrial companies. The three major stock indexes all fell about 2 percent and wiped out gains booked on Friday. [.N]Investors are watching to see just how much action the U.S. government may take to support housing finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said Takahashi at Barclays Capital.Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson last month outlined a series of backstop measures that could be used to support Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including a fresh injection of capital from the government.Speculation has mounted in financial markets that the Treasury eventually would be forced to add capital.But a smooth $2 billion short-term debt sale by Freddie Mac on Monday helped to reassure investors that both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae can fund operations without a government bailout.
