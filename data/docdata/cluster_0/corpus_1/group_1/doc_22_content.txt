 U.S. stocks on Thursday declined sharply after the government reported a rise in weekly jobless claims,  reported a large loss, and  sales weighed on sentiment. 'Weekly jobless claims have not been kind of late, [and] Wal-Mart's same-store sales are a disappointment, which is raising some concerns about the consumer's health,' said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald. The major stock indexes pared their losses after data pointed to a possible strengthening in the U.S. housing market in coming months. The National Association of Realtors reported its index of sales contracts on previously owned U.S. homes rose 5.3% in June from the prior month. Off more than 150 points early on, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was more recently off 92.41 points at 11,563.66. Of the blue-chip index's 30 components, 22 were trading in the red, the losses paced by AIG , which was down 15.5% after the insurance giant reported $5.36 billion in mortgage-related losses. The S&amp;amp;P 500 shed 8.5 points to 1,280.69, with all but one of its 10 industry groups on the decline, led by consumer discretionary and financials, with both sectors off 1%. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite declined 8.73 points to 2,369.64. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil futures gained, with crude for September delivery recently up $1.42 at $120 a barrel. . Retail trouble Retailers also deepened investors' gloom, with most reporting worse-than- forecast same-store sales for July, with Wal-Mart Stores , the world's largest retailer, among those missing targets. Separately, the Labor Department reported the count of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week climbed to 455,000, its highest level in more than six years. . Overseas, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank both held rates unchanged. In overseas trade, European shares edged higher, with the pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index up 0.2% to 288.27. . In Asia, stocks closed on a mostly weak note, with Japan's Nikkei 225 Average down 1%. . On Wednesday, U.S. stocks ended higher for a second consecutive session as a decline in the price of crude helped offset an $821 million loss for mortgage giant Freddie Mac.
