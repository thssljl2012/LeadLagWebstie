 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says he remains confident the federal government has the policy settings right to deal with the challenges facing the economy.Mr Rudd defended his government's economic credentials, denying it was responsible for flagging business and consumer confidence levels.He also rejected a suggestion that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) may have gone too far in raising interest rates. 'The bottom line is this. They've responded to high inflation by Australian historical standards - the highest inflation in 16 years - which is what we inherited last year,' he told ABC Television. 'And what we're seeing is the washthrough of 10 interest rate rises in a row under the Liberals.' He said governments needed a plan to respond to such a challenging economic environment. 'Our practical plan is to see the economy through in the long term and that means making some tough decisions to do that.' Mr Rudd said the he believed the government had the right policy settings to deal with the current economic challenges. 'We've got our policy settings, we believe, right for the circumstances.'  2008 AAP Brought to you by
