 THE Australian dollar was lower at noon, falling below $US0.8600 after the New Zealand dollar was punished by a worse than expected trade deficit and the local currency followed suit.At 12noon (AEST), the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.8595/98, down from yesterday's close of $US0.8652/54. During the morning, the local currency moved between a low of $US0.8568 and a high of $US0.8648. This morning's low of $US0.8568 was below the $US0.8593 reached on August 13 and the weakest level since January 22, when the currency hit $US0.8514. Societe Generale chief foreign exchange dealer Paul Milton said the catalyst for today's move lower was New Zealand's disappointing trade deficit. 'The Kiwi has been hit very hard and the Aussie has gone along for the ride,'' Mr Milton said. New Zealand's trade deficit grew to $NZ781 million ($637.92 million) in July, well above the median market forecast of $NZ526 million.The Australian dollar has lost 13 per cent since hitting a 25-year high of $US0.9849 on July 16 - levels not seen since the days of a fixed exchange rate. 'I can't see any blue sky at the moment. I can't see any valid reason why you'd really want to be buying the Aussie at the moment,'' Mr Milton said. While the US dollar's revival had contributed to the Australian dollar's sharp decline, Mr Milton said domestic factors equally were significant. Mr Milton said falling commodity prices, imminent interest rate cuts and a slowing domestic economy had made rallies difficult to sustain. He predicted the unit could fall to $US0.8200. 'The Aussie has a good reason to be down here,'' Mr Milton said. 'There's not a lot of positive news out there for the Aussie at the moment, not enough to counter this down move.'' The Reserve Bank of Australia was tipped widely to cut the official cash rate, which sits at a 12-year high of 7.25 per cent, at next week's September board meeting.
