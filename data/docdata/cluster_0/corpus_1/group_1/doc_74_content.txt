 BHP Billiton is under pressure to set a new profit record for an Australian company amid growing concerns commodity prices have peaked.The world's biggest mining group will unveil its full-year financial result this afternoon with analysts tipping a corporate history-making profit of more than $US15 billion ($17.26 billion).Demand from China has pushed output across key commodities such as iron ore, copper and alumina to record levels for BHP, which also is benefiting from an oil price that has soared until recently.'The petroleum group has the best chance of bringing home some big numbers this year following record high oil prices,'' Wiseowl.com senior equities analyst Simon Guzowski said.Fat Prophets head of mining and resources research, Gavin Wendt, said BHP would also benefit from skyrocketing prices for iron ore and thermal and coking coal.'The other major commodity earner for them is copper and while prices have fallen away in the last few weeks to a six-month low, up to June 30 prices were not far off record highs so that has to be a positive for BHP's earnings,'' he said.Mr Guzowski said a bumper result could increase the chances of BHP's $150 billion takeover bid for rival Rio Tinto succeeding.'If BHP is able to demonstrate stronger growth in its production numbers than Rio, it would look to use these to try to convince Asian buyers and European regulators that commodity supply is more likely to rise under a merged group,'' he said.However, the market will also be scouring the report for signs of weakness, particularly around operating costs.'A number of miners have been hit quite hard by rising fuel, processing, machinery and labour costs,'' Mr Guzowski said.Also weighing on the outlook is fear that supply is catching up with demand, with global commodity prices for oil, gold and copper plunging in recent weeks.'We're expecting a great result, but because you've had so much change over the last month, particularly in these commodity prices coming off . . . the market will be more focused on those issues going forward,'' Stock Resource managing director Stephen Bartrop said.'The fact that the oil price is coming off its highs is a negative in the sense that the increase in earnings momentum for BHP is going to be diminished.''Mr Guzowski agreed all eyes would be on the miner's outlook for commodity prices.Rio Tinto reports its half year results next Tuesday.Meanwhile, the Australian market is likely to open weaker today on lower commodity prices which will put pressure on resource stocks.About 60 major companies -- including Qantas and Wesfarmers -- are due to report earnings this week, which will show how the slowing economy is affecting the corporate sector.Investors will also be focused on tomorrow's release of the Reserve Bank of Australia's minutes from its August board meeting, which are likely to confirm that an interest rate cut is on the way.
