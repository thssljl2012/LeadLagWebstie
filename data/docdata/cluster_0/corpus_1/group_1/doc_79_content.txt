 THE Australian dollar finished at its weakest level in four months as the lowest number of home loan approvals since 2004 for owner-occupied housing signalled to traders interest rates could be cut as early as next month.It was the sixth consecutive trading day where the local currency closed lower than the previous session even though the unit clawed back in the final hour of domestic trade as bargain hunters stepped in. At 1700 AEST, the Australian dollar was trading at 92 US cents, down from Tuesday's close of 92.18 US cents. It was the currency's weakest local finish since April 4. Traders in Europe helped the Australian dollar touch 92 US cents in the final minutes of local trade. The local unit hit a four-month low of 91.33 US cents in offshore trading before the domestic market opened. Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data showing the number of new home loans fell by 3.7 per cent in June, seasonally adjusted, had only short-term effect on the local dollar. This was the fifth successive month of decline. The 50,294 new mortgages for owner occupiers in June was the lowest since mid 2004. Citigroup managing director of economics Stephen Halmarick said the Australian dollar recovered in the afternoon despite the gloomy housing finance data because traders saw the currency as oversold. 'The market has a September rate cut pretty well priced in,' he said. 'The risk is that they (the Reserve Bank of Australia) don't go in September.' Selling pressure on the Australian dollar intensified yesterday after the RBA left interest rates on hold at 7.25 per cent and signalled it would move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance. The Australian dollar has fallen by 6.6 per cent since it reached a 25-year high of 98.50 US cents on July 16. Mr Halmarick said the domestic currency would climb back to 94 US cents in coming weeks. 'We've fallen a long way from the high,' he said. 'The market is probably correcting a little bit from the rapid downdraft.' The Australian dollar finished at 99.66 Japanese yen, up from Tuesday's local close of 99.37, and at 59.27 euro cents, down from 59.33 cents. The euro finished at 1.5515 US dollars, down from Tuesday's close of 1.5540 US dollars and at 168.09 Japanese yen, up from 167.52 yen. The US dollar closed the local session at 108.34 yen, up from 107.81 yen. Share this article
