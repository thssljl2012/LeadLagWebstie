 AFTER weeks of jawboning the banks, Treasurer Wayne Swan would have been relieved to take a call from National Australia Bank chief Ahmed Fahour late on Wednesday telling him he was about to fall into line on interest rates.Whether the NAB blinked as a result of political pressure or whether it was opportunistic marketing is a moot point. What matters is that Mr Swan and thousands of mortgage holders got what they wanted: a public promise yesterday that if, as expected, the Reserve Bank cuts interest rates by 0.25 percentage points next month, the NAB will pass it on in full to its customers.The NAB has given no guarantees that it will pass on any subsequent reductions - and the RBA may go harder than the anticipated 0.25% next month.But its move has enabled the Treasurer to turn the screws on other major banks, and he was predictably blunt yesterday, telling them to take 'a good hard look at themselves'.'I've made it very clear that I expect the banks to pass on official rate cuts,' Mr Swan said.The NAB's variable interest rate after the proposed cut would be 9.36%.Its announcement yesterday prompted a counter-strike by the Commonwealth Bank, which cut its fixed-rate mortgages for the second time in a fortnight.But the Commonwealth gave no undertaking to pass on the full September rate cut. It said it would do its best 'to pass on as much as we can'.Other major banks have said they would pass on the full rate cut only if it was responsible to do so. An ANZ spokeswoman said yesterday: 'We will pass on any reduction in the Reserve Bank's cash rate to ANZ's variable home loan rates as funding costs allow.'Westpac executives giving evidence before a parliamentary inquiry also refused to make any commitments. Kelvin Lawrence, who looks after Westpac mortgages, said it was not possible to say whether the bank would pass on interest rate cuts.Market analysts remain unsure whether the RBA will cut rates by 0.25 percentage points in September followed by another 0.25 percentage point cut in October, or whether it will go for a big hit of half a percentage point next month.
