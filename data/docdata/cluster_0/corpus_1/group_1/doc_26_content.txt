 SYDNEY: Australian shares could face a bumpy ride in the week ahead as the market continues to be affected by changes in the oil price, commodity prices and the performance of financial stocks, dealers said. For the week ending Aug 8, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index closed up 82.2 points or 1.7 percent at 4,986.2. Dealers said that while weaker commodities prices had dragged resources stocks down, indications from the central Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) that the next interest rate move will be downward helped to buoy the market. "But against this a cyclical correction in commodity prices may drag on resources shares, which will likely result in the Australian share market underperforming global shares for a few months." Oliver said that while Australian shares seemed to have found strong support around the 4,800 level, this could be just 'another bear-market bounce.' "We still see the next few months as being quite rough with the prospect of more weakness in Sept/Oct as the global economic downturn feeds into more profit downgrades, particularly for cyclical sectors," he said. Among the companies reporting next week are the country's dominant telco Telstra and the Commonwealth Bank. afp
