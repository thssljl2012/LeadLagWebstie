 National Australia Bank vowed to pass on central bank interest rate cuts on 21 August 2008. Australian CEO, Ahmed Fahour, said the bank will reduce its standard variable mortgage rate by 0.25 per cent to 9.36 per cent if the Reserve Bank of Australia reduces rates at its September meeting. Fahour said lowering interest rates could provide a boost to consumer confidence, although analysts questioned whether the move was not rather aimed at increasing market share
