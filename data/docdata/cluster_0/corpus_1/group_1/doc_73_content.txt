 Australian banks and lenders will have no excuse not to follow Wizard Home Loans' lead and cut their interest rates if conditions continue, Treasurer Wayne Swan says.Wizard Home Loans on Sunday became the first leader to cut its variable interest rate in seven years.Wizard cut its variable rate from 9.54 to 9.29 per cent, effective from Sunday, in a move announced three days before the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) decides whether to reduce rates.Mr Swan called the news a 'wonderful weekend surprise' and said other banks would soon have no choice but to follow.Banks broke with recent tradition this year and raised mortgage rates independently of the RBA, blaming the global credit crunch.But Mr Swan said recent changes in funding costs on international markets would give banks the capacity to reduce rates, independently of the Reserve Bank's decision this week.'There has been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times they've been coming down as well and that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions in other funding costs outside the Reserve Bank cycle,' Mr Swan told reporters in Brisbane.'And over time there will be no excuse not to further cut rates if funding costs continue to come down.'Mr Swan said banks also had passed on previous RBA rate rises 'in a nano-second' and should pass on any cuts just as quickly.'The other lenders don't need to be magicians, they just need to do the right thing and pass on any cut if that's decided by the Reserve Bank,' Mr Swan said.'If the Reserve Bank cuts rates this week there will be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates, none at all.'The RBA is widely expected to cut the cash rate by 0.25 per cent to 7 per cent on Tuesday due to a combination of a slowing economy, deteriorating business conditions and tight credit markets.CommSec's chief economist Craig James said rates on fixed term mortgages had been cut in the last month by the major banks but Sunday's move by Wizard is the first cut to standard variable rates by a lender.'They've jumped the gun and it does throw down the gauntlet to the other institutions,' Mr James said.'We do think it's almost certain the Reserve Bank will be cutting interest rates on Tuesday.'Other banks will be following suit. They (Wizard) have garnered a few headlines but at the end of the day we're going to see a lot of other institutions falling in line.'All of the 17 economists surveyed by AAP last week believe the easing cycle will begin next Tuesday following the RBA's September meeting.Most expect the RBA to end a run of 12 successive rate rises and lower the cash rate by 25 basis points, marking the first cut in almost seven years, or since December 2001.
