 AUSTRALIAN stocks were trading higher today after Wall St rallied on the US Federal Reserve's decision to hold rates and the retreating oil price.In the US, the Dow spiked after the US Federal Reserve left interest rates on hold, assuaging some of the market's fears about the economy. At 1200 AEST, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was up 154.7 points, or 3.21 per cent, to 4975.3, while the broader All Ordinaries climbed 144.1 points, or 2.95 per cent, to 5026.8. The September share price index futures contract was up 123 points to 4950 on a volume of 16,856 contracts. Media giant News Corp advanced 63 cents, or 3.91 per cent, to $16.73 and its non-voting scrip firmed 61 cents, or 3.91 per cent, to $16.20. ABN AMRO Morgans Private client adviser Bill Bishop said most sectors benefited from the US Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady overnight. 'It's the strongest showing we've had since God knows how long,'' Mr Bishop said. 'The market got excited because the (US Federal Reserve) said it would hold rates where they are, which is a good thing. 'And now of course the Reserve bank here has alluded to a cut at some stage in the future.'' 'It's terrific to see. It's just what we needed.'' The financial sector enjoyed the renewed optimism with Commonwealth Bank of Australia adding $2.35, or 5.65 per cent to $43.60, National Australia Bank lifting $1.06, or 4.28 per cent to $25.82, Westpac Banking Corp rising $1.04, or 4.85 per cent to $22.90 and ANZ Banking Group leaping 85 cents, or 4.94 per cent to $17.86. Takeover target St George Bank climbed $1.48, or 5.39 per cent to $28.92. Mr Bishop said that despite the positive outlook today, investors were hesitant to take the plunge into market. 'Clients have been battered and are still shaking their heads, a little bit dazed and hoping there are better days around the corner,'' he said. 'If we had some sunny days ahead of us, then I think they will start to pay attention again.'' The major miners also managed to lift, despite metals and oil sentiment continuing to waver. Market leader BHP was up $1.06, or 2.99 per cent to $36.88 while rival and takeover target Rio Tinto Ltd rose $3.50, or 3.16 per cent to $114.30.Share this article
