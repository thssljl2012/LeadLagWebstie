 LONDON/TOKYO -- The dollar fell against the euro but rose versus the yen and pound Monday as the market awaited interest rate decisions this week from the Federal Reserve, ECB and Bank of England. In late morning London trading, the European single currency gained to US$1.5578 from US$1.5555 late Friday in New York. Against the Japanese currency, the dollar climbed to 108.07 yen from 107.68. 'The dollar has remained resilient to bad news on the U.S. economy over recent weeks in part due to the increased speculation that the European Central Bank's rate hike (in July) was a one-off given the notable downturn in economic activity,' said Derek Halpenny, analyst at The Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi in London.In London trade Monday, the euro changed hands at US$1.5578 against US$1.5555 late Friday, at 168.37 yen (167.52), 0.7914 pounds (0.7874) and 1.6341 Swiss francs (1.6327). The dollar stood at 108.07 yen (107.68) and 1.0484 Swiss francs (1.0497).The pound was at US$1.9692 (US$1.9753). On the London Bullion Market, the price of gold dipped to US$912.38 per ounce from US$912.50 late Friday. In Hong Kong, gold prices closed higher Monday at US$913.5-914 an ounce, up from Friday's close of US$908.50-909.50. It opened at US$910.80-911.30.Earlier in Tokyo afternoon trade, the euro rose to US$1.5586 from US$1.5555 in New York late Friday, and to 167.82 yen from 167.52. The dollar was steady at 107.69 yen after 107.68.Against Asian currencies, the dollar edged up to S$1.3701 from S$1.3698 Friday, to 1,017.40 South Korean won from 1,014.15 and to NT$30.71 from NT$30.68. It gained to 9,097.00 Indonesian rupiah from 9,092.50, to 44.47 Philippine pesos from 44.22 and to 33.54 Thai baht from 33.53.Halpenny also said that the U.S. currency had won support owing to speculation that the Federal Reserve would respond to the threat of U.S. inflation by raising the federal funds rate by year-end. 'Both of these views will be tested this week with the Fed and ECB monetary policy meetings tomorrow (Tuesday) and Thursday, respectively. The BOE and the RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia) also meet this week which could also have implications for the dollar,' Halpenny added. Ahead of the rate decisions, traders were digesting Friday's data showing that the U.S. economy had shed 51,000 jobs in July, a seventh straight monthly loss, while unemployment hit a four-year high of 5.7 percent. But the closely watched report was not as bad as feared, as most economists had predicted 75,000 jobs would be lost. Some analysts believe the US$14 trillion U.S. economy has already slumped into a recession but others say the economic picture is not so dire and that two successive quarters of negative growth will be avoided.If market predictions come true, the Fed will keep rates on hold at 2.0 percent for a second straight time on Tuesday after slashing rates aggressively by 3.25 percentage points between September and late April, experts said. The Fed cut rates in a bid to fire up economic vitality which has been threatened by a lingering housing market downturn, a credit squeeze in the banking industry and searing oil prices.
