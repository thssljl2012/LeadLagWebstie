 National Australia Bank Limited (NAB)said it would reduce its standard variable interest rate by 0.25% if the Reserve Bank of Australia reduced the official cash rate by 0.25% at its September board meeting. NAB's current rate is to 9.36% per annum.Executive Director and CEO Australia Ahmed Fahour said NAB had been reviewing the cost of wholesale funding closely and, based on current short term funding costs, the bank would be in a position to pass on a reduction in interest rates to its customers.'While we continue to see volatility in international markets and increases in the average cost of long term funding, we have experienced some short term funding relief which we are keen to pass on to our customers,' Mr Fahour said.'While I am pleased to make today's undertaking, our medium and long term funding and our retail deposit base represent the greatest proportion of our funding costs and the average cost of these sources of funding continue to increase.'Mr Fahour said the recent fall in short term funding costs provided an opportunity to move rates in line with the RBA decision but future interest rate decisions would need to reflect an assessment of all the cost of funding factors.'All Australian banks are reliant on offshore funding and increases in the average cost of long term funding are likely to be with us for some time,' he said.'Therefore any consideration that the Federal Government can give to enhance the attractiveness of retail bank deposits will help reduce overall funding costs and assist in lowering mortgages rates.'On Thursday NAB closed down 55c or more than 2% at $23.55.
