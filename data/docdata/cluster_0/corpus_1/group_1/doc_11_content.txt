 LONDON (MarketWatch) -- The U.S. dollar retreated against most major currencies Thursday, losing ground amid ongoing financial sector worries and a rebound in oil prices. The Financial Times on Thursday reported that U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers (LEH:LEHNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) held secret talks earlier this month to sell as much as half of its shares to South Korean or Chinese parties but failed to reach agreement with either. Sharp drops Wednesday by beleaguered U.S. mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNM:FNMNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) and Freddie Mac (FRE:FRENews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) 'and talk of more problems at Lehman have rekindled fears about the financial services industry, supporting demand for safe-haven currencies and government bonds,' wrote strategists at Lloyds TSB. That's boosted the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. Meanwhile, Nymex crude oil futures for October delivery continued to push higher, gaining $1.56 to $117.12 a barrel in electronic trading. 'With Nymex crude now stabilizing above its 200-day moving average, the U.S. dollar has (as would be expected) also started to consolidate its gains against the majors,' wrote Simon Derrick, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon. Oil is traded in dollars and a move in one typically fuels an inverse move in the other. The dollar index (DXY:DXYNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) , which measures the greenback against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, was at 76.636 in recent trade, down from 76.926 in North American trading late Wednesday. The euro rose against the dollar to buy $1.4758, up from 1.4745 late Wednesday. The dollar fell against the Swiss unit to 1.0956 Swiss francs, from 1.0990 francs. The greenback also lost ground against a broadly-higher Japanese currency to 108.81 yen, compared with 109.80 yen late Wednesday. Meanwhile, purchasing managers indexes for the euro zone pointed to a further contraction in manufacturing and services activity in August. The preliminary RBS/Markit euro-zone composite PMI rose to 48.0 in August from 47.8 in July, the third consecutive month the index came in below the 50 level. A reading of more than 50 means that managers saw growth in activity, while a reading of less than 50 indicates contraction. The PMI for the services sector fell to 48.2 in August from 48.3 in July, the lowest reading since June 2003. The manufacturing PMI rose to 47.5 from 47.4 in July. 'Today's data give little hope of a rebound in the third quarter of 2008 and another strong decline of industrial new orders numbers -- due to be released tomorrow -- could add to the gloomy outlook for the euro zone,' said Joerg Radeke, economist at the Center for Economic and Business Research. The British pound gained ground, boosted by an unexpected rebound in July retail sales volume after a record monthly decline in June. The pound bought $1.8655, up from $1.8611 in late North American trade Wednesday. July retail sales saw a 0.8% monthly rise, the Office for National Statistics reported Thursday. On an annual measure, sales were 2.1% higher than a year ago, the lowest year-on-year growth since February 2006. Consensus expectations were for a 0.3% monthly decline and a 1.7% year-on-year rise, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires. The ONS downwardly revised its estimate of July retail sales volume to show a monthly fall of 4.3% compared to an initial estimate of a 3.9% decline. Annual sales growth for July was left unchanged at 2.2%.  is a reporter for MarketWatch in London.
