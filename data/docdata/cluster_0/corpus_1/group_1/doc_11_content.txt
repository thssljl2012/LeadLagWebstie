  Jitters about the health of U.S. financial institutions put equity market players in a sell first, ask questions later frame of mind on Monday. Major U.S. stock indexes had each fallen nearly 2% in slow trading early Monday afternoon. The market was weighted down by losses in financial stocks, spurred by fresh worries surrounding troubled investment bank Lehman Brothers (LEH) and giant insurer American International Group (AIG). The failure over the weekend of a Kansas-based bank, Columbian Bank and Trust, and market rumors of a hedge fund in trouble, also gave investors pause, according to S&amp;amp;P MarketScope. There was little immediate reaction to a report that U.S. existing home sales rose 3.1% in July. Bonds were surging as stocks fell. Oil futures were mixed after wild swings. Gold futures were lower, as was the U.S. dollar index. Early Monday afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 243.69 points, or 2.1%, to 11,384.37. The broader S&amp;amp;P 500 index was off 24.79 points, or 1.92%, to 1,267.41. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index dropped 49.69 points, or 2.06%, to 2,365.02. On the New York Stock Exchange, 21 stocks declined in price for every seven that gained. The ratio on the Nasdaq was 19-6 negative. Lehman Brothers' shares were under pressure after concerns a top South Korean regulator may derail the Korea Development Bank's purchase of an interest in the bank. AIG, including its insurance and financial subsidiaries, has been placed on 'Rating Watch Negative' by ratings agency Fitch Ratings. Investors continued to anticipate the possibility that U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson will produce a federal bailout plan for troubled mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE), according to S&amp;amp;P MarketScope. Shares of the two companies were higher after Freddie Mac successfullyh completed a $1 billion sale of short term debt. U.S. existing home sales rebounded 3.1% to a 5.0 million unit annual pace in July, offsetting the 2.8% drop to a 4.85 million rate in July. The reading was a little bit better than the 4.9 million expected. Sales are still down 13.2% over last year, decelerating from -15.5% previously. Single family sales rose 3.1% but are still down 12.4% from a year earlier. Condo and coop sales were up 3.4%, but are down 18.6% over last year. The months' supply of homes on the market rose to 11.2, from 11.1, on a sharp increase in condo inventory. The median sales price dipped to $212,400 from $215,100, down 7.1% year-over-year.  'Though the slightly better than expected reading suggests that bargain hunters are starting to enter the market, we still expect sales to remain weak for another year,' wrote S&amp;amp;P senior economist Beth Ann Bovino in a note Monday. Also weighing on stock prices was a rise in the price of oil. Crude oil for October delivery rose 62 cents to $115.21 per barrel. Among other stocks in the news Monday, Grey Wolf (GW) agreed to be acquired by Precision Drilling Trust (PDS) in a $2 billion deal for the Houston gas drilling firm. Precision, a Canadian firm, raised its bid after Grey Wolf rejected a buyout offer two weeks ago. Werner Enterprises (WERN) was reportedly downgraded from outperform to market perform by Wachovia analysts, who downgraded the entire U.S. trucking sector from overweight to market weight. Healthways (HWAY) affirmed previous guidance of 2008 earnings of $1.50 to $1.55 per share. The company expects solid earnings growth in the first quarter of 2009, but a decline in revenue. LDK Solar Co. (LDK) says its wafer plant reached a milestone of 1.0 gigawatts of wafer production. The firm said it expects revenue of $2.8 billion to $3 billion as it ships 1.45 to 1.55 gigawatts of solar wafers. Losses for major European stock indexes deepened in late trading Monday. In Paris, the CAC 40 index slipped 1.01% to 4,355.87. Germany's DAX index fell 0.72% to 6,296.95. The London stock market was closed for a holiday. Major Asian indexes were higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 index added 1.68% to 12,878.66. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index rallied 3.5% to 21,104.79. Treasury market Treasury prices were surging Monday. The 10-year note was higher at 101-30/32 for a yield of 3.771%, while the 30-year bond climbed to 102 for a yield of 4.381%. Major indexes each felll nearly 2% as the health of major institutions continued to worry stock traders
