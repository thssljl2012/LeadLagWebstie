 SYDNEY, Aug 29 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar  eased on Friday as its U.S. counterpart benefited from surprisingly upbeat U.S. economic news even as domestic indicators stayed soft. The currency was also haunted by expectations the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will deliver its first rate cut in seven years early next week to support flagging growth. By 4:10 p.m., the Aussie dollar  was down at $0.8622/24, from $0.8679/82 late here on Thursday but above an 11-month low of $0.8493 hit earlier this week. The U.S. currency had gained across the board when U.S. econmic growth proved stronger than expected in the second quarter [nN28278433]. In contrast, Australia's report on gross domestic product out next week is expected to show growth slowing as high interest rates and rising living costs crimp consumption [nSYA22609]. The latest sign of softness came in on Friday with data showing total credit rose a modest 0.5 percent in July, as decade-high borrowing costs hurt appetite for credit. The data underpinned views that rates would be lowered soon to provide relief to debt-laden Australians. 'The weak credit numbers have been a key focus for the RBA, and will likely be used as part of the rationale when rates are cut next week,' said Tony Morriss, senior currency strategist at ANZ. 'Local rate cuts, weaker activity data and a darker outlook for global growth adds to the case for a test of $0.8500 for the Aussie, and a possible move lower further out.' Next week a slew of data and the central bank's statement accompanying its rate decision will hold the key for the Aussie. On Monday, second-quarter current account deficit and inventories data will shed more light on growth prospects. And on Tuesday, the RBA's board meets to decide on interest rates. Futures  are pricing in a quarter percentage point rate cut in the cash rate to 7.00 percent. Investors expect the RBA to lower it to around 6.5 percent by December and such steep cuts will diminish the Aussie's high yield allure. That offset the benefit from a rally in stock markets, that usually tend to help higher-yielding currencies like the Australian dollar. The Aussie eased to 94.08 yen from 94.48 yen  late here on Thursday. Australian bonds were mixed as cash moved into stocks, but the prospect of coming rate cuts supported the shorter end of the curve. Asian stocks were buoyed by the better-than-expected U.S. data, and followed Wall Street higher. Three-year bond futures  added 0.01 points to 94.34, while the 10-year bond contract  eased 0.015 points to 94.25.
