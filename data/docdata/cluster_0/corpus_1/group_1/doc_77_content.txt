 Investors dumped the pound when a gross domestic product (GDP) reading was revised to show it was unchanged in the three months to June from an initial estimate of 0.2 percent quarterly growth. Analysts had forecast a revision to 0.1 percent growth.That was the economy's worst quarterly performance since the second quarter of 1992 when it was in the throes of its last recession. 'Today's data increases the chance of a recession in the UK, so that's why sterling is under considerable pressure and that's why we think sterling will remain under pressure,' said Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank.At 3:18 p.m., the pound was down 1.1 percent on the day at $1.8586, having earlier plumbed a low of $1.8550. The euro climbed 0.5 percent to 79.69 pence after hitting a one-week high of 79.88 pence .On a trade-weighted basis, the pound dropped to 90.60, a level last seen in late 1996.Stop-loss selling and other technical factors probably contributed to sterling's steep slide, according to traders, who noted the reaction in short sterling interest rate futures was far more subdued.While a short-term rebound may be on the cards, analysts believe the pound will extend its slide in the months ahead. 'We think the flow of news is going to continue to be negative for sterling,' said Adarsh Sinha, currency strategist at Barclays Capital, which is expecting the euro to rise to 82 pence over the next three months. 'The market will have to price in the risk of a rate cut sooner rather than later and more rate cuts than it has priced in right now. Our central view is the first cut will occur in November.' Markets have priced in about a 60 percent chance of a 25 basis point cut to the Bank of England's 5.0 percent benchmark rate by November. 'We had expected for some time that the BoE would cut the Bank Rate to 4.0 percent by Q3 2009. We now add a further cumulative 50 basis points of easing to take rates down to 3.50 percent by end-2009,' said Matthew Sharratt, an economist at Bank of America.(Reporting by Ian Chua, editing by Swaha Pattanaik)
