 TOKYO: Japan?s central bank painted a gloomy picture of Asia?s largest economy yesterday, warning growth will remain sluggish as it held its super-low interest rates steady for an 18th straight month.The unanimous decision to leave the benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5% had been widely expected after the economy contracted in the second quarter of 2008, leaving Japan teetering on the brink of recession.?There is a high possibility that the economy will continue to be sluggish for a while,? said Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Masaaki Shirakawa.The timing of an economic recovery appears to have been pushed back, although the current downturn should be relatively mild, he said.?We still think that the possibility of a big decline in the economy is quite small,? he told a press conference.While economic growth has stalled in Japan, inflation is running at the fastest pace in a decade.The central bank would like to rein in soaring prices but fears that higher borrowing costs would squeeze the economy.?Despite the lower economic assessment, the possibility of a rate cut remains highly unlikely,? noted Barclays Capital economist Kyohei Morita.Morita expects the BoJ?s next rate move to be a quarter point hike in the second quarter of 2009.The BoJ said the main culprits for the current sluggish growth were high commodity prices and weak export growth.But the bank said Japan, the world?s second largest economy, should eventually resume its recovery from recession in the 1990s as oil prices ease and the world economy stabilises.?While growth will likely remain sluggish for the time being, it is expected to return gradually onto a moderate growth path as commodity prices level out and overseas economies move out of their deceleration phase,? it said.Japan?s government earlier this month effectively declared an end to the country?s longest period of economic expansion in postwar times. ?
