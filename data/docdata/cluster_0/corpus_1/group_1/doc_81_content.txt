  By Jamie Dunkley and Rupert NeateEquity markets in the UK are likely to recover over the next few months, analysts have claimed, despite 'volatile' market conditions continuing into 2009.Barclays and HSBC said they expect the value of the FTSE 100 to rise by the end of 2008, with bigger improvements predicted next year.The value of the FTSE 100 market has fallen by 17pc so far this year, as the global economic crisis continues to worsen, with the FTSE 250 falling 16pc during 2008.This is significantly weaker than 2007, when the FTSE 100 fell by 4.6pc and the FTSE 250 rose by 4pc.Today, both markets rose with the FTSE 100 increasing by 38.20 to 5358.60 and the FTSE 250 by 18.90 to 8886.50 just before lunch.Henk Potts, equity strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers, said he was positive about the outlook for equity markets - despite predicting an 8pc fall in value for the FTSE 100 market by the end of the year.He described this as a 'huge recovery' from its current position. Mr Potts added: 'We expect the FTSE 100 to be up 6pc in 2009, as we think the Bank of England will cut rates by a full 1pc, to 4pc, and I think materials, telecoms and financials will be key growth areas.' 'Investors should try and buy when the market is weak, but it is difficult when there is sentiment against the market. The key is to get investors to look through the poor sentiment to the find the fundamentals. It is not as bad as it looks.' Robert Parkes, equity strategist at HSBC said the bank expected the value of the FTSE 100 to increase to 6000 points by the end of 2008, although he warned equity markets would continue to be 'volatile' due to economic uncertainty next year. 'We expect the market to be volatile over the months ahead. This is because there is a lack of visibility in key areas and the outlook for economic growth is a concern. However, inflation spiked during the second quarter, so that will help on the interest rate front,' he said. 'We expect this to continue into next year and believe the market will trade within quite a huge range during this time.' In terms of the FTSE 250 market, Mr Parkes added that companies with a larger market capitalisation had less exposure to the UK markets and were likely to perform more strongly than others. 'For the FTSE 250, going back towards the end of 2006, we suggested it was time to return to the large caps. We felt large caps were the best bet to perform strongly and that has worked pretty well. They tick a lot of boxes and tend to have strong balance sheets. 'They also have a good global exposure, so we are more concerned about the performances of the mid and small cap companies, which are more exposed to the UK economy.'
