'As a commodity exporting nation, Australia is highly dependent on both the outlook for global growth and commodity prices,' Ms Hampton said from Wellington. 'It was a choppy session for the currency.' There were some positive US data on Friday night, with US industrial production up by 0.2 per cent in July, while a survey found manufacturing activity in New York state increased in the same month. Also, a University of Michigan/Reuters survey of consumer confidence was up in August. 'The data gave the US dollar some support, but I think people are starting to worry that maybe we will see a little bit of a breather in the US dollar rally,' Ms Hampton said. There is no significant local economic data due today, with the market focused on the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) August board meeting minutes due tomorrow. 'There have been a mixed bag of factors going on affecting the Australian dollar, but I do think it is really in a consolidation phase and it will wait for the RBA minutes for direction,' Ms Hampton said. Ms Hampton said she expected the dollar to trade between $US0.8720 and $US0.8590 during the local session.Share this article What is this?
