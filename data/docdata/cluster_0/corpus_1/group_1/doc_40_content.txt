 AFTER weeks of jawboning the banks, Treasurer Wayne Swan would have been relieved to take a call from National Australia Bank chief Ahmed Fahour late on Wednesday telling him he was about to fall into line on interest rates.Whether the NAB blinked as a result of political pressure or whether it was opportunistic marketing is a moot point.Mr Swan and thousands of mortgage holders have got what they wanted: a promise yesterday that if, as expected, the Reserve Bank cuts interest rates by 0.25 percentage points next month, the NAB will pass it on in full to its customers.The NAB has given no guarantees that it will pass on any subsequent reductions - and the RBA might go harder than the anticipated 0.25% next month.But its move has enabled the Treasurer to turn the screws on other major banks, and he was predictably blunt yesterday, telling them to take 'a good hard look at themselves'. 'I've made it very clear that I expect the banks to pass on official rate cuts,' Mr Swan said. The NAB's variable interest rate after the proposed cut would be 9.36%.Its announcement yesterday prompted a counter-strike by the Commonwealth Bank, which cut its fixed-rate mortgages for the second time in a fortnight.But the Commonwealth gave no undertaking to pass on the full September rate cut to borrowers. It said it would do its best 'to pass on as much as we can to our customers'. Other major banks have said they will pass on the full rate cut only if it is responsible to do so.An ANZ spokeswoman said yesterday: 'We will pass on any reduction in the Reserve Bank's cash rate to ANZ's variable home loan rates as funding costs allow.' Westpac executives giving evidence before a parliamentary inquiry also refused to make any commitments. Kelvin Lawrence, who looks after Westpac mortgages, said it was not possible to say whether the bank would pass on interest rate cuts.Market analysts remain unsure whether the RBA will cut rates by 0.25 percentage points in September followed by another 0.25 percentage point cut in October, or whether it will go for a big hit of half a percentage point next month.First home buyers would save on average $101 a month if it cuts rates by 0.5 percentage points, according to figures from the Housing Industry Association.The banks have been under intense political pressure from Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Mr Swan, and from the Reserve Bank, to move faster in providing mortgage relief.The NAB's Mr Fahour said yesterday's announcement was not made in response to political pressure and was not a public relations exercise to capitalise on the reluctance of competitors to guarantee interest rate relief. 'This is a pretty serious issue and we have no space or time for cheap games,' he said. 'When I was getting my hair cut, the barber asked me if there was any chance of a rate cut and there is no question it is on the top of a lot of people's minds. The Reserve Bank is sending out a message that they are intending to do so and it would give me great pleasure to follow suit.' Mr Fahour, who is close to both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, called on the Government to reduce marginal tax rates on deposit accounts.Mr Swan responded favourably to that idea, suggesting it would be considered in the Henry review of taxation.New figures from the Reserve Bank, meanwhile, showed the total value of credit and charge card transactions, including advances, rose by 0.64% in June.Australians spent $18.38 billion on their credit and charge cards, up from $18.26 billion the previous month.Total credit and charge card balances outstanding rose by 1.1% to $44.71 billion, from $44.22 billion in May. Balances accruing interest rose by 2.6% to $32.798 billion in June from $31.970 billion in May. Credit card repayments fell by 0.5% to $18.150 billion in June, from $18.234 billion in May.With AAP
