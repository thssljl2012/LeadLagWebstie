 Demands for bigger paypackets remain restrained despite inflationary pressures and the higher cost of living, a survey shows.The Melbourne Institute Wages report found total pay rose 4.9 per cent in the 12 months to August, down from 7.5 per cent in the year to May.Over the same period, the basic hourly wage grew at 4.4 per cent.Melbourne Institute research fellow Edda Claus said high energy and food prices were not feeding into wages.'This gives the RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia) room for a loosening in monetary policy in response to the current weakening in domestic activity,' Dr Claus said in a statement.In terms of wage expectations, the survey of 1200 households expected a modest 3.1 per cent increase in total pay, which was unchanged from the previous survey.The RBA raised interest rates four times between August last year and March, lifting the cash rate to a four-year high of 7.25 per cent.Consumer price index headline inflation was 1.5 per cent in the June quarter, for an annual rate of 4.5 per cent, the largest annual increase in 12 and a half years.The report found those on individual contracts had a pay rise of 9.1 per cent, above the 6.1 per cent increase for those on enterprise agreements.
