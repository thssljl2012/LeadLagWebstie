 An increasing number of economic forecasters have brought forward their predictions of interest rate cuts to as early as next month - but they warn there is no guarantee that banks will follow.The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) yesterday left rates on hold at 7.25 per cent but signalled that it is ready to start lowering rates.ANZ and Westpac are forecasting a cut next month, while National Australia Bank and Commonwealth Bank say it is a possibility.Westpac's chief economist Bill Evans says the RBA board believes the economy is weaker than before, and has made the case to cut rates next month. 'The Reserve Bank has left the door open to cut rates next month, clearly if there were some unforseen events between now and the next board meeting then that would not happen,' he said. 'But we don't expect that there would be any developments on the data front, particularly on the wages front that will be out next week, that would stop them cutting rates, given the indications that we got from the governor's statement.' There is speculation the RBA's first rate cut could be as much as 0.5 per cent.Economists are warning there is no guarantee banks will cut their borrowing rates even if the Reserve Bank lowers official rates and RBC Capital Markets' senior economist Su-Lin Ong says that could prompt the RBA to make the 0.5 per cent cut. 'The risk that the banks won't fully pass on the interest rate moves from the RBA is a very strong argument for the RBA to be more aggressive,' she said. The Reserve Bank rarely changes rates by more than 0.25 per cent, with only one 0.5 per cent shift in the last 16 rate moves. Ms Ong says private sector banks have signalled they remain under pressure to lift interest rates regardless of official movements. 'Very much there is a risk that when the Reserve Bank delivers a 25 points of easing that the banks won't fully pass that on to key lending rates such as the standard variable mortgage rates,' she said.
