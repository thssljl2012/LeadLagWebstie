 THE dollar has opened higher after oil prices rose during the overnight session, but gains were limited in quiet conditions.At 7am AEST, the dollar was trading at $US0.8735/38, up from yesterday's close of 0.8716/20. Overnight, the local currency traded between a low of $US0.8676 and a high of 0.8743. A rise in the price of crude oil supported the dollar overnight - crude oil for September delivery rose $US0.45 to settle at $114.98 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.The contract, which expired last night, reached an intra-day high of $US117.03, before dropping to $US112.61 after US data showed US crude oil inventories rose by 9.4 million barrels in the week ending August 15. Wells Fargo currency strategist Vassili Serebriakov said the currency market mostly tracked oil prices during the overnight session, but moves were limited in quiet conditions and limited economic data. 'In the current environment it is hard to find any specific triggers for these moves,' Mr Serebriakov said from New York. 'We're in the summer doldrums.' Mr Serebriakov said the dollar was the worst performing currency against the US dollar since July 15, as judged by the US dollar index. But he said the currency, which fell from $US0.9849 on July 16 to $US0.8593 on August 13, had the potential to move towards $US0.8900. 'I think we're seeing consolidation but personally I think that there's scope for a rebound in the Aussie dollar,' he said. Mr Serebriakov said there would also be a pullback from the US dollar's rapid appreciation over the same period. 'The US dollar is consolidating after what we saw in the last couple of weeks, which were fairly dramatic moves,' Mr Serebriakov said. 'We think this pullback is going to happen eventually in the short term, however the overall sentiment remains US dollar positive.' The Reserve Bank of Australia releases its monthly bulletin today, while the Australian Bureau of Statistics publishes new motor vehicle sales for July. Both are due at 11.30am AEST. Mr Serebriakov said he expected the dollar to be range bound during today's local session.
