 Analysts who expect the key cash rate to be cut next month will be watching with interest when the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) releases its August 5 board meeting minutes.The RBA appeared to have a marked change of heart about the economic outlook at its August meeting.It has already clearly indicated it intends to cut the official rate because of a rapid slowdown in economic growth.Financial markets expect the first move to come next month.Some economists believe last month's independent rate increases by the retail banks will force the RBA to act quickly in lowering rates for fear of crippling the economy.Lehman Brothers Australia chief economist Stephen Roberts said Tuesday's minutes may show whether there was any discussion about cutting the cash rate at the August 5 meeting.'It may be interesting to see whether there was any ... discussion about the size of rate cuts and their relationship to bank lending rates, which seem to have become the interest rates that the RBA has become most interested in for policy purposes,' Mr Roberts said.Financial markets are betting on a quarter percentage point cut in the 7.25 per cent cash rate at the RBA's September 2 meeting, and at least one further one before the end of the year.The commercial banks have increased their lending rates by around 0.55 percentage points on top of the two increases made by the RBA this year, blaming the increases on the global credit crunch which has forced up their own borrowing costs.Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan said the retail banks would be putting the economy at risk if they didn't match any interest rate cut by the Reserve.'There is absolutely no excuse for banks not to pass an official rate cut from the reserve bank in full, should that occur,' Mr Swan said.'Absolutely no excuse.'
