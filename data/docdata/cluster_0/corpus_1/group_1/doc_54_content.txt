 A reduction in petrol prices in recent weeks has soothed consumer fears about inflation, allowing inflationary expectations to fall back from the highest levels in 15 years, a survey shows.And for the first time in eight months, more people now expect inflation to fall back within the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) two to three per cent target band.The Melbourne Institute (MI) survey of consumer inflationary expectations, which is based on a poll of 1,200 people, shows the median inflation expectation was 4.9 per cent in August.That was down from the July median expectation reading of 5.9 per cent, which was the highest level since the survey began in June 1993.MI research fellow Sam Tsiaplias said lower crude oil prices and income tax cuts are calming consumer worries about inflation. 'There is little doubt that the significant decline in inflationary expectations in August is associated with the steep fall in crude oil prices over the last month,' he said. 'The effect of income tax cuts and the path of crude oil prices are significant factors in determining future inflationary expectations.' Crude oil prices have fallen by 21 per cent since hitting a record $US147 a barrel on July 12.Petrol prices in major capital cities have fallen below $1.50 a litre.As well, more survey respondents expect inflation to fall back within the RBA's target band, with 8.8 per cent expecting this scenario in August compared with 7.5 per cent in July.In the June quarter, the headline consumer price index rose 1.5 per cent, for an annual rate of 4.5 per cent. The RBA doesn't expect inflation to fall back within its band until 2010.NSW had the highest median inflation expectation of 7.3 per cent.
