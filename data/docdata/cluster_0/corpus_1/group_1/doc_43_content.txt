 WELLINGTON, Aug 26 (Reuters) - The New Zealand dollar sat near 10-day lows on Tuesday as investors shunned risky investments and high-yield currencies amid renewed financial market worries.The kiwi fell for a second day as the failure of a U.S. bank, the ninth this year, and the bail-out of a Danish bank showed global credit turmoil is still having an impact.The developments overshadowed local data showing little improvement in the country's yawning trade deficit and a central bank survey showing inflation expectations at 17-year highs. 'The NZ dollar is looking vulnerable heading into the London session, particularly if the next key support level of 0.6950 fails to hold as well,' said ANZ-National Bank senior markets economist Khoon Goh in a market note.At 0500 GMT the New Zealand dollar was at $0.6967/72 from $0.7047/51 in late local trading on Monday. It traded a local range of $0.6960 to $0.7049.The kiwi was sold along with the Aussie dollar as investors in carry trades -- borrowing in low yielding yen to invest in high yielding NZ assets -- trimmed their exposures amid the financial market concerns.Sentiment towards the kiwi was soured early by the worse-than-expected July month trade deficit of NZ$781 million ($542 million), the highest in 11 months. The annual deficit narrowed less than expected to NZ$4.44 billion. See [nWEL000738]. 'There are no implications for monetary policy and the data should be neutral for rates, slightly negative for the NZ dollar,' said RBC Capital Markets senior economist Su-Lin Ong.The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) quarterly inflation survey showed expectations at their highest level in 17 years, with consumer prices seen rising 3.6 percent this year and 3 percent the year after. That compared with 3.3 percent and 2.9 percent in the May survey. See [nWEL65006]. 'While today's data will not cause a re-think about RBNZ policy for the rest of this year, it is a reminder that inflation concerns are still in the background even as the RBNZ embarks on the easing cycle,' ANZ-National's Goh said.The RBNZ's next monetary statement is on Sept. 11 with a Reuters poll showing all 17 economists surveyed expecting a quarter point cut to 7.75 percent.Near term the kiwi is seen supported at $0.6920 and below that $0.6900, with $0.7000/10 the initial resistance.Investors are expected to be watching for a flurry of upcoming data including the German Ifo survey of business sentiment and U.S. new home sales.New Zealand bonds extended opening gains to close firmer along the yield curve as investors sought the safe haven of government debt.The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond , which moves inversely to the price, was four basis points lower at 6.05 percent.
