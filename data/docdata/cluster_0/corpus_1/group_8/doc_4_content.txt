SYDNEY, March 9 (Reuters) - Australian shares turned negative  on Monday, erasing earlier gains after financials extended  losses, led by the nation's top lender National Australia Bank .  'There's just so much ambiguity there still...there does not  seem to be any concrete, unambiguous resolution, or way forward  for financials offshore, and as long as that's the case it's  going to be very hard for our financials to make headwind  themselves,' said Peter Wright, dealer at Burrell&amp;Co.  The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 index was down 4 points, or  0.1 percent at 3,141.5 at 0215 GMT.  New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index also turned  negative, down 0.2 percent to 2,466.6 at 0215 GMT.  STOCKS ON THE MOVE  * The majority of financial stocks fell, led by a 4.4 percent  fall in NAB to A$16.06. No. 3 lender, Commonwealth Bank of  Australia was down 1.5 percent at A$26.60.  0215 GMT  * Fortescue Metals Group Ltd rose 2.8 percent to  A$2.57, off highs of A$2.66 earlier in the day, after it  announced heavy rains this month across northwestern Australia's  iron ore belt had impacted production.  0155 GMT  * Global miners BHP Billiton Ltd and Rio Tinto rose 5.1 percent and 4.7 percent to A$29.06 and A$47.83  respectively.
