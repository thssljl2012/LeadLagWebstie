(Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei average dropped 3.5 percent to hit a four-month closing low on Friday, with shares falling across the board, after General Motors (GM.N) warned of possible bankruptcy and concerns intensified over the U.S. financial sector.  Japan's Financial Services Agency plans to extend curbs on short-selling of stocks beyond the end of this month, two sources familiar with the matter said, but the news appeared to have little impact on the stock market, analysts said. [ID:nT92242]  Market participants have said buying by what they believe to be public pension funds has been supporting the benchmark when it approaches the 26-year low of 6,994.90 hit in late October.  U.S. stocks slid on Thursday with the Dow and S&amp;P falling to 12-year lows, with shares of Citigroup (C.N), once the world's largest bank by market value, trading below $1 for the first time. [ID:nN05328477]  In Tokyo, Monex Group Inc (8698.T) lost over 7 percent after a newspaper reported Citigroup plans to sell its 26 percent stake in the Japanese online broker as part of the struggling U.S. bank's efforts to raise cash. [ID:nT172464]  Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd (7270.T) tumbled 7 percent after the maker of Subaru brand cars said it has applied for a low-interest loan offered by the state-run Development Bank of Japan to finance its business.  The benchmark Nikkei ended down 260.39 points at 7,173.10.  On the week, the Nikkei lost 5.2 percent, its worst performance in six weeks -- since week ending January 23.  Buoyed by hopes for bigger economic stimulus plans in China, it had gained 2 percent the previous day, the first time it has risen for two straight days since late January.  The broader Topix declined 2.7 percent to 721.39, a fresh 25-year closing low.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan's top lender, shed 4.8 percent to 401 yen and No. 2 Mizuho Financial Group (8411.T) retreated 4.9 percent to 176 yen.  Shipping firms such as Mitsui OSK (9104.T), which had recently gained on hopes for economic stimulus in China, were among the biggest losers while exporters also tumbled.  Mitsui OSK dropped 7.8 percent to 463 yen, Kawasaki Kisen (9107.T) slid 6.8 percent to 287 yen and Nippon Yusen (9101.T) lost 7.2 percent to 376 yen.
