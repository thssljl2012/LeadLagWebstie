THE Australian share market rebounded yesterday after big gains on global markets, inspired by a return to profits for Citigroup. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 index closed up 59.9 points or 1.9 per cent at 3244.4 after hitting a seven-day high of 3265.4. It was the first successive rise in almost four weeks.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 5.8 per cent earlier yesterday, helped by a bullish internal note on Citigroup from its chief executive.   Most traders still doubted the health of Citigroup, but they felt global markets were ripe for a bear market rally, noting the Dow had fallen 27 per cent in two months.   Wall Street's rise carried into Asia, where Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 4.3 per cent and S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.9 per cent in late trading despite worse-than-expected Chinese trade data.   Chinese exports fell 25.7 per cent in February versus market expectations of a 6.7 per cent fall, but traders were not convinced that data alone would derail the bear market rally. 'The whole world's in trouble so I don't know why anyone thought China's exports would be immune,' said a senior trader at a major brokerage.   Traders were anxious to see if Wall Street could rise for a second day. The rise in Tuesday trade was the biggest one-day gain since late November.   They said a bear market rally was probably under way, though they were reluctant to predict a durable bottom. 'It's encouraging that the market can have a relief rally,' said Goldman Sachs JBWere senior sales trader Patrick Crabb. 'But I think before you can get significant asset allocation changes the market needs to consolidate. 'The long-only community would like to see some sort of a base form before they take big bets.' Mr Crabb said short-covering from traders and modest buying from long-only funds in offshore markets was being followed by similar activity in Australia.   Heavyweight financials and resources boosted the market.   ANZ rose 3.2 per cent to $13.15, Commonwealth Bank rose 3 per cent to $28.61 and Westpac was up 2.6 per cent to $16.87, while National Australia Bank rose just 2c to $16.30 amid cautious trading before today's trading update.   Recently beaten-up financials made a comeback, with AMP up 6.2 per cent to $3.95, Axa up 4.9 per cent to $2.99 and Macquarie Group up 4.5 per cent to $18.26.   In resources, BHP rose 4.2 per cent to $30.50 and Rio Tinto rose 3.1 per cent to $49.80, while gold stocks were hit by a lower gold price, with Lihir down 6.2 per cent to $2.86.   The industrials sector was strongest, with Brambles up 6 per cent at $4.96, Qantas up 8 per cent at $1.545 and Macquarie Airports adding 8 per cent at $1.63.   Energy stocks were hit by a lower oil price. Santos lost 2.8 per cent at $15.92, while Woodside dropped 10c at $36.99.
