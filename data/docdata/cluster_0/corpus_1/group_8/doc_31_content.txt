MELBOURNE, March 12 (Reuters) - Australian stocks eased 0.3 percent on Thursday as concerns over a gloomy economic outlook at home and overseas induced caution, though gains for National Australia Bank offered support. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 index dropped 8.9 points to 3,235.5, based on the latest available figures, breaking two days of gains which added 2.8 percent to the index. New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index fell 5.9 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,491.6. The nation's central bank cut interest rates to an all-time low of 3 percent on Thursday, but signalled the easing cycle was close to an end..
