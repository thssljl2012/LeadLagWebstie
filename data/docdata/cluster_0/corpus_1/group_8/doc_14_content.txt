NEW YORK -- Stock markets were modestly higher Friday morning as investors reckoned that dismal U.S. jobs data for February could have been worse. Toronto's S&amp;P/TSX composite index moved up 75.1 points to 7,704.2 as the U.S. Labour Department said the economy shed 651,000 jobs last month -- just slightly above expectations -- while the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 8.1 per cent from 7.6 per cent in January.   The Dow Jones industrials gained 51.1 points to 6,645.6 following a 281-point loss even as the data also showed that jobless numbers for the two previous months were far bigger than expected.   Revised data released Friday show U.S. job losses in December totalled 681,000, against the original 577,000 figure, while 655,000 jobs were lost in January, not the 598,000 originally reported. The market had 'anticipated bad news, and we got it,' said Rob Lutts, president of Cabot Money Management in New York. But 'my sense is, we haven't discounted all the negatives out there as of yet.' The Canadian dollar is up 0.35 of a cent US to 77.97 cents US.   The Nasdaq composite index added 6.51 points to 1,306.1 after losing 54 points while the S&amp;P 500 index moved ahead seven points to 689.55 after losing 30 points on worries about U.S. bank downgrades, the future of General Motors Corp. and some disappointment that China did not unveil fresh stimulus measures.   Indexes in Toronto and New York are down sharply this week, with the Dow industrials plunging to 1997 levels and the TSX at 2003 lows.   Many analysts believe there is little keeping stocks from falling even further as worries about the automotive and financial sectors continue to weigh on investors.
