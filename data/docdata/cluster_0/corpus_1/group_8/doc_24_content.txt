(Adds property trusts, oil companies)  MELBOURNE, March 10 (Reuters) - Australian stocks were little changed on Tuesday, recovering from earlier losses as gains in the top four banks and biggest property groups helped to offset slippage in top miner BHP Billiton . The prospect of another interest rate cut helped the market, after job ads plunged by a record in February and a survey showed the worst business conditions since the recession of the early 1990s.

New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index  fell 0.5 percent to 2,456.8.  STOCKS ON THE MOVE  * Oil and gas companies boosted the market, as oil prices jumped above $47 a barrel.
