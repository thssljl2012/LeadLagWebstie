* European grains in thin wait-and-see trading  (Updates after European markets open, pvs SYDNEY)  PARIS/SYDNEY, March 10 (Reuters) - U.S. soybeans futures rose more than 1 percent on Tuesday as cash soybean markets firmed on exporter buying, boosting near-month contracts.  Wheat and corn futures also crept higher on position-squaring ahead of Wednesday's release of the United States Department of Agriculture's March world agricultural supply and demand estimates (WASDE).  'There's a little bit of positioning ahead of the USDA report and we're also seeing the firmer oil price having some effect on the grains,' said Toby Hassall, an analyst at Commodity Warrants Australia.  Chicago Board of Trade soybeans for March delivery rose 1.31 percent to $8.92-1/2 per bushel by 1145 GMT, marking three straight days of gains while front month corn advanced 0.84 percent to $3.60-1/4 per bushel, recovering from 3-month lows struck last week.  Chicago grain and soybean March contracts expire on March 13, but prices traded on May had similar trends.  Soybean futures were also underpinned by higher U.S. cash prices as exporters sought stock to fill orders. U.S. growers were reported to be holding back from selling soybeans hoping for prices above $9 per bushel.  Chinese buyers are expected to soon turn to new crops in Brazil as the harvest there gathers momentum. About a quarter of the Brazilian bean crop has been harvested but rain will slow progress this week.  In the United States, farmers are deciding whether to plant corn or soybeans in coming weeks. The balance is likely to be tipped in favour of soybeans because the crop has lower input costs on a per-acre basis.  Wheat for March delivery was flat at $5.15-3/4 per bushel, while the more-active May contract rose 0.53 percent to $5.26, buoyed by concerns that dry weather in the U.S. southwest grain belt might harm the hard red winter wheat crop, though rain is forecast for later in the week.  In Europe sharp gaps could be seen between front-month March wheat contracts on its last day of trading, with a rise of 3.75 euros or 2.7 percent at 145 euros a tonne, and May down 0.25 euro at 138 euros a tonne.  Operators who were short of March ahead of its expiry were forced to pay a premium to cover themselves, traders noted.  Bunge's purchase of 25,000 tonnes of Russian wheat for delivery to Brazil's northeast in May, was a sign that Brazilian mills were prepared to find alternatives to scarce Argentine wheat this year.  The poor global economic outlook has seen hedge funds bet that commodity prices will move lower because of ample stocks and shrinking demand as the world economic crisis deepens.  National Australia Bank global head of commodities Tim Glass said funds had built large short positions in recent weeks.  'If we don't test the short stops, I think the overall looseness of the (grain) balance sheets and the amount of corn and soybeans that growers still have to sell in the U.S. will limit any ridiculous rally,' he said.  Corn was in favour following talk that the United States might increase the portion of ethanol used in gasoline blends.  But Glass said grower selling was likely to be triggered around the $4 per bushel, considered an attractive level to sell remaining corn stocks from the last harvest.
