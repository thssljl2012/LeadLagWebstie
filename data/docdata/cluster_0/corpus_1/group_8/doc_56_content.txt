THE share market was at a five year low at noon, dragged down by QBE Insurance and Rio Tinto as uncertainty about the US government's response to its weak economy weighed on prices.  At 12.00pm (AEDT) on Monday, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 99.2 points, or 2.97 per cent, at 3245.3, the lowest since December 2003.  The broader All Ordinaries index had shed 97.5 points, or 2.96 per cent, to 3199.4. 'Uncertainty is driving the market right now,'' Man Financial broker Anthony Anderson said. 'There's uncertainty about the economy and about what the US Government is going to do about the problems.''  Mr Anderson said QBE fell after brokers Credit Suisse, UBS and Merrill Lynch downgraded their profit forecasts for Australia's biggest insurance company.  Rio fell on the ongoing uncertainty about the Chinalco deal, he said.   The Chinese company said it would meet Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) officials on Monday.   ''(QBE is) a strong company (but) three broker downgrades are never going to help anyone,'' Mr Anderson said. 'There's uncertainty about the Rio deal and Chinalco said the funding will be daunting,' he said. 'The government approval isn't a given either.''   QBE shares slumped $2.07, or 10.86 per cent, to $16.99.  Fellow insurer Suncorp-Metway fell 9.32 per cent to $4.77 and Insurance Australia Group dropped 4.65 per cent to $3.28.  Miners were lower.   Rio slid 6.58 per cent to $44.14 while its rival, BHP Billiton lost 3.99 per cent to $27.68.  The banks also fell.  NAB lost 51 cents to $17.37, Commonwealth Bank shed $1.23 ti $28.57, Westpac sank 39 cents to $16.50, and ANZ was down 31 cents at $13.00.   Mr Anderson said Macquarie Group and some of its satellite funds fell as investors worried the asset valuations were too high.  Macquarie said several of its funds had sold or would sell assets to close the gap between the current security prices and the value of the underlying businesses.  Macquarie Group slumped 8.3 per cent to $15.57. Macquarie Airports lost 7.42 per cent to $1.435 and Macquarie Infrastructure fell 1.94 per cent, to $1.01.   The one bright area on the local stock exchange was the gold miners, which gained as the price of the precious metal advanced.  Newcrest gained 5.42 per cent to $32.66, Newmont jumped 9.52 per cent to $6.79 and Lihir added 4.85 per cent, to $3.46.   At 10.18am, the spot price of gold in Sydney was $US949.65 per fine ounce, up $US8.70 on Friday's local close of $US940.95.   In New York on Friday, the Dow fell 119.15, or 1.7 per cent, to 7062.93 as sentiment was dented by data showing a deep contraction in the US economy and a deal to boost the government stake in troubled banking giant Citigroup.   On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was down 90 points at 3227 on a volume of 13,160 contracts.   More to come.
