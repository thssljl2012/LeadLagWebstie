Global crude futures traded lower Monday as the slump in equity markets impacted sentiment, sources said. 'The oil market has taken a bit of a setback this morning, on weaker stocks, particularly the news of [a possible bailout to insurance giant] AIG and [the rights issue at banking group] HSBC,' a London-based oil broker said. At 1124 GMT, front-month ICE Brent traded at $44.54/barrel, down $1.81. The front-month NYMEX WTI contract also lost value, trading $2.14 lower at $42.62/b. Equity markets turned sour in the morning session Monday as news of another possible bailout for AIG, estimated in the region of $30 billion, together with HSBC's rights offering put pressure on global equity bourses. The FTSE 100 was at 3,692 points, a 3.6% fall, in late-morning trading. 'The crude market continues to trade in the same sideways range, it continues to receive support by the ever-present threat of OPEC turning off the pumps, with the dismal economic climate providing the downward pressure,' the London-based broker said. 'Today's trading activity is in stark contrast with what happened last week, where equity markets traded lower, whereas the crude futures market recorded healthy gains over the course of the week,' he added. 'We suspect that prices will continue to remain in a $32-$50 trading range for the next several weeks, with the downside being supported by the likelihood that OPEC will again sanction another cut at its upcoming meeting on the 15th,' energy analyst Edward Meir said in an MF Global report. In the product markets, the new front-month RBOB and heating oil contracts both traded lower, at $1.3333/gal and $1.2260/gal respectively. --George Johnson, george_johnson@platts.com For more news, request a complimentary trial to Platts Forward Curve Oil at http://getforwardcurveoil.platts.com
