THE dollar was higher at noon as financial markets continue to react favourably to reports that US bank Citigroup had operated profitably in January and February of this year.  At 12.00pm (AEDT), the dollar was trading at $US0.6480/83, up from yesterday's close of $US0.6382/86.  Since 7.00am, the unit has moved between $US0.6414 and $US0.6492.  In a memo to staff, Citigroup chief executive Vikram Pandit said the US bank had been profitable for the first two months of 2009 and was having its 'best quarter-to-date performance since the third quarter of 2007''.  Wall Street stocks rallied on the news with the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average closing up 5.7 per cent.  Senior dealer with online currency trading firm EasyForex, Francisco Solar, said the dollar was benefiting from an improvement in investor sentiment toward higher risk assets such as equities and commodities-based currencies.   Local bourses were higher at noon, with the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index up 1.95 per cent and the broader All Ordinaries index adding 1.85 per cent. 'It is not surprising considering the stellar performance overnight in New York on the back of Citigroup announcing a profit for the first two months of 2009,'' Mr Solar said. 'That caused a nice rally in financial stocks, which helped prop up equity market indices. 'That flow on into Asia is helping keep the Aussie relatively buoyant.''  Stronger equity markets in Asia would continue to boost the dollar for the rest of the local session, Mr Solar said. 'As the (Japanese) Nikkei is still powering into the afternoon, that is keeping the Aussie well supported,'' he said.  Mr Solar forecasts the dollar to trade between $US0.6415 and $US0.6550 for the rest of the Asian session.  The Reserve Bank of Australia's trade weighted index was at 55.2, up from yesterday's close of 54.6.  Meanwhile, the bond market was weaker at noon.  The yield on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was 4.363 per cent, up from yesterday's close of 4.255 per cent, while the yield on the April 2012 bond was at 3.140 per cent, up from yesterday's close of 3.067 per cent.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March 10-year bond futures contract price was 95.665, down from yesterday's close of 95.765, while the March three-year bond futures contract was at 96.880, down from yesterday's close of 96.945.
