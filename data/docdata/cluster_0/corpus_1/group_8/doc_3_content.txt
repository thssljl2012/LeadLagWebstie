STOCKS slipped into the red this afternoon, erasing early gains as negative economic data prompted profit-taking. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 was down 15.9 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 3228.5 as the market headed into the last hour of trading.   The All Ordinaries was lower by 13.6 points to 3185.5.   National Australia Bank was a standout performer, up 2.7 per cent to $16.74, after the bank said it would slash its first-half dividend by about 25 per cent and seek to boost its Australian business as it eyes potential acquisitions thrown up by the global financial crisis.   ABN Amro sales trader James Trude said investors were relieved NAB did not announce asset write-downs.   Deteriorating global economic conditions were underscored by more grim data. Australias unemployment rate hit a four-year high of 5.2 per cent in February, Chinas industrial production slowed sharply in the first two months of the year and revised figures confirmed Japan had its worst performance in almost 35 years in the December quarter.
