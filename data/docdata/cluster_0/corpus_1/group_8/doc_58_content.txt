By Koh Gui Qing SYDNEY, March 18 (Reuters) - Australian stocks fell from a one-month high on Wednesday after miner Rio Tinto Ltd skidded 9 percent on a broker downgrade and on mounting concern over the fate of its proposed $19.5 billion deal with China's Chinalco. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 fell 5.6 points, or 0.16 percent, to 3,446.3, based on the latest available data. It had hit a one-month high of 3,487.5 earlier in the session. In New Zealand, the benchmark NZX 50 index rose 1.6 percent to 2,603.8. The biggest one-day drop since Dec. 12 in Rio shares came as political opposition intensified on Wednesday to its proposed tie-up with state-owned Chinalco, a deal seen to be crucial in helping Rio cut its $39 billion of outstanding debt. Some Australian politicians are uneasy over the prospect of Australia selling key assets to a foreign country. Selling pressure on Rio shares was further exacerbated by broker Goldman Sachs JBWere, which cut its rating for the stock to sell from hold. 'There is risk that the Chinalco deal isn't approved,' the broker said in a note to clients. 'As much as we don't like the Chinalco deal, if it's not approved now ... and without an attractive alternative, we would see this a negative for the share price,' it said. The broker also said weak aluminium prices could drag Rio's aluminium business into losses over the next two years. Rio, the world's third-biggest mining group, plunged 8.7 percent to A$47.50. Since the proposed tie-up with Chinalco was announced on Feb. 12, Rio shares have hit a high of $52, from a 5-1/2-year low of $29.91 struck in December. Michael Heffernan, a senior client adviser and strategist at Austock Group, said Rio could fall back towards A$30 if the Chinalco deal collapses, but added the recent buoyancy in stock markets should prevent the stock from testing its December lows. Other Australian mining stocks dropped. Traders said they sold shares in miners to raise money to buy bank stocks, which have been buoyed in recent days by a slight improvement in investor confidence in the global banking sector. BHP Billiton, the world's No. 3 iron ore miner, fell 2.6 percent to A$31.08. Newcrest Mining, Australia's top gold miner, dropped 2.3 percent to A$31.37. Investment bank Macquarie Bank rose 3.6 percent to A$22.63. Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the third-largest bank, rose 0.7 percent to A$32.90, and Westpac , Australia's No. 2 bank by assets, added 0.2 percent to A$17.74. But some analysts said the gains in bank stocks did not signal a convincing recovery in stock markets. 'It's a trader's market. You see people coming back to buy one day and to sell the next,' said Lucinda Chan, division director at Macquarie Equities. 'But global markets are still shaky out there. We need to see housing markets and unemployment trending up before we can talk about a recovery,' she said.
