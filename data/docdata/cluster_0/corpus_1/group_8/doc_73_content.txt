By Malcolm Morrison, The Canadian Press TORONTO - The Toronto stock market closed modestly lower Monday, adding to last week's steep losses with financial shares again leading the way downward. New York indexes also faded as investors looked in vain for hope amid indications of further global economic deterioration. Toronto's S&amp;P/TSX composite index closed 24.53 points lower to 7,566.94 with energy stocks providing lift as oil prices moved closer to US$50 a barrel. The TSX Venture Exchange stepped back 14.93 points to 814.19. The Canadian dollar was down 0.45 of a cent to 76.98 cents US, its weakest level since September 2004, on more glum economic data. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said annualized housing starts declined to 134,600 units in February, down from 153,500 in January and much worse than market expectations of 148,000. That continued the string of negative economic news, including the loss of 129,000 jobs in January, with the February number coming this Friday. Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial average dropped 79.89 points to 6,547.05, weighed down by a 7.7 per cent drop in component Merck, which offered to acquire Schering-Plough in a cash-and-stock deal valued at US$41.1 billion. Schering-Plough rose 14.2 per cent. The Nasdaq composite index was down 25.21 points at 1,268.64 while the S&amp;P 500 lost 6.85 to 676.53. The TSX lost 6.5 per cent last week, taking the main index to levels last seen in 2003 lows, while the Dow fell 6.2 per cent to 1997 levels. This prompted some analysts to say the market is ripe for a fairly big bounce. 'The odds of a short-term reversal are growing,' said Marc Groz, managing member of asset manager Topos LLC in New York. But traders found little to inspire optimism. The World Bank said Sunday that the global economy will shrink this year for the first time since the Second World War. The TSX financial sector stepped back 2.5 per cent, following a slide of almost 10 per cent last week. Monday's slide came despite an RBC Capital Markets briefing note that said recent bank earnings reports reinforce the view that 'despite tumultuous global markets, the Canadian financial sector has outperformed its global peers.' Royal Bank (TSX: RY.TO) declined 61 cents to $28.79. Insurers also racked up steep losses. Manulife Financial (TSX: MFC.TO) fell 45 cents to $9.20, down from over $40 a year ago. U.S. financials gained on a report that Bank of America Corp. could raise capital in the private sector. Bank of America advanced 61 cents to US$3.75. However, HSBC, Europe's largest bank, fell $1.24 or 4.9 per cent to US$24.26 in New York ahead of its offering of new shares. General Electric helped lift the Dow after Goldman Sachs said it expects GE Capital, the conglomerate's finance arm, to be near break-even this year. GE advanced 35 cents to US$7.41. The TSX energy sector rose 3.2 per cent as oil prices added to Friday's advance of almost US$2 a barrel. The April crude contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $1.55 to US$47.07 - its highest close in two months. 'The market clearly got oversold,' said Bob Tebbutt, vice-president at Peregrine Financial Group Canada. 'Was the market overpriced at US$147 a barrel? Maybe. Was the market underpriced at US$33? Maybe. But take a look at gasoline demand. In the last four weeks, versus the same four weeks a year ago, we're up three per cent.' Investors also anticipate another OPEC production cut will shrink global supplies. Suncor Inc. (TSX: SU.TO) ran up $2.94 to $30.29 and Canadian Natural Resources (TSX: CNQ.TO) advanced $1.60 to $43.40. Drilling and well-servicing equipment maker Wenzel Downhole Tools Ltd. reported 2008 profits of $12.4 million, up from $2.8 million in 2007 as revenue increased to $71.8 million from $54.2 million. Wenzel was up nine cents to 70 cents. The April bullion contract on the Nymex eased $24.70 to US$918 an ounce, taking the TSX gold sector down 2.5 per cent. Barrick Gold Corp. (TSX: ABX.TO) declined 72 cents to $36.24 while Goldcorp Inc. (TSX: G.TO) faded $1.26 to $36.56. The tech sector was also a leading decliner as Research In Motion Ltd. (TSX: RIM.TO) moved down 65 cents to $45.95 and Celestica Inc. (TSX: CLS.TO) gave back 26 cents to $3.41. Agrium Inc. (TSX: AGU.TO) gained $1.97 to $42.25 after CF Industries rejected the Canadian fertilizer company's unsolicited US$3.6-billion takeover bid as 'grossly inadequate.'
