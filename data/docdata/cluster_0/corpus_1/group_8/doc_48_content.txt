THE share market closed at its weakest level in almost six years, weighed down by banks and resources stocks following a drop in oil and base metals prices and a plunge on Wall Street. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 43 points, or 1.35 per cent, at 3,145.5, while the broader All Ordinaries index shed 37.1 points, or 1.18 per cent, to 3,111.7. It was the S&amp;P/ASX 200's weakest close since mid July 2003.   On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was 23 points lower at 3146 on a volume of 24,008 contracts.   IG Markets head of institutional dealing Chris Weston said BHP Billiton, Commonwealth Bank and Telstra were among the most heavily traded stocks. 'Financials could not escape the bleak sentiment that was mustered up by their US counterparts ... following a possible Moody's credit downgrade on JPMorgan and Citigroup,' Mr Weston said. 'Our domestic banks experienced a heavy sell-off.' Commonwealth Bank was down 33 cents at $27.00, Westpac eased nine cents to $15.70, National Australia Bank was three cents higher at $16.80 and ANZ retreated 29 cents to $12.36.   ANZ and Merrill Lynch have reached an in-principle $253 million settlement agreement with the liquidators of failed stockbroker Opes Prime and the corporate regulator.   Meanwhile, US shareholders of ANZ are mobilising as part of a class action alleging bank executives made false statements about the Opes Prime saga to inflate the bank's share price.   Mining giant BHP Billiton gave up 66 cents, or 2.33 per cent, to $27.65 while Rio Tinto was down five cents at $45.70.   Telstra, which went ex-dividend, dropped 13 cents, or 3.89 per cent, to $3.21 after chairman   Donald McGauchie said economic conditions were worsening.   Insurer QBE was a poor performer, losing 76 cents, or 4.45 per cent, to $16.30.   Energy stocks were mixed. Santos gained 52 cents to $15.20, Woodside climbed $1.35 to $35.55 and Oil Search inched one cent lower to $4.81.   Gold stocks were mixed. Newcrest was down six cents at $31.07, Newmont added eight cents to $6.16, Lihir Gold rose 15 cents to $3.15 and Sino Gold appreciated nine cents to $5.07.   The spot price of gold in Sydney was $US938.15 per fine ounce, up $US25.05 on Thursday's local close of $US913.10.
