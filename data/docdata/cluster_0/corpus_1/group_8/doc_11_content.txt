TOKYO, March 11 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei stock average gained 4.6 percent on Wednesday, its biggest percentage rise in six weeks, as financial shares climbed after Citigroup's chief executive said the U.S. bank was making profits.   Toshiba Corp surged more than 9 percent after a newspaper reported it may see an operating profit of about 100 billion yen ($1 billion) in the next business year, while other tech shares climbed in the wake of strong gains by their U.S. peers.   The benchmark Nikkei rose 321.14 points to 7,376.12, a day after posting a 26-year closing low. The broader Topix rose 2.7 percent to 722.28.
