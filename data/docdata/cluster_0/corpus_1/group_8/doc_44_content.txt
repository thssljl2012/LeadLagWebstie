The Australian share market has received mixed leads from overseas, with Wall Street down and precious and base metals lower, although oil gained.  In recent trading on the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March SPI futures index was down 15 points at 3,134. Yesterday, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index rose 9 points, or 0.3%, to 3154.5, while the broader All Ordinaries index gained 10 points to 3121.7.  Resource stocks may ease after the closely watched Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of commodity prices fell 0.6% overnight.  The Australian dollar retreated, trading recently at 63.26 US cents, down from yesterday's local close of 63.97 US cents. The dollar was also worth 45.85 pence, 50.1 euro cents and 62.45 yen.  Wall Street  With little good economic news or direction from Washington, the pessimism on Wall Street intensified on Monday, sending stocks lower.  The market seesawed early in the session as investors were torn between hopes for the financial sector and fears about the broader economy's slide. But stocks turned lower in the afternoon, following a now familiar pattern where short-lived bursts of optimism give way to concerns about the US's economic woes.  At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen 79.89, or 1.2%, to 6,547.05. The S&amp;P 500 index lost 6.85, or 1%, to 676.53, while the Nasdaq composite index had fallen 25.21, or 2%, to 1,268.64 - its lowest since 2002.  The main European markets ended higher.  In the UK, Britain's FTSE 100 index gained 11.67 points, or 0.33%, to 3,542.4 points, while Germany's DAX was 25.62 points, or 0.7%, higher at 3,692.03.  The CAC-40 in France was up 15.16 points, or 0.6%, at 2,519.29.  Local news  Local news may be dominated by fresh reports on the employment sector.  The National Australia Bank issues its business survey for February, and ANZ releases its job advertisements survey for February.  The Manpower-Melbourne Institute Employment Report for March is also due.  David Jones chief executive Mark McInnes and Australian National Retailers Association chief executive Margy Osmond announce their response to the second cash bonus on Tuesday morning.
