Stocks surged in early trading today despite a government report showing the country's unemployment rate topped 8 percent last month, the highest level in more than 25 years.   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.3 percent or 86 points, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.2 percent or 8 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq gained .2 percent or 3 points.   Despite today's bounce, the markets headed for another negative week with all of the indexes losing ground.   Investors appeared to shrug off a Labor Department report showing that the jobless rate rose from 7.6 percent in January to 8.1 percent in February, which is worse than analysts had expected. Employers shed 651,000 jobs last month, according to the report.   After trading below $1 a share yesterday, Citigroup was up 5 percent in early trading to about $1.07 a share. The rest of the financial sector also received a boost: Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase were up 10 percent and 5 percent, respectively. Wells Fargo surged 15 percent after announcing it would cut its dividend 85 percent to 5 cents a share, in a $5 billion a year cost savings move.   Overseas, London's FTSE and Germany's Dax rebounded from earlier losses after the labor report was released and were trading up more than 1 percent. But Japan's Nikkei was down 3.5 percent.   Crude oil prices also rebounded, gaining 3 percent to $44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
