STOCKS were in positive territory this afternoon as gains in miners and energy producers countered weakness in banks and insurers.  After a positive lead from Wall Street last Friday, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 was up 22.4 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 3167.9 and the All Ordinaries was 22.4 points higher at 3134.1.   Heavyweights BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Newcrest Mining and Woodside Petroleum were holding the market in the black even as QBE Insurance, AMP, IAG and National Australia Bank fell.   Around the region, Japanese shares were slightly higher in volatile trading after the country registered its first current account deficit in 13 years as the global financial crisis sapped demand for its exports.   The Nikkei 225 Index was up 0.4 per cent while Hong Kongs Hang Seng was down 2.4 per cent.
