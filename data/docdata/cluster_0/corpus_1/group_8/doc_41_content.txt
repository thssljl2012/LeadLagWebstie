 THE share market was firmly in the red at noon, weighed down by disappointing gross domestic product (GDP) figures, and losses among the banking and mining sectors.  At 12.01pm (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 59.6 points, or 1.85 per cent, at 3159.6, while the broader All Ordinaries index had lost 53.4 points, or 1.68 per cent, to 3118.  CommSec market analyst Juliette Saly said the local bourse was testing levels not seen since August 2003 in reaction to the announcement on Wednesday that Australia's GDP had contracted 0.5 per cent in the December quarter.  This is the first time Australia's economy has gone backwards since December 2000.  The news also sent the Australian dollar lower. 'The market fell further into the red immediately following the release of those GDP figures,'' Ms Saly said. 'It was quite a shock for the market: many were expecting a rise in the fourth quarter. 'It was down about one per cent at 11.30am and, as soon as the numbers were released, we've seen the market fall another 30 points, or one per cent.''  At 12.03pm, NAB had dipped 23 cents to $17.09, Commonwealth Bank had shed 78 cents to $27.51, Westpac had retreated 23 cents to $15.84 and ANZ was down 37 cents at $12.59.   Ms Saly said there was speculation that Macquarie Group could be planning more job cuts.   Shares in Macquarie Group were down 7 cents at $17.33.  Despite generally strong metals prices on the London Metal Exchange overnight, the mining giants were weaker.   BHP Billiton had given up 45 cents, or 1.65 per cent, at $26.84 while debt-laden rival Rio Tinto had fallen $1.29, or 2.93 per cent, to $42.73.   On the Sydney Futures Exchange at 1201 AEDT, the March share price index futures contract was down 22 points to 3,149 on volume of 16,974 contracts. More to come.
