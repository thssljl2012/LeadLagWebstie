TORONTO - The Toronto stock market capped a losing week that saw its key index hit multi-year lows with a negative close Friday following enormous job losses in the U.S. last month. New York indexes turned around in the last half hour of the session to close slightly higher amid some relief that the February non-farms payroll report wasn't worse. Toronto's S&amp;P/TSX composite index closed down 37.7 points to 7,591.47 after the U.S. Labour Department said the economy shed 651,000 jobs last month - just slightly above expectations - while the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 8.1 per cent from 7.6 per cent in January. Canada's jobless rate is 7.2 per cent but could shoot higher next Friday when Statistics Canada reports the February employment numbers. 'I don't know if it could have been a heck of a lot worse,' said Blair Falconer, portfolio manager at HSBC Securities. 'That was a poor number and they revised by over 100,000 jobs for December and January numbers.' The Dow Jones industrials gained 32.5 points to 6,626.94 as revised data show U.S. job losses in December totalled 681,000, more than 100,000 or 18 per cent higher than originally reported, while 655,000 jobs were lost in January, 57,000 more than originally reported. The TSX Venture Exchange was off 0.57 of a point to 829.12, while the Canadian dollar closed up 0.11 of a US cent to 77.73 cents U.S. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 5.74 points to 1,293.85 while the S&amp;P 500 index added 0.83 of a point to 683.38. Apple Inc. was a drag on the Nasdaq after analysts at JP Morgan recently lowered their price target for the company. Apple shares fell $3.54 to US$85.30 . The TSX finished the week down 531.55 points or 6.5 per cent to its worst level since the fall of 2003 while the Dow industrials fell 436 points or 6.17 per cent to 1997 lows. The week's losses were sparked by Monday's announcement by insurer American International Group Inc. of a US$62 billion loss - the biggest loss every for an American company. Sentiment was also depressed late in the week after General Motors' annual report said its auditors have raised 'substantial doubt' about the troubled automaker's ability to continue operations and disappointment that China didn't announce a new stimulus plan. Many analysts believe there is little keeping stocks from falling even further as worries about the automotive and financial sectors continue to weigh on investors.
