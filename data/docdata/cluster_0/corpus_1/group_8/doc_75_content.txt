* Nikkei falls 3.5 pct, hits 4-month closing low * Down 5.2 pct on week, the worst in six weeks * GM warning, financial sector worries hit confidence * Many believe public pension funds supporting market * Little impact from Japan's plan to extend short-selling curbs  TOKYO, March 6 (Reuters) - Tokyo's Nikkei average dropped 3.5 percent to hit a four-month closing low on Friday, with shares falling across the board, after General Motors (GM.N: Quote, Profile, Research) warned of possible bankruptcy and concerns intensified over the U.S. financial sector.

[ID:nN05328477]  The Nikkei fall was slightly less steep in than the 4 percent declines in the U.S. benchmarks, with market participants saying buying by what they believe to be public pension funds has been supporting the Nikkei when it approaches a 26-year low just under 7,000 in late October.  'Financial fears have resurfaced both in America and Europe,' said Takahiko Murai, general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities.  'Citi's stock price broke below $1, while UK institutions and others in Europe have lent money to peers in Eastern Europe where the economies are in extremely poor condition,' he said.  In Tokyo, Monex Group Inc (8698.T: Quote, Profile, Research) lost over 7 percent after a newspaper reported Citigroup plans to sell its 26 percent stake in the Japanese online broker as part of the struggling U.S. bank's efforts to raise cash.
