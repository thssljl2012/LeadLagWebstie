STOCKS wiped out early gains to finish in the red after Rio Tinto fell sharply on concerns over Chinalco's investment in the miner.  Despite a strong lead from Wall Street, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 fell for the first time in four days, losing 5.6 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 3446.3.   The All Ordinaries closed down 7.2 points at 3386.2.  The Australian dollar was trading at US66.09 cents, down from its intraday high of US66.29c, but up from yesterdays close of US65.98c.   Rio registered the biggest fall in the list of 200 biggest companies, shedding 8.7 per cent to $47.50, after Goldman Sachs slapped a sell recommendation on the miner, citing the risk of Chinalcos $US19.5 billion ($29.6 billion) investment not being approved by the Australian Government.   The Foreign Investment Review Board this week extended an investigation into the deal by 90 days.  Goldman Sachs analysts wrote: There is a risk that the Chinalco deal isnt approved. As much as we dont like the Chinalco deal, if its not approved now (after being supported by management and the board), and without an attractive alternative, we would see this as negative for the share price. ABN Amro Morgans investment adviser Bill Bishop said the uncertainty of the Rio deal was weighing on the share price. The market is concerned about the uncertainty about pricing and control, said Mr Bishop. Now, we are not going to know for at least three months and markets dont like uncertainty. Elsewhere in the sector, BHP Billiton fell 2.6 per cent to $31.08, Fortescue Metals dropped 6.2 per cent to $2.27 and Newcrest Mining lost 2.3 per cent to $31.37.   Strong gains in the financial sector put a floor under the weak market, as ANZ rose 2.6 per cent to $14.80, National Australia Bank gained 1.4 per cent to $19.19, Commonwealth Bank firmed 0.7 per cent to $32.70 and Westpac added 0.2 per cent to $17.74.   Macquarie Group jumped 3.6 per cent to $22.63 and AXA Asia Pacific rose 6.8 per cent to $3.44 after raising $500 million through an institutional placement.   Credit Suisse and JPMorgan lowered their target price for AXA Asia Pacific by $1 to $3.75 and $4, respectively, as the insurer seeks to raise as much as $890 million.   David Jones jumped 8.4 per cent to $2.70 after ringing up a $91.2 million net profit for the six months to January 24, compared with $89 million a year ago.   The market also drew support from investors covering their short positions before tomorrows expiry of the March SPI futures contract.
