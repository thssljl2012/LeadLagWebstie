THE top share index slid 5.3 percent yesterday to its lowest closing level in nearly six years, led by financials after HSBC's plan of a deep-discount rights issue and insurance giant AIG's huge quarterly net loss.  The FTSE 100 closed 204.26 points lower at 3,625.83, extending Friday's 2.2 per cent losses. It lost 7.7 per cent last month and is down 18 per cent for the year, after posting its worst full-year drop in 2008 since its launch in 1984.  Banks took the most points off the index as HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, tumbled 19 per cent to its lowest closing level since October 1998.  The bank booked an 18 per cent fall in 2008 adjusted pre-tax profit and announced a cut in dividend and a deeply discounted rights issue to raise about 12.5 billion.Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group and Standard Chartered sank between 2.6 per cent and 15.3 per cent.  RBS ended the day 2.6 per cent lower at 22.6p, while HBOS parent company Lloyds was the biggest faller, closing 15.3 per cent or 8.9p lower at 49.4p.'This is a market running very, very scared,' said Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners. 'There is just no good news out there.'AIG reported a $61.7 billion (43.87bn) fourth-quarter loss, the largest quarterly loss in US history, and reached a new government bailout deal after officials concluded the insurer was too big to be allowed to fail.  UK life insurers were mostly lower, with Prudential, Old Mutual, Standard Life and Aviva down between 5.7 per cent and 12 per cent.  Amlin was one of the four gainers, up 2.3 per cent after the insurer lifted its dividend and said the outlook for underwriting was improving. Motor insurer Admiral Group was also 2.3 per cent higher ahead of the release of its results today.'The capital raising from HSBC is obviously a major market focus,' said Darren Winder, equity strategist at Cazenove.'The big picture is still one of a profit picture which is under strong downward pressure and people are finding it very difficult to get comfortable with valuations against that sort of backdrop.'Commodity stocks were another standout faller on the UK index as prices in oil and metal slipped.  Oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell sagged 5.7 per cent and 6.2 per cent, ending the day at 422.75p and 1,450p respectively, while Cairn Energy fell 63p or 3.2 per cent at 1,898p and BG Group fell 55p or 5.5 per cent to 950p.  Among the miners, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Anglo American, Xstrata, Kazakhmys and Vedanta Resources fell between 4.9 per cent and 8.7 per cent.  Mid-cap property stock Segro plunged 24 per cent on fears it would soon launch a deeply discounted rights issue.   British Land slumped 12.6 per cent or 57.75p, closing at 400p, while Land Securities shed 9.2 per cent to close 50.75p lower at 498.25p. LONDON FTSE 100 CLOSE 3,625.8 -204.3
