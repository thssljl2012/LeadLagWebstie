The average price of gas in Philadelphia moved back up 1 cent overnight, according to AAA Mid-Atlantic.  The average for a gallon of regular no-lead stood at $1.98 this morning. The averages in South Jersey ($1.75) and at the national level ($1.91) were unchanged.  Today, nine states and Washington have an average gas price of $2 or more, unchanged from yesterday, the auto club said.  Philadelphia's average for diesel also went up, picking up 2 cents more a gallon overnight to stand today at $2.47. South Jersey's average ($2.06) and the national average ($2.13) were unchanged.  Meanwhile, oil prices edged up to almost $48 a barrel amid growing confidence that OPEC's decision to ensure that members comply with production quotas will support the market for crude.   Still, persistent concerns over the global financial crisis were expected to exert moderate downward pressure on prices in the coming weeks.   Benchmark crude for April delivery gained 26 cents to $47.61 a barrel by noon in Europe on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices fell as low as $43.62 a barrel Monday but rebounded to close up $1.10 at $47.35. 'At the moment, it's a holding pattern. There is no major news that justify movement in the price. The international economic environment remains very weak,' said David Moore, commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.
