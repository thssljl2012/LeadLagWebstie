The Australian share market closed steady after being dragged back from early highs by resource stocks including Rio Tinto as political opposition intensified over the planned $US19.5 billion investment by China's state-owned Chinalco.  At 1615 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 was down 5.6 points, or 0.16 per cent, at 3446.3, while the broader All Ordinaries declined 7.2 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 3386.2.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange the March share price index contract was 29 points lower at 3450 on a volume of 89,254 contracts. 'We were let down by resources and particularly Rio,' Patersons Securities senior private client adviser Marcus Padley said. 'There's an expectation that the Chinalco deal is in danger. 'It looks like they might have to rejig the deal and include a capital raising.' Rio slumped $4.51, or 8.67 per cent, to $47.50 while rival BHP Billiton, the biggest stock on the market, lost 82 cents, or 2.54 per cent, to $31.08.  The Chinalco deal is facing a mounting political backlash that has led to independent senator Nick Xenophon on Wednesday joining National senate leader Barnaby Joyce in expressing concerns about the move.  In a deparate development, Rio appointed non-executive director and British American Tobacco chairman Jan du Plessis as the global miner's new chairman, replacing incumbent Paul Skinner in April.  Iron ore miner Fortescue Metals also fell, losing 15 cents, or 6.2 per cent, to $2.27.

The local equities market had gained as much as one per cent after a positive lead from Wall Street where an upbeat report on US home construction, pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average 2.48 per cent higher to close at 7,395.70.  That flow-through of positive sentiment helped most financial stocks, including the big four Australian banks. 'The top performing stocks have been financials,' Mr Padley said. 'There's been a dissipation of the fear factor.' National Australia Bank added 26 cents to $19.19, Commonwealth Bank put on 23 cents to $32.70 and Westpac rose three cents to $17.74.
