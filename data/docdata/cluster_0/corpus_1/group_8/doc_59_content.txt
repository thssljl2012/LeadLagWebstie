The Australian share market has barely reacted to the rise in the unemployment rate, with shares still relatively flat.  ABS jobs figures show unemployment jumped from 4.8 per cent to a four-year high of 5.2 per cent in February.  About 1:00pm (AEDT) the All Ordinaries Index was flat at 3,244. The ASX 200 was two points lower at 3,241.  National Australia Bank shares were 2.5 per cent higher after announcing it will cut its first-half dividend to shore up its capital base.  The other three big banks are all lower.  Fortescue Metals has fallen 2 per cent. Newcrest Mining was up almost 3 per cent, after a rally in the gold price.  The Australian dollar was buying 64.92 US cents.
