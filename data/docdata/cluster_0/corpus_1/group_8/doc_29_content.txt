The lead from the US was neutral but there was a lot of negative sentiment, MS Global head of CFDs Anthony Anderson said.  What was positive was that BHP and Rio had a positive run both in London and the US and commodity prices were okay.  China also reaffirmed its eight per cent growth and thats made people more comfortable with the miners.  On the other hand the banks were a little disappointing.
