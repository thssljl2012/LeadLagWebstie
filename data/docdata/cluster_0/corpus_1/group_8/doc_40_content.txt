Oil rose over 2 percent to near $47 a barrel on Monday, extending the previous session's gains of over 4 percent, thanks to a weaker US dollar and optimism that Opec would cut output again at this month's meeting.  US crude for April delivery rose $1.21 to $46.73 a barrel at 0010 GMT, adding to Friday's gains of $1.91.  London Brent crude rose 58 cents $45.43 a barrel. It was the first time since December 11, 2008 that Nymex crude has gained a premium over Brent at the settlement. 'The US dollar has moved lower a little bit this morning and we are getting closer to the Opec meeting on March 15, so I guess those factors are offering support,' said David Moore, an analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  The dollar slid lower versus the euro on Monday, adding to the last session's decline, as investors locked in gains and pared back safe-haven trades on the greenback.   Further encouraging oil's gains were comments from Opec's secretary general, who said on Friday that low oil prices could provide economic stimulus in the short term, but at the cost of a supply shortfall in future due to low investment. - Reuters
