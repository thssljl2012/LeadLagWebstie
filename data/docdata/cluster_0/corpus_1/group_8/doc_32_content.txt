LONDON (SHARECAST) - Financials rallied again as the US markets opened higher, easing some of the pressure on life groups and boosting hedge fund Man.   Man, Prudential and Legal &amp; General are three of the best performers, while Barclays is also higher for a second day on reports it does not need any additional capital.   Oil groups are mixed. US bank Citigroup has cut its price forecasts for Brent crude for 2009 and 2010, prompting a downgrade in its earnings forecasts for the oil sector. Citi has cut its 2009 Brent Crude forecast from $65 a barrel to $48 and its 2010 forecast from $75 to $55 a barrel. "Cost cyclicality will drive the economic threshold for the next generation of marginal projects lower, and we have moved from $85 to $65 a barrel from 2012," Citi said. "As a result, our earnings forecasts drop by an average 38% this year and 35% next year,' the bank added.   The news unsettled Tullow and Cairn, which were both already slipping on results and a share placing respectively.   Tullow ran into profit taking despite describing 2008 as "its best ever year" and adding it has made a strong start to 2009.   Cairn, meanwhile, raised 116.1m through a placing of 6.54m shares at 17.75 each.
