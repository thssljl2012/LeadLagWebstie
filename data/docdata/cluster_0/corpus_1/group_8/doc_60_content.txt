2357 GMT [Dow Jones] S&amp;P/ASX 200 down 1.4% at 3174.5, hit 3162.6 in early trading after Wall Street fell despite expected gains; 3153.0 chart level is holding because of continued bargain-hunting in some beaten-down cyclicals like Macquarie Group, Brambles, Fortescue, Bluescope, OneSteel. IAG up 1.9% despite going ex-div. 'I think there is an appetite to buy some stocks that have been beaten up,' says UBS head of sales George Kanaan. 'I think the Australian equity market is in far better shape than the rest of the world.' Kanaan expects market to stay above yesterday's low of 3153 in quiet trading, but doesn't think index can manage positive close because of weakness in heavyweight stocks like CBA and Rio Tinto. Doesn't see 4Q GDP data due 0130 GMT as much of a swing factor for equities today. BHP Billiton down 1.4% at A$26.90, well below A$27.50 ADR equivalent.
