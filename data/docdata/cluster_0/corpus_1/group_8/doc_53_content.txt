North American stocks were mixed at mid-morning Friday as an early rally  fuelled by higher commodity prices and bargain hunting following the previous day's sell-off  ran out of steam after a brokerage house cut its outlook for Apple Inc. profit.  Photograph by: CNS, Canwest News Service  The Toronto Stock Exchange spent much of Friday in positive territory but succumbed in the afternoon to relentless signs of an international economic downturn that's reluctant to go away.  After being up almost 1.8 per cent at one point, the S&amp;P/TSX composite index closed down 37.7 points, or 0.49 per cent, at 7,591.47. It was the fifth loss in six trading days. It finished the week with a decline of 6.54 per cent.  It did manage on Friday to rise sharply near closing time to come in just short of even for the day. Materials, financials and technology stocks led TSX declines, while energy stocks rallied on higher oil prices.  Among the external news affecting investors' moods was the U.S. unemployment rate rising to a 25-year high of 8.1 per cent, U.S. bank Wells Fargo &amp; Co. slashing its dividend, and JPMorgan Chase and Co. cutting its sales outlook for Apple Inc.  Closer to home, Sun Life Financial Co.'s credit rating was cut by Standard &amp; Poor's.  On the commodities market, the price of crude oil rose $1.91 to $45.52 U.S. a barrel in New York, and gold here rose $14.90 to $942.70 U.S. an ounce.  The Canadian dollar rose 11 basis points to 77.73 cents U.S..  In the U.S., the Dow Jones industrial average spent most of the day in negative territory but surged in the final minutes of trading to close up 32.5 points, or 0.49 per cent, at 6,626.94. The Nasdaq composite index was off by 5.74 points, or 0.44 per cent, to 1,293.85 by the end of the day.  The main markets in Europe and Asia were mostly down Friday, ranging from the U.K.'s FTSE finishing slightly better than flat to Japan's Nikkei losing 3.5 per cent.
