TORONTO - Commodity stocks took the Toronto stock market higher mid-morning Friday. New York markets lost a good deal of early momentum amid dismal U.S. employment data for February and revisions to the previous two months showing even greater job losses. Toronto's S&amp;P/TSX composite index moved up 63.6 points to 7,692.8 as the U.S. Labour Department said the economy shed 651,000 jobs last month - just slightly above expectations - while the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 8.1 per cent from 7.6 per cent in January. The Dow Jones industrials gained 26 points to 6,620.5 as revised data show U.S. job losses in December totalled 681,000, against the original 577,000 figure, while 655,000 jobs were lost in January, not the 598,000 originally reported. Many market participants, however, had braced for even grimmer data, shorting stocks earlier in the week. To short a stock means to bet it will fall. The market had 'anticipated bad news, and we got it,' said Rob Lutts, president of Cabot Money Management in New York. But 'my sense is, we haven't discounted all the negatives out there as of yet.' The Canadian dollar is up a fifth of a cent US to 77.82 cents US. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 6.81 points to 1,292.78 while the S&amp;P 500 index moved ahead 3.45 points to 686. The mixed showing came at the end of a terrible week that saw indexes break through recent lows hit last November on growing pessimism about economic conditions, leaving the Dow industrials at 1997 levels and the TSX at 2003 lows. Many analysts believe there is little keeping stocks from falling even further as worries about the automotive and financial sectors continue to weigh on investors. The TSX energy sector was the leading group, up three per cent as the April crude contract in New York rose $1.08 to US$46.69 a barrel. Suncor Inc. (TSX:SU) rose $1.46 to $27.66 and Canadian Natural Resources (TSX:CNQ) gained $2.51 to $43.02. The base metals sector rose two per cent. Teck Cominco Ltd. (TSX:TCK.B) improved 36 cents to $3.78.

Revenues were negative $7.1 million compared to $81.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of plunging copper prices which led to negative price adjustments. The gold sector rose one per cent as the April bullion contract in New York moved up $7.60 to US$935.40 an ounce. Goldcorp Inc. (TSX:G) advanced 68 cents to $39.13.
