Wall Street has ended slightly higher for the second straight day, but the market has not significantly extended yesterday's gains of almost 6 per cent, which were driven by a better outlook from the troubled US bank Citigroup.  Trading has been fairly volatile overnight, with some bad economic news affecting the market.  A plunge in China's February exports has weighed on commodities, and a fall in the price of crude oil weighed on the market early in the session.  But stocks moved higher in the last half-hour, after the chief executive of JP Morgan, Jamie Dimon, said the bank made a profit in the first two months of this year.  Apple has also made gains, after unveiling a new product.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 3 points, to 6,930.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index finished 13 points higher at 1,371.  Meanwhile, a three-day run of gains in Britain has come to an end, with the weakness in banks and British American Tobacco overshadowing a rise in mining shares.  Banks were unable to build on the strong gains in yesterday's session, as concerns about their future returned.  HSBC fell 6 per cent because of an investor sell-off, ahead of the bank's $27 billion rights issue.  Lloyds Banking Group slumped more than 12 per cent.  British American Tobacco lost 6 per cent after going ex-dividend.  Oil producers also retreated, but miners, including BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata made gains.  At the close, London's FT 100 Index was down 21 points to 3,693.  In local futures trade, the Share Price Index 200 has closed 21 points higher to 3,250.  The Australian dollar was up three-quarters of a cent from yesterday's close and about 7:20am AEDT was buying 65.08 US cents.  On the cross-rates, it was at 0.5066 euros; 63.27 Japanese yen; 46.87 pence Sterling; and against the New Zealand dollar it was at 1.271.  Spot gold was higher at $US906.95 an ounce, while West Texas Crude has fallen more than $US3 to $US42.46 a barrel.
