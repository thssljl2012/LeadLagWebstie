Austock Securities senior client adviser Michael Heffernan said early gains from the big miners were driving the bourse at the open, while investors responded positively to National Australia Bank's strategic review. 'The miners are really driving the market, with Rio and BHP both up close to two per cent as the gates were flung open,' Mr Heffernan told AAP. 'The other big mover is National Australia Bank, which is the biggest mover in the top 20 ... It is up four per cent after its strategy review this morning, which clearly, according to the market, has gone down particularly well with investors so far today.'
