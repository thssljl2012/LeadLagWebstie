TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto's main stock index was 4 percent higher late in the session on Tuesday, led by a surge in the heavily weighted financials after a memo to staff by Citigroup's chief executive provided reassurance on the struggling U.S. bank's prospects.  At 3:13 p.m., the S&amp;P/TSX composite index  was up 302.44 points, or 4 percent, at 7,869.38. Nine of its 10 sectors were higher, led by a 11.6 percent surge in the financials index.
