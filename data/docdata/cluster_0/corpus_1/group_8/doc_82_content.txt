TOKYO: Japan's Nikkei average jumped 4 per cent on Wednesday, bouncing back from a 26-year closing low as financial shares climbed after Citigroup's chief executive said the US bank was making profits.  Toshiba Corp shot up more than 8 per cent after a newspaper reported it may see an operating profit of about 100 billion yen ($1 billion) in the next business year, compared with the consensus estimate for a 103 billion yen loss.  'Investors have been overly risk-averse and tried to shrink their positions both in Japan and the United States, but this attitude may ease a bit after bank shares which have been weak for so long pushed up Wall Street,' said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.  US stocks posted their best day in four months on Tuesday after Citigroup Chief Executive Vikram Pandit said the company was profitable in the first two months of 2009 and voiced confidence about its capital strength, easing concerns about the bank's survival prospects.  'But the real economy hasn't improved and sentiment remains the same. We'll just need to see if the rally will end today or continue tomorrow and beyond,' Akino said.  In moderate trade, the benchmark Nikkei gained 283.18 points to 7,338.16, after posting on Tuesday its lowest close since October 1982.  The broader Topix climbed 3.1 per cent to 725.58. It hit a fresh 25-year closing low on Tuesday.  'We may be bracing for a rebound in the short-term as downward revisions of earnings by companies also seem to have calmed down recently,' said Yukio Takahashi, a market analyst at Shinko Securities.  'At least, fears about how far low the market could fall have receded.'  The market mostly shrugged off data showing Japan's core private-sector machinery orders fell 3.2 per cent in January from the previous month, slightly better than a median market forecast for a 4.5 per cent fall.
