At 1200 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 0.2 points, or 0.01 per cent, at 3,154.7, while the broader All Ordinaries index lost 4.7 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 3,117.0.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was seven points, or 0.22 per cent, higher at 3,156 on a volume of 10,560 contracts.  Trading volumes were 'unbelievably poor' with only $1 billion in turnover by noon, Burrell Stockbroking associate Peter Wright said. 'I've seen $1 billion (in turnover) done by 1010 AEDT,' Mr Wright said. 'Everyone is sitting on the sidelines, and anyone who wants to sell has sold.' Uncertainty continues to plague financial stocks, he said.  Australia's major lenders were mostly stronger, with Commonwealth Bank gaining 93 cents, or 3.49 per cent, to $27.57, ANZ Banking Group adding 17 cents, or 1.36 per cent, to $12.70 and Westpac putting on 27 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to $16.17. QBE Insurance added 50 cents, or 3.21 per cent, to $16.10 on profit taking and short covering, Mr Burrell said.  Investors were using derivatives and other avenues to bypass the ban on shorting financial stocks, he said.  Base metals are now trading between 25 per cent and 30 per cent above their December lows leading to some traction in the resources sector, Mr Wright said.  Rio Tinto's volume was very low, he said.  By 1213 AEDT, Rio Tinto gained 20 cents, or 0.42 per cent, to $47.70, on turnover of only 1.8 million, while BHP Billiton slipped one cents, or 0.03 per cent, to $29.11.  Oil stocks were higher, with Oil Search adding 11 cents, or 2.28 per cent, to $4.94, Santos climbing 32 cents, or 2.04 per cent, to $16.04, and Woodside Petroleum up 79 cents, or 2.2 per cent, to $36.70.  But the gold sector lost ground as the gold price retreated.  Lihir Gold fell 11 cents, or 3.49 per cent, to $3.04, Newcrest Mining dropped 90 cents, or 2.87 per cent, to $30.50, and Newmont Mining lost 13 cents, or 2.17 per cent, to $5.86.
