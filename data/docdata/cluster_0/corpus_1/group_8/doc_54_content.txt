(RTTNews) - Wednesday, the major markets across Asia-Pacific region advanced on hopes that the banking sector across the world will recover earlier than expected after the Citibank CEO Vikram Pandit said on Tuesday that the bank made profit in the first two months of 2009, and is poised to report better results for the first quarter. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's assertion that large banks would not be allowed to fail also lifted the sentiment.  On Wall Street, the Dow closed up 379 points or 5.80% at 6,926, the Nasdaq gained 90 points or 7.07% to 1,358, and the S&amp;P 500 added 43 points or 6.37% to finish at 720.  In the Asian session Wednesday, crude was up modestly in electronic trading. Oil closed Tuesday's session down $1.36 at $45.71 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after hitting an intra-day low of $45.33 and a high of $48.32 after U.S. Energy Information Administration or EIA, in its short term outlook, lowered forecast for global energy demand for 2009 by 430,000 barrels to 84.27 million barrels per day.   Banking stocks led the gains across the markets. Mining stocks also advanced after the commodity prices rose in the London Metal Exchange. While copper prices rose 3%, nickel and zinc prices advanced 3.3% and 2.7% respectively. The positive sentiment in the market lifted almost all the stocks, which were in an oversold state following huge sell-offs in the recent past. However, the strength of the rally may not sustain long as a recovery and bottom is nowhere in sight.   Mixed economic data from China also raised fresh concerns. While Fixed Asset Investment rose sharply, aided partially by the stimulus plans, export from the country declined sharply by more than 25% during February following an 18% drop in January, raising doubts whether the growth story of the Chinese economy will fizzle out or could not be sustainable. The Chinese Shanghai composite index discounted the weak economic data and closed in negative, bucking the uptrend in the rest of the major markets in the region.   The markets in India were shut for a public holiday.   In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 Index surged up 321 points or 4.6%, to close at 7,376 in Tokyo, while the broader Topix index added 19 points, or 2.7%, to 722.  On the economic front, the Bank of Japan said on Wednesday that Japan's domestic corporate goods price index was down 0.4% in February compared to the previous month, posting an index score of 105.0. That was better than analyst expectations that had called for a 0.6% fall on month after the 1.0% decline in January. On an annual basis, the CGPI eased 1.1% - slightly better than forecasts that had predicted a decline of 1.2% after the 0.2% fall in the previous month.
