(Adds information, quotes, updates/adds market levels) SINGAPORE (MarketWatch) -- Asian share markets were solidly higher Wednesday after a rally on Wall Street, with sentiment improving further for beaten-down financial stocks. 'Today sentiment is likely to be very bullish,' said KGI Securities trader Randy Chang in Taipei. Japan's Nikkei 225 was the best performer, after declines in the earlier part of the week, rising 3.4%. South Korea's Kospi Composite was 2.7% higher with Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 up 1.9% and New Zealand's NZX-50 up 1.6%. The gains came after Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 5.8% in its biggest point and percentage gain since late November, led by a rally in financial stocks. Still, many traders were skeptical of the durability of the move, as financial and global economic headwinds remained. So far Asian markets weren't matching Wall Street's gain, and U.S. stock futures were flat in screen trade. Indeed, International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn reminded markets Tuesday of the ongoing risks, saying 2009 would be a very difficult year and warning 'we are in a great recession.' 'It's encouraging that the market can have a relief rally,' said GSJBW senior sales trader Patrick Crabb. 'But I think before you can get significant asset allocation changes, the market needs to consolidate. The long-only community would like to see some sort of a base form before they take big bets.' Among financial stocks in Asia, ANZ Bank was up 2.0% with Commonwealth Bank of Australia up 3.9% and Macquarie 4.3% higher. Japan's Mizuho FG added 7.2% with Sumitomo Mitsui FG up 5.2% and insurer Tokio Marine up 6.3%, while Korea's KB Financial gained 6.2%. There was some fallout in the real estate sector in Tokyo after Pacific Holdings said it had filed for court-led rehabilitation with liabilities totaling Y163.65 billion due to fund-raising problems. Nippon Residential Investment was ask-only with the company managed by Pacific Residential, whose major shareholder is Pacific Holdings. Australian commodity stocks rose with BHP Billiton up 5.2%, Fortescue adding 4.6% and Rio Tinto 3.8% higher, though gold miners were hit by Tuesday's decline in the price of gold, with Newcrest down 3.3% and Lihir off 5.3%. New Zealand shares were led by stocks hurt last month by balance sheet worries, with Fisher &amp; Paykel Appliances up 5.9% and Nuplex up 4.9%, while bellwether Telecom gained 3.0%. A fall in the U.S. dollar against the won helped some Korean stocks as it would make repayment of dollar-denominated debt easier, with Posco up 4.0%, Korean Air up 3.4% and Hyundai Heavy up 4.6%. The dollar fell against the won to KRW1,482, from KRW1,511.5 Tuesday. Elsewhere in currency markets the euro continued to gain against the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen, to reflect better appetite for risk. The single currency was at $1.2721, up from $1.2657 late in New York, and at Y125.49, from Y124.94. The U.S. dollar was around Y98.65, from Y98.74. Risker currencies like the Australian dollar were buoyed with the currency recently around US$0.6488. The U.S. dollar fell to around S$1.5332 from S$1.5380 against the Singapore dollar, and dropped to MYR3.6800 from MYR3.6900 against the ringgit, after the Malaysian government Tuesday unveiled a second, large-size economic stimulus package. Rising stocks pushed bonds down with lead Japanese government bond futures slipping 0.12 to 138.48 points. April Nymex crude oil futures were up 25 cents at $45.97 a barrel on Globex, after a $1.36 fall in New York which came on demand worries.
