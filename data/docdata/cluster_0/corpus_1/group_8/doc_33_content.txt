(RTTNews) - Wednesday morning in Asia, the South Korean won strengthened to new multi-week highs against its US and Japanese counterparts as a rally in global stock markets revived demand for emerging-market assets.  The market in Seoul opened higher today, taking cues from the U.S market, where the indices ended sharply higher following positive news from the Citibank and bargain hunting by investors at lower levels.  The benchmark KOSPI Index opened at 1,120.96 compared to its previous close of 1,092.20, and continues to trade in the green. Almost all the stocks are trading higher as investors picked stocks at lower prices. The index is presently up 2.60% at 1,120.57.  The market received further support from an announcement by the finance ministry officials that the Government is planning to take positive steps to remove unnecessary administrative regulations, especially in the service sector, to increase jobs and fuel economic growth.  The South Korean won jumped to near a 3-week high of 1466.10 against the US dollar in early Asian deals on Wednesday. On the upside, 1450 is seen as the next target level for the Korean currency. The dollar-won pair was worth 1501.40 at yesterday's close.  In early Asian deals on Wednesday, the South Korean won rose to 14.9065 against the Japanese yen. This set the highest point for the won since February 09. If the Korean currency gains further, it may likely target the 14.84 level. At yesterday's close, the yen-won pair was quoted at 15.2215.  The Bank of Japan said today that Japan's domestic corporate goods price index was down 0.4% in February compared to the previous month, posting an index score of 105.0. That was better than analyst expectations that had called for a 0.6% fall on month after the 1.0% decline in January. On an annual basis, CGPI eased 1.1% - slightly better than forecasts that had predicted a decline of 1.2% after the 0.2% fall in the previous month.  Meanwhile, the Cabinet Office said that core machinery orders in Japan were down 3.2% in January compared to the previous month, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline. That came in higher than analyst expectations for a 4.8% monthly decline following the 1.7% drop in December.  For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com
