A new crisis of confidence has rocked world markets, sending the Footsie plunging to a six-year low and the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its lowest level since 1997.  The FTSE 100 Index plunged more than 5% as a 12.5bn cash call from HSBC sparked a major banking sell-off.  The index fell below the trading low of 3665 seen in October last year to hit levels not seen since April 2003.  In New York, Wall Street closed at its lowest level since October 1997 - with the Dow Jones tumbling 300.11 points (4.25%) to 6,762.82.  The heavy Footsie falls put the top-flight index in sight of the 3287 nadir reached in March 2003.  That date marked the worst depths the market plunged to following the dot.com crash at the turn of the decade.  David Jones, chief market strategist at IG Index, said: 'After the strong recoveries seen at the end of last year, many were starting to hope that the worst of the slides for stock market were behind us. 'Today's move to beneath the previous low raises the real prospect of another significant tumble, with 2003 lows of around 3300 a popular target in the medium term.' The Footsie was driven lower by news of a record 12.5bn rights issue from Europe's biggest bank, HSBC.  The call for funds from one of the world's safest banks - as well as a 62% slide in annual profits - triggered a sell-off across the sector.  HSBC fell 20% - wiping around 12bn off the bank's value - and was followed by double-digit losses for Lloyds Banking Group, which slid 11%.  Barclays fell almost 7% and Royal Bank of Scotland - nearly 70% taxpayer-owned - was 4% lower.  Wall Street fell after a new bail-out was announced for insurance giant AIG.  Figures showed the US economy contracted at its fastest pace for more than a quarter of a century - shrinking by a mammoth 6.2% in the final three months of last year.  All of Asia's markets were lower overnight, with Japan's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng finishing almost 4% lower as fears over the worsening US economy also hit confidence.
