THE Australian stock market was flat at noon after a morning of fluctuation.  At 1200 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 1.8 points, or 0.06 per cent, at 3,246.2 while the broader All Ordinaries index had added 0.4 point, or 0.01 per cent, to 3,199.5.   On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was 17 points higher at 3,246 on a volume of 13,063 contracts.   Bell Potter senior adviser Stuart Smith said the market was fluctuating as investors searched for solid indicators of overall market movement. 'It's been up and down, up and down, a bit like a lollipop lady's stop and go sign,' Mr Smith said. 'But we're positive, at least at the moment. 'I'm warming to being on the bullish side of the market right now.' Investors have welcomed National Australia Bank's strategy update, sending its shares up 54 cents, or 3.31 per cent, to $16.84.   The bank said it would slash its first half dividend by about 25 per cent and seek to boost its Australian business as it eyes potential acquisitions thrown up by the global financial crisis.   But it said there were no immediate plans for acquisitions. 'There's nothing new there. We thought they would talk about their credit default swap exposures and they haven't done that, so I would imagine if there was anything untoward they would have to say it,' Mr Smith said. The other banks were lower, with ANZ down 17 cents at $12.98, Westpac losing 32 cents to $16.55 and Commonwealth Bank falling 25 cents to $28.36.   US stocks ended marginally higher overnight, with profit-taking eating into early gains.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.91 points to 6,930.4.
