At the 4.15pm (AEDT) close, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index had fallen 87.6 points or 2.43 per cent to 3510.4, while the broader All Ordinaries index lost 81.7 points or 2.31 per cent to 3452.5.  CMC Markets senior dealer Matt Lewis said the local bourse followed US markets downwards on the news that a proposed multi-billion-dollar bailout of troubled US car makers may not gain sufficient support.  'Traders continue to remain cautious ahead of any firm outcome in the bailout proposal of the car makers in the US, with overall volumes fairly light coming into the Christmas period,'' Mr Lewis said.  He said some investors were switching their money from the banks into gold stocks which were also benefitting from a strong run in precious metal prices and the weak US dollar.
