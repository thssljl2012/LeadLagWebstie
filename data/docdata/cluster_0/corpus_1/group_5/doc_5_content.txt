The Australian sharemarket was marginally in the red at noon as the mining giants lost ground but retailers and brewers were stronger.  At 1203 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 12.9 points, or 0.36 per cent, to 3,544.5, while the broader All Ordinaries index fell 11.9 points, or 0.34 per cent, to 3,480.4.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange at 1204 AEDT, the March share price index contract was 19 points lower at 3,534 on a volume of 6,914 contracts.  CommSec market analyst Steven Daghlian said the market had see-sawed in and out of negative territory in morning trade.  Mr Daghlian said the resources sector was lower after figures from Asia showed that oil and base metal consumption in China, Australia's second largest export market, was slowing down more quickly than expected initially. 'The oil price fell six per cent yesterday, so we're seeing some weakness in energy stocks,' he said. At 1205 AEDT, Woodside was down 19 cents at $32.56, Santos was up 34 cents, or 2.5 per cent, at $13.96 and Oil Search inched three cents higher to $4.03.  Australia's largest energy retailer, AGL Energy, and Sydney Gas both have gone into trading halts pending an announcement about a material transaction, which the latter says is in relation to a takeover bid.  CommSec market analyst Savanth Sebastian said it appeared the announcements were related.  AGL last traded at $15.45 and Sydney Gas at 27.5 cents.  At 1208 AEDT, mining giant BHP Billiton had retreated 68 cents, or 2.29 per cent, to $28.96 while rival Rio Tinto had given up $1.05, or 2.81 per cent, to $36.35.  Mr Daghlian said the retail sector largely was stronger, 'but it is a bit too early to say whether the federal government's economic stimulus payments have boosted last-minute festive trading'. At 1206 AEDT, Coles and Bunnings owner Wesfarmers was down five cents to $16.57, rival Woolworths had gained 13 cents to $26.22, David Jones had added three cents, or 1.03 per cent, to $2.95, and Harvey Norman crept one cent higher to $2.36.  Harvey Norman said on Tuesday that like-for-like written sales for the 28 days to December 21 were 8.7 per cent higher on the corresponding period last year.  Lion Nathan, which seeks to merge with Coca Cola Amatil, added 23 cents, or 3.1 per cent, to $7.64 at 1208 AEDT, while fellow brewer Fosters Group gained 24 cents, or 4.57 per cent, to $5.49.  The banks were mixed at 1210 AEDT. Commonwealth Bank was up 34 cents, or 1.26 per cent, to $27.40, National Australia Bank advanced 13 cents to $19.74, ANZ shed 17 cents, or 1.14 per cent, to $14.69 and Westpac dipped 39 cents, or 2.32 per cent, to $16.39.  Shares in Bendigo and Adelaide Bank fell 86 cents, or 7.33 per cent, to $10.88 at 1212 AEDT after it said it had raised $175 million via a share purchase plan and an institutional placement.
