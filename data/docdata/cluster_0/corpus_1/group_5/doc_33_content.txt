* World stocks slump then recover on US auto bailout news  * Bonds jump, US dollar falls then recovers  * US auto bailout fails in Senate, revived by White House  NEW YORK, Dec 12 - World stocks fell, bonds rose and the U.S. dollar tumbled on Friday after the U.S. Congress failed late Thursday to pass an automaker bailout package, but the White House's assurance that it would try to prevent the car makers' bankruptcy helped markets to recover some ground.  The collapse of a proposed bailout for U.S. automakers raised fears of a deeper economic slowdown and further financial shocks that may jeopardize worldwide efforts to ease a global recession.[nLC578768]  GM, Ford and Chrysler employ nearly 250,000 people directly and 100,000 more jobs at parts suppliers could hang on their survival.  Shares of General Motors  were down 11 percent to $3.66 while Ford Motor  was off 8 percent to $2.66 after GM fell more than 30 percent and Ford more than 20 percent on opening. 'There will be some type of action to prevent a collapse,' said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York. 'That doesn't mean they don't need to be significantly restructured, which would entail people losing jobs, factories closing, new management in some cases and certainly new oversight.'

The Nasdaq Composite Index  shed 9.02 points, or 0.60 percent, to 1,498.86.

So far this year the benchmark S&amp;amp;P 500 index is down about 40 percent.  Earlier European shares fell led by banks which slipped after U.S. bank JP Morgan  said it had had a 'terrible' November and December, and auto stocks which fell after rescue talks for U.S. carmakers collapsed.  The FTSEurofirst 300  index of top European shares was down 4.8 percent at 812.92 points early in the session.

BONDS SOAR EARLY  U.S. Treasuries prices soared overnight before giving back ground on Friday after new U.S. economic data looked less grim than forecast and the U.S. Treasury said it stood ready to prevent the failure of the car makers, despite the Senate's failure to pass a rescue bill late Thursday. 'Today has been one of those V-shaped days where there was a big rally overnight which then turned tail once investors saw that the government was not going to let General Motors fail and that retail sales were not as bad as expected,' said Cary Leahey, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York. Leahey said 'a significant flight to Treasuries occurred overnight due to nervousness about GM and weak equities. 'Then people took profits after the U.S. retail sales report which showed some steadiness in retail sales,' he said. of 1.9 percent for total sales forecast by Wall Street. Sales of furniture, electronics and clothing rose. 'People are taking some of the money they were spending on energy and spending it on other things which was a more upbeat reading than expected,' Leahey said. In morning trade, benchmark 10-year Treasury notes  were down 7/32, with their yields rising to 2.63 percent from 2.61 percent on Thursday. Two-year Treasury notes  were also flat, yielding 0.80 percent.  Euro zone government bonds turned negative on Friday after an early rally also. March Bund futures  were down 25 ticks on the day at 122.17, well off the session high of 123.43. Two-year Schatz yields  were flat on the day at 2.14 percent percent, having earlier fallen to a low of 2.042 percent.  DOLLAR SLUMPS FURTHER  The U.S. dollar plunged to its lowest in 13-1/2 years against the yen on Friday, as the U.S. Senate's failure to agree on a bail-out for troubled U.S. automakers sharply diminished risk appetite and stoked demand for the low-yielding Japanese currency.  The dollar tumbled to 88.1 yen , according to electronic trading platform EBS, before some recovery on speculation Japanese authorities may consider intervening to stem further yen strength. 'The environment has become challenging for the dollar, with the collapse of the auto deal the big driver overnight,' said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at TD Securities in Toronto. 'So risk appetite has come off and boosted the yen. And perhaps people are looking at the dollar and it's not looking great because of the U.S. economy's low growth and low interest rates. We are perhaps looking at the cusp of a big sell-off in the dollar.' The euro  was little changed at $1.3356, while sterling  traded 0.3 percent lower at $1.4986. U.S. crude oil futures fell sharply Friday as global equities slumped amid the failure of the U.S. automaker rescue package in the U.S. Senate, and with Goldman Sachs predicting oil prices could fall to $30 a barrel.
