TORONTO -- On a day that the Bank of Canada confirmed the 'R' word and drastically cut lending rates, Canadian investors decided it was time to take some profits, sending the country's main benchmark exchange into negative territory Tuesday. The S&amp;amp;P/TSX Composite Index closed down 169.56 points or 1.98% to 8397.56, ending a two-day recovery that saw the Index rise more than 6%. The TSX Venture exchange was down 12.01 points or 1.72% to 686.17.   Early Tuesday, the Bank of Canada drastically cut its benchmark-lending rate by 75 basis points and warned that Canada is headed for recession as global economic conditions deteriorate at a pace quicker than expected. The rate drops to 1.5%, the lowest level since 1958.   Te majority of Canada's top six banks decided not to match the central bank's full rate cut. Instead of passing the full effect of the lower rate on to customers, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Commerce and Bank of Montreal decided to utilize part of the rate cut to shore up their profit margins and cut their prime by 50 basis points. The S&amp;amp;P/TSX Financial subindex fell 5% on the day to 1107.08, while the Canadian dollar dipped to US79.08 cents, down 66 basis points. 'Canada came off a little less than the U.S., so the rate cut probably gave us a bit of a boost,' said Colin Cieszynski, a technical analyst at CMC Markets. 'Especially since commodities were all off on the day.' Energy stocks were virtually flat as crude oil prices fell US$1.64 to US$42.07 a barrel. The Energy Group fell 7.79 points to 2026.47 with Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. falling 3% to $40.90 and Suncor Energy Inc., climbing almost 3% to $23.97 respectively. The Materials subindex was up 1.5% to 1805.42. Copper, which topped US$1.60 on Monday, fell back to near US$1.40 while gold climbed US$4.90 to US$774.20.  Mr. Cieszynski said market sentiment is starting to turn and noted that so far this month, pullbacks in the market following rallies, have been less severe, resulting in higher lows. Still, the technical analyst says a full-fledged bull market is at least a few months away. 'We had a couple of solid up days but we are going to have down days as we work through the bottoming process,' he said. 'Right now, it is a standoff between the bears and bulls and any recoveries in the market that run for a couple days don't get very far because of the ongoing worries about the economy.' In the United States, stocks fell, also on profit taking following a two day rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 242.85 points, or 2.7%, to 8,691.33. The S&amp;amp;P 500 dropped 21.03 points 2.3% to 888.67 and the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 24.40 points or 1.6% to 1,547.34.   FedEx Corp. fell 14% after the country's second largest courier company warned that its earnings will miss analyst estimates.
