Investors are also focused on the automakers since the Bush administration said last week that it might offer General Motors (GM, Fortune 500) and Chrysler bridge loans from the $700 billion bailout fund Congress set aside for Wall Street. However, President Bush declined to give a timeline for any action, when speaking last weekend.'Investors are expecting a rescue package to be announced, and most of that is baked into the market already,' Dickson said. But he said a bigger problem is what's going to happen to GM's finance arm, GMAC, if it fails to come up with the capital it needs to become a bank holding company. Such a step is necessary for the troubled GMAC to access federal money.Dickson said that worries about the automakers and GMAC have added an additional element of risk to the markets, making investors more cautious than they might otherwise be right now.
