The Australian sharemarket was marginally in the red this afternoon as mining giants lost ground but retailers and brewers were stronger.  The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 12.9 points, or 0.36%, to 3,544.5, while the broader All Ordinaries index fell 11.9 points, or 0.34%, to 3,480.4.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index contract was 19 points lower at 3,534 on a volume of 6,914 contracts.  CommSec market analyst Steven Daghlian said the market had see-sawed in and out of negative territory in morning trade.  Mr Daghlian said the resources sector was lower after figures from Asia showed that oil and base metal consumption in China, Australia's second largest export market, was slowing down more quickly than expected initially.  'The oil price fell 6% yesterday, so we're seeing some weakness in energy stocks,'' he said.  Woodside was down 19 cents at $32.56, Santos was up 34 cents, or 2.5%, at $13.96 and Oil Search inched three cents higher to $4.03.  Australia's largest energy retailer, AGL Energy, and Sydney Gas both have gone into trading halts pending an announcement about a material transaction, which the latter says is in relation to a takeover bid.  CommSec market analyst Savanth Sebastian said it appeared the announcements were related.  AGL last traded at $15.45 and Sydney Gas at 27.5 cents.  Mining giant BHP Billiton has retreated 68 cents, or 2.29%, to $28.96 while rival Rio Tinto had given up $1.05, or 2.81%, to $36.35.  Mr Daghlian said the retail sector largely was stronger, 'but it is a bit too early to say whether the federal government's economic stimulus payments have boosted last-minute festive trading''.  Coles and Bunnings owner Wesfarmers was down five cents to $16.57, rival Woolworths had gained 13 cents to $26.22, David Jones had added three cents, or 1.03%, to $2.95, and Harvey Norman crept one cent higher to $2.36.
