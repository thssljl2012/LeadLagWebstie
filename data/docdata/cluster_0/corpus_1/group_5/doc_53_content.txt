The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a higher opening on Wednesday. Trading activity is likely to be light because of the abbreviated trading session and the upcoming holiday on account of Christmas. Traders would be digesting mixed batch economic news, which highlighted the weakness in the job market, while also showing a less severe setback in consumer spending. However, crude oil prices are moving lower, which could exert downward pressure on the oil space.   Although the U.S. stocks held ground till late morning trading, they receded thereafter, as investors weighed negative housing market data and its impact on the economy. Additionally, weaker commodity prices also impacted sentiment. The Dow Industrials ended the session down 100.28 points or 1.18% at 8,419. While the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index slipped 8.47 points or 0.97% to 863, the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 10.81 points or 0.71% to 1,522.  Twenty-five of the Dow components ended the session lower. General Motors (GM) (down 14.77%), Bank of America (BAC) (down 5.76%) and Citigroup (C) (down 3.41%) were among the worst decliners in the session. On the other hand, Alcoa (AA), General Electric (GE) and Merck (MRK) showed some degree of buying interest.  Among the sector indexes, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell 2.80% and the Amex Disk Drive Index receded 1.92%. The Philadelphia Oil Service Index and the Amex Oil Index moved down 1.22% and 0.72%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Utilities Average declined closed to 2%. While the KBW Bank Index slid 2%, the Amex Securities Broker Dealer Index was down 1.89%. The Philadelphia Housing Sector slipped 2.09% and the S&amp;amp;P Retail Index fell 1.39%. However, the Amex Gold Bugs Index rallied 2.97%.  Although the Nasdaq Composite has violated a short-term downtrend, it is still within a primary downtrend that has been in place since late 2007. The index is now challenging its 50-day moving average, which is currently at 1,570. The index is likely to hold the 1,399-1,587 trading range through the end of the year, barring the occurrence of any adverse development. Immediate support for the index is around 1,480
