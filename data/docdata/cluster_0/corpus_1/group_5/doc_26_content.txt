* Nikkei rises 0.5 pct, extending Monday's over 5 pct gain  * Exporters, machinery makers gain on US stimulus plans  * Nintendo climbs on strong Wii sales (Adds stocks, details)  TOKYO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - The Nikkei average rose 0.5 percent on Tuesday, buoyed by exporters such as Honda Motor Co  on optimism for U.S. economic plans and a government bailout of the 'Big Three' automakers.  Komatsu , the world's second-largest maker of earth-moving equipment, and other construction machinery shares extended Monday's gains on hopes for U.S. President-elect Barack Obama's infrastructure spending plan.  'Expectations for Obama's administration were reflected positively also in the Japanese market,' said Fumiyuki Nakanishi, manager at SMBC Friend Securities.  'But the Nikkei average was pushed back when it neared 8,500 ahead of the settlement of Nikkei futures and options contracts later this week.'  The benchmark Nikkei  added 40.38 points to end the morning at 8,369.43, after rising as much as 2 percent earlier. It shot up over 5 percent the previous day.  The broader Topix  gained 0.7 percent to 817.88.  The closely watched settlement price, known in Japan as the special quotation or 'SQ,' is calculated from the opening prices of the 225 shares in the Nikkei average on the second Friday of the month.  Kazuhiro Takahashi, general manager at Daiwa Securities SMBC, said data showing Japan's economy shrank more than initially estimated in the third quarter also helped put a brake on further gains in the market, coupled with uncertainty over Obama's plans. [ID:nT280072]  'Still, there's a sense of relief because the Big Three automakers will likely manage to survive. If they were to fail, that would have led to a further deterioration in the economy,' he said.  'On the whole, we have optimism for now.'  U.S. stocks rallied to their highest level in a month on Monday on optimism that Obama's proposed infrastructure spending could limit the depth of the recession and on hopes for the bailout of the three automakers -- GM , Ford and Chrysler . [ID:nN05458678]  Obama has started by asking his economic team to come up with a plan to create at least 2.5 million new jobs by 2011. Congress is also expected to pass a hefty new economic stimulus bill in January that could be ready for Obama's signature immediately after he is sworn in.  Meanwhile, the White House reviewed a Democratic plan on Monday to bail out stricken automakers with up to $15 billion in loans, a move that would also clear the way for longer-term help if industry meets certain conditions. [ID:nN07466561]  EXPORTERS LEAD, NINTENDO JUMPS  Shares of Honda jumped 3.4 percent to 1,795 yen and Toyota Motor Corp  added 1.3 percent to 2,765 yen, while Sony Corp  advanced 3.5 percent to 1,889 yen.  Komatsu climbed 5 percent to 1,057 yen and Kubota  shot up 6.3 percent to 554 yen. Hitachi Construction  jumped 5.7 percent to 1,018 yen.  Construction companies powered gains on Wall Street on Monday, with Caterpillar surging almost 11 percent.  Shares of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group  gained 8.1 percent to 465 yen after Japan's largest bank said its planned capital raising will bring in about $8.6 billion, replenishing funds after losses on its equity portfolio and an investment in Morgan Stanley . [ID:nT322471]  Other notable stocks were Sumco Corp  and Nintendo Co .  Silicon wafer maker Sumco shot up 6.9 percent to 924 yen after the Nikkei business daily said the firm has decided to spend an additional 17 billion yen ($183.2 million) to boost output capacity for solar wafers at a 14.5 billion yen plant under construction in Japan.  Shares of Nintendo jumped 4 percent to 33,650 yen after it said sales of its Wii game console more than doubled during the week of the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States, apparently defying the retail gloom brought about by the global economic crisis. [ID:nT338918]  Trade was active on the Tokyo exchange's first section, with 912 million shares changing hands, compared with last week's morning average of 791 million.
