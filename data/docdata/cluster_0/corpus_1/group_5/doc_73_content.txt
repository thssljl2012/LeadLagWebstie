The Hang Seng Index is set to face selling pressure before Christmas, and mainboard turnover is expected to drop as the holiday mood takes hold.  'Investors tend to take profit and get cash for Christmas gifts,' said First Shanghai Securities strategist Linus Yip Sheung-chi.  He said HSBC Holdings (0005) may drag the index down by 80 to 100 points.  On Friday the bank's American depository receipts listed in the United States fell about 8 percent to HK$70.60.  Selling pressure is considerable as HSBC's outlook was revised to negative from stable by Standard and Poor's last Friday. And according to Yip, HSBC's price-to- book value ratio is relatively high when compared with other international lenders like Citibank.  Yip also says investors could sell on good news. The Hang Seng Index has support at 14,500 after Beijing announced 14 measures last week to support the Hong Kong economy.  The US bailout package for US automakers General Motors and Chrysler will also cheer investors.  Some retail stocks rallied on Friday. Lifestyle International (1212) jumped 11.4 percent while Giordano (0709) was up 9.8 percent.  Yip expects the HSI rebound, which began in late November, to end soon as it has not reacted appreciably to support measures.  The HSI closed at 15,127.5 on Friday, up 21 percent from 12,457.9 on November 24.  Delta Asia Financial head of equity markets Conita Hung Lai- ping expects any impact caused by the weakness of HSBC shares to be offset by SAR-listed China stocks, which will find support on the strong mainland market. She expects the benchmark to move between 14,500 and 15,500 this week.  Although the lock-up period of many mainland stocks will expire this week, Hung said it is not a worry for the market unless there is a significant rebound. 'I think people will not choose to dump shares at a low price now' she said.
