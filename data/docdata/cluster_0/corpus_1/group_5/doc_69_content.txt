TORONTO  The Toronto stock market staged a late recovery to close higher as financials largely turned positive amid pessimism about the economy and lower commodity prices.  Torontos S&amp;amp;P/TSX composite index rose 59.21 points to 8,117.03 with losses led by energy stocks, as investors also took in grim Canadian data.  Despite the late day rally, it was still a brutal week on the TSX, which tumbled 12.4 per cent thanks to big declines in all the major sectors of the market.  New Yorks Dow Jones industrial average closed up 259.18 points to 8,635.42 after the U.S. Labour Department tallied American job losses in November at 533,000, far more than the 320,000 economists had expected.  The U.S. jobless rate increased two-tenths of a percentage point to 6.7 per cent.  In Canada, Statistics Canada reported the economy shed 70,600 jobs last month, the biggest one-month drop since 1982, and the unemployment rate rose to 6.3 per cent.  And analysts warned investors to expect more awful data.  'Were going to be looking at fourth quarter U.S. GDP numbers and first quarter GDP numbers that will show very significant declines, probably five per cent plus on an annualized basis,' said John Johnston, chief strategist, the Harbour Group at RBC Dominion Securities.  'Weve had recessions lite in the U.S. for the last couple of rounds  this is a regular recession.'

New Yorks Nasdaq composite index was ahead 63.75 points to 1,509.31 while the S&amp;amp;P 500 edged up 30.85 points to 876.07.  A turnaround in financials  especially insurance companies  was primarily responsible for the sharp narrowing of losses in New York after Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. said its capital position is strong and hiked its earnings forecast for the year. Its shares surged $7.38 or 102.36 per cent to US$14.59.  The Toronto financial sector also got a boost from the news, ending the day up 2.6 per cent after Royal Bank reported a 15 per cent decline in quarterly profit to $1.12 billion, as revenue sagged 10 per cent to $5.07 billion.
