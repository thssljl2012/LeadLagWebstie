Wall Street fell overnight as poor company outlooks had investors worried about the difficulty of an economic turnaround.   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 242.85, or 2.72 percent, to 8,691.33, while the broader Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 index fell 21.03, or 2.31 percent, to 888.67.   The Nasdaq composite index fell 24.40, or 1.55 percent, to 1,547.34.  CMC Markets analyst David Taylor said the fall in the Westpac's share price after its resumption was in line with expectations, given the difficulties in the financial sector in the current environment. 'Westpac's share price has obviously been hit hard after its raising yesterday, and the financial sector is leading the market down so far,' Mr Taylor said. After ignoring the downwards trend of Wall Street earlier this week, the local market was today feeding off the weaker sentiment in the US, he said. 'Our market is all over the place at the moment,' Mr Taylor said. 'The futures are pointing to a loss of about 10 points at the moment, and I wouldn't expect the market to move too much from where it is at the moment.'
