Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  STOCKS dipped into the red to close around 0.7 per cent lower, led down by weaker mining stocks.  At 4.15pm (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 26 points, or 0.73 per cent, to 3531.4, while the broader All Ordinaries index fell 24.1 points, or 0.69 per cent, to 3468.2.  'There was a fall off the cliff around 1.00pm - a lot of people went out to lunch - and then we zig-zagged and finished up off the lows,'' Austock Securities senior client adviser Michael Heffernan said.  'But it was BHP Billiton and Rio that came in for a belting of the major stocks,'' he said.  Rio Tinto said it had suspended its iron ore production at one of their mines in Western Australia.  The big miners were both hurting at the close, dragging the market into negative territory.  Rio's share price closed $2.03 lower at $35.37, while BHP lost 3.88 per cent to $28.49 despite higher metals prices in London overnight.  Metals were broadly higher thanks to a weaker US dollar and rising Chinese imports, IG Markets' research analyst Ben Potter said.  'However, gains are expected to be limited with underlying demand concerns likely to cap significant rises,'' he said.  China's central bank announced a cut of 0.27 percentage points in its benchmark one-year rate, which disappointed Asian markets today, Mr Potter said.  'Many participants had been looking for a larger cut, some as much as double the 27 basis points received.''  Australia's largest energy retailer, AGL Energy, and Sydney Gas remained in trading halts pending an announcement about a material transaction, which the latter says is in relation to a takeover bid.  AGL last traded at $15.45 and Sydney Gas last traded at 27.5 cents before their trading was halted.  Financials slumped with the exception of ANZ Banking Group, which gained 1 cent to $14.87.  'The banks have held up well today,'' Mr Heffernan said.  Westpac was the worst performer losing 3.1 per cent, to $16.26, while NAB gave up 1 cent to $19.60.  Commonwealth Bank softened 2 cents to $27.04.  Shares in Bendigo and Adelaide Bank closed down 5.37 per cent, to $11.11 after it said it had raised $175 million via a share purchase plan and an institutional placement.  Diversified financials fared better than the banking sector, with wealth managers AXA Asia Pacific Holdings adding 9 cents to $4.36 by 4.36pm and AMP firming 3 cents to $5.40.  Insurers were mixed, with QBE Insurance Group dropping 58 cents to $24.79 and Insurance Australia Group adding 4 cents to $3.86.  Retailers were mostly down.  David Jones lost 2 cents to $2.90, Woolworths dropped 36 cents to $25.73 and Pacific Brands was down 1 cent to 31 cents.  Oil stocks were mixed with Oil Search gaining 2.5 per cent to $4.10, Santos rising 22 cents to $13.84, and Woodside Petroleum losing 59 cents to $32.16.  In the media sector, Fairfax Media boosted 1 cent to $1.55, while rival News Corporation (the parent company of the publisher of news.com.au) shed 2.3 per cent, to $13.15.  Gold stocks were mostly stronger.  Lihir Gold was up 3 cents to $2.85, while Newcrest Mining advanced $1.02 to $32.42.  By 4.30pm the spot price of gold in Sydney was $US842.75 per fine ounce, down $US1.80 on Monday's close of $US844.55.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index contract was 21 points lower at 3532 on a volume of 15,725 contracts.
