HONG KONG, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares are seen higher on Monday on hopes of further market support measures from central banks across the world and more stimulus measures from China as its fights to protect its growth rate. Oil refiners will be watched after China on Friday unveiled a long-awaited overhaul of its subsidised domestic fuel price regime, a move that should make petrol cheaper in the short term and allow for more predictable profits at its state-owned refiners. 'There will be worries about whether the government will cut its subsidies to these refiners after the fuel price reforms. That should put some pressure on these stocks,' said Ben Kwong, COO with KGI Asia. The Hang Seng Index rose 2.5 percent on Friday but finished the week little changed as higher mortgage rates at local lenders left property counters reeling.
