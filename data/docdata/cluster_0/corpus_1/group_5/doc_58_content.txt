Asian markets dropped Wednesday, with auto and tire makers such as Toyota Motor Corp., Hyundai Motor Co. and Bridgestone Corp. subjected to some harsh treatment after they cut their sales and earnings forecasts earlier in the week.  Hong Kong stocks extended losses as market heavyweight HSBC Holdings fell for a fifth straight session on persistent speculation it may launch a share placement or rights issue to boost capital.  Australian shares, however, advanced after declining for two days.  The broad decline for regional stocks came in the wake of extended losses on Wall Street and weak economic and housing data from the U.S. overnight.  Andrew Sullivan, a sales trader at Main First Securities, said share movements were likely to be amplified because of thin volumes, as several investors and fund managers were going away for the Christmas and New Year holidays.  As the year came to an end, the outlook for January was 'a million-dollar question for most funds because the beginning of [2008] was when a lot of guys made their money,' he said. 'The big question here is how much of the recession is priced in. ... People are still thinking that it's probably a bit too early to get involved in the normal cyclical stocks.'  In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average ended the morning trading session down 2.7% at 8,488.95, while the broader Topix index fell 2.7% to 825.77.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slipped 0.3% to 14,172.27, and China's Shanghai Composite Index dropped 1.2% to 1,874.49, while Singapore's Straits Times Index rose 0.4% to 1,730.72.  Hong Kong and Singaporean markets were open only for a half-day session Wednesday. Most of Asia will be closed Thursday for Christmas, with Tokyo and Shanghai markets being exceptions.  South Korea's Kospi lost 2.5% to 1,116.28.  Australia's S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index rose 0.7% to 3,555.30, and New Zealand's NZX 50 index added 0.4% to 2,672.91.  Taiwan's Taiex fell 0.6% to 4,379.40, while Malaysia's KLSE Composite gave up 0.3% to trade at 868.24.  Regional detail  Toyota (TM) fell 4% in Tokyo after the company said Monday it expects a group operating loss of 150 billion yen ($1.7 billion) for the fiscal year ending March 31, compared to a 2.27 trillion yen profit a year earlier.  The company also cut its net income projection to 50 billion yen, down 91% from its earlier estimate, in addition to lowering its unit-sales target to 7.54 million vehicles from 8.24 million units.  Shares of Bridgestone (BRDCY) tumbled 5.2% after the tire maker cut its net income forecast for 2008 to 12 billion yen from 66 billion yen on dropping sales, a strong yen and a write-down of some U.S. assets.  In Seoul, Hyundai Motor Co. (HYMLF) sank 5.2%, and Kia Motors Corp. (KIMTF) skidded 4.3% -- on top of their double-digit percentage declines in the previous session -- after they also cut their sales forecast earlier this week.  National Australia Bank (NABZY) shares gained 1.7% after the banking major said discussions to purchase Wizard's brand name, distribution network and prime mortgages had ended with their offer rejected.  Shares of Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AU), however, slipped 0.6% after the bank said it will acquire up to A$4 billion of home loans originated by Wizard.  In Hong Kong, the decline was led by market heavyweights, with HSBC (HBC) slipping 0.6%, while China Mobile (CHL) gave up 1.5%.  February crude-oil futures rose 10 cents to $39.08 a barrel in electronic trading, after falling 93 cents to $38.98 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  In Asian currency trading, the U.S. dollar changed hands for 90.39 yen, compared with 90.57 yen Tuesday.  Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 1.2% to 8,419.49, and the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index (SPX) gave up 1% to 863.16, while the Nasdaq Composite (RIXF) shed 0.7% to 1,521.54.  The decline came after data showed the U.S. economy contracted at a 0.5% annual rate in the third quarter, unrevised from last month's preliminary estimate.  Data also showed re-sales of U.S. single-family homes and condos fell a greater-than-expected 8.6% in November to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 4.49 million, even as home prices dropped at the fastest annual pace on record.
