ReutersToronto stocks made gains on Monday as oil and commodities rose.  Canadian stocks picked up on Friday's late rally momentum and cruised to their biggest gains in more than a week Monday.  Driven by a much-needed bounce in commodity prices and word from south of the border that a massive public works stimulus package is on the way, the S&amp;amp;P/TSX Composite Index ended Monday's session up 450.09 points or 5.54% to 8567.12 as all 10 sector indices closed in positive territory. The TSX Venture exchange was also up, rising 13.30 points or 1.94% to 697.61, while the Canadian dollar rose 1.06 cents to US79.74.  Energy and metals stocks led the charge in Toronto as commodity prices got a reprieve from last week's sell-off. Crude oil was up US$2.90 to US$43.71 to reverse a week-long rout that saw prices fall 23% to their lowest level since Dec. 10, 2004. The S&amp;amp;P/TSX Energy subindex jumped 6.5% to 2034.26 points. The Materials subindex rose 8.9% to 1778.92 points, as copper prices, widely regarded as the most economically sensitive base metal, broke through US$1.50 in intraday trading. Gold prices climbed US$17.10 to US$769.30.  David Baskin, president of Baskin Financial Services Inc. in Toronto, said his enthusiasm for the latest mini-rally in the country's benchmark exchange is tempered by the fact that oil prices remain at significantly low levels.  'Oil bounced yesterday as OPEC continues to bang on the barrel about cutting supply,' he said. 'But until we see oil go up and show some sustainability, the Toronto exchange is going to be hampered.'  Mr. Baskin said the more encouraging sign over the past couple of trading sessions is the growing investor confidence in the financials sector.  'We've seen the banks now report and the insurance companies now report. People are by and large comfortable with what they have seen,' Mr. Baskin said. The Financials subindex was up more than 49.83 points to 1164.40 and has risen 10% after hitting a low of 1051.09 on Nov. 20. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which was upgraded to an 'Active List Buy' at TD Newcrest, rose $3.52, or 7% to $53.27.  In addition to the Energy, Materials and Financials stocks, there was also good action in the Industrials group Monday. Construction firms, SNC-Lavalin Inc. and Stantec Inc., were up 8% and 6%, respectively, after President-Elect Barack Obama said this weekend he will increase infrastructure spending for investment in roads, bridges and public buildings in order to curb record job losses in the country. Last Friday, The U.S. Labor Department reported that U.S. employers shed 533,000 jobs in November, the worst monthly loss of jobs since 1974.  In the United States, stocks rose on the Obama pledge and belief that a bailout of the U.S. auto industry is around the corner. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 298.76 points, or 3.46%, to 8934.18, with General Motors Corp. up 20% and Ford Motor Company up 24%. The S&amp;amp;P 500 climbed 33.63 points or 3.84% to 909.70 while the Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 62.43 points, or 4.14% to 1571.74.
