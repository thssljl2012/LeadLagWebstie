SYDNEY, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Australian stocks rose 2.3 percent on Monday as global miners such as BHP Billiton Ltd jumped on expectations of a rebound in metal prices, but phone company Telstra Corp Ltd dived to a two-year low. Telstra, the most active stock, posted its biggest one-day percentage fall since listing 11 years ago after the government dumped it from a bidding process to build a $6.6 billion national broadband network, calling its bid incomplete.

'Reading between the lines, it's just a commercial decision they (Telstra) made. They believe it wouldn't generate a sufficient return for them and contains measurable risk.' The 12 percent slide in Telstra's shares to its lowest close since November 2006 pulled the market off its highs above 3,600. 'All eyes are on tonight's offshore markets' performance. If they come through with some positive signals, the market may have a chance to go up again. If not, there will be a consolidation phase between 3,200 and 3,600 for the time being,' Hung said. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index gained 81 points to close at 3,591.4, according to the latest available data, recovering from Friday's 2.4 percent fall. New Zealand's NZX50 index lost half a point to close at 2,676.4. BHP Billiton Ltd, the world's top miner, led the Australian market higher, adding 7.2 percent to A$30.90, still about 38 percent down from its life-high of A$50.00 reached in May 2008. Rival Rio Tinto Ltd firmed 10.2 percent to A$39.90, down about 75 percent from its life high of A$157.45 in May. Property investor Macquarie Office Trust surged 27 percent to A$0.26 after announcing A$800 million ($530 million) in capital raising, including a A$508 million share sale. Of key comfort to investors was a lenders' agreement to scrap MOF's gearing and market capitalisation triggers in its debt covenant. For more, click on. APA Group Ltd, Australia's biggest gas pipeline owner, rose 6.7 percent to A$2.70 after saying it would cut its debt by A$647 million with the proceeds from selling some of its assets into an unlisted fund. Centro Properties Group was on a trading halt ahead of a midnight deadline for it to secure an extension on $3.7 billion in debt from U.S. and Australian lenders or face collapse. Its biggest Australian lender, Commonwealth Bank of Australia , eased 0.4 percent to A$28.05, while National Australia Bank slipped 0.5 percent to A$19.01. The other two major banks, Westpac Banking Corp and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group both rose around 3 percent. HFA Holdings Ltd, a hedge funds manager, jumped as much as 17 percent to A$0.14 then finished steady after saying it had no exposure to Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities LLC. Madoff, a prominent Wall Street trader, was arrested last week after he told senior staff that his money management operations were basically a giant 'Ponzi' scheme, with his alleged fraud estimated at $50 billion. Commonwealth Bank and ANZ also said they had no exposure to Madoff.
