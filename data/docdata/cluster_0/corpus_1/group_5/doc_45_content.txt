(Recasts; adds trader's quote, background)  MEXICO CITY, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Mexico's peso weakened sharply on Tuesday on doubts about whether lawmakers in Washington would do enough to rescue ailing U.S. automakers, whose output in Mexico is a key part of the local economy.  The peso  MEX01 lost 1.05 percent to 13.582 per dollar at the central bank's final reference.  Negotiators from Congress and the White House pushed to clinch a deal on Tuesday that would clear the way for a $15 billion bailout of U.S. automakers.  Some traders doubted the aid package would be enough to save Chrysler LLC and General Motors (GM.N: Quote, Profile, Research).  'Even if they pass this, it isn't going to solve all the automakers' problems,' said a trader in Mexico City.  'The next two years is going to about holding on, resisting, and see which companies hold up and which go bankrupt. There are still going to be a lot of job cuts and that will hit consumption,' said a trader in Mexico City.  U.S. automakers have major operations in Mexico and vehicles and parts account for one-fifth of Mexico's exports.  The IPC stock index .MXX gained 0.77 percent to 21,331 points, giving up earlier gains of more than 2 percent as U.S. stocks fell on worries of a deepening recession in the United States.
