By Simone Giuliani MELBOURNE, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Australian stocks cheered in the Christmas holidays with a 1.4 percent gain on Wednesday, as hopes economic bad news had been more than priced in sent shares such as miner Rio Tinto Ltd higher. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index rose 50.8 points to 3,582.2 in the thin trade of a shortened session. The market closed two hours early ahead of Christmas holidays and will reopen on Dec 29. Brokers said most investors were happy to head off for holidays, putting the index's around 44 percent fall so far this year behind them and focussing on the outlook for next year instead. 'We see much more of a wide-ranging but ultimately sideways market and economy ahead,' said Andrew Quinn, research strategy coordinator at Patersons Securities. This meant investors would be much more focussed on finding the value in individual stocks, he said. Global miner Rio Tinto paced the gains, advancing 1.2 percent to A$36.59 after having slipped nine percent in the past two days. Rival BHP Billiton Ltd also rose 1.2 percent taking its share price to A$28.84 after having dropped nearly five percent in the past two days. The gains came even after copper and nickel prices dropped, news that Spain had joined a growing list of countries in recession and data that showed U.S. home sales and prices both fell at a record pace last month. 'Our market has been beaten down so much ... that it is absorbing some of the bad news,' said Shaw Stockbroking senior dealer Jamie Spiteri. 'There is the capacity for our market to show some resilience.' National Australia Bank gained 2.6 percent to A$20.11 after the nation's top lender said it had ended talks to buy non-bank lender Wizard. Rival Commonwealth Bank of Australia also gained after the group said it would buy up to A$4 billion of home loans originated by Wizard. CBA rose 0.4 percent to A$27.15. For more click on.
