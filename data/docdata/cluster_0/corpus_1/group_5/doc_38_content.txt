A leading resource analyst at ANZ Bank says almost half of all mining companies in Australia are currently operating at a loss.  ANZ's head of commodities research Mark Pervan says contract prices for coal have dropped significantly since last year and further drops are forecast when contracts are renegotiated in early 2009.  Mr Pervan says smaller miners will be hardest hit and coal is the most vulnerable resource. 'It has been held up very strongly by some very tight supply issues, but also some very strong demand out of Asia, so it does look vulnerable to corrections,' he said. 'The base metals have sort of taken their medicine now by basically on a spot market they know the price straight away, whereas there's a looming downside issue coming for the coal industry. 'I think that coal doesn't look too good in this current environment.'Mr Pervan believes conditions should improve from mid-2009. 'There's a supply issue looming, in a sense that there isn't a lot of supply about and if you start to see some sign of life on the demand side, then that could actually see prices recover,' he said. '2010 I think will be a much better year than 2009 - if producers can hold out through the next six to nine months, on the other side of this is some pretty encouraging conditions.'
