'Westpac threw the cat amongst the pigeons with its (capital) raising... so we saw weakness overall in the banking sector.''  'The real disappointment is following on from Rio last night - it had a massive move in London and hasn't really continued here.  'But I guess the spectre of capital raising is weighing on that stock so until we have some clarity there, we won't see any rallies of that stock.''
