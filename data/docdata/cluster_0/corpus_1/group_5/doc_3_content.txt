THE sharemarket was marginally lower at noon as the mining giants lost ground but retailers and brewers were stronger.  At 12.03pm (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 12.9 points, or 0.36 per cent, to 3544.5, while the broader All Ordinaries index fell 11.9 points, or 0.34 per cent, to 3480.4.  CommSec market analyst Steven Daghlian said the market had see-sawed in and out of negative territory in morning trade.  Mr Daghlian said the resources sector was lower after figures from Asia showed that oil and base metal consumption in China, Australia's second largest export market, was slowing down more quickly than expected initially.  'The oil price fell 6 per cent yesterday, so we're seeing some weakness in energy stocks,'' he said.  At 12.05pm AEDT, Woodside was down 19 cents at $32.56, Santos was up 34 cents, or 2.5 per cent, at $13.96 and Oil Search inched 3 cents higher to $4.03.  Australia's largest energy retailer, AGL Energy, and Sydney Gas both have gone into trading halts pending an announcement about a material transaction, which the latter says is in relation to a takeover bid.  CommSec market analyst Savanth Sebastian said it appeared the announcements were related.  AGL last traded at $15.45 and Sydney Gas at 27.5 cents.  At 12.08pm AEDT, mining giant BHP Billiton had retreated 68 cents, or 2.29 per cent, to $28.96 while rival Rio Tinto had given up $1.05, or 2.81 per cent, to $36.35.  Mr Daghlian said the retail sector largely was stronger, 'but it is a bit too early to say whether the federal government's economic stimulus payments have boosted last-minute festive trading''.  At 12.06pm AEDT, Coles and Bunnings owner Wesfarmers was down 5 cents to $16.57, rival Woolworths had gained 13 cents to $26.22, David Jones had added 3 cents, or 1.03 per cent, to $2.95.  Harvey Norman crept 1 cent higher to $2.36, after saying yesterday that like-for-like sales for the 28 days to December 21 were 8.7 per cent higher than last year.  Brewer Lion Nathan, which seeks to merge with Coca Cola Amatil, added 23 cents to $7.64, while Fosters Group gained 24 cents to $5.49.  Banks were mixed.  Commonwealth Bank was up 34 cents to $27.40, NAB advanced 13 cents to $19.74, ANZ shed 17 cents to $14.69 and Westpac dipped 39 cents to $16.39.  Shares in Bendigo and Adelaide Bank fell 86 cents, or 7.33 per cent, to $10.88 after it said it had raised $175 million via a share purchase plan and an institutional placement.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange at 1204 AEDT, the March share price index contract was 19 points lower at 3,534 on a volume of 6,914 contracts.
