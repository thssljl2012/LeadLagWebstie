'We are following on from a more positive lead on Friday from the US,'' Macquarie Equities Brisbane adviser Helen Spencer said. 'The negative result we were anticipating from the auto makers issue wasn't quite as negative, so we are making up on a bit of lost ground on the back of that.'' 'Financials are faring exceptionally well as is the resource sector.''   Telstra shares fell sharply at the open, losing around 6 per cent after  from the bidding process for the national broadband network on 'trivial grounds'. 'The news was poorly received by the market and the stock is down six per cent,'' Ms Spencer said.   The major miners were all in positive territory.
