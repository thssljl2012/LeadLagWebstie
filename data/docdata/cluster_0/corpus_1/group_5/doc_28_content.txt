The sharemarket has largely recovered losses after a dive at the open of trading this morning fuelled by the World Banks release of a grim outlook for the global economy in 2009.  The S&amp;amp;P-ASX 200 was down 8.8 points, or 0.24 per cent, to 3595.5 at 8.35am Perth time while the all-ordinaries index slipped 6.3 points to 3527.4.  The early sharemarket movement comes after the World Bank released its Global Economic Prospects report, which forecast the global economy would expand by just 0.9 per cent while trade volume would fall for the first time in 26 years.  Commonwealth Bank plummeted early for the second consecutive day on the back of the forecast, down 3.2 per cent, or 97, to $29.03. Westpac also sank $1.47, or 8.2 per cent, to $16.41 while National Australia Bank slipped 10 to $19.80 and ANZ was up 13 to $14.23.  The resources sector was stronger for the second consecutive day with BHP Billiton rising 58 to $29.03 and Rio Tinto climbing 52 to $33.87 while Fortescue Metals Group was also up 12 to $2.46.  WA mineral sands producer Iluka Resources gained 3 to $4.73 after announcing it now expected its net profit after tax for the year to December 31 to come in at $60 million  $10 million up on its previous estimate.  In WA stocks Woodside Petroleum rose 20 to $32.63 and Wesfarmers was up 23 to $16.79.  The open to local trading follows a drop overnight in the Dow Jones industrial average, which sank 242.85 points, or 2.72 per cent, to 8691.33 while the Nasdaq composite index also dropped 24.40 points to 1547.34.  Growing uncertainty over a multi-billion dollar rescue plan for the US auto industry and moves by investors to lock in gains from the previous two-day market rally were cited as reasons behind the fall on Wall Street.  Conversely European stock exchanges posted gains for a second straight day yesterday with the London FTSE 100 index climbing 81.2 points, or 1.89 per cent, to 4381.26 riding on better-than-expected economic data from Germany.  Japanese stocks also edged higher yesterday fuelled by hopes of a new economic stimulus package out of the US with the benchmark Nikkei-225 index adding 66.82 points to 8395.87.  The benchmark Hang Seng index instead closed down 291.65 points at 14,753.22.
