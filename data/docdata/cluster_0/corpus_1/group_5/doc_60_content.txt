HONG KONG, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Shares of China Construction Bank fell on Monday after Bank of America said a Hong Kong newspaper report that it planned to sell some of its shares in the bank was untrue. The stock fell as much as 5 percent to a session low of HK$4.36, underperforming a 2.3 percent rise in the index for major Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong. A source close to the Chinese bank also told Reuters earlier that the report was untrue. Bank of America, which currently owns 44.71 billion H-shares or 19.13 percent of the issued share capital of China Construction Bank, aims to sell some of the Chinese bank shares at more than a 10 percent discount to raise up to $3 billion, Apple Daily reported, citing market sources.
