Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  AFTER a flat start, the share market was in the red at noon as falling banking stocks capped gains in the resources sector.  At 12pm (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 33 points, or 0.91 per cent, at 3,598.6, while the broader All Ordinaries index lost 25.6 points, or 0.72 per cent, to 3,528.2.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index contract was 53 points lower at 3590 on a volume of 18,731 contracts.  IG Markets research analyst Ben Potter said Westpac's announcement of a $2.5 billion placement to institutional investors was well received.  'People say it's good to get it over and done with, and I would say it will be oversubscribed,' Mr Potter said.  'It's set the cat among the pigeons: a lot of funds are selling pretty much across the board so they can take part in the raising, purchasing at $16, which is a very attractive price.'  The bank's shares are in a trading halt and last traded at $17.88.  Westpac said the capital raising would strengthen its balance sheet and position it for growth.  'Commonwealth are down heavily and they were the ones tipped to do the next capital raising - they are seen to be the neediest,' Mr Potter said.  'But Westpac has beaten them to it.'  At 12.02pm (AEDT), Commonwealth Bank retreated $2.7, or 6.62 per cent, to $30.63, NAB gave up 68 cents, or 3.24 per cent, to $20.28 and ANZ slipped 38 cents, or 2.55 per cent, to $14.55.  Higher commodity prices drove BHP Billiton shares 4.7 per cent, or $1.28, higher to $28.50 while fellow mining giant Rio Tinto advanced 97 cents, or 3.02 per cent, to $33.05.  Mr Potter said Wall Street was expected to pull back from recent gains because the market had already factored in forthcoming economic stimulus measures, driving the S&amp;amp;P500 index to positive territory in nine out of the past 11 sessions.  'People may be wary that the market may have got a bit ahead of itself,' he said.  '(President elect) Obama is not going to announce them until January and they are not going to hit the economy until March, April.'  He said trading volumes world-wide were currently 'pretty light'.
