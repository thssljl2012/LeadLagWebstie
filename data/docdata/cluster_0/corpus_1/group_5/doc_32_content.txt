THE share market closed 4 per cent higher, boosted by gains in the financial and resources sector and a rally on United States markets on Friday.  At the 4.15pm (AEDT) close, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index had gained 141.7 points, or 4.06 per cent, to 3631.6, while the broader All Ordinaries was up 126.6 points or 3.69 per cent, at 3553.8.  CMC Markets analyst David Taylor said despite grim global economic data much of it had already been factored into the market, bargain-hunters were snapping up cheap stocks. 'Today was a broad-based buying opportunity for anyone hungry to get back in,'' he said.  Mr Taylor said the materials and financials sectors led the market upwards, with energy stocks boosted by a higher price for oil in Asian trading and speculation that Santos could become a takeover target. 'This meant that our oil stocks did exceptionally well,'' he said. 'The energy sector has pushed up behind the finance and materials sector and provided an extremely good base for the whole market to push ahead.''  The financial sector was up, with all the major players posting gains.   NAB rose $1.15 to $20.96, Commonwealth Bank lifted $1.90 to $32.80, Westpac gained $1.03 to $17.88 and ANZ improved 33 cents to $14.93.  It was a similar story in the resource sector.  BHP Billiton was up $1.07 to $27.22 and Rio Tinto added 8 cents to $32.08.  Ivanhoe Australia surged 23.08 per cent to 32 cents after high-grade molybdenum and rhenium were discovered at its Mount Dore project in Queensland's Cloncurry region.  Santos jumped 9.05 per cent to $13.25 amid rumours that a Chinese company was considering teaming up with a partner to make a joint bid for the Australian group.  Oil and gas provider Woodside Petroleum was up 8.5 per cent at $33.05.  The retail sector was also boosted with the major players all posting gains.  Wesfarmers, which owns Coles, ascended 47 cents to $16.98 and Woolworths picked up 73 cents at $26.82.  In the gold sector, Lihir stepped forward 7 cents to $2.32, Newmont was steady at $4.65 and Newcrest was $1.09 stronger at $26.17.   The price of gold in Sydney at 4.26pm was $US764.30 per fine ounce, down $US2.90 on Friday's close of $US767.20.   Among media stocks Consolidated Media rose 22 cents to $2.20 and Fairfax dipped 1.5 cents to $1.45.  News Corporation (the parent company of the publisher of news.com.au) was up 36 cents to $13.25.  Among other stocks, Qantas lifted 16 cents to $2.38 as chief executive Alan Joyce said there would be major benefits if the airline merged with British Airways, but there were still a number of hurdles to overcome.  Clothing manufacturer Pacific Brands sagged 2 cents to 58.5 cents as it denied it was planning a capital raising after deteriorating retail conditions forced the company to revise its dividend policy.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange the December share price index futures contract was up 112 points at 3635 on a volume of 32,325 contracts, according to preliminary calculations.
