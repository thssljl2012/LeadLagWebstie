JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African blue-chips shot up 8 percent and the rand firmed 2 percent against the dollar on Monday as hopes that a U.S. infrastructure plan would cushion an economic downturn spurred global equities.  The Johannesburg Top-40 index of blue-chip stocks gained 8.01 percent to 18,718.38 points, its biggest one-day percentage increase in years, while the broader All-share index rose 7.07 percent to 20,643.43 points. 'Barack Obama talking about his ideas for getting us out of these problems really helped the market, plus U.S. futures have been very strong today and Europe is firmer so all that is a recipe for a good day locally,' said Garth Mackenzie, head of derivatives trading at BOE Private Clients. 'Mining stocks got smashed last week so are coming off oversold levels, I think we've got a bit of an end of year rally coming.' Global equity markets surged after President-elect Barack Obama at the weekend unveiled plans for the biggest U.S. infrastructure investment since the 1950s.  The rand traded 2 percent stronger at 10.0930 to the greenback at 1538 GMT, compared to 10.2970 at Friday's close, having earlier reached a session high of 10.08. 'I think all in all the rand has traded ... with a firmer tone. We have seen across the board that all the risky assets have performed better,' said Absa Capital trader Duncan Howes.  The short-term outlook for the rand remains positive, with support seen around the 10.00 area, but it could succumb to a lack of liquidity in the market medium-term, ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays, Howes added.  On the bourse, stronger metal prices helped buoy heavily-weighted resource stocks, such as diversified mining giant Anglo American, which leapt 13.98 percent to 214 rand.  Steel maker ArcelorMittal SA, the local arm of the global behemoth, raced 13.56 percent higher to 90 rand while BHP Billiton jumped 13.87 percent to 167.90 rand.  AngloGold Ashanti climbed 8.82 percent to 247 rand and Gold Fields rose 14.52 percent to 85 rand, as the price of bullion surged on the back of higher oil prices, a weaker dollar and investor concerns about inflationary pressures.  Platinum also rose more than 6 percent on growing optimism about a bailout fot the auto industry, helping Anglo Platinum rise 8.24 percent to 400.50 rand and Impala Platinum climb 6.64 percent to 117.30 rand.  Construction firm Murray &amp;amp; Roberts rose 6.32 percent to 41.41 rand after it said its Dubai joint venture had won a contract to build a terminal at Dubai's international airport and its share of the tender was 6 billion rand.  Higher oil prices helped boost petrochemicals firm Sasol 11.55 percent to 270.50 rand.  Government bonds followed the rand firmer, and yields headed lower in turn. The yield on the benchmark 2015 bond slipped 1.5 basis points to 8.095 percent and that on the 2036 bond was down half a basis point at 7.65 percent.  Traders say the rand and bond markets have largely discounted a likely 50 basis points interest rate cut on Thursday when the central bank concludes a two-day meeting.  The domestic currency is presently down over 30 percent against the dollar since the start of the year, weighed down by the risk aversion that has accompanied a global financial crisis.
