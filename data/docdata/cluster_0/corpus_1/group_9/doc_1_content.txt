Global stocks rose on Wednesday after U.S. home sales and manufacturing data offered investors a glimmer of hope that a deep recession was easing, but oil fell as 16-year highs in U.S. crude inventories sent the opposite message.  The U.S. dollar rose against the euro but was little changed against the yen as caution before a Group of 20 summit in London and a European Central Bank meeting blunted news of more steep U.S. job losses last month.  Oil fell more than 4.0 percent at one point to below $48, pressured by the bearish economic news and the surprising rise in U.S. crude inventories.  Yields on shorter-dated euro zone government bonds fell to their lowest in three weeks on the eve of a widely expected ECB rate cut, but rising equity prices kept a lid on longer-dated debt in Europe.  Financial shares turned around following the manufacturing and homes data as investors bet an improvement in the economic outlook will boost financial activity.  JPMorgan Chase up 4.1 percent to $27.66 while Bank of America gained 3.8 percent to $7.08. The contraction in U.S. factory activity slowed in March, and U.S. construction spending fell at a slower-than-expected rate in February, data that investors in equity markets took as a sign recovery may be on the horizon.  Financial shares turned around following release of the data on bets an improving economy will boost financial activity. JPMorgan Chase up 3.7 percent to $27.56 while Bank of America gained 3.5 percent to $7.06. In Europe, Barclays rose 6.1 percent, Credit Suisse gained 5.9 percent and BNP Paribas added 5.5 percent. ING rose 8.4 percent.  A slightly better-than-expected reading of 36.3 in the U.S. Institute for Supply Management index sparked a turnaround in European markets. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. 'It is still below 50 but it is very positive,' said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, equity strategist at Postbank in Bonn, Germany. 'It is good news after the bad news that already came in,' Sonnenschein said, referring to the ADP private sector jobs report that shows 742,000 positions were cut in March.  Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James Financial in St Petersburg, Florida, said the jobs number was 'somewhat' encouraging. It's not a major improvement but it feels ... that the rate of decline is diminishing,' Saut said. Before 1 p.m. New York time (6 p.m. British time), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 108.00 points, or 1.42 percent, at 7,716.92. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index was up 9.02 points, or 1.13 percent, at 806.89. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 17.05 points, or 1.12 percent, at 1,545.64.  The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed 1.6 percent higher at 745.14 points.  Oil prices fell after the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported a 2.8 million barrel rise in crude oil inventories. Gasoline stockpiles increased by 2.2 million barrels, counter to forecasts of a 1.4 million-barrel decline. 'There is no indication in these numbers that the economy is strengthening. It looks like more of the same,' said Joseph Arsenio, managing director at Arsenio Capital Management in Larkspur, California.  U.S. light sweet crude oil fell $1.95 to $47.71 a barrel. The dollar was up against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index up 0.17 percent at 85.658.  The euro was down 0.27 percent at $1.3214. Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.03 percent at 98.87.  Jessica Hoversen, a currency analyst at MF Global in Chicago, called ADP 'a really bad number' that bodes ill for the government's more comprehensive jobs report on Friday.  But she said the G20 meeting and an expected ECB interest rate cut on Thursday 'will keep a lid' on price action. The ECB is expected to cut interest rates to 1 percent on Thursday. Markets are on alert for any sign officials are moving towards unconventional policy measures such as buying corporate or government debt to boost the money supply.  The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was unchanged in price to yield at 2.67 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note fell 2/32 in price to yield 0.83 percent.  Japan's Nikkei average surged 3 percent but other Asian stocks started the quarter more cautiously. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan pared bigger gains to trade up 0.6 percent.
