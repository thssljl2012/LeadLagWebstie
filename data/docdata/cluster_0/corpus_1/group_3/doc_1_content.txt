(BizWorld) European shares rose in choppy early trade this morning, supported by the passage of a USD 700 billion bailout package for the financial sector by the U.S. Senate, but concerns about the health of banks persisted. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.4 percent at 1,076.72 points, after closing 0.9 percent higher yesterday.Banking stocks were the top weighted gainers on the index, with HBOS rising 9.2 percent, Lloyds TSB rising 3.4 percent and Fortis gaining 5.7 percent. Switzerland's UBS AG rose 7 percent after the bank said it would make a small profit in the third quarter after a year of losses, signalling it had started to turn the corner even as the credit crisis still engulfed many U.S. and European peers.In Paris this morning the CAC index was up by 5.83 points to 4,060.37, though in Frankfurt the DAX was down by 14.40 points at 5,792.93.In London a short time ago the FTSE 100 index was 38.07 points higher at 4,997.66. Investors were awaiting the European Central Bank's rate decision at 1145 GMT. The bank is expected to keep rates on hold at 4.25 percent, but its views on the global financial crisis will be scrutinised by the market.'There is mounting pressure on the central bank to cut key rates to help crisis-ridden banks and ward off the increasing risks to the economy,' German bank Helaba said.The support for the banking sector came from the U.S. Senate, which approved the rescue package late on Wednesday, putting pressure on the House to approve a plan that political and financial leaders called crucial to averting economic catastrophe.Copyright: Thomson Financial Previous StoryNext Story
