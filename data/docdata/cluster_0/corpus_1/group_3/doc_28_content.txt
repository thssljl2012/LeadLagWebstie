'Even if the bailout gets done, it's not going to solve everything immediately. The slowdown will have to work itself out for demand to take off again.' If prices keep falling, some analysts say OPEC countries may act to defend the $100 per-barrel level. The cartel earlier this month said it would reduce output by 520,000 barrels a day. 'There is a chance that OPEC would cut production in coming months on the back of ongoing and potentially greater demand weakness,' said Costanza Jacazio, an oil analyst with Barclays Capital in New York.Prices are expected to fall further as U.S. Gulf energy output ramps back up after the passage of Hurricanes Ike and Gustav.
