Article from: AAPFont size: Decrease Increase: Email: PrintTHE dollar closed firmer today, at just under $US70c, as the spot price of gold recovered and the local share market rallied.Despite the highest quarterly producer prices index in a decade, the dollar rose as financial markets continued to look forward to interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia (At 5.00pm (AEDT).The dollar was trading at up 1 US cent, to $US0.6993/96.CMC Markets foreign exchange dealer Tim Waterer said a 4 per cent rise in the Australian share market also helped the local currency.'For most part, the Aussie dollar has got a lift from the strong performance of the local stock market and the rise in the gold price today,'' he said.The local currency moved between an early morning low of $US0.6886 and a late afternoon high of $US0.7010.In late afternoon trade, the dollar gained momentum as the gold price jumped to $US808 per fine ounce.The dollar had a short-lived bounce in the morning after Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed the biggest quarterly jump in producer prices since the series began in 1998 - up 2 per cent in the September quarter.Mr Waterer said traders overlooked the high producer price numbers, because financial markets are still expecting the RBA to cut rates before Christmas amid the global financial market turmoil.'Even though it (the PPI) was higher than normal, obviously expectations are for rates to fall not rise in Australia,'' he said.The Australian dollar was expected to take direction during offshore trade from the New York Stock Exchange, with Mr Waterer tipping a high of $US0.7200 or a possible low of 0.6700 depending on the strength of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
