HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Asian markets extended losses early Monday amid concerns about the global financial crisis, with Japanese shares down sharply on banks such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and exporters including Sony Corp., which fell below a five-year low. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average slumped as low as 10,598.76 during the session to its lowest level since October 2004. The benchmark was recently down 3% at 10,605.12, taking losses into a third straight session, while the broader Topix index fell 3.3% to 1,013.34. Australia's S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 shed 2.6% to 4,574.40, and South Korea's Kospi lost 3% to 1,377.08, while New Zealand's NZX 50 index dropped 2.4% to 3,075.25. The decline came in spite of the passage into law of the $700 billion U.S. financial rescue package last week, as investors worried about the spread of the global crisis to Germany. Germany on Sunday explicitly guaranteed deposits in banks held by individuals, hours before German officials set up a 50 billion euro ($68 billion) bailout of troubled commercial property lender Hypo Real Estate to avoid broader damage to Europe's largest economy.
