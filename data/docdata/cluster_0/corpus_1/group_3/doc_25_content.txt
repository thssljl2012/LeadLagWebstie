OIL prices rebounded today after Libya called on crude producers to cut output to protect their incomes if the market continued trading at current levels.Crude oil futures have in recent days traded within a band of about $US80-95 a barrel, well off the record highs of $US147 reached in July.New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in November, jumped $US2.22 to $US90.03 a barrel in electronic deals today, recovering from sharp falls suffered yesterday.Brent North Sea crude for November gained $US1.40 to $US85.08 a barrel.Oil had nosedived under $US90 per barrel yesterday, hitting eight-month low points, as deepening global financial turmoil and plunging stock markets raised fears about slowing demand.'If the price level continues as it is we are seriously thinking of cutting down our production and calling other member countries in OPEC, and non-OPEC producing countries, to cut their production to safeguard their incomes,' Shukri Ghanem said by telephone.'We are very much worried about this drop of the price,' said Mr Ghanem, who is Libya's representative in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).'We will think that all producing countries should take a unified view and should try to do something to stop the deterioration of the prices,' said Mr Ghanem, who is also chairman of the Libyan National Oil Corporation (NOC).Lower oil prices translate into falling revenues for members of the 13-nation OPEC cartel.Mr Ghanem also said that he would support an emergency meeting of OPEC oil ministers to discuss the issue.In September, OPEC decided to cut its production of 520,000 barrels of oil per day, to sustain oil prices above $US100 a barrel.The Libyan comments come one day after OPEC vice president Galo Chiriboga, who is Ecuador's oil minister, said that volatile world financial markets could affect oil prices and force the cartel to take action.The market was also bolstered today by growing hopes that the world's central banks could cut their interest rates in a bid to boost troubled financial markets.'Prices were higher (today) amid technical buying, androwing optimism global central banks may cut rates to ease fears, after the Reserve Bank of Australia slashed interest rates by 1.0 per cent,' said Sucden analyst Nimit Khamar.The cost of crude oil has plummeted by about 40 per cent since striking record heights above $US147 in July, as the market has been dragged down by fears of weakening economic growth and slowing demand.Capital Economics analyst Julian Jessop forecast that prices could soon slump to $US80 per barrel.'To our mind, prices much above $US100 per barrel are now clearly unsustainable,' said Mr Jessop. 'We think that oil prices will decline to $US80 per barrel in the coming weeks and perhaps as low as $US50 in the coming year.'
