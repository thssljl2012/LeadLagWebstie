OIL prices rallied today, lifted by a burst of optimism after world leaders formed a united front to tackle the global financial crisis.New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in November, leapt $US3.49 to close at $US81.19 a barrel, recovering from one-year lows hit Saturday. In London, Brent North Sea crude for November gained $US3.37 to $US77.46. 'Oil prices were higher after world leaders rushed out plans over the weekend to help stabilize their banking systems,' said Sucden analyst Nimit Khamar. 'The announcements over the weekend helped lift sentiment and calmed fears of a global recession, which buoyed oil prices after heavy losses last week.' European markets cheered an action plan to combat the crisis agreed by the eurozone's 15 nations yesterday that includes a guarantee of interbank lending and the option of recapitalizing banks. The euphoria was echoed on Wall Street. The Treasury announced overnight that it was gearing up to buy stakes in ailing financial firms, under a $US700 billion banking rescue package approved 10 days ago. On Saturday, amid a record rout on global stock markets, the New York oil contract had plunged nearly $US9 to its lowest level since October 2007, at $US77.70, well below its record peaks above $US147 in July. 'It appears the utter lack of confidence exhibited on Friday is being replaced with a modicum of confidence,' said John Kilduff, analyst at MF Global. Iran, the world's fourth-largest oil producer, predicted over the weekend that OPEC would cut oil output at an emergency meeting due next month in the face of slowing demand in a bid to support prices. The 12-nation Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last week announced it would hold a meeting in Vienna on November 18 to discuss the effects of the international financial crisis. 'I think it's certainly on the cards that OPEC might trim production targets in November but we have to wait and see,' said David Moore, a Sydney-based commodity strategist with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Mr Moore said that the cartel was unlikely to want to 'exacerbate the difficult economic situation'. A cut in output could send prices soaring once again. Crude prices broke through $US100 a barrel for the first time at the start of 2008. 'For oil it is clear that the next few days will be defining as the market comes to grips with this changing economic environment,' said Phil Flynn at Alaron Trading. 'Oil that defied economic reality at $US147 a barrel is now in the process of finding a price that the whole world can live with.'
