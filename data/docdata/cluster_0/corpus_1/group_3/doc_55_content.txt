The Australian dollar has opened weaker for the fifth day in a row, hitting another five-year low overnight, as fears of a global recession hindered a recovery in the local unit.Intervention from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) also has failed to give the Australian dollar a sustained boost, with traders reluctant to buy the currency during a time of falling commodity prices.At 7am, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6037/43, down from yesterday's close of $US0.6119/26.During the offshore session, the local currency moved between an early low of $US0.6025 and $US0.6150.The Australian dollar fell to its weakest level since April 11, 2003, last night as the euro dipped to a two-year low against the US currency.The local currency's opening today was weaker even than Friday night's low, which at that point was the worst reading in five and a half years.Bank of America senior currency strategist John Rothfield said the Australian dollar hit its low point last night as the US dollar rallied, but the local unit then struggled as other currencies recovered.''The US dollar was strong and the Aussie went down with everything else,'' he said from San Francisco this morning.''But when the US reversed a little bit as the day went on, the euro rallied but the Australian dollar couldn't completely participate.''The Aussie didn't quite come up so far because people are worried about the risk trade.''Mr Rothfield said RBA action to prop up the Australian dollar had not swayed traders to back the currency, amid a downturn in commodity prices.''I don't think people are necessarily ready to buy the Aussie dollar at the first sign of aggressive (RBA) intervention,'' he said.''It's symptomatic of the global economic cycle.''Australia has a current account deficit and two-thirds of exports are commodities.''Traders were hesistant about buying into the Australian dollar, even though they did not believe it was overvalued, Mr Rothfield said.''People don't want to stand in the way of a falling knife,'' he said.A volatile session on US share markets also impeded the Australian dollar's progress. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.42% lower and the broader Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 index fell 3.18%.The Wall Street action came after Tokyo shares plunged to a 26-year low and Hong Kong fell 12%.With no major domestic economic data out today, the Australian dollar is expected to take direction from risk sentiment on regional equity markets.
