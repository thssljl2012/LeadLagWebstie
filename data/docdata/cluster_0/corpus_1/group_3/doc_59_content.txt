The Australian dollar ended the local session seven per cent higher as a surge in investor confidence on equity markets boosted the domestic currency.At 1700 AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at 68.62 US cents, up from yesterday's close of 64.10 US cents.During the local session, the currency moved between 66.26 US cents and 68.88 US cents.Commonwealth Bank currency strategist Joseph Capurso said rises on equity markets and US Federal Reserve moves to improve liquidity lifted demand for high-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar.Local equity markets ended positively, with the All Ordinaries index closing 3.98 per cent higher while the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 ended up 4.04 per cent.Asian bourses advanced, with the Japanese Nikkei index up 9.96 per cent by 1735 AEDT, while South Korea's KOPSI share index had added 11.95 per cent.'It mainly reflects the increased risk appetite following those big surges in stock markets we have seen over the past few days,' Mr Capurso said.The US Federal Reserve announced separate $US30 billion ($A43.80 billion) swap currency arrangements with the central banks of Brazil, Mexico, Singapore and South Korea.These swap arrangements would reduce the scramble for US dollars, Mr Capurso said.'It has been a really big problem with banks in particular,' he said.
