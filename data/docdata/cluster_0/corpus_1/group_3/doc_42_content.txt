Crude oil was little changed in New York near a 16-month low amid expectations that OPEC's decision to cut production will start to bring supply back in line with demand that is being curbed by the global financial crisis.The 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed October 24 to lower supply by 1.5 million barrels a day starting in November. The group is likely to reduce production further if the latest cut doesn't stabilize prices, Agence France-Presse said, citing an interview Iran's OPEC representative Mohammad Ali Khatibi gave on state television.''The sentiment is negative at the moment so you can't rule out further declines,'' said David Moore, commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. ''OPEC has actually taken a fairly significant step towards tightening the balance between supply and demand. Over time, that may prove somewhat supportive to the oil price.''Crude oil for December delivery was at $US63.93 a barrel down 22 cents, in after-hours electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in Singapore. The contract earlier traded as high as $US64.96.On October 24, the front-month contract fell $US3.69, or 5.4%, to $US64.15, the lowest close since May 31, 2007. Futures are down 31% from a year ago.
