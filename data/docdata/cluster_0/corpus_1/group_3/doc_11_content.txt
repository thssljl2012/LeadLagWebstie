WELLINGTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - New Zealand's benchmark stock index opened 1 percent lower on Wednesday as it followed global markets consumed by fears of a deep recession caused by the financial crisis. The benchmark NZX-50 index fell 29.7 points to 2,974.51 soon after opening, just above two-and-a-half year lows touched on Tuesday. Top stock Telecom Corp. lost 1.4 percent to NZ$2.74, while number two stock Contact Energy was down 1.7 percent at NZ$7.32. The previous day the NZX-50 closed down 1.4 percent, trimming losses after the Reserve Bank of Australia surprised with a hefty 100 basis point rate cut to 6 percent. So far this year the index has fallen 26.4 percent. On Wall Street, stocks fell for the fifth straight day with the Dow Jones industrial average down 5.1 percent, the Standard&amp;amp;Poor's 500 index dropping 5.7 percent and the Nasdaq 5.8 percent lower.
