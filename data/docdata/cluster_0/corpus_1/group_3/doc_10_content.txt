The Australian dollar has opened weaker for the eleventh successive session, losing two US cents overnight as fears about a global slowdown hit commodities-driven currencies.Analysts expect the Australian dollar to fall below $US0.7000 again on Wednesday as lacklustre equity markets hit risk appetite for high interest rate currencies.US Federal Reserve hints at another interest rate cut, and its decision to intervene in the credit market, failed to boost the Australian dollar as the euro rallied against the US unit.At 0700 AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.7053/62, down sharply from Tuesday's close of $US0.7268/75.Overnight, the local currency traded between a low of $US0.7052, reached minutes before the local session began, and a high of $US0.7355, a 4.1 per cent offshore range.While gold and oil prices improved overnight, commodity currencies still faced selling pressure as large falls in base metals prices during the past fortnight reminded traders that global growth was under threat.The Australian dollar was sold off alongside the South African rand, the Brazil real, the New Zealand dollar and the Canadian dollar.Bank of American senior currency strategist John Rothfield said the Australian dollar would keep falling if it sunk to $US0.7000 Wednesday. 'I don't get the sense we're quite there yet,' he said from San Francisco Wednesday morning. 'We think the Australian dollar is undervalued but we wouldn't be a buyer right now. 'It's not likely the Australian dollar has a big further fall to catch up globally, but I think there's flow risk that won't be alleviated until global credit conditions improve.' In New York overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 508.39 points, or 5.11 per cent, to a five-year low of 9,447.11 as investors failed to find reassurance in the US Fed's announcement it would buy short-term commercial paper or company debt in an effort to ease credit blockages. 'This rescue package for the commercial paper market, that's going to help global risk appetite, but right now these markets are under pressure,' Mr Rothfield said. The Australian dollar, which fell below $US0.7000 on Tuesday morning for the first time since September 2004, lost 2.9 per cent during offshore trade.Mr Rothfield said the local currency was holding up well, though, following the Reserve Bank of Australia's surprise decision to cut interest rates by 100 basis points, a scale not seen for 16 years.The cash rate fell to six per cent, where it was in November, 2006, from seven per cent. 'Rate cuts can sometimes be negative for a currency but people feel the Reserve Bank is ahead of the curve than other central banks in supporting the economy,' Mr Rothfield said. 'They feel the Reserve Bank is moving more quickly than expected to a more reflective interest rate in Australia.' US Fed chairman Ben Bernanke told business economists in Washington overnight that US rates could be adjusted in light of financial market turmoil.But the Australian dollar failed to rally against the US currency in tandem with the euro.The Australian dollar has fallen by 28 per cent since reaching a 25-year high of $US0.9849 in mid July, a level previously touched during the fixed exchange rate era.Financial markets are expected to overlook Australian housing finance data for August, due out at 1130 AEDT, and focus on regional share markets.
