THE dollar has opened higher after a choppy weekend session featuring weak US data and a report suggesting the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) may be less aggressive with its monetary policy easing in the months ahead.At 7am AEDT, the dollar was trading at $US0.6971/78, up from Friday's close of $US0.6888/92. During the weekend offshore session, the local currency moved between a low of $US0.6730 and a high of $US0.6990.Bank of New Zealand currency strategist Danica Hampton said weak US data over the weekend prompted a fresh round of US dollar selling, which helped the dollar. But fears of a global recession and a negative finish on US equity markets pushed the dollar off its weekend high, Ms Hampton said. 'The Aussie dollar has really been trading choppily within familiar ranges,' Ms Hampton said from Wellington. The University of Michigan/Reuters survey of US consumer sentiment fell 12.8 index points to 57.5 points in October, the largest one-month decline in the history of the series. Also, the number of US housing starts fell 6.3 per cent in September to 817,000, which was the lowest level in 17 years.Locally, business commentator Terry McCrann wrote in a weekend newspaper column that last week's government stimulus package and an out-of-cycle interest rate cut from the ANZ would result in future monetary policy easing being 'smaller than they would otherwise have been'. 'That might have helped give it (the dollar) a bit of a boost,' Ms Hampton said. RBA governor Glenn Stevens's speech at a business lunch on Tuesday may give further insight into the the central bank's thinking on the direction of monetary policy, Ms Hampton said. 'The RBA are very good at adjusting market expectations ahead of meetings I think, with various speeches or articles,' Ms Hampton said. 'If he is unhappy with how much easing has been priced in, I think we'll probably get a sense of that in the speech.' The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) releases the producer price index for the September quarter at 11.30am AEDT. Ms Hampton said the dollar could push higher this week, but conditions were expected to remain volatile given the uncertain global picture.
