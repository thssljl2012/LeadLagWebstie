Bookmark &amp;amp; ShareAviva shrugged off concerns about its capital position yesterday, and announced sales ahead of forecasts, sending its shares higher.Britain's biggest insurer, which owns Norwich Union, said tumbling stock markets had reduced its capital surplus by 600m from the end of September. But it said its 1.3bn surplus left it in a strong position and that a further fall of 20 per cent in stock markets would cause a further 400m drop, leaving it with a healthy buffer.Aviva's shares rose 5.6 per cent to 259p yesterday, after falling in recent weeks on fears that its capital buffer and dividend could be hit by tumbling market values and rising bond defaults.'The capital and liquidity position of the Aviva group is strong. There is no change to our dividend policy,' Andrew Moss, the chief executive, said. 'We are sure of our position and the statements we have made today.'Aviva beat analysts' expectations with nine-month life and pension sales up 12 per cent to 25.7bn, driven by the US, where business was up by 39 per cent. The US performance offset slower UK sales, which dipped 1 per cent. Mr Moss said that Aviva's shares were severely undervalued in the turmoil surrounding financial stocks and that he believed volatility in the sector's stocks would continue until the end of the year, when Britain's banks are due to complete capital raisings. Mr Moss and three other directors spent 196,840 on 72,000 shares yesterday.Aviva said it was cautious about acquisitions and had been concentrating on conserving capital.With rival Prudential mulling a bid for the Asian assets of AIG, the battered US insurance giant, Philip Scott, Aviva's finance director, said the company was not interested because a deal was too risky: 'Any possible transaction needs to be costed very, very carefully by anybody.'Mr Moss said that with market values falling, Aviva might be forced to renegotiate the terms of its planned 1bn payout to policyholders to take control of the 'inherited estate' of surplus capital in Norwich Union with-profits funds.Interesting?
