THE Australian dollar mounted a recovery yesterday as a surge in investor confidence triggered record gains against the yen.The dollar jumped 8.7 per per cent in 24 hours, touching a morning peak of US65.32c from Tuesday's low of US60.10c.Against the yen, it rose 16 per cent from a low of 55.14 to a peak of 64.79 - the biggest intra-day jump analysts have ever seen.The moves follow a 40 per cent fall in the dollar since it nudged above US98c July.A rally in global sharemarkets was a major reason for the surge, as the more bullish mood enticed investors to chance their arm on high-yielding currencies that have borne the brunt of the rush to safety.The chief currency strategist at the Commonwealth Bank, Richard Grace, said the bounce in sharemarkets reversed some of the recent rush to safety from Japanese and US investors.'As equity markets rose, there was less money being repatriated back to Japan and possibly some being invested in anticipation of further gains in equity markets,' he said.Mr Grace said one reason for the rally was the US Federal Reserve expanding its credit market interventions into short-term private debt.Another reason for the sharp gain against the yen was speculation that the Bank of Japan may begin selling the yen because its strength is hurting Japanese exporters. Speculation that central banks in Japan and the US will cut rates this week is also hurting the yen and the greenback. The chief currency strategist at the NAB, John Kyriakopoulos, said the renewed confidence could act a circuit breaker, providing some respite for the ailing Australian dollar after its plunge in recent months.But as the world economy's outlook deteriorates, forecasters remain downbeat on the dollar, and dismiss any chance it will regain a level near its July highs.The foreign exchange strategist at Deutsche Bank, John Horner, said the sharpness of yesterday's rally was typical of volatile swings in bear markets. 'We now expect a global slowdown as severe as the one in the early 1980s, and that suggests further $A weakness is likely.'The dollar closed at US64.10c, from US61.65c on Tuesday.
