It's the only safe haven out there, otherwise it's red everywhere.''Banks were hit hard. National Australia Bank fell $1.75, or 7.37 per cent, to $21.98, Commonwealth Bank fell $2.41, or 5.68 per cent, to $39.99 and ANZ Banking Group lost $1.03, or 6.19 per cent, to $15.62.Westpacshed $1.30, or 6.05 per cent, to $20.20 and its takeover target St George Bank dropped $1.87, or 6.77 per cent, to $25.77.Amongst the big miners, BHP Billiton was 7.41 per cent lower and its rival and takeover target Rio Tinto declined 6.70 per cent.US shares plunged to fresh five-year lowsovernight in a vicious late-day selloff as jitters intensified over the global financial crunch.The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 678.91 points or 7.3 per cent to close at 8,579.19, the seventh straight loss for the Wall Street index and the first close below 9,000 points since 2003.US President George Bush has scheduled weekend global economic crisis talks at the White House with finance ministers from major wealthy democracies and planned a public address to seek to soothe the upheaval on financial markets and reassure a fearful public after the latest plunge in US stocks.Wall Street has now had its seven-session performance since the period that ended October 26, 1987.Leading the falls in the US overnight was General Motors, which fell by 31 per cent, and financial stocks, such as Morgan Stanley which shed more then a quarter of its market value.Late in Thursday's US session, Standard &amp;amp; Poor's Ratings Services placed its ratings for GM, Ford Motor and their finance arms on watch for further downgrade, citing the rapidly weakening global automotive market and worsening capital-market conditions.Ford shares fell by 22 per cent. Shares in banks and lenders fell further following the expiry of the Securities &amp;amp; Exchange Commission's short-selling ban, and as repeated efforts from central banks and governments to break the freeze in short-term lending markets made little headway.
