THE Australian dollar is carrying some of the weight of the global financial crisis, but a weaker currency will help exporters and tourism, federal Treasurer Wayne Swan says.The dollar opened 3.1 per cent weaker today after fears of a global recession pushed the currency to a five-year low at the weekend.At 1200 AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6212/17, down from Friday's close of $US0.6388/94. During the morning, the local currency moved between $US0.6126 and $US0.6250.The dollar has slumped 38 per cent since mid-July when it hit a 25-year high of 98.49 US cents.In weekend trading it bottomed out at 60.60 US cents, its lowest level since April 2003 on global recession fears.The Australian dollar could slip below 60 US cents and test another five-and-a-half-year low by the end of this week as fears of global recession spur a sell-off, currency strategists said.'There is a variety of influences on the dollar, and I wouldn't speculate on those because in these uncertain times that has its own impact,'' Mr Swan told Fairfax Radio Network today.'It is carrying some of the weight of this global financial crisis, there's no doubt about that.But the dollar's depreciation brought some benefits to the local economy. 'If you are in the tourism industry or an exporter this will certainly provide some relief,'' he said.RBA interventionMeanwhile the Reserve Bank of Australia confirmed it bought the Australian dollar during offshore weekend trade because the foreign exchange market was illiquid.This was only the third time the central bank had intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the local currency since 2001.'We provided some liquidity on Friday night,'' a spokesman for the RBA said. 'Did we buy some Australian dollars on Friday night? Yes we did. 'The FX market was very illiquid.''The RBA source said the central bank was not defending any key level in the Australian dollar, which fell to 60.55 US cents on Friday night for the first time since April 2003. The currency also fell to 55.10 Japanese yen during offshore trade, its lowest point since the end of World War II.The central bank intervened in the currency market in September 2007, in the early days of the credit crunch, and in 2001, when the Australian dollar was worth less than 50 US cents.Crisis impactDuring the weekend session, the local currency moved between $US0.6510 and a low of $US0.6060, the dollar's weakest point since April 15, 2003 when the unit hit 0.6030.Within this 6.9 per cent offshore session range, the dollar slumped to the lowest level since the early days of the Iraq war.Worldwide equity market slides and falling commodity prices contributed to the dollar's dramatic drop on Friday night.Against the low-yielding Japanese yen, the dollar fell to 55.10 yen, which was even weaker than its low point in October 2000.CommSec chief economist Craig James said fears of a global recession hit the commodities-driven dollar as other major currencies also faltered against the US dollar.'The general theme was fear of global recession,' he said this morning.'If you're heading towards a significant downturn and slipping economic growth, then you're likely to use less oil and base metals and as a result there would be less demand for Australian dollars and less demand for the commodities Australia produces.'People are fearful of countries with high debt and current account deficits ... there's a lot against the Aussie. 'There's not a lot pushing the currency higher.'The dollar's low point on Friday night coincided with sharp falls on US equity markets, with the key Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding 3.59 per cent and the broader Standard and Poor's 500 losing 3.45 per cent.Asian and European share markets also lost ground. Key commodities tumbled during the New York session, with copper losing 6.54 per cent.Mr James said market sentiment rather than a particular item of news battered risk appetite for high-yielding currencies on Friday night.He said that in the absence of major domestic economic data today, the dollar was likely to trade between $US0.6150 and 0.6250.Below US60c?Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief currency strategist Richard Grace said the Australian dollar could fall below Friday night's low-point of 60.55 US cents, the weakest level since April 2003.St George chief economist Besa Deda said the prospect of more rate cuts from the RBA and a continuation of financial market turmoil would weigh on the Australian dollar into 2009.'The main reason for the downgrade lies with the deepening of the credit crisis and its knock-on effects to the economy, both the world and domestic economies,'' she said.'The mix of factors that will influence the Australian dollar lower also include a deterioration in the global growth outlook, particularly Asia, weaker commodity prices, heightened risk aversion, a slowing domestic economy, more rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of Australia and a continued period of general strength for the US dollar.''Ms Deda said the Australian dollar was likely to hit 61 US cents by December, fall to 59 US cents in March and recover to 65 US cents in June 2009.
