The Senate gave it the go-head Wednesday.Sprung noted the volatility that has taken hold of the markets following a string of blockbuster announcements in recent weeks that include U.S. government takeovers of mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and insurance giant AIG, along with the bankruptcy-protection filing of Lehman Bros. 'The thing that's very striking about this market is just the size of the downward movement, the volatility, that we have seen lately,' he said. 'Instead of dissipating, the volatility is getting worse.' U.S. markets suffered yesterday, though not as badly as TSX due to less influence from raw-material and energy stocks.
