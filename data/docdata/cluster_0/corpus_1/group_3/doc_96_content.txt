The yen emerged the winner against the dollar and euro on Wednesday, with Japan seen as a relative safehaven in the financial storm amid fears of a sharp and potentially deep recession.Dealers said that even though Japan's economy has slowed sharply, its banks and financial institutions appear to have weathered the crisis better than most and so the currency looks safer for nervous investors.Japanese interest rates are exceptionally low, with the central bank benchmark at 0.5 percent, but that seems to be no disincentive given the current turmoil on the markets.The dollar has traditionally been regarded as the safehaven currency and has generally gained during the crisis despite the United States being the epicentre of the storm.Dealers said that could be explained, in part at least, by US banks, companies and investors selling assets abroad in order to repatriate cash to cover commitments at home, thereby giving the dollar a boost.In late European trade, the euro was at 137.79 yen, down from 139.01 yen in New York late Tuesday.The euro also fell to 1.3547 dollars from 1.3618 dollars.The dollar was lower at 101.54 yen from 102.07 yen.Dealers said the euro was hit by fears of a slowdown in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, after very downbeat remarks by Chancellor Angela Merkel.The dollar, meanwhile, was under pressure after Janet Yellen, head of the San Francisco branch of the Federal Reserve, said Tuesday that the United States 'appears to be in a recession.'Much weaker-than-expected retail sales and other US data did not help and against that backdrop, the yen looked a reasonable bet, dealers said.'As Japan learned in the late 1990s and early 2000s, it takes a few years, not a few months, to solve a credit crunch by disposing of a large amount of non-performing assets,' Barclays analysts wrote.'In addition, we think financial markets will focus on deterioration in the US fiscal position in the process of disposing of non-performing assets, which will be negative for the dollar. Therefore, we expect the yen to continue to appreciate over the medium term,' they said.Analysts at Brown Brothers Harriman made a similar point about the likely pressures on the dollar resulting from the massive bailout plans.'The dollar is lower against most major currencies with markets focusing on the aftermath of the financial rescue package announcements and as officials begin to carry out the package plans.'Additionally, with the global economy softening, some comparison between stimulus plans may also come into focus,' they said.On that basis, the British pound attracted support after London was first to push the idea of taking direct stakes in the banks, a proposal only taken up recently by the United States and Europe.In late trade Wednesday, the euro changed hands at 1.3547 dollars against 1.3618 late Tuesday, 137.79 yen (139.01), 0.7784 pounds (0.7829) and 1.5401 Swiss francs (1.5487).The dollar stood at 101.54 yen (102.07) and 1.1347 Swiss francs (1.1370).The pound was at 1.7443 dollars (1.7394).On the London Bullion Market, the price of gold rose to 847 dollars an ounce at the fixing from 832.50 dollars late on Tuesday.
