HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Hong Kong stocks shot higher in afternoon trading Monday, recouping some of the steep losses from the previous week amid efforts by governments around the world to find a solution to the global financial crisis. The Hang Seng Index surged 1,515.29 points, or 10.2%, to end at 16,312.16, after losing more than 16% in the previous week. The index is still down 41.4% in 2008. Castor Pang, a strategist at Sun Hung Kai Financial, attributed the surge to short-covering, but was skeptical the rally could be sustained. 'Most investors are still cautious and the turnover is still low,' said Pang. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index flared up 13.3% to 8,083.43. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday. Hong Kong stocks jumped in late morning trade after briefly falling into the red, on bargain buying in beaten-down property shares such as Sun Hung Kai Properties as well as Chinese financials like China Construction Bank. 'Basically, the confidence levels are still weak ... The current problem is that counterparty risk [in financial transactions] is very high and it seems there is no real solution in the short-term,' said Peter Pak, vice president at BOCI Research in Hong Kong. The surge in Hong Kong also lifted stocks in Shanghai after they fell sharply in the morning session. The Shanghai Composite Index ended 3.7% up at 2,073.57, after dropping as low as 1,931.47 during the session. Mumbai, Sydney, others Other markets in the region also rebounded, with Mumbai stocks rallying on banks such as ICICI Bank and State Bank of India after a steep reduction in banks' cash reserve requirements by the central bank became effective on Saturday. Last week, the Reserve Bank of India increased a reduction in the cash reserve ratio to 1.5 percentage points to 7.5%, from a half-point cut announced earlier in the month, to ease a liquidity crunch in the money markets. The Sensitive Index, or Sensex, jumped 7.4% to 11,319.93 in afternoon trading. Sydney shares climbed sharply after the government guaranteed deposits in the country's banks, with the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index rising 5.6% to 4,180.70, after tumbling as much as 8.3% Friday. Tony Russell, a senior client adviser at ABN Amro Morgans in Brisbane, said the Australian government's move to guarantee bank deposits gave people comfort. 'It certainly will restore some confidence. But the main issue is getting the liquidity into those credit markets,' said Russell. He added, however, that the markets were likely to 'continue to be very, very volatile' in the near-term. Taiwanese stocks declined as trading resumed after Friday's holiday, although the fall was limited after the government halved the daily limits on stock movements to 3.5%. The Taiex ended 2.2% lower at 5,020.44, with several stocks, including Cathay Financial Holding Co., Chunghwa Telecom Co. (CHT:CHTNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) and Foxconn Technology Co. (FXTCF:FXTCFNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) , dropping by the revised daily limit of 3.5%.
