SINGAPORE -- Commodities fell again on Friday after weak US growth data renewed fears of slumping demand, with raw materials from oil to copper heading for their worst month on record.Oil and copper prices have more than halved since July as the global financial crisis has spurred worries that demand will contract alongside economic growth, and also forced investors to sell once profitable holdings in commodities to cover losses in equities and other investments.Grains fell, gold stayed on course for its biggest monthly fall since 1983 and copper, a key gauge of real economic activity, notched up both its largest weekly rise and its steepest monthly drop, underlining the sector's dramatic swings.The Reuters-Jeffries CRB Index, a global benchmark of 19 commodities, is down around 23 percent in October so far, also set for its largest monthly decline ever.Volatility in the commodities markets is likely to continue into next year, said Alex Passmore, a mining analyst at Patterson Securities in Perth. 'Once credit markets unfreeze and people get used to new, lower asset prices, we should see volatility ease, but we will have to wait for Libor to come down, the US election and even the Chinese new year in the first quarter of next year for that to happen.' The Bank of Japan joined its US and Chinese counterparts, among other central banks, by cutting interest rates to 0.3 percent from 0.5 percent, its first such move in seven years.But the move was less than expected and decided by a split vote, sending the benchmark Nikkei to close down 5.0 percent.Australia, Britain and the euro zone are expected to cut rates next week.Oil dropped more than 2.5 percent to below $65 a barrel after weak US economic data refocused attention on falling demand.US gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 0.3 percent for the third quarter, the sharpest fall in the world's largest oil consumer in seven years, knocking commodities lower across the board.US light crude for December delivery fell $1.67 to $64.29 a barrel by 0700 GMT, adding to Thursday's $1.54 loss that cut short a brief rally earlier in the week. The fuel is now on track for a 35 percent loss this month, its biggest ever. 'Concerns that the weak international economic outlook will depress oil consumption remain a negative for the oil price,' David Moore, commodity strategist for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a daily note.London Metal Exchange copper has fallen 35 percent so far in October and is heading for its biggest monthly drop since at least 1977, despite a 10 percent rise this week.By 0638 GMT copper was down 2.5 percent at $4,095, following a 10 percent fall in the previous session that came on the heels of a 13 percent surge on Wednesday.Chicago Board of Trade soybeans for November delivery fell 0.3 percent to $9.37 per bushel by 0640 GMT. Corn for December delivery lost 1.22 percent to $4.04-1/2, adding to a 2.7 percent drop on Thursday, when a firm dollar and demand worries weighed on prices.December wheat eased 0.05 percent to $5.37- per bushel after shedding 4.1 percent in the previous session.Gold was at $731.45 an ounce, down $4.05 from New York's notional close on Thursday, when it rose for a fourth straight day to its strongest in a week at $776.30 an ounce. Gold has lost as much as 21 percent of its value this month alone, and is down 12 percent this year.
