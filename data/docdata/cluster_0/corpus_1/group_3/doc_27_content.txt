LATEST: US stocks rallied sharply, after the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates and amid signs that the myriad of central bank and government efforts to shore up credit markets were beginning to work.Trading had been volatile after the Fed's big interest- rate cut, the latest in a series of moves to keep the credit crisis from triggering a deep recession. 'Some of the programmes the Fed has been putting in have been helping the market,' said Bobby Harrington, head of block trading at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut.He said the so-called forced selling by hedge funds to raise cash to pay back clients was slowing and that pension funds were buying stocks to rebalance their portfolios. 'There is a window of opportunity here to build off yesterday's rally - things got beaten up pretty bad recently and there are some decent opportunities.' The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 234.16 points, or 2.58 percent, to 9,299.28, after reaching a session high at 9,351.77. The Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 Index climbed 24.09 points, or 2.56 percent, to 964.35, also near its session high at 969.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 46.19 points, or 2.80 percent, to 1,695.66, near its session high of 1,705.51.Earlier, European shares closed more than 7 percent higher on, led by banks and commodity stocks ahead of the US interest rate decisiont.At its close, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 7.51 percent higher at 897.06, closing at its intraday high. 'There are a lot of things to be positive about on the market at the moment, with just a bit of nervousness ahead of the US interest decision mixed in,' said Hank Potts, equity analyst at Barclays Wealth. 'Valuations look cheap, simply too much bad news has been coming down the pipeline lately and the markets appear to have priced in a collapse, which looks too excessive despite the hurdles that many companies face,' Potts added. The index has shed around 41 percent so far this year, amid turmoil across the financial markets that has seen banks broken up or nationalised and left investors fretting about the onset of global recession.Japan may also cut borrowing costs this week, a source with knowledge of the matter said. Tokyo's Nikkei average soared 7.7 percent.European banks were the outstanding gainers, with HBOS leading the sector, up 28.2 percent, follower by Santander up 14 percent, UBS up 15.8 percent, and Standard Chartered adding 30 percent.Oil and gas producers also boosted the market, with BP and Royal Dutch Shell gaining 9.6 and 12 percent, respectively, and Total up 13.6 percent as US crude oil rallied 4.5 percent.Basic resource providers were also strong, as the sector gained 16 percent.Anglo American, Arcelormittal and Salzgitter were some of the sector's best performers, rising between 12 and 20.9 percent.At the other end of European shares, Volkswagen, dove 45 percent as the sharpest faller after its largest shareholder Porsche took steps to ease a squeeze on short-sellers that had more than quadrupled the stock in days and briefly made it the world's most valuable company.The Frankfurt stock exchange, meanwhile, said it would cut the weighting of VW's shares on the blue-chip German DAX index.The prospect of a reweighting gave an additional boost to other German bluechip heavyweights as they stand to benefit from the prospect that index-tracking funds may need to up their holdings to mirror the index's new composition. Siemens, BASF, Daimler, Allianz and E.ON all stand to benefit and they gained between 20 and 23 percent as five of the top six gainers on the Dow Jones Euro STOXX 50 Porsche stock, meanwhile, leapt 38.9 percent after the automaker announced it may sell up to 5 percent of the ordinary shares it holds in VW in order to help settle hedging transactions held by other investors.Looking ahead to tonight's interest rate decision analysts said they expected the Fed to cut rates by half a percentage point.Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 added 8 percent, Germany's DAX was 0.3 percent lower, and France's CAC rose 9.2 percent.
