The Australian dollar was lower at noon as risk aversion continued to hurt the high-yielding currency.At 9am, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.7090/95, down about 1.8 US cents from yesterdays close of $US0.7268/75.During the morning, the local currency traded between a low of $US0.7053 and a high of $US0.7157.The Australian dollar opened at $US0.7053/62 at 4am, down more than two US cents from yesterdays close.But the unit managed to trade near $US0.7100 for most of local trading this morning, as yesterdays aggressive interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia continued to support the currency.They (the RBA) are certainly trying to be very proactive. They can see that there are storm clouds gathering for the Aussie economy, HiFx senior consultant Derek Mumford said.They are trying to get ahead of the curve on that front and give as much support to the domestic economy... which I think is Aussie supportive.But Mr Mumford said risk aversion, which had gripped global markets, meant the best the RBA could do was limit the damage.They are fighting a bit of a losing battle at the moment. I think its only containment, Mr Mumford said.At the moment the Aussie is still very much under pressure.Theres still plenty of risk to the downside.Mr Mumford said currency markets had paid little attention to domestic data today, which showed consumer sentiment fell in October and housing finance weakened further in August.Its very much second place to global considerations, Mr Mumford said of the data.Mr Mumford said he expected the Australian dollar to remain relatively stable for the rest of the local trading session.There could be a test of the $US0.7000 level, however, once European and US markets opened.I do think there could be another challenge if equity markets in the US and Europe are under pressure again, which they quite possibly will be, Mr Mumford said.
