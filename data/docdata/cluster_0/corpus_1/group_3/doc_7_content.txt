World finance chiefs were preparing an emergency meeting in Washington, D.C. as a wave of panic selling swept across markets. Interest rate cuts and billions of dollars worth of cash injections by central banks failed to calm the mayhem. Its very close to panic. We are drowning in a sea of red numbers, said Barclays Wealth analyst Henk Potts. Investors are concerned about the exacerbation of the credit crunch and the gloomy forecasts for economic growth. The reality is that most investors have been spooked by the sheer pressure that the credit crunch is putting on the global economy.

Today looks to be starting off as a complete bloodbath. The FTSE was obliterated on the open, said Capital Spreads Managing Director Simon Denham in London. The markets are going to be absolutely mad throughout the session and hundred-point moves in the indices and currenciesboth up and downare going to be 10 a penny and likely to occur on a moments notice. He also warned investors: Do not bet the house on a turn in the markets. Frankfurts DAX 30 shed more than 10 percent and in Paris the CAC 40 dived 9.68 percent at one stage.
