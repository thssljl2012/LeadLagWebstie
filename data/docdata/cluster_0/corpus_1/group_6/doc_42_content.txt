At the open, London's FTSE 100 index of leading shares rose 0.97 percent to 4,160.88 points. In Paris, the CAC index jumped 2.11 percent to 3,059.21 points and in Frankfurt, the DAX was up 1.36 percent to 4,395.79 points.  Asian stock markets mostly rose as investors welcomed the Bank of America capital boost and hunted for bargains after the previous day's plunge.  Tokyo ended 2.58 percent higher, rebounding from a six-week low, while Seoul gained 2.15 percent and Sydney firmed 0.6 percent.  But dealers said gains were capped by nervousness ahead of corporate earnings results in the United States and Japan that are expected to reflect the rapidly worsening business conditions in recession-hit major economies.
