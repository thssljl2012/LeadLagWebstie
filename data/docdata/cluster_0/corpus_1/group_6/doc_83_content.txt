Despite more evidence of a slowing economy, stock prices were able to post modest gains Friday. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 68.75 points to 8,281.22. The Nasdaq composite index was up 17.49 points to 1,529.33 and the S&amp;P 500 stock index added 6.38 points to 850.12. For the week, the S&amp;P 500 was down 4.5 percent, the Dow dropped 3.7 percent, and the Nasdaq fell 2.7 percent. The financial markets will be closed Monday for celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index fell by 0.7 percent in December, the result of an 8.3 percent decline in energy costs. For all of 2008, the CPI was up by 0.1 percent, the smallest increase in 54 years. Oil prices rebounded Friday, posting a gain of $1.11 to $36.51 a barrel. However, for the week, the price of crude declined another 10 percent. Intel Corp. (NYSE: INTC) helped lead gains after the world's biggest maker of semiconductors said profitability may rebound following the first quarter, when customers finish working through excess supplies. The company said revenue this quarter may be about $7 billion, without providing an official forecast. Intel climbed 45 cents to $13.74. Technology shares in the S&amp;P 500 climbed 1 percent collectively and contributed the most to the market's advance. Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) tumbled $1.14 to $7.18, an 18-year low, after earlier rallying as much as $1 to $9.32. The largest U.S. bank by assets also posted its first loss since 1991 and cut its quarterly dividend to 1 cent a share from 32 cents. '(Friday's) action in the banks and the government's actions to help them is making it clearly evident that what is good for their viability and bondholders will not square with the interests of equity holders at the bottom of the capital structure,' Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak &amp; Co., said in a note to clients. First Horizon National Corp. (NYSE: FHN), Tennessee's biggest bank, climbed 18 percent, the steepest gain in the S&amp;P 500, to $8.82 after it posted a fourth-quarter net loss that was narrower than analysts projected. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) slipped 8.6 percent to $3.50 after earlier climbing to as high as $4.48. The bank posted an $8.29 billion fourth-quarter loss, completing its worst year, as the credit crisis eroded mortgage-bond prices and customers missed more loan payments. Citigroup, which recently said it will sell control of the Smith Barney brokerage to Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), plans to undo the legacy of former CEO Sanford 'Sandy' Weill by splitting into two companies. Citicorp will house the New York- based company's global bank, while Citi Holdings will hold 'non-core' assets, including $301 billion of mortgages, bonds, corporate loans and other assets that the government agreed in November to guarantee. Citigroup extended its loss last week to 48 percent, while Bank of America lost 45 percent. 'Investing in the common stock of a large bank Friday is a fool's game because they can't grow,' said Malcolm Polley, chief investment officer of Stewart Capital Advisors LLC, which manages $1 billion in Indiana, Pennsylvania. 'The game everyone's playing now is: how small will these banks get?' Energy stocks in the S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.2 percent collectively after oil for February delivery rose $1.16, or 3.3 percent, to $36.56 a barrel as traders purchased contracts in an attempt to profit from higher prices in future months. Tesoro Corp. (NYSE: TSO), the largest oil refiner in the U.S. West, led gains among energy stocks, climbing $1.48, or 10 percent, to $15.91. Sunoco Inc. (NYSE: SUN), the largest oil refiner in the U.S. East, increased $2.41, or 6 percent, to $42.31. The gains in stocks Friday came despite economic data that signaled the recession deepened last month. Output at factories, mines and utilities dropped 2 percent last month after a revised decline of 1.3 percent in November that was more than double the previously reported decrease, the Federal Reserve said Friday in Washington. Plant use matched the lowest level since 1983. The 5.8 percent slide in the S&amp;P 500 so far this year suggests the so-called January barometer will signal a loss for 2009. The indicator was developed by Yale Hirsch, chairman and founder of the Stock Traders' Almanac, and built on the theory that the S&amp;P 500's first-month performance sets its course for the year. Since 1950, the barometer has been at least 80 percent accurate. One of the exceptions occurred in 1978, when the index rebounded from a January drop of 6.2 percent to close 1.1 percent higher. The S&amp;P 500 reached an 11-year low of 752.44 and the Dow slid to the lowest since 2003 on Nov. 20. Stocks tumbled as more than $1 trillion in bank losses froze lending and spurred a global recession.
