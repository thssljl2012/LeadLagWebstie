LONDON (SHARECAST) - US stocks rose for a third consecutive day despite gloomy news on consumer confidence, house prices and jobs.   Dow Jones closed up 58 to 8,174, the tech loaded Nasdaq Composite was up 15 at 1,504, while the broader S&amp;P 500 was 9 points better at 845.   A report showing consumer confidence at a record low had prompted selling early on. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index slipped to 37.7 in January from 38.6 last month, worse than expected and the weakest figure since records began in 1967.   It also emerged that house prices in 20 key cities tumbled at their fastest annual pace in November back to 2004 levels, while unemployment leapt in all 50 states in December.   But credit card group American Express managed to post profits, albeit a smaller one, after the close Monday. It said net income fell 79% to $172m, or 15c a share, down from $831m, or 72c a share. That helped its shares jump over 6%.   Chemical firm DuPont fell after reporting a loss of $629m in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $545m a year earlier. Telecom operator Verizon Communications, down 4%, said fourth-quarter earnings rose 15% to $1.24bn on revenue that rose more than 3% to $24.6bn.   Texas Instruments posted a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly profit after last night's close. Elsewhere, Exxon Mobil is weighed down by weaker oil prices. The March futures contract was down $4 at $42 a barrel.   Steel groups were mixed. US Steel's fourth-quarter earnings rose though it warned first quarter revenue would miss forecasts. Steel Dynamics reported better fourth quarter results than expected and said most of its divisions should see profits in 2009. AK Steel shares tumbled after a fourth-quarter loss and warning over the first quarter of 2009.   After hours, Yahoo's underlying earnings beat expectations though it posted a net loss for the fourth quarter of $303m, compared with earnings of $206m. Stripping out one-offs, earnings were $238m, or 17c per share against forecasts of 13c per share. S&amp;P 500 - Risers Convergys Corp.
