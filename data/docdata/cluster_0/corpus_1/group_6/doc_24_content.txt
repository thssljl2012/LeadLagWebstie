HONG KONG, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Asian bond spreads narrowed on  Thursday as Wall Street's gains overnight helped lift sentiment  but the deteriorating economies of China and South Korea  continued to worry investors.  Purchases by the chief executives of Bank of America  and JPMorgan Chase of some of their companies' stock and  Apple's forecast-beating profit helped calm investors,  who had been worried about more bank and other corporate  results. and  Asian shares eked out small gains on Thursday, reflecting a  slight improvement in the appetite for risk.  'There is a bit of confidence toward banks after their  executives bought their shares, and on the corporate side, we  have a stronger-than-expected result from Apple. These factors  gave people a degree of confidence,' said a credit analyst.  The Asia iTraxx investment-grade index  excluding Japan, a key measure of risk aversion, narrowed to  about 328 basis points from as high as 345 on Wednesday, a  trader said.  Credit spreads have widened by as much as 48 basis points in  the previous two sessions, as concerns about more bank failures  and rising fears of a prolonged global recession prompted  investors to flee from riskier assets.  Investors remain on the edge in the coming sessions after  Barclays Capital said that Freddie Mac, the No. 2  provider of home loans in the U.S., would need $26 billion in  fresh aid from the government, traders said.  Elsewhere, South Korea's five-year credit default swaps  (CDS) -- insurance-like contracts that protect  investors against defaults or restructuring -- widened to 381  basis points from as high as 355 on Wednesday on the gloomy  outlook for Asia's fourth-largest economy.  South Korea's economy shrank a seasonally adjusted 5.6  percent in the fourth quarter from the previous three months,  more than twice as much as economists had expected and marked  the second-biggest contraction ever.  With its economy on the brink of a recession, Seoul may be  prompted to introduce more stimulus measures including  additional rate cuts, economists said. The nation's central bank  has lowered rates by a total of 2.75 percentage points since  early October.  China's five-year CDS was steady at 215 basis  points, after Beijing announced the economy expanded at its  slowest pace in seven years in 2008 despite a series of rate  cuts and fiscal measures to support key industries.  China's gross domestic product rose 9.0 percent last year,  snapping five straight years of double-digit growth rates that  fuelled the economy's leap to become the third largest in the  world after the U.S. and Japan.  Asian economies, largely dependent on exports to support  growth, were crumbling as major markets overseas were mired in  recession.
