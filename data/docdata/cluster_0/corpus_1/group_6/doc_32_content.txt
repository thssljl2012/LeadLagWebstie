MELBOURNE: Australian shares reversed losses and rose 0.6 percent on Wednesday, shored up by the banks, while top property stock Westfield Group and building materials group Boral Ltd slid on profit warnings. Banks followed Wall Street higher, despite weak data from the United States showing consumer confidence sank to a record low this month and home prices dropped at a record pace in November.  'It seems like the market's been conditioned to being knocked around for quite some time now, so we're taking bad news in our stride. That's about the only way you could describe it,' said Michael Heffernan, strategist at broker Austock Group. Commonwealth Bank of Australia topped gains among the banks, rising 5.5 percent to A$26.11. BHP Billiton led the miners higher, up 1.7 percent to A$29.84, despite weaker metals and oil prices.  'It's very comforting to see that the resources stocks can bounce up when you get bad news. That would indicate we've been knocked around too much over the past,' said Heffernan. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 index rose 24.8 points to 3,468.8 by 0015 GMT, following Tuesday's 3 percent gain. The deepening U.S. housing slump and weaker Australian sales than expected forced Boral to cut its profit forecast by 40 percent for the year to June 2009, which sent its shares down as much as 20 percent and knocked its peers, too.  The spreading global recession also hit Westfield, the world's biggest shopping mall owner by market value, leading it to warn it would have to cut its dividend by up to 9 percent in calendar 2009. Its shares slid 7.4 percent to a record low of A$11.20. New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index was down 0.3 points at 2,735.5.
