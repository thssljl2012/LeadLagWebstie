(RTTNews) - The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a mixed opening on Thursday. Market mood is likely to continue to remain fragile amid mixed corporate and economic news. Notwithstanding JP Morgan's (JPM   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating) earnings that could instill some confidence that firms can get by with a little more discipline, there have been other companies, which have problems to confess. Apple (AAPL   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating) stalwart Steve Jobs health could weigh on the shares of the company, while the tech space could see muted performance ahead of Intel's (INTC   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating) earnings.  Economic reports released earlier in the day exemplified a lackluster job market, a weak manufacturing sector and slowing inflationary pressures.  U.S. stocks opened Wednesday's session markedly lower after the U.S. Commerce Department released a report on retail sales for December, showing a bigger-than-expected drop in sales. The weakness intensified till late morning trading before the major averages began to stabilize and move sideways for the rest of the session.

On the economic front, retail sales declined for the sixth straight month in December, with sales dropping 2.7% month-over-month. A drop in gasoline sales was responsible for much of the weakness. That said, almost all major categories showed declines for the month. Core retail sales, excluding autos, building materials and gas fell 1.4%, marking the biggest decline since September 2001. To make matters worse, October and November sales were revised downwards.  The Labor Department's import and export prices report revealed a smaller than expected decline in import prices for December. However, non-oil import prices fell a bigger-than-expected 1.1%.  Meanwhile, the Fed's Beige Book showed that all districts reported weaker activity. While holiday sales were reported to be weak, residential and commercial real estate activity was weak across almost all districts. The Beige Book also revealed that vehicle sales were either weak or down in all districts, while manufacturing activity remained weak in almost all districts. Credit conditions continued to remain tight and labor market conditions deteriorated, with most districts reporting pay freezes or reductions in overall compensation.  Business inventories at the end of November were down 0.7% month-over-month, according to a report released by the U.S. Commerce Department.

On the economic front, the Cabinet Office reported shortly before the market opened that core machinery orders in Japan declined by a record 16.2% in November, falling much more than 7.5% decline expected by most economists. In unadjusted terms, November's core machinery orders fell 27.7% from a year earlier.  Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan said that Japan's domestic corporate goods price index was up 1.1% in December.
