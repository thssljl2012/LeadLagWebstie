 (RTTNews) - The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a higher opening on Tuesday, with stocks likely to move back to the upside after ending the previous session in the red. The upward momentum comes ahead of the release of some key economic data. While the data could have a significant impact on trading, some investors are likely to suggest that the data has already been priced into the markets.   U.S. stocks opened Monday's session lower and remained below the unchanged line for the better part of the session. Even amid hopes for a reversal in sentiment, weakness crept in as traders expressed apprehension over calls for a bottom in the economic cycle and the prospects of fourth quarter earnings. The Dow Industrials, which closed at a 2-month high on Friday, remained below the unchanged line throughout the session before closing down 81.80 points or 0.91% at 8,953.

The technology-weighted index ended down 4.18 points or 0.26% at 1,628.

Twenty-two of the thirty Dow components ended in the red, with JP Morgan Chase (JPM   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating) (down 6.70%) and Verizon Communication (VZ   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating) (down 6.24%) leading the slide.

On the other hand, American Express (AXP   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating) climbed 3.21% and Boeing (BA   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating) rose 2.03%, while Home Depot (HD   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating) ended up 2.40%.

The Philadelphia Oil Service Index climbed 3.69%, while the Amex Disk Drive Index and the Amex Computer Hardware Index gained over 1% each.   Despite recent buoyancy witnessed in the market, the primary downtrend that has been in place since late 2007 has not been violated. However, the Dow Industrials has broken above a secondary down trending line seen since August 2008. Additionally, the index has climbed above its 50-day moving average, although it is trading significantly below its 200-day moving average. Overhead resistances are found around 9,331, 9973 and 10,852, while the index has strong support around 8,409 and 7,766.

A year ago, the reading was at 84.   The report also showed that nearly half of those surveyed think the economic situation will be worse in six months. Meanwhile, the flash estimate released by Eurostat showed that the euro area's annual rate of inflation is expected to come in at 1.6%.   U.S. Economic Reports   The Commerce Department is due to release its report on factory goods orders for November at 10 AM ET on Tuesday. Orders for manufactured goods are likely to have decreased 2.6% in the month.   In October, factory goods orders declined 5.1% following a 2.5% decline in September. Durable goods orders were revised down to represent a decline of 6.9% from the earlier reported 6.2% drop. Core capital goods orders were also revised down to show a drop of 5%.   Meanwhile, the durable goods orders report for November released last week showed that orders for goods designed to last for more than 3 years declined a smaller-than-expected 1% to $186.9 billion. Durable goods orders account for the bulk of factory goods orders.   Excluding transportation, durable goods orders increased 1.2% in November.

The key non-defense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft, rose 4.7% in November after a 6.6% slump in the previous month.   The ISM is also scheduled to release the results of its non-manufacturing survey at 10 AM ET on Tuesday. The non-manufacturing index is likely to show a reading of 37 for December.   Activity in the sector contracted notably in November, with the non-manufacturing index dropping 7 points to a record low reading of 37.3 in November.

The pending home sales index declined by 0.7% in October compared to the previous month. However, the decline was not as steep as the 3% drop forecast by economists. The stabilization may have reflected distressed sales of foreclosed homes. Annually, the index was down 1%.
