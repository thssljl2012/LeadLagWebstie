At 1615 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index had firmed 41.4 points, or 1.12 per cent, to 3,735.7, and the broader All Ordinaries index had risen 36.8 points, or 1.01 per cent, to 3,680.4.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index contract was 21 points higher at 3,713 on a volume of 13,763 contracts.  'Banks were weighing on the market,'' Ord Minnett private client adviser Jon Hancock said.  'The only upside were the resources, particularly being propped up by BHP Billiton more so than Rio.''  BHP Billiton added 95 cents or 3.09 per cent to $31.70, while rival Rio Tinto eased seven cents or 0.16 per cent to $43.93.  Australia's major lenders finished mixed, with Commonwealth Bank firming 24 cents or 0.84 per cent to $28.80 and National Australia Bank up 14 cents or 0.67 per cent to $21.00.  But ANZ Banking Group backtracked by two cents or 0.13 per cent to $15.20 while Westpac declined seven cents or 0.42 per cent to $16.50.  Trading volumes are starting to increase although the level of active participants in the market remains low with many retail clients still on holidays, Mr Hancock said.  'Largely there's a lack of direction in the market. There's a perception (that) we'll go for a little bit of a run on the back of the Obama presidential inauguration on January 20.  'But largely, the uncertainty in the market still exists,'' he said.
