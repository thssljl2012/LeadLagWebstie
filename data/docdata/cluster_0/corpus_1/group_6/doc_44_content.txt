HONG KONG, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares are seen lower on Wednesday, heading for their first seven-session losing streak since September 2008, with some Chinese banking shares set to take another beating after the third equity selldown in a major bank this year. A Morgan Stanley report that cut its earnings estimate and target price on index heavyweight HSBC Holdings will weigh on the blue chip index. The U.S. investment bank cut its profit estimate for the UK-based lender by 17 percent for 2008 and 39 percent for 2009 while slashing its target price by 31 percent to HK$52 amid the global recession. The stock ended Tuesday at HK$73. Royal Bank of Scotland sold $2.4 billion worth of shares, its entire holding, in Beijing-controlled Bank of China at a discount of 7.6 percent to the Chinese lender's last trading price, according to a term sheet. 'With the share-overhang risk eased significantly following a sale by RBS, we expect near-term upside for BOC's share price, which has dropped by 23 percent over the past month due to share-overhang concerns,' said Sandra Cai, analyst with Daiwa. But investors are likely to continue exiting other Chinese banking stocks including ICBC on worries that other strategic investors will cash out in the near term. Last week Bank of America reduced its holding in China Construction Bank while Asian tycoon Li Ka-shing sold some shares in BOC. The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 2 percent to close at 13,668.05 on Tuesday on weak economic data from China. STOCKS TO WATCH- * China Railway Construction Corp said on Wednesday that it planned to issue up to 15 billion yuan ($2.2 billion) of medium-term bills in the interbank market to supplement working capital and fund its projects. The bills, with tenors of up to 10 years, may be issued in tranches, the company said, adding that details would be decided later. ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2253 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT LAST PCT CHG NET CHG S&amp;amp;P 500 871.79 0.18% 1.530 USD/JPY 89.39 -0.04% -0.040 10-YR US TSY YLD 2.2974 -- -0.017 SPOT GOLD 820.7 -0.04% -0.350 US CRUDE 37.78 0.00% 0.190 DOW JONES 8448.56 -0.30% -25.41 ------------------------------------------------------------- &gt; Blue chips fall on corporate earnings gloom &gt; Dollar at 1-month high vs euro as ECB move looms &gt; Prices up as stock weakness sustains safety bid &gt; Gold ends tad up but stronger dollar caps gain &gt; Oil settles above $37 on Saudi cuts, cold weather (Reporting by Parvathy Ullatil; Editing by Jonathan Hopfner) (parvathy.ullatil@thomsonreuters.com; +852 2843-6415)) ASIA-PACIFIC STOCK MARKETS: Pan-Asia......
