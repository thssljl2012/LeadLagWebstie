By Viparat Jantraprap BANGKOK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Thai shares jumped more than 1 percent on Wednesday as a bigger-than-expected interest rate cut aimed at reviving a struggling economy helped the main index reverse early session losses. The SET ended the day up 1.3 percent, erasing a 0.6 percent fall before the Bank of Thailand cut its main interest rate by 75 basis points to 2.00 percent, the second hefty cut in two months. Economists said further easing was likely. 'It seems that the central bank will continue to cut rates and we expect to see the key policy rate drop to 1.00 percent in the middle of this year,' Nuchjarin Panarode, an economist at Capital Market Securities, said. The market was also buoyed by investor optimism that government stimulus measures would help boost domestic consumption later this year. Among active stocks, Siam Commercial Bank rose 2.5 percent and Kasikornbank was up 1.1 percent ahead of full-year results next week. Despite the rally in Thailand, analysts said the appetite for equities was limited by the impact of the global economic slowdown on corporate profits. In Indonesia, the main index hit a more than 1-week low as bank shares slumped on a poor outlook for loan growth. The index ended 0.92 percent lower, after earlier falling as much as 1.2 percent to its lowest since Jan. 5. Top lender PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia slid 1 percent and Bank Mandiri was off 3.9 percent. 'Bad news will keep equities markets moving downward. Poor quarterly results later this month will be one selling trigger,' said Viwat Techapoonphol, a strategist at Tisco Securities. Other major Southeast Asian stocks ended mixed, with Singapore shares inching up 0.16 percent, Malaysian shares drifting down 0.03 percent and Philippines stocks closing 0.56 percent lower. Singapore's banks were mixed, with DBS Group up 1.7 percent and United Overseas Bank 1.45 percent higher. Jurong Technologies shares dropped by more than half after it said Oversea-Chinese Banking had demanded repayment of loans to be made in three weeks. In Malaysia, worries were mounting for the domestic economy, which Citibank said might tip into recession in the last quarter of 2008 and first quarter of this year. Among Malaysian shares, Bumiputra-Commerce led decliners with a 3.6 percent fall. Gainers were led by plantation firm IOI Corp, up 0.53 percent in response to a rise in Malaysian palm oil futures.
