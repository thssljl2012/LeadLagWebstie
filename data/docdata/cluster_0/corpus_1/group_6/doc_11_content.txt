Financial companies led the S&amp;P 500 to a fourth day of gains Wednesday as President Barack Obama prepared to set up a so-called bad bank to absorb toxic investments. The index, which has dropped for three straight weeks, is still 12 percent above an 11-year low reached on Nov. 20 amid optimism that Obama's stimulus package will revive the economy. The 'bad bank' proposal will not spur lending, Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst Meredith Whitney said in a note Thursday. The banks likely will not participate in selling assets to a 'bad bank' if the Obama administration wants to pay fair market value for the assets 'as capital hits would be too dear,' Whitney said. Allstate Corp. (NYSE: ALL) dropped $6.14 to $23.50. The largest publicly traded U.S. home and auto insurer said it will cut 1,000 jobs after the falling value of investments caused the company to lose $1.68 billion last year. The loss raised concern Allstate may end its 14-year streak of boosting its dividend. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) and Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) fell 7.1 percent and 8.3 percent respectively and financial shares posted the steepest declines among the 10 main industries in the S&amp;P 500.

'It's like watching a slow car crash,' said Kully Samra, U.S. equity markets analyst at Charles Schwab U.K. Ltd. in London. 'Earnings are still a concern.' The slide in the S&amp;P 500 so far this year suggests the so- called January barometer will signal a loss for 2009. The indicator was developed by Yale Hirsch, chairman and founder of the Stock Traders' Almanac, and built on the theory that the S&amp;P 500's first-month performance sets its course for the year. Since 1950, the barometer has been at least 80 percent accurate. One of the exceptions occurred in 1978, when the index rebounded from a January drop of 6.2 percent to close 1.1 percent higher.
