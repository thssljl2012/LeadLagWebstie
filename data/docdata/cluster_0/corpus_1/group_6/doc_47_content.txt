LONDON (ShareCast) - The unveiling of a government rescue package for Bank of America revived appetite for riskier currencies Friday, sending the dollar lower against the euro and pound.   The dollar, viewed as a relatively safe asset, was sold in favour of higher yielding, riskier currencies such as the euro.   Gains on Wall Street and fresh wave of optimism about an economic recovery was helped by the release Thursday by the House Democrats of a massive economic recovery plan, aimed at soothing the economic crisis.   Also boosting sentiment was the US Treasury's announcement that it would inject $20bn into Bank of America as its tries to digest its Merrill Lynch acquisition.   The greenback was further weighed down as traders digested a mixed bag of economic news. A Labor Department report showed that US consumer prices increased by 0.1% in 2008, its smallest rise in over 50 years while a separate report showed consumer confidence in January unexpectedly rose.   The Japanese yen was lower against major currencies as traders switched to riskier assets.   Sterling surged, shrugging off a seven day losing streak, as investors sought riskier assets.   The UK currency was largely unaffected by poor economic data. A report showed business confidence has plunged to its lowest in 16 years and more than half of companies predict a fall in profit during the first half of 2009.
