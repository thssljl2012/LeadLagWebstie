Yet investors were also heartened by plans for both banks to restore themselves to profitability, and they were also willing to place bets on a range of consumer and industrial stocks.  The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.8 per cent to 8281.22, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 0.8 per cent to 850.12, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.2 per cent to 1529.33. For the week, the Dow fell 3.7 per cent, the S&amp;P 500 lost 4.5 per cent and the Nasdaq skidded 2.7 per cent. - NZPA
