The Australian share market is marginally higher at midday, after opening lower on a negative lead from Wall St amid worries about corporate profits, and with local data showing housing finance rose better-than-expected in November.   At 1205 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 had lifted 0.21 per cent to 3,662.30, and the All Ordinaries was up 0.18 per cent at 3,600.50. BHP Billiton remained in positive territory up 0.52 per cent at $30.59, but down from its high of $30.97, while rival Rio Tinto added to this morning's losses, falling 1.61 per cent to $39.70.   The country's third biggest iron ore miner, Fortescue Metals Group, lifted 2.59 per cent to $1.975.   The energy sector continued to build on early gains after oil rose 19 US cents to $US37.78 a barrel. Woodside Petroleum rose 2.35 per cent to $35.59 and Santos increased 2.03 per cent to $14.06, while Oil Search bucked the trend, falling 2.48 per cent to $4.31.   The banks were mixed by midday after showing earlier strength, with National Australia Bank rising 0.93 per cent to $20.54, ANZ Banking Group up 1.01 per cent to $15, but Westpac Banking Corporation falling 0.18 per cent to $16.52, and Commonwealth Bank of Australia losing 0.42 per cent to $28.27. CBA announced it had added $350 million to its issue of government-backed fixed rate notes due in 2013 and sold in December.   Wesfarmers, the owner of Coles supermarkets, dropped 3.65 per cent to $16.85, as the company signalled it might have to cut its dividend and forecast a first half net profit of between $850 million and $880 million. Rival retailer, Woolworths, rose 0.15 per cent to $26.40.   Australia's only oil refiner and marketer Caltex Australia outperformed the market, surging 6.68 per cent to $7.98 at midday after an earlier high of $8.22, after announcing its profit in 2008 had beat its previous forecast by as much as 37 per cent. Caltex Australia posted an unaudited operating profit for the year of $185 million, stripping out oil price volatility, exceeding its forecast range of $135 to $155 million given last month.   A better-than-expected result from housing finance data for November indicated some confidence had returned to the market.   The number of financed dwelling commitments rose 1.3 per cent to 49.192, seasonally adjusted, according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).   The local market closed lower on Tuesday, weighed upon by a weaker resources sector. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 28.7 points, or 0.78 per cent, at 3,654.6 and the broader All Ordinaries index lost 30.1 points, or 0.83 per cent, to 3,593.9.
