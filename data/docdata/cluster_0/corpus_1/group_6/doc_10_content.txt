* Beijing-controlled Bank of China rose 3.2 percent after Royal Bank of Scotland sold $2.4 billion worth of shares, its entire holding in China's No.2 lender. The deal was sealed at the top-end of a price range at HK$1.71 per share, a discount of 7.6 percent to the Chinese lender's last trading price. Other Chinese lenders also rose, bouncing back from a sharp correction last week triggered by worries over equity selldowns by strategic investors, as U.S. and European investors hit hard by the global credit crises look to shore up their books. ICBC rose 1.2 percent while China Construction Bank gained 4.3 percent. Bank of Communications added 5.1 percent. Last week, Bank of America reduced its holding in CCB while Asian tycoon Li Ka-shing sold some shares in Bank of China.  * Chinese real estate stocks gained amid talk that Beijing was set to announce further steps to rescue the country's ailing property sector. China may announce measures including cash support for developers who build small-unit apartments, the housing minister was cited as saying in a newspaper report on Tuesday. China Overseas Land gained 5.5 percent while Shimao Property climbed 1.9 percent.  * Athletic footwear-maker Yue Yuen Industrial rose 4.2 percent despite missing the forecast on its year-end profit as investors cheered its better-than-expected profit margin in the final quarter. Yue Yuen posted a 30 percent increase in its net profit for the year ended Sept. 2008 at $468.66 million, but the figure came in 10 percent below Citigroup's estimate. But profit margin in the fourth quarter rose 1.6 percentage points to 24.4 percent from the previous three-month period, beating expectations, Citi said in a report. The company which supplies sports shoes to firms such as Nike and Adidas said it expects moderate growth in 2009 amid lower costs.
