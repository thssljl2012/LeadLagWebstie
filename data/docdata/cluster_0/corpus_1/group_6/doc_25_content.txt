The rise in financials offset losses in materials and energy, which both fell hard on lower oil and gold prices. The S&amp;P/TSX composite index saw an increase to 8759.63, up 103.12 points, or 1.19 per cent. The TSX Venture was also boosted, closing at 867.87, up 0.71 points, or 0.08 per cent. The Canadian dollar, meanwhile, fell 14 basis points to 81.55 cents US. 'The winners were the financial-services stocks for the second day in a row,' said David Baskin, president of Baskin Financial Services Inc. 'It was a bifurcated market (Tuesday) " commodities lousy, financials good.' Strong gains from banks buoyed financials, pushing the group up 3.76 per cent for the day. Bank of Nova Scotia closed up 1.61 points at $29.60, a 5.75 per cent increase. Royal Bank rose almost four per cent, while Manulife Financial jumped 6.05 per cent.  The losers for the day were energy and materials. Oil plummeted $4.15 to $41.58 US a barrel amid continuing worries about slumping demand and poor U.S. economic data. Gold also tumbled, ending the day at $901.40 US an ounce for the most-active April futures contract, down $9.30.  Resource companies, which make up 40 per cent of the TSX, saw their shares weighed down by gold and oil's decline. Shares in Suncor Energy Inc. fell 1.57 per cent, or 38 cents, to $23.90. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. also experienced a decline, closing the day at $93.60, down 0.58 per cent, or 55 cents.  Baskin said whatever effect the Conservative government's budget " released after the markets closed Tuesday " had on the markets was already priced in after several elements were revealed earlier in the week. 'I think it won't be of very much consequence to tell you the truth. I think so much has been released ahead of time and widely discussed in the press, that unless there's s a wild card, I can't see it having a very big impact,' he said. In the U.S., markets also rose overall after a strong rally in bank stocks, despite dismal housing and consumer confidence data. Stronger-than-expected earnings from Texas Instruments Inc. and American Express Co added to the mood.  The Dow Jones industrial average saw a small increase of 58.7 points, or 0.72 per cent, closing at 8,174.73, while the S&amp;P 500 jumped 9.14 points, or 1.09 per cent, to 845.71. The Nasdaq composite index was also up. It closed the day at 1,504.90, gaining 15.44 points, or 1.04 per cent. 'I think everyday that the U.S. banks survive without being nationalized or writing off a few billion dollars or having any terrible news is another good day,' said Baskin. Citigroup Inc. closed up 6.61 per cent, 22 cents, to $3.55 US, while the Bank of America recorded a rise of 8.33 per cent, ending the day at $6.50, up 50 cents.
