US stocks swung higher in a volatile session to end the week after a US government rescue injection of $US20 billion ($30 billion) into Bank of America provided some confidence for markets.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 59.41 points or 0.72 per cent to 8271.90 at the closing bell after a wobbly session that saw the market alternate between gains and losses.   The Nasdaq composite advanced 16.48 points or 1.09 per cent to 1528.32 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 broad-market index added 5.42 points or 0.64 per cent to a preliminary close of 849.16.   Market action came amid intense focus on the banking sector after the US government extended a new lifeline to Bank of America, injecting another $US20 billion ($30 billion) in capital and guaranteeing $US118 billion ($177 billion) in shaky assets to help it weather the ongoing financial crisis.   Although Bank of America shares led the financial sector lower, the rest of the market steadied.   Al Goldman at Wachovia Securities said that 'the market was oversold and ready for a rally' after a rocky start to 2009.   Additionally, he said there was a better mood about the change at the White House as Barack Obama was set for inauguration next week to replace President George W Bush. 'No matter how one feels about President Bush, most Americans are pleased to see him go and Obama to arrive. This could provide an emotional uplift,' Mr Goldman said.
