Global resources giant BHP Billiton propped up the Australian share market on Friday, tipping it into positive territory amid weakness among financials.  At 2.15pm, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index had firmed 41.4 points, or 1.12 per cent, to 3735.7, and the broader All Ordinaries index had risen 36.8 points, or 1.01 per cent, to 3680.4.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index contract was 21 points higher at 3713 on a volume of 13,763 contracts.  Banks were weighing on the market, Ord Minnett private client adviser Jon Hancock said.  The only upside were the resources, particularly being propped up by BHP Billiton more so than Rio.  BHP Billiton added 95 cents or 3.09 per cent to $31.70, while rival Rio Tinto eased seven cents or 0.16 per cent to $43.93.  Australia's major lenders finished mixed, with Commonwealth Bank firming 24 cents or 0.84 per cent to $28.80 and National Australia Bank up 14 cents or 0.67 per cent to $21.  But ANZ backtracked by two cents or 0.13 per cent to $15.20 while Westpac declined seven cents or 0.42 per cent to $16.50.  Trading volumes are starting to increase although the level of active participants in the market remains low with many retail clients still on holidays, Mr Hancock said.  Largely there's a lack of direction in the market. There's a perception (that) we'll go for a little bit of a run on the back of the Obama presidential inauguration on January 20.  But largely, the uncertainty in the market still exists, he said.  By 2.24pm, diversified financials mostly were stronger with the notable exception of Macquarie Bank.  Australia's largest investment bank finished $1.12 or 3.45 per cent lower at $31.38 after Thursday's market update which saw the bank declare the December quarter had been exceptionally challenging.  Gold stocks were the bourse's clear bright spot, with Lihir Gold surging by 29 cents or 11.79 per cent to $2.75, Newcrest Mining jumping $2.30 or 8.11 per cent to $30.65 and Newmont Mining up 36 cents or 7.26 per cent to $5.32.  At 2.24pm, the spot price of gold in Sydney was $US855.55 per fine ounce, up $US9 on Thursdays close of $US846.55.  Major retailers also gained ground, with Woolworths 21 cents or 0.81 per cent firmer at $26.23, Wesfarmers Ltd - owner of Coles supermarket chain - adding 27 cents or 1.45 per cent to $18.95, and upmarket department store David Jones adding one cent or 0.33 per cent to $3.06.  Harvey Norman was ten cents lower, or by 3.94 per cent, at $2.44.
