MELBOURNE - The Australian stock market closed higher on Wednesday, after the local resources sector strengthened on the back of improved commodity prices.  At the 1615 AEDT close, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was up 37.0 points, or 0.99 per cent, at 3,779.7, and the broader All Ordinaries index added 39.0 points, or 1.06 per cent, to 3,728.2.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was 41 points higher at 3,757 on a volume of 17,650 contracts.  ABN AMRO Morgans private client adviser Craig Walker said the resources sector had been boosted by some recovery in prices for base metals. 'I just think that people have just come to the realisation that they (resources stocks) have been overdone (oversold),' Mr Walker said. Investors were also hunting for bargains. 'I think we're just seeing a bit of a recovery of sorts. 'People are getting stuck into some of the blue-chips given they have taken such a hiding.' He said the market appeared to be stabilising. 'A lot of people are starting to become increasingly confident that the low in the market may well have passed, and people are starting to focus on some of the positive things out there.'
