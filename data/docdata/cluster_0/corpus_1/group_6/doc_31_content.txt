Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  THE share market was marginally higher this morning, with the market relieved housing finance data for November had met expectations.  At 12.00pm (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was up 7.8 points, or 0.21 per cent, at 3662.4, and the broader All Ordinaries index had gained 6.9 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 3600.8.  Patersons Securities associate director John Curtin said trading was very quiet.  'There was an increase of just under 1.5 per cent in housing finance from October to November, with the market looking for 1.5 per cent,'' Mr Curtin said.  'That was seen as not worse than expected, which allowed our market to claw back.''  Australian housing finance commitments for owner-occupied housing rose 1.3 per cent in November, seasonally adjusted, to 49,192, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said.  By 12.15pm banking stocks were mostly higher with the exception of Commonwealth Bank which eased five cents or 0.18 per cent to $28.34.  NAB firmed 1.23 per cent to $20.60, ANZ added 15 cents to $15.00 and Westpac put on 1 cent to $16.56.  Diversified financial stocks made gains with AXA Asia Pacific Holdings up 6 cents to $5.06, Insurance Australia Group adding 6 cents to $3.93 and QBE Insurance Group advancing 19 cents to $25.72.  The resources sector was mixed.  Rio Tinto lost 1.34 per cent to $39.81, while BHP Billiton added 14 cents to $30.57.  Gold stocks were also confused.  Newcrest Mining lost 2.22 per cent to $30.78, Lihir Gold was 1 cent weaker at $2.67, while Newmont Mining added 9 cents to $5.34.  The price of gold in Sydney was $US821.55 per fine ounce, down $US1.10 on Tuesday's close of $US822.65.  In other news, Wesfarmers lost ground, down 3.49 per cent to $16.88, after the company said it expects first half 2008/09 net profit to be between $850 million and $880 million.  This was after about $150 million in pre-tax provisions and write-downs in the value of some investments.  'That has disappointed the market and raised fear that they may not be able to pay the full year dividend of $2 per share previously forecast,'' Mr Curtin said.  'The fear was that it may lead to a profit warning coming through.  'Also, they weren't able to give any guidance on their debt refinancing because it hadn't been done as yet.''  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index contract was 13 points higher at 3636 on a volume of 8238 deals.
