 DIA / GLD / JPM / OIL / QQQQ / SPY / XLE  Bill Cara  About this author:  Profile  &amp; More Articles  Visit: BillCara.com  Font Size:  Print  Email  [Excerpted from Bill Cara's Daily Report]  Despite more selling of the shares of the Bank of America (BAC -13.7%), Citigroup (C -8.6%) and JP Morgan (JPM -6.2%), Friday was clearly the start of the Obama Inauguration Rally, with all sectors, except Financials (XLF -3.0%) and all major industries, except Banks ($BKX -4.3%), in rally mode. Following the Citigroup announcement of a quarterly loss of -$8.3 billion, the major US equity indexes sold off after a huge start, but then turned from negative to positive and clawed their way back to gains on the day.  The same thing happened on Thursday, where the major market indexes in NY sank for the first three and a half hours, and then rallied for the final three and a half hours.  By the end of the day Friday, the DJIA (+68.73 +0.84% to 8281.22), S&amp;P 500 (+6.38 +0.76% to 850.12) and NASDAQ Composite (+17.49 +1.16% to 1529.33) all enjoyed higher volume again, and once again it was notable that most of the cash flow increase was in rallying stocks.  The Dow Jones World Equity Index ($DJW) rallied on Friday by a very strong +1.6%, with every major country market trading higher. The Asia-Pacific equity markets were led by: Tokyo (+2.58% to 8230.2), Australia (+0.52% to 3494.9), Shanghai (+1.78% to 1954.4), Hong Kong (+0.09% to 13255.5), and India (+3.06% to 9323.6). The European bourses were also stronger than Thursday: French CAC (+0.81% to 3020.3); German DAX (+0.78% to 4370.5); and UK FTSE (+0.75% to 4151.9). The gains there would have been higher had these exchanges been able to capture the later gains in NY and Toronto. The Toronto Composite gained +40.79 +0.46% to 8920.4 (following Thursdays gain of +2.20%), and on Friday the Venture Board was up +21.35 +2.53% to 865.65.  The Big Three US Banks took an average loss on Friday of -9.3%, which is just incredible as it follows a week of flat-out selling. This week alone, BAC -44.7%, C -48.2% and JPM -12.1%, were down an average -35.0%. Therein lays the anchor that is holding back the Good Ship America, giving traders a sinking feeling, taking their eyes off the rising tide.  In the industry groups, Goldminers ($XAU +4.7%) were the leaders, with the third strong gain in the past four days.  In the Cara 100, there were many winners, and the volume was impressive once again: Silver Wheaton (SLW +11.2%) soared due to the rally in silver prices to $11.26/oz; Best Buy (BBY +8.1%) on +201% average daily volume; Kinross Gold (KGC +7.3%), SanDisk (SNDK +6.4%); and Goldcorp (GG +5.7%). The losers were Russias telecom service giants Mobile TeleSystems (MBT -7.9%) and Vimpel (VIP -7.7%); Deutsche Bank (DB -4.8%); and Brunswick Corp (BC -3.7%).  The $USD slipped ($USD -0.60% to 83.97 from 84.48), while the Euro jumped ($XEU +1.13% from 131.25 to 132.73). The Yen sank a further -0.99% to 110.20, after being down -1.08% on Thursday, as traders have been easing up on their risk aversion late in the week. The Pound gained (+0.63% to 147.43) for the third straight session after being trounced on Monday and Tuesday. The Cdn Loonie recovered from the 70s on Thursday with a solid gain of +0.98% to close the week at 80.53.  The US long bond ($USB), which had hit a peak of about 138 the previous day, sold down Friday to a close of 136.22 (-0.67% on the day). The yields on the 30-, 10-, and 5-year Treasury bonds and notes closed Friday at 2.894, 2.304, and 1.451 percent respectively. T-Bill yields are at 0.115 percent, which is the highest all week.  Crude Oil futures again closed down (-$0.97/bbl) to 42.57, which was the third straight day of losses, albeit small ones. Notable is that the stocks (XLE +0.80%) were up a second straight day. However, the earlier losses took XLE down -4.3% W/W.  More notable is the relative performance of the XLE (stocks) against the USO (oil contracts) since early October. This performance chart shows major buying of the oil stocks in the past 13 or 14 weeks.  Gold futures ($GOLD) rocketed +$32.60/oz (+4.04%) to close at 839.90 yesterday, but $SILVER (+7.42%) was even stronger, which is expected in a precious metals rally. During the Bear phase for the Precious Metals, silver was the leader on the downside, and now it has started to lead the Bull higher.  http://stockcharts.com/charts/performance/perf.html?$GOLD,$SILVER  On Friday, the spot gold, palladium, platinum and silver closed the week higher at: 842.03 (close to Fridays high of 843.13); 183; 946; and 11.26, respectively.  The DJIA futures at the close of the week were 8243, down a tad from the DJIA index which closed at 8281.22.
