World oil prices were mixed in Asian trade yesterday after staging a late rally the previous day.  New York's main futures contract, light sweet crude for March delivery, was down US$0.81 to US$42.86 a barrel in afternoon trade.  Brent North Sea crude for March delivery was up US$0.01 to US$45.40.  Mark Pervan, senior commodities analyst at ANZ bank in Melbourne, said the slight rally on Thursday was a technical rebound and not indicative of the current market.  'It's a technical factor... just the market crossing into a new month,' Pervan said.  He was referring to the transition to New York's March contract from the February contract, which expired Tuesday.  Pervan added that the market was still bogged down by weak energy demand. He pointed to the U.S. announcement of a significant increase in crude reserves as testament to a continuing weak global appetite for oil.
