MELBOURNE, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Australian stocks rose 1.1  percent on Friday, led by a rebound in mining stocks and hopes  for another hefty interest rate cut in Australia next month after  the Bank of England slashed its rates to a record low.  Gold stocks in particular found favour, with Newcrest Mining jumping 8 percent to A$30.65 and Lihir Gold up  12 percent to A$2.75, after bullion prices rose nearly 2 percent  in U.S. trade on Thursday.  Overall, the market posted a 0.6 percent gain for the week.  'We're actually up in the first trading week in January so  that's a very good harbinger for the year,' said Michael  Heffernan, senior client adviser and strategist at Austock group.  'With all the artillery that's getting thrown at the economy,  sooner or later it's got to have a positive effect and the market  always anticipates that,' he said.  Australia's benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index rose 41.4  points to 3,735.7, according to the latest available data.  Volumes were low at around A$2.36 billion ($1.7 billion) for  the day as investors awaited U.S. jobs data later on Friday,  which is expected to make gloomy reading.  Forecasts centre on a rise in unemployment to 7 percent in  December, which could be a setback for Wall Street.  'Volumes have been pretty weak. We're at least a third down  on last year,' said Heffernan.  Still, hopes Australia's central bank would continue to lower  borrowing costs when it next meets in early February lent support  to the local market.  Australian interest rates have already been lowered 3  percentage points to 4.25 percent and markets are pricing a  further 125 basis points of cuts by March.  'People are saying that we will probably get another 50 to  100 (basis) point cut in February,' said Rick Klusman, dealer at  Aequs Securities.  Banks were mixed, with Commonwealth Bank up 0.8  percent to A$28.80 but Westpac Banking Corp. down 0.4  percent at A$16.50.  Miner BHP Billiton Ltd rose 3.1 percent to A$31.70,  recouping some of Thursday's 5.7 percent loss.  'Maybe there's a view that BHP has been belted down far too  much, and BHP has a lot of cash in the drawer, so maybe it's been  hit more than necessary and hence we're seeing a good resurgence  there,' said Heffernan.  Alumina Ltd shares rose 4 percent to A$1.64. The  company announced Judith Downes will replace Ken Dean as Chief  Financial Officer from Monday.  New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index was flat at  2,757.4.
