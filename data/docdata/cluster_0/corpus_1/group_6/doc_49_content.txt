NEW YORK -- IBM gave Wall Street a reprieve from bad news today and investors responded by giving stocks a big rebound from their Inauguration Day plunge.  The Dow Jones industrials surged more than 220 points as gains by technology stocks and a partial recovery in financial shares pulled the market sharply higher. All the major indexes rose more than 2 percent after earnings reports and forecasts from PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and Bank of New York Mellon eased concerns that the troubles at financial giants like Citigroup Inc. were hitting all banks.  Some bounce would have been expected following Tuesday's sell-off that took the Dow down 332 points. But a better-than-expected 2009 forecast from IBM Corp. left technology shares looking like relatively safe bargains. Energy stocks also advanced as oil prices gained.  IBM said late Tuesday it expects its earnings for the new year to come in well above what analysts had been expecting and that its fourth-quarter profit jumped 12 percent, easily topping analysts' estimates. Swedish wireless equipment maker LM Ericsson also reported earnings that beat forecasts.  Banks reversed double-digit drops from Tuesday with double-digit gains. PNC, which acquired National City Corp. on Dec. 31, jumped 30 percent after posting a loss for the fourth quarter but said it would turn in a profit for 2008. And Bank of New York Mellon Corp. rose 16 percent after reporting that it managed to eke out a profit for the fourth quarter.  Not all industries shared in the day's advance. Airlines were weak after American Airlines and United Airlines posted lackluster results. Typical safe-havens for weak economies, like utilities and makers of consumer staples, fell as investors shifted money into harder-hit areas to look for deals.  Earnings reports commanded the market's focus Wednesday and will do so for the next few weeks. Apple Inc. is set to report its fiscal first-quarter results after the market closes.  Kim Caughey, equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, said the results from IBM and some of the banks made clear that while it's a difficult time for businesses, not all are struggling as much as some financial companies. 'It was a great reminder that businesses still have their lights on, their doors open and that they're making money,' she said. Beyond earnings, investors are looking for insights into what steps the new administration will take to shore up the economy. President Barack Obama's Treasury Secretary nominee, Timothy Geithner, asked Congress to act quickly and forcefully to deal with financial crisis. Appearing before the Senate for his confirmation hearing, he said Obama is working to foster economic recovery and 'get credit flowing again.' In late afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 216.48, or 2.72 percent, to 8,165.57.  Broader stock indicators also gained. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index advanced 22.82, or 2.83 percent, to 828.04, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 40.54, or 2.81 percent, to 1,481.40.  The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 13.49, or 3.11 percent, to 447.14. Investors often turn to small-cap stocks when placing bets on a market recovery.  Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.05 billion shares.  Bond prices slumped as stocks rebounded. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, rose to 2.52 percent from 2.37 percent late Tuesday. The yield on the three-month T-bill, in demand because it is considered one of the safest investments, rose to 0.12 percent from 0.10 percent late Tuesday. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices fell.  Light, sweet crude rose $2.71 to settle at $43.55 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Stocks fell sharply Tuesday on worries governments would be forced to take over wobbly banks to avoid their collapse. The Dow dropped lost 332 points, or 4 percent. It was the first time the blue chips closed below 8,000 since November.  The Royal Bank of Scotland alarmed investors around the world this week with the warning its 2008 loss might top $41 billion. That spurred the British government to announce a fresh banking bailout. In the U.S., State Street Corp. -- seen as one of the safer financial firms during the current turmoil because it is a custodial bank -- lost more than half its value Tuesday after reporting its profits plunged and issuing a bleak forecast for 2009.  Citigroup and Bank of America Corp., which at the end of last week reported multibillion dollar fourth-quarter losses, each plunged by more than 20 percent on Tuesday.  The slide in financial stocks came as investors factored in the possibility of insolvency, said Rob Lutts, president and chief investment officer of Cabot Money Management. Investors have also been pricing in expected capital infusions that will lower the value of the common stock that shareholders own.  Lutts said even banks that had been seen as relatively stronger, such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co., are facing large write-downs on investments that will require more capital.  Among bank stocks, PNC jumped $6.49, or 30 percent, to $28.49, while Bank of New York Mellon rose $3.07, or 16 percent, to $21.83.  Citigroup rose 62 cents, or 22 percent, to $3.42, and Bank of America rose $1.31, or 25 percent, to $6.41. Royal Bank of Scotland advanced 38 cents, or 11 percent, to $3.71, and State Street rose $2.24, or 15 percent, to $17.13.  JPMorgan rose $3.34, or 18 percent, to $21.43, and Wells Fargo advanced $1.42, or 10 percent, to $15.65.  Tech shares outpaced much of the broader market Wednesday. IBM jumped $9.21, or 11 percent, to $91.19. Apple rose $3.50, or 4.5 percent, to $81.70.  American Airlines' parent AMR Corp. tumbled $2.71, or 26 percent, to $7.75, while UAL Corp.'s United Airlines slipped 22 cents to $49.14.  Energy stocks rose. Occidental Petroleum advanced $3.84, or 7.6 percent, to $54.72.  Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.04 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 0.77 percent, Germany's DAX index rose 0.50 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.67 percent.
