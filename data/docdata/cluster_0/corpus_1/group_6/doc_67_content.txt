NEW YORK -- The stock market has managed another comeback, rebounding from early losses for the second straight day and posting a moderate advance. Investors spent the session tussling with concerns about the ongoing turmoil in the banking industry and its impact on the economy. But they also were willing to place bets on a range of consumer and industrial stocks.  Many financial stocks are down in response to rising losses at Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. But investors were also heartened by plans by Citigroup and Bank of America aimed at restoring them to profitability.   The Dow Jones industrials are up 68 at 8,281 after falling more than 100 points earlier in the session. Broader indicators also closed higher.   By STEPHEN BERNARD, AP Business Writer
