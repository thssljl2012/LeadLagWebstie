TOKYO, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Japan's Nikkei stock average edged 0.6 percent higher on Wednesday as Tokyo Electron and other chip-related shares climbed after a rival filed for insolvency and after a U.S. stimulus plan was expanded. Banks extended gains made the previous day when the government said it would use public funds to support non-financial firms, reducing the risk of bad loans. They were also boosted by advances made by U.S. bank shares.  A rise in U.S. stock futures after a key U.S. Senate panel expanded an economic stimulus package to about $887 billion on Tuesday also helped lift sentiment.  Dow Jones futures gained 1.5 percent and S&amp;P futures rose 2 percent, pointing to a higher open on Wall Street. 'This may help boost the Nikkei average to near its 25-day moving average, though caution ahead of earnings could prevail,' said Hiroaki Kuramochi, chief equity marketing officer at Tokai Tokyo Securities.  But Nomura Holdings, Japan's largest brokerage, fell after posting a record $3.8 billion quarterly loss, hit by the cost of integrating Lehman Brothers' operations, soured trades and its exposure to Iceland and Bernard Madoff.  The Nikkei gained 45.22 points to 8,106.29 in very choppy trade, extending gains made during a 4.9 percent rally on Tuesday.  The broader Topix slipped 0.1 percent to 804.33.   CHIP SHARES SURGE  Tokyo chip firms joined Asian peers in climbing on hopes that the sector's chronic supply glut would ease after German rival Qimonda filed for insolvency.  Tokyo Electron surged 7.9 percent to 3,430 yen, becoming the biggest contributor to the Nikkei 225 by volume weight. It was followed closely by Advantest Corp which rose 5 percent to 1,251 yen, while Elpida Memory surged 9.1 percent to 609 yen.  Some market players said many chip-related shares may have also been bought up on bargain-hunting. 'When the economy bottoms out, chip-related shares are often among those which are the fastest to turn around, so some investors are likely snapping up the shares today as bargains even though it's still too early to say we're on a rising trend,' said Norihito Fujito, a general manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan's largest bank, rose 1.2 percent to 503 yen, while No.2 bank Mizuho Financial Group gained 1.3 percent to 233 yen and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group climbed 1.2 percent to 3,360 yen.  Nomura fell 2.2 percent to 625 yen.  Trade was moderate on the Tokyo exchange's first section, with 1.90 billion shares changing hands, compared with last week's daily average of 1.77 billion.  Declining stocks outpaced advancing ones, 812 to 755.
