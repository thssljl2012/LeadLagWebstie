Stocks on the move Real-time Equity news U.S. stock market report 1325 ET 29Jan2009-Merrill Lynch: Protectionism becoming more popular ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Merrill Lynch on Thursday said that trends toward protectionism were increasing, gaining strength 'much faster than we thought even just a few weeks ago.' The firm noted that many governments, including the U.S.'s and Japan's, were using public funds in order to inject capital into major companies, and that the U.S. stimulus plan contained 'buy American' provisions. 'While the knee-jerk reaction might be that prices will increase, it is hard to believe that non-U.S. manufacturers will be raising prices in light of these provisions. Margins will be under pressure around the world, as firms fight for the remaining market share.' The firm added that where they were shortages of goods, 'protectionism can be very inflationary.'
