HONG KONG, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares are expected to fall on Monday, led by financials, after U.S. lenders such as Bank of America and Citigroup reported huge losses.  British lender HSBC may extend last week's 14 percent drop on worries about its financial position, said Francis Lun, general manager at Fulbright Securities.  The Hang Seng Index eked out a small gain on Friday, rising 12.55 points to 13,255.51, but it ended the week 7.8 percent lower, its worst weekly performance since the end of October.  'We are seeing a second wave of the banking crisis,' said Lun. 'The U.S. and U.K. may have to save more banks, which showed the depth of the financial crisis.'  Bank of America Corp on Friday reported its first quarterly loss in 17 years as the U.S. government extended a fresh $20 billion in aid to the lender, which is struggling to absorb Merrill Lynch.  Adding to the gloom, Citigroup Inc reported a quarterly loss of $8.29 billion last week and plans to split the bank into two units and shed troubled assets.  STOCKS TO WATCH  THE MAINLAND'S FLAG CARRIER, AIR CHINA, SAID IT expected to report a loss for 2008 due to a slump in traffic and higher fuel prices during much of the year.  CHINA CONSTRUCTION BANK SAID IT WOULD ISSUE UP TO 80 billion yuan ($11.7 billion) worth of bonds, with a maturity of not less than 10 years.  ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2244 GMT ------------  S&amp;P 500 850.12 0.76% 6.380  USD/JPY 90.96 -0% 0.000  10-YR US TSY YLD 2.3405 -- 0.000  SPOT GOLD 841.85 0.00% 0.000  US CRUDE 36.48 3.05% 0.480  DOW JONES 8281.22 0.84% 68.73  ASIA ADRS 90.01 1.45% 1.29  -------------------------------------------------------------  MARKETS SUMMARY  STOCKS RISE ON ENERGY GAIN, FINANCIALS CUT LOSSES  OIL RISES 3 PERCENT ON SHORT COVERING  TREASURIES HIT; SUPPLY FEARS WEIGH AMID DEBT GUARANTEE  DOLLAR, YEN SLIDE AS BOA BOOSTS CONFIDENCE  (Reporting by Jun Ebias; Editing by Ken Wills)  ASIA-PACIFIC STOCK MARKETS: Pan-Asia........
