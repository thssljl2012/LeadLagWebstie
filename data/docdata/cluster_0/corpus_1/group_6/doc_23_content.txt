'The banks are having a particularly bad day and debt refinancing worries  are coming back to the fore,' Blue Oar Securities analyst Derren Nathan says.  Shares in Enterprise Inns, which has net debt of 3.7 billion pounds ($5.36  billion) including a five year bank facility of 1 billion pounds which expires  in May 2011, falls as much as 25 percent. Punch Taverns, which has debt of just  over 4.3 billion pounds, sheds as much as 17 percent.

Santander shares lost about 50 percent of their value in 2008, while RBS  stock tumbled nearly 90 percent in the same year.  'I think in the short term we will see BBVA outperform Santander since it  has a more defensive profile than its larger peer, whose aggressive profile is  more similar to RBS,' a Madrid-based trader says.  RBS and Santander, as well as Dutch bank Fortis, were partners in the  takeover of ABN Amro in 2007. Earlier, RBS said it made a loss of up to 28  billion pounds ($40.58 billion) last year, including a huge goodwill hit on its  purchase of parts of the Dutch bank.  Caja Madrid analyst Javier Bernat says Standard &amp; Poor's decision on Monday  to downgrade Spain's long term sovereign debt rating is also weighing on the  broader banking sector: 'The ratings downgrade will in practice bring with it  higher financing and capital costs for the banks,' he says.  Also in Spain, Santander's peer BBVA fell 3.6 percent on Monday.

'The stock is under pressure due to the weak outlook,' a Dublin based trader  says.  A spokesman for Russian billionaire Alexander Lebedev said last week the  former KGB agent had expressed an interest in buying the London Evening Standard  newspaper as well as other influential papers.  There has been speculation that Lebedev could be interested in INM's London  Independent newspaper. INM has declined to comment on the talk.  'Despite talk of possible Lebedev interest, it has not been enough to lift  Independent News's stock,' the trader says.

The results mark the first time the management have reported profit and  Cenkos believes that 'Galleon is set to out-perform in 2009'.  'Hit shows such as Super Soccer Star and Skunk Fu! will continue to gain  traction in China and South East Asia... Croco Worldwide continues to forge  relationships with some of the world's largest food producers offering good  earnings visibility,' says Cenkos.

The losses spook investors in Britain's other banks, overshadowing a second  bailout for the industry from the UK government.  Shares in Royal Bank of Scotland are down 68 percent at 11 pence and at  their lowest level in more than a quarter of a century. Lloyds Banking Group , which had gained as much as 7 percent in early trade thanks to the  UK's latest rescue package, are down 29 percent. HSBC, Standard  Chartered and Barclays are all about 10 percent lower.  NCB analyst Simon Willis says a gloomy outlook statement from RBS, in which  the bank warned it was impossible to predict the size of future credit losses,  has weighed on other stocks.  'The read-across to other stocks is not great,' said Willis. 'How much  capital is enough? The answer is nobody knows.'  Among Europe's other banks, those in Ireland are some of the weakest with  Allied Irish Banks down 47 percent and Bank of Ireland 30  percent weaker after the resignation of Bank of Ireland's Chief Executive and  last week's nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  Elsewhere in Europe, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank,  Deutsche Postbank and Societe Generale are all down between  8 and 13 percent.  'Once you have one bomb going off, it takes everyone else down with it,'  says one Paris-based fund manager, adding that the RBS news had reignited old  worries that more of Europe's banks will have to raise capital.

'As a result of a 17 percent fall in levered loans and a 27 percent fall in  listed private equity stocks, we believe our estimate of ICG's mark-to-market  book value has gone from 460 million pounds in November 08 to 206 million pounds  today,' the analysts say in a note.  They cut estimated earnings per share by 39 percent for 2009 and 36 percent  in 2010 giving a price target of 710 pence.
