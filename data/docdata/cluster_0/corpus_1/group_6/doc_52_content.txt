TORONTO - Stock markets are weak in early trading on another round of worries centred around the financial sector, even as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. surprised analysts by turning in a fourth-quarter profit and U.S. economic data showed rising applications for unemployment benefits and declining wholesale prices. Toronto's S&amp;P/TSX composite index climbed 27.6 points to 8,715.9 after falling 272 points.  The TSX Venture Exchange slipped 3.43 points to 852.96.  The Canadian dollar moved up 0.08 of a cent to 80.19 cents US following four days of steep declines that cut the loonie's value by about four cents US.  New York's Dow Jones industrials was off 24 points to 8,176.2 after a much worse than expected retail sales report for December helped send the blue chip index down 248 points.  JPMorgan shares rose $1.05 to US$26.96 after it said it earned $702 million, or seven cents per share, in the October-December quarter.  Analysts had expected the company to break even.  However, the bank said it increased its reserves to cover potential loan losses by $4.1 billion, and chief executive Jamie Dimon said higher loan losses are likely if the economy deteriorates further - as seems likely.  JPMorgan is the first big U.S. bank to release fourth-quarter earnings, and analysts and investors were looking at it for signs of how the rest of the industry may be faring.  The Nasdaq composite index was off 2.54 points to 1,487.1 after Apple chief executive Steve Jobs said Wednesday he is taking medical leave until June, a move that sent the company's shares down $3.93 to $81.40.  The announcement marks a reversal from just a week ago, when Jobs, a 53-year-old cancer survivor, tried to assure investors and employees his recent weight loss was caused by an easily treatable hormone deficiency. The S&amp;P 500 declined 4.35 points to 838.25 as new claims for jobless benefits increased more than expected last week, rising to a seasonally adjusted 524,000 in the week ending Jan. 10, from an upwardly revised figure of 470,000 the previous week. Analysts had expected 500,000 new claims.  The government also says wholesale prices dropped for a fifth straight month as gasoline prices fell by a record amount.  Investors are looking to quarterly earnings from chip giant Intel Corp. after the close.  The U.S. government is considering a fresh multibillion-dollar aid package for Bank of America Corp. to help it absorb losses at Merrill Lynch.  The new aid package reportedly could be modeled along the lines of the financial lifeline that was thrown to Citigroup Inc. in November, when the bank received a fresh capital infusion and government backing of billions in risky assets held by the bank. Bank of America shares tumbled 94 cents to US$9.26.  The TSX financial sector edged up 0.25 per cent following a three per cent drop with Scotiabank (TSX:BNS) ahead 32 cents to $30.97.  The TSX energy sector was 0.65 per cent lower after shedding 3.5 per cent as oil prices continued to retreat on concerns about falling demand. The February crude contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange declined 90 cents to US$36.38 a barrel. Suncor Inc. (TSX:SU) surrendered 38 cents to C$25.40.  Shaw Communications Inc. (TSX:SJR.B) said Wednesday its first-quarter earnings increased 10 per cent to $123.1 million compared with a year ago. Revenue in the quarter totalled $817.5 million, up from $743.8 million. Its shares rose 19 cents to $20.14.  Shares in aerospace technology manufacturer Heroux-Devtek Inc. (TSX:HRX) were unchanged at $4.35 after it said it has secured a contract to build landing gear parts for Fokker Services worth between $15 million and $24 million based on current projections.  Mobile handset maker Motorola Inc. said Wednesday it will cut 4,000 more jobs in 2009, in addition to 3,000 it announced last year.  It also said Wednesday it expects revenue for the fourth quarter to be between $7 billion and $7.2 billion, as it saw continued weakness in consumer demand and customer inventory reductions. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected, on average, $7.5 billion in revenue and its shares added 12 cents to US$4.23..  Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average dropped 4.9 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled 3.4 per cent.  Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.43 per cent, Germany's DAX index dipped 0.25 per cent as the European Central Bank cut its interest rates by a half percentage point to two per cent, leaving the rate at its lowest level since December 2005 and France's CAC-40 stepped back 0.45 per cent.
