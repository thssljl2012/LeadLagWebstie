'The market held on to some quite good gains earlier in the session,' CommSec market analyst Juliette Saly said.  'Trading volumes were thin.'  Ms Saly said the market was anxiously awaiting BHP Billiton's December quarter production report on Wednesday amid speculation the mining giant will be forced to close its Ravensthorpe nickel laterite mine in Western Australia due to low prices for the metal.  'There has been some speculation that BHP's quarterly production figures could fall under quite a bit of pressure due to slowing demand (for its products) and a big drop off in commodity prices,' she said.  'But it's continuing to hold up well.'  Resources were positive.  BHP Billiton was up 50 cents at $30.38 while its debt-laden rival Rio Tinto jumped $2.20 to $40.55.  'Rio was once again the stand-out,' Ms Saly said.  'It has been under a lot of selling pressure heading into the end of 2008 but we're starting to see a bit of a recovery in Rio shares.'  The energy sector was stronger.  Woodside gained 2.27 per cent to $34.29, Santos rose 4.62 per cent to $14.73 and Oil Search put on 8 cents to $4.51.  Gold stocks were mostly higher.

NAB was 9 cents higher at $19.44 while Westpac, which is undertaking a capital raising this week at about $16.00, dropped 2 cents to $16.09.  The Commonwealth Bank has split its corporate division from its institutional banking unit to service customers and manage its capital better.  'We also heard of management changes,' Ms Saly said.  She said Commonwealth Bank shares were under pressure for most of morning but closed 8 cents higher at $27.43.
