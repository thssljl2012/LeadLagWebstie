New York stocks continued to rise Friday backed by investor expectations that the unstable financial sector will be soon back on a solid track.   The 30-issue Dow Jones Industrial Average, which gained 12.35 points Thursday, added 68.73 points to 8,281.22 points.   The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, a 22.20 point winner, gained 17.49 points to 1,529.33.   Buying focused on financial issues as investors were spirited by the latest developments on Citigroup and Bank of America.   Citigroup said earlier Friday it will separate the firm into Citicorp and Citi Holdings to restore profitability. Citicorp will focus on traditional banking business while the latter will be in charge of non-core businesses such as securities.   Also earlier in the day, the government agreed to infuse an additional $20 billion in fresh capital to the cash-strapped Bank of America to help it absorb losses at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co, which the bank acquired earlier January.   These developments spawned investor expectations that the U.S. financial sector will restore normalcy in the near future, market analysts said.
