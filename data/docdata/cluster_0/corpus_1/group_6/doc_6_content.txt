The Australian share market has closed more than one per cent higher, despite a flat lead from Wall Street and surrounding economic gloom.   At the 1415 AEDT close, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was up 1.12 per cent at 3,735.70, and the broader All Ordinaries index had risen one per cent to 3,680.40.   BHP Billiton, the world's biggest miner, gained 3.08 per cent to $31.70, while Rio Tinto fell 0.15 per cent to $43.93. Fortescue Metals Group, Australia's third biggest iron ore miner, lost 0.95 per cent to $2.07.   The banks were mixed. Commonwealth Bank of Australia rose 0.84 per cent to $28.80, National Australia Bank added 0.67 per cent to $21.00, ANZ Banking Group fell 0.13 per cent to $15.20, and Westpac Banking Corporation lost 0.42 per cent to $16.50. The energy sector was mostly weaker as world oil prices fell, with Woodside Petroleum dropping 1.23 per cent to $35.98, Santos down 1.09 per cent to $13.81. Oil Search bucked the trend, rising 2.15 per cent to $4.73.   Trading volumes are starting to increase although the level of active participants in the market remains low with many retail clients still on holidays, Ord Minnett private client adviser Jon Hancock said. 'Largely there's a lack of direction in the market. There's a perception (that) we'll go for a little bit of a run on the back of the Obama presidential inauguration on January 20. 'But largely, the uncertainty in the market still exists,' he said. Diversified financials mostly were stronger with the notable exception of Macquarie Bank.   Australia's largest investment bank finished $1.12 or 3.45 per cent lower at $31.38 after Thursday's market update which saw the bank declare the December quarter had been 'exceptionally challenging'. Major retailers also gained ground, with Woolworths 21 cents or 0.81 per cent firmer at $26.23, Wesfarmers Ltd - owner of Coles supermarket chain - adding 27 cents or 1.45 per cent to $18.95, and upmarket department store David Jones adding one cent or 0.33 per cent to $3.06.   Harvey Norman was ten cents lower, or by 3.94 per cent, at $2.44.   Fairfax Media was the only stock in the sector to lose ground, marginally lower by 0.5 cent or 0.29 per cent to $1.695.   Rival News Corporation put on 21 cents or 1.54 per cent to $13.82, and its non-voting scrip was up 14 cents or 1.11 to $12.74, while Consolidated Media jumped 8.5 cents or 4.26 per cent to $2.08.   Beverage companies made gains, with Foster's Group jumping 19 cents or 3.69 per cent higher to $5.34 and Lion Nathan Ltd advancing by 20 cents or 2.61 per cent to $7.87.   Admiralty Resources was the top traded stock by volume, with over 115.4 million shares changing hands for over $4.7 million.   The turnover pushed Admiralty's share price 0.2 cents or 5.56 per cent higher to 3.8 cents.   Preliminary national turnover reached 1.07 million shares traded for a value of over $2.356 billion, with 495 stocks trading up, 367 down and 267 unchanged.
