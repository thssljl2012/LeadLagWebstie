NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Treasurys dropped Friday, pushing yields higher amid optimism over Bank of America's government aid and Citigroup's plan to break apart. Ten-year note yields (: Last: Delayed quote data Analyst   Create alert Insider   Discuss Financials , , ) increased 15 basis points, or 0.15%, to 2.36%. It's the biggest increased since Jan. 2. Two-year note yields (UST2YR:UST2YR Last: Delayed quote data Analyst   Create alert Insider   Discuss Financials , , ) rose 5 basis points to 0.77%. The U.S. government on Friday announced it was injecting $20 billion into Bank of America and guaranteeing losses on over $400 billion of assets both from it and Citigroup.  Citigroup also announced a plan to reorganize its business units, separating the bank from the mortgage-related assets that have caused billions of dollars of write-downs and losses.  U.S. equities futures pointed higher, easing investors' interest in the relative safety of government debt. 'U.S. government backstops, stimulus packages and presidential inauguration optimism are helping offset the gloom emerging from the raw data, translating into stabilized equities,' said Ashraf Laidi, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. Bonds stayed lower after the Labor Department said inflation fell 0.7% in December, marking the smallest annual gain in 54 years. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch expected the consumer price index to drop 0.8% last month.  Core prices, excluding energy and food, were flat, matching expectations. A report at 10 a.m. Eastern time is expected to show consumer sentiment slid further in January. Bond trading is expected to close early ahead of Monday's holiday.
