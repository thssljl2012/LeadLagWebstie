MELBOURNE, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Australian stocks rose 0.8 percent on Friday as resource stocks bounced and investors bet on another hefty  cut in February after UK rates were slashed to a record low overnight.  Australia's rates have already been lowered 3 percentage points to 4.25 percent and markets are pricing a further 125 basis points of cuts by March. 'People are saying that we will probably get another 50 to 100 (basis) point cut in February,' said Rick Klusman, dealer at Aequs Securities.  British interest rates have now fallen by 3.5 percentage points since October. In the United States, rates now range between 0 and 0.25 percent.  Falling rates increase the relative attractiveness of the dividend yields being offered by domestic banks, Klusman added. If  (ASX: NAB.ax) maintained its dividend, the stock would offer a 9.3 percent yield, he said. 'It gets to a point where the interest rates are not really attractive and people start looking at the alternatives,' he said. Australia's benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index .AXJO was up 30.6 points at 3,724.9 at 0006 GMT. Gains could be capped as investors look ahead to U.S. jobs data later on Friday, which is expected to show a rise in unemployment to 7 percent in December.  New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index .NZ50 firmed 0.1 percent to 2,756.96.  STOCKS ON THE MOVE: * Miner  (ASX: BHP.ax) rose 2 percent to A$31.40, recouping some of Thursday's 5.7 percent loss. 'They were probably sold a little bit too far yesterday and are rationalising a bit today,' said Klusman. 0004 GMT  * Newcrest Mining (ASX: NCM.ax) rallied 5.4 percent to A$29.89 after gold prices rose nearly 2 percent on Thursday and the options market signaled bullion could rise further in the near term.  0001 GMT  * Banks were mixed, with Commonwealth BAnk (ASX: CBA.ax) up 0.2 percent but . (ASX: WBC.ax) down 0.2 percent.  0003 GMT  * Alumina Ltd (ASX: AWC.ax) shares rose 4.8 percent to A$1.65. The company announced Judith Downes will replace Ken Dean as Chief Financial Officer on Monday.  0003 GMT (Reporting by Miranda Maxwell)
