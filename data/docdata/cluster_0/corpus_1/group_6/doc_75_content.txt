TORONTO  The Toronto Stock Exchange ended the week Friday in moderately positive territory, a calm finish after Thursday's roller-coaster last minute climb.  The S&amp;P/TSX composite index rose to 8,920.40, gaining 40.79 points, or 0.46 per cent. The composite was down almost two per cent from the previous week's close of 9085.18. The TSX Venture also rose, closing up 21.35 points, or 2.53 per cent, to 865.65. The Canadian dollar climbed to 80.13 cents U.S., up 23 basis points.  'It's been a comfortable day, a fairly calm day, which we don't often seem to get these days,' said Michael Smedley, chief portfolio manager at Morgan Meighan &amp; Associates. 'It's a mixture of performances, nothing alarming in it. It's a little hard to expect commodities to do a really strong move that would be so important to Canadian markets, given that commodity prices seem to be hardly lifting.'  Smedley said it might be the calm before the storm as major companies are set to release their earnings next week.  The biggest news that had investors' ears perked up Friday was more money for Bank of America Corp. The U.S. government announced it will bail out Bank of America by giving it another $20 billion US. The money will help Bank of America deal with almost $100 billion US of expected losses on toxic assets after its acquisition of Merrill Lynch in September.  Nortel Networks Corp. once again topped the list as the most active stock, plunging another 13 per cent to 10 cents as investors continued to abandon the sunken ship. The company announced it was seeking bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, a day before it was expected to pay a $107-million US interest payment on an outstanding loan.  Gainers outpaced losers in Toronto, with six of 10 sub-indexes rising on the day.  Energy stocks climbed 14.47 points as a group to 2,154.46 as oil prices gained $1.11 a barrel to $36.51 US a barrel.  The S&amp;P/TSX materials sub-index also rose, climbing 76.2 points to 2,180.53. Gold closed at $839.90 US an ounce, up $32.60, with Goldcorp Inc. up four per cent to $32.90 in Toronto.  The financials group weighed down Canada's top benchmark exchange, losing 14.72 points to 1,113.67. Dundee Securities analyst John Aiken downgraded both Toronto-Dominion Bank and Royal Bank of Canada to 'sell' on concerns about deteriorating credit quality.  Turning to the U.S., modest gains were seen in American stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 68.73 points, a 0.84 per cent change, to 8,281.22. The S&amp;P 500 meanwhile rose 6.38 points, a 0.76 per cent change to 850.12. The rises mostly came as investors were reassured by the announcement that U.S. Congress advanced legislation that would provide nearly $1.2 trillion US in emergency spending to help kick-start the U.S. economy and fight the recession. The tech-based Nasdaq composite index ended the day up 17.49 points to 1,529.33, a change of 1.16 per cent.
