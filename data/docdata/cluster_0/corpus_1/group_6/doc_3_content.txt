SHARES swung back into positive territory today as the Big Four banks and Woolworths piled on gains.  But the run-up in the S&amp;P/ASX 200 was held in-check by big falls in Westfield, Rio Tinto and Boral, while news that Strathfield Group had called in administrators weighed on sentiment.   Following a positive lead from Wall Street, the benchmark index was up 22.8 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 3466.8 in early afternoon deals.   The broader All Ordinaries was higher by 15.5 points to 3407.8 while the Australian dollar held its position above US66 cents.  Commonwealth Bank led the banking sector higher, surging 6.3 per cent to $26.30, after US counterparts had the biggest gains among 10 sectors in the Standard &amp; Poors 500 Index overnight.  Westpac was up 3 per cent to $15.27, ANZ jumped 5.2 per cent to $13.04 and National Australia Bank advanced 3.2 per cent to $17.87.  Supermarket operator Woolworths rose 1.8 per cent to $26.63 after its first-half sales increased by 8.8 per cent, while Lihir Gold was higher by 3 per cent to $3.12 after fourth-quarter gold production surged 26 per cent in the third quarter to a record 315,000 ounces.   The biggest drag on the market was Westfield, down 5.1 per cent to $11.46, after last night flagging a $3 billion asset writedown and cut in dividend this year. The worlds biggest shopping-centre owner said the writedown would apply to properties across all regions, but the biggest drop in value would be in the US.   Brickmaker Boral trimmed losses to be down 14.7 per cent to $3.48 after cutting its full-year profit guidance by 40 per cent due to the worsening crisis in the US housing market.   Wesfarmers clawed back some ground to be lower by 2.9 per cent, at $15.92, after selling $2 billion worth of shares at $15 apiece to repay debt.   In the resources sector, Rio Tinto plunged 4.7 per cent to $40.19 after saying it had not ruled out an equity-raising to repay $US10 billion ($15 billion) by the end of this year.   There is growing speculation that Rio is planning to raise up to $6 billion through a rights issue.
