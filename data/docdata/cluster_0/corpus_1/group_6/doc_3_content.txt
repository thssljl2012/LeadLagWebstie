 s dive  Oil traded higher yesterday, reaching $43 a barrel after diving 12 per cent overnight, partly due to higher than expected US crude stocks data that hardened evidence of weakening demand.  US inventories of crude oil rose 6.68 million barrels to 325.4 million barrels last week, the highest since May, the Energy Department said in a weekly report on Wednesday.  This clearly signals that there is just no end-user demand, said Mark Pervan, a senior commodity strategist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in Melbourne. We took a big hit yesterday and the market is still digesting the really awful demand drop in the US.  Earlier this week, oil reached a five-week high amid supply concerns due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Russias gas dispute with Ukraine, and signs that OPEC members are enacting supply cuts.  Meanwhile, a senior Saudi government official said oil demand could fall 45 per cent on the global financial crisis, but investments should be increased to ensure supplies are maintained.  Majid al-Munif, an adviser to Saudi Arabias oil minister, said the global financial crisis may cut oil demand by 23 percent to 45 per cent,  Al-Hayat newspaper reported, citing remarks made at a conference on Wednesday.  World oil demand fell by 50,000 barrels per day (bpd) last year, and 450,000 bpd so far this year, according to the United States Energy Information Administration.  Cooling demand was led by a 1.2 million bpd contraction in top consumer the US in 2008, and a further 200,000 bpd drop this year.
