THE Australian share market was marginally higher this morning, with the market relieved that housing finance data for November had met expectations.  At 1200 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was up 7.8 points, or 0.21 per cent, at 3,662.4, and the broader All Ordinaries index had gained 6.9 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 3,600.8.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index contract was 13 points higher at 3,636 on a volume of 8,238 deals.  Patersons Securities associate director John Curtin said trading was very quiet. 'There was an increase of just under 1.5 per cent in housing finance from October to November, with the market looking for 1.5 per cent,' Mr Curtin said. 'That was seen as not worse than expected, which allowed our market to claw back.' Australian housing finance commitments for owner-occupied housing rose 1.3 per cent in November, seasonally adjusted, to 49,192, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.  Wesfarmers lost ground, down 61 cents or 3.49 per cent to $16.88, after the company said it expects first half 2008/09 net profit to be between $850 million and $880 million.  This was after about $150 million in pre-tax provisions and write-downs in the value of some investments. 'That has disappointed the market and raised fear that they may not be able to pay the full year dividend of $2 per share previously forecast,' Mr Curtin said. 'The fear was that it may lead to a profit warning coming through. 'Also, they weren't able to give any guidance on their debt refinancing because it hadn't been done as yet.' By 1215 AEDT, banking stocks were mostly higher with the exception of Commonwealth Bank which eased five cents or 0.18 per cent to $28.34.  National Australia Bank firmed 25 cents or 1.23 per cent to $20.60, ANZ Banking Group added 15 cents or 1.01 per cent to $15.00 and Westpac put on one cent or 0.06 per cent to $16.56.
