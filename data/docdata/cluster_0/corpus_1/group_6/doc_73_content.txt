(RTTNews) - Corn prices surged on U.S. trading and pared some of its recent losses. The grain climbed amid concerns a drought in South America could cause damage to supplies.  March corn futures rose to $3.91 per bushel, up 25.6 cents on the session. Despite the rally, corn lost almost 5% for the week. On a long-term basis, the grain has lost more than 50% of its record high of $7.9925 reached on June 27.  Soybeans for March delivery also surged, adding 25.4 cents to $10.20 per bushel. Wheat added 9.4 cents to $5.782 and cotton climbed 0.31 cent to 48.84 a pound.  Meanwhile, the U.S government agreed with Bank of America (BAC) to provide a $20 billion capital injection and backstop another $118 billion of assets, to facilitate the troubled bank to cope with the losses associated with the acquisition of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Reuters and the University of Michigan released their preliminary report on consumer sentiment in the month of January, showing an unexpected increase by the consumer sentiment index.  The report showed that the consumer sentiment index rose to 61.9 in January from 60.1 in December. The news helped lift the dollar in mid-day trading.  Earlier, a Department of Labor report showed that the consumer price index fell 0.7 percent in December following an unrevised 1.7 percent decrease in November. Economists had been expecting prices to fall by a somewhat more significant 1.0 percent.  On the currency front, the dollar rebounded from early weakness versus other major currencies Friday in New York as initial gains on Wall Street evaporated, fueling increased risk appetite and a move back into lower-yielding currencies such as the dollar and yen.  Crude oil for February finished at $36.51, up $1.11 on the session. Prices had hit as low as $34.18 before turning to the upside.
