NEW YORK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks snapped back from a midday swoon on the soothing assurances of Britain's Barclays bank that it will report a pre-tax profit for 2008, helping bank shares cut their losses on Friday.  Before an unexplained fall in Barclays shares, U.S. and European share prices had traded higher, bolstered by the U.S. government's $20 billion capital infusion into Bank of America. Stocks in Tokyo had closed higher on the bailout news.  Washington's decision, which includes the sharing in losses on $118 billion worth of mortgages, was announced during Asian trading hours and sparked a rally for shares there that extended through much of the European session.  The sell-off in Barclays was so sharp it deflated Wall Street's rally. It also cut the gains in Europe although major indexes managed to rebound to end the week on a high note.  Given the skittish nature of the markets, Barclays quickly issued a statement reassuring investors it will report on Feb. 19 earnings well ahead of analyst estimates. (For more detail, click on).  'For better or for ill, we have to at least keep the banks going,' said Paul Nolte, director of investments at Hinsdale Associates in Hinsdale, Illinois. 'Investors are struggling with what is happening and that's why we're seeing the volatility.'  Oil prices were pushed and pulled between forecasts of lower demand and the impact of cold weather in most of the United States.  Share prices for commodity-based companies were generally stronger on Friday, helping lift stocks overall.  News of the bailout for Bank of America eased some investor concerns about stress in the financial sector and helped pull the U.S. dollar and the yen lower. Gold prices rose as a result of the weaker dollar.  BANKS BATTERED  Bank of America posted its first quarterly loss in 17 years on the heels of the government's midnight announcement of a fresh round of aid to help the largest U.S. bank absorb its Jan. 1 purchase of troubled brokerage Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.  'Coming into 2009, we thought we had the big bailouts past us as far as the financials are concerned, and that we can take TARP money and pit it toward something else,' said Matt McCall, president of Penn Financial Group in Ridgewood, New Jersey.  'Now it's clear that there could be more big banks coming back to the well, asking the government for money. And when does this end and when do they say no? They just keep writing checks,' he added.  Citigroup, the former No. 1 and now No. 3 in U.S. banking, reported a fourth quarter loss of $8.29 billion. Over the past 15 months Citigroup has amassed an astounding $92 billion in losses. The bank announced plans to split itself in two and shed troubled assets.  Citigroup shares lost 8.62 percent to $3.50.  Bank of America's stock fell 13.7 percent to $7.18. The share prices had risen initially on the news of the bailout funds but the size of their quarterly losses -- $15.31 billion for Merrill Lynch and $1.79 billion for Bank of America -- and the need for more funds unsettled investors.  Barclays London-listed share price closed down 24.85 percent and the U.S.-listed shares were in a similar downward spiral. However the statement offered reassurance and the U.S. share price cut its losses in half, ending the day down 13.69 percent at $7.25.  U.S. stocks recouped their losses to end the day but were down for the week.  The Dow Jones industrial average gained 68.73 points, or 0.84 percent, to 8,281.22. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index rose 6.38 points, or 0.76 percent, to 850.12. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 17.49 points, or 1.16 percent, to 1,529.33.  For the week the Dow was down 5.6 percent, the S&amp;P 500, lost 5.9 percent, while Nasdaq gave up 3.02 percent. The broad S&amp;P 500 is now up almost 15 percent since the bear market low on Nov. 21, after starting 2009 up about 20 percent from that level.  U.S. markets will be closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, a day before the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Barack Obama.  European share gains were cut by the close, though major indexes ended the week on a high note.  The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares ended up 1 percent at 803.90 points. However for the week the index fell 7.3 percent.  Commodity related shares were among the biggest gainers, with mining and oil shares such as Chevron rising 1.37 percent, Exxon Mobil gaining 1.88 percent Xstrata adding 6 percent, Total rising 1.1 percent and Rio Tinto gaining 7.6 percent.  Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 2.6 percent in the early hours of the rescue plan. The retreat in the yen also helped lift shares of exporters such as Honda Motor Co which gained 7.95 percent. A weaker yen makes Japanese exports more competitive globally.  The British pound recovered from its early drubbing to trade up 0.43 percent to $1.4719.  The dollar, while down versus a basket of currencies, rose 1.02 percent to 90.70 yen. The euro gained 0.79 percent to $1.3257.  The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 42/32, with the yield at 2.34 percent.  Investors sold longer-dated euro zone government bonds a day after driving the benchmark 10-year yield to an historic low. March German bund futures fell 52 ticks on the day at 125.65, and well off the historic high of 126.53 reached on Thursday.  U.S. light sweet crude oil settled up 3.1 percent, to $36.51 per barrel, and spot gold prices rose 2.8 percent, to $840.30 an ounce.
