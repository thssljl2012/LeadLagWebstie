: Oil steadied above $35 a barrel on Friday after a 5 percent fall overnight, with concerns about the health of the global economy and fuel demand keeping pressure on the market. There was some relief that Bank of America Corp will receive $20 billion fresh cash from the US government and a guarantee for $118 billion of potential losses on toxic assets, but worries over credit losses at big banks continue. US light crude for February delivery was down 11 cents to $35.29 a barrel by 0719 GMT, after a $1.88 fall the previous session. The contract, which expires on Tuesday, touched a low of $33.20 on Thursday, the weakest in nearly a month. London Brent crude for the new front-month March contract fell 34 cents to $47.34, maintaining an unusual premium to the US benchmark due to the recent disruption of Russian gas supplies to Europe and growing US stockpiles. 'Concerns over weakness in oil consumption remain a drag on the oil price,' David Moore, a commodities strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a research note. Oil has fallen about 13 percent so far this week, as a string of dismal figures from major economies stung investor confidence and portended further weakness in oil demand in months ahead. The gloomy global economic outlook prompted Opec to forecast a fall of 180,000 barrels per day (bpd) in world oil demand this year, six times higher than its previous estimate. Investors will be keenly watching US CPI data, due later on Friday, which is expected to show a drop of 0.9 percent in December, while a preliminary index of January consumer sentiment in January is expected to erode to 59.0 from 60.1 in December.
