reversing the previous session's gains as renewed fears of a global recession and a domestic slowdown weighed on the bourse.  The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index fell 146.9 points, or 3.6 percent, to 3,960.9 and the broader All Ordinaries index lost 138.2 points, or 3.4 percent, to 3,921.8.  CMC Markets senior dealer Dominic Vaughan said the local market was plagued by a combination of negative global sentiment, expectations Australia was heading for a recession and thin trading volumes. 'There's a whole lot of negative sentiment still, and there's talk a recession in Australia is unavoidable,' Vaughan said. 'How deep it is, we're not really sure.' The market opened almost 3 percent lower after a fall on Wall Street overnight, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 73.27, or 0.8 percent, to close at 8,870.54.  On Monday, the S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index rose 1.4 percent, buoyed by energy and resources stocks in anticipation that China's 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) economic stimulus package announced Sunday would boost demand for Australian minerals and other commodities.  On Tuesday, big miners lost ground. BHP Billiton fell 1.09 Australian dollars (73 cents) to AU$28.80 ($19.31) and rival Rio Tinto shed AU$1.51 ($1.01) to AU$76.49 ($51.32).  The banking sector was also weaker. Commonwealth Bank gave up AU$2.39 ($1.60) to AU$35.61 ($23.91) and National Australia Bank fell AU$2 ($1.34) to AU$20.15 ($13.53) after a trading halt was lifted following an AU$3 billion ($2 billion) capital raising at AU$20 ($13.43) a share.
