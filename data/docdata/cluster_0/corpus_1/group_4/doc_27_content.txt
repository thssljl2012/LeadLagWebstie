The jobless rate held steady at 4.3 percent, confounding expectations of a rise to 4.4 percent. The participation rate rose to 65.3 percent. * New vehicle sales in Australia fell by 1.3 percent in seasonally adjusted terms in October as turmoil in financial markets dented consumer confidence, an industry survey showed on Thursday. ________________________________________________________________ * The Australian dollar failed to sustain a jump past 68 U.S. cents on better-than-expected jobs data as mounting worries about a global economic slowdown saw investors switch into safe havens such as low-yielding currencies and government bonds. * Gloomy data from the United States served as a timely reminder about the grim outlook for the global economy. Investors dumped stocks and commodities on concerns about falling demand in a downturn. Australia is a major exporter of resources. * Shortly after midday, the Aussie was at $0.6762, off a session high of $0.6815 hit after the jobs data, and down from $0.6888 late here on Wednesday. It struck a two-week peak of $0.7015 on Nov. 4. * The Aussie fell to 66.31 yen from 68.55 yen as a fresh bout of risk aversion saw investors unwind risky carry trades. * Eyes are on the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, both of whom are expected to slash rates on Thursday to support their struggling economies. The Reserve Bank of Australia lowered rates earlier this week by a bigger-than-expected 75 basis points. * Australian bill futures extended gains as investors priced in chances of more domestic rate reductions by the end of the year. * The jobs data did little to alter those expectations as it is seen as a lagging indicator. The government on Wednesday slashed growth forecasts and said unemployment will rise in coming months as the credit crunch bites into economic activity and forces companies to shed labour. * Australian bond futures jumped on safe-haven inflows and hopes of further easing in monetary policy. Three-year bond futures rose 0.12 points to 95.760, while the 10-year futures contract surged 0.155 points to 94.81.
