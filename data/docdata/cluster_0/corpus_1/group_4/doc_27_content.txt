Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  THE dollar was weaker at noon as fears about a global recession have investors selling higher risk assets such as equities and commodities-driven currencies.  At 12.00pm AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6409/15, down 1.90 US cents, or 2.92 per cent, from yesterday's close of $US0.6599/05.  ABN Amro currency strategist Greg Gibbs said local equity markets were lower because of concerns about the health of the global economy.  The dollar received some support today after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) bought the currency.  The intervention by the central bank explained the buying near the $0.6350 level which stopped the dollar falling lower, Mr Gibbs said.  'That is why we are trading in a fairly narrow range.''  Mr Gibbs expected the rest of the local session to be 'tough'' with the RBA possibly limiting the falls in the currency.  'We are probably not going to go too far,'' he said.  'The RBA has drawn a line in the sand, (but) it is not a line they are prepared to defend forever.''  The dollar fell after Wall Street closed lower overnight, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding 4.73 per cent.  The local share market followed that lead, with the S&amp;amp;P/ASX200down 4.52 per cent by 12.07pm AEDT.  'The equity market remains under heavy pressure,'' he said.  'The Aussie dollar remains highly related to equity markets at the moment.''
