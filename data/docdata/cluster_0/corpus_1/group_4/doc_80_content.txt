)  10-YR BOND (DEC) 94.690(-0.130) 5.31(5.19)  3/10 SPREAD +0.805 (+0.75) AUST/US 10-YR SPREAD +135(+125)  S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 4128.5 (4018.0) US10-YR 3.96(3.94)  __________________________ Nov 3______________________________  DATA: Australian September retail sales fell 1.1 percent,  seasonally adjusted, compared with a Reuters poll for a fall of  0.5 percent month-on-month.  * Australian third-quarter house price index was down 1.8  percent, more than analysts' forecast of a 0.5 percent decline,  quarter on quarter.  * The TD Securities-Melbourne Institute monthly inflation  gauge fell 0.2 percent in October, after a 0.4 percent increase  the month before, the first drop since February 2006.  * The total number of job advertisements slid 5.9 percent in  October, from the month before, to an average 231,135 a week, the  sixth straight month of losses. Ads were down 9.8 percent over  October last year, according to the survey from Australia and New  Zealand Banking Corp.  _______________________________________________________________  * The Australian dollar dipped after the soft retail sales  data, but quickly regained ground on the back of a slight  improvement in risk appetite amid rising regional stock markets.  * Investors are slowly returning to riskier assets and  higher-yielding currencies on hopes that a raft of interest rate  cuts by major central bank across the globe would help the world  economy escape a deep recession.  * The European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the  Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) are all set to lower rates this  week to support their struggling economies. That follows cuts by  the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan last week.  * Australian bill futures extended gains, as  investors priced in aggressive rate cuts by the RBA before  year-end. Investors have fully factored in a 50 basis point cut  on Tuesday, when the RBA's monetary policy board meets. That  follows a stunning 100 basis point cut to 6 percent last month.  * Shortly after midday, the Aussie had inched up to  $0.6731 against the U.S. dollar from $0.6729 late here on Friday.  It has gained over 10 percent since hitting a 5- year low of  $0.6007 last last month.  * The Aussie lost 15 percent last month as investors dumped  currencies of commodity producing countries on expectations that  a global recession would hurt demand for natural resources.  Australia is a big exporter of commodities.  * Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on  Friday showed currency speculators increased their short  positions in the Australian dollar. Net short positions increased  to 9,819 contacts in the week to Oct. 28 from 7,234 a week  earlier.  * The Aussie was steady at 66.26 yen, supported by  firmer stock markets which encouraged investors back into  leveraged carry trades.  * Australian bond futures were lower as safe-haven inflows  tapered off. Three-year bond futures eased 0.01 points to 95.495,  while the 10-year futures contract shed 0.13 points to 94.69.
