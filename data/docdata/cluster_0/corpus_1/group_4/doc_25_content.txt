The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is widely expected to cut the overnight cash rate by 50 basis points after the bank's board holds its regular monthly meeting tomorrow.  It Macquarie Equities associate director Lucinda Chan said a good lead from Wall Street on Friday, combined with positive sentiment and the anticipation of another cut to interest rates tomorrow pushed the market into positive territory.  'The Australian dollar is also trading firmly at 68 cents as we speak which has added to an overall sense of confidence,'' she said.  Macquarie Group forecasts a 50 basis point cut from the RBA tomorrow.  Volumes were relatively light on the local bourse given the public holiday in Japan, Ms Chan.  Consumer staples were the standout sector today, with major stocks posting strong gains despite weak September household spending data, Ms Chan said.  'Their rises are unbelievable,'' she said.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that the 1.1 per cent decline in retail sales on a seasonally adjusted basis during September was the biggest monthly fall since April 2005.
