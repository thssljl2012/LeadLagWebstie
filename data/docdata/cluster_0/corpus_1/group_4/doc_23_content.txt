(Adds details, comments)  By Denny Thomas  SYDNEY, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 4.3 percent on Thursday, as miners such as BHP Billiton Ltd  fell on concerns about of a prolonged slowdown in the global economy, while banks fell due to their exposure to collapsed firms.  Media companies were dumped after disappointing earnings and outlook from News Corp , though the battered property sector rallied after a successful equity raising by Mirvac Group . But Foster's Group Ltd , Australia's top brewer, rose 4.1 percent to A$6.09 after Molson Coors Brewing Co acquired an interest in the group. [nSYD424844].  The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index  lost 186.9 points to 4,149.7, based on the latest available data, retreating from a near one-month closing high reached on Wednesday. 'Everyone knows that the U.S. economy is in trouble and share prices have to take account of that,' Brian Eley, a fund manager with Eley Griffiths Group said, referring to Wall Street's tumble on Wednesday.  At Wednesday's close, the Australian share index had rallied 14.3 percent from a four-year closing low reached on Oct. 28 and Eley said Thursday's fall partly reflected some profit-taking after a rebound over the past week. 'We just had a very big bounce and it's natural to have a little bit of a pull back,' Eley added. New Zealand's benchmark share index  fell 45.9 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,840.1.  Banking stocks came under pressure after two of Australia's top four lenders revealed a combined A$352 million exposure to collapsed childcare operator ABC Learning Centres Ltd  and investment firm Allco Finance Group Ltd . Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd , the nation's third-biggest lender, shed 10.8 percent to A$16.95 after saying it had A$182 million ($125 million) exposure to ABC, which appointed administrators earlier on Thursday. ANZ traded without the rights to its latest A$0.74 per share dividend which partly reflected the fall in its shares.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd , the No. 2 lender, lost 2.9 percent to A$38.80 after it said it had A$170 million exposure to Allco.  News Corp tumbled 21.4 percent to A$12.50 after it cut its full-year forecast and posted a worse-than-expected 30 percent drop in quarterly profit. [nN05336661]. That pulled down the media sector, with Seven Network Holdings Ltd  falling 5.7 percent to A$5.42 and Fairfax Media Ltd  slipping 6.5 percent to A$1.94.  PROPERTY RALLY  Property investor Mirvac  rallied 35 percent to A$1.295 after completing a A$500 million equity capital raising to lower its gearing. [nSYU005456].  AXA Asia Pacific Holdings Ltd , an Australian funds manager, fell 10.2 percent to A$4.13, adding to Wednesday's 3.6 percent drop.  Several analysts raised concerns about AXA's capital position and said the company could be next in need to raise equity capital. AXA's bigger rival, AMP Ltd , raised A$450 million on Wednesday by selling shares to institutional investors. An AXA spokeswoman declined comment.  The world's biggest miner, BHP Billiton, fell 7.6 percent to A$29.20 and its takeover target, Rio Tinto Ltd , lost 8.7 percent to A$79.04, while oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum Ltd  slipped 5.0 percent to A$42.67, after sharp falls in oil and metal prices.
