HONG KONG - Asian equities and commodities were bid up sharply Monday in response to a stimulus package announced by China over the weekend. Beijing will spend nearly $600 billion to boost domestic demand.

The news, signaling the likelihood of strengthening demand from China for commodities, pushed up copper futures by as much as $12.80 per pound, to $ 182.50, in Asian trading on Monday. NYMEX crude futures also moved up, by $2.40, to 63.44 per barrel, rebounding after sliding to a 1.5-year low below $60 on Friday.  Money, as a result, poured into mining and raw materials stocks.
