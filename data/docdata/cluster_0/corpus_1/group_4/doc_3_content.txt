1 hour 49 mins ago  Oil drifted lower towards $67 a barrel on Monday as traders shifted their focus back to slowing global energy demand linked to the financial crisis. Skip related content  Price by  PriceStock prices  Company name  Percentage change  Analysts said traders would now be looking for signs that Saudi Arabia was cutting back its crude production in line with OPEC's agreement last month to reduce output by 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd).  U.S. crude was trading 36 cents lower at $67.45 a barrel by 12:18 p.m. British time. London Brent crude was down by 63 cents at $64.66.  'Demand concerns haven't gone away so that's a factor that is weighing on the oil price this morning,' said David Moore, a commodities strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  U.S. oil settled up $1.85, or 2.8 percent, at $67.81 a barrel on Friday, but ended the month down more than 32 percent, the steepest monthly decline ever, as global demand slows.  In three months, oil has wiped out gains that took more than a year to build. It is down more than half since prices struck a record $147.27 a barrel in July as poor economic data added to pressure from weak demand reports in the United States and other key consumer nations.  OPEC members have no choice but to implement agreed output cuts and inform customers of the reductions if they want a stable oil price between $70-$90 a barrel, OPEC President Chakib Khelil said on Sunday.  Khelil said Saudi Arabia was the key to the success of the reductions, and if the world's biggest oil exporter took its time over the operation the oil price could be affected.
