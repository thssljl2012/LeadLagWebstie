Investec says Devro's Q3 IMS reads positively, with the group's board  stating that it is confident full year performance will meet its expectations.  The broker says Devro's sales generally continue to show good growth and the  firm is still showing a positive trend in pricing versus last year, while costs  are in line with the broker's expectations.  Investec says it is leaving its full year forecasts for Devro unchanged  after the trading update, but has increased its target price in line with a  general improvement in sector ratings. The broker has a 'buy' rating on the  shares.

U.S. bank Citigroup says it will cut another 52,000 more jobs, showing  the scale of restructuring and slowdown that is likely across the industry. More  grim economic and jobs data in Britain, France and elsewhere leave little doubt  about the tough outlook ahead, dealers say.  'They (Citi) are telling you it's tough now and it's going to stay tough and  the model needs to change,' a dealer says, adding that banks are likely to  remain out of favour for some time.  The DJ Stoxx European bank index was down 4.6 percent at 162.8  points, after skidding as low as 162.2.
