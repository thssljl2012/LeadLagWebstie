Australian shares have lost half their value in just over a year, before sinking even lower today.  The All Ordinaries had lost $804 billion at the close of trading yesterday.  The broad-market index hit an all-time high of 6873.2 points on November 1, 2007. On the same day, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 share index also hit its high of 6851.5 points.  In afternoon trading today, the S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 came close to half that value when it dipped to a low of 3438.8.  In afternoon trade, S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 0.7%, or 23.6 points, to 3499.6, while the broader All Ordinaries index was down 0.9%, or 29.9 points, to 3483.2.  The market sank today despite a late rally on Wall Street overnight and the lifting of a ban on short-selling.  The resumption of short-selling on non-banking shares comes after a two-month ban imposed by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission to stabilise markets.  'I think most people would be thinking it feels like a hell of a lot more than half,' said James McGlew, senior dealer at Argonaut Securities.  'Psychologically people would be feeling they lost more than half their money some time ago.'  'A number of months ago when the market was hitting around 4600, we called 3400.'  'We thought we were being overly pessimistic.'  Mr McGlew now says the market will play itself out between 2900 and 3200.  'We could see it perhaps bounce a couple hundred points but I don't think it would change the overall trend.'  'As each day passes we're getting closer to the bottom of this and the other side of the equaliton is becoming more tangible.'  'It's also interesting to note the small rallies we've had peter out very quickly.'  'There's not a lot of cash sitting on the sidelines to be thrown at this.'  Mr McGlew said the commentary from the big three US automakers overnight was a 'sort of trigger' for the kind of drops seen lately.  'It sounds as if they're holding a gun to the head of the US govenrment, saying 'If you don't bail us out this economy is completely cactus. You'll see things unfold here like you've never seen before.''  Earlier, ANZ Bank was down 1 cent, or 0.8%, to $13.03 in early trade, while the Commonwealth was down 47 cents, or 1.6%, to $29.63.
