At 1200 AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6409/15, down 1.90 US cents, or 2.92 per cent, from yesterday's close of $US0.6599/05.  During the morning, the unit traded between $US0.6361 and 0.6419.  ABN Amro Australia currency strategist Greg Gibbs said local equity markets were lower due to concerns about the health of the global economy, which has having a negative effect on the Australian dollar.  Wall Street closed lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding 4.73 per cent and the Nasdaq index dropping 5.13 per cent.  Local bourses followed this downward trend, with the All Ordinaries 4.2 per cent lower and the S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index down 4.52 per cent by 1207 AEDT.  'The equity market remains under heavy pressure,' he said.  'The Aussie dollar remains highly related to equity markets at the moment.'  The Australian dollar received some support today after the Reserve Bank of Australia bought the currency.  A RBA spokeswoman confirmed the central bank intervened in currency markets this morning to provide more liquidity into currency markets.  In late October, the RBA intervened several times to support the the local currency when it approached $0.6000.  The intervention by the central bank explained the buying near the $0.6350 level, Mr Gibbs said.  'That is why it was supported at the lows,' he said.  'That is why we are trading in a fairly narrow range.'  Mr Gibbs expected the rest of the local session to be 'tough' with the RBA possibly limiting the falls in the currency.  'We are probably not going to go too far,' he said.  'The RBA has drawn a line in the sand, (but) it is not a line they are prepared to defend forever.'  At 0900 AEDT, the RBA's trade weighted index (TWI) was at 53.3, down from yesterday's close of 54.7.  Meanwhile, the Australian bond market was firmer at noon.  At 1200 AEDT, the yield on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was at 4.903 per cent, down from yesterday's close of 5.100 per cent, while the yield on the June 2011 bond was at 3.740 per cent, down from 3.930 per cent.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December 10-year bond futures contract price was at 95.085, up from yesterday's close of 94.905 while the December three-year contract price was at 96.235, up from 96.050.
