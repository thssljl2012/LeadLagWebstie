The Australian sharemarket was firmly in the red at noon, weighed down by mining stocks following largely softer metals prices overnight and a flat US lead.  At 1200 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 73.2 points, or 1.73 per cent, at 4,148.3, while the broader All Ordinaries index had dropped 66.9 points, or 1.6 per cent, to 4,106.1.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index futures contract was 24 points lower at 4,152 on a volume of 12,280 contracts.  MF Global institutional equities dealer Sam Willis said trading volumes were thin ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia's interest rate decision.  The Melbourne Cup also was preoccupying investors, Mr Willis said. 'Compounding that is (that) we've had a couple of good, strong days and people are happy to take some money off the table,' he said. 'Coming from our offshore office out of Chicago, they see with the US election ... just (achieving) an outcome is going to buoy the stock market to start off with, but if the Democrats were to win, then there would be even more of a relief rally. 'Then to compound that further, if the Democrats secure more seats in the Senate, we (will) see the stock market being a little stronger.' Mr Willis said metals were being widely ignored ahead of the US election and amid market turmoil. 'If the Democrats do get in and we see this relief rally, I think metals will be buoyed,' he said.
