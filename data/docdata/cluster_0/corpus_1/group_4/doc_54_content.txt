The Australian sharemarket has surged after overseas markets rallied following a US government promise to protect banking giant Citigroup, and the release of a 20 billion pound ($47.05 billion) economic stimulus package in Britain.  In early trade, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 share index was up 4.8%, or 160.3 points, to 3585.42, while the broader All Ordinaries index was up 4.5%, or 152.9 points, to 3541.7.  All sub indices were higher, with the materials sector gaining the most - 8.7% - on strong gains by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto.  The financial sector was up 4.25% in early trading.  'We think this is just the ongoing insanity of the current situation in the market,' said Peter Spann, director of stockbroker, Freeman Fox Ltd.  Insanity  'The type of swings we've seen in the markets, of 25% in a couple weeks, of 12% in a day, this is insanity unrelated to the fundamentals of the market.'  'Nobody can really say what is happening precisely at the moment.'  'We just feel it's speculation.'  'The downward movements are unrelated to fundamentals and so are these upward movements.'  'What causes the market to move 5% in three minutes after the open when there's been nothing fundamental changed overnight?'  'One major bank in the world has received a bail-out package from its government. That's not a significant event to change the sentiment of the market.'  The Australian dollar continued its rise, and was trading at 65.42 US cents, 63.47 yen and 50.51 euro cents.
