THE dollar has opened more than US2 cents weaker, hitting a four-week low, as the sharpest fall in Japanese exports since 2001 convinced investors an economic slowdown would hit Asia.  Currency experts say the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) may have to intervene in the foreign exchange market today to stop the local unit from falling back to $US0.6000.   At 7am (AEDT), the dollar was trading at $US0.6129/33, down 3.5 per cent from yesterday's close of $US0.6350/54.   By 7.35am AEDT, the currency had slipped to $US0.6088.  During the offshore session overnight, the local unit moved between a four-week low of $US0.6131, as the local session was about to open, and a high of $US0.6382.  The low point was 38 per cent below the dollar's 25-year high of $US0.9849 reached in mid-July.   The domestic currency slumped after data showed Japanese exports fell by 7.7 per cent in the year to October, marking the sharpest annual decline since December 2001.   Japan, Australia's biggest export market, also posted a surprise trade deficit of 63.9 billion yen in October, from a trade surplus of 999.4 billion yen a year earlier, the nation's Finance Ministry said.   Japanese exports to China fell 0.9 per cent in October, marking the first decline since May 2005.   ANZ senior markets dealer Alex Sinton said news of Japan's dramatic drop in exports, especially to China, showed Asian economies were in trouble. 'I would say it's a general malaise as far as the local economies are concerned,' he said from Auckland. 'The whole region is under pressure: the domino is spreading from the US to Europe to Asia.' Mr Sinton said the RBA was likely to intervene in the currency market today to stop the dollar sinking below $US0.6000. 'The central bank activity is going to smooth things,' he said. The dollar would struggle as New York's Dow Jones Industrial Average finished weaker.   The RBA intervened in the foreign exchange market on November 13, when the dollar fell to $US0.6350, and on October 28, when the currency fell to a five and a half year low of $US0.6012.  In late October, the central bank spent $3.15 billion propping up the dollar, a bigger amount than in early 2001 when the unit hit an all-time low of $US0.4778.
