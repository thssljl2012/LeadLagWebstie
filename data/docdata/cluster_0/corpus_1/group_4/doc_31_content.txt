Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  THE dollar was higher at noon, supported by the return of risk appetite and higher commodity prices.  At 12pm (AEDT), the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6470/74, up US1.85c, or 2.9 per cent, from Monday's close of $US0.6283/91.  During the morning, the local unit moved between a low of $US0.6458 and a high of $US0.6554.  A 20 billion ($46.57 billion) fiscal stimulus package in the UK, and talk of one worth $US700 billion ($1.07 trillion) in the US, fuelled investors' appetite for riskier assets such as equities and the high-yielding Australian dollar.  The dollar opened stronger at 7am (AEDT), starting the local session at $US0.6477/81 as Wall Street rallied and commodity prices rose.  The unit continued its upward trajectory during the morning and reached its intraday high of $US0.6554 at about 10am - before sellers came in and the currency backpedalled almost one US cent.  National Australia Bank head of currency strategy John Kyriakopoulos said despite the buoyant mood during offshore trading, the global outlook remained gloomy.  'The backdrop, which is the recession in the major economies, hasn't really changed,' Mr Kyriakopoulos said.  'That's limiting the extent to which the currencies can rally.  'You tend to find that when they do rally, investors are pretty quick to take profits.'  Weak data, including a closely watched German business confidence survey, which dropped to a 15-year low, and more disappointing US housing figures highlighted the continued downturn in the global economy.  The S&amp;amp;P500 index ended the New York session up 6.47 per cent, its second consecutive positive finish.  'We've had two days of rallying equity markets in the US, which hasn't happened very often,' Mr Kyriakopoulos said.  'I guess there might be a few people who might be betting we're not going to get three.'  The S&amp;amp;P500 index has not rallied for three straight sessions since September 10-12 this year.  Crude oil for January delivery rose $US4.57 to settle at $US54.50 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
