LONDON (Reuters) - Oil fell below $66 a barrel on Monday as traders shifted their focus back to slowing global energy demand linked to the financial crisis.  Analysts said traders would now be looking for signs that Saudi Arabia was cutting back its crude production in line with OPEC's agreement in October to reduce output by 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd).  U.S. crude was trading $2.01 lower at $65.80 a barrel by 11:18 a.m. ET. London Brent crude was down by $2.80 at $62.52.'Demand concerns haven't gone away so that's a factor that is weighing on the oil price this morning,' said David Moore, a commodities strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  U.S. oil settled up $1.85, or 2.8 percent, at $67.81 a barrel on Friday, but ended the month down more than 32 percent, the steepest monthly decline ever, as global demand slowed.  In three months, oil has wiped out gains that took more than a year to build. It is down more than half since prices struck a record $147.27 a barrel in July, as poor economic data added to pressure from weak demand reports in the United States and other key consumer nations.  Societe Generale said on Monday it had lowered its oil price forecasts as global oil demand was likely to weaken further. The bank expects U.S. crude to average $72.50 a barrel next year. Its previous forecast was $114.17.  OPEC members have no choice but to implement agreed output cuts and inform customers of the reductions if they want a stable oil price between $70 and $90 a barrel, OPEC President Chakib Khelil said on Sunday.  Khelil said Saudi Arabia was the key to the success of the reductions, and if the world's biggest oil exporter took its time over the operation, the oil price could be affected.
