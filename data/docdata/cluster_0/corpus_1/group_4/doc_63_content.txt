 Market watch top headlines Australian reports Aust markets:  :  :  World reports World commodities:  World markets:   FLT, RIC, MGX, WBC, SGB, CTX, AFG, NLX, MML, BNB, MGR, APN, AHE,   AAP 2008-11-03   The Australian sharemarket has made a strong start to November, up more than two per cent at midday, driven higher by financial stocks ahead of an expected 50 basis point rate cut in interest rates by the Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday.  Analysts say October's panic-driven selling had been in line with an historical trend of October being the worst month for the markets.  But confidence appears to be returning as fund managers take advantage of bargain stocks, supported by retail investors as credit markets thaw somewhat.  At 1214 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was up 108.5 points, or 2.7 per cent, at 4,126.5, while the broader All Ordinaries index had advanced 105.9 points, or 2.66 per cent, to 4,088.6.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index futures contract was 100 points higher at 4,136 on a volume of 15,613 contracts.  IG Markets institutional dealer Chris Weston said analysts were expecting more conservative gains on Monday. 'We didn't expect it to open as high as it has,' Mr Weston said. 'We expected the materials sector to be slightly weaker. We did see copper relatively flat - it was down about 30 per cent last month, the largest monthly drop in about a decade ... as investors saw a large inventory stacking up on the London Metal Exchange. 'Nickel had a good rally after falling about eight per cent at one point.' Mr Weston said poor purchasing figures from China on Friday had not been completely factored into the local market on Monday, which appeared to be hopeful of an aggressive interest rate cut on Tuesday. 'The RBA can surprise,' he said. Mr Weston said the banks currently offered excellent buying opportunities.  At 1218 AEDT, ANZ had risen 66 cents, or 3.8 per cent, to $18.02, National Australia Bank had gained 61 cents, or 2.54 per cent, to $24.60 and Commonwealth Bank added 62 cents, or 1.54 per cent, to $40.92.
