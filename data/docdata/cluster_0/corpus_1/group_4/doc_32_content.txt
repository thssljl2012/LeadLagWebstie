Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  THE share market remained in negative territory at noon, despite gains in resource giant BHP and a positive lead from Wall St.  In early trade, BHP shares rose eight per cent after announcing it had abandoned its multi-billion-dollar takeover bid for rival Rio Tinto due to the turmoil in global financial and commodity markets.  At 12pm (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 13.8 points, or 0.38 per cent, at 3609.6, while the broader All Ordinaries dropped 29.4 points, or 0.82 per cent, to 3546.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index futures contract was up eight points, or 0.22 per cent, at 3627 points on volume of 17,304 contracts.  Intersuisse director of equities Andrew Sekely said the modest gains on Wall St overnight had not been enough to lead the Australian market into positive territory.  'New York was down 100 points and then rallied fairly late, so it's not entirely convincing,' Mr Sekely said.  'What we have at the moment is very uncertain times. We're only down eight points (at the time) and it's just reflective of the fact that there's not a great deal of confidence out there on the market.'  Mr Sekely said gains in BHP stocks were understandable.  'The fact that they're not continuing in an obviously long drawn-out battle with Rio, in the current climate, is viewed to be positive.'  At 12.01pm (AEDT), BHP Billiton had gained $2.06, or 7.86 per cent to $28.28 while Rio Tinto lost $20.26, or 31.71 per cent, to $43.64.
