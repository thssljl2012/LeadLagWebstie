The Australian share market closed around two and a half per cent weaker despite gains in resource giant BHP Billiton and a positive lead overnight from Wall Street.  At 1615 AEDT close, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 83.4 points, or 2.3 per cent, at 3540.0, while the broader All Ordinaries dropped 95.8 points, or 2.68 per cent, to 3479.6.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index futures contract fell 82 points, or 2.27 per cent, at 3537 points on volume of 29,150 contracts.  Margin calls after BHP Billiton scrapped its $US66 billion ($A100 billion) proposed bid for Rio Tinto had the equities market finish in negative territory.  IG Markets research analyst Ben Potter said the market had drifted throughout the day, with sellers selling into the strength. 'The BHP Rio issue is an absolute mess for anyone who holds Rio Tinto,' he said. 'There has been a few big margin calls go out for that today,' he said. 'I think there is going to be an overhang of stock being sold for Rio Tinto over the next couple of days.' Market talk was that Rio would have to raise capital as well, Mr Potter said.  BHP Billiton finished $1.03, or 3.93 per cent, stronger at $27.25, while Rio Tinto plunged $21.89, or 34.26 per cent, to $42.01.  Other resources stocks also lost ground by 1615 AEDT, with Oil Search down 27 cents, or 5.68 per cent, to $4.48, Santos losing 56 cents, or 3.85 per cent, to $14.00 and Woodside Petroleum $1.60, or 4.78 per cent, weaker at $31.90.  Newmont Mining Corporation was the only bright spot in the gold sector, gaining seven cents to $4.86, while rival Newcrest Mining eased 45 cents, or 1.77 per cent, to $25.00.  Spot gold in Sydney was trading at $US813.75 an ounce, down $US2.40 on Tuesday's local close of $US816.15.  Losses across the banking sector were a surprise given the bailout package for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the US, Mr Potter said 'I think it's just about short term profit taking in a bear market,' he said. Westpac dropped $1.23, or 6.9 per cent, to $16.60, while Commonwealth Bank fell $1.34, or 3.94 per cent, to $32.66.
