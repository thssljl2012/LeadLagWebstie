TOKYO, Nov. 6-(Kyodo), The euro fell against the dollar and the yen on Thursday in Tokyo on speculation that the European Central Bank and the Bank of England will cut interest rates later in the day to prevent the financial crisis from further hurting the European economy.  Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar stayed rather firm against the yen despite a steep fall in Asian equities, including Japan's key Nikkei index, as the recent trend of panicky selling of the U.S. currency has subdued.  At 5 p.m., the dollar fetched 97.90-93 yen against 97.90-98.00 yen in New York and 99.37-38 yen in Tokyo at 5 p.m. Wednesday. It traded between 97.57 yen and 98.38 yen during the day, most frequently changing hands at 97.90 yen.  The euro traded at $1.2860-2863 and 125.92-96 yen versus $1.2950-2960 and 126.82-92 yen in New York and $1.2842-2843 and 127.61-65 yen in Tokyo late Wednesday.  Market players expect both the ECB and the BOE to cut their key interest rates by 0.5 percentage point to 3.25 percent and 4.0 percent, respectively, dealers said.  Some players anticipate even larger rate cuts -- 0.75 point by the ECB and 1 point by the BOE, they added. 'If that happens, the euro could drop further, but after a round of selling, it may spark euro-buying as it could boost stock markets and ease worries over the economy in the eurozone,' said Toru Umemoto, chief foreign exchange strategist in Tokyo at Barclays Bank.  The dollar, meanwhile, maintained its steadiness against the yen, rising as high as to the lower 98 yen level, despite a tumble in Asian equities which usually alleviates investor risk appetite and leads to dollar selling. The Nikkei briefly shed more than 7 percent.  Akihiro Tanaka, senior currency trader at Resona Bank, said, 'Panic selling seen in recent weeks has subdued and investors did not have to dump their dollar holdings on a fall in the stock market.' Investors refrained from pushing the dollar further ahead of the U.S. nonfarm productivity and unit labor cost data and weekly jobless claims later in the day as they want to assess the real state of the U.S. economy, Tanaka added. But Umemoto said, 'Worse-than-expected data could be a blow to the stock market and eventually prompt dollar selling.' U.S. stocks plunged overnight in New York after a report released by a manpower service firm showed job cuts by major U.S. companies surged 79 percent in October from a year earlier to 112,884, the highest since January 2004.  The data raised concerns about U.S. employment and the economy ahead of monthly U.S. government jobs data due out Friday, analysts said.  The dollar was also underpinned by buying by some speculators who got a late start to buy the U.S. currency below the 100 yen mark, Tanaka added.
