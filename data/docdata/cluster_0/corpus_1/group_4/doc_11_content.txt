Ausbil Dexia chief executive Paul Xiradis said the falls on local markets were across the board. 'We're seeing financials, resources and listed property trusts weaker,' he said. 'I think the only part of the market where I see a bit of green is in the telecommunications sector, which is really Telstra.  Weaker commodities overnight pulled down local resource companies.

The news followed ANZ saying yesterday that ABC owed it $182 million, Westpac saying it had a credit exposure of about $200 million, and NAB $140 million.

ABN Amro Morgans private client adviser Bill Bishop said the falls on local markets had followed the second daily decline on Wall Street. 'They have gone back to realising Barack Obama cannot save them overnight because he does not get into power for some time,'' he said. 'He will do what he can, but this disaster has taken a long time to put together and it's gathering momentum. 'Those who suggested that the bottom had arrived, maybe are possibly rejigging their estimates.''  Mr Bishop said equity markets were paying for firms lowering their debt levels. 'Credit is very tight. People have to sell things without raising money,'' he said. 'If they cannot raise money from the banks, they have to sell things.''  Mr Bishop said it was likely local shares would end the day lower.  Local energy stocks were lower after another plunge in the price of oil on fears of falling demand from a global recession.
