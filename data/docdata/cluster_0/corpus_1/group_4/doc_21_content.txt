The Australian sharemarket closed almost 3 per cent higher after a surge in commodity prices caused strong gains in resources stocks.  The Australian dollar also soared as Senator Barack Obama's victory in the United States presidential election made financial markets upbeat. The dollar closed 4 per cent stronger, trading at US69c, up US2.64c from Tuesday's close of US66.53c.  Austock Securities senior client adviser Michael Heffernan said, ''It was an  over resources-led boom today.''  The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was 121.5 points, or 2.88 per cent, higher at 4336.6, while the broader  Ordinaries gained 117.5 points, or 2.82 per cent, to 4287.3.   At the close of day trading on the Sydney Futures Exchange the December share price index contract was 154 points higher at 4365, on a volume of 32,834 contracts.  ''The absolute stars of the day, you would have to say, are the big trifecta of resource stocks BHP, Rio and Newcrest which are  up over 8per cent,'' Mr Heffernan said.  Fortescue Metals Group rose 10c, or 3.4 per cent, to $3.04. The spot price of gold in Sydney closed at $US754.90 an ounce, up $US29 on Tuesday's local close of $US725.90 an ounce.   The gold miners were stronger, Newcrest rose $1.85 to $22.50, Lihir rose 13c to $2.20 and Newmont rose 7c to $4.07. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 305.45 points, or 3.28per cent, to close at 9625.28.  The Australian banking sector was mixed; ANZ rose 20c to $19, National Australia Bank rose 38c to $25.90, Westpac fell 76c to $21.54 and the Commonwealth Bank fell 80c to $41.  Among media stocks, Consolidated Media Holdings rose 22c to $2.30, Fairfax rose 12c to $2.07, News Corp fell 5c to $15.90 and its non-voting shares fell 20c to $15.75. West Australian Newspapers Holdings fell 1c to $6.69.  Retailers were mixed, with Woolworths rising 27c to $29.37, Wesfarmers rose $1.13 to $24.44, Harvey Norman rose 1c to $3 and David Jones steady at $3.40.  In the energy sector, Woodside rose $1.03 to $45, Santos rose 76c to $14.89 and Oil Search rose 42c to $4.96.  Queensland Gas Company was the most traded stock by volume with 258.6 million shares changing hands, worth $1.49 billion.  Market turnover reached 1.68billion shares, worth $6.38billion, with 679 stocks up, 365 stocks down and 264 unchanged. But the Australian bond market closed weaker after a large sell-off at the start of the local trading day.  The yield at 4.30pm yesterday on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was at 5.342 per cent, up from yesterday's close of 5.263 per cent, while the yield on the June 2011 bond was at 4.333 per cent, up from 4.275 per cent.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December 10-year bond futures contract price was at 94.655, down from Tuesday's close of 94.730 while the December three-year contract price was at 95.640, down from 95.695. The Australian bond market sold off sharply when the local session opened, and moved little for the rest of the local trading day.  Economic data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which showed building approvals fell 7.2 per cent in September to their weakest levels in seven years, failed to spark a bond market ry. The bureau will issue the labour force report for last month this morning. AAP
