The Australia share market has closed almost three per cent higher after a surge in commodity prices overnight caused strong gains in local resources stocks and hopes of a big rally on Wall Street overnight.  At the 2.15pm close, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was 121.5 points, or 2.88 per cent, higher at 4336.6, while the broader All Ordinaries gained 117.5 points, or 2.82 per cent to 4287.3.  At 2.15pm, on the Sydney Futures Exchange the December share price index contract was 138 points higher at 4349, on a volume of 29,466 contracts.  It was an all over resources-led boom today, Austock Securities senior client adviser Michael Heffernan said.  The absolute stars of the day you would have to say are the big trifecta of resource stocks - BHP, Rio and Newcrest, which are all up over eight per cent.  I think the market also probably got a kicker from the American presidential election results, with a bit of euphoria going on there.  Many pundits are predicting a rally of hope on the Dow overnight in the wake of the election of US Senator Barack Obama as the countrys new president.  BHP Billiton put on $2.48, or 8.52 per cent to $31.60, Rio Tinto gained $6.89, or 8.64 per cent to $86.60 and Fortescue Metals Group adding 10 cents, or 3.4 per cent to $3.04.  The spot price of gold was stronger and was trading at $US750.35 an ounce by 2.17pm, up $US24.45 on yesterday's local close of $US725.90 an ounce.  The gold miners were stronger, with Newcrest adding $1.85 to $22.50, Lihir picking up 13 cents to $2.20 and Newmont gaining seven cents to $4.07.  The market opened higher following a positive lead from Wall Street, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 305.45 points, or 3.28 per cent, to close at 9625.28.  The banking sector was mixed, with ANZ adding 20 cents to $19.00, National Australia Bank picking up 38 cents to $25.90, Westpac dropping on 76 cents to $21.54 and Commonwealth Bank shedding 80 cents to $41.00.  Bendigo and Adelaide Bank (Bendigo) picked up 49 cents to $13.99 after the company withdrew its $75 million capital raising due to uncertainty in the financial markets.  Allco Equity Partners gained five cents to $1.85 after the company distanced itself from the move by Allco Finance Group to place itself into administration, saying its finances are completely separate from the troubled company.  Wealth manager AMP dropped nine cents to $5.89 after the company raised $450 million in new capital following an institutional placement of shares.  CSR put on seven cents to $2.24 after the company said it saw opportunities to restructure its wide-ranging business but the housing market downturn and general market volatility prevents it from acting in the short term.  The media sector was mixed, with Consolidated Media Holdings gaining 22 cents to $2.30, Fairfax finding 12 cents to $2.07, News Corp shedding five cents to $15.90 and its non-voting shares losing 20 cents to $15.75.  Newspaper publisher West Australian Newspapers Holdings lost one cent to $6.69 despite the company lifted earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2008/09 amid a weaker advertising market.  Mirvac Group, which is in a trading halt, has downgraded its profit outlook by nearly 50 per cent and is seeking to raise $500 million in equity to strengthen its balance sheet and repay debt.  Shares in Mirvac last traded at 98.5 cents.  The retailers were mixed, with Woolworths adding 27 cents to $29.37, Wesfarmers gaining $1.13 to $24.44, Harvey Norman putting on one cent to $3.00 and David Jones steady at $3.40.
