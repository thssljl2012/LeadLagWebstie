TOKYO : The greenback surged in Asian trade Wednesday boosted by hopes that the next US president will draw up new measures to stem the financial crisis.  The dollar rose to 99.76 yen in Tokyo morning trade, up from 99.69 in New York late on Tuesday. The euro eased to $1.2942 from $1.2975 and to 129.09 yen from 129.36 yen.  The euro and the British pound were also in focus ahead of expected interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England on Thursday.  .  Interest rate cuts usually make currencies less attractive to investors but analysts noted that the Australian dollar had rallied after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates by more than expected on Tuesday to spur growth.
