November 5 - OPEN: The New Zealand dollar climbed strongly overnight to a two-week high against the greenback, as the United States currency endured its biggest one-day drop against a basket of currencies in 13 years.  Investors were betting that global interest rate cuts, which would typically boost the US currency, will stimulate growth and alleviate the global financial crisis.  The Reserve Bank of Australia yesterday cut rates by a more-than-expected 75 basis points and the European Central Bank and Bank of England meet later this week.  Though rate cuts typically erode support for a currency, given the global financial crisis, moves to stimulate economies are being seen as currency positive.  By 8am today the NZ dollar was buying US60.58c, having peaked earlier today at its highest level in two weeks near US61.30c, after climbing from US58.70c at 5pm yesterday.  ANZ bank said that having weathered a weaker Australian dollar yesterday and survived support tests of its own, the NZ dollar looked to be in demand.  The aussie bounced back from an early fall after the interest rate cut, with the kiwi down to A87c by today's local open from A88.44c at 5pm.  The NZ dollar climbed to a month-high against the euro near 0.4750 early today before falling away to 0.4666 by 8am, little changed from yesterday's local close.  Against the yen, the kiwi reached a two-week around 61.55 early today before easing to 60.72 by 8am, up from 57.95 yesterday evening. The trade weighted index was 60.66 at 8am from 59.75 at 5pm.  - NZPA  Next Story: NZX wants imputation credits axed
