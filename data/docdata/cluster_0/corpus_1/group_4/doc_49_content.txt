THE dollar opened firmer today as the weakest US manufacturing survey result in seven years dented the US currency. At 7am AEDT, the dollar was trading at $US0.6551/56, up one US cent, or 1.5 per cent, from Monday's close of $US0.6450/58.  This was the unit's strongest session debut since November 12, when the dollar opened at $US0.6583/88.   Overnight, the local unit moved between a low of $US0.6455, hit soon after midnight, and a late offshore session high of $US0.6596, marking a 2.2 per cent range.   The high point was 9.7 per cent firmer than the dollar's five and a half year low of $US0.6012 reached in late October.  The dollar benefited as the weakest US manufacturing survey result since 2001 put the US currency under pressure.   The New York Empire State Manufacturing survey produced an index reading of minus 25.4 points in November, down from October's minus 24.6, marking the worst result in the report's seven-year history.   Bank of America senior currency strategist John Rothfield said the manufacturing survey result sparked a sell-off in the US dollar, which helped high-yielding currencies like the dollar and the euro. 'It kind of confirmed the market's worse fears ... about the US economy,' he said from San Francisco.   Earlier in the offshore session, the dollar made gains as Wall Street climbed. 'The stock market underwent a bit of a recovery, the (US) dollar was sold off, which seemed to benefit foreign currencies like the Aussie,' Mr Rothfield said. New York's S&amp;amp;P 500 index was 0.88 per cent weaker at 7am AEDT, but the dollar still managed to stay well above $US0.6500.   Slides in the dollar, usually associated with drops in US share markets, were minimised in offshore trade.  Still, Mr Rothfield said the dollar was more likely to face selling pressure today as traders took direction from Asian equity markets. 'People are selling on the rallies rather than buying on the dips,' he said. 'At the moment, it doesn't feel like we have a stabilisation of risk.' Financial markets are expecting the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to cut interest rates, now at 5.25 per cent, by up to another 100 basis points in December.   Traders are likely to read the minutes of the RBA's November board meeting, due out at 11.30am AEDT, for clues on the next rate move.   The RBA cut rates by 75 basis points on November 4.
