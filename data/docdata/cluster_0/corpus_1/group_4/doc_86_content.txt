Sponsored Links Australia's central bank said it had intervened to buy Australian dollars as the currency dived over 4 percent amid wild volatility and tumbling global stock markets.  A spokesman for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said it had acted to provide liquidity, as it has done on several recent occasions when the market became disorderly.  The Australian dollar had slid almost three US cents to a one-month low of $A0.6075 ($NZ0.71) before the RBA stepped in, but its action only managed to lift the currency slightly to $A0.6090.
