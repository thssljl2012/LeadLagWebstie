Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  THE share market closed marginally weaker after a larger than expect interest rate cut by the central bank boosted the bourse back from earlier sharply lower levels.  The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 6.4 points, or 0.15 per cent, at 4215.1, while the broader All Ordinaries index had shed 3.2 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 4169.8.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange at 1620 AEDT, the December share price index futures contract was 43 points higher at 4,219 on a volume of 27,255 contracts.  DJ Carmichael research assistant Peter Kopetz said the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) 75 basis point cut was surprising, surpassing most analysts' expectations of a 25 to 50 basis point cut.  'It suggests the RBA is worried about the health of the Australian economy,'' Mr Kopetz said.  'Hopefully, it will be for the better in the long run for the Australian economy,'' he said.  Mortgagors will be happy but for companies like BHP and Rio, it suggests there are problems with China, with everything else, and I'd be looking at it quite conservatively and be a little bit worried for the next six months, he said.  'There are speed bumps ahead.''  Mr Kopetz said the key indices' roughly 40 point jump was a 'keen jerk reaction'', with the market desperately seeking 'a catalyst to move it forward''.  He said a Democratic win in the US tomorrow would be a positive and there was a strong possibility the local market 'may have reached its bottom last week at about 3600 points''.  'But things could change in an instant.''  The major banks were mixed. ANZ rose 30 cents, or 1.62 per cent, to $18.80, Commonwealth Bank inched four cents lower to $41.80 and National Australia Bank was up 42 cents, or 1.67 per cent, to $25.52.
