(Adds Bank of Queensland, Commonwealth, ANZ, Perpetual)  SYDNEY, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose 1.97 percent on Friday, pulling back from an initial bounce following a surge on Wall Street as the focus returned to underlying economic gloom.  The market weakened on very low trading volumes, poor sentiment and little optimism, analysts said, with some financial stocks pulling back. 'It's very underwhelming today. Ordinarily you might have expected the market to potentially be up the similar magnitude it was down yesterday, but this shows just how rattled investors are, which is very rattled,' said Peter Wright, dealer at Burrell &amp;amp; Co.  By 0357 GMT the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index  stood 76.2 points higher at 3,7773.5, off an earlier high of 3,858.4.  New Zealand's benchmark NZX-50 index  closed 1.3 percent higher to 2,764.9.  STOCKS ON THE MOVE  * Financial shares pulled back, with Bank of Queensland  down 1.64 percent at A$12, and the country's third largest bank, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group  falling 0.14 percent to A$14.05 after newspaper reports the bank was to cut a large number of jobs.  Fund manager Perpetual Ltd  fell 0.03 percent to A$33.54. 'It's essentially a pretty small pond out here, so if Commonwealth is having impairment problems, you can bet that there will be a deterioration on the other three as well,' said Wright. On Thursday, Commonwealth Bank of Australia  warned of a big jump in bad debts. Shares in CBA were up 1.12 percent at A$33.37.  0407 GMT  * Gold producer Lihir Gold Ltd  rose 7.3 percent to A$1.90 after a rise in U.S. gold futures, though gold prices slipped later to a near three week low in Asian trading. 0140 GMT  * Property developer FKP Property  was down 7.6 percent to A$1.04, as the sector continued to feel strain amid funding pressure. 'The property sector is still under strain and it will probably remain as the economy is still faltering as well. They could be in for a long haul,' said Vaughan. 0140 GMT  * Miners Rio Tinto Ltd  and BHP Billiton Ltd  were up 6.2 percent and 6.4 percent at A$73.30 and A$26.60 respectively.  Other resource-related stocks to benefit from higher commodity prices included Mincor Resources NL , up 13.8 percent to A$0.74, and mining services group Macmahon Holdings Ltd , which was up 9.2 percent to A$0.47.  2337 GMT * Austal Ltd  rose 30 percent to A$2.10, after the company was awarded a $185 million contract on by the U.S. Navy to design and build a new Joint High Speed Vessel, and said options for nine more ships could bring the total value of the contract to $1.6 bln over time.  2333 GMT  * Fertiliser maker Incitec Pivot Ltd  fell 17.3 percent to A$3.09 after announcing it had completed the A$819 million ($546 million) institutional part of its heavily discounted rights offer, in which the company is seeking to raise A$1.17 billion [nSYU005526].  2331 GMT  * Shares in New Zealand technology manufacturer Rakon slumped 24.3 percent to A$1.28 after the company reported a sharp fall in half year profit, as the recession hit sales [nWLF001173].  2330 GMT (Reporting by Mette Fraende)
