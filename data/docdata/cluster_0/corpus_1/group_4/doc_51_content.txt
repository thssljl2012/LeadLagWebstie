At 0700 AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6406/11, down 1.9 US cents, or 2.9 per cent, from yesterday's close of $US0.6599/05.  It was the weakest start to the local session since October 30, when the unit opened at $US0.6406/13.  During the overnight session, the unit traded between a low of $US0.6352 - a two-week low - and high of $US0.6663.  The Australian dollar moved in line with softer commodity prices overnight as crude oil touched a 20-month low.  Crude oil for December delivery fell to $US56 a barrel during trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  The front-month crude oil contract has declined 62 per cent since it peaked at $US147 a barrel in mid-July.  Gold was also lower overnight.  Wells Fargo currency strategist Vassili Serebriakov said the slowdown in emerging markets, and the expected drop in demand, had fuelled the latest decline in commodity prices.  'We do see, especially in the short term, the prospects are quite negative for the commodity currencies,' Mr Serebriakov said from New York.  'Emerging economies have now joined the developed economies in this quite sharp slowdown.'  The Australian dollar also suffered from another poor day on Wall Street - the major indices in New York were down about four per cent at 0700 AEDT.  As an indication of the heightened risk aversion, the Australian dollar was also lower against the Japanese yen - at 0700 AEDT, the unit was trading at 61.20/25 Japanese yen, down 3.3 per cent from yesterday's close of 64.48/55 yen.  The Australian dollar had traded within a five-US cent range between $US0.6500 and $US0.7000 since the start of November until yesterday.  Mr Serebriakov said he expected the significant break below $US0.6500 overnight to continue, with the unit to test $US0.6000 by January next year.  The Australian Bureau of Statistics releases average weekly earnings data for the August quarter at 1130 AEDT.  The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer inflation expectations for November is also due out today.  Mr Serebriakov expected the Australian dollar to remain under pressure today, but said investors would hold back from making any big moves ahead of the Group of 20 (G20) leaders meeting this weekend.  At 0900 AEDT, the Reserve Bank of Australia's trade weighted index (TWI) was at 53.1, down from yesterday's close of 54.7.  More to come...
