(Adds comments, details)  SYDNEY, Nov 4 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 1.5 percent on Tuesday, led down by miners such as BHP Billiton Ltd , as more weak data out of the United States stoked concerns about a prolonged downturn in the global economy.  The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index  was down 61.2 points at 4,162.6 by 2352 GMT, after rising 11.3 percent in the past four trading days.  Corporate results and outlooks darkened on Monday, and automotive companies across the globe said October sales were the weakest in about 20 years as economies weakened and consumer credit dried up.

We are seeing some severe ups and downs in this market and that's typical of a bear market,' said Lucinda Chan, a division director with Macquarie Equities.  Investors are also waiting for the Reserve Bank of Australia's interest rate decision at 2:30 p.m. (0330 GMT), with markets pricing in a 50 basis points cut in the benchmark cash rate to 5.5 percent.  Chan said the mood was slightly edgy ahead of the decision with some investors locking in gains made over the past four days.
