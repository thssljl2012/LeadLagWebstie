By Jacqueline Mackenzie  Bonds were between 6.5 and 11 basis points firmer in early trade today, shrugging off the softer rand which has weakened to the R10/$ level again.  By 08.35am the short-term government R153 bond was at 9.480% from its previous close of 9.540%. The medium-term R157 was at 8.875% from 8.970% at yesterday's close and the long-term R186 was bid at 8.550% from 8.660% before.  The rand was last at 10.0288 per dollar from a previous close of 10.0170.  A local bond trader said bonds were ignoring the weaker rand and had seen some short-covering after the Australian central bank cut interest rates by 75 basis points, leading some to believe that local interest rates might also come down.  Dow Jones Newswires reports that the euro fell sharply against the yen and the dollar today in Asia after a bigger-than-expected rate cut by the Australian central bank spawned speculation that the European Central Bank may take stronger easing steps.   The euro's tumble versus the two major counterparts was triggered mainly by the Reserve Bank of Australia's bigger-than-expected 75 basis-point rate cut to 5.25% and the bearish economic outlook expressed by RBA Governor Glenn Stevens.  After the rate announcement, the Australian dollar plunged to a low of $0.6609 to the dollar and Y65.07 to the yen.  The fall, in turn, triggered the slide in the euro and the British pound, dealers said. The pound fell to a low of$1.5614 compared with $1.5846 in New York. 'In addition to a bigger margin of rate cut, Stevens' bearish comment on the world economy spawned speculation that the ECB and the Bank of England might be forced to implement strong easing action over a long period of time,' said Minoru Shioiri, senior manager of foreign exchange at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities.  Both the ECB and the BOE will hold their policy meetings on Thursday.  The ECB is believed to cut its policy rate by 50 basis points to 3.25%, while the BOE by the same margin to 4.00%.  Main events for the local markets Tuesday are NAAMSA new vehicle sales and the Reserve Bank's Monetary Policy Review.  A local bond trader said both are backward looking and he does not expect they will have a major impact on the bond market.  RMB analysts said in their morning report that the discussion around the document at the Monetary Policy Forum this evening could potentially provide some clues on interest rates.  Foreigners were net sellers of R183.621-million worth of South African bonds yesterday after net sales of R499.784-million worth of local bonds on Friday, Bond Exchange of South Africa statistics show.   Nominal cumulative volume was R39.778-million yesterday from R40.953-billion on Friday.
