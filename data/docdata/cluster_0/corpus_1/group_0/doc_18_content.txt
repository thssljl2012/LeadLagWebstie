 THE Australian economy is expected to record below trend growth for the rest of the year and into 2009, a survey shows.The Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index found Australia's annualised growth rate was 2.1 per cent in May, well below the long term trend of 3.9 per cent. The annualised growth rate of the leading index has fallen from 6.5 per cent six months ago. It is the sharpest six-month decline in the growth rate since February 2001, when the goods and services tax was introduced. The index, which measures the likely pace of economic activity three to nine months into the future, rose 0.1 index points in May to 255.6 points. Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said the result was 'entirely consistent with the prospect that the Australian economy can be expected to slow further through 2008 and into 2009''. 'Furthermore, that slowdown is broadly consistent with the RBA's (Reserve Bank of Australia) own forecasts and indicates that it will not need to further raise interest rates in this cycle,'' Mr Evans said. 'Despite another elevated inflation read from next week's print of the June quarter Consumer Price Index, we expect that the RBA will be confident to keep rates on hold for an extended period.'' The level of the coincident index rose 0.4 index points in May to 243.1 points. But the coincident index's annualised growth rate fell to 3.0 per cent, from 3.2 per cent in April, and remained well below the long-term trend of 3.8 per cent.
