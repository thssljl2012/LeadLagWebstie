 although some pared early losses as bargain hunters snapped up shares that had been thrashed over the past few sessions. Exporters such as Sony Corp. and Samsung Electronics ranked among the gainers, while banks such as Commonwealth Bank of Australia found buyers in Sydney. Japan's Nikkei 225 Average briefly crossed into positive territory in the afternoon before slipping back on worries about high crude-oil prices and the health of the U.S. economy. The benchmark average, which slid in the previous 10 sessions for its longest losing streak since 1965, recently fell 0.2% to 13, 264.54, after rising as high as 13,325.52. August oil futures soared to a record high of $144.44 a barrel recently in electronic trading, gaining as much as 68 cents.

In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 0.6% to 21,581.11 and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index lost 2.2% to 11,353.10. 'We may still see some declines today, but the market is going into the oversold region, according to some technical indicators, especially in large- capital stocks such as HSBC Holdings and local property stocks,' said Linus Yip, strategist at First Shanghai Securities. 'I'd expect them to stabilize in the near-term and probably see a rebound, if there is some good news.' The Shanghai Composite rose 1.3% to 2,685.98 and the Shenzhen All Share index soared 2.9% to 807.27, with both indexes coming off initial declines. In Seoul, the Kospi fell 1.1% to 1,605.90, while Australia's S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 shed 2.3% to 4,976, dropping below the 5,000-point mark for the first time since September 2006.

Regional detail Shares of some exporters recovered from their initial declines in Japan and South Korea, with Sony Corp. (SNE) rising 0.7% in Tokyo and Samsung Electronics Co. gaining 1.3% in Seoul. Some banks recovered in Sydney, with Commonwealth Bank climbing 1.6%. But losers overpowered gainers, with steel, shipping and airlines fronting the decline. Among steelmakers, shares of Nippon Steel Corp. (NISTY) sank 3.1% and JFE Holdings Inc. gave up 3.9% in Tokyo. Posco (PKX) slumped 5.8% and Hyundai Steel gave up 5.6% in Seoul, while Bluescope Steel tumbled 7.9% in Sydney. The drop in Hyundai Steel shares came after UBS downgraded them to neutral from buy, citing likely interest costs, and a moderation in construction activity and 'unexciting' profits in the second half of this year as reasons. Shipping firms also lost ground, with Nippon Yusen K.K. sliding 1.8% in Tokyo, while STX Pan Ocean Co. lost 0.9% in Seoul and 3.5% in Singapore. China Shipping Container Lines Co. slipped 1.4% in Hong Kong. Airline stocks fared poorly, with shares of Korean Air Co. losing 4.2% in Seoul and Virgin Blue Holdings shedding 2% in Sydney, while Singapore Airlines dropped 1.8% in Singapore. Cathay Pacific Airways (CPCAY) fell 0.7% in Hong Kong, extending losses a day after it issued a profit-warning, saying its half- yearly profit would be 'disappointing.' In a note to clients, Morgan Stanley advised long-term investors to 'stay with airlines that are well-capitalized, operate strong business franchises, and have healthy cash positions.' 'In the current high oil price environment, we believe airline bankruptcies are on the rise, and the surviving airlines will emerge stronger with increased market shares,' they wrote. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar bought 106.07 yen in Asia, compared with 106.115 late Wednesday.
