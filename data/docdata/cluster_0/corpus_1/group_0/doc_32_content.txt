 BUSINESS conditions have slumped to the lowest levels since the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, a survey shows.The National Australia Bank (NAB) survey found business conditions for the June quarter fell by seven index points to six points. It is the lowest index reading since the December quarter of 2001, when the business conditions index was minus-two points. NAB economist John Sharma said global financial market volatility and higher interest rates were affecting business conditions. 'We're affected by global events,' he said. 'This malaise started in the US and this sub-prime crisis has increased wholesale costs. 'Because of higher interest rates and the deterioration in financial conditions, costs of finance have gone up. 'This whole series of events is slowing down economic growth.' The poll of 900 firms with 40 or more employers also found that employment conditions had slumped to the worst level since late 2002. This measure of business conditions fell by five index points to six points, which was the same level as for the December quarter 2002. The trading conditions index dropped 10 points to seven points, while profits dived by six points to two points. Forward orders fell five index points to minus-one point.
