 THE share market closed in positive territory for the second consecutive day after strong gains from the banks following surge on Wall Street overnight spurred on by easing concerns about inflation.At the close, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was 30.4 points, or 0.62 per cent, higher at 4901, while the broader All Ordinaries gained 29.9 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 4977.4. At 4.15pm (AEST) on the Sydney Futures Exchange, the September share price index contract was 40 points higher at 4891, on a volume of 20,173 contracts. US stocks surged 2.5 per cent overnight, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average putting on 274.74 points, or 2.52 per cent, to close at 11,239.28 as falling oil prices sparked expectations that inflation could moderate. 'The big move by the US market last night, combined with some reasonably good news from the RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia) on the interest front potentially next year, was enough to spark the financials and drove a lot of the gains,' Macquarie Equities client adviser David Halliday said. 'The only thing that constrained our market was that the resources were so weak.' The retailers were mixed, with Woolworths gaining 74 cents to $25.00, David Jones adding 23 cents to $3.09, Harvey Norman putting on 10 cents to $3.11 and Wesfarmers shedding 33 cents to $32.09.
