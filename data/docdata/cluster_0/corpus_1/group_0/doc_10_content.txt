 Australia's biggest commercial credit check firm fears that surging borrowing costs will see many small businesses struggle to cope with higher debts for at least the next year.Australian Bureau of Statistics data out this week showed a 16 per cent jump in deposit and loan facility costs during the past financial year.Dun and Bradstreet chief executive Christine Christian said micro firms, in particular, were increasingly going to the wall as borrowing costs increased. 'We have seen more and more business debts being referred to collection agencies and we have seen a huge number of insolvencies and bankruptcies,' she said. 'With margins eroding, and wages pressures still relevant, we're probably going to continue to see this increase for at least another 12 months. 'If we can curb spending and keep inflation down, hopefully we'll get through this in the next 12 months but if this doesn't materialise, this could go on for longer.' In the June quarter alone, deposit and loan facility charges rose by 9.5 per cent, even outpacing the 8.7 per cent jump in petrol costs, consumer price index data showed.CommSec chief economist Craig James said the major banks were likely to increase their standard variable lending rates in coming months, independently of any move by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). '(The) banks may have to increase interest rates again because ... you have to respond to the global developments,' he said. Mr James said higher financial lending charges, as a component of September quarter consumer price index data, would make the RBA less inclined to raise the official cash rate. 'If you have a high inflation reading because of the global financial crisis, it doesn't make sense for the Reserve Bank to be jacking up interest rates,' he said. Australia's second biggest bank by market value, the National Australia Bank, on Friday announced an extra $830 million loss on its exposure to troubled US mortgage-backed debt securities.
