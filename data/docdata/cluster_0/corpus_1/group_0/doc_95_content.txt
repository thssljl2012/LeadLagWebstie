 Westpac will raise its mortgage rates by 0.14 percentage points to 9.61% on Thursday, in a move that will increase the burden on customers struggling under high interest rates and petrol prices at record levels.The increase makes Westpac the last of the five major banks to increase the cost of lending after St George kicked off the cycle of independent rate rises less than two weeks ago, blaming the higher cost of financing for the step.The banks' claims have been met with increasing scepticism by the Government and consumers who question the real cost to banks.The flurry of unofficial rate rises comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia kept the official rate on hold at a 12-year high of 7.25% in its July meeting.''Volatility in global funding markets continues to impact Westpac's average cost of funds,'' Westpac Group executive, consumer financial services, Peter Clare said in a statement.Westpac was widely expected to raise rates after Commonwealth Bank and ANZ both moved their rates higher on Friday and NAB raised its rates yesterday.The average of the five banks' increases is 15.6 basis points, bringing the average cost of a standard variable mortgage rate from the major banks to 9.62%. 'We continue to be very thoughtful in our approach of balancing the needs of our customers with the needs of our shareholders,'' said Mr Clare. The slowing pace of home sales suggests homebuyers are feeling the pinch of rising mortgage rates. Lending finance figures for May posted their largest annual fall in 16 years, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics in a release yesterday.Total lending finance, including personal, housing, commercial and lease borrowing, slumped by a seasonally adjusted 13.3% in the year to May. The slowdown is part of a trend the RBA noted in its July meeting minutes released today. 'Housing finance had weakened further, with sharp falls in April and May, based on preliminary estimates, and monthly housing credit growth had slowed to around 0.6%.' The slowdown has pushed clearance rates down in both Sydney and Melbourne, weighing down sales volumes as well, the central bank noted. The commercial banks' independent rate rises, along with the official changes to the cash rate, put mortgages at about 140 basis points higher than this time last year. Since then the price of petrol has soared, compounding the headaches of consumers trying to pay their bills. Petrol prices have increased by one-third over last year at this time, according to the RACV.The average price of a litre of petrol hovers around $1.60 per litre in Melbourne.czappone@fairfax.com.auBusinessDay
