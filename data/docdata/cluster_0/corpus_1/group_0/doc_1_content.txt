 SYDNEY, July 29 (Reuters) - Australian business conditions deteriorated sharply last quarter with sales, employment and profitability all suffering from tighter financial conditions and slumping consumer confidence, a survey showed on Tuesday.The National Australia Bank's (NAB) quarterly survey measure of overall business conditions fell 7 points in the second quarter to 6 points, the lowest reading since 2001. 'The combination of much tighter financial conditions, falling global equity markets and the global credit crunch has has continued to undermine confidence and activity levels,' said Alan Oster, NAB's group chief economist.NAB had already reported that its measure of business confidence fell 4 points to -8, the lowest reading since 1991 when the economy was just emerging from recession.The survey's measure of sales dropped a steep 10 points to 7 index points in the quarter to June, while profits dropped 6 points to 2 and employment fell 5 points to 6.Businesses expectations for the coming quarter and on a 12-month horizon were also downgraded markedly and firms cut back on investment plans.Sectors suffering included retailing and recreational &amp;amp; personal services, transport, property services and parts of manufacturing and construction.In contrast, business conditions in mining and business services remained relatively strong.Capacity utilisation eased further to 82.8 percent, well below last year's record rate of 84.2 percent. Some 64 percent of respondents reported that labour availability was a constraint on current output, compared to 70 percent in the first quarter.(Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by James Thornhill) . ngInteractive Investor brings you breaking news throughout the day to support your investment decisions.
