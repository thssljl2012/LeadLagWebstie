 WELLINGTON, July 28 (Reuters) - The New Zealand dollar NZD= steadied slightly above six-month lows on Monday, as investors ignored better-than-expected trade data and focused on the likelihood of lower interest rates.The kiwi has managed to hold its ground after tumbling nearly 3 percent last Thursday when the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut rates by a quarter point to 8 percent, but analysts say it's only a matter of time before the currency heads down further. 'With interest rates falling and set to fall further, the kiwi should remain on the back foot,' said ANZ-National Bank economist Philip Borkin, adding that the focus was now on how fast and by how much rates would fall. The kiwi was at $0.7436/40 at 0500 GMT, little changed from late local trade on Friday and compared with the six-month trough of $0.7387 hit last Thursday. Bank of New Zealand currency strategist Danica Hampton said she expected the kiwi to fall to $0.7000 by the end of the year and continue dropping to around $0.6500 by the end of 2009. 'If anything the risks are skewed in favour of currency falling more quickly and further than our current forecasts,' she added. In a statement on Thursday, the RBNZ said it expected to cut rates further to support an economy widely seen as already in a recession, provided the kiwi does not fall too sharply.All 17 analysts in a Reuters poll taken after Thursday's cut expected a further cut at the bank's next meeting on Sept. 11, with 13 of 17 forecasters expecting rates at 7.25 percent by the end of the year.With investors' focus fixed on the interest rate outlook, the New Zealand dollar showed little reaction to better-than-expected trade data released on Monday.Statistics NZ said a trade deficit of NZ$223 million ($165 million) was posted for June, smaller than the NZ$500 million forecast by economists. [nWEL000721]Building data for June is due on Tuesday but the National Bank of NZ's business sentiment on Thursday is likely to draw more attention as it will give the latest indication on the health of the corporate sector.
