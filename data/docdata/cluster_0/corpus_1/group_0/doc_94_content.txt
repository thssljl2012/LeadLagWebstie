On Thursday, Newcrest reveals its fourth-quarter production and Santos releases its second-quarter production details.But the highlight will be the second-quarter consumer price index (CPI) data on Wednesday.The Macquarie Group economics team said June quarter inflation data won't paint a pretty picture for the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), with inflation likely to remain above 4 per cent.'This is likely to keep the RBA vigilant, but is unlikely to raise any alarm bells, as the bank has already flagged that it expects inflation to reach 4.5 per cent,' they said in a note. 'It is already clear that activity is straining under the weight of tighter monetary conditions.'
