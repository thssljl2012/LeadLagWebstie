 (RTTNews) - Extending Tuesday's morning session's downtrend, the Australian dollar fell further against the euro, the greenback and the Japanese yen in early New York trading as traders continued to mull over RBA's decision to hold the interest rate at 7.25% in the morning.As widely expected, the Reserve Bank of Australia kept the overnight cast rate target unchanged at a 12-year high of 7.25% for a fourth straight month as a slump in stock markets, record gasoline prices and a drop in employment decrease consumer confidence and force companies to trim spending. The central bank last raised the benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point in March 2008, the fourth increase in seven months.Earlier today, the Australian Home Industry Association announced new home sales in Australia had declined 5.0 percent in May.In addition, a report from the Australian Industry Group/Pricewaterhouse Coopers revealed that the performance of the nation's manufacturing sector showed the first contraction in activity since January.

Most economists were forecasting a decline to 3 in the diffusion index.
