 LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Europe's leading indices continued to slide at midday, ahead of an expected weaker start on Wall Street as U.S. investors await key housing market data, with falls from European car manufacturers offsetting banking sector gains.At 12:07 p.m., the Dow Jones STOXX 50 was down 21.9 points, or 0.7 percent, at 3,365.6 and the Dow Jones STOXX 600 slipped 2.5 points, or 0.9 percent, at 275.22.On Wall Street, spread-bettors IG Index expect the Dow Jones Industrial Average to open around 42 points down, having closed up 29.9 at 11,632.4.The U.S. existing home sales figures are expected to continue their steady decline, with analysts looking for an annual rate of 4.94 million units in June, compared to 4.99 million last time.Investors also await the weekly U.S. jobless claims numbers, where the number of individuals filing first-time claims for unemployment is expected to have increased to 375,000 during the week ending July 19.On a more positive note, Amazon is likely to rise after the Internet retailer reported second-quarter earnings that more than doubled and easily topped analysts' expectations. It also raised its full-year revenue projections.Back in Europe, financial stocks were in demand after Credit Suisse posted better-than-expected second quarter earnings.The Swiss banking giant traced the gains to strength in its wealth management business amid negligible group-wide writedowns, as it unveiled significant cuts in its risk exposure since March.A Frankfurt-based trader said the promising numbers at the Swiss banking peer were positive for nearly all German financials, but especially those like Deutsche Bank, which are actively involved in trading.Credit Suisse shares gained 5.1 percent, Deutsche Bank was up 0.9 percent, Societe Generale added 1.4 percent, Barclays rose 1.4 percent, and Credit Agricole ticked up 1.6 percent.The latter was helped further by Morgan Stanley resuming coverage with an 'overweight' rating and 18 euros price target.Financials also received a fillip after Morgan Stanley upgraded its sector rating for European financials to 'in-line' from 'cautious'. It also raised London Stock Exchange to 'equal-weight' from 'underweight' on valuation grounds but said it prefers Deutsche Boerse. London Stock Exchange surged 6.4 percent, while Deutsche Boerse was 1.5 percent ahead.Lloyds TSB, meanwhile, lost 0.3 percent after Citigroup downgraded its recommendation to 'hold' from 'buy' as part of a UK banks note, in which the broker also cut target prices across the board, pointing to balance sheet worries.Also in the UK, troubled mortgage bank Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley jumped 10.0 percent after the Daily Telegraph reported that it has raised 2.5 billion of much-needed funding by successfully completing its first securitisation of the year.The DJ STOXX 600 Banks index added 0.7 percent, while, apart from banks, telecoms also made headway, with the DJ STOXX 600 Telecoms up 0.5 percent as Mobistar reported solid figures for the first half of 2008.The results for the first half of 2008 'were clearly stronger than anticipated', Rabo Securities analysts said. 'These results should be comforting', given the weak macro conditions and a recent profit warning from peer Vodafone, Nico Melsens at KBC said in a note to clients.Mobistar shares jumped 7.4 percent, while others in the sector also gained, with KPN up 0.7 percent, BT Group 0.6 percent higher and Belgacom rising 0.9 percent.Moving to the downside, car and car parts manufacturers made up the worst performing sector, with the DJ STOXX 600 index down 4.6 percent as investors shrugged off better-than-expected figures from Renault and instead focused on Daimler's scaling back of its 2008 EBIT guidance.Daimler announced a new 2008 EBIT guidance of 7 billion euros, below the automaker's old guidance target of earning more than the previous year's EBIT of 7.7 billion euros.Earlier in the session, Renault had ticked up after posting forecast-beating numbers, but the company's CEO accompanied the figures with comments that he sees no recovery in the European market in 2009 and expects China car market growth could be 5-10 percent rather than the 20 percent previously thought.Daimler plummeted 10.5 percent, BMW dropped 4.9 percent, Renault lost 5.6 percent, Peugeot fell 5.5 percent, and Volkswagen eased 3.7 percent. The oil &amp;amp; gas sector also helped drag European indices lower, as individual stocks tracked recent declines in the oil price.Oil is down more than $20 a barrel since hitting a record above $147 just weeks ago. A barrel of light sweet crude fell $3.98 to settle at $124.44 on the New York Mercantile Exchange Wednesday.The DJ STOXX 600 Oil &amp;amp; Gas fell back 2.3 percent, with Total down 2.3 percent, Royal Dutch Shell 1.8 percent weaker, Repsol YPF sliding 2.4 percent and Tullow Oil off 6.1 percent.On the economic front, investors were disheartened after euro zone services and manufacturing activity contracted sharply in July, sources said of a key survey.The euro zone Purchasing Managers Index for services slipped to a five-year low of 48.3 in July from 49.1 in June. Euro zone manufacturing activity also slumped, falling to 47.5 from 49.2 in June. Both figures were below expectations. holly.cook@thomsonreuters.com hco/cmrInteractive Investor brings you breaking news throughout the day to support your investment decisions.
