 Updating to correct an earlier version that misstated the Topix index's movement.HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Japanese indexes rebounded Monday afternoon, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 Average snapping out of a 12-day losing streak as investors looked for bargains in exporters such as Canon Inc. and banks like Mizuho Financial Group. The Nikkei 225 Average rose 1% to 13,364.93, after dropping as low as 13,169.55 earlier in the day. The gains came after the benchmark lost nearly 8.5% in the previous 12 sessions. The broader Topix index added 1.1% to 1,311.85. Trading volumes were thin in Tokyo in the absence of cues from U.S. markets, which were closed Friday for a holiday. The rest of the region was mixed, with Chinese stocks in Shanghai and Hong Kong rising sharply after Industrial &amp;amp; Commercial Bank of China and China Merchants Bank gave strong profit alerts last week. Beaten-down airline stocks rose on bargain buying. Banks led the drop in Sydney on persistent concerns about global credit markets. China's Shanghai Composite surged 4% to 2,776.28 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 1.4% to 21,715.41. Australia's S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 dropped 1.8% to 4,992.90 and South Korea's Kospi gave up 0.2% to 1,575.40. Castor Pang, strategist at Sun Hung Kai Financial, said the bounce in Hong Kong and Shanghai came on the back of 'oversold' stocks. 'Investors were expecting the (Chinese) central government to rescue the markets, but the government has refrained from interfering in the market,' said Pang. 'Whether the rebound can be sustained will depend on what investors do now. If they dump their shares on the bounce, the rebound will stop.' Singapore's Straits Times Index rose 0.8% to 2,916.63 and Taiwan's Weighted index added 0.6% to 7,271.17.

(CEA:CEANews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) surged 8.7% in Shanghai.
