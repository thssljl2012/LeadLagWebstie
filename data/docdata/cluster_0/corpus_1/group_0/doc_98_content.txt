  Households can draw some relief from early promising signs that inflation pressures are easing, suggesting official interest rates at least may not need to go any higher.Government data released today shows prices paid by manufacturers grew at a slower pace in the three months to June than the previous quarter, suggesting there is less pressure on business to pass on increased costs to consumers, economists say.They said Wednesday's consumer price index (CPI) for the June quarter may also not be as strong as forecast.The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said the producer price index (PPI) in the final stage of production rose 1.0 per in the June quarter.It had jumped 1.9 per cent in the March quarter, the largest increase in the series since it started in 1998.In the year to June, producer prices rose 4.7 per cent compared to 4.8 per cent in the year to March.Economists had forecast the June quarter PPI to rise 1.6 per cent, with an annual rise of 5.3 per cent. 'The lower PPI, downside risk to the CPI and comment from (RBA governor) Glenn Stevens last week that effectively said that interest rates can come down before inflation does provides further evidence that the easing cycle is closer than some people think,' TD Securities senior strategist Joshua Williams said.The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has indicated that it may have done enough to slow domestic demand through 12-year-high interest rates, which will constrain inflation over time.The quarterly rise in producer prices was largely the result of an 8.2 per cent increase in petroleum refining, a 3.1 per cent rise in meat and meat product manufacturing, a 2.0 per cent lift in non-building construction, and a 1.6 per cent rise in building construction.These were partially offset by a 7.3 per cent drop in some agriculture prices and a 6.4 per cent price fall in electronic equipment manufacturing.Still, today's data also showed that prices in the earlier stages of production accelerated sharply in the June quarter, a sign that reducing inflation pressures will remain a slow process.Prices at the intermediate stage of production jumped by 2.7 per cent in the quarter and by a large 3.5 per cent in the preliminary stage, both due to a 16.3 per cent surge in oil and gas extraction. 'This should maintain some upward pressure on the final stage PPI and the CPI in coming quarters and suggests the CPI is not going to return to the target band in a hurry,' ANZ economist Riki Polygenis said.The RBA does not expect inflation to return to the top of its two to three per cent target until June 2010.In the year to March, the CPI was 4.2 per cent.An AAP survey of economists taken before today's data forecast a 1.3 per cent increase in Wednesday's June quarter CPI for an annual rate of 4.3 per cent.Governor Stevens reiterated last week that CPI inflation could remain high in the coming few quarters because of the jump in oil prices.AAP
