 The Reserve Bank could cut interest rates as soon as next week - despite inflation heading for 5 per cent - but economists say it is a close call and September may be more likely.Some economists were picking the Reserve Bank to cut official rates three times by the end of the year, but then hold the rate at 7.5 per cent. Others suggested rates would drop to 6.75 per cent by early next year, pushing home mortgage rates down sharply.That would give some relief to borrowers now being squeezed hard in the wallet by rapidly rising petrol and food prices.Statistics New Zealand figures, issued yesterday, showed inflation at 1.6 per cent for the June quarter, with a turbo-charge from a 12.8 per cent rise in petrol prices, increasing the annual rate to 4 per cent.Westpac Bank said the Reserve Bank would not want to see a sudden US10 cent drop in the currency by cutting rates sharply by more than 100 basis points by December, as that would shoot petrol prices up to $2.45 a litre at the pump.Food prices were up 8.2 per cent in the year - the biggest leap in 18 years - with dairy product prices again rising sharply.But non-tradeable or domestic inflation appears to have peaked in the face of a weak economy, heading for deepening recession, and suggests rate cuts sooner rather than later.Domestic inflation was up 3.4 per cent in the year, down from 4.1 per cent a year ago.Deutsche Bank economist David Plank said this result indicated that domestic price pressures had peaked. With a weak economy in the first half of the year, the Reserve Bank could be more confident that domestic inflation would ease. 'We think this increased confidence will allow the bank to cut the official cash rate by 25 basis points [to 8 per cent] at next week's meeting,' Mr Plank said. But Bank of New Zealand economists said it would be brave of the Reserve Bank to cut rates so soon after such inflation figures.As well, September-quarter inflation would rise another 1.6 per cent, taking annual inflation to 5 per cent, well outside the Reserve Bank's target band, BNZ said.But with indicators suggesting the economy has stalled and is in a deepening recession, including gloomy business and consumer confidence and a dive in retail spending, a rate cut is now seen as just a matter of timing, economists say.ASB Bank chief economist Nick Tuffley expected the Reserve Bank to cut rates from 8.25 per cent to about 6.75 per cent by April next year, depending on what happened to the Kiwi dollar. 'That would put the official cash rate back to a neutral rate,' he said, and would neither push the economy up nor down.A 150-basis-point cut would push floating mortgage rates down, and would lower fixed rates out to about two years.
