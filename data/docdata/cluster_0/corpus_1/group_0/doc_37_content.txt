 LONDON - Gold slipped in Europe on Monday as the U.S. dollar held near a one-month high against a basket of currencies, denting the precious metal's appeal as an alternative investment, and oil prices languished.Sentiment is cautious ahead of key U.S. data releases later this week, especially Friday's non-farms payrolls data, which is expected to lend fresh direction to trade.Gold dipped to $910.00/911.00 (U.S.) an ounce at 0944 GMT from $918.80/920.30 an ounce late in New York on Tuesday, when it fell as low as $913.80 an ounce, its weakest since July 8. Gold is primarily taking its cue from currency movements and oil price movements, as well as the stock markets, said Barclays Capital analyst Suki Cooper. If we see some sharp moves there, we could see a pick-up in gold prices, but otherwise, ahead of Friday's data releases, we might see quite rangebound action. The dollar is holding near the one-month high it hit on Tuesday against a basket of currencies. Gold typically moves in the opposite direction to the greenback, as it is often bought as a hedge against currency weakness.The dollar has been boosted by a fall in oil prices and a rise in the equity markets, both of which are also pressuring gold.European shares rose on Wednesday, mirroring a strong session in Asia, amid strong results from industrials and cheaper oil.Traders will be closely watching the crude market later in the session, amid expectations prices could fall further after U.S. stockpile data is released at 1430 GMT. Prices have become increasingly vulnerable to oil price movements, which could see gold trade erratically throughout the day as investors watch oil, said Standard Bank analyst Manqoba Madinane.Oil is trading just above $122 a barrel, down around $25 from the record high it hit earlier this month.Platinum prices languished on Wednesday as the market feared the outlook for the global economy and soaring oil prices would threaten demand for cars.Around half of global platinum supply is consumed by carmakers, who use the precious metal in autocatalysts.Standard Bank cut its platinum price forecast on Wednesday, saying it now sees the metal trading at an average $1,750 an ounce in the fourth quarter and $1,675 in 2009, against previous forecasts of $2,050 and $2,105 respectively.The bank said while it had expected to see fresh power outages from electricity company Eskom over the South African winter, these had not materialised.Generating problems in the republic earlier this year helped push platinum prices to an all-time high.In other supply news, mining group Xstrata said it achieved record platinum output in the first half of 2008.Spot platinum was little changed at $1,740.00/1,760.50 an ounce from $1,735.50/1,755.50 late in New York  far off a record high of $2,290 hit in March.Among other precious metals, spot palladium was flat at $380.00/388.00, while silver slipped to $17.14/17.20 an ounce from $17.32/17.38.
