 The Reserve Bank has cast doubt on the argument by Australia's retail banks that global funding pressures were the reason for the fourth-round of independent interest rate hikes.The National Australia Bank, the second largest bank, became the latest as it increased its lending rate on Monday following the lead of CBA, St George and ANZ.In its July minutes, the RBA made special note that Australian banks had become more active in issuing overseas bonds to meet their financing needs and that the banks appeared well-funded at the moment.The Reserve Bank left official interest rates on hold at 7.25% at the July meeting and most economists expect rates to remain steady for the rest of the year.The central bank also emphasised that conditions in the domestic money markets, which are accessed by most of the banks, were relatively calm at the moment.''Members noted that the continued strong pace of bond issuance by Australian banks meant that they were funding beyond current needs and for next year,'' the minutes said.''The maturities of new bond issuance had lengthened and there were indications that spreads at issuance were now starting to narrow.''The retail banks had justified the fourth round of independent rate hikes this year by blaming continued high borrowing costs hurting profit margins.Treasurer Wayne Swan has demanded the banks explain their decisions to customers and said his bank switching legislation was now more important for Australian customers. Opposition leader, Brendan Nelson, said Labor needed to ''apply the blowtorch'' to the bank bosses to justify the moves.In the minutes, the RBA said credit markets were still unstable after several US investment banks and monocline insurers were downgraded by ratings agencies.''In money markets, however, conditions had not changed much overall over the past month; there had been some improvement in euro area markets,'' the bank said.''Money market conditions in Australia were little changed.''
