 SINGAPORE (Thomson Financial) - The continued surge in oil prices will start eroding the external payments position of Asian countries, with South Korea and India deemed as particularly vulnerable, and strongly undermines the growth potential of the region, a Barclays official said on Monday. 'Energy prices are driving a lot of what's going on,' he said. If oil prices were to pull back below $100 a barrel, then 'all will feel like a bad dream,' Barclays Capital head of emerging markets research Peter Redward told reporters at a briefing.Barclays has a bearish outlook on Asia, with an 'underweight' rating on all its asset classes, from equities to fixed-income and currencies.With oil prices above $100 a barrel, the only countries in Asia that will likely post trade deficits are Korea and India and this will exert pressure on the won and the rupee, said Redward.The U.S. dollar-won may hit 1,200 this year and the dollar-rupee may hit 46, he said. 'As oil prices go higher, the vulnerabilities of countries increase,' said Redward. Taiwan and Thailand may also start incurring trade deficits if oil prices jumped to between $150-160 a barrel.Rising energy costs have also been stoking fears inflation will continue to rise.Regional economic conditions may seem to echo those of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s but Redward said problems should not be as bad as then given countries' stronger balance sheets, lower leverage and flexible exchange rates to buffer some of the shocks.Barclays expects the U.S. economy to continue chugging along a growth path this year despite weak consumption, which will afford the Federal Reserve the ability to hike policy rates twice -- by 25 basis points from now until the end of the year -- to tame inflation.($1 = S$1.36)pearl.bantillo@thomsonreuters.comjb/zrInteractive Investor brings you breaking news throughout the day to support your investment decisions.
