  ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENTThe Reserve Bank of Australia believes its high interest rate strategy is working to cool domestic demand, suggesting the central bank may have done enough on rates, economists say.To the relief of many households, the central bank left its key interest rate unchanged at a 12-year high of 7.25 per cent for a fourth straight month after yesterday's monthly board meeting.The decision was widely expected by economists, although they were surprised by the RBA's softer tone in the accompanying statement.RBA governor Glenn Stevens said the inflation outlook remained a concern and would stay high in the short term, boosted by rising fuel prices.Mr Stevens said the rise in terms of trade would add substantially to national income and ability to spend and, at the same time, rising prices of oil and a range of other commodities were adding to global inflationary risks.But he said inflation should decline over time, provided demand continued to slow.''The evidence is that the tightening in financial conditions, in conjunction with other factors including rising fuel costs, is working to restrain demand,'' Mr Stevens said.''Indicators of household spending have recorded subdued outcomes over recent months, and credit expansion to both households and businesses has weakened significantly.''There had also been tentative signs of an easing in labour market conditions, he said.Financial markets wound back expectations of another interest rate rise on the statement, which also removed a threat of higher rates should rising inflation expectations begin to affect wage demands.ANZ co-head of Australian economics and interest rate research Sally Auld said the change in tone in the RBA's statement could suggest that the hurdle for another rate rise had been lifted a notch.However, Ms Auld said she still wanted to see this month's official inflation data before dropping her call for a rate rise in August.The annual rate of the consumer price index and underlying inflation were both around 4.2 per cent in the March quarter, well above the RBA's 2-3per cent inflation target.Some economists are predicting an even higher level when the June quarter inflation readings are released on July 23.Wizard Home Loans chairman Mark Bouris said the RBA's rate decision was a welcome reprieve for home owners experiencing mortgage stress.''Without being melodramatic, today's rate reprieve will mean many of these people can continue to keep their heads above water.''Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said it was essential the budget with its $22billion surplus was passed by the Senate to help put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates.''With the new Senate we will be negotiating hard to ensure that our legislative and budget package gets through,'' Mr Rudd said.The Federal Opposition lost control of the Senate as of yesterday, and the Government now needs to work with the Australian Greens, Family First and South Australian independent Nick Xenophon, who will hold the balance of power.
