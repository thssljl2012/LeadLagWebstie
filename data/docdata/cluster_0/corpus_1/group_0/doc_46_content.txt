 LONDON (ShareCast) - Oil groups and miners are the only cheery notes on another bleak day for Footsie. ENRC leads the miners with Cairn Energy and Tullow the best oil groups as the price of crude shoots up to $146 per barrel on Iran worries. Pub groups are taken a beating lead by Enterprise Inns while concern that the US mortgage could be facing a catastrophe if the mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac go under has undermined the bank sector, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays both suffer.
