 Shares were also dented after mortgage insurer Triad Guaranty (TGIC:TGICNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) was downgraded to junk status by Moody's Investors Service late Friday. MGIC Investment (MTG:MTGNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) fell 18% to $5.71, while PMI Group (PMI:PMINews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) dropped 13% to $2.05. Mortgage Insurance Companies of America (MICA), an industry group, said on Monday there were 67,967 defaults in May. So-called cures, which measure problems that have been resolved, were 40,687 last month. MICA reports data from MGIC, PMI, Triad and the mortgage insurance businesses of American International Group (AIG:AIGNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) , Genworth Financial (GNW:GNWNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) and Old Republic International (ORI:ORINews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) . Data from April showed a big jump in defaults to 73,880, but that was partly because one of the mortgage insurers changed the way it reported delinquencies. The company, which wasn't identified by MICA, had been under-reporting defaults before April. MICA said last month that the jump in April defaults was a one-time adjustment. However, the May data, unveiled on Monday, suggests stress in the industry remains as house prices continue to slump. In May 2007, there were 45,986 defaults. Because of the recent adjustment, May 2008 data is not directly comparable, but the report shows a 48% jump in defaults from a year earlier. Mortgage insurance helps home buyers who don't have enough money for a down-payment, which traditionally was 20% of the purchase price. As house prices have slumped rising defaults have sparked a surge in claims that have hit companies like MGIC and PMI hard. Triad, a smaller rival to MGIC and PMI, was cut to junk status by Moody's late Friday. The agency said the insurer didn't have enough capital to support an investment-grade rating. Triad said earlier in June that it would stop selling new policies and go into 'run-off.' That means the insurer will keep paying any future claims until all policies have expired, then shut down. Triad shares fell 4% to 97 cents. AIG shares fell 2.7% to $27 during morning trading. Genworth climbed 2.1% to $18.37 and Old Republic slipped 1.8% to $12. SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Mortgage insurers slumped again on Monday as an industry report confirmed that defaults remain high in the business.
