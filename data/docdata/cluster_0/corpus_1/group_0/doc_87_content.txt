  (RTTNews) - Inflation in Australia increased in the second quarter of 2008 by the largest annualized amount since Q4 of 1995.The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported Wednesday that its Consumer Price Index at the end of June was 4.5 percent higher than its level of one year earlier.The CPI rose 1.5 percent above its level of the preceding quarter.The overall inflation figures were higher than the increases forecast by most economists, which had pegged on quarter inflation at 1.2 percent and annual inflation of 4.3 percent.The top line inflation figure is above the Reserve Bank of Australia's 2 percent to three percent target range, and is likely to weigh against any reduction in interest rates by the RBA. Australia's benchmark interest rate remains at a 12-year high of 7.25 percent.The data from the bureau was released concurrently with inflation figures from the RBA. The central bank's core inflation rate, which removes volatile pricing items, increased 1.1 percent on quarter and 4.4 percent on year. The core rates are the RBA's preferred measurement when considering rate decisions.Last week, RBA Governor Glenn Stevens warned that inflation rates were likely to rise further before turning lower.The Statistics Bureau said the most significant price increases for the quarter came from deposit and loan facilities, up 9.5 percent, auto fuel up 8.7 percent, rents up 2.2 percent, hospital and medical services up 4.0 percent, home purchases up 1.0 percent, furniture up 3.1 percent and spirits up 6.1 percent.Offsetting price decreases included those for other financial services down 2.9 percent, fruit down 7.4 percent, vegetables down 6.5 percent, domestic holiday travel and accommodations down 2.0 percent and electricity down 1.4 percent.The Australian dollar rose to 97.22 U.S. cents shortly after release of the CPI data, up from 97.11 cents just prior to the report.
