'We're moving in the direction of Congress making the implicit guarantees of the agencies more explicit,' said Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management LLC, which oversees $70 billion of fixed-income assets. 'I think people should sell Treasurys and buy agency debt.' Foreign official investors have indeed continued buying Fannie and Freddie debt, Fed data shows.  Data also turned negative for the longer-dated notes after a government report on Wednesday showed consumer prices jumped by 5% in the year through June, the fastest in 17 years. Even excluding food and energy prices, a measure preferred by the Fed, prices rose 2.4%. Inflation erodes the value of fixed bond payments.

Fed funds futures showed a 43% chance of a quarter-percentage point rate increase as soon as September, down from 63% a week ago. The November futures contract indicates a 34% probability of a second rate hike to 2.50% at the Fed's late October meeting. A week ago, the chance of that big of a jump was 46%. Short-term debt may also be out of favor before the Treasury auctions more of the debt next week. The government is expected to say on Monday how much in two-year and five-year notes it will issue. Wrightson ICAP expects $31 billion in two-year debt to be sold on July 23 and $21 billion in five-year debt the following day.
