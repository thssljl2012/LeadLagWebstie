 THE dollar finished slightly weaker yesterday for the first time in a week, as the central bank boss hinted that interest rates might have peaked.The Aussie ended at US97.74c, down from Tuesday's US97.77c, its first weaker finish since July 9. The dollar moved between US98.15c and US97.48c and reached a 25-year high of US98.49c in overnight trading on Tuesday. That was its highest level since it touched US98.93c on January 17, 1983, when the exchange rate was fixed. The Aussie held above US98c around noon, but dived after Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens told a business lunch that demand and wage pressures were easing. The local unit slipped from US98.05c when Mr Stevens began his speech to US97.66c within 25 minutes. CMC Markets foreign exchange dealer Tim Waterer said the unit fell as Mr Stevens reaffirmed a widely held view that the next likely move was down. Mr Waterer said the sell-off was an overreaction. The Reserve Bank chief also hinted that official rates could be cut before inflation fell back to its 2-3 per cent target. 'You shouldn't be waiting until it's really obvious that inflation has gone all the way back down to where we'd like it to be before you can conclude you have to start doing something,' he said. The Reserve Bank is forecasting inflation -- now at 4.2 per cent -- will fall back to 3 per cent by mid-2010. Mr Waterer said the Australian dollar could test another 25-year high if US inflation data for June convinced traders the US Fed would not raise rates in 2008. The dollar finished at Y101.89, down from Tuesday's Y103.36, and at 61.44 euro cents, up from 61.31. The euro was at $US1.5908, down from $US1.5948, and at Y165.85 from Y168.59. The US dollar closed at Y104.25, down from Y105.71. The Australian bond market closed mixed after Mr Stevens hinted the Reserve Bank was more likely to cut rates. The yield on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was at 6.33 per cent, up from Tuesday's 6.31. The June 2011 bond was at 6.423 per cent, down from 6.462 per cent. The September 10-year bond futures contract was at 93.685 from 93.705, while the September three-year contract was at 93.585, up from 93.53. National Australia Bank research head Peter Jolly said the RBA governor was 'increasingly confident' inflation would fall. The 90-day bank bill rate closed at 7.78 from Tuesday's 7.82 per cent. The 180-day bank bill was at 7.91 per cent from 7.98 per cent. The Reserve Bank's trade weighted index was at 74, up from 73.9. It reached 74.2 at noon, its highest level since February 18, 1985.
