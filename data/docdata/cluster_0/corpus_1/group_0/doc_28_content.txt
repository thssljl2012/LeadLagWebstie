 Analysts are questioning how many more big write-downs are to come after ANZ became the latest bank to announce a major loss because of its exposure to volatile credit markets.Today ANZ more than doubled its provisions to $2 billion, blaming the credit crisis and slower Australian and New Zealand economies.At 2:45pm AEST, ANZ's share price had lost 9.8 per cent to $16.01, after falling by as much as 13.24 per cent to a low of $15.40 earlier in the session.Fat Prophets analyst Greg Canavan says the news that ANZ's higher provisions slash its earnings by up to a quarter has shocked investors. 'To get that type of magnitude of a fall from a bank such as ANZ has really knocked the wind out of the whole banking sector,' he said. 'I guess the other big question is how much more of this is to come? 'We're probably still relatively early days into the credit crisis and I think this just underscores the amount of pain the banks may have to go through over the next say 12 to 18 months.' Meanwhile, Treasurer Wayne Swan has tried to allay fears over the health of the Australian banking sector, saying it is in a position to withstand the volatility on the global credit market.Mr Swan says the banks are strong and well-regulated and have been transparent with the market about their financial position. 'As you know, these things change over time. But I'm advised by the regulators that they are satisfied that all of our banks have made full disclosure,' he said. National Australia Bank last week announced it was expecting to lose just over $1 billion on debt-backed investments that had turned bad.
