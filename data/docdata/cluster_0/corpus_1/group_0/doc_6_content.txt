 AUSTRALIAN stocks recorded their highest single-day rise in nearly four months to close up 3.5 per cent, led by the banking sector and gains among major resource stocks. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index smashed back through the psychological 5,000 point barrier, jumping 171.4 points, or 3.54 per cent, to 5,011.8. The broader All Ordinaries rallied 160.1 points to 5,075.4, increasing the value of the market by about $39 billion. At 1618 AEST, the September share price index futures contract was up 143 points to 4994 on volume of 26,976 contracts. ABN Amro Morgans Brisbane director of equities Bill Chatterton said local investors were making up for a pretty ordinary day on Friday when local stocks fell over one per cent despite a strong US lead. 'Emotion can drive the market down and it gets too cheap,'' Mr Chatterton said. 'Then people realise we're Australia and not the US and our economy's in pretty good damn shape.'' Market leader BHP Billiton added $1.55, or 4.23 per cent, to $38.20 and Rio Tinto gained $2.99 to $118.49. Fortescue Metals soared $1.01, or 12.44 per cent, to $9.13 after it trumpeted that it had reached the 'project completion' stage at its Cloudbreak mine in Western Australia's Pilbara region. Takeover target St George led the banks higher, putting on $1.29, or 4.91 per cent, to $27.55 as the company that wants to buy it, Westpac, surged 86 cents, or 4.26 per cent, to $21.06. The other banks posted similar-sized gains, with Commonwealth Bank up $1.55 to $43.35, National Australia Bank up $1.31 to $28.32 and ANZ up 59 cents to $18.80. Austock Securities senior client adviser Michael Heffernan said bargain hunters were coming off the sidelines. 'All the dead dogs are getting to their feet,'' he said. 'Everyone's a lot happier today. The US had a run of three days of pretty good performances and the banks are just galloping. ' Property trusts enjoyed some of the day's biggest gains, with Stockland leading the way with a 39 cent, or 8.55 per cent, gain to $4.95. GPT firmed 12.5 cents, or 8.01 per cent, to $1.685 and Lend Lease advanced 65 cents to $9.40. US equity markets were mixed on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 43.07 points to 11,489.73, while the broader Standard and Poor's 500 was virtually flat, up 0.23 points at 1,260.55 as Citigroup reported better-than-expected quarterly results. But technology stocks fell with the Nasdaq composite dropping 28.71 points, or 1.24 per cent, to 2,283.59. With AAPShare this article
