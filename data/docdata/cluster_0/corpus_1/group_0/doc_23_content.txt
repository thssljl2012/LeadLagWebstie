 * Shares log biggest one-day percentage rise in 3 months * Financial firms lifted by Citigroup's results * Commodity shares gain as oil rise above $131 a barrel(Adds details, comments)SYDNEY, July 21 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose 2.2 percent on Monday, the biggest one-day gain in three months, as a smaller-than-expected loss at a top U.S. bank helped soothe credit market worries, lifting financial firms.A rise in oil prices CLc1 to above $130 a barrel also lifted resource firms such as BHP Billiton Ltd (ASX: BHP.ax) , further boosting the market.However, fund managers said the strength in oil kept worries about rising inflation and slowing company profits at the forefront, making it hard for the market to see a sustained recovery.'It is too premature to assume that the bull market is coming back,' said Albert Hung, chief investment officer at Alleron Investment Management.'The domestic economy is slowing down and it is still early to see what its impact of profitability will be.
