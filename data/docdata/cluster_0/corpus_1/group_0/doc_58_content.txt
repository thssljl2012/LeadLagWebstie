 As a result, , the nation's second biggest bank, expects economic growth to slide next year as domestic demand eases.A NAB survey released yesterday shows business conditions for the June quarter fell by seven index points to six points.It is the lowest index reading since the December quarter of 2001, when the business conditions index was minus-two points, as the world economy recovered from the September 11 terror attacks in the United States.NAB economist John Sharma said global financial market volatility and higher interest rates were affecting business conditions. 'We're affected by global events,' he said. 'This malaise started in the US and this sub-prime crisis has increased wholesale costs. Because of higher interest rates and the deterioration in financial conditions, costs of finance have gone up. 'This whole series of events is slowing down economic growth.' TD Securities senior strategist Joshua Williamson said businesses and households were struggling as higher borrowing costs forced banks to raise their lending rates. 'We think the economy is going to weaken further,' he said. 'The extent of problems in the credit market are going to cause issues for businesses and households to obtain credit and that's going to help ease domestic expenditure.' The NAB surveyed 900 firms with 40 or more employees.The latest report was compiled after the major banks raised their standard variable interest rates in April independently of the Reserve Bank of Australia.The employment component of the business conditions posted its lowest reading since late 2002.Trading conditions and profits also fell in the three months to late June.The NAB expects economic growth will fall to 2.25 per cent by 2009.That figure is well down from gross domestic product growth of 3.6 per cent in the year to March.Business confidence expectations for the September quarter fell to their lowest level since the 1991 recession, the NAB said.NAB predicts the RBA will cut interest rates early next year, but TD Securities says rates will be eased before Christmas. - AAP
