 The lender's cash earnings-per-share are expected to fall 20%-25% over their levels in 2007, 'reflecting the impact of high provisions,' ANZ said in a statement. The bank said reserves set aside will likely be around A$1.2 billion ($1.15 billion) in the second half of 2008, compared with A$980 million in the first six months of the year. 'As the deterioration in global credit markets continues and the slowing of the global economy plays out in Australia and in New Zealand, there are flow-on effects for our commercial portfolios and to a lesser extent, the personal portfolios,' ANZ Chief Executive Mike Smith said in a statement. 'It is prudent in this difficult environment to continue to take a more conservative approach and further strengthen our balance sheet by increasing our collective provision to a peer-leading level of above one percent of credit risk weighted assets,' Smith added. ANZ's announcement comes after National Australia Bank Friday said it was setting aside an additional A$830 million to cover exposure to U.S. mortgages, and hit banking shares hard in Sydney.

Smith said that in spite of the 'legacy issues in institutional (business) and the change in the economic cycle,' the bank's underlying business continued to deliver 'solid performance.' ANZ said its profit before provisions this year will rise by around 8%, earning a cash profit of over A$3 billion. The bank also expects full-year dividend to be maintained at 136 Australian cents a share. HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Monday said its earnings are expected to decline this year as the bank will set aside more reserves to cover credit losses and a slowdown in the New Zealand and Australian economies.
