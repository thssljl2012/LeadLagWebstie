 The Reserve Bank (RBA) has announced that Australia's official interest rates will remain at 7.25 per cent for another month.The move had been widely anticipated by economists.Yesterday, RBA figures showed only a modest increase in lending during May, in another sign that higher interest rates were reducing borrowing.ANZ Bank economist Alex Joiner said he expected the figures would persuade the RBA to keep interest rates on hold for the time being.
