 Japan -  * Stocks extend fall and boost JGBs' safe-haven appeal* U.S. bank and economy worries support JGBs* BOJ keeps rates steady, as expected, sees slower growthTOKYO, July 15 (Reuters) - Japanese government bonds climbed on Tuesday, pushing the benchmark yield down to a three-month low as worries over the U.S. financial sector sparked a stock market sell-off, reinforcing expectations that the Bank of Japan will hold interest rates steady for a while.Futures extended gains to two-month highs as Japanese banks bought cash bonds, adding to their earlier lift by speculators who took their cue from Monday's jump in U.S. Treasuries, traders said.'Credit worries as well as growing expectations that a deteriorating U.S. housing market and consumption will eventually drag down the Japanese economy are adding to the jump in JGBs,' said Akito Fukunaga, a fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse.The BOJ left interest rates unchanged at 0.50 percent on Tuesday, as expected, and said Japan's economy is slowing further on rising prices of energy and raw materials.The central bank also said the economy is likely to grow much less than expected in the current and next fiscal years, while price pressures will rise more than the bank had forecast in its half-yearly economic outlook report issued in April.September futures climbed 0.36 point to 136.43 after reaching as high as 136.79, their highest since early May.The benchmark 10-year yield was down 3 basis points at 1.550 percent, after hitting a three-month low of 1.530 percent.The five-year yield slipped 1.5 basis points to 1.105 percent after hitting a 2-1/2-month low of 1.075 percent.The two-year yield edged down half a basis point to 0.760 percent off a two-month low of 0.755 percent hit earlier in the session.BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa is to speak at a news conference later in the day, with his comments likely to come out some time after 0700 GMT.OVERSEAS FOCUSSome investors felt that JGBs have risen too quickly as the 10-year yield has fallen more than 36 basis points since it struck an 11-month peak of 1.895 percent in mid-June.As the yield approaches the psychologically important 1.5 percent level despite a lack of new domestic factors to encourage buyers, investors are growing more hesitant, analysts said.'The JGB market has risen enough for now, although it may stay volatile in the short term as investors try to digest factors linked to the U.S. rescue plan for mortgage finance firms,' said Chotaro Morita, chief-fixed strategist at Barclays (nyse: BCS -  news  -  people ) Capital.The U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve offered emergency cash to troubled mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae (nyse: FNM -  news  -  people ) and Freddie Mac (nyse: FRE -  news  -  people ) on Sunday, and the Treasury also said it would buy shares in the companies to shore up investor confidence if necessary.But shares of major U.S. banks plunged on Monday amid fears about the sector's stability after regulators seized IndyMac Bancorp (nyse: IMBPR -  news  -  people ) on Friday, knocking Asian shares down.The Nikkei share average fell 2 percent on the day to a 3-A month closing low.Investors are paying close attention to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee later in the day to see how the latest developments affect his views on monetary policy and the U.S. economy.Since the JGB market has been largely steered by overseas factors, analysts said they will watch the reaction of U.S. Treasuries to determine whether JGBs can sustain their sharp gains.(Additional reporting by Rika Otsuka; editing by Sophie Hardach)Copyright 2008 Reuters, Click for Restriction'); //--&gt; News Headlines   More From Forbes.com   Special ReportsRelated Business TopicsStarting A Small BusinessSmall Business LoansTrading CenterBrought to you by the sponsors belowCEO Book ClubAuthor Q &amp;amp; ABook ReviewDavid K.
