 SYDNEY, July 28 AAP - The Australian stock market has finished the day in the red with the banks tumbling after  Ltd forecast its annual earnings to fall by up to a quarter due to the impact of the global credit crisis.At 1615 AEST the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 48.4 points, or 0.97 per cent, to 4922.1 while the broader All Ordinaries dipped 39 points, or 0.78 per cent, to 4989.9.The September share price index futures contract fell 60 points to 4922 on a volume of 26,331 contracts.CMC Markets senior dealer Matt Lewis said financial stocks took the brunt of the day's losses, with the sector index down 3.95 four per cent. 'Obviously it is a negative start to the week, and really it's the financial sector pulling the market down,' he said. 'We saw some pre-result commentary by ANZ, and it was negative, ... and the other banks have followed suit lower.' ANZ flagged a $1.2 billion second half provision on bad debt and said fiscal 2008 year cash earnings per share were expected to fall by between 20 and 25 per cent.Its shares dropped $1.94, or 10.93 per cent, to $15.81 - its lowest close since September 2001.It was also its worst one-day fall since since October 20, 1987, when the stock lost 8.74 per cent.Other big banks were dragged lower with Commonwealth Bank of Australia down $2.15, or 4.97 per cent, to $41.10, NAB losing 76 cents, or 2.86 per cent, to $25.80 and Westpac dipping $1.76 cents, or 7.97 per cent, to $20.33.Westpac's takeover target St George Bank slid $2.41 cents, or 8.42 per cent, to $26.20.The warning from ANZ today comes after NAB on Friday announced it would book an extra $830 million provision on a portfolio of securities linked to US mortgage debt.Oil related stocks also fell, following a fall in the price of crude in New York on Friday.Light, sweet crude for September delivery fell US$2.23 to settle at US$123.26 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 'Oil also continues its dive, adding to the negativity,' Mr Lewis said. Woodside lost $1.96, or 3.75 per cent to $50.25, Santos dropped 31 cents, or 1.78 per cent, to $17.09, but Oil Search inched up eight cents to $5.51.Mr Lewis said the materials sector was the only bright spot on the day with both BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto gaining.Mining giant BHP grew $1.08 cents, or 2.93 per cent, to $38.00, Rio Tinto added $4.80, or 4.22 per cent, to $118.60 and bauxite miner Alumina found eight cents at $4.46.National carrier Qantas Airways said it is trading well as it looked to reassure the market after its chief executive Geoff Dixon stepped down.
