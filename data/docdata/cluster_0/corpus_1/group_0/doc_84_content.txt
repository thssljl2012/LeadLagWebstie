 SYDNEY, July 2 (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of Australia's index of commodity prices jumped 7.9 percent in June as huge increases in coal and iron ore were accounted for early.The June increase follows a rise of 7.0 percent in May and a 9.4 percent surge in April, reflecting agreed increases in contact prices for coal and iron ore which have yet to fully show up in actual export prices.The RBA said preliminary estimates for these commodities had been incorporated into the index for April, May and June which assumed about three-quarters of the anticipated total increase in prices.In special drawing rights (SDR) terms the commodity index rose 7.9 percent in June to a record high of 256.0. Measured in Australian dollars, the index rose by 7.2 percent to another record of 179.7.The largest contributors to the rise in June were increases in the prices of coking coal, iron ore, thermal coal and wheat. The prices of nickel, lead and zinc fell.Coal and iron ore are Australia's two biggest export earners and analysts have estimated the price increases could add some A$45 billion ($43 billion) to A$55 billion to export earnings in a single year, essentially wiping out the country's trade deficit.That would also represent a major boost to Australia's income from profits, wages, dividends and tax receipts, helping cushion the economy in the face of higher interest rates and rising living costs.($1=A$1.05)(Reporting by Wayne Cole) . ngInteractive Investor brings you breaking news throughout the day to support your investment decisions.
