 HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Asian markets rallied Wednesday as financials such as Mizuho Financial Group and HSBC Holdings were spurred by easing concerns about the well-being of U.S. banks, while transportation stocks advanced after crude-oil prices fell sharply. Mumbai shares soared in early trading a day after the ruling coalition won a confidence vote in the lower house of the Parliament, ensuring its survival and paving the way for the government to press ahead with a civilian nuclear-trade agreement with the U.S. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average climbed 1.4% to 13,375.01 and the Topix index added 1.8% to 1,311.44. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 2.2% to 23,017.34 and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index climbed 2.8% to 12,788.46. Australia's S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 rose 2.8% to 5,146.20 and South Korea's Kospi advanced 2.2% to 1,595.80, while New Zealand's NZX 50 index jumped 2.3% to 3,215.06. 'Today, it's just like everyone is starting to feel a little more positive,' said Lucinda Chan, division director at Macquarie Equities Research in Sydney. 'As a whole, the markets are doing well on the back of banks. Wachovia results were disastrous, but it didn't really matter because people are of the view that the worst is really factored into the market.' China's Shanghai Composite wavered between positive and negative zones, and was recently up 0.1% at 2,847.58. Elsewhere, Singapore's Straits Times index advanced 2% to 2,947.09 and Taiwan's Weighted index jumped 3.4% to 7,305.02. In Mumbai, the Sensitive Index, or Sensex, jumped 4.7% to 14,759.59 in the early minutes. In a note to clients, ABN Amro analyst Irene Cheung said the government's victory in the confidence vote raised hopes it could revive reforms, including raising the foreign ownership cap in the financial sector. 'However, we note that this change has come at a time when the global and banking environment is negative, capital is scarce and much more costly than before,' said Cheung. 'We see this as a short-term reprieve, and not a turnaround over the longer term.' Financials on fire In Tokyo, shares of Mizuho Financial Group (MFG:MFGNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) (JP:8411: news, chart, profile) climbed 4.7%, Citigroup Inc. (JP:8710: news, chart, profile) (C:CNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) soared 10% and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFJY:SMFJYNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) (JP:8316: news, chart, profile) advanced 4% in Tokyo. The rise came after Wachovia Corp. (WB:WBNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) shares spiked as much as 27% overnight on Wall Street. The rise came although Wachovia reported nearly $9 billion in quarterly losses, after the lender said it wouldn't dilute shareholders' equity, and a Deutsche Bank analyst said the quarterly performance 'should mark a bottom' for the bank. Wilson Wong, analyst at Taifook Research, noted in a report that Wachovia was the only one missing market estimates among the five major U.S. banks. 'That should help ease concern about the troubled U.S. financial sector, even though most of the worries aren't expected to fade anytime soon,' Wong wrote. Referring to Hong Kong stocks, he added that fresh trading ideas were lacking in the local market, and investors were likely to adopt a 'wait-and-see approach until they see clearer directions in the China and the U.S. markets.' In Sydney, National Australia Bank (AU:NAB: news, chart, profile) (NABZY:NABZYNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) advanced 4.9% and Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AU:CBA: news, chart, profile) added 3.3% in Sydney, while Kookmin Bank (KB:KBNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) gained 3.3% in Seoul. In Hong Kong, HSBC Holdings (HK:5: news, chart, profile) (HBC:HBCNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) climbed 1.9%. Earlier in the day, Commonwealth Bank said it was in discussions with Royal Bank of Scotland (UK:RBS: news, chart, profile) to acquire ABN Amro Australia Holdings Pty. The announcement came a day after NAB announced it had withdrawn from talks to acquire ABN Amro Australia. Regional detail The region's transportation stocks also made advances, with Honda Motor Co.

Shares of Toyota Motor Corp. (TM:TMNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) (JP:7203: news, chart, profile) rose 0.4%, underperforming other automobile stocks, after the Nikkei business daily reported that it has slashed its 2008 worldwide group-sales target to lower 9.5 million unit range, down from the previously targeted goal of 9.85 million cars and trucks.  September crude-oil futures fell $3.40 to $128.42 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange Tuesday, when the August contract expired. The new front-month, September contract recently slipped as much as two cents to $128.40 a barrel in electronic trading. Gains in the transportation sector were countered by losses in energy-related stocks. Shares of oil producer Inpex Holdings (JP:1605: news, chart, profile) dropped 3.6% and commodity trader Marubeni Corp. (JP:8002: news, chart, profile) (MARUY:MARUYNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) shed 1.4% in Tokyo.
