 But most indexes ended with weekly gains, on advances in the early part of the week as investors covered short positions on signs global markets were stabilizing. Chinese coal stocks such as Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. were hit hard for the second day in a row after Beijing reportedly imposed controls on coal prices. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average fell 2% to 13,334.76 and the broader Topix index lost 2.6% to 1,298.28. The Nikkei gained more than 4% during the week. Australia's S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index stumbled 3.4% to 4,970.50, with National Australia Bank (AU:NAB: news, chart, profile) (NABZY:NABZYNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) tumbling 13.5% after the lender jolted investors by saying it will make a provision of A$830 million ($805 million) on its exposure of A$1.2 billion to securities linked to U.S. mortgage assets.  'I don't see why analysts couldn't have questioned [NAB's exposure to CDOs] prior to this,' said Stuart Smith, a private client adviser at Bell Potter Securities in Brisbane. 'NAB is very much under the microscope as all banks will be, and until the 13th of August, when CBA reports its results, we're just going to stagger around at these levels, I would think.' 'I wouldn't encourage clients to come in blindly and buy the four (top) banks at this point at all,' Smith added. The announcement also hurt other financial shares, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AU:CBA: news, chart, profile) losing 6.8%, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZBY:ANZBYNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) (AU:ANZ: news, chart, profile) skidding 8.7% and Macquarie Group (AU:MQG: news, chart, profile) (MCQEF:MCQEFNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) shrinking 5.5%. Standard &amp;amp; Poor's Ratings Services lowered its ratings outlook for NAB to negative from stable after the announcement. 'Although we expect the bank to remain profitable in the second half of fiscal 2008 and that the large provision is a one-off event, the negative outlook reflects the risk of further increases in credit costs in the next 12 months,' S&amp;amp;P analyst Sharad Jain wrote in a statement. Financials in focus Financials also dropped elsewhere, reacting to an overnight sell-off on Wall Street, as well as concerns that rising inflation would lift interest rates and crimp growth in lending. In Tokyo, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (JP:8306: news, chart, profile) (MTU:MTUNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) shed 5.4% and Mizuho Financial Group (MFG:MFGNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) (JP:8411: news, chart, profile) skidded 8.2%. In Seoul, Samsung Securities lost 3.3% and Korea Exchange Bank gave up 2.9%, HSBC Holdings (HK:5: news, chart, profile) (HBC:HBCNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) fell 1% in Hong Kong and DBS Group Holdings (DBSDY:DBSDYNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) shed 2.2% in Singapore afternoon trading. In Mumbai, concerns that the central bank may hike its lending rates at a policy meeting next week weighed down financials. By late afternoon, shares of ICICI Bank (IBN:IBNNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) lost 8.5% and HDFC Bank (HDB:HDBNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) skidded 7%. In a note to clients, Credit Suisse analysts said inflation in Asia 'should peak in the next 3-5 months.' They listed banks in China, Singapore and Hong Kong as their favorites in spite of their 'massive out-performance' to date, as they were likely to manage inflation better without increasing rates aggressively. Rest of Asia In Mumbai, the Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell 3.2% to 14,305.17 in afternoon trading. Among other benchmarks, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 1.5% to 22,740.71 and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index declined 2.6% to 12,421.67. China's Shanghai Composite lost 1.6% to 2,865.10, after rising 2.6% in the previous session. HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Asian markets suffered steep losses Friday, with National Australia Bank stock plummeting in Sydney after the lender said it will provide more for exposure related to U.S. mortgages, while Mizuho Financial Group shares shrank mirroring an overnight sell-off on Wall Street.
