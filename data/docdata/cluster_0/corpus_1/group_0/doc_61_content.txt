 Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan says retail banks need to justify their mortgage rate actions to working families.The country's largest home lender - the Commonwealth Bank - today announced it was raising its standard variable mortgage rate by 0.14 per cent to 9.58 per cent from Monday.The move follows similar rate actions by St George last Friday and BankWest mid-week.I acknowledge the pressures placed on borrowing costs as a result of the global credit crunch, but banks do need to justify their actions to working families, Mr Swan said.As I have been saying for some time, these unofficial rate rises come at a time when families are already hurting from skyrocketing global oil prices and eight interest rate rises in just over three years.Mr Swan conceded that banks make their own commercial decisions on these matters.But I'd remind them that hard-pressed families will reward banks that provide relief when it's possible, not just increases, he said.Now is the time for families to look for a bank that can best shield them from the increased cost of borrowing flowing from the US sub-prime crisis.Opposition Leader Brendan Nelson said Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and his government needs to put a blowtorch on the banks to explain their actions.We've had two official rates rises from the Reserve Bank of Australia ... but the banks are increasing their interest rates under Mr Rudd but I don't remember them doing that under (former treasurer Peter) Costello, Dr Nelson told reporters in Launceston, Tasmania.Mr Rudd's got to put the blowtorch on them to do this, explain to Australians why, with such huge profits, are they further increasing interest rates.
