  By Peter HutchisonA miserable week for job losses was made worse yesterday by the news of a further 770 cuts across Britain. More than 3,800 jobs have been shed in the past seven days as UK businesses struggle to cope with the economic slowdown, a housing market slump and soaring energy costs. Kier became the latest housebuilder and construction services group to announce it was cutting staff. In a trading update, the company said it planned to axe 350 jobs in its residential division - a 60pc cut in the headcount - to reduce costs. 'Conditions for our property business have continued to deteriorate over the past few months as yields have continued to shift upwards and occupier demand has slowed,' the company said in a statement.The world's biggest chemical company, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, said it planned to shut down its two plants in Teesside, leading to the loss of 200 jobs - representing 22pc of its local workforce.The group said rising energy prices had made the 'economics of the plant untenable' and they will close by the end of the year.The Finnish supplier of packaging to McDonald's, Huhtamaki Oyj, said it would cut up to 160 positions, or 39pc of its British workforce, to cope with rising energy prices. A total of 90 people will go at its Gosport base in southern England and 70 in Portadown, Northern Ireland.In further bad news for Ulster, glass manufacturer Toughglass said 60 jobs - 55pc of its workforce - will be lost at its Kilkeel plant as it shuts unprofitable operations and focuses on its profitable automotive and architectural glass divisions.A spokesman said Toughglass had been hit by the downturn in the construction market and increases in electric, raw material and fuel costs have made the group uncompetitive in its retail sectors compared with lower-cost overseas rivals.Earlier this week, Barclays announced plans to cut 1,800 IT jobs in Britain and move them overseas, HBOS said 650 positions would be axed over the next 18 months, digger maker JCB announced plans to cut 550 jobs across Britain, and Spire Healthcare, formerly BUPA Hospitals, said 103 jobs will go.
