'The NAB news coupled with the fact that the US market was off nearly 300 points has absolutely smashed the local market,'' Mr Foulsham said. 'We've seen a lot of mixed selling of NAB: we've seen people selling out of longs because they are concerned NAB might have a skeleton in the closet and some people were thinking it was an overreaction and were buying into the stock. 'At this stage, it is a provision, not a write-ff. 'But people's concern is that there is worse to come and that the bank could have some substantial losses that they are foreshadowing. 'The other possibility is that this is only the first stage of their provisions and there could be more of this stuff to come. 'It's had a flow-on effect to the other banks.''
