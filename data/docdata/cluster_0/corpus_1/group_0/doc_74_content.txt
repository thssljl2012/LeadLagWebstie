 THE Australian share market ended the day on a high note, led by the banks after investor confidence returned following a rally overnight on Wall Street. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index finished the day 89.2 points, or 1.84 per cent, higher to 4936.7 while the broader All Ordinaries climbed 85.4 points, or 1.73 per cent, to 5008.7. The September share price index futures contract was up 68 points to 4895 on a volume of 19,930 contracts. US equity markets firmed on news that Merrill Lynch was dumping distressed mortgage assets and raising fresh capital, which helped bring buyers off the sidelines and provided a positive lead for local markets. The Australian financial sector gained 3.3 per cent. The Big Four banks moved higher, with Westpac rising 73c, or 3.61 per cent, to $20.94, ANZ finding 57c, or 3.67 per cent, to $16.10, Commonwealth Bank adding $1.06, or 2.7 per cent, to $40.39 and National Australia Bank adding 68c, or 2.74 per cent, to $25.46. St George Bank added $1.03, or 4.01 per cent, to $26.71. The investment banks also gained, with Babcock &amp;amp; Brown up 19c at $6.77 and Macquarie Group jumping $2.85, or 5.88 per cent, to $51.35. Bell Potter senior adviser Stuart Smith said local banks were stronger but he was not impressed with the 'false rally' on low trading volumes. 'I think this is a bit of a sucker rally. The banks are going to finish strongly on the day but I have my doubts still because I think there is still some bad news to come,' he said. 'Until we are sure that the banks have no more surprises, we will see this volatility continue.' The big miners gained with BHP Billiton increasing $1.01, or 2.64 per cent, to $39.26. Rio Tinto added $2.35, or 1.97 per cent, to $121.50 after announcing it would invest $US2.15 billion ($2.3 billion) on expansion of an iron ore mine in Brazil. Macarthur Coal posted an increase in quarterly coal sales after an easing in shipping congestion and increased usage of stockpiles allowed it to overcome a drop in production. It ended up 40c, or 2.71 per cent, at $15.15. Aristocrat Leisure took a beating, falling more than 20 per cent to its lowest close in four years after forecasting a 44 per cent decline in interim net profit for 2008 at around $70 million, or 15.4c a share. Aristocrat shares ended down $1.23 at $4.85. News that regional pay-TV operator Austar United Communications posted a first-half net loss of $7.6 million wiped 8.5c off its share price to $1.17. Energy producers were mixed on a falling oil price, with Santos up 22c to $17.82, Oil Search dipping 15c to $5.50 and Woodside steady at $51.77. Gold producers went south, with Newcrest off 90c to $28.50 and Newmont steady at $5.09. Lihir Gold fell 8c to $2.81 on a drop in output in the quarter but held the year's production guidance of more than 850,000 oz. The retail sector was mixed, with grocery giant Woolworths losing 28c to $25.04, Coles owner Wesfarmers adding 33c to $34.09 and upmarket retailer David Jones finding 3c to $3.33.
