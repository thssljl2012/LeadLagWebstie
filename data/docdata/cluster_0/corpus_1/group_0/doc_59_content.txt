 HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Asian markets were a mixed bag Friday, also ending the week on a similar note. After a roller-coaster ride, indexes in Hong Kong, Australia and South Korea ended firmly higher as resource stocks tracked a rebound in crude-oil prices. Japanese stocks declined on weakness in automobile and airline shares, also ending the week in the red. Indian shares fared the worst, with Infosys Technologies (INFY:INFYNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) taking a tumble in spite of a better-than-expected quarterly performance, on uncertainty related to U.S. clients' information technology budgets.  Analysts said there were signs investors were turning less bearish after sharp recent declines. 'I think there is a lot of good value around. It's almost like a child in a toy shop, there are so many good things around,' said Michael Heffernan, senior client adviser at Austock Stockbroking in Melbourne. Heffernan said Wall Street would continue to influence local stocks, but added the U.S. markets were likely 'into the last quarter of a four-quarter game. I am a bit more upbeat about the American situation than some of the others.' Referring to the Hong Kong market, analysts at ICEA Securities wrote in a note that there were signs the 'bears are no longer dominating the market.' 'We continue our optimism over the July market. Among the (big capital stocks), mainland properties and banks remain our top choices,' they added.
