 THE dollar opened weaker today, after reaching a 25-year high overnight, as a better than expected US business conditions survey helped the American currency recover.At 7am AEST, the dollar was trading at $US0.9584/88, down from yesterday's close of $US0.9643/45. Overnight, the dollar traded between a low of $US0.9553 and a 25-year high of $US0.9668. This was the domestic unit's strongest level since it closed at $US0.9689 on February 17, 1983 during the days of a fixed exchange rate. The dollar reached its historic high shortly before 1900 AEST last night, after ending the local session at its firmest level since early 1983. A less dire than expected US business survey result then helped push the local currency to its overnight low soon after 1am AEST. The Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which measures business conditions in the industrial states of Illinois, Michigan and Indiana, rose by 0.5 index points to 49.6 in June.The result was better than market forecasts of 48 points, but it was still the fifth consecutive reading below 50, which meant business conditions were contractionary. Deutsche Bank foreign exchange strategist John Horner said the US dollar recovered against the euro overnight, which helped weaken the dollar. 'We saw the US dollar recover across the board overnight, that's really been the driving force,' he said. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is holding its monthly board meeting today. Economists expect the central bank to leave interest rates on hold at 7.25 per cent for the fourth month in a row when it announces its decision at 2.30pm AEST.Mr Horner said the RBA would be unlikely to change its tone from the June board meeting minutes. 'While they have a tightening bias, the hurdles to act are higher,' he said.
