 The Reserve Bank of Australia has issued new data on consumer credit, with a decline in the rate of growth. The figures show a fall to 8.8% in May 2008 from 16.2% the year before. In the US, credit card provider American Express is also feeling the impact on consumer spending by the global credit crisis, which is affecting Australia's major banks as well. They are forced to raise their interest rates to account for the higher price of borrowing on the wholesale money market. Citigroup expert Craig Williams warns that bank stocks will become negatively affected. On 22 July 2008 ANZ Banking shares closed $A0.73 lower at $A18.07
