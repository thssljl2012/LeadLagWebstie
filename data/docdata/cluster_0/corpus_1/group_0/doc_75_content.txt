 THE prospect of badly needed interest rate relief has been dashed by the highest inflation figure in 12 years, economists say.Although rates might not come down just yet, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) was not likely to raise rates either.This was despite today's annual headline inflation rate of 4.5 per cent in the June quarter - the largest annual increase in twelve and a half years.Consumer Price Index (CPI) headline inflation rose 1.5 per cent in the June quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said today.The result was above market forecast and higher than the 1.3 per cent in the March quarter. ''We expect no change in interest rate settings in August,'' CommSec chief equities economist Craig James said. ''Tight financial conditions are working to slow the economy, leading to lower inflation readings in coming quarters.''The largest increase in prices was in financial and insurance services, which jumped 3.8 per cent in the quarter and 9.9 per cent over the past 12 months.That price surge partly reflected the commercial banks' decision to lift their borrowing rates independently of official increases by the RBA, in response to the global credit crunch.Transport, which incorporates fuel, was one of the larger components of the CPI and it was up 3.1 per cent in the quarter for an annual pace of 6.9 per cent.Rents and health costs were also higher, while food prices dipped 0.1 per cent in the quarter due cheaper fruit and vegetables.The RBA focuses on the underlying measures of inflation to determine monetary policy settings. The underlying measure - the weighted median and the trimmed mean - exclude volatile prices from the CPI calculation.In the June quarter, underlying CPI inflation came in at 1.1 per cent, in line with market expectations. This translated into an annual increase of 4.4 per cent, which was a near 17-year high and above the RBA's forecast of 4.25 per cent.It was the fourth consecutive quarter when the average of the underlying measures came in above the RBA's target inflation band of two to three per cent.RBC Capital Markets senior economist Su-Lin Ong said the RBA would continue to tolerate inflation remaining high, given signs the economy was slowing. ''It is the activity data that are more important than the inflation numbers for the policy debate at present,'' Ms Ong said.Ms Ong said the RBA was likely to stay on hold until the second half of next year, provided growth stayed weak.RBA governor Glenn Stevens last week said the chances of keeping inflation low over the medium term were ''good''. Recent private sector surveys show business operating conditions had declined to the worst levels in six and a half years, while consumers were at their most pessimistic since January 1992. ANZ Banking Group economist Riki Polygenis said it was too early to say inflation had peaked, given the stimulus to the economy expected in the second half of calendar 2008. ''There's a risk that the terms-of-trade boost and the tax cuts could pre-empt a rebound in economic activity later in the year, particularly if petrol prices ease or financial conditions stabilise,'' Ms Polygenis said.The board of the RBA, which has left interest rates unchanged at a 12-year high of 7.25 per cent since the last official increase in March, next meets on August 5.Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan today called for patience in the fight against inflation, given what he described as the ''most difficult global conditions in 25 years''.
