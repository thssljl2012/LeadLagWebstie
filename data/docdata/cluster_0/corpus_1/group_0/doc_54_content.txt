 THE share market zoomed 3.5 per cent higher today to post its biggest single-day rise in almost four months as bargain hunters snapped up banks, property trusts and miners. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index smashed back through the psychological 5000 point barrier, jumping 171.4 points, or 3.54 per cent, to 5011.8.

ABN Amro Morgans Brisbane director of equities Bill Chatterton said local investors were making up for a pretty ordinary day on Friday when local stocks fell over 1 per cent despite a strong US lead. 'Emotion can drive the market down and it gets too cheap,'' Mr Chatterton said. 'Then people realise we're Australia and not the US and our economy's in pretty good damn shape.'' Austock Securities senior client adviser Michael Heffernan said bargain hunters were coming off the sidelines. 'All the dead dogs are getting to their feet,'' he said. 'Everyone's a lot happier today. The US had a run of three days of pretty good performances and the banks are just galloping.'

GPT firmed 12.5 cents, or 8.01 per cent, to $1.685 and Lend Lease advanced 65 cents to $9.40.Sydney Investors may have also been heartened by a surprisingly lower increase in the producer price index (PPI), which raised the likelihood of an interest rate cut this year.
