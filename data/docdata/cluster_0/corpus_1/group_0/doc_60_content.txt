 THE dollar has opened weaker as the US currency gained strength from a trio of better-than-expected data on Friday night.At 7am AEST, the dollar was trading at $US0.9552/56, down from Friday's close of 0.9580/83. Over the weekend offshore session, the dollar moved between $US0.9548 and 0.9609. Bank of New Zealand currency strategist Danica Hampton said the US dollar took some comfort from weaker oil prices and positive US economic data.On Friday night, crude oil futures for September fell $US2.23, or 1.8 per cent, to settle at $US123.26 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Orders for US durable goods rose 0.8 per cent in June, the Commerce Department said. This was against the market's forecast of a small fall and the second straight month it rose, after May's number was revised to a 0.1 per cent increase. Sales of new homes in the US fell less than expected, down 0.6 per cent in June to an annual growth of 530,000 new units, from a revised 533,000 the previous month. It was considerably less than the market median forecast of a 1.8 per cent drop for the month. The Reuters/University of Michigan final index of consumer sentiment rose, from 56.6 points in June to 61.2 this month. 'It was the US dollar story, from the continued slide in oil prices together with a good string of US data,' Ms Hampton said. Today, the National Australia Bank business confidence survey for the June quarter and the Housing Industry Association's new home sales for June are released. Ms Hampton said they would have little impact on the market, with the local currency expected to meander sideways between $US0.9550 and 0.9590. The release of retail sales for June on Thursday would quite key as an indicator of the pace of the Australian economy and the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) reaction to it, Ms Hampton said. 'The retail sales will be quite key in terms of RBA expectations to see whether domestic demand is really slowing rapidly or it is still cracking along at a buoyant pace,' she said.
