 Inflation in New Zealand accelerated to its fastest pace in 18 years in the second quarter, but analysts expect price pressures to ease as the economy slows and remain convinced interest rates will fall in coming months.The consumer price index (CPI) rose a stronger-than-expected 1.6% in the April-June period, the biggest quarterly rise since June 1990 and picking up from 0.7% in the previous quarter, lifted by soaring energy and food costs.But a key measure of domestically generated inflation, which the Reserve Bank of New Zealand focuses on, edged down as domestic demand cooled.Annual inflation was 4%, last touched in June 2006, from 3.4% in the March quarter, moving further above the RBNZ's 1-3% target band.Both the central bank and analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a quarterly CPI rise of 1.4%.The NZ dollar initially gained over a quarter cent to $US0.7670 after the data, but later eased to settle around $US0.7630. The yield on the September bank bill contract firmed a couple of basis points to 8.20%.''Things are slowing across other areas of the economy so dramatically that an historic CPI print shouldn't hold sway, but that's not to say this still won't be a concern for the Reserve Bank, and July is still a very, very close call indeed,'' said ANZ-National Bank economist Philip Borkin.The central bank, which is required to keep inflation within its target range over the medium term, said last month it expected to lower rates later in the year as the economy rapidly cools, even though it has forecast inflation would average 4.6% in the second half of this year.In a recent Reuters poll, all 17 surveyed economists expected the central bank to deliver its first rate cut by September at the latest, with three seeing a move as soon as the July 24 meeting.New Zealand's economy contracted by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in the March quarter, hit by a drought and weaker consumer spending. The latest statistics suggest it shrank again in the second quarter, which would put it in recession.Statistics New Zealand said the non-tradable component of the consumer price index, which is seen as a key measure of domestically generated inflation, rose 0.9% in the June quarter after gaining 1.1% the previous quarter.Inflation in tradables, which measures the prices of goods that face foreign competition, jumped 2.3% in the second quarter, up from 0.2% in the first, reflecting higher global oil and food prices.A business confidence survey by the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research last week showed a net 49% of respondents expected to increase prices in the third quarter, its highest reading since 1997.
