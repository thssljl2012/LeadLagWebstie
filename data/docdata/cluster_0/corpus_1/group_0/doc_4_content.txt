 (Reuters) - Britain's top share index closed 0.5 percent higher on Monday, as better-than-expected results from Bank of America (BAC.N: Quote, Profile, Research) helped UK banking stocks, while firm commodity prices gave a lift to oils and miners.The commodity-heavy FTSE 100 .FTSE ended up 27.9 points at 5,404.3, after rising 0.5 percent last week, its first weekly advance in more than two months. But the benchmark index is down 16 percent so far this year.Banks extended earlier gains after Bank of America figures showed profit fell less than expected, as improved investment banking and trading results offset a surge in bad loans.Bank of America became the fourth of the nation's five largest banks to top earnings forecasts, joining Citigroup (C.N: Quote, Profile, Research), JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N: Quote, Profile, Research) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N: Quote, Profile, Research).Improved sentiment supported UK banks, with  (RBS.L: Quote, Profile, Research), Barclays (BARC.L: Quote, Profile, Research), HSBC (HSBA.L: Quote, Profile, Research), Alliance &amp;amp; Leicester (ALLL.L: Quote, Profile, Research) and Standard Chartered (STAN.L: Quote, Profile, Research) rising between 0.4 and 2.5 percent.Traders and analysts said the results were positive for the market, but investors were not yet convinced that the financial sector crisis was easing, or that the economic outlook was improving. 'There is a bit of relief and a little bit of confidence, but still a huge amount of apprehension and concern over the long-term picture,' said Angus Campbell, head of sales at Capital Spreads. 'Overall, the trend is still downward, and it's difficult to say whether the banking sector has got to a stage yet whereby its downward spiral is completely over.' The difficult market conditions were also highlighted by Britain's financial watchdog, which said lenders that receive support from the Bank of England might be allowed to delay revealing the information to the market to avoid alarming consumers and exacerbating their problems. [ID:nL21937507] 'The UK economy appears to be more resilient, but the credit crunch and deteriorating outlook for consumer expenditure will continue to undermine the market,' said Richard Moore, a fund manager at Santander Asset Management. 'Inflation has now replaced the credit crunch as the key factor in determining market prospects, and this remains driven by the oil prices,' he said in a note.
