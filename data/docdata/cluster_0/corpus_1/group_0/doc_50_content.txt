 The price of oil set a record high above 146 dollars a barrel this week owing to falling reserves of US crude, simmering tensions over Iran and a weak dollar, traders said.OIL: Brent North Sea oil for August delivery surged to a life-time peak of 146.69 dollars a barrel on Thursday, before cooling as traders banked their profits.New York's main oil contract, light sweet crude for August delivery, leapt to an all-time pinnacle of 145.85 dollars the same day.'Prices rose to set new all-time highs ... supported by a decline in US crude oil inventories,' said Barclays Capital analyst Kevin Norrish.Oil prices, which have doubled in value over the past year, were driven by news that American crude stockpiles fell by 2.0 million barrels to stand at 299.8 million barrels in the week to June 27.The latest record-breaking price surge also came after Iranian Oil Minister Gholam Hossein Nozari said that Iran would react fiercely to any military attack against the oil exporter.The OPEC oil exporting group said it would be difficult to replace the crude output of Iran should the country face attack.The oil market also found key support from the struggling US currency, which makes dollar-priced commodities cheaper for foreign buyers and tends to encourage demand, analysts said.By Friday, Brent North Sea crude for August jumped to 144.86 dollars a barrel from 140.81 dollars a week earlier.New York's main oil futures contract, light sweet crude for August climbed to 144.10 dollars a barrel, from 140.85 dollars.PRECIOUS METALS: Gold, seen as a haven in times of economic troubles, reached 946.40 dollars a tonne, the highest level since April.'You've got inflation, geopolitical risk, extremely high oil prices and a weak economy. All the pieces of the puzzle are there for gold to go higher,' said Matt Zeman, a metals trader at LaSalle Futures Group.On the London Bullion Market, gold advanced to 931.25 dollars per ounce at Friday's late fixing from 919.50 dollars a week earlier.Silver grew to 18.01 dollars per ounce from 17.40 dollars.On the London Platinum and Palladium Market, platinum dropped to 2,012 dollars per ounce at the late fixing on Friday from 2,053 dollars a week earlier.Palladium slid to 456 dollars per ounce from 467 dollars.SUGAR: Sugar prices reached the highest levels since March as oil prices surged.The raw material is used in the production of ethanol, which is a cheaper alternative to motor fuel.By Friday on LIFFE, the price per tonne of white sugar for October delivery rallied to 393 pounds from 377.80 pounds the previous week.On NYBOT, the price of unrefined sugar for October delivery increased to 13.91 US cents per pound from 13.10 cents.
