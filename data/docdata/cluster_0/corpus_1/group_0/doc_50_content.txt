 The minutes of the July policy meeting of the Reserve Bank of Australia board confirm the central bank is not getting ready to hike interest rates again in the near future.The minutes from the July 1 meeting, released this morning, reiterate the message in the RBA's statement released immediately after the meeting.On balance, while members remained concerned about the current rate of inflation and the uncertainties around the outlook, the increasing signs that demand was slowing suggested that the existing policy setting was exerting the appropriate degree of restraint, the minutes said.There was the usual warning that the current relatively high inflation rate of over four per cent risked a pick-up in wage demands and inflation expectations.There was also the familiar warning that the recent rise in the terms of trade would boost incomes and could boost spending as a result.However, much of the content of the minutes dealt with signs of slowing economic growth, in weaker lending to businesses and households, consumer spending and demand for labour.The minutes noted the May employment data showing the first fall for more than 18 months.While the figures could be volatile, softer figures in the months ahead would be consistent with other indicators that were showing a moderation in demand, the minutes said.The expectation of slower employment growth implies the RBA will feel no urgency in responding to any hints of resurgent spending.While the minutes should reassure anyone worried about possible interest rate hikes, there was no hint that the RBA was toying with the idea of cutting the cash rate from its current 7.25 per cent.
