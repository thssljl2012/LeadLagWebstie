 After the Reserve bank badgering banks about passing on any interest rate cut they (the RBA) might deliver next month, one of the big four is now telling the Reserve that it is time for an interest rate cut:  WESTPAC has stepped up pressure for a cut in official interest rates of half a percentage point next month, arguing that the economy is weaker than widely believed.   ..."It is now clear that we need a significant easing in interest rates,&amp;#8221; Westpac&amp;#8217;s chief economist Bill Evans said.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#8220;This is the slowest growth rate of the index since July 2001 and the sharpest fall in the growth rate since 2000.&amp;nbsp; There is a strong case for the Reserve Bank to move by a larger amount, by 0.5%, particularly given that at the beginning of a rate-cut cycle it&amp;#8217;s best to have your biggest move, because that&amp;#8217;s when it&amp;#8217;s safest because that&amp;#8217;s when rates are at their highest.&amp;#8221;  So presumably this means any cut by the Reserve would be passed on in full?&amp;nbsp; The other interesting thing is the speculation about a full 0.5% cut: that is looking more and more likely.&amp;nbsp; More on this later.   ELSEWHERE: I meant to note this Ross Gittins &amp;#8216;piece mentioned in comments yesterday:  The credit crunch has raised borrowing costs for non-bank mortgage originators to the point where they&amp;#8217;re unable to compete with the banks. The banks have won back most of the market share they lost and now would dearly love to put more fat back into their interest margin.   If the banks fail to pass on in full the 0.25 percentage-point cut in the official interest rate we&amp;#8217;re likely to see in a fortnight&amp;#8217;s time, that&amp;#8217;s what they&amp;#8217;ll be doing. The banks&amp;#8217; borrowing costs have already fallen in the past few weeks so if they fail to unwind their unofficial rate rises they&amp;#8217;ll also be fattening their interest margin at home buyers&amp;#8217; expense.   But competition may yet come to the rescue. The first bank to pass on the rate cut in full would get favourable publicity and the others would have to match it.  AND ALSO: Looks like all that badgering from the RBA and the government might be working:  National Australia Bank became the first of the major banks to break ranks over the cost of home loan funding with a promise today to pass on the full effects of any forthcoming interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank.   In a move which will put immense pressure on the rest of the Big Four and the largest of the second tier banks, St George, to follow suit, NAB took the highly unusual step of declaring it will reduce its top line mortgage by a quarter of a one percentage if the RBA moves downward as expected next month.
