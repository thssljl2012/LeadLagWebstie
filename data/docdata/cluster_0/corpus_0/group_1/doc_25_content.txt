Financial fears, soaring inflation hit Wall St                                                                    By Walter Brandimarte                     Go To OriginalStocks fell more than 1 percent on  Tuesday as financial shares declined on renewed credit worries  and a report showed inflation is still a threat to the economy,  despite the economic slowdown.                           Shares of financial companies were the biggest drag on the  Dow and the S&amp;amp;P 500, with Bank of America (BAK.N) and Wells  Fargo (WFC.N) sliding about 4 percent each and the KBW index of  bank stocks falling 4.1 percent.                           Reminding investors that the effects of the housing slump  are still far from over, JPMorgan Securities forecast  investment bank Lehman Brothers (LEH.N) will take a further $4  billion of write-downs in the third quarter due to losses from  mortgage-related investments.                           Goldman Sachs added to the gloomy outlook as it downgraded  the price target for the stock of American International Group  Inc (AIG.N), saying the potential for capital raisings and  rating downgrades is increasingly likely for the world's  largest insurer.                           "We are back to struggling again, in the financial sector  particularly," said William Stone, chief investment strategist  at PNC Financial in Philadelphia. "Underneath some of that is  just concern about the overall global economic slowdown."                           The Dow Jones industrial average (.DJI) fell 130.35 points,  or 1.14 percent, to 11,349.04, while the Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500  Index (.SPX) declined 12.01 points, or 0.94 percent, to  1,266.59, after earlier falling more than 1 percent to a  session low at 1,263.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index (.IXIC)  shed 29.30 points, or 1.21 percent, to 2,387.68.                           A much higher-than-expected inflation reading for July also  scared some investors who fear the U.S. Federal Reserve might  be in an increasingly difficult position to maintain its policy  of low interest rates.                           The government's Producer Price Index shot up at the  fastest annual rate in 27 years in July, while core producer  prices, excluding volatile food and energy prices, underwent  their fastest rise since November 2006.                           "Clearly, there is more resilience in the prices than we  thought and I think this is reflecting a pass-through from the  strength we had seen in commodity prices," said Anna Piretti,  senior economist with BNP Paribas in New York.                           She said, however, that the weakness in domestic demand  should contain prices going forward.                           "Consumers are not likely to make very large ticket  purchases when prospects in the labor market are weakening and  confidence remains very low."                            FINANCIALS TUMBLE AGAIN                           Shares of AIG plunged 7.3 percent to $20.02 after Goldman  Sachs cut its price target on the stock to $23 from $30, while  Lehman BrothersJP Morgan Securities. lost 9.9 percent to $13.55 on negative forecast  by                            Bank of America's shares fell 4.3 percent to $28.02 and  Wells Fargo shed 3.9 percent to $27.68.                           Shares of home builders also slid following a bleak report  on housing starts by the Commerce Department. For the month of  July, housing starts dropped 11 percent -- the lowest annual  rate in more than 17 years.                           Shares of Pulte Homes (PHM.N) , the No. 3 U.S. home  builder, declined 2.5 percent to $12.22. The Dow Jones index of  home builders' shares dropped 2.6 percent.                           On Nasdaq, shares of Staples Inc (SPLS.O) tumbled 4.8  percent to $23.39 after the leading U.S. office supply chain  said tough market conditions hurt quarterly results.
