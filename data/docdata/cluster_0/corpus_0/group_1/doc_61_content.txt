  Business conditions have weakened to the lowest level since the month after September 11 terror attacks, as firms battle tighter credit conditions and falling demand, a survey shows.  Meanwhile, business confidence levels have stuck the lowest point since the 1991 recession. The findings of the National Australia Bank's (NAB) July business survey coincide with forecasts from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) that domestic demand growth is moderating significantly.According to the NAB survey, the index of business conditions fell in July by five points to minus five points - the weakest reading since October 2001 - the survey of 415 private-sector firms found.  The latest reading is 25 points below a peak reached in October 2007. The business confidence reading for July remained at minus nine points for the second month in a row.NAB chief economist Alan Oster said the report showed the Australian economy was slowing faster than predicted.  "It's an economy that has slowed very, very rapidly," he said. "One of the big problems we've had is it's moving faster than we thought.  "It's not a very nice survey; that's essentially the short answer."All three components of the business conditions measure - profitability, employment and trading - declined in July as higher interest rates hurt consumer confidence and demand, the report found.
