Real wages fall as record price hikes hit US workers By Andre Damon                     Go To OriginalUS prices jumped in July by their highest month-to-month rate since 1981, in  one of the sharpest inflation spikes since the Second World War. The July Producer Prices index, reported Tuesday by the Bureau of Labor  Statistics, rose by 1.2 percent, on top of a 1.8 percent increase in June.  "Core" prices, which exclude food and energy, shot up by .7 percent, more than  triple economists' expectations. Producer prices were up 9.8 percent from a year  ago. "There is no doubt we're in a period of stagflation," Peter Kretzmer, a  senior economist at Bank of America, told Bloomberg News, referring to the  combination of stagnant growth and inflation, which characterized the US economy  in the 1970s. The consumer price statistics released last Thursday mirrored the producer  price statistics. Seasonally-adjusted consumer prices jumped .8 percent last  monthmore than double earlier predictionsand were up 5.6 percent since July  2007. Even so, inflation has picked up in recent months. While the Consumer  Price Index rose at a comparatively low annualized rate of only 2.8 percent in  the first quarter, it shot up at an annualized rate of ten percent in the past  three months. The living standards of workers continue to decline as the purchasing power  of their wages falls and pay increases fail to keep up with inflation. The most  recent Bureau of Labor statistics report found that real average weekly earnings  fell by .8 percent from June to July. Over the past year, weekly earnings fell  by 3.1 percent. Thus, the average household now earns a staggering $1,500 less  than it would if wages had kept pace with inflation over the past twelve  months. Skyrocketing prices, falling wages, rising unemployment, and falling home  values are all lining up to create a massive social catastrophe. According to  Credit Suisse, the credit analyst, there will be some 6.5 million home  foreclosures by 2012, amounting to 12.7 percent of homeowners with mortgages.  While arranging multi-billion dollar bailout of big investors involved in the  mortgage meltdown, the Democrats and Republicans have offered no relief for  working people facing the loss of their homes and unsustainable levels of  debt. The housing market, one of the main components of the US slowdown, showed no  signs of improvement, as the construction of new homes fell 30 percent lower  than a year ago. "A [housing market] recovery will not happen this year,''  Russell Price, a senior economist at H&amp;amp;R Block told Bloomberg News. "Not  only are mortgage rates creeping up, but financing is becoming more difficult  for a lot of people. Builders will continue to pull back.'' The unexpectedly high US inflation statistics followed the announcement last  week that the Eurozone economy contracted for the first time since the creation  of the European Monetary Union in 1999. Combined output in the fifteen Eurozone  counties fell by .2 percent in the second quarter. Germany was particularly hard  hit, with output falling by .5 percent in the second quarter. France's economy  contracted by .3 percent and Italy's by .3 percent. The British, Spanish, Greek, and Austrian economies managed to avoid  contracting, but all grew at rates lower than one percent. The weaker position  of the Eurowhich has helped keep the US economy from shrinking in the last  several quartershas dragged down growth of the EU's largest exporters: Germany,  France, and Italy. Meanwhile, the Japanese economy contracted .6 percent in the second quarter,  according to figures released last week by the government. Japan is the world's  second-largest economy and the fourth-largest exporter. Thus far, all eight of  the world's largest exportersexcluding Chinahave announced at least one  quarter of stagnation or negative growth. Consumer Price inflation also reached its highest level since the creation of  the Euro. Consumer prices rose by 4.1 percent in the second quarter, more than  double the European Union's inflation target of 2 percent. Despite facing similar difficultiesslowing growth and rising pricesthe US  and European Central banks have reacted in completely opposite ways. In the past  year, the US Federal Reserve has cut its benchmark Federal Funds Rate from 5.25  to 2 percent. The European Central Bank has on the other hand proceeded to raise  rates to 4.25 percent. This is at least partially due to the differing levels of success the  European and US corporate elite have enjoyed in suppressing the wage demands of  the working class in their respective countries. Thus far, the American ruling  class, with the full assistance of the trade union bureaucracy, has kept wage  increases well below the rate of inflation despite widespread anger over high  prices and eroding living standards. By contrast, German wages have risen at the  same rate as inflation, which reached an annual rate 3.5 percent in the second  quarter. The Wall Street Journal, noting the results of its recent survey of  leading economists, observed that "part of the reason for the disparity [in  central bank policy] is the difference between the European and US work forces.  Some 94 percent of respondents said the US's risk of a wage-price spiral, where  pressures from labor costs and high prices push each other up, is either minor  or nonexistent. But 34 percent said that the Eurozone countries face a major  risk of a wage-price spiral, and 9 percent said it is already beginning." The Federal Reserve, facing a financial meltdown that would cost the US  government hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars, has pumped huge  amounts of cash into the US economy. It has kept interest rates extremely low,  extended billions of dollars in loans to Wall Street, and all but guaranteed  that it would bail out any large financial firms that run into trouble. This,  combined with rising commodity prices, has contributed to persistently high  inflation rates despite radically falling wages. But, despite all this, the Fed has been unable to stabilize the financial  sector. In recent days, the conditions facing major finance companies have only  worsened. On Wednesday the Treasury Department backed away from its previous  assertions that it would not bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, after the two  firms saw their stock values plunge more than thirty percent since Monday. Meanwhile, Kenneth Rogoff, the former IMF chief economist, said Tuesday that  "the worst is yet to come," and that another major financial firm is likely to  collapse in the next few months. "We're not just going to see mid-sized banks go  under in the next few months," he said at a conference in Singapore. "We're  going to see a whopper, we're going to see a big one, one of the big investment  banks or big banks."
