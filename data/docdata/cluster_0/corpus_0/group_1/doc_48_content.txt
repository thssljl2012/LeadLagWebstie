Oil prices slid further Tuesday, dropping to as low as $118 a barrel on widening expectations that the slumping U.S. economy will keep eroding consumer demand for gasoline and other petroleum products.  The U.S. dollar's gains against the euro also contributed to oil's decline. Light, sweet crude for September delivery was down $1.51 at $119.90 a barrel in premarket trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, it dropped to $118, before regaining some ground. Crude has now fallen more than $25 since reaching a trading high of $147.27 on July 11. The growing belief that soaring prices have stifled demand has halted what appeared to be a relentless march higher. "The main factor weighing on oil prices is worries about oil consumption being weakened, especially in the U.S.," said David Moore, a commodity strategist with Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. On Monday, the Commerce Department said consumer spending after adjusting for inflation fell 0.2 percent in June  the biggest drop since February  as shoppers dealt with higher prices for gasoline, food and other items. Oil prices also fell as Tropical Storm Edouard seemed less likely to disrupt oil and natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico. Though Edouard was threatening to pick up strength from warm Gulf waters and gain near-hurricane speeds over the next 24 hours, it likely would not be strong enough to damage offshore oil and natural gas drilling platforms that sit in its path.
