 As an erstwhile junior academic (at a think tank masterfully led by the Economic Yoda, Dicko), it makes me laugh when I read about how Ben "Helicopter" Bernanke (whose retirement is now three months overdue... ) is an expert on the Depression. The moment I read that, I though "Oh Jeebus... he's a bloody essay-writer." There are two types of economist, Dearest Reader... those who can do sums, and those we used to call essay-writers. Some of the folks who can do sums can also write essays - essay-writing is not a particularly hard skill to master. But generally speaking, essay-writing economists are almost completely innumerate. Folks assert (by 'folks' I mean economic historians as a group) that one can be an 'economic historian' and do decent analysis without having any technical skill whatsoever (by 'technical skill' I mean the ability to analyse data using mathematical tools... the ability to 'do sums'). I disagree. Folks like Mises and Hayek were somewhat 'anti-sums' (they didn't like the idea of trying to forecast stuff, for example), but although I agree with their underlying economics, this antipathy to numerical analysis is something I find baffling. So long as one doesn't view analysis of reduced-form evidence as an exercise in the generation of Gospel Truth, then mathematical modelling - done properly - can be and is a very useful tool. So... Dr Helicopter knows all about the Great Depression, and yet his recipe for preventing a disaster was astraight out of the Weimar Republic. If push came to shove and there was evidence in the government statistics of deflation, Dr Helicopter promised money printing. I wonder if he read anything about the Weimar Republic during his doctorate? (See how fair I am being - I have not required him to move away from the first half of the 20th century, although he could also have looks at the Argentine hyperinflation as well). Major Market Indices The broad market - the All Ordinaries (XAO) - advanced almost imperceptibly, rising 0.5 points (0.01%), finishing at 5075.9 points (5075-ish). The index hit an intraday high of 5077.6 at 3:37 pm, while the low for the day was 5023.2 (2025-ish) - set at 11:54 am (noon-ish) Sydney time. Total volume traded on the ASX was soft at 1.22 billion units, 15.7% below its 10-day average which is itself declining.

Of these, 541 issues rose, with volume in rising issues totalling 634.4 million units. Conversely (or even contrariwise), 510 stocks lost ground for the day, with aggregate volume traded of 481.2 million shares. Of the 494 All Ordinaries components, 235 rose while 189 fell. Aggregate volume within the All Ords was evenly split - 368.02 million shares traded in gainers while 377.01 million shares traded in the day's losers. The Index that forms the cash basis for the SFE's Share Price Index Futures - the S&amp;P/ASX 200 (XJO) - fell mildly, losing 6.2 points (0.12%), closing out the session at 5005.6 points.
