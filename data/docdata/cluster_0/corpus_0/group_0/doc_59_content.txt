 Australian markets breathed a bit of a sigh of relief despite a moderately&amp;nbsp;bleh session in the States. Woolies was prepared to reiterate its earnings guidance, and so everybody piled into Consumer Staples... honestly - does&amp;nbsp;anybody bother to have a bit of a think before they hit 'Buy at Market'? I'm not going to bother to put up a chart of WOW's consensus estimates and how they have been slashed over the past 6 months. I'm not going to make snarky comments about how corporate managements are far more likely to reiterate earnings guidance when they have a bunch of mates who are on the verge of selling escrowed 'deferred compensation' stock. I'm not going to bother carrying on about how WOW wouldn't know if it was going to make its numbers until the day before they are released. I'm just not going to bother. Frankly, the fact that a mid-price-point supermarket chain is able to satisfy some fairly mild growth assumptions, is not surprising. Following the guidance of my former economic Yoda (Dicko) I refer to this as the 'Bread and Cakes' phenomenon. 'Bread and Cakes' was (and maybe still is) an Industry category in the Monash CGE model (and in models derived therefrom). One of its characteristics is that it's not very volatile, because demand for its products is driven in large part by 'non discretionary' spending, and less by 'supernumerary' spending. Back in the olden days, we used Bread and Cakes to explain to Westpac how we went about doing a stochastic simulation with the Monash model; it was designed to help them arrange their lending and credit policy along sensible lines, given plausible scenarios for the forecast period (and sensible departures from departures from said scenarios... it became my PhD topic, which remains an Unfinished Symphony). The core issue (for Westpac) was that there are industries who over-borrow when times are good as well as bad; our thinking was that this over-investment was driven by high levels of uncertainty about rates of return and also by static expectations. So if a busienss in such an industry experienced very high rates of return near and economic peak, they would borrow heavily to expand just at the wrong point in the cycle. They would behave like small non-commerical futures traders, in other words. Bread and cakes isn't an industry in which rates of return are volatile. That industry chugs along, selling white loaves and the occasional fairy cake. Doubtless the credit-driven pretentiousness of inner-urban housewives meant that fairy-cakes were renamed Madeleines or some such, and Sally Lunns became something else and cost $8 a pop. But for the most part it's white square bread and stable rates of return. And basic shopping centre retail is the same. And at bottom, it is a stylised fact that the last thing that consumers will cut back on, is their essentials... Bread and Cakes. Retrenchment is hierarchical - supernumerary buget shares fall first. So if anything can be taken from WOW's announcement, it is that consumer retrenchment has not properly started. Major Market Indices The broad market - the All Ordinaries (XAO) - advanced modestly, rising 37.4 points (0.76%), finishing at 4947.5 points (4950-ish).

The Index that forms the cash basis for the SFE's Share Price Index Futures - the S&amp;P/ASX 200 (XJO) - managed a solid gain, adding 54.9 points (1.14%), closing out the session at 4870.6 points.

Among the 20 big guns, 15 index components finished to the upside, and of the rest, 4 closed lower for the session. The 20 stocks which make up the index traded a total of 172.69 million units; 15 index components rose, with rising volume amounting to 108.72 million shares, while the 4 decliners had volume traded totalling 16.7 million units. The major percentage gainers within the index were    ANZ Bank (ANZ), +$0.91 (5.32%) to $18.03 on volume of 13.4 million shares;   Wesfarmers (WES), +$1.36 (4.39%) to $32.36 on volume of 3.1 million shares;   Foster's Group (FGL), +$0.18 (4.17%) to $4.50 on volume of 9 million shares;   Westpac&amp;nbsp;(WBC), +$0.69 (3.69%) to $19.37 on volume of 8.8 million shares; and   National Australia Bank (NAB), +$0.92 (3.63%) to $26.28 on volume of 8.8 million shares.   On the less salubrious side of the big-cap fence, the following stocks were the worst-performed within the index - for the most part due to the orchestrated skinning of newbie Crude Oil traders. As for CSL? who cares... I said five years ago - with CSL at over $50 -&amp;nbsp;that unless people started bathing in blood plasma CSL wouldn't go anywhere. Despite Cheney's best efforts ,the world is not yet enough bathed in blood:    Woodside Petroleum (WPL), -$1.83 (2.98%) to $59.60 on volume of 2 million shares;   CSL (CSL), -$0.36 (1.07%) to $33.44 on volume of 1.5 million shares;   BHP Billiton (BHP), -$0.33 (0.84%) to $39.03 on volume of 12.2 million shares; and   Rio Tinto (RIO), -$0.92 (0.75%) to $121.08 on volume of 1.1 million shares.   At the other end of the market-cap spectrum lie the denizens of the ASX Small Ordinaries (XSO) - the sweet spot for stock analysis (these companies generalyl do't pay for coverage by the big houses, and so are both under-researched and non-manipulated). The small-fry swam in the opposite direction to the big fish today - a reversal of the rotation that I have been blathering on about for the last few OzRants.&amp;nbsp; The tiddlers stayed underwater while the Top20 posted a gain. The Small Ords slid modestly, falling 22 points (0.77%), closing out the session at 2843.6 points. Among the stocks that make up the Small Caps index, 62 index components finished to the upside, and of the rest, 122 closed lower for the session. The 195 stocks which make up the index traded a total of 249.81 million units: volume in the 62 gainers totalling 96.12 million shares, with trade totalling 136.01 million units in the index's 122 declining components. The major percentage gainers within the index were    Record Realty (RRT), +$0.01 (17.02%) to $0.06 on volume of 1.1 million shares;   Spotless Group (SPT), +$0.31 (11.61%) to $2.98 on volume of 568.9 thousand shares;   Rubicon America Trust (RAT), +$0.01 (9.89%) to $0.10 on volume of 3.2 million shares;   AWB Limited (AWB), +$0.19 (7.69%) to $2.66 on volume of 1.5 million shares; and   Mineral Deposits (MDL), +$0.05 (6.29%) to $0.76 on volume of 127.4 thousand shares.
