Hurting, Not Whining                     Go To Original  Yesterday, in an interview with the Washington Times, former Sen. Phil Gramm,  the so-called "econ  brain" of presidential candidate Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), remarked that the  United States has "sort  of become a nation of whiners." "Thank God the economy is not as bad as you  read in the newspaper every day." "You've  heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession," he said. Yesterday  afternoon, McCain said that Gramm "does not speak for me," despite the fact that  Gramm's comments mirror what&amp;nbsp;McCain said in April: "A  lot of our problems today, as you know, are psychological." Gramm's apparent  desire to keep to a minimum discussion of the real and painful effects of the  nation's stalling economy is not surprising, given that he shares the same  harmful conservative ideology as McCain and Bush. Gramm&amp;nbsp;played a key roll in  gutting many of the institutions designed to keep the economy sound. Serving  Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee between 1999 and 2001, he "routinely  turned down Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt's requests  for more money to police Wall Street." Later, he "pushed  to end oversight" of energy futures trading for a key campaign contributor  and his wife's onetime employer, Enron. Around the same time, "Gramm pushed  through a historic banking deregulation bill that decimated Depression-era  firewalls between commercial banks, investment banks, insurance companies, and  securities firms." The financial maneuvers enabled by Gramm's legislative  measures would become "the  heart of the subprime meltdown." More recently, it was revealed that Gramm  was "being  paid by a Swiss bank to lobby Congress about the U.S. mortgage crisis at the  same time he was advising McCain about his economic policy." But while Gramm is  able to insulate himself, and even  profit from, the negative effects of his legislative and lobbying record,  the vast majority of Americans are not so fortunate. Here are 10 real examples  of how Americans are hurting in the current economy: HOUSING FORECLOSURES INCREASING: As a result of  the subprime lending crisis, "housing foreclosures nationwide were up 50% in  June compared with the same month in 2007." In California alone, foreclosures  have reached an average of 500  per day.HOMELESSNESS&amp;nbsp;INCREASING: The number of homeless  people in America over the age of 50 is "steadily  increasing." HEALTHCARE  COSTS&amp;nbsp;RISING: According to a report by the Government Accountability  Office, "health-care  costs are growing much faster than the economy." Costs are rising so  significantly, some Americans are delaying  retirement.GAS PRICES&amp;nbsp;RISING:  The national average gas price is $4.09, up 33  percent from this time last year. Gas prices are now expected to hit "$4.25  by the fall and then stay at more than $4 a gallon  until the end of 2009."JOB  LOSSES&amp;nbsp;INCREASING: In the first six months of this year, a total of 438,000  jobs have been lost, bringing unemployment to 5.5 percent. The CEO of Bank  of America commented, if unemployment continues to rise, "all  bets are off."FOOD  COSTS&amp;nbsp;RISING: "U.S. food prices rose 4 percent in 2007" --&amp;nbsp;the fastest  rise in 17 years -- and as a result, food stamps have considerably  less buying power.HEATING AND  ELECTRICITY COSTS&amp;nbsp;RISING: Heating oil costs across the North are expected  to be "up 60 percent from last year," and utilities across the country are "raising  power prices up to 29%." REAL WAGES&amp;nbsp;DECLINING: "Slower wage growth and  faster inflation has led to falling  real hourly and weekly earnings for most workers." LEISURE  SPENDING&amp;nbsp;DECLINING: As a result of the rising cost of living, Americans  are "tightening  their belts and thinking twice about spending extra bucks on entertainment  and leisure products."VALUE  OF&amp;nbsp;DOLLAR&amp;nbsp;DECLINING: The dollar "has  been declining steadily for six years against other major currencies,  undercutting its role as the leading international banking currency."
