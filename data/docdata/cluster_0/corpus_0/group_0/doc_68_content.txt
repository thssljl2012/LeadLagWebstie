You, too, can be an oil speculator By Tim Middleton MSN July 1st, 2008 Their impact on the price of oil and other commodities is exaggerated, but hedge funds and others are making a lot of money betting on higher prices. You can play the game, too. If Congress is against speculating in oil and other commodities, it&amp;#8217;s probably the best investment idea around&amp;#8230; The oil-patch plays By no surprise, iPath S&amp;amp;P Crude Oil Total Return Index ETN (OIL) is the single hottest exchange-traded fund over the last year, ahead an amazing 116%, as of June 27. This is an exchange-traded note, or ETN, a variety of ETF that represents a kind of loan, rather than a portfolio of securities. Absent a credit default &amp;#8212; and the banking unit of Barclays (BCS), which backs these shares, has not been tarred by defaults &amp;#8212; it guarantees the return of an index, in this case the price of West Texas Intermediate, or sweet, crude oil, less its own expenses of 0.75%. US Oil 12 Months (USL) is a true ETF that invests in a basket of monthly sweet-crude futures contracts that stretches forward for one year, smoothing out some of the technical volatility that adds to price swings as monthly contracts expire. Morningstar analyst Emiko Kurotsu recommends this fund over its better-known sibling, United States Oil Fund (USO), for this reason. The fund lacks a 12-month record, but this year it was ahead 38.9%. Expenses are 0.6%. PowerShares DB Oil (DBO) also invests in sweet-crude futures and has expenses of only 0.5%. In the past year it has shot up 93.5%. Beyond oil PowerShares DB Agriculture (DBA) uses futures to invest in agricultural commodities such as corn and soybeans. This is a theme with its own dynamics, only some of which impinge on energy. Food prices are soaring, in part because corn is being used to produce ethanol. This ETF is ahead 59% in the past year. full article ________ Overnight millionaires Landowners in western North Dakota have a much better chance of striking it rich from oil than they do playing the lottery, say the Stohlers. Some of their neighbors in the town of about 120, from bar tenders to Tupperware salespeople, have become &amp;#8220;overnight millionaires&amp;#8221; from oil royalty payments. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s the easiest money we&amp;#8217;ve ever made,&amp;#8221; said Lorene Stohler, who worked for decades as a sales clerk at a small department store. State and industry officials say North Dakota is on pace to set a state oil-production record this year, surpassing the 52.6 million barrels produced in 1984. A record number of drill rigs are piercing the prairie and North Dakota has nearly 4,000 active oil wells. The drilling frenzy has led companies to search for oil using horizontal drilling beneath Parshall, a town of about 980 in Mountrail County, and under Lake Sakakawea, 180-mile-long reservoir on the Missouri River. 52.6 million is 144,000 barrels per day, which would make North Dakota the 43rd largest producer in the world, behind Trinidad &amp;amp; Tobago and ahead of Uzbekistan. Weird. If there are 4000 wells, than each one pulls an average of 36 barrels per day, or $5000 a day, or $1,800,000 a year. full story
