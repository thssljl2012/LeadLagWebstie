          The latest data from the Bank of England shows new mortgage approvals fell by 68 per cent in June to 38,000, the lowest level since the early 90s. The figures prove there are fewer buyers than ever in the market place.   Those buyers that remain are increasing undercutting asking prices, according to estate agents, in an attempt to grab a bargain. Lloyds TSB, which announced a 70 per cent fall in profits today, said it expects house prices to fall 15 per cent by the end of the year.   Times Money has put together a list using figures from Hometrack, the property data provider, showing average completion prices as a percentage of original asking prices for each county in the UK.
