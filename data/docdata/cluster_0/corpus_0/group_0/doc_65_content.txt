European Central Bank officials are increasingly suggesting it may take longer than expected for the euro-zone to limp out of a weak second quarter. &amp;#8220;It could be that recovery takes more time,&amp;#8221; said ECB executive board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi in Italy&amp;#8217;s La Stampa newspaper, when asked about the outlook for the fourth quarter, stressing that [...] European Central Bank officials are increasingly suggesting it may take longer than expected for the euro-zone to limp out of a weak second quarter. &amp;#8220;It could be that recovery takes more time,&amp;#8221; said ECB executive board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi in Italy&amp;#8217;s La Stampa newspaper, when asked about the outlook for the fourth quarter, stressing that the ECB has always said there were downside risks to its growth forecasts. ECB Governing Council member Klaus Liebscher, meanwhile, said the ECB expects weaker euro-zone growth of around 1.7%-1.8% this year, slightly below projections of around 1.8% it issued in June. Those projections assumed an oil price of $113 per barrel this year and $117.7 next year. On Tuesday, the going price for brent spot was above $131. &amp;#8220;The problem is 2009, when growth weakens (further),&amp;#8221; said Mr. Liebscher, who also heads Austria&amp;#8217;s central bank, in an interview with Austria&amp;#8217;s Salzburger Nachrichten newspaper. &amp;#8220;Downward risks are predominant.&amp;#8221; The ECB&amp;#8217;s June forecasts called for growth around 1.5% next year.  ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet also downgraded his growth assessment slightly last week, saying in an interview with four European newspapers that the euro-zone economy would &amp;#8220;trough&amp;#8221; in the second and third quarters before staging a progressive recovery. Mr. Trichet had previously maintained that the &amp;#8220;trough&amp;#8221; would come in the second quarter.  &amp;#8220;These comments continue to suggest that the next set of ECB staff projections will feature further downward revisions,&amp;#8221; Nick Matthews at Barclays Capital said. Barclays expects the revisions, due September 4, to come in at 1.6% for this year, and 1.3% for 2009. Such forecasts would still be more optmistic than those of many private-sector economists, who believe the euro-zone could be heading for a hard landing and perhaps a recession.  But ECB policymakers Tuesday also stressed persistent inflation pressures. With euro-zone inflation at 4% in June, more than double the bank&amp;#8217;s preferred range, the ECB raised its key rate by 25 basis points to 4.25% earlier this month.  Mr. Bini Smaghi said that the July increase has already produced a &amp;#8220;visible benefit&amp;#8221; on inflation expectations. But he also said that with inflation at more than double the bank&amp;#8217;s preferred range, the ECB&amp;#8217;s key 4.25% rate &amp;#8220;can&amp;#8217;t plausibly be called restrictive,&amp;#8221; suggesting policy makers remain focused on keeping high commodity and food prices from pushing up domestic prices including wages. &amp;#8211;Monica Houston-Waesch
