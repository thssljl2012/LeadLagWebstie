            A Bloomberg article covering the drops in demand for various commodities. After itemizing stuff like China's 19% drop in copper imports, and India's 50% drop in gold purchases, the article then turns to supply.Slowing global growth signals commodity demand will ``soften,'' the International Monetary Fund said in March. During the last U.S. recession in 2001, the CRB index plunged 16 percent.Commodities advanced this year during a ``buying orgy'' by investors seeking better returns than stocks and bonds, Paul Touradji, founder of the $3.5 billion hedge fund Touradji Capital Management, said in March.

The problem is that when that happens, they may be worth $40-$50 less.The smell of money burning in the summer can lead to very unpleasant circumstances!What happens when this collapse is layered on top of all the other problems? It's going to be very interesting, in a Night-Of-The-Living-Undead sort of way.
