 The agliness to which the best lay'd plans can aft gang, should never surprise one. {Apologies to those who don't speak The Poet Burns}. But really - you sort of expect that if you stickytape the HTML in the right hole on the internets tubes, that it will pop out where you ought to expect it. Not so - I plonked the OzRant's juicy fulminations into Blogger's gaping maw, and hit 'Publish'... then for the first time in years, I didn't click "View Blog". Why? You ask. Good question. Because I had already spell checked it, and read it through thoroughly; I was confident that I hadn't left any grossies there to stick out like a bulldog's danglies. {Of course that guarantees that such a grossie appears below} Now you might think that the above doesn't sound like a very plausible reason... so I confess. I really, really needed a poo at 9 a.m. French time... the legacy of having sat up since 5 a.m. eating yesterday's baguette while gnawing on one of those wild boar sausages I mentioned earlier in the week. Delicious, but prone to getting one's gizzards to rumbling.For those who are interested, yes we are talking about the brown turtle trying to make an appearance from within the chocolate starfish...What's worse - I lost all the wisdom that usually graces the prefatory paras, so we're left with poo-jokes...
