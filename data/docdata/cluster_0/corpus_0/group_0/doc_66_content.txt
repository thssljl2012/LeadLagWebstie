 (Adelaide Now  Meredith Booth)The Australian dollar will reach parity with the U.S. dollar in September then overtake it for a few months, a currency expert with Australias largest bank said yesterday.As Australias currency soared to a 25-year high today, trading at US97.64c triggered by a surging gold price, Commonwealth Bank chief currency strategist Richard Grace expected it to soon surpass the greenback on strong income from Australias exports and an ailing U.S. economy.At 1700 AEST, the Australian dollar was trading at 97.77 US cents, up from yesterdays close of 96.80 US cents.It was the local currencys highest closing level since January 25, 1983  in the days of a fixed exchange rate  when the Australian dollar ended the local session at 97.90 US cents.Our thinking is it will spend three months beyond parity ... its not just a U.S. dollar story, we think the Aussie will appreciate across the board with the pound the yen and the euro, Mr. Grace said. We have got a very strong Australian dollar story; weve got an investment boom going on in this economy and we think the Aussie dollar is adjusting to export and import prices and strong terms of trade, he said.
