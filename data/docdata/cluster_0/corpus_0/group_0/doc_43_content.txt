    A Scout is never taken by surprise; he knows exactly what to do when anything unexpected happens.&amp;#8221;                                   Last week's terror strikes failed to have any major impact on market sentiment. The main indices managed to advance after a choppy session. The rally seemed to taper off towards the close amid anxiety over today's RBI policy meeting. Weakness in European markets also may have prompted the bulls to turn a little cautious. And, rightly so. Wall Street witnessed another big sell-off amid nagging worries over the US financial sector and its impact on the world's biggest economy. Asian markets this morning are down 2-3.5%.  FIIs were net sellers of over Rs7bn (provisional) yesterday. Given this kind of a backdrop, we expect a soft opening in our market.                   Trading may turn volatile ahead of the RBI's quarterly policy announcement around  noon. A small hike in either Repo Rate or CRR is on the cards, and has already been discounted by the markets. Having said that,                    RBI Governor Y.V. Reddy has this habit of springing a surprise almost every                   time. It remains to be seen if he does it again today.  Even if he does, hopefully the surprise will be on the positive side for banks and the markets. So be ready with your picks because Dr. Reddy seems more steady for now.
