 &amp;nbsp;Weekly Wrap&amp;nbsp; The stock market&amp;nbsp;was unable&amp;nbsp;to build on the prior week's gains, but it wasn't for a lack of trying.&amp;nbsp; In turn, it wasn't because it lacked catalysts either.Oil prices slipped another 4.7% to $123.34 per barrel, the financial sector was up as much as 10.6% at its high for the week, earnings news was generally better than expected (or feared in some cases), and Congress, by all accounts, was on the verge of passing a housing bill that the president already said he would sign into law.The surge in financials early in the week stemmed from a continuing sense of relief that there wasn't another round of dilutive capital raising efforts and the idea that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac weren't going to be allowed to fail.Bank of America kicked off the reporting for the financial sector this week and it did so a relatively good note, offering an indication that its intention is to maintain its current dividend.&amp;nbsp; In contrast, Wachovia, Regions Financial, and Fifth Third all cut their dividend, yet none signaled that they would have to raise more capital through a stock offering.The enthusiasm toward the financial stocks&amp;nbsp;ended in a hurry on Thursday, though,&amp;nbsp;when the sector dropped 6.8% and suffered its largest decline in more than eight years.&amp;nbsp; The thinking that the sector had gone too far, too, fast, coupled with the return of worries about the sector's financial condition, which followed many reports of large increases to provisions for loan losses, led to the reversal of fortune.&amp;nbsp; From its high on Wednesday to its close on Friday, the sector dropped 9.7%.From our vantage point, the financial sector pullback should not have been seen as a surprise.&amp;nbsp; The sheer magnitude of&amp;nbsp;its short-term&amp;nbsp;advance made it inevitable.&amp;nbsp; The pullback in the financials was a major drag on the broader market during the same period.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A pickup in concerns about a global economic slowdown, which were fed by weak data out of Europe,&amp;nbsp;the hangover of&amp;nbsp;major earnings disappointments from American Express and Texas Instruments, cautious guidance from Apple, and&amp;nbsp;a horrendous earnings report from Ford kept buying efforts in check.The troubles for the auto industry came to light further on Friday when it was noted Chrysler Financial will no longer offer leases because it is unable to do so on competitive terms.&amp;nbsp; General Motors, in turn, indicated July sales in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;are expected to be similar to last month, which was accented by a 15% decline.Notwithstanding the earnings disappointments from select companies, the earnings news outside the financial sector has been better than expected.&amp;nbsp; According to Bloomberg, second quarter earnings, ex-financial, are tracking to be up 8.6% as opposed to down 18.2% when financials are included.&amp;nbsp; This understanding has provided a rational rallying point and an important source of support for the market, which had gotten overly pessimistic about earnings (as it typically does) ahead of the reporting period.Of the 248 S&amp;amp;P 500 companies that have reported their results, 72.2% have registered positive surprises, 4.8% have been in line, and 23.0% have missed expectations.&amp;nbsp; Thomson Reuters&amp;nbsp;informs us that over the past eight quarters, 66% of companies beat estimates, 12% matched and 22% missed estimates.Still, the market is pre-occupied with fears about the consumer.&amp;nbsp; Accordingly, it has been unable to put its full faith in earnings estimates for the back half of the year that call for growth in both the third and fourth quarters -- including financials.&amp;nbsp;Weak housing data has contributed to those fears.&amp;nbsp; On Thursday the National Association of Realtors reported existing home sales in June slipped to a 10-year low, but lost in that report was the indication that the pace of sales declines is slowing.&amp;nbsp; The same is true for new home sales, which were reported to be down 0.6% in June from an upwardly revised May number.&amp;nbsp; Strikingly, June new home sales at an annual rate of 530,000 units were right in line with the 3-month average for the March to May period.&amp;nbsp; The coming week will bring another heavy slate of earnings reports and a key batch of economic data, including the advanced Q2 GDP report and the July employment report.Although nonfarm payrolls are expected to show another modest decline, Q2 GDP should be a shocker.There is enough data now, including this week's stronger-than-expected durable orders report,&amp;nbsp;to state conclusively that second quarter real GDP will increase close to a 3.0% annual rate.&amp;nbsp; That's not only above the 2.0% level that stands as the current consensus forecast, it's also a long, long way from a recession.--Patrick J.
