Today in the market, Friday, January 16, 2009: Stocks rose on Friday on strength in the energy sector and companies that hold up well in recessions, while reassuring comments from Britain&#8217;s Barclays late in the day helped financials cut losses that had driven the market lower earlier. The banking sector was in the spotlight throughout the session after a fresh $20 billion government capital injection for Bank of America revived worries about the fate of the sector. &#8220;For better or for ill, we have to at least keep the banks going,&#8221; said Paul Nolte, director of investments at Hinsdale Associates in Hinsdale Illinois. &#8220;Investors are struggling with what is happening and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re seeing the volatility.&#8221; The S&amp;P financial index .GSPF pared steep declines to end down 2.4 percent after Barclays said it expected next month to report pretax profit for 2008 &#8220;well ahead&#8221; of analysts&#8217; estimates. Barclays comments came a few hours after its shares had plummeted by 25 percent in European trade. Energy shares rose along with a rebound in the price of oil, while McDonald&#8217;s was the Dow&#8217;s biggest lift, offsetting the drag from Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.
