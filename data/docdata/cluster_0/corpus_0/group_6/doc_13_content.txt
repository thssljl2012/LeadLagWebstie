December econonic numbers are in and, as expected, they confirm that the Bush recession was in full bloom well before Obama's Inauguration. Home sales and earnings were down, and jobless claims way up. All those tax cuts for the wealthy certainly turned out to be a great thing for the economy!!!  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn...l?hpid=topnews    Quote:                    Markets Tumble on Home Sales, Jobless Claims, Earnings  By Renae Merle Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday, January 29, 2009; 4:22 PM  Wall Street lost its footing today, sending stocks tumbling amid poor economic news and weak earnings reports.  The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.7 percent, or 226 points, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.3 percent, or 29 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down about 3.2 percent, or 51 points.  The market has been buoyed recently by optimism surrounding the Obama administration's stimulus package, which passed the House late yesterday, and rallied yesterday on reports that government officials were considering the creation of entities to buy up the toxic assets weighing down financial companies.  But those gains were wiped away today. After helping lead the market higher yesterday, banking stocks tumbled. Bank of America lost 8.3 percent, and Citigroup fell 7.1 percent.  It is not unusual for investors to sell off after a rally to lock in profits, but the market was also weighed down today by more poor economic news.  "There is no good news out there today; everything is the worst its every been," said Dan Faretta, senior market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a Chicago-based trading firm.  New homes sales fell 14.7 percent in December, compared with the previous month, and about 45 percent compared with the same period last year, according to government data. That was worse than analysts expected.  Orders for big-ticket durable goods fell 2.6 percent in December, the fifth monthly decline in a row, according to Commerce Department data. Excluding defense purchases, orders fell even faster, 4.9 percent.  The "industrial recession is deep and broad and there's no prospect of any easing of the downward pressure anytime soon," Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics, said in a research note.  Workers filing for new unemployment benefits rose by 3,000 to 588,000 last week, according to the Labor Department. Although the number of initial claims was relatively steady, it exceeded analysts' expectations. Worse, analysts said, the total number of workers filing claims for jobless benefits lasting more than one week soared to 4,776,000 -- a new record.  "The rapid increase in continuing jobless claims . . . certainly suggests that the unemployment rate kept moving upward at a decent clip" in January, Abiel Reinhart, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, said in a research note this morning.  Weak earnings reports from bellwether companies also left investors nervous.  Ford was down about 3.5 percent after reporting a nearly $6 billion loss during its fourth quarter and $14.6 billion for all of 2008. Despite its deep losses, Ford said it still does not need to tap into federal aid.  Eastman Kodak Co. announced today it would cut 3,500 to 4,500 jobs and reported a $137 million fourth-quarter loss. Its stock tumbled 29.6 percent. "The second half of 2008 will go down in history as one of the most challenging periods we have seen in decades," Antonio M. Perez, Eastman's chief executive, said in a statement. During "the last three months of the year, we experienced dramatic declines in several of our key businesses due to the slowdown in consumer spending and significantly reduced demand for capital equipment."  Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research lowered its earnings outlook for the firm and its target stock price. "Given current consumer confidence and spending levels, we see little reason for a dramatic improvement this year," Erik Kolb, a S&amp;P analyst, said in a research note.  Crude oil prices fell 1.7 percent to $41.44 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Overseas stocks were mixed. The FTSE in London closed down 2.5 percent, while the Dax in Germany fell 2 percent. Japan's Nikkei was up 1.8 percent.
