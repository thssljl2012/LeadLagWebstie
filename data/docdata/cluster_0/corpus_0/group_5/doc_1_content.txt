Yesterday the Australian shares ended flat as weaker Commonwealth Bank and energy stocks weighed on the market. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 10.6 points, or 0.3 per cent, at 3,581.2, while the broader All Ordinaries index gained 6.7 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 3,521.7. It could be fairly quiet during the pre-Christmas sessions. But the local market may be hit by the dropping commodities prices and the fears on US auto industry as US government has admitted that orderly bankruptcy can be one of the options for the troubled automakers.
