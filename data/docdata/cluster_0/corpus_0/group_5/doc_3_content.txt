Oil prices have fallen below $40 a barrel, a 4 year low, despite OPEC announcing that it would cut production by 2.2 million barrels a day.  Thursday afternoon saw crude oil trading below $36 a barrel, says Bloomberg. JP Morgan chase is warning that the possibility of $25 barrels of oil in the future is "hard to dismiss." JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., the largest U.S. bank by assets, reduced its 2009 average oil price forecast to $43 a barrel from $69 as a global economic slowdown causes a contraction in demand. The prospect of oil falling to $25 is hard to dismiss amid a serious deterioration of economic conditions and building stocks, the bank said in a report released yesterday.
