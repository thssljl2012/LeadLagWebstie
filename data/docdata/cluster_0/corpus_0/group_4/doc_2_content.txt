The US stock market yesterday traded on either side of unchanged the entire day and finished mixed (Dow -0.06%, S&amp;P 500 -0.25%, Nasdaq Composite +0.31%).       Bearish factors for stock prices yesterday included (1) the larger-than-expected drop in the Oct ISM manufacturing index to a 26-year low, (2) the Fed's quarterly loan survey which said large businesses faced the tightest lending standards on record over the past three months as the risks of a deeper slowdown increased in the wake of the financial turmoil in Sep and Oct, (3) comments from Richmond Fed President Lacker that falling US economic growth and rising unemployment may further erode banks' willingness to lend to consumers and businesses, (4) comments from Dallas Fed President Fisher that he sees no US economic growth through 2009 and that we're "not out of the woods yet" even as interbank lending rates fall, and (5) the surge in US bankruptcies in Oct which topped 100,000 for the first time since bankruptcy laws were tightened three years ago.       Bullish factors for stock prices yesterday included (1) the predicton by Citigroup that Intel and other semiconductor makers may return 43% over the next year and outperform the overall stock market in the next 12 months, (2) the continued decline in interbank lending rates with the 3-month dollar Libor rate falling to its lowest level since Lehman Brothers collapsed on Sep 15, and (3) speculation that the stock market may rally if Senator Obama is elected President as the Dow since 1900 rose by an average 9.8% in the 12 months after the Democratic Party captured the White House with only two exceptions (in 1912 for President Wilson and in 1976 for President Carter).       MasterCard is trading sharply higher by 9% in European trading this morning after reporting stronger-than-expected Q3 EPS ex-items of $2.47 per share, which was substantially better than the market consensus of $2.22 per share.      Today's U.S. Market Focus          December 10-year T-notes this morning are trading -7 ticks due to higher S&amp;Ps and European stocks. December T-note prices yesterday closed +23 ticks. Bullish factors for T-note prices yesterday included (1) the weaker-than-expected Oct ISM manufacturing index that fell to a 26-year low (-4.6 to 38.9 versus expectations of -2.5 to 41.0), (2) the weaker-than expected new orders sub-index of the Oct ISM manufacturing index which dropped to a 28-year low of 32.2, (3) reduced inflation concerns as the ISM prices-paid sub-index plunged to a 6-3/4 year low (-13.5 to 37.0 versus expectations of -4.5 to 49.0), (4) comments from Dallas Fed President Fisher that he sees no US economic growth through 2009 and that it is clear that in September price pressures "screeched to a halt," and (5) comments from Richmond Fed President Lacker that "the deterioration of economic conditions is playing a more prominent role in the tightening of credit terms right now than the direct effects of financial-market turbulence." Bearish factors ror T-note prices yesterday included (1) the US Treasury's statement that it will need to borrow $550 billion in the three months to Dec 31 compared with the $142 billion it predicted in July as weaker economic growth and the costs of a bank rescue package swell the budget deficit, (2) the prediction by Goldman Sachs that the next US president may find foreign investors unable to absorb a growing supply of Treasury bonds as the financial crisis prompts nations to invest in their own banks and currencies, pushing bond yields higher, and (3) the prediction by Morgan Stanley that the US yield curve may steepen substantially and grow to 3.00 points by the end of Q1 2009 as shorter-term securities "will continued to be anchored by monetary poicy and the long end will sell off on increased supply."       The dollar/yen this morning is up +0.38 yen. The euro/dollar is up +1.21 cents as the dollar suffers from reduced safe-haven buying. The dollar index yesterday ended the day higher.

Bearish factors for the dollar yesterday included (1) the weaker-than-expected US Oct ISM manufacturing index which tumbled to a 26-year low, and (2) the continued decline in interbank lending rates as the 3-month dollar Libor rate fell to its lowest level since the failure of Lehman Brothers on Sep 15, reducing the demand for dollars.                   December crude oil prices this morning are trading +31 cents a barrel and December gasoline is trading +0.76 cents a gallon. The main bullish factor this morning is the weaker dollar versus the euro.
