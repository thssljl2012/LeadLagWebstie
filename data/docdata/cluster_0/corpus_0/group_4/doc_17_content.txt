 LONDON (AFP) 04/11/08 The dollar fell against the euro and yen on Tuesday as Americans voted to elect a new president of the United States, the world&amp;#8217;s biggest economy which is on the brink of recession. In London morning trading, the euro rose to 1.2713 dollars from 1.2643 late in New York on Monday. Against the Japanese currency, the dollar fell to 98.99 yen from 99.13 on Monday. &amp;#8220;It is clear that whoever wins today&amp;#8217;s (Tuesday&amp;#8217;s) US presidential election, the focus in the early part of the victor&amp;#8217;s term in office will be on reviving the US economy,&amp;#8221; said Derek Halpenny, European head of global currency research at The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in London. Americans opened the voting in their historic election, with front-running Democrat Barack Obama seeking to become the first black president and his Republican rival John McCain hoping for a poll-defying comeback. &amp;#8220;We will see the actual results here on Wednesday, but investors have high expectations for the president-elect to come up with more action on the economy,&amp;#8221; said Saburo Matsumoto, chief forex strategist at Sumitomo Trust Bank. &amp;#8220;The election to decide the next US president will bring a sense of stability to its economy,&amp;#8221; he said. Dealers said investors were reassured by rebounding stock markets and rate cuts last week by major economies including the United States and Japan. &amp;#8220;Investors welcome the rate cuts and the rising share prices,&amp;#8221; said Masatsugu Miyata, forex dealer at Hachijuni Bank. Speculation is growing that the European Central Bank and the Bank of England could follow suit this week with sharp rate cuts of their own. The Australian dollar tumbled by more than 2.5 percent from Monday to 0.6634 US dollars after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates by a larger-than-expected 75 basis points to 5.25 percent amid concerns of a slowdown. The Australian dollar, which is higher yielding than most other major currencies, has already taken a beating during the economic crisis. In morning trading here on Tuesday, the euro changed hands at 1.2713 dollars against 1.2643 late Monday, at 125.85 yen (125.30), 0.8037 pounds (0.7990) and 1.4873 Swiss francs (1.4841). The dollar stood at 98.99 yen (99.13) and 1.1701 Swiss francs (1.1743). The pound was at 1.5814 dollars (1.5813). On the London Bullion Market, the price of gold increased to 730.49 dollars an ounce from 729.50 dollars late on Monday. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
