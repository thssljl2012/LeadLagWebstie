 The following is interesting....what I gathered from it is this: part of the cripling of the working joe economy is the price of fuel (which raises the cost of EVERYTHING...let alone mid class countries that can afford to buy food but can't afford the gas to ship it in).&amp;nbsp; To counteract the exhorbitant prices, consumers are using less (carpooling/public transit/no excess driving/walking/biking etc), which is good for the enviroment, saves money, eases conjestion on the roads.&amp;nbsp; Since demand is now far below supply, the ridiculous prices are dropping.&amp;nbsp; Am I wrong to see this as a GOOD thing?&amp;nbsp; Haven't we for YEARS been going on and on about our gluttonous consumption of energy?&amp;nbsp; On freeing ourselves from middle east oil by reducing our frivilous use of a finite resource?&amp;nbsp; On reducing our fuel use to combat pollution and global warming and the disasterous effects it has on our one and only home?&amp;nbsp; You think there'd be someone shouting "hooray we're on the right track!&amp;nbsp; We're learning to conserve and the prices are going down yadda yadda!"&amp;nbsp; No we get reports on the drop of oil cost like it's a fucking crisis "LOOK how low it is!" even tho gas is STILL crippling at above the mid three dollar range.&amp;nbsp; "OMG look at our surplus OMG the western oil pigs aren't trampling each other to the trough.....let's cut production.&amp;nbsp; That'll teach 'em." Am I wrong to think that a fair combination to ourselves and the world around us is a combination of reduction/conservation/alternative fuels or transport compounded with fair affordable prices to keep the cost of living in check?&amp;nbsp; I think that's fair, I dont' think that it's unreasonable.&amp;nbsp; We dont' use as much, the demand is lower so due to supply and demand the price lowers, everything is more affordable, more people have that extra couple hundred bucks in their pocket,&amp;nbsp; companies that rely on gas powered shipping (for now) can afford to do business, everybody wins, right? I think that the gas prices was a good hard tonic for gluttonous Americans.&amp;nbsp; It made us rethink how we use, how we do things, WHY we do things, our love affair with motors and excess.&amp;nbsp; Even I changed my habits.&amp;nbsp; I recycle, I conserved compared to everyone else, I keep my thermostat low and my unused appliances unplugged or off.&amp;nbsp; But I was going to the store every day.&amp;nbsp; I was going on joy drives.&amp;nbsp; I had no compunctions driving an hour to work and back every day.&amp;nbsp;  Now I shop every two weeks, in bulk, no side trips, I do everything in one trip and stay home, I work 5 min from my house.&amp;nbsp; I used to have to fill up 5 times a month.&amp;nbsp; Now if I'm really careful I can go almost a month on one tank.&amp;nbsp; It made ME look at how wasteful I was, even tho I thought I was little miss greenie.&amp;nbsp; I can't imagine the impact it made on others.&amp;nbsp;  People have done so well, even if it was money that forced their hand.&amp;nbsp; Here's how we're rewarded. Now the oil companies are sweating it that they aren't making the extra billions they were making on top of their previous billions from before when they were price gouging us into poverty.&amp;nbsp; It's taking the power out of the hands of the people that crave it the most, and that frightens them.&amp;nbsp; We've not shaken off the shackles of dependence, but we've loosened the noose, which isn't satisfactory aparently.&amp;nbsp; So they're talking of cutting production of oil to drive the price right back up.&amp;nbsp; What, you weren't making enough billions when it was $50 a barrel?&amp;nbsp; Oh, excuse me, what am I thinking.&amp;nbsp; I'm so selfish.&amp;nbsp; Stupid selfish lady, conserving like I'm trying to do. The following I got off Yahoo, and is sort of dry, but well it pissed me off.&amp;nbsp; Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but maybe more people need to look between the lines. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; By STEVENSON JACOBS, AP Business Writer 1 hour, 7 minutes ago  .. --&gt; end storyhdr --&gt; NEW YORK - Oil prices closed at their lowest level in two weeks Thursday, tumbling below $94 a barrel on doubts that a revamped financial bailout plan will be enough to avoid a protracted economic slump and revive dwindling U.S. energy demand. .. --&gt; SpaceID=8903535 loc=LREC noad --&gt; .. language=javascript&gt; if(window.yzq_d==null)window.yzq_d=new Object(); window.yzq_d['4Ru8AEwNBlI-']='&amp;U=12cdk3051%2fN%3d4Ru8AEwNBlI-%2fC%3d-1%2fD%3dLREC%2fB%3d-1%2fV%3d0'; ..&gt; ..&gt;..&gt; The declines came a day after the Senate overwhelmingly approved the rescue package. The bill now goes to the House of Representatives for an expected vote Friday; House lawmakers stunned investors Monday by rejecting the bailout plan, although Senators added $100 billion in tax breaks and other sweeteners in a bid to win over enough dissenting House votes. Even if the plan wins approval, oil market traders are skeptical that it will steady the teetering U.S. economy and reverse flagging demand for energy in the world's largest consumer. The plan would remove billions of dollars in bad mortgages and other toxic debt from the books of banks and other financial firms, though critics argue it doesn't go far enough to help ordinary Americans struggling with soaring costs for food and fuel and falling home prices. "I think the oil market believes that no size of a rescue plan is going to be enough to stave off a recession," said Addison Armstrong, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Conn. He said government data released Thursday showing a slowdown in U.S. manufacturing and growing unemployment suggest that a drop in U.S. energy demand "is going to accelerate as we head into a steeper recession." Light, sweet crude for November delivery fell $4.56 to settle at $93.97 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was crude's lowest settlement since Sept. 16. Prices earlier jumped as high as $100.37 but eased back later as traders digested the details of the revised bailout package. The November crude contract fell $2.11 to settle at $98.53 on Wednesday. Oil prices have fallen about $15, or 13 percent, in the past month as investor concerns about waning global energy consumption outweigh threats to supplies caused by Gulf Coast hurricanes and militant attacks in Nigeria. The slump in energy demand has accelerated beyond the U.S. In India, domestic oil product sales totaled 2.41 million barrels per day in August, the lowest level this year, according to Barclays Capital research. In the same month, Japan's oil demand fell by 8.4 percent. Significant gains over the past days by the dollar against the euro have also helped push down prices. Investors tend to buy commodities like oil to defend against dollar weakness and a hedge against inflation, but return to the U.S. currency as it strengthens. The 15-nation euro bought $1.3833 in trading Thursday, down from $1.4061 in the previous session. Meanwhile, statistics from the U.S. Labor Department released Thursday showed more signs of a weakening economy, adding to concerns about falling oil demand. The Labor Department reported that initial claims for jobless benefits increased by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 497,000, significantly above analysts' estimate of 475,000. The total is the highest since just after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks seven years ago. Also Thursday, the Commerce Department said factory orders in August plunged by 4 percent compared to July, a much steeper decline than the 2.5 percent drop analysts expected and the biggest setback since a 4.8 percent plunge in October 2006. Recent data shows that U.S. fuel demand is falling while supplies rise. The Energy Department's Energy Information Administration said Wednesday in its weekly report that crude stocks rose by 4.3 million barrels, or 1.5 percent, to 294.5 million barrels for the week ending Sept. 26. Analysts had expected stocks to rise or fall of 1.5 million barrels, according to a survey by energy research firm Platts. At the same time, gasoline inventories rose by 900,000 barrels, or 0.5 percent, to 179.6 million barrels. Analysts expected stockpiles of the motor fuel to fall in the range of 1 million to 3 million barrels. Fuel consumption for the four-week period ended Sept. 26 reached about 19 million barrels a day, down 7 percent from the same period a year ago, according to the EIA.  "The demand just isn't there," said Jonathan Kornafel, Asia director for market maker Hudson Capital Energy in Singapore. "The refineries aren't buying crude to turn it into gasoline because consumers aren't buying it on the road."  Kornafel predicted oil prices will trade between $80 and $90 during the next few months, with oil producers likely to cut production if prices fall further.  ___
