Now RBA has also cut its rates. It says: Given the opposing forces at work, considerable uncertainty has surrounded the outlook for demand and inflation. On balance, however, it is looking more likely that household demand will remain subdued and overall economic growth slow over the period ahead.  Inflation is likely to remain relatively high in the short term, with the CPI affected by the high global oil prices in mid year and other increases in raw materials prices.  But looking further ahead, the outlook for demand suggests that inflation in both CPI and underlying terms is likely to decline over time, provided wages growth remains contained. The Banks forecast remains that inflation will fall below 3 per cent during 2010. So much so for inflation targeting. Just like RBNZ, BoE RBA also cuts rates despite expecting inflation to be higher. It says it expects demand to slow down and this would dampen inflation. It also says &amp;#8220;wages growth remains contained&amp;#8221;. How will wages be contained? I am not sure what is going on. Ignore inflation at your peril.
