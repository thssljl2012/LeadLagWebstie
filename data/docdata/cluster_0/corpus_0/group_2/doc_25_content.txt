 By GEORGE JAHN, Associated Press Writer  VIENNA, Austria AP)  Oil prices plummeted Tuesday, falling briefly below $92 a barrel and reflecting market fears that the U.S. credit crisis which brought down brokerage giant Lehman Brothers will drag on global economic growth and restrain demand for crude.

The 13-nation group said oil demand in the U.S. fell by 800,000 barrels a day last month due to the slow economy and high retail prices.

For next year, the report predicted that world demand will grow by 900,000 barrels a day, to a daily 87.7 million barrels.
