http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/sep/18/marketturmoil.commodities Banking crisis: Investors pile into gold and bonds Mark Tran   September 18, 2008 As the world&amp;#8217;s central banks pumped billions of dollars into the markets in a bid to restore confidence, investors were piling into gold and government bonds, traditionally safe havens at times of financial turmoil. Although the FTSE 100 showed signs of steadying after Lloyds TSB announced its bid for HBOS, demand for safe-haven assets was still high. Gold rose as much as 3% to a more than six-week high, extending its biggest ever one-day rise as investors rushed to the safety of bullion in what Alan Greenspan, the former head of the US Federal Reserve, called a &amp;#8220;once in a century&amp;#8221; financial crisis. Spot gold rose 1.1%, or $9.60, to $872.30 an ounce from its close in New York yesterday, when it surged more than 10% or nearly $90, exceeding the previous biggest one-day gain in 1980. At one point gold jumped more than 3% to as high as $892.10 an ounce - the highest since August 5 - with a burst of demand from Japanese investors.  (more&amp;#8230;)
