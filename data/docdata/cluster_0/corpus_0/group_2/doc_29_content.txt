This afternoon, sitting in my mailbox was an offer from Bank of America - for a home mortgage.MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA....Meanwhile, in the rest of the world, the wave continues - on its way back to us again...The Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 index fell 580 points, a loss of 4.94% of its value in a matter of minutes. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 5.47% in the first 10 minutes of trading. Australia and New Zealand saw similar losses, with the S&amp;P/ASX-200 index shedding 5.3% in Sydney and a 4.7% fall in Wellington. Earlier, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva accused the US and other wealthy nations of financial irresponsibility that could jeopardise the economic progress made in recent years by developing countries. Brazil's Ibovespa stock index dropped 9.4% on Monday.I expect the market may actually rebound a bit tomorrow, as folks start bargain hunting - but apparently Bush is going on TV again in the morning, and who knows what crazy shit he'll say?  The mere fact that the President has chosen to address this issue twice in one week, combined with the news from the foreign markets, might keep investors spooked.
