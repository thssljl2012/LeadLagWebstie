   Asia Markets BriefForbes.com staff 09.02.08,     11:31 AM ETAsian stocks mostly took a lather Tuesday, not so much on political instability--though that dominated the headlines in Japan and Thailand--as on general weakness in Asian markets. The fall in crude prices, rather than easing inflationary concerns, had the effect of drilling oil-related stocks, which led the bourses lower. Light, sweet crude had fallen to $106.03 a barrel by the conclusion of Asian trading hours Tuesday, a drop of nearly $10 from the Friday closing price, before the United States took its Labor Day holiday.The sudden resignation Monday evening of Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, who had spent less than a year in office, had little effect on investor sentiment beyond a slight lift in the morning, as traders had more or less assumed political change from recent poll data. Trading volume remained light, as some investors were waiting for a clearer picture of a successor government's economic policy. Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Taro Aso is expected to be a strong candidate to succeed Fukuda. "Even if Aso comes to power, it is quite likely that it will only be an interim government, so this will be difficult for the stock market to digest," commented Tsuyoshi Segawa, an equity strategist at Shinko Securities.The Nikkei 225 index floated as high as 12,920.52 in the morning but turned sharply lower in the afternoon, finishing the day 1.75% down, at 12,609.47, a five-month low. The broader Topix tumbled 1.5%, to 1,212.37. Among oil-related stocks, exploration firm Inpex Holdings swooned by 6.7%, to 1,070,000 yen ($9,805.72), while trading house Marubeni drooped by 4.9%, to 626 yen ($5.74).Financial stocks gave up early big gains and then some. Mizuho Financial Group lost 1.1%, to 456,000 yen ($4,188.29). Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group stepped back 0.6%, to 650,000 yen ($5,968.50), and Nomura Holdings pared big early gains to advance 1.1%, to 1,439 yen ($13.22). Tire maker Bridgestone, rolled ahead by 1.65%, to 1,848 yen ($16.98), but, again, this was after having tasted much larger morning increases.A more volatile instability reigned in Thailand. The unpopular Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej declared a state of emergency in Bangkok on Tuesday, after anti-government protests turned into violent clashes, which killed at least one man and injured 37 others overnight. Although Samak said the state of emergency would not last for more than a few days, Thailand's SET 50 index dropped 2.7%, to 465.32."The escalating political uncertainties--in view of the stand-off between protesters and the country's coalition government--do pose a threat to not only the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej, but also to long-term economic stability," said Thomas Byrne, a Singapore-based senior vice president in Moody's sovereign risk unit. Despite the political uncertainties, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index moved higher by 0.65%, to 21,042.46. Airlines and China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) (up 3.2%, to 7.53 Hong Kong dollars [96 cents]) gained, while offshore oil exploration firm CNOOC (down 5.2%, to 11.38 Hong Kong dollars [$1.46]) and Lenovo (down 4.0%, to 4.76 Hong Kong dollars [61 cents]) lost ground. The Shanghai Composite index lost 0.9%, to 2,304.89. South Korea's KOSPI index dropped 0.5%, to 1,407.14, with financials slipping on state-owned Korea Development Bank's confirmation hat it entered into talks about possibly taking over Lehman Brothers as part of a consortium of banks. (See "KDB Admits Having Had A Chat About Lehman.") Shares of Woori Finance led the decliners, sinking 6.3%, to 12,600 won ($11.27), almost a three-year low. Shinhan Financial skidded 1.0%, to 47,550 ($42.52) won, while Hana Financial dropped 2.6%, to 37,000 won ($33.09). Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 was essentially flat, inching down by 0.05%, to 5,116.00; the broader All Ordinaries index was barely off, by 0.1%, at 5,195.00. The Reserve Bank of Australia lowered a key interest rate by 25 basis points, to 7.0%, the first such cut in seven years. Elsewhere, Taiwan's Taiex weighted index fell off by 1.7%, to 6,699.82, while the Straits Times index in Singapore did the opposite, gaining 1.7%, to 2758.94. The Bombay Stock Exchange's Sensex index had a banner day, up 3.8%, to 15,049.86. --Thomson Financial and the Associated Press contributed to this article.
