  these guys are still all over the map, by end of 2009 some are predicting$8000/ton (3.60/lb) and others at $6600/ton (3.00/lb) and still others are expecting prices to reamin as low as $5000/ton ($2.27/lb)   ajax should be profitable at $1.50/lb as long as costs dont continue higher, and if commodity prices keep dropping then costs for fuel and construction will also be lower  the economics for the central BC copper mines should be OK no matter what happens to copper prices and capex/opex costs unless world economic activity grinds to a halt for many yrs (I dont see that happening)  the big challenge now is financiing and control of dilution  **********************************************************  Coppers Achilles heel   http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/40b4cb20-916d-11dd-b5cd-0000779fd18c.html   The price of copper capped a torrid third quarter on Friday with the second largest weekly fall for the benchmark London Metal Exchange three-month contract, 11.8 per cent to $5,977.5 a tonne.  Stephen Briggs, of RBS, says persistent supply disruptions had initially allowed copper to play Houdini and escape the price routs afflicting other base metals this year.  Mr Briggs says this weeks fall has exposed coppers Achilles heel, prompting hedge funds to liquidate long positions (bets on price gains) based on the realisation that the market is heading for a supply surplus.  Selling pressure has come partly from macroeconomic-focused hedge funds, which have been concerned about the growing threat of the financial crisis spilling over into a global recession.  This has helped drag copper prices down 33.1 per cent in just three months from a record $8,930 a tonne at the start of July.  Shortly after the July price peak, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission indicated hedge funds had changed position from net long (betting on prices rising) to net short (betting on prices falling).  Analysts have been chopping their price forecasts. This week, Citigroup cut its 2009 price forecast by 23.2 per cent from $10,472 a tonne to $8,047 a tonne.  China, as the worlds largest consumer, remains important to coppers fortunes.  Alan Heap, analyst at Citigroup, says Chinese copper wire demand (more than 80 per cent of total demand) has been affected by slower growth in electricity generating capacity  He says growth in this sector is likely to benefit from any government fiscal stimulus. He warns that the outlook for prices in the next two years is highly uncertain as supply disruptions globally have shown no sign of easing.  China was largely absent from most commodity markets in the weeks before the Olympics and some traders expected a rise in Chinese demand after the games.  This week, Chinese buyers have again been absent due to public holidays, but they return on Monday to face mounting evidence, in manufacturing and housing, that the economy is slowing.  Kevin Norrish, of Barclays Capital, who has just returned from a field trip to China, says demand in key Chinese sectors (the export market, automobiles and construction) is very soft.  Barclays says copper prices could test the $5,226 a tonne low of early 2007 and is forecasting that prices will average $5,500 a tonne in the fourth quarter, descending to $5,000 a tonne in the first quarter of 2009 before recovering to $8,000 by the final quarter of 2009.  Analysts at Macquarie forecast that the copper market will have a surplus of 271,000 tonnes this year rising to 474,000 tonnes in 2009, in spite of substantial losses from mine production. We expect copper prices to come under downward pressure over the next few months and in 2009, they say.  It is forecasting cash copper prices to average $7,863 a tonne this year and to fall 15.9 per cent to $6,614 a tonne in 2009.
