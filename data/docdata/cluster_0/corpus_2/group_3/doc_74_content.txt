LONDON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - British gilts rose on Monday    supported by weak industrial data which showed manufacturers    expect to cut output by the sharpest rate in nearly 30 years.    The Confederation of British Industry said confidence in the    manufacturing sector has also plummeted and more than 60,000    jobs could disappear before the end of the year.    At 1233 GMT the December gilt future was up by 13    ticks to 110.86, pushing yields across the curve down. Yields on    ten-year gilts were 2 basis points lower.    Waeker equities were also supporting government bond    markets, with the FTSE 100 down 0.6 percent.    &amp;#039;The CBI survey heightens the case for the Bank of England    to cut interest rates aggressively again in November, we expect    to see another 50 basis points cut from 4.50 percent to 4.00    percent,&amp;#039; Howard Archer, Chief Economist at Global Insight said.    Earlier in the session the Debt Management Office (DMO)    auctioned 4.75 billion pounds of 2011 4.25 percent gilts, which    received healthy demand of 2.29 times cover.    Investors will also take cues from the BoE Governor Mervyn    King when he speaks at the Royal Armouries in Leeds, ahead of an    auction of 2018 gilts due on Thursday.    &amp;#039;The acid test for the market will actually be the 18s issue    on Thursday because that will come after the (BoE) minutes and    after the Governor&amp;#039;s speech,&amp;#039; Moyeen Islam, gilts strategist at    Barclays Capital said.    Short sterling was down across the strip with the December    contract losing 7 ticks to 95.320.    * Dec gilt 110.86 (+0.13)    * Dec short sterling 95.32 (-0.07)    --------------------- KEY MARKET DATA---------------------------    Long Gilt futures   Gilt benchmark chain    Short Stg futures   Cash market quotes    Deposit rates          Sterling cross rates    UK debt speedguide Econ. indicator polls    --------------------KEY MARKET REPORTS--------------------------    Gilts                  Sterling    Euro Debt          Dollar    U.S. Treasuries        Debt reports    -------------------- GILT STRIPS DATA --------------------------    Gilt strips data    All gilt strips    Gilt strips IO    Gilt strips PO    A list of all the strippable British gilts    --------------------- FOR MORE NEWS ----------------------------    Top British news        World news    UK diary              Press reviews    New from Reuters    Useful Speedguides    Keywords: MARKETS BRITAIN GILTS    tf.TFN-Europe_newsdesk@thomsonreuters.com    cmr    COPYRIGHT    Copyright Thomson Financial News Limited 2008.
