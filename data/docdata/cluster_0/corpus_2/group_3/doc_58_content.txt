TOKYO, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan pledged to maintain market stability on Tuesday, as it kept interest rates unchanged and stuck with its view that the economy was sluggish.    In a widely expected move, the central bank maintained its overnight call rate target at 0.5 percent by a unanimous vote, although markets see a one-third chance of a rate cut by the end of the year.    ***********************************  ****************************    COMMENTARY    OSAMU TAKASHIMA, CHIEF CURRENCY ANALYST, BANK OF TOKYO-MITSUBISHI UFJ    &amp;#039;I think the chances of a BOJ rate cut are small. It may cut rates in tandem with the Fed and the ECB, but only if the yen strengthens sharply, say, to around 90 yen per dollar.&amp;#039;    &amp;#039;I think financial markets are underestimating the U.S. bailout package and other measures taken by authorities. But as you can see from market reaction after the Reserve Bank of Australia&amp;#039;s rate cut, risk appetite will gradually return.&amp;#039;    MARKET REACTION    -- For yen updates click, for prices click    -- For JGB updates click, for prices click    -- For stocks click, for the Nikkei share average click     BACKGROUND    -- The BOJ has joined other central banks in injecting extra funds into the money market to ease the strain of the global credit crunch, although damage to Japan&amp;#039;s banking sector has been relatively small so far.    -- The BOJ has maintained a neutral bias on monetary policy, saying that it was focusing on the risk of slowing economic growth in the near term and accelerating inflation in the long run.    -- The central bank has kept monetary policy on hold since raising its key target rate from 0.25 percent in February last year.    -- The BOJ&amp;#039;s policy board currently has two vacancies, including one for a deputy governor.
