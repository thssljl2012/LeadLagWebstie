The realistic one was Xstrata, the most acquisitive mining group in  the world pulling its $US11 billion ($A12.6 billion) bid for Lonmin,  the big platinum miner based in South Africa, but headquartered in  London.    In Australia, BHP Billiton welcomed the decision  by the competition regulator not to block its 3.4 share bid for Rio  Tinto, and BHP and Rio shares stormed higher.    A case of desperate investors here not understanding the changes happening overseas, or eternal optimists, led by the BHP board?    Xstrata  said it does not intend to make a takeover offer for Lonmin because of  &amp;quot;extreme volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets&amp;quot;.    The  &amp;quot;lack of clarity and certainty regarding the future availability of  credit introduces significant risks&amp;#039;&amp;#039; into financing for any bid,  Switzerland-based Xstrata said in a statement.    Xstrata is  believed to have lined up a $US15 billion (around $A19 billion) loan  from a group of banks to finance its proposed 33 pounds ($A73-a-share)  offer and refinance existing debt.    Xstrata had to commit to the bid by tonight, our time, or withdraw. It chose the latter staged a very prudent retreat.    After  pulling the bid, it snapped up more than 14% of Lonmin for just over 19  pounds a share &amp;amp;nbsp;and now has an all but controlling 33%.    It&amp;#039;s not the only big international bid to have been killed off by the credit crunch and lending freeze.    Last  month a private equity group called off a $A4.2 billion offer for UK  events publisher, Informa and HSBC bailed out of a year-long effort to  buy 51% of the Korean Exchange Bank for $A8 billion after failing to  get the deal finalised and with worries about the global outlook.    Xstrata  had built up a 10.7% in Lonmin, but refused to buy any more, even as  its target share price sank under the proposed offer price, a good sign  of the concern Xstrata was having about the outlook for finance and for  commodities.    It snapped up the extra shares after the bid was withdrawn and Lonmin&amp;#039;s price fell.    Despite that Xstrata&amp;#039;s price fell 1.9% in London by the close.    Lonmin  replaced its CEO on Monday without warning. Ian Farmer, formerly the  chief strategic officer is the new boss and he will drive the company&amp;#039;s  review of its existing operations and performance.    Bloomberg  estimates that Xstrata has spent about $US28 billion in four years on  acquisitions, boosting sales eightfold. It has also ended attempted  transactions. The company broke off talks to buy Brazil&amp;#039;s CVRD (Vale),  the world&amp;#039;s biggest iron-ore exporter, in April. Xstrata also  terminated moves to buy Australia&amp;#039;s WMC Resources in 2005 and Canada&amp;#039;s  LionOre Mining International last year after higher bids from rivals.    In  Australia, the market was dragged higher by the news that the ACCC  would not oppose the proposed BHP Billiton bid for rival Rio Tinto    Rio  shares surged, up $A10.50, or 12.43%, at $95.00, after hitting a high  of $98.60. BHP Billiton shares were up $A1.75 or 5.6% at $32.75, after  hitting a high of $33.40. The 3.4 BHP shares for every 1 Rio share  offer was worth $111.35, a still substantial premium to the actual Rio  price and a sign of continuing market scepticism.    But BHP shares tumbled 4% in London on the Xstrata news and the worsening outlook for commodities and the global economy.    The ACCC noted that its review of the planned merger had raised &amp;quot;significant concerns&amp;quot;.    &amp;quot;While  significant concerns were raised by interested parties in Australia and  overseas, the ACCC found that the proposed acquisition would not be  likely to substantially lessen competition in any relevant market,&amp;quot;  chairman Graeme Samuel said in a statement.    BHP said in a statement:    &amp;quot;BHP  Billiton today welcomed the decision by the Australian Competition and  Consumer Commission that it does not object to BHP Billiton&amp;#039;s proposed  acquisition of Rio Tinto.    &amp;quot;We are very pleased to have received notice that the ACCC will not object to our proposed acquisition of Rio Tinto.    &amp;quot;We  have long believed in the benefits of the combination of BHP Billiton  and Rio Tinto. Our strategic rationale has always been based on the  combined company having an incentive to produce more products, more  quickly, to deliver to customers.&amp;quot; BHP Billiton&amp;#039;s Chief Commercial  Officer, Alberto Calderon, said.    &amp;quot;Confirmation that the  ACCC does not object satisfies the Australian merger control  pre-condition of BHP Billiton&amp;#039;s proposed offer for Rio Tinto. In July,  the U.S. Department of Justice also announced it would not oppose the  transaction. The offer remains subject to the pre-conditions as  disclosed in Appendix 1 of the announcement on 6 February 2008.&amp;quot;    The  ACCC said in August that market inquiries had raised concerns the  merged entity might lessen competition for iron ore and drive up prices  of the valuable commodity.    Rio Tinto is the world&amp;#039;s second biggest producer of iron ore, while BHP Billiton is the third largest.    &amp;quot;The  ACCC&amp;#039;s inquiries indicated that the merged firm would be unlikely to  limit its supply of iron ore given the uncertainty it would face in  relation to the profitability of this strategy and the risk that  limiting supply would encourage expansions by existing and new  suppliers as well sponsorship of alternative suppliers by steel  makers,&amp;quot; Mr Samuel said.    Strong opposition to the merger  has emerged from steel makers in Asia and Europe amid concerns a  combined entity could have enormous control over global iron ore and  other resource commodity prices.    &amp;quot;In relation to the  supply of iron ore in Australia, market inquiries indicated that steel  makers in Australia are unlikely to face higher iron ore lump and iron  ore fines prices, based on a move from export parity pricing to import  parity pricing,&amp;quot; Mr Samuel said.    The European Commission,  the EU&amp;#039;s antitrust regulator, resumed its assessment of the proposal  late last month after suspending its investigation in August, to await  further information from BHP Billiton.    The commission is expected to rule on the proposed transaction on January 15, 2009.    That is likely to be the deciding factor in whether the bid goes ahead.    BHP  says it has a &amp;quot;committed banking financing facility&amp;quot; from a group of  banks lead by Barclays Capital, BNP Paribas, Citigroup Global Markets,  Goldman Sachs International, HSBC, Banco Santander and UBS.    UBS  is a basket case, Santander is bedding down Alliance and Leicester and  the parts of Bradford and Bingley it bought at the weekend, Citigroup  is coping with taking over Wachovia in the US, Barclays Capital is  swallowing most of the US business of Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs  is coping with being a fully regulated bank and not an investment bank.    And on top of that, there&amp;#039;s hardly any lending going on and won&amp;#039;t be in the New Year if the bid gets the big tick and happens.
