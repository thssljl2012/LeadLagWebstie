SYDNEY, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar hovered near a one-week high against a weak U.S. dollar on Thursday which softened as the Federal Reserve lowered rates by 50 basis points to stave off the threat of a deep recession in the economy.    * The Fed also sounded bearish about the economy, contributing to the U.S. dollar&amp;#039;s biggest daily fall in 23 years [nN29457174].    * Interest rate differentials between two-year Australian and U.S. government bonds widened to 269 basis points from 256 points late here on Wednesday, making local assets a bit more attractive to investors.    * By 10:45 a.m. (2345 GMT), the Aussie had risen to $0.6715 against the U.S. dollar from $0.6363 late here on Wednesday, but dipped off a one-week high of 0.6800 struck in the offshore session.    * The Aussie was also boosted by higher commodity prices. The CRB index jumped nearly 6 percent on Wednesday, buoyed by the hefty U.S. rate cut. Australia is a major exporter of resources and recent steep falls in commodity prices have contributed to the Aussie&amp;#039;s fall to multi-year lows.    * Gains in the Aussie could be temporary, given expectations for further Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) rate cuts in the months ahead. Australian bill futures are pricing in at least 100 basis points of rate cuts by the central bank by year-end.    * However, comments from RBA Deputy Governor Ric Battellino on Thursday did see some paring back of expectations on the extent of Australian rate cuts.    * Battellino said the high level of inflation could limit room for manoeuvre on rates, though he also said that inflation was on its way down.    * The Aussie was higher against the Japanese yen, rising to 65.57 yen from 61.43 yen late here on Wednesday, but demand for leveraged trades was likely to be muted amid broad apathy towards riskier assets.    * Australian bond futures were mixed. The three-year bond futures were 0.01 points down at 95.57, while the 10-year futures contract added 0.02 points to 94.805.
