 High Yield Income Investing Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              Oil swings back above $100       STEVENSON JACOBS    The Associated Press    September 30, 2008 at 4:06 PM EDT    NEW YORK  Oil prices swung back above $100 (U.S.) a barrel Tuesday following a precipitous plunge a day earlier, with a growing consensus among investors that the U.S. Congress will resurrect a failed financial bailout plan.    Light, sweet crude for November delivery rose $4.27 to settle at $100.64 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after earlier rising as high as $101.40.    On Monday, prices fell $10.52 to settle at $96.37  the second largest drop ever in dollar terms  after U.S. legislators rejected the $700-billion bailout, stunning investors and raising fears of a long economic crisis that could dramatically curb global energy demand.    Crude has fallen about $20, or 17 per cent, in the last eight days.    Some recovery was to be expected following the fall Monday, and analysts said prices will likely remain in a holding pattern until the fate of the financial rescue plan is determined. Members of the House of Representatives were expected to reconvene in Washington on Thursday, though it&amp;#039;s unclear whether they will attempt another vote on the bailout.    Whether or not there is any agreement on a U.S. bailout, oil market watchers say global financial tremors have already forced consumers and businesses to scale back energy consumption, a trend that could take prices lower in coming weeks.    Even if the bailout gets done, it&amp;#039;s not going to solve everything immediately. The slowdown will have to work itself out for demand to take off again, Matt Zeman, head commodities trader at LaSalle Futures in Chicago.    The drop in energy demand has been especially pronounced overseas. In India, domestic oil product sales totalled 2.41 million barrels per day in August, the lowest level this year, according to Barclays Capital research. In the same month, Japan&amp;#039;s oil demand fell by 8.4 per cent.    If oil prices and energy demand keep falling, some analysts say OPEC countries may act to defend the $100 per-barrel level. The cartel earlier this month said it would reduce output by 520,000 barrels a day.    There is a chance that OPEC would cut production in coming months on the back of ongoing and potentially greater demand weakness, said Costanza Jacazio, an oil analyst with Barclays Capital in New York.    Weaker demand for fuel continues to weigh on prices at the pump.    A gallon of regular in the United States shed a penny overnight to a new U.S. average of $3.633, according to auto club AAA, the Oil Price Information Service and Wright Express. Prices hit a record average of $4.114 a gallon on July 17.    Prices are expected to fall further as U.S. Gulf energy output ramps back up after the passage of hurricanes Ike and Gustav. About 48 per cent of Gulf oil production and 47 per cent of natural gas output remained shut-in Tuesday following precautionary closures prompted by the storms, according to the U.S. Mineral Management Service.    Crude&amp;#039;s rise came despite a stronger U.S. dollar. Investors often buy crude futures as a hedge against a weakening U.S. dollar and inflation, and sell when the dollar strengthens.    On Tuesday, the euro bought $1.4059 compared with $1.4472 late Monday in New York.    In other Nymex trading, heating oil futures rose 8.22 cents to $2.8707 a gallon, while gasoline prices rose 9.8 cents to $2.49 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 22.9 cents to $7.450 per 1,000 cubic feet.    In London, November Brent crude rose $4.59 to $98.57 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange.
