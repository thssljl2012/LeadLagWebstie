 KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia  Oil prices climbed above $69 a barrel in Asia Thursday, steadily extending gains as the dollar tumbled and stock markets in the region rallied after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates to boost the world&amp;#039;s largest economy.  Light, sweet crude for December delivery was up $1.58 to $69.08 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange by late afternoon in Singapore after trading as high as $70.60.
