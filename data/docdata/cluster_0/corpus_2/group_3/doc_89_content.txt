SYDNEY, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar enjoyed a rare bounce on Friday as a last-gasp rally in U.S. stocks forced sellers to cover short positions in commodity currencies, though traders suspected it would struggle to get much further.    * The Aussie dollar clawed its way to $0.6745, having been down at $0.6527 at one stage in New York. The currency now faces resistance in the $0.6775/6795 area and is still down from $0.6887 at the end of last week.    * Likewise, the Aussie bounced back to around 66.00 yen , after hitting six-year lows around 62.65 offshore as the Japanese currency continued to benefit from safe-haven flows.    * On Wall Street, the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 had been down over 4 percent at one stage on mounting fears of a deep and protracted recession, but swung round late in the day to end up over 1 pct as energy stocks climbed.    * The turn in equities sparked some profit-taking in bonds, though more grim U.S. economic news should keep fixed-income debt supported in the long run.    * Global recession worries have not gone away and there are growing concerns about emerging markets which will keep investors risk-averse for some time to come.    * Brazil intervened heavily to support its currency [nN23468162], while the IMF was considering funding packages for several countries.    * Commodities had a mixed session, with copper hitting three-year lows but oil rising $1.47 to $69.31 on talk of an OPEC production cut.    * No domestic economic data due on Friday, leaving the Aussie and bonds tracking the fortunes of Asian stock markets again.    * Three-year bond futures eased 0.030 points to 95.575, while the 10-year futures contract edged up 0.005 points to 94.905 as the yield curve flattened slightly.    * Bill futures also eased but continue to price in around 100 basis points of easing by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) by year-end.
