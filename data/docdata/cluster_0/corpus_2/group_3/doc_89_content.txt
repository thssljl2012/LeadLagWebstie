Trouble With Oil Down the Road  Dave Cohen    dave.aspo@gmail.com   October 22, 2008    For the Gods perceive things in the future, ordinary people things in the present, but the wise perceive things about to happen.  Philostratus, Life of Apollonius of Tyana, VIII, 7    What a difference a month makes! In Bottoming Out (321Energy, September 10, 2008) I predicted that oil prices would settle in the $75-$80 range (NYMEX WTI monthly average) by 2010 or in 2009 if the economy continued to decline. Today&amp;#039;s bargain price for a barrel of oil is about $73. I still believe the longer term 2009 price will fall into line with my original prediction when OPEC makes deep production cuts and the current credit crunch begins to ease.    A recession in the United States is in full swing even as we wait for lagging government indicators to catch up with the Conference Board and reality. Our oil consumption is a proxy signaling levels of economic activity. The IEA&amp;#039;s September Oil Market Report (OMR) states that &amp;quot;the correlation between economic activity and oil demand is very strong. Between 1983 and 2007, US GDP grew by 3.2% per year on average, while demand expanded by 1.1% per year on average over the same period&amp;quot; (graph below).    U.S. oil demand is way down. Last week&amp;#039;s EIA status report shows that &amp;quot;product supplied&amp;quot; (actual consumption) in the United States fell to 18.660 million barrels per day (b/d), the lowest level since July, 1999 (xls data series). This week&amp;#039;s report is even lower at 18.614 million b/d.    Dramatically lower oil consumption is yet another sign of our ailing economy. The plunge in demand does not betoken a response to high oil prices or a sudden miraculous increase in our energy efficiency. The 4-week moving averages show that product supplied fell from 20.292 million b/d in the last week of August to 18.660 in the first week of October, a fall of 8% in a mere 6 weeks. This dip occurred after oil prices, which averaged about $133/barrel (NYMEX WTI monthly) in both June &amp;amp; July, fell to $116.61 in August and then further to $103.90 in September.    No doubt high oil prices have prompted Americans to curtail some of their oil consumption. We would also expect some lag between the high summer prices and falling demand as consumers take the time necessary to make adjustments. Some of the downturn is due to regional spot shortages following the hurricanes. However, the short-run price elasticity of gasoline demand (discussed here) could not possibly be as large as the demand swan dive indicates. The price elasticity of diesel fuel demand is probably even lower. Distillate fuel oil demand was 6.9% below the 2007 level in the latest EIA report, which points to a decrease in trucking volumes. Jet fuel was down 6.4%, signaling a similar fall in air travel.    Sagging U.S. car sales, even where people choose more fuel-efficient vehicles, could not have had much effect in such a short period of time. &amp;quot;The research firm [Global Insight] predicts U.S. new-car sales to total 13.6 million this year, a 16 percent drop from the 16.1 million vehicles sold in 2007.&amp;quot; Finally, rising jobless claims must be affecting vehicle miles traveled because, as CNN Money&amp;#039;s Steve Hargreaves helpfully points out &amp;quot;unemployed people tend to drive a lot less&amp;quot; (Oil Prices: Buckle Up for a Wild Ride (October 8, 2008).    The IEA&amp;#039;s September Oil Market Report states that &amp;quot;The oil price doubled in real terms between 1978 and 1980, leading to a 9.9% oil demand contraction over that period.&amp;quot; Despite the much lower energy intensity (energy consumption per GDP) in the United States now, which is supposed make oil use less sensitive to economic conditions, demand has fallen 8.9% compared to the 2nd week of October, 2007, with most of that coming in the last 7 weeks.    Such is the depth of the economic slowdown in the United States. What about the longer term outlook for the oil markets?    The Medium Term Economic Outlook     I assume the correlation between GDP growth and oil demand (graph above) since 1983 will remain largely the same in the medium-term (2009-2013). Making a significant increase (&amp;amp;gt;10%) in our oil efficiency without our sacrificing economic health is a gradual process that takes a decade or more unless society makes a concerted effort along those lines. Achieving greater efficiency also depends on the pace of new car sales, which depends in turn on the strength of the economic recovery. So we must look at the economic forecasts to assess how much of a comeback OECD oil consumption will make after current recession.    The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has released their World Economic Outlook (October, 2008). The advanced (OECD, without Eastern/Central Europe) economies are forecast to recover quickly after 2009 with real GDP rising to 3% and then falling to 2.5% in 2013 (graph below and Table A1 Summary of World Output, p. 259). The emerging economies, which have clearly demonstrated higher output growth since the mid-1990s, slow down during the recession but recover a bit to achieve a growth rate of 6.9% by 2013.    Many observers don&amp;#039;t believe the IMF&amp;#039;s optimistic forecast. In How to Get Growth Back on Track, Michael Mandel casts doubt on whether the output growth recorded previously in 2004-2007 was real, citing stagnant real wages and salaries, Americans&amp;#039; over-reliance on credit and dubious worker productivity figures.     This view will come as no surprise to those who read Our Phony Economy (ASPO-USA, May 21, 2008) or are familiar with the work of Kevin Phillips. The main product and export of the United States now appears to have been mortgage-backed collateralized debt obligations.     Mandel&amp;#039;s point is that if recent growth was illusory, how are we going to achieve such growth levels after the current downturn? Mandel also cites pessimists (realists?) who would argue with the IMF:    &amp;quot;There will be less innovation [in finance] and less credit expansion, so the speed limit for the growth of the economy will be lower,&amp;quot; says Mohammed El-Erian, co-chief executive at Pimco, the giant bond-fund manager.&amp;quot; This will be the regime for several years.&amp;quot; Adds Rajeev Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University: &amp;quot;This credit problem, whenever it&amp;#039;s solved, will have its fallout on the future growth rate of the economy. It is going to cost resources that could have been used for other things.&amp;quot; [like energy infrastructure...]  China remains the key to all future oil consumption scenarios. The IMF expects China to keep growing, and so do the Chinese (The Guardian, October 10, 2008).    China&amp;#039;s economy will grow 10.1 percent in 2008 and 9.5 percent in 2009 despite the crisis engulfing global markets, the government&amp;#039;s top think-tank [the IMF] said in a report released on Friday [cited above, see Table A4, p. 265]     The forecasts by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) are more optimistic than those of the IMF, which said this week it expects 9.7 percent growth in Chinese gross domestic product this year and 9.3 percent in 2009. &amp;quot;The financial crisis and the world economic slowdown will have an impact on us, but they won&amp;#039;t change the fundamentals of the Chinese economy,&amp;quot; Chen Jiagui, vice-head of CASS, told a conference.   China&amp;#039;s GDP expanded 10.1 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, down from 11.9 percent in all of 2007. &amp;quot;The slowdown in 2008 and 2009 should be read as a normal fluctuation in growth. There is not enough evidence to say that an economic downturn is taking place,&amp;quot; the think-tank said in the report. Domestic investment and consumption would keep the world&amp;#039;s fourth-largest economy on track, the report said.    [China&amp;#039;s 3rd quarter GDP growth slowed to 9%.]    Even now during the worst part of the economic downturn, China&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;crude-oil imports totaled 15.03 million metric tons (3.54 million b/d) in September, about 10% above the 13.66 million tons a year earlier&amp;quot; (or 4.89 million b/d, depending on the source). Here&amp;#039;s a projection for future Chinese oil demand, assuming their domestic production plateau (about 4 million b/d) continues:    I believe anemic growth in the OECD countries along with the continued strong growth forecast by the IMF in the emerging nations is the most likely scenario in 2009-2013. As I discussed in Bottoming Out, non-OECD oil demand will slow a bit during the current downturn but should remain robust in 2009 and thereafter. American oil demand is falling more precipitously than I had imagined possible even a month ago, so demand growth in the developing world (the BRIC countries, the Persian Gulf) will not completely offset falling consumption in the OECD in the next year or so. American oil consumption is also likely to rebound some from its current level in the coming months.    Looking at what we have so far, the following scenario looks reasonable:     The correlation between GDP growth and oil demand (IEA graph above) since1983 will remain largely the same in the medium-term (2009-2013)   China and other developing economies will be consuming more oil in the coming years as their economic growth slows but remains strong   OECD oil average annual consumption will bottom out somewhere well below 2006 consumption levels in 2009   Economic recovery in the advanced economies will be slow, characterized by low growth rates in the medium-term   The rebound in OECD oil consumption will thus lag well behind burgeoning consumption in the emerging economies   Taken together, none of this is particularly alarming as long as the word&amp;#039;s oil supply can continue to grow. But if we add the following condition    The global crude oil supply will hit a permanent ceiling in 2011, as argued in Peak Oi...
