  It was a good week for bargain hunters on the street            Dow Ends Rocky Week in Black       By PETER A. MCKAY        Stocks declined Friday but held on to solid gains for the week, as investors wondered how badly the economy is ailing, and when it is going to recover.     The Dow Jones Industrial Average remained volatile Friday, swinging in a 563-point range including big gains and losses. A late-day swoon left the blue-chip measure down 127.04 points at the closing bell, off 1.4%, at 8852.22.   Caterpillar   was the Dow&amp;#039;s weakest component on Friday, off 7.2% following a round of downbeat housing data. The average&amp;#039;s financial names all finished lower as well, hurt by lingering worries about the credit crunch.   Citigroup   was the weakest of that group, off 6.4%.      But for the week, the Dow rose 4.8%, its first such gain since the meltdown of Lehman Brothers Holdings set off a global financial crisis in mid-September. The gain was also the Dow&amp;#039;s biggest weekly rise in percentage terms since March 2003.    Markets on the Move     Although the global economy&amp;#039;s weakness remains deep-seated for now, the timing of a potential turnaround also remains a hot topic of debate on Wall Street, with  some investors placing early bets on a rebound both in the U.S. and overseas .         &amp;amp;quot;Based on what we&amp;#039;re seeing, the second half of this year is shaping up to be really, really bad,&amp;amp;quot; said Deutsche Bank economist Joe LaVorgna. &amp;amp;quot;But it could also be so bad that it wipes out any remaining imbalances. What you&amp;#039;ll be left with is a lot of pent-up demand.&amp;amp;quot;     Pump prices have generally been on the decline lately, but other pressures remain for consumers whose buying activity represents more than two-thirds of the overall U.S. economy. Employment has fallen for nine straight months, the struggles of major financial institutions have made it more difficult to get credit, and lower home prices have cut into the wealth of many families.     On Friday, the Commerce Department reported that construction of new dwellings dropped 6.3% last month to the slowest pace since January 1991, when the U.S. was in the midst of an eight-month recession and going through another painful housing correction.     However, that recession was brief by historical standards, unlike the scenario worrying some investors and analysts who say the current slump could last several years. Mr. LaVorgna said he believes those fears are overblown, with a recovery possible perhaps in the second quarter of 2009.      Similar sentiments were evident in a column in Friday&amp;#039;s New York Times by renowned investor Warren Buffett, who recommended buying U.S. stocks. The billionaire said that his entire personal fortune may soon be invested in the domestic market in anticipation of an economic recovery.       &amp;amp;quot;If you wait for the robins, spring will be over,&amp;amp;quot; wrote Mr. Buffett. &amp;amp;quot;Bad news is an investor&amp;#039;s best friend. It lets you buy a slice of America&amp;#039;s future at a marked-down price.&amp;amp;quot;      Other stock measures slipped Friday but finished with weekly gains. The S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 fell 0.6% to 940.55, up 4.6% on the week. The broad measure was hurt Friday by a 2.9% drop in its   financial sector  , although gains in   basic materials   and   energy  , up 2.7% and 2.2% respectively, kept the S&amp;amp;amp;P&amp;#039;s daily decline in check.     The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite Index was down 0.4% for the day, ending at 1711.29, up 3.7% on the week. The small-stock Russell 2000 tumbled 1.9% to 526.43, up 0.8% on the week.     More instability is expected in the market in the weeks ahead. The Chicago Board Options Exchange&amp;#039;s Volatility Index, which uses options prices to measure investors&amp;#039; nervousness about upcoming stock-market swings, was up about 4%, ending at 70.33.     Options contracts on individual stocks and major indexes expired on Friday, which added wider-than-normal swings in the market. Traders must buy or sell shares to offset their expiring options bets.     The credit markets showed further signs of easing, although traders and analysts warned that conditions could remain stop-and-go awhile longer. The British Bankers Association quoted Libor -- a key interbank lending rate -- at 4.41875% for three-month loans of U.S. dollars, down from Thursday&amp;#039;s fixing of 4.5025%. The one-month rate fell to 4.18125% from 4.2775%.     But those rates are still well above the levels seen before the failure of Lehman Brothers and before the Federal Reserve and its overseas colleagues carried out their coordinated rate cuts.     Barclays Capital analyst Mike Pond said Libor rates may not drop to pre-Lehman levels within the next 12 months. &amp;amp;quot;The market is pricing in too optimistic a scenario,&amp;amp;quot; at the moment he said. Supporting that view is the big gap between Libor and the comparable Treasury rate -- the so-called Ted spread -- which remains close to its record peak, around 330 basis points.     Traders on Friday reported modestly stronger demand for commercial paper, which is used by companies to fund a variety of short-term needs, including payroll and other activities. In particular, buyers seemed hungry for asset-backed paper.     Treasury prices were mixed. The yield on three-month bills, which have seen heavy buying lately from investors looking for safe havens, climbed to around 0.8%, up from about 0.4% late Thursday. The price of the benchmark 10-year ntoe rose 2/32, pushing the yield to 3.961%. The 30-year bond fell 1-15/32 to yield 4.314%.     Financial shares lagged the broader stock market due to the lingering worries about credit.   The S&amp;amp;amp;P&amp;#039;s financial sector   was off 2.9%. The KBW Regional Bank Index was off 2.8%.     The federal government announced Tuesday that it planned to buy $250 billion of preferred stock in U.S. banks. Nine major U.S. banks will accept $125 billion, and the rest will be available to small- and medium-sized institutions that apply for government funding.     Analysts said that disclosure of the details of the government&amp;#039;s plan has boosted investors&amp;#039; confidence to a degree. Still, the moves don&amp;#039;t necessarily close the chapter on bank failures and mergers.     &amp;amp;quot; The government, by anointing these nine banks, [is setting them] up as survivors, and they will probably buy the assets of others ,&amp;amp;quot; said Kim Caughey, senior investment analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.  &amp;amp;quot;This is kind of a Darwinian event, and there are going to be winners and losers.&amp;amp;quot;      Crude oil, which on Thursday finished below $70 a barrel for the first time in more than a year, staged a modest recovery as traders bet that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will cut production when its ministers hold an emergency meeting next week. Crude futures were up $2, or 2.9%, to $71.85 a barrel at $71.72 a barrel, down 7.5% for the week in New York trading.      Crude has plummeted 51% from the all-time high it set in July.      The months-long oil collapse has largely been triggered by the demise of investment banks, said Fadel Gheit, a senior oil analyst with Oppenheimer &amp;amp;amp; Co. Banks have drastically curtailed their highly-leveraged businesses, such as commodities trading, due to &amp;amp;quot;the tightening credit, the diminishing appetite for risk and tougher government regulation,&amp;amp;quot; he said.     Reduced speculative activity could keep oil prices closer in line with supply and demand for months to come. When the global economy stabilizes, &amp;amp;quot;there&amp;#039;ll be a base for oil prices, but definitely lower than the current level,&amp;amp;quot; Mr. Gheit said.     The broad Dow Jones-AIG Commodity Index was up 1.9%.  Gold futures fell $16.40, or 2.1%, to $785.10 per ounce in New York.      The dollar strengthened major rivals. Against the Japanese currency, the dollar rose to 101.65 yen, down from 101.41 yen late Thursday. The price of the euro fell to $1.3407, down from $1.3469.       Google   rose 5.5%   after reporting a 26% profit rise   for the third quarter, topping analyst estimates after it cut expenses.   Advanced Micro Devices   rose 2.2% after it said Thursday that its net loss narrowed as the   chip maker improved sales and margins and recorded smaller charges  .
