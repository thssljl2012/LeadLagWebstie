 UPL Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 5              NG Gains as Lower Gulf Output Expected to Cut Storage    Natural Gas Gains as Lower Gulf Output Expected to Cut Storage        By Reg Curren         Oct. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Natural gas futures gained on  speculation lingering production shutdowns in the Gulf of Mexico  caused by two hurricanes will keep stockpiles from rising near  the record levels expected in early September.         Analysts including  George Hopley  of Barclays Capital and   Martin King  of FirstEnergy Capital Corp. had predicted stockpiles  would top 3.5 trillion cubic feet by the end of this month. Most  analysts have pared that to about 3.4 trillion.         ``Gas is offline, there&amp;#039;s less LNG imports and winter is  coming, so I&amp;#039;ll not be surprised to see gas stay strong,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said   Peter Linder , an analyst and senior adviser at DeltaOne Energy  Fund in Calgary.         Natural gas for November delivery gained 14 cents, or 1.9  percent, to $7.578 per million British thermal units at 10:26  a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices advanced 3  percent yesterday.         About 46 percent of the Gulf&amp;#039;s daily output of 7.4 billion  cubic feet was still offline as of yesterday, according to the  U.S. Minerals Management Service. Gulf offshore production  accounts for about one-seventh of U.S. output.         Cumulative production losses from the storms are likely to  exceed 240 billion cubic feet by the time all operations are  restored, Hopley said in a report yesterday. Reduced demand after  Ike and Gustav will result in a net deficit of 120 billion cubic  feet, he said.         Year-Ago Supplies         Stockpiles being rebuilt to meet needs during the winter,  when demand peaks, increased in the week ended Sept. 19 to 3.023  trillion cubic feet. Inventories were 162 billion cubic feet, or  5.1 percent, below year-earlier amounts, and 35 billion above the  five-year average for the period, the Energy Department said  Sept. 25.         ``Here we are going into October and the next few weeks  aren&amp;#039;t typically big injections,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said  Chris Jarvis , president  of Caprock Risk Management LLC in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire.  ``Natural gas may only get to 3.3 trillion for winter.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;         Supplies have, on average, started the winter at 3.327  trillion cubic feet.         Stockpiles will be near that amount, though it provides less  comfort than in the past because of a ``sea change in demand with  the influx of people using gas as crude products went through the  roof,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Jarvis said.         On an energy equivalency basis, oil used to heat buildings  and run power plants traded at a premium to gas in New York of  about 50 percent, based on spot prices yesterday.         Gas in storage probably rose 77 billion cubic feet in the  week ended Sept. 26, according to the median of 13 analyst  estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The average change for the  period is a gain of 72 billion.         The Energy Department is scheduled to release the next  weekly storage report tomorrow.
