U.S. stock indexes mostly lower with tech a bright spot   Thursday October 9, 10:52 am ET   By Kate Gibson         NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Stocks turned lower on Thursday after  early gains as financial shares weighed, dimming enthusiasm that  came as International Business Machines Corp. topped profit  estimates.   ADVERTISEMENT         After adding about 150 points early on, the Dow Jones Industrial  Average (DJI:^DJI - News) was more recently down 41.81 points at  9,216.29, with 18 of its 30 components trading lower.      General Motors Corp. (NYSE:GM - News) proved the heaviest weight on  the Dow industrials, with the automaker&amp;#039;s stock falling 16.1%.      Up about 7% at the start, Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC - News)  erased its gains to trade lower, recently down 1.5%.      The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its peak exactly one year ago,  and has since lost nearly 35% of its value.      The S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 fell 5.32 points to 979.62, with the financial  sector fronting sector losses among the S&amp;amp;amp;P&amp;#039;s 10 industry  groups.      Noteworthy laggards among financial shares included XL Capital Ltd.  (NYSE:XL - News) , its shares down 38.5%, while student lender SLM  Corp. (NYSE:SLM - News) fell 38.1%.      The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (COMP - News) rose 10.43  points to 1,750.76.73, bolstered by industry bellwether IBM  (NYSE:IBM - News) releasing its third-quarter earnings ahead of  schedule, reporting a 20% profit rise and reiterating its 2008  outlook.      &amp;quot;The news could provide some solace, following the stock&amp;#039;s recent  pain. Even so, we think the enormous level of investor fear over  the lingering effects of the financial services morass on IT  spending could keep IBM and other IT hardware stocks under pressure  in the near term,&amp;quot; said J.P. Morgan analysts. See full report .      Shares of IBM gained nearly 1%.      Volume on the New York Stock Exchange neared 376 million, and  declining stocks outran those advancing 4 to 3. On the Nasdaq, 242  million shares traded, with rising stocks edged just past those  declining.      Rate cuts   The stock market&amp;#039;s advance comes one day after the U.S. Federal  Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of England and other central  banks made coordinated rate cuts. The moves seemed to make little  impact on Wednesday with the Dow industrials dropping 189 points,  the Nasdaq Composite falling 14 points and the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 shedding  11 points.      &amp;quot;Despite the poor close, I do think we are finally at the point  where the short-term downside risk is minimal. While the upside  might take time to develop, recession, earnings, and a credit  crisis are discounted,&amp;quot; said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at  Miller Tabak.      According to a report, the Treasury Department is considering a  plan to take ownership stakes in many U.S. banks, both healthy and  troubled, The New York Times reported, citing unnamed government  officials. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in a speech  Wednesday that he has the authority to do so under the $700 billion  bailout plan. Read more.      Britain on Wednesday announced a similar plan, though no U.K. bank  as yet has taken government cash.      &amp;quot;If Paulson heeds the advice of (U.K. Prime Minister Gordon) Brown  and (Chancellor Alistair) Darling, the chances that the U.S.  economy will be steered away from a deep recession extending  through 2009 will be greatly improved,&amp;quot; said economists at RDQ  Economics.      In a related note, the Fed late Wednesday said it&amp;#039;s going to lend  $37.8 billion in additional cash to American International Group  Inc. (NYSE:AIG - News) for domestic life insurance subsidiaries in  return for investment grade fixed-income securities. See The  Fed.

The world&amp;#039;s top steelmaker, ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT - News) ,  reiterated its third-quarter profit guidance and said second-half  operating profit will grow, lifting shares of the steelmaker 10% in  Paris.

(NYSE:SSI - News) each  issuing profit warnings. Read Retail Stocks .
