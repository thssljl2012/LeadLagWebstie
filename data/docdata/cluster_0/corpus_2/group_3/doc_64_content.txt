SYDNEY, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Australia&amp;#039;s central bank has allocated the highest weight to China&amp;#039;s currency in its new trade-weighted basket of currencies, toppling the Japanese yen and reflecting increased trade ties with the Asian giant.    The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said the weighting of the Chinese renminbi would rise 1 percentage point to form 16.3672 percent of the trade-weighted index in 2008/09.    The index provides a gauge of the Australian dollar&amp;#039;s performance against the currencies of its main trading partners.    Since 2000/01, the weight of the renminbi in the basket has risen by 10 percentage points.    The Japanese yen, which has had the highest weighting in the index since 1983-84, was broadly unchanged from 2007/08 at 15.4040 percent.    The weight of the euro fell by half a percentage point while the U.S. dollar dropped by 0.75 percent, the RBA said.    The combined weight of the Asian-Pacific currencies, excluding Japan, increased to 52 percent while the combined weights of the North American and European currencies fell to 11.0 percent and 18.1 percent, the RBA said in a statement.    &amp;#039;These declines reflect a large increase in the value of two-way trade with the Asia-Pacific region, in particular with China, rather than a decline in the value of two-way trade with Europe and North America.&amp;#039;    Last year, China passed Japan as Australia&amp;#039;s largest trading partner with two-way flows topping A$50 billion ($48.74 billion).    Iron ore exports to China alone have expanded by an average annual rate of 25 percent in the past five years, with the Asian economic powerhouse now swallowing up half of Australia&amp;#039;s output.
