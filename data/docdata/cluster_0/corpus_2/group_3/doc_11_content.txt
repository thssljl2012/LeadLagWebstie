Wall Street is wobbling after Congress rejected the proposed $700 billion bailout plan, leaving traders in New York and around the world gasping in amazement and disbelief.    Now Jonathan Spall, a director in BarCap&amp;#039;s commodities division, has explained that even if an alternative arrangement is struck up, investors will be pushed into a reconsideration of gold&amp;#039;s merits.    Speaking in Japan at the London Bullion Market Association&amp;#039;s (LBMA) annual conference, he said: &amp;quot;I think we should make new highswithin the next six months, I would&amp;#039;ve thought. We should be in a perfect storm for gold.    &amp;quot;I was always very sceptical of the argument of gold as a safe haven, but that has changed dramatically for me and for others - now it&amp;#039;s financial institutions themselves that are under threat.&amp;quot;    Many of the delegates at the conference in Kyoto predicted that gold prices would remain between $700 and $1,200 per ounce in 2009, thus possibly beating the high of $1,033 per ounce recorded in March.    As Jeremy Charles, chairman of the LBMA and head of precious metals at HSBC in London, lucidly summed up: &amp;quot;High bullion prices are here to stay.&amp;quot;
