For the year to August, total dwelling unit approvals slumped 8.6 percent [nSYU005199].    * Australian private credit rose 0.5 percent in August, matching a Reuters poll.    NEWS: The RBA added A$1.95 billion ($1.6 billion) in repurchase agreements, slightly above the estimated daily need of A$1.87 billion.    ___________________________________  ____________________________    * The Australian dollar was weak below 80 U.S. cents and held near two-week lows against the yen as regional stock markets fell sharply in a flight to safety after U.S. lawmakers rejected a $700 billion bailout package.    * Investors rushed to unwind risky leveraged carry trade positions. The Aussie fell to a two-week low against the yen , dropping to as low as 82.12 yen from 87.70 yen late here on Monday.    * Adding to the Aussie&amp;#039;s woes was a tumble in commodities prices. The CRB commodity index suffered its biggest one-day loss, closing down 5.9 percent.    * Also weighing on the Aussie was the possibility of a sharp interest rate cut by the central bank to cushion the economy. Investors are pricing in an 60 percent chance of a 50 basis point rate cut when the RBA meets next month, to ease some of the tight monetary conditions.    * The Aussie got a brief fillip from the better-than-expected retail sales data.    * Shortly after midday, the Aussie was at $0.7994, up from a session low of $0.7935 but below the $0.8250 late here on Monday.    * The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) injected cash again on Tuesday, just a day after the Federal Reserve announced a $330 billion expansion in its liquidity injection arrangement with other major central banks across the world, to help ease the credit squeeze in interbank money markets.    * Australian bond futures surged as investors scrambled for safe-haven investments. Government bonds and gold were preferred amid continued bank failures and an unwillingness of financial institutions to lend to each other.    * Three-year Australian bond futures jumped 0.250 points to 94.945, while the 10-year bond contract added 0.225 points to 94.58.
