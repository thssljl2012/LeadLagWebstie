SYDNEY, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar held near four-year lows against the U.S. dollar and a five-year trough on the yen on Tuesday ahead of an expected rate cut by the central bank as it seeks to cushion the economy from the credit crisis.    * A sharp slide in commodities added to the Aussie&amp;#039;s woes, with the LME base metals index down over 5 percent and oil off 6 percent. Australia is a big exporter of natural resources.    * Investors expect the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to cut interest rates by an aggressive 50 basis points to 6.5 percent at its monthly policy meeting later on Tuesday.    * The decision will be announced at 2:30 p.m. (0330 GMT) and will follow a 25 basis point cut last month.    * Panic selling offshore, sparked by fears the global economy was heading toward recession, saw the Aussie suffer its biggest one-day fall since 1985, losing over seven U.S. cents and 10 yen at one stage, compared to Friday&amp;#039;s finish.    * By 9:40 a.m. (2240 GMT), the Aussie was at $0.7175 against the U.S. dollar, off a four-year trough of $0.6970 struck offshore but much weaker than Monday&amp;#039;s $0.7491.    * Against the yen, the Aussie tumbled to 70.27 yen in offshore trade, before recovering some ground to 72.81 yen as a meltdown in global stock markets saw investors exit leveraged carry trades.    * The drop in global stock markets came amid the emergency rescue of two big European banks and a move by several European governments to guarantee bank deposits.    * The latest slump brought the Aussie&amp;#039;s losses in the last three months to more than 25 U.S. cents and 32 yen as the deepening credit crisis sent investors fleeing to the safety of the Japanese currency and government debt.    * Australian bond futures extended their rally, buoyed by safe-haven inflows and strong expectations that the RBA will cut the cash rate aggressively and possibly leave the door open for more in the coming months.    * Three-year Australian bond futures rose 0.065 points to 95.285, while the 10-year bond contract added 0.035 points to 94.915.
