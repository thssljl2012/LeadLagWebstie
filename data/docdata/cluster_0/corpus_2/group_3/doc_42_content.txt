Oil falls below $62 as investors eye weak demand   Monday October 27, 7:50 am ET   By George Jahn, Associated Press Writer   Oil falls below $62 a barrel as investors eye falling demand         VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Growing evidence of a severe global  economic slowdown drove oil prices to below $62 a barrel Monday, as  investors brushed off a sizable OPEC output cut.   Traders were taking their cues from world markets, which slumped  again Monday with the Nikkei index in Japan closing at its lowest  in 26 years, down 6.4 percent. Hong Kong, and European markets  followed suit, closing or trading substantially lower. The Dow  Jones industrial average fell 3.6 percent Friday.      ADVERTISEMENT         Light, sweet crude for December delivery declined $2.23 to $61.92 a  barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange by  noon in Europe, the lowest since May 2007.      On Friday -- even after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting  Countries announced a 1.5 million barrel-a-day cut -- oil fell  $3.69 to settle at $64.15. Prices have plunged 57 percent from a  record $147.27 on July 11.      &amp;quot;The mood is fairly negative reflecting worry about the  international economic outlook,&amp;quot; said David Moore, a commodity  strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. &amp;quot;If there  is further weak economic data in the U.S. or Europe, prices could  come under more downward pressure.&amp;quot;      Iran&amp;#039;s OPEC governor Mohammad Ali Khatibi said Sunday a reduction  in production &amp;quot;will be considered&amp;quot; at the group&amp;#039;s next meeting in  Algiers in December -- a meeting that might even be held early if  necessary.      &amp;quot;I thought the OPEC cut was a fairly decisive act, but concerns of  recession in the major economies remain dominant,&amp;quot; Moore said.  &amp;quot;OPEC&amp;#039;s cut does take a step toward tightening the market.&amp;quot;      Vienna&amp;#039;s JBC Energy said prices were out of OPEC&amp;#039;s control -- for  now.      &amp;quot;Oil is currently being driven by the present financial crisis and  not by OPEC cuts,&amp;quot; said its research report. &amp;quot;As oil prices are  being pressured by the credit squeeze and a lack of liquidity, they  may stay largely detached from supply factors for several weeks to  come. As a result, OPEC is currently struggling with factors beyond  its control.&amp;quot;      Investors have been paying close attention to signs that a slowing  economy and higher gasoline prices earlier this year have hurt  crude demand in the U.S., the world&amp;#039;s largest oil consumer.      The U.S. Department of Transportation said Friday that Americans  drove 5.6 percent less, or 15 billion fewer miles (24 billion fewer  kilometers), in August compared with same month a year ago -- the  biggest single monthly decline since the data was first collected  regularly in 1942.      &amp;quot;If we&amp;#039;re looking a severe economic downturn, it&amp;#039;s hard to say what  the bottom of any commodity price will be,&amp;quot; Moore said.      In other Nymex trading, gasoline futures fell more than 3 cents to  $1.44 a gallon, while heating oil slipped by more than 4 cents to  $1.91 a gallon. Natural gas for November delivery fell nearly 21  cents to $6.03 per 1,000 cubic feet.      In London, November Brent crude was down $1.75 to $60.30 a barrel  on the ICE Futures exchange.
