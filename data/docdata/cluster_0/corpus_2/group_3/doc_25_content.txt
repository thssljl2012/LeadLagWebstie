Oil rises to $101 on bailout plan hopes   Wednesday October 1, 6:54 am ET   By Pablo Gorondi, Associated Press Writer         Oil rises to $101 on hopes US bailout plan will pass         Oil prices were up slightly to $101 a barrel Wednesday on  expectations that U.S. lawmakers will pass a revised bank bailout  plan that they rejected earlier this week.   By midday in Europe, light, sweet crude for November delivery was  up 36 cents to $101 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York  Mercantile Exchange. Overnight, oil rose $4.27 to settle at  $100.64.      Wednesday&amp;#039;s session continued to show the price swings and frequent  reversals in direction seen in previous days. The Nymex contract  was trading between a high of $102.84 and a low of $100.57.      &amp;quot;In a low volume environment, the intraday volatility (of the Nymex  contract) remains extremely high,&amp;quot; said Olivier Jakob of  Petromatrix in Switzerland.      In London, November Brent crude rose 10 cents to $98.27 a barrel on  the ICE Futures exchange.      U.S. Senate leaders scheduled a vote for Wednesday on a version of  the emergency bill that adds substantial tax cuts meant to appeal  to Republicans when it reaches the House of Representatives. The  House rejected a similar $700 billion plan Monday by a vote of  228-205.      But traders were skeptical a bailout of bad mortgage debt would  quickly reverse slowing global economic growth and weakening demand  for crude.      &amp;quot;It would be good news to avoid further turmoil, but it&amp;#039;s too early  to assume a new package would lead to a recovery in the U.S.,&amp;quot; said  Tetsu Emori, commodity markets fund manager at ASTMAZ Futures Co.  in Tokyo.      A slump in energy demand has accelerated in Asia. In India,  domestic oil product sales totaled 2.41 million barrels per day in  August, the lowest level this year, according to Barclays Capital  research. In the same month, Japan&amp;#039;s oil demand fell by 8.4  percent.      Investors also have an eye on the weekly oil inventories report to  be released later Wednesday from the U.S. Energy Department&amp;#039;s  Energy Information Administration.      The petroleum supply report was expected to show that oil stocks  rose as much as 1.5 million or fell as much as 1.5 million barrels,  according to the average of analysts&amp;#039; estimates in a survey by  energy information provider Platts.      The Platts survey also showed that analysts projected gasoline  inventories fell between 1 million and 3 million barrels and  distillates went down between 1 million and 2 million barrels last  week.      &amp;quot;I&amp;#039;m pessimistic,&amp;quot; Emori said. &amp;quot;I think the U.S. is already in a  recession.&amp;quot;      In other Nymex trading, heating oil futures rose 1.25 cents $2.9072  a gallon, while gasoline prices gained 0.27 cent to $2.4604 a  gallon. Natural gas for November delivery rose 9.6 cents to $7.534  per 1,000 cubic feet.      Associated Press writer Alex Kennedy in Singapore contributed to  this report.
