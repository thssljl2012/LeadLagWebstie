       Enjoy!  PREVIEW-Investors look past quarter to oil services outlook Wed Oct 15, 2008 1:27pm EDT  * Schlumberger better placed, its outlook closely watched * Credit big question mark for energy production companies * Oil prices down sharply since end of third quarter By Braden Reddall SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Strength in the latest quarterly profit figures from oil services companies will only mask a growing unease about what a sharp drop in energy prices and choked credit markets mean for their business overall. It is only two weeks since the end of the quarter, when U.S. crude oil CLc1 was $100 a barrel, and the outlook has changed dramatically. Crude now fetches about $75 a barrel, pummeled by worries about demand in a sharp global economic slowdown. The double whammy of lower prices and dried-up credit has hit heavily indebted energy producers hardest, but their response of slashed spending plans points to a knock-on effect on the oil services industry. [ID:nN07389873] Earnings on Friday from Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) will be watched closely for its view of the industry. Joe Agular, oil services analyst at Johnson Rice, said the sector leader itself now looks better placed because of its relatively lower exposure to the struggling North American natural gas market. Oil services companies generally had big order backlogs and good balance sheets, he noted. The greater concern in energy was for their clients exposed to the credit crunch. &amp;amp;quot;That&amp;#039;s the one area that&amp;#039;s sort of questionable,&amp;amp;quot; Agular said. After the recent market sell-off, investors will also search for signs the exploration cycle is winding down and may focus more intently on the outlook for oil and gas companies. &amp;amp;quot;Investors are on a hair trigger about downside risk,&amp;amp;quot; said Dan Pickering, co-president at Houston energy investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt &amp;amp;amp; Co Securities. The September industry count from Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) showed 1,108 rigs operating internationally and 2,449 in North America, both up on August and a year ago, but spending by North American energy producers is set to fall sharply. Barclays Capital, although bullish on the sector due to low share valuations, expects 2009 North American exploration and production spending to drop 15 percent due to lower oil and gas prices, while international spending will rise 20 percent. &amp;amp;quot;We expect conditions to deteriorate as the rig count falls,&amp;amp;quot; Barclays said in a note on Tuesday. &amp;amp;quot;Pricing gains which have recently occurred will most likely reverse and margins will be under pressure.&amp;amp;quot; So despite the hurricanes that disrupted Gulf of Mexico production, oilfield services companies may eventually look back fondly on the latest third quarter. Schlumberger is forecast to report another good quarter, with the average earnings estimate 15 percent above a year before, according to Reuters Estimates. (See table below) Rival Halliburton Co (HAL.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) is expected to show 13 percent profit growth on Monday, followed on Wednesday by Baker Hughes, with 11 percent growth seen, and National Oilwell Varco Inc (NOV.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) a day later, with a 50 percent profit leap forecast. &amp;amp;quot;I don&amp;#039;t think third-quarter earnings will be the focus,&amp;amp;quot; Pickering said. &amp;amp;quot;Right now the focus is going to be on capital discipline and balance sheet discipline.&amp;amp;quot; Investors will comb the results of companies that have booked long-term work such as offshore drilling contractor Transocean Inc (RIG.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) and National Oilwell Varco, which manufactures drilling rigs, he said. Agular noted a benefit of broadly depressed global commodity prices was that steel prices would also be coming down, lowering input costs for oil services providers. Tenaris (TENR.MI: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz)(TENA.BA: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz)(TS.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), the world&amp;#039;s top producer of seamless steel pipes for the energy industry, warned last month of a downturn in its third-quarter results, blaming the summer closure of European plants and Gulf of Mexico hurricanes, but said the medium-term outlook was favorable. Tenaris is hoping for a boost from national oil companies in resource-rich developing countries, which need sophisticated equipment and services as they build up exploration expertise to become independent from international oil majors. European oil services companies Technip SA (TECF.PA: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) and Saipem SpA (SPMI.MI: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) had a good third quarter, but look exposed to project cancellations because of their focus on construction. Schlumberger&amp;#039;s geographical reach will help it weather the North American slump. Its shares are down 38 percent in 2008 versus a 49 percent drop in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange oil services index  and a 54 percent drop for Baker Hughes.
