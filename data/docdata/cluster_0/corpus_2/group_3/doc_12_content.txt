Oil falls below $65 on US contraction   Friday October 31, 12:52 am ET   By Stephen Wright, AP Business Writer          Oil falls below $65 in Asia on US economic contraction, fears of  demand slump       BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Oil prices slipped below $65 a barrel in  Asia Friday, extending declines after data showed the U.S. economy  contracted in the latest quarter, reinforcing expectations of a  prolonged slump in demand.      Light, sweet crude for December delivery was down $1.44 to $64.52 a  barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange by  midmorning in Singapore. The contract overnight fell $1.54 to  settle at $65.96. Oil prices have fallen about 55 percent since  peaking above $147 a barrel in mid-July.      U.S. gross domestic product, the broadest barometer of a nation&amp;#039;s  economic health, shrank at a 0.3 percent annual rate in the  July-September quarter, the Commerce Department said overnight. It  marked the worst showing for the world&amp;#039;s largest economy since it  contracted at a 1.4 percent pace in the third quarter of 2001.      The negative cue provided by the U.S. data continued into Asian  trade, compounding the pressure from a generally strong dollar,  said David Moore, commodity strategist with Commonwealth Bank of  Australia in Sydney.      Investors often buy commodities such as crude oil as an inflation  hedge when the dollar weakens and sell those investments when the  greenback rises. Oil investors have also been tracking equity  indexes as a barometer of global economic health.      The euro eased to $1.2833 from $1.3181 in late Asian trade  Thursday. The region&amp;#039;s stock markets were mixed after a blistering  rally the previous day with Hong Kong&amp;#039;s Hang Seng index down 1.8  percent and South Korea&amp;#039;s benchmark index up 1.5 percent.      &amp;quot;The dollar has been relatively firm and that has taken some of the  edge off the market. There&amp;#039;s also the other issues that have been  in the market for a while such as worries about demand and  consumption patterns,&amp;quot; Moore said.      &amp;quot;A further fall in the oil price cannot be ruled out. It is  difficult to predict where the bottom could be,&amp;quot; he added. &amp;quot;An  important factor over the next few months will be whether OPEC can  achieve its output cuts. If it can that will certainly tighten  market conditions.&amp;quot;      Last week, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  announced plans to cut 1.5 million barrels of production per day at  an extraordinary meeting in Vienna called to address plummeting  prices.      Venezuela&amp;#039;s Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez says that OPEC, which  controls about 40 percent of world crude oil production, will need  to cut production at least another 1 million barrels per day to  boost falling prices.      In other Nymex trading, heating oil fell 2.96 cents to $1.9545 a  gallon and natural gas for December delivery was down 5.9 cents at  $6.37 per 1,000 cubic feet.      In London, December Brent crude fell $1.41 to $62.30 a barrel on  the ICE Futures exchange.       http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081031/oil_prices.html
