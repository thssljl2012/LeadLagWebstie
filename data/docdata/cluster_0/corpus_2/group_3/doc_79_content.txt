TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan will consider cutting interest rates at a policy meeting this week, a source informed on the matter said on Wednesday.    News of a potential cut in Japanese rates to 0.25 percent pushed up Tokyo stocks and dragged on the yen, overshadowing an unexpectedly large rise in Japanese industrial output. ***********************************  ****************************    KEY POINTS:    -- Source tells Reuters that the Bank of Japan is considering a rate cut at its regular one-day meeting on Friday, but was watching market conditions before making a final decision. [ID:nN28606033]    -- Hopes of a rate cut pushed Japan&amp;#039;s Nikkei share average , which fell to a 26-year low this week and has halved this year, up 7 percent.    -- Industrial output fell 1.2 percent in the third quarter, the third straight quarter of decline.    -- Output rose 1.2 percent in September, above a median market forecast for a 0.5 percent gain.    -- Manufacturers&amp;#039; output, the core component of production, is expected to fall 2.3 percent in October and 2.2 percent in November, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said.    COMMENTARY:    NAOKI MURAKAMI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MONEX INC    &amp;#039;A rate cut could be an option to put a break on the yen&amp;#039;s rise, which puts downward pressure on the Japanese economy.    &amp;#039;Inflation concerns are fading and the FOMC is likely to cut interest rates by 50 basis points to 1 percent as the United States is leaning towards a policy to prevent deflation.    &amp;#039;Can the Bank of Japan alone stand still, saying Japan&amp;#039;s interest rates are already low?    &amp;#039;That said, however, I doubt if the BOJ will cut rates on Friday as media speculate, because it can still do other things such as adding interest on deposits banks hold at the central bank. Even if the BOJ wants to cut interest rates this week, it will take time to form a consensus on its policy board as some members are reluctant about an immediate rate cut.    &amp;#039;But the BOJ is likely to cut interest rates by the end of this year.&amp;#039;    KYOHEI MORITA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL JAPAN    &amp;#039;We don&amp;#039;t see the Bank of Japan lowering rates this week. The central bank now thinks it is important to provide ample liquidity, including in dollars.    &amp;#039;And a Japan rate cut per se would not change the yen&amp;#039;s direction, as the recent unwinding of yen carry trades did not stem from Japan&amp;#039;s interest rate level.&amp;#039;    NAOMI HASEGAWA, SENIOR STRATEGIST, MITSUBISHI UFJ SECURITIES    &amp;#039;I think it is getting difficult for the BOJ to distance itself from the international coordination.    &amp;#039;The BOJ will have to cut interest rates now that markets are expecting it. The bank will have no other choice.&amp;#039;    TATSUSHI SHIKANO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MITSUBISHI UFJ SECURITIES    &amp;#039;As a slowdown in overseas economies is broadening and is speeding up, declines in the nation&amp;#039;s industrial output are also gaining momentum.    &amp;#039;If the current falling pace were to be maintained, Japan&amp;#039;s industrial output could log a fall of over 3 percent in the three months to December from the previous quarter.    &amp;#039;A steeper-than-expected worsening of the Japanese economy, sharper than expected appreciation of the yen and deeper-than-expected declines in share prices are pushing the Bank of Japan to expedite the timing of rate cuts.&amp;#039;    KOICHI HAJI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NLI RESEARCH INSTITUTE    &amp;#039;When you look at Japan&amp;#039;s economic health alone, the Bank of Japan doesn&amp;#039;t need to cut interest rates. I also doubt whether a rate cut would stem yen rises.    &amp;#039;But there is also little reason for the BOJ not to cut rates. Although cutting rates might not have much stimulative effect on the economy, it&amp;#039;s hard for the bank to continue resisting action when financial markets are so unstable.&amp;#039;    &amp;#039;Still, a rate cut would send a message to the world that Japan is cooperating with other nations in tackling the financial crisis.&amp;#039;    &amp;#039;Now that the news is out, markets would be hugely disappointed if the BOJ didn&amp;#039;t cut rates.&amp;#039;    JUNKO NISHIOKA, ECONOMIST, RBS SECURITIES JAPAN    &amp;#039;Although output in September rose, the outlook for October and November suggests output in the final quarter of this year could fall as much as 4 percent from July-September. Declines in output could accelerate ahead.    &amp;#039;The Bank of Japan could seriously consider a rate cut this week. The main reason for this is the sharp rise in the yen. The bank will do what it can do to weaken the yen-rising pressure.&amp;#039;    NORIO MIYAGAWA, ECONOMIST, SHINKO RESEARCH INSTITUTE    &amp;#039;The September output data was not as bad as expected but manufacturers&amp;#039; outlooks for October and November output falls are severe. This indicates they are seeing that not only the economic deterioration in the U.S. but also that of Europe and emerging markets will affect on Japan&amp;#039;s exports.    &amp;#039;Japan&amp;#039;s industrial output is likely to continue to stay in minus figure for at least January-March period although the level of decline may be moderate.    &amp;#039;It is still an open question whether the Bank of Japan will lower interest rates. But considering recent rapid moves in stocks and forex markets and the U.S. economic downturn, it would not be a surprise if the BOJ lowers rates.    TAKUMI TSUNODA, SENIOR ECONOMIST, SHINKIN CENTRAL BANK RESEARCH    &amp;#039;Output has clearly entered an adjustment phase, as exports were clearly slowing down in August and September. As the world economy is expected to slow further in October-December, an adjustment in Japanese output during that period will be quite severe.&amp;#039;    &amp;#039;As the U.S. economy is expected to be stagnant at least until the first quarter of next year, output will remain weak for the time being.&amp;#039;    &amp;#039;I think the BOJ will cut rates. That would have some effect in curbing the yen&amp;#039;s rise.&amp;#039;    MARKET REACTION:    -- For yen updates click, for prices click    -- For JGB updates click, for prices click    -- For stocks click, for the Nikkei share average click     LINK:    -- To view a table of industrial output data, click on    http://www.meti.go.jp/english/statistics/index.html    BACKGROUND:    -- Industrial output has been weak as the global economic slowdown and financial turmoil hit exports and corporate activity, which had offered key support to an economy now on the brink of a recession.    -- A decline in July-September output would mark the third consecutive quarter of falls. That marks the longest such sequence since four consecutive quarters of decline in 2001, when Japan was in recession.    -- For more than half a century, two quarters of declining industrial production have signalled a recession in Japan.    -- Japan measures a recession as a downturn in the economic cycle, which varies from the more widely used definition of two straight quarters of economic contraction.
