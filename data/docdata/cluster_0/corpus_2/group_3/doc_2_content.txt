At 0713 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares fell 4.2 percent to 1,044.16 points. The benchmark index lost 1.4 percent last week and is down more than 30 percent so far this year.  Banks took the most points off the index, with BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) down 4.2 percent, Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) falling 6 percent, Dexia (DEXI.BR: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) slipping 12.8 percent and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) shedding 6.9 percent.  Commerzbank (CBKG.DE: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) tumbled 15.7 percent on big volumes.  &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s a miserable state of affairs. And then you add to that the banking problems we&amp;#039;ve seen over the weekend,&amp;quot; said Henk Potts, strategist at Barclays Stockbrokers. &amp;quot;There&amp;#039;s the bailout plan, which is good news, but there&amp;#039;s uncertainty over the price at which assets are going to be bought. And the reality is that it will take some time to see the benefit.&amp;quot;  Concerns mounted that the rescue package alone might not stave off a U.S. recession.
