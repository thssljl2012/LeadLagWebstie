Gold extends losses on strong $ Jan 06 2009 08:44 "Bull market instruments" which create havoc in volatile markets and risk management have come under the microscope. Another tough year for car sector Jan 09 2009 12:29 2009 is expected to be another tough year for the new car passenger market in SA, with further rationalisation and pricing unavoidable, according to local car manufacturers. Singapore - Gold extended losses early on Tuesday, slipping half a percent following Monday's drop of nearly 2% on dollar weakness and worries about physical demand from India, the world's largest gold consumer. The US dollar edged higher against the euro at $1.3592, holding near Monday's three-week high versus the single currency. "We had a bullish tilt towards gold through December but further strength in the dollar might see gold erode some of those gains," said Toby Hassall, research analyst at Commodity Warrants Australia. He added that the risks appeared weighted towards a stronger dollar and gold prices could slip another 15% or more in the next three months. "US interest rates can't get any lower, but there is room for more expansionary monetary policy in the eurozone, which should strengthen the dollar ... While the dollar firms, we might see gold move towards $800 and then $700 during the first quarter." Gold traded $3.90 lower at $855.00 an ounce by 02:55 GMT, from New York's notional close on Monday, when it dipped to $843.50, its lowest in over a week. But not all analysts were looking for the dollar rally to continue. Dollar key driver for gold "The dollar is the key short-term driver for gold. Over the course of the quarter we expect the dollar to weaken against the euro," said David Moore, Commonwealth Bank's commodities strategist in Sydney. Worries about the ailing international economy in the first half of 2009 would generate some safe haven demand for bullion, but slowing physical demand from India was a concern, he added. "Indian gold imports were very low and that could be significant. An impairment of Indian demand for jewellery could take out some of the floor under gold prices." Gold imports by India, the world's largest buyer of the metal, fell 81% in December, and were down 47% in 2008 as high prices and a slowing economy dented demand. New York gold futures fell $2.3 an ounce to $855.5 in electronic trade, while in Tokyo, December 2009 futures were down 1.1% at 2 566 yuan per gram. Oil prices ticked down 12c to $48.69 a barrel, supported by geopolitical worries in the Middle East and a dispute between Russia and Ukraine over gas pricing. Oil prices have risen from around $35 a barrel since Israel launched its Gaza offensive on December 27, heightening fears of possible disruptions of crude supplies from the Middle East. But the fighting in Gaza did little to support gold. "It would take a far more serious escalation of the violence in the Middle East to drive safe haven buying," a dealer in Singapore said. Platinum dropped 1% or $9.50 to $936.50, but the TOCOM benchmark rose 1.23 percent to 2 800, bringing its gains since the start of the year to 5.6%.
