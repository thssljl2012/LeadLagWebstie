Indexes Burst Higher Again As Leaders Build On Their Recent Gains; Trade Falls BY JONAH KERI Posted 1/2/2009 Stocks surged in lighter volume Friday as the market built on its recent winning ways in the first session of the new year. The Nasdaq jumped 3.5%. The NYSE composite ramped up 2.8%, the Dow industrials 2.9%, the S&amp;P 500 3.2%. The small-cap S&amp;P 600 settled for smaller gains, adding 1.3%. Volume fell 7% on the Nasdaq and 18% on the NYSE compared with Wednesday's levels. For the week, the Nasdaq galloped 6.7%. The NYSE and S&amp;P 500 both advanced 6.8%, the Dow 6.1%. The S&amp;P 600 rose 6.2%. Given the session's big price gains, ideally there would be a simultaneous burst in trading volume. In this case, though, the market dealt with a day sandwiched between a holiday and the weekend. Volume ended so far below average on Friday that it's safe to assume many traders won't return from vacation until Monday. Also, Wednesday's being the last day of the year may have set off some housekeeping trades, with the books closing on 2008. That uptick in volume would thus make for a tougher comparison on Friday. The day's price gains by the broad indexes propelled them well above their 50-day moving averages. That's an encouraging sign, given that that line had offered stern resistance going back several months. The bigger news was the major indexes' building on some impressive gains to close out the year. Most notably, several leaders, mostly small caps, that recently made strong moves tacked on more gains Friday. A small but growing number of stocks are breaking out of bases, then following through on those breakouts with more gains. That's a bullish change for the market. We didn't see many breakouts in the early stages of the rally confirmed by the market's Dec. 2 follow-through day. Now they're coming a little faster, and stronger. The IBD 100, which serves as a proxy for the action of leading stocks, rose a modest 0.7%. AeroVironment (AVAV) climbed 1.45 to 38.26 in nearly double its average volume. The move broke the maker of spy drones above a 37.70 buy point in a base-on-base pattern. The stock went public at 17 a share in January 2007. Profit growth has accelerated over the past two quarters. Thinly traded NCI (NCIT) jumped 1.04 to 31.17, breaking above a 30.35 buy point after a pullback to its 50-day moving average. The government IT systems contractor is up more than 200% since its October 2005 IPO. A couple of top-rated stocks bucked the day's uptrend. California Water Service (CWT) gushed higher early in the day, surging as high as 48.28. But the San Jose-based water utility reversed sharply. It closed down 0.57 at 45.86 in brisk turnover, closing near the bottom of its intraday trading range. Monro Muffler (MNRO) skidded 1.16 to 24.34 in nearly double its typical turnover. The operator of muffler and brake shops broke out of a double-bottom-with-handle base on Wednesday. The stock gave back a big chunk of those gains Friday, though it remains above its 24.18 buy point. Elsewhere, General Motors (GM) rallied 14%. The move came after the government paid out the first $4 billion in emergency loans to the troubled automaker. Bank of America (BAC) closed on its acquisition of Merrill Lynch, and Wells Fargo (WFC) completed its buyout of Wachovia. The market rallied even though the economy delivered some more bad tidings. The ISM's manufacturing index dropped to 32.4 in December from 36.2 in November. The result was well below the 35.4 figure forecast by economists. Still, it's worth remembering that the stock market always looks ahead, often six months or more. The market has rallied many times throughout history with a recession still in full swing. In commodities news, February crude oil rose $1.74 to settle at $46.34 a barrel. That move gave a number of energy stocks a boost. Three of the top six performers on IBD's list of 197 industry groups hailed from the energy sector. Treasury prices dived on the big stock rally. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note surged to 2.41% from 2.22% on Wednesday.
