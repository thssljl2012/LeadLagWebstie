Thu 15 Jan, 2009 21:53    By John Parry    NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street shares closed slightly higher on Thursday on hopes the government might provide fresh capital to ailing banks to assuage the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression.    A steep fall in oil prices to below $35 per barrel, which could mitigate harsh economic conditions for businesses and consumers, helped the Dow Jones industrial average recoup after it dropped below 8,000 points for the first time since the market's November 21 bear market low.    However, as early steep falls in Citigroup and Bank of America underscored, investors remained very concerned about the prospects for some of the biggest U.S. banks.    Safer-haven U.S. government bonds tapped an intermittent bid from jittery investors, seemingly uncertain whether more government rescue attempts would be enough to stabilise several major financial institutions.    Shares of Bank of America , the largest U.S. bank, fell 18.4 percent to $8.32. Citigroup shares fell as well, down 15.5 percent to $3.83 a day before the bank was due to report its quarterly results and a new strategic direction.    Analysts said the need for more financial sector aid pointed to mounting credit losses as the year-long U.S. recession deepens.        "I think it's tremendously disappointing that the banks continue to flounder," said Carl Birkelbach, head of Birkelbach Management in Chicago. "What's going on here is that the first batch of the (financial bailout) funds was supposed to put out the fire, but now it looks like the fire is coming up again."    The Dow Jones industrial average &lt;.DJI&gt; ended up 12.35 points, or 0.15 percent, to 8,212.49. The S&amp;P 500 Index &lt;.SPX&gt; gained 1.12 points, or 0.13 percent, to close at 843.74. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 22.20 points, or 1.49 percent, to finish at 1,511.84.    The dollar rose against the yen but fell against currencies from some countries with high interest rates as hopes that the U.S. government would give more money to troubled banks encouraged investors to edge back into higher-risk assets such as stocks.    The euro hit a five-week low against the dollar on Thursday as traders worried the European Central Bank was moving too slowly to cut interest rates. The European Central Bank reduced rates by half a percentage point and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 ended 1 percent lower.    It was the fourth rate cut in just over three months for the ECB, triggered by signs the financial crisis is biting hard into the real economy and inflation threatens to slow further below the bank's 2 percent ceiling.    Overall, investors said they expect the ECB will slash rates further following Thursday's move, despite mixed signals from ECB president Jean-Claude Trichet over the timing of the next cut.    "Markets are wondering: 'What is Trichet saying? Is he living in a bubble?'," asked Greg Salvaggio, vice president of trading at Tempus Consulting in Washington.    "I think it tarnishes his credibility a bit. The British and the U.S. have thrown the kitchen sink at the problem, but it seems he's not willing to do what's necessary," he added.    OIL DOWN, TREASURIES FLAT    U.S. crude futures ended more than 5 percent lower on Thursday on a bleak OPEC global demand forecast, gloomy domestic economic mews and brimming domestic oil supplies.    On the New York Mercantile Exchange, February crude settled down $1.88, or 5.04 percent, at $35.40 a barrel.    In the debt market, U.S. Treasury prices traded near flat, with investors reluctant to buy government debt as benchmark yields hovered not far above five-decade lows.    The benchmark 10-year Treasury note's price, which moves inversely to its yield, traded down 1/32 for a yield of 2.21 percent.
