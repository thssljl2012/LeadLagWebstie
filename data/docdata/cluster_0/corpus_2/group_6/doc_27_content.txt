As far as the fairly bullish moves go on this stock, something is not quiet right, barclays is one of the worst performer on ftse100 today and testing its last bottom and lloyds and rbs are struggling above yesterdays levels despite the market being up.    You'd think after two really bad days on already beaten down stocks they would at least rally a bit and hold without hitting new lows especially in an up market (ftse up nearly 2%) and so far that is not happening.    I could be way off but something don't fit, the confidence really is not here or in this sector at all.    It could improve if the results on those other banks come through better than expected, i'd not bet on it though.    Might regret staying out if i'm wrong, but this is an even riskier position than a few months ago, or it looks that way to me.
