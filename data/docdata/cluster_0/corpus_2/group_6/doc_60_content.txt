After initially spurring a jump in oil prices, the Gaza conflict has been largely ignored by traders because it hasn't affected major supplies and no oil-rich Middle East neighbors have become directly involved.    &amp;nbsp;    "The impact on oil supply is obviously limited," Moore said.    &amp;nbsp;    Prices of futures contracts for later this year are higher than the February contract on investor expectations that announced production cuts of 4.2 million barrels a day since September by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will begin to reduce global supply.    &amp;nbsp;    The June contract trades at $50.40 a barrel.    &amp;nbsp;    "There's some wariness that the OPEC actions may cause markets to tighten up," said Moore, who expects oil to average $55 a barrel this year.    &amp;nbsp;    "OPEC is starting to get concerned -- again -- and the ministers are determined to generate a rally," said a report from U.S. energy consultancy Cameron Hanover, which urged the U.S. government to increase the level of its Strategic Petroleum Reserves.    &amp;nbsp;    "It would help raise prices to a level that could get OPEC feeling less vulnerable (and less likely to cut output again) at the same time that it would save the surplus for later," Cameron Hanover said.    &amp;nbsp;    Investors are also looking for signs that demand from emerging markets, which helped drive oil's rise to $147.27 a barrel in July, will rebound.         &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;   Just amazing the closer the day get to Bush and Cheney leaving office the oil prices declines.        Silence was never written down
