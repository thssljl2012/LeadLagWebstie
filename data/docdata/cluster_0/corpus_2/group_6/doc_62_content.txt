       Rogers Says U.K. Finished    http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=agxlt5ZPtyLA   Jim Rogers, chairman of Singapore-based Rogers Holdings, said  the U.K. is finished and investors should sell the currency.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia said there was a high risk of a  cut to the countrys credit rating outlook and lowered its pound  forecast. Prime Minister Gordon Brown authorized a 100 billion  pound ($142 billion) bailout for banks.  I would urge you to sell any sterling you might have, said  Rogers. Its finished. I hate to say it, but I would not put  any money in the U.K. Rogers correctly predicted the start of  the commodities rally in 1999.
