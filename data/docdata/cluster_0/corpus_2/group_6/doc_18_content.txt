MARKET SNAPSHOT: Bank Of America's Dividend Cut One Of Many Facing Investors 01/16 11:20 am (DJN) By Kate Gibson The financial shares driving the market higher on Friday were basking in a glow rarely seen in recent months, with S&amp;P 500 investors in 2009 facing the worst dividends in at least half a century. "I've been chicken to put out the 2009 dividend forecast. I usually do it in December, but I'm waiting to see what happens in Washington," said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst, Standard &amp; Poor's. The latest steps by the government to stem the financial crisis on Friday helped lift the financial sector as well as the broader market, with equities bouncing back for a second session after a string of losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) climbed 86.34 points, or 1.1%, to 8,300.74, with 23 of its 30 components posting gains. The S&amp;P 500 (SPX) added 8.09 points, or 1%, to stand at 851.83 and the Nasdaq Composite (RIXF) gained 11.91 points, or 0.8%, to 1,523.75. "We saw that fourth-quarter dividends were very bad, and some of those companies actually paid out in the fourth quarter, and then reduced in November and December. The full impact has not been felt by investors yet, and more is on the way. Even on the optimistic side, we're probably going to get a 50-year record in the percent of decline over 2008," said Silverblatt. Case in point: Bank of America Corp.'s dividend reduction from $1.28 to 4 cents, a slashing that brings the S&amp;P 500 payout and yield down by 3.4%, according to Silverblatt's calculations. Bank of America axed its dividend and posted its first loss since 1991 after the government said it would invest an additional $20 billion in the financial firm and guarantee $118 billion of assets as B. of A. digests Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. . A former dividend aristocrat -- a term reserved for companies that have paid out at least 25 years in a row, hiking each time -- Bank of America's (BAC) recent reduction follows an October reduction from $2.56 to $1.28 after more than a quarter of a century of increases.
