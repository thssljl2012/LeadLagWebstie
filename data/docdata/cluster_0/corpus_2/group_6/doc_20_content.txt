US Stocks at a Glance US Stocks See Broad Gains; Utilities Strong Stocks registered a broad-based but modest gain Friday as the financial sector stabilized following new moves by the government to shore up two ailing Wall Street bellwethers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was recently up 97 points, or 1.2%, at 8309.74. Among its components, Bank of America slipped 2.7% after a $20 billion injection of government funds to bolster its balance sheet, but Citigroup was up 6.8% after the government moved to back $400 billion of its assets. Each company reported massive losses for the fourth quarter, including $1.79 billion of red ink at Bank of America and $8.29 billion for Citigroup. Merrill Lynch, which was acquired by Bank of America in a deal that didn't close until after the fourth quarter, lost over $15 billion. Citigroup also said it would split into two business units, with one unit made up of brokerage and retail asset management, local consumer finance and a special asset pool. The broader financial sector remained the stock market's weakest category on Friday, holding near break-even in recent action. But that performance is a relatively welcome development for investors who in recent days have often witnessed deep slides in financial stocks spill into other corners the market. Those bouts of selling have confounded bulls, many of whom argue that the market adequately priced in the risks ahead during its late-2008 plunge. "I still believe this is primarily a crisis of confidence, not fundamentals," said strategist Jim Paulsen, of Wells Capital Management, in Minneapolis. "The bogeyman in the closet is more frightening than what we know to be true." The S&amp;P 500 was recently up 1.3% at 854.27, with all its sectors posting gains in recent action. Utilities , a traditional defensive bet, were the strongest category, up nearly 2%. Consumer staples and financials were the weakest, up less than 0.3% each. Other market yardsticks rose. The small-stock Russell 2000 advanced 0.4% to 464.26. The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.1% to trade at 1528.79, helped by a 2.1% rise in Intel after the world's top chip maker reported a 90% profit drop, in line with analysts' estimates. In economic news, U.S. consumer prices fell 0.7% in December on a seasonally adjusted basis compared to the previous month, the Labor Department said Friday, after falling at a record pace in November. Economists had expected a 0.8% decline. Consumer prices rose just 0.1% in 2008 as a whole, the lowest increase since 1954 and well below the Federal Reserve's 1.5% to 2% preference over the long run. Crude-oil prices advanced despite a prediction of slumping energy demand from the International Energy Agency. Futures rose $1.15 to $36.55 a barrel in New York. Treasury prices fell. The two-year note shed 2/32 to yield 0.753%. The 10-year note fell 1-15/32 to yield 2.359%. The dollar was mixed, strengthening versus the euro but trading lower against the yen. The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the greenback's value against a basket of six overseas denominations, slipped 0.5%.
