Market Update 090127 http://biz.yahoo.com/mu/update.html 4:30 pm : Action was choppy and trading volume was light this session, but stocks were able to close higher for the third straight session. Financial stocks (+3.7%) finished as the best performing sector with gains being shared by big and small players alike. American Express (AXP 16.68, +1.48) was one of the strongest performers in the sector and the Dow, for that matter. Though the company missed analysts' quarterly estimates, and management expects write-offs to rise, investors were relieved the company didn't report any truly horrendous developments. Given the challenges facing financial companies and consumers, investors have become conditioned to expect lower earnings and higher accounting charges. Such was the case with Zions Bank (ZION 14.08, +1.89), which reported a deeper-than-expected loss and increased reserves. Still, the stock logged its best single-session advance in three months, and provided support to regional banks (+3.6%). Wells Fargo (WFC 16.19, +0.71) contributed the most leadership to the financial sector, though. The diversified bank reports its latest quarterly results tomorrow. Wall Street expects earnings of $0.33 per share. Healthy gains were also had in the health care sector, which finished higher after Bristol-Myers (BMY 23.13, +0.88) and McKesson (MCK 45.22, +4.82) topped analysts' quarterly earnings estimates. Amgen (AMGN 53.09, -1.32), however, missed expectations. Semiconductors also had a solid session, thanks to leadership from Texas Instruments (TXN 15.31, +0.54). Texas Instruments reported lower earnings, a reduced outlook, and plans to layoff 12% of its workforce, but the announcements weren't altogether surprising considering similar reports already made by Intel (INTC 13.81, +0.43). Steel emerged as a strong performer after industry stalwarts U.S. Steel (X 31.49, +2.03) and Nucor (NUE 39.80, +2.34) posted better-than-expected results. Expectations were low in light of weak macro conditions. Steel stocks in the S&amp;P 500 logged their best single-session advance in more than one month. However, AK Steel (AKS 8.64, -0.76) failed to participate in the bounce after it reported a deep loss. The overall strength in steel helped advance the materials sector, where Rohm &amp; Haas (ROH 58.75, +1.65) was a relative leader. Rohm &amp; Haas fell Monday after Dow (DOW 13.19, -0.05) reported it would not be closing its offer for Rohm &amp; Haas by today. Buyout hopes remain alive, though, according to comments by Dow's chief executive in a CNBC interview. Meanwhile, industry peer DuPont (DD 23.27, +0.09) posted a worse-than-expected loss for the latest quarter, and lowered its outlook. However, amid the collapse of the Rohm &amp; Haas - Dow deal, investors were largely prepared for DuPont's results. Retail stocks were among the session's weakest performers. The group traded lower as investors reacted to reports suggesting the National Retail Federation expects retail sales to fall a 0.5% from last year. Home improvement retailers (-2.6%) were hit especially hard. Telecom stocks (-3.0%) logged the worst performance of any sector in the S&amp;P 500. Verizon (VZ 29.96, -1.03) was a laggard in its space and in the Dow even though its earnings met expectations. AT&amp;T (T 25.93, -0.90) traded lower in related weakness; the company is scheduled to announce its latest earnings results tomorrow morning. Though the stock market was able to extend its winning streak with this session's advance, the move seemed to lack conviction as less than 1.2 billion shares traded hands on the NYSE. More than 35 companies will announce quarterly results ahead of tomorrow's opening bell, but market participants will be looking forward to the latest Federal Open Market Committee statement. Now that the fed funds target ranges from 0.00% to 0.25%, investors will be looking for hints regarding the committee's methods of steering the economy without using rate cuts. The latest crude oil inventory data is also due tomorrow. Traders expect a build of inventory, given persistently weak demand. Demand concerns seemed to return to focus this session. After crude futures climbed more than 20% last week, traders pushed crude oil futures more than 9% lower this session. Crude finished near $41.60 per barrel.DJ30 +58.70 NASDAQ +15.44 SP500 +9.14 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1679/1.82 bln/1014 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 2078/1.17 bln/950 3:30 pm : March crude oil contracts finished a very weak session. Renewed worries about the economy fueled fears of decreased demand, which undercut early gains. March contracts finished more than 9.0% lower, just off session lows at $41.58 per barrel. Crude had traded as much as 3.9% higher at its session highs. The February contract for Natural gas expires tomorrow. The contracts ended the day nearly unchanged after trading as high as $4.598 per contract. Contracts straddled the unchanged mark most of the session and closed at $4.496, up less than a penny. February Gold contracts traded in the red for the entire session. The contracts hung around the $900 level for most of the session and closed down 1% to $899.50. After trading as low as $11.855 in the morning session, March silver contracts spent most of the day gaining ground. March silver finished the day marginally higher at $12.175 per contract.DJ30 +84.99 NASDAQ +20.51 SP500 +11.99 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1714/1.50 bln/958 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 2081/864 mln/928 3:00 pm : Stocks are back on an upward trend as market participants enter the final hour of trading. Action this afternoon has been rather quiet as share trading volume remains relatively low. Less than 775 million shares have traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange this session.DJ30 +51.30 NASDAQ +15.21 SP500 +7.79 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1657/1.35 bln/1001 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 1977/775 mln/1032 2:30 pm : Stocks continue to sport solid gains, but the major indices are peeling back from earlier levels. The descent has pushed consumer discretionary stocks and energy stocks into the red. The consumer discretionary sector is down 0.4% amid weakness in retailers. According to the National Retail Federation, retail sales are expected to decline 0.5% from last year. Retailers, as a group, are now down 2.3%. Energy is down 0.6% amid falling crude prices. Crude is now down 8.9% to trade hands at $41.65 per barrel. DJ30 +14.42 NASDAQ +8.85 SP500 +3.41 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1577/1.242 bln/1052 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 1845/713 mln/1144 2:00 pm : The Dow is lagging its counterparts amid ongoing weakness in integrated telecom giants Verizon (VZ 29.77, -1.22) and AT&amp;T (T 26.17, -0.66). Still, 25 of the 30 Dow components are trading with gains. Afternoon trading remains choppy. Treasuries have shaken off early weakness to trade with gains. The benchmark 10-year Note is now up nearly a full point, which has pushed its yield down to 2.53%.DJ30 +41.58 NASDAQ +13.28 SP500 +6.78 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1600/1.13 bln/1013 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 1959/648 mln/1009 1:30 pm : Retail stocks are trading with marked weakness this session. The S&amp;P 500 retailers index is down 0.8% amid weakness from home improvement retailers Lowe's (LOW 20.04, -0.61) and Home Depot (HD 22.21, -0.52). The drop in shares of LOW and HD retrace gains registered in the prior session. The prior session's advance followed an announcement that Home Depot planned to exit certain businesses, which would impact some 7,000 employees. Home Depot reaffirmed its full-year outlook, as well.DJ30 +64.12 NASDAQ +17.16 SP500 +9.37 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1646/1.02 bln/935 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 2003/584 mln/928 1:00 pm : Each of the major indices continues to trade with a solid gain. The advance has been broad-based as investors focus on earnings results from several key companies. Investors are shunning telecom stocks (-2.3%) in the wake of Verizon's (VZ 29.92, -1.07) latest quarterly announcement. Though the company's earnings met expectations, its shares are under pressure. Shares of AT&amp;T (T 26.18, -0.65) are trading lower amid related weakness; the company is scheduled to announce its latest earnings results tomorrow. At the other end of the spectrum, financial stocks (+2.7%) are trading with larger gains than any other sector. Its advance was initially induced by American Express (AXP 16.41, +1.21). The company's latest results fell short of expectations, and it indicated write-offs are expected to rise in the coming quarters. However, given the conditions facing financial companies and consumers, the results were better than many feared. Though its influence in the broader market is relatively limited, steel stocks are garnering positive attention in the wake of better-than-expected results from key industry players U.S. Steel (X 31.60, +2.14) and Nucor (NUE 40.53, +3.07). Expectations were low for the industry, given the combination of weak demand, customer inventory reductions, and difficult credit conditions. Steel stocks are currently on pace to log their best single-session advance in more than one month. Health care stocks (+2.3%) are also sporting gains. Bristol-Myers (BMY 23.50, +1.25) is providing leadership after topping analysts' earnings expectations, but Amgen (AMGN 52.98, -1.43) is trading as a laggard after falling short of expectations. Dow component DuPont (DD 23.36, +0.18) has shaken off early weakness to trade with a gain. The chemicals outfit posted a worse-than-expected loss for the latest quarter, and lowered its outlook. Challenges already facing peers Dow (DOW 13.35, +0.11) and Rohm and Haas (ROH 59.67, +2.57) seemed to prepare investors for bad news from DuPont. Texas Instruments (TXN 15.33, +0.56) is providing strength to semiconductor stocks, which have been hit by blunt headwinds amid dour economic conditions. TXN's advance comes even though the firm reported a drop in earnings, reduced its outlook, and announced plans to layoff 12% of its workforce.DJ30 +73.44 NASDAQ +20.05 SP500 +10.71 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1668/936 mln/904 NYSE Adv/Vol/...
