                        Daily Review. 16th January, 2009       Russian indices drifted south Thursday on external weakness and worse-than-expected unemployment data. As a result, the RTS Index sank 3.76% and the MICEX Index ended 0.77% lower.       Oil and gas issuers outperformed the market on rebounding crude futures, with Rosneft rising 1.3%, Lukoil advancing 1.4% and Surgutneftegaz adding on 0.9%. Demand for Gazprom, down 1%, was limited due to the ongoing gas conflict with Ukraine. Bank stocks again saw losses as the ruble continues to weaken, as Sberbank dropped 1.9% and VTB edged down 0.3%. Steel makers, save NLMK (+1.6%), underperformed, as MMK plummeted 3.8% and Severstal fell 3.3%.       Despite bearish movements through the session American indices finished Thursday in the black. Specifically, the Dow added on 0.15%. On the one hand, negative unemployment data exerted adverse pressure on the market, while, on the other hand, expectations about state support to the Bank of America buoyed the market. Asian markets are bullish this morning, recovering from Wednesdays losses. Although the oil cartel lowered its forecast for crude demand, oil futures are heading north, trading in the range of USD 43-48 a barrel.       We view Friday mornings news flow as moderately upbeat for the Russian equity market. A rebound in oil contracts will likely lend support to the oil patch and the market as a whole. Domestic bank stocks will remain under pressure as the national currency continues to weaken. The release of US CPI and manufacturing data could also impact Friday trading.
