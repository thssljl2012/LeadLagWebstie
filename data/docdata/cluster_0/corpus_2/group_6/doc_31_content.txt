         Dreman's latest:  http://www.forbes.com/personalfinance/forbes/2009/0202/087.h...   It was the worst of times...   "Most of the 49 stocks I recommended in this column in 2008 were unable to escape the damage. If you had bought them all, you'd be down 26%, after subtracting a 1% transaction cost on new purchases. Similarly timed investments in the S&amp;P 500 would have lost you 16%. (None of the figures here include dividends.) My mistake: being heavily weighted in financials, and being unable to predict which ones (like Citi and AIG) would get help from the federal government and which would be allowed to sink beneath the waves."   It  is  the best of times...   Amidst this Dickensian darkness in our economy I also believe that it is the best of times if you happen to be a value investor like me. I am now seeing buying opportunities that I have rarely seen in my 32 years managing money.   Of the 49 shares he tipped last year Dreman continues to recommend the following 21. Financial: Bank of America, Fifth Third. Retail: Lowe's, Staples. Oilies: Apache Corp, Devon Energy, Anadarko Petroleum, Chesapeake Energy, Transocean, ConocoPhillips, Chevron, Occidental. Resources: BHP Billiton, Freeport-McMoran. Aerospace and defense: Lockheed Martin, United Technologies. Others: Best Buy, Carnival, Target, General Electric and Valero Energy.  He hasn't made any new tips for 2009.  Interestingly, given that the emphasis on oil and resources in the list, Dreman thinks that the price of oil and other commodities will go lower.  Evidently he regards these sectors as very oversold.  toothbrush
