Bank stocks plunge on fresh insolvency fears By STEVENSON JACOBS, AP Business Writer Stevenson Jacobs, Ap Business Writer  7 mins ago NEW YORK  Shares of major U.S. banks plunged Thursday as the government mulled giving Bank of America Corp. a fresh multibillion-dollar aid package, raising fears on Wall Street that the battered financial sector may need an even bigger bailout.  Bank of America shares fell as much as 28 percent  dropping to their lowest level in 18 years  on news that the bank may seek another capital injection to manage losses from its takeover of Merrill Lynch. Citigroup Inc. shares fell to a near 16-year low as investors braced for horrible fourth-quarter earnings due Friday. And JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. added to the pessimism with a grim earnings outlook. Shares of all three banks came off their lows later in the day as part of a broad market turnaround.
