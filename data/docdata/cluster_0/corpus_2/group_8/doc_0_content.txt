Japan's Nikkei 225 index was down 314.08 points, or 4.2%, at 7,254.34. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng fell 3.83% to 12,321.04 points.   Investor confidence was hit by talk that US insurance giant AIG may need a further injection of government cash.   Weak economic data from China and South Korea also underscored fears about Asia's export-dependent economies.   China's manufacturing sector declined further last month, while South Korean imports and exports also slumped. Japan reported a steep drop in car sales.   Monday's slide followed a poor performance on Wall Street on Friday after data showed that economic growth was even weaker than thought.   "You're seeing the US is sinking lower and lower, and we're still desperately searching for a bottom," said John Mar, co-head of sales trading at Daiwa Securities SMBC Co.   European markets were also expected to open lower.          Thanks    PlanningYourTax (dot) com
