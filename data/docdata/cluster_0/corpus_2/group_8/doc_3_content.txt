 Economy worries hit global shares          Global stocks have fallen sharply on fears the global financial sector could take a further turn for the worse.         In Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 fell by 4.2%, while Germany's Dax was down 2.8% and France's Cac 40 lost 3.6%.         Earlier in Asia, Japan's Nikkei index closed down 3.8% at 7,280.15, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 3.9%.         Confidence was hit by a fresh $30bn bail-out of US insurance giant AIG, and news that UK bank HSBC aimed to raise 12.5bn from its shareholders.         HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, said it would use the money raised from the rights issue to help the bank cope with the effects of the global economic downturn.         The bank also said pre-tax profits for 2008 were $9.3bn (6.5bn), down 62% on the previous year after it wrote down the value of US assets by more than $10bn.         "The big issue [for markets] is the fact that HSBC - one of the biggest and strongest banks around - is having such problems," said Jonathan Jackson and Killik &amp; Co.          http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7918168.stm
