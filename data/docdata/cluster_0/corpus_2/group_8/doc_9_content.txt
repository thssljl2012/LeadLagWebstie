Stocks close on record high            THE share market has closed at another record high, buoyed by market leader BHP Billiton and a strong showing from banks and insurers.      At the 1615 AEDT close, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 48.1 points to 5,607.8, breaking the previous record of 5,591.40 set on Monday, December 18.      It also closed at a new intraday high, beating its earlier high of 5,597.20, set on Monday as well.      The all ordinaries gained 45.3 points to 5,586.90, likewise surpassing its previous closing high of 5,572.2 and beating the previous intraday high of 5577.30.      Both records were also set on December 18.      CMC Markets senior dealer Phil Martin said the big miners had led the market up despite small falls in base metal prices overnight.      "BHP was the biggest one causing the market to head higher,'' Mr Martin said.      "Most of the metals were slightly lower but oil moved sharply higher, which would have helped BHP a little.      "But Rio's also up, so it looks like gains have come on the back of some positive general sentiment.      "The time of year always helps, and yesterday we had a few stocks down so people are seeing some cheaper stocks around the market.      Mr Martin said the banks had performed well, particularly National Australia Bank and Commonwealth Bank.      So too had the insurers, with Suncorp and Promina the big winners after their $7.9 billion merger was today approved by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).      BHP added 45 cents to $25.77 and Rio Tinto lifted 81 cents to $76.39.      Suncorp rose 45 cents to $20.25 and Promina jumped 22 cents, or 3.28 per cent, to $6.92.      Other insurers also rose with QBE firming 52 cents to $28.62, AMP growing six cents to $9.80 and Axa Asia Pacific advancing 24 cents to $7.09.      National Australia Bank made 31 cents to $40.11, Commonwealth Bank lifted 93 cents to $48.85, ANZ was steady at $48.85 and Westpac climbed eight cents to $23.94.      St George Bank put on 22 cents to $32.70 after announcing today that it remains on track for to meet targets of 10 per cent cash earnings per share growth for 2007 and 2008.      Macquarie Bank gained 94 cents to $75.55.    End.      I think it is, not a lot of other good news in the market, seems everyone is waiting for the next PE bid, a bubble is being created.
