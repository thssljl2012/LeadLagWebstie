   Oil Falls for a Second Day as Recession May Reduce Fuel Demand        By Christian Schmollinger       http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601072&amp;sid=aKUyg.uFXb3E&amp;refer=energy                   March 2 (Bloomberg) -- Crude oil fell for a second day as a contraction in China's manufacturing, a drop in South Korean exports and lower Japanese wages added to evidence that the global recession will reduce demand for fuel.    Oil also declined before an Institute of Supply Management report today that may show U.S. manufacturing contracted in February from the previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. China's manufacturing shrank for a seventh month and South Korean exports tumbled for a fourth month in February. In Japan, wage declines accelerated in January.    "This negative news on the economic data isn't going away anytime soon," said   Jonathan Kornafel , a director for Asia at Hudson Capital Energy in Singapore. "If the U.S. isn't buying oil, they aren't buying other things and that affects the manufacturing numbers here in Asia, which will affect gasoline and fuel oil needs in the region."    "The bigger picture remains one of economic weakness in the U.S.," said   David Moore , a commodity strategist with Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd. in Sydney. The economic data "raises concerns about weakness in commodity consumption, including oil," he said.    U.S. employers may have cut payrolls by 650,000, the most since 1949, and the jobless rate probably surged to 7.9 percent, according to the median estimates in a Bloomberg News survey ahead of Labor Department figures March 6.    Officials from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the supplier of 40 percent of the world's oil, gave conflicting signals on their intentions to further cut output to bolster prices when they meet in Vienna on March 15.
