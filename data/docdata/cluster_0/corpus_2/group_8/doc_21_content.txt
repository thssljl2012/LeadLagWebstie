   U.S. Futures, Asian Stocks, Dollar Decline After Fed Cuts Discount Rate         By Patrick Rial      March 17 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stock index futures, Asian equities, and the dollar tumbled after  the Federal Reserve cut its discount interest rate at an emergency meeting  and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. agreed to buy Bear Stearns Cos. for $2 a share. Bonds climbed.      All Asian stock benchmarks fell, led by financial shares including National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. in Tokyo. Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slumped more than 3 percent. The dollar sank to a record low against the euro and the Swiss franc and fell to the weakest in 12 years against the yen.  Gold and crude oil rose to a record.       ``This is a  serious crisis ,'' said David Goldman, senior portfolio strategist at Asteri Capital in New York and former head of debt research at Banc of America Securities LLC. ``Something is systemically very wrong and we're at  a very dangerous moment. ''      The  Fed decision to cut the rate on direct loans to commercial banks by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent  was aimed at restoring confidence in  financial markets shaken by the collapse of Bear Stearns and more than $195 billion in asset writedowns and credit losses worldwide.  The action coincided with JPMorgan buying Bear Stearns for about $240 million,    less than a 10th of its value last week   .       Dollar `Crisis'       Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index futures expiring in June slumped 2.3 percent to 1263.70 as of 1:55 p.m. in Tokyo. The S&amp;P 500 is 2.3 percentage points away from a bear market, as defined by a 20 percent drop from a peak. The index dropped 12.3 percent this year. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.8 percent to 133.54 and is 23 percent off its high in November. The Nikkei 225 tumbled 2.9 percent, while  the Hang Seng plunged 4 percent.        The dollar weakened to as low as 95.76 yen , a level not seen since August 1995, from 99.09 on March 14.  It dropped to a record low of $1.5903 per euro  and an  all-time low of 0.9638 Swiss francs . Treasuries rose, causing the 10-year yield to fall 12 basis points to 3.34 percent as  traders bet the U.S. central bank will lower its benchmark rate by a full percentage point when it meets tomorrow . Japan's 10-year government bond yield fell 1.5 basis points to 1.245 percent.       Gold for immediate delivery climbed as much as 3 percent to a record $1,032 an ounce  as investors sought a haven against the weakening currency.  Crude oil gained as much as 1.1 percent to a record $111.42.       ``The dollar is facing a credibility crisis,'' said Koji Fukaya, a senior currency strategist at Deutsche Securities, the Tokyo unit of Deutsche Bank AG, the world's largest currency trader. ``All the markets are entering a vicious cycle.''       Bear Stearns       Financial shares led declines in Asia. National Australia Bank Ltd., the nation's biggest lender, slid 2.8 percent to A$26.88. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial, Japan's biggest lender by market value, slumped 5.4 percent to 784 yen. Woori Finance Holdings Co., South Korea's third-largest financial services company by market value, tumbled 4.8 percent to 16,000 won.      ``Facilitating a purchase of Bear by JPMorgan is, in effect, more Band-Aids when the patient needs surgery,'' said Ed Rogers, chief executive officer of Rogers Investment Advisors Y.K., which operates a fund of hedge funds. ``There is a lot more pain to come.''      The $2 dollar price for Bear Stearns indicates how close the company was to collapse and raises concern that other U.S. financial companies may fail, said Takero Inaizumi, a manager at Mizuho Investors Securities Co. in Tokyo. Bear Stearns shares closed at $30 on March 14, down 47 percent on that day alone.      ``It's dire,'' said Angus Gluskie, who helps manage the equivalent of $500 million at White Funds Management in Sydney. The Fed's actions are ``indicative of the very significant credit issues we've got globally at the moment.''       Default Swaps       The cost to protect corporate bonds from default in the Asia-Pacific region surged to records after the announcement of JPMorgan's purchase. The benchmark credit-default swap index in Japan gained 37 basis points to 248 basis points in Tokyo, according to Morgan Stanley. The Australian index increased 10.5 basis points to 213 basis points, according to Citigroup Inc. The rising cost indicates that investors see an increasing risk of companies defaulting on their debt.      The so-called TED spread, the difference between what the U.S. government and companies pay for three-month loans, was near the highest this year at 1.61 percentage points, indicating banks are less willing to lend.       Currency Market       The Australian and New Zealand dollars fell on speculation investors will spurn higher-yielding currencies as financial turmoil deepens. Australia's currency declined to 92.18 U.S. cents from 93.74 cents. The New Zealand dollar weakened to 80.31 U.S. cents from 81.34 cents. The British pound fell to $2.0112 from $2.0202. South Korea's won fell 3.1 percent to 1,027.80 per dollar, the weakest since December 2005.      ``The rest of the world remains convinced that this is largely America's problem,'' said Stephen Roach, Asia chairman of Morgan Stanley, the second-biggest U.S. securities firm. ``This is also likely to be wishful thinking.''       Japan's Finance Minister  Fukushiro Nukaga, who has the power to intervene in currency markets, said recent moves by the yen are ``excessive.'' The government is not considering any specific action at the moment, he said.      Sony Corp., the world's second-biggest consumer electronics maker, slumped 5.5 percent to 3,970 yen. Nomura Holdings Inc. lowered its rating on the shares on the view that earnings will be curbed with the yen above 100 versus the dollar.      Global stock markets have lost $2.4 trillion in market value, or 3.8 percent, from a peak in October to $60 trillion as of March 14. That partly reflects the slump in the U.S. dollar, which has boosted the value of European and Asian equities.
