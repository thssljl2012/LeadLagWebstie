           Asian stocks and dollar sink on Bear rescue and Fed cut                  Quote:               HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian stocks sank on Monday to their lowest level since August 2007 and the dollar tumbled, as the fire sale of ailing U.S. bank Bear Stearns and the Federal Reserve's emergency cut in its discount rate intensified concerns that  there could be more victims of the global credit crisis.         U.S. stock futures fell in Asian trade, pointing to a sharply lower Wall Street open later in the day, as global investors wonder if other financial institutions might need rescuing. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 30 points, while Dow Jones industrial average futures dropped more than 200 points.        The fall in the dollar, which sank to a record low against the euro, sent spot gold and crude futures hurling towards record highs, deepening concerns of rising inflationary pressures throughout the region.            Please tell me they're going to have this under control before the GDP of Luxembourg surpasses ours.
