  By Parvathy Ullatil           HONG KONG, March 6 (Reuters)  -   Hong Kong shares fell 1.3 percent on Friday,   with HSBC leading losses amid a global rout in bank stocks, while China stocks   also retreated after Beijing failed to deliver new stimulus spending.             HSBC was down 1.9 percent at HK$43.95, its lowest level in nearly 13   years, shedding the small gain it made the previous session. Its Hong Kong unit,   Hang Seng Bank, slid for a fifth straight day, falling 5.28 percent to HK$75.30,   after the lender reported a sharp drop in second half earnings on Monday.           "You just have to look at how Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Barclays   performed on Thursday to understand why banking stocks are down today. Fear has   gripped the sector," said Alex Wong, director with Ample Finance.           Wong said losses in HSBC shares were limited ahead of the Hang Seng Index   rebalancing, which will see the stock's weighting increased to 15 percent from   11.33 percent when it comes into effect on Monday. After the rebalancing, HSBC   will overtake China Mobile to become the most heavily weighted stock on the main   index.           The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended the morning session down 155.25   points at 12,055.99.           Other financial stocks were also hit, with local lender BOC Hong Kong   down 3.6 percent while Bank of East Asia , where both the CEO and the CFO have   resigned, dropped 3 percent to HK$13.64.           But Chinese lender China Construction Bank rose 0.5 percent ahead of the   index rebalancing which will boost its weighting to 8.01 percent from 5.9   percent.           Canada's top insurer, Manulife Financial Corp , took another tumble,   sliding 10.3 percent to HK$62.15 after its Toronto-listed scrip plunged on   Thursday.            The stock has lost nearly 50 percent of its market value in the last two   weeks as global markets dropped, hitting the insurer's key regulatory capital   ratio.           Turnover came in at HK$20.4 billion.           The China Enterprises Index of top mainland firms was down 1.4 percent at   6,805.69.           Shares in offshore oil specialist CNOOC fell 3 percent to HK$6.09 as oil   prices dropped overnight and stayed below $44 per barrel in Asian trade on a   bearish euro zone outlook.           Asia's top oil and gas producer, PetroChina, shed 1.7 percent to fall to   HK$5.17 while refiner Sinopec Corp  was down 3.6 percent.           Other commodity stocks also pulled back, partly erasing recent gains,   with Aluminum Corp of China (Chalco) down 3.1 percent and coal miner China Coal   Energy 3.2 percent lower at HK$4.53.           But gold miners bucked the downtrend in the broad market even as the gold   price eased a touch on Friday after rising 2 percent overnight on its safe-haven   appeal.           Zijin Mining was up 1.4 percent while Lingbao Gold  gained 4.4 percent.             (Reporting by Parvathy Ullatil; Editing by Nick Macfie)
