Asian markets fell on Tuesday, with financial stocks such as HSBC and Shinsei Bank suffering steep declines on worries about rising bad loans at banks in the region as well as in the US.        Japanese stocks were also weighed down as a strengthened yen hurt exporters, while Hong Kong shares were dragged lower by China Mobile a day after it announced quarterly earnings. The Nikkei 225 Average finished 2.4 per cent lower at 8711.33 in Tokyo and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index shed 3.0 per cent to finish at 15,285.89.        Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 dropped 2.4 per cent, South Korea's Kospi ended flat, China's Shanghai Composite lost 0.9 per cent, Taiwan's Taiex rose 1.7 per cent and New Zealand's NZX 50 shrank 1.3 per cent.        Malaysia's Kuala Lumpur Composite Index closed down 0.2 per cent and the Philippines' main index gave up 1.8 per cent. Thailand's SET Index was little changed, while Indonesian shares dropped 2.0 per cent.        Singapore shares closed 0.66 per cent higher as late-session bargain-hunting reversed losses earlier in the day. After slipping by as much as 3.0 per cent in early trade, the blue-chip Straits Times Index finished the day 12.40 points higher at 1,887.25.        Among financials, Westpac Banking fell 2.6 per cent in Sydney, while Shinsei Bank lost 4.1 per cent and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group shed one per cent in Tokyo. KB Financial Group gave up 3.1 per cent in Seoul while HSBC tumbled 5.1 per cent in Hong Kong.        The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.6 per cent on Monday, its largest percentage decline since March 5, after fresh jitters emerged over the health of the US banking sector.        Worries about rising bad debts overshadowed news of record earnings at Bank of America, prompting what analysts described as long overdue profit-taking.        Investors appeared to shrug off roaring profits from government-rescued Bank of America -- the latest in a line of encouraging corporate results from US banks including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs.        Some analysts warned that markets have further to fall before the current correction ends.        "The rally in risky assets, in particular stocks, since early March has been excessive and only partially justified by fundamentals," said Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief investment strategist at SJS Markets in Hong Kong.        US and European banks are still in a mess, he added.        "Concerns over systemic stability are likely to reemerge, which should drag down the entire market," Kowalczyk said.        Many analysts said markets were ripe for a pullback. The Dow Jones index had risen 22.7 per cent over the past six weeks, the best performance over a similar period since 1938.        "We are witnessing an appropriate degree of reality. While the pace of global economic contraction is slowing, the fact of contraction appeared to have been ignored," said Societe Generale analyst Patrick Bennett.        Investors brushed aside news that Bank of America recorded a profit of 4.2 billion US dollars in the first quarter as the results were boosted by one-time gains.        Instead the market was spooked by its warnings of weaker loan performance and its boosting of reserves for bad loans, analysts said.        Economic worries in Asia were amplified by a warning from the head of Australia's central bank that the country was probably already in recession.        "I think the reasonable person, looking at all the information available now, would come to the conclusion that the Australian economy, too, is in recession," Reserve Bank of Australia governor Glenn Stevens said.        In India the central bank lowered interest rates by 25 basis points in an effort to arrest a slowdown in Asia's third largest economy.        The Asian Development Bank said that the resilience of emerging economies in Asia should help the recovery of its stock, bond and currency markets but a turnaround would be neither quick nor easy.        "Emerging Asia's financial markets were hit harder than expected last year. But given that many emerging Asian economies will still grow this year while major global economies contract, Asia's financial markets should do better than most other regions," the ADB said.        - AFP/ir
