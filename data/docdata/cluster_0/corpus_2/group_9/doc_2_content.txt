    New York Times       April 22, 2009         Markets Fall in Asia and Turn Lower in Europe       By   DAVID JOLLY   and BETTINA   WASSENER         PARIS - Asian markets fell Tuesday amid lingering concerns about global banks while Europe exchanges gave up early gains. Wall Street appeared headed for   lower opening.      At afternoon trading, the   Dow Jones   Euro   Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, was down 2 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London had declined 1.7. The CAC 40 in Paris dropped 1.6   percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt was down 1.4 percent. European   stocks   fell about 3.6   percent Monday.      Trading in index futures suggested Wall Street stocks would decline s when trading begins. On Monday, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index tumbled 4.3   percent after   Bank of   America   fell 24 percent, leading financial shares down.      The bank reported a $4.2 billion first-quarter profit, but investors remain concerned that banks face more credit losses, write-downs and the need to   raise additional capital. Analysts also worry that many of the profits being reported by banks this quarter have come from one-time gains or accounting   adjustments.      In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slipped nearly 3 percent, and the Shanghai Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.9 percent. The Tokyo benchmark Nikkei   225 stock average shed 2.4 percent, and the S&amp;P/ASX 200 in Sydney lost 2.4 percent.      Shares in Japan's major banks fell Tuesday, with Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group finishing 1.7 percent lower,   Mizuho Financial   Group   falling 2 percent and   Mitsubishi UFJ   Financial Group   declining 1 percent.      Technology companies like Canon, NEC Electronics and   Hitachi   were also dragged   lower by a larger-than-expected decline in quarterly sales at   I.B.M.  ,   which is seen as a bellwether for technology spending by corporations.      Many analysts and market watchers have cautioned that the rally seen around the world since early March - set off mainly by signs that the pace of   economic deterioration has slowed - has been excessive and only partly justified by fundamentals.      "We are witnessing an appropriate degree of reality. While the pace of global economic contraction is slowing, the fact of contraction appeared to   have been ignored," Patrick Bennett, an analyst at   Socit Gnrale   in Hong   Kong, said in a note.      "One day of a major correction does not break a trend, especially the ferocious rally of the past six weeks," said Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief   investment strategist, CFC Seymour in Hong Kong. "But we do expect a more substantial return to the risk aversion trade some time in the near term, most   likely in relation to the U.S. bank stress test results expected on May 4."      Across Asia, the focus is now shifting to earnings from corporate giants including   Toyota   and   Hyundai, and electronics companies like Samsung,   Sony  , Hitachi and   Toshiba, all of which are due to report in the next few weeks.      LG Electronics, the South Korean manufacturer of mobile phones and LCD televisions, on Tuesday reported a first-quarter net loss of 197.6 billion won   ($146 million), down from a profit of 422.2 billion won a year earlier. But operating profits beat expectations as market share rose, helped in part by the   weak won, which makes its products cheaper for customers abroad.      LG's shares rose 1 percent, while the Kospi index in Seoul bucked the regional trend to finish flat.      Toshiba, the largest Japanese maker of semiconductor chips, highlighted the tough conditions that continue to haunt the company and its industry peers,   when it indicated last Friday that its net loss for the business year that ended March 31 would be 350 billion, or $3.5 billion, rather than the 280   billion it had earlier projected.      Toshiba also said it would cut 3,900 contract workers in Japan by next March, an example of how job losses in the word's second-largest economy are   continuing to rise as the recession there drags on.      Meanwhile, India's central bank on Tuesday lower its key interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, highlighting how even one of the   region's most resilient economies is being dragged down by the global slump. The central bank also lowered its economic growth estimate for the year that   ends March 2010 to 6 percent.      Crude oil futures for May delivery fell 31 cents to $45.57 a barrel. Comex gold rose $3.30 to $890.30 an ounce.      The dollar was mixed against other major currencies. The euro rose to $1.2947 from $1.2921 late Monday in New York, while the British pound rose $1.4565   to $1.4539. The dollar rose to 98.17 yen from 97.89 and to 1.1699 Swiss francs from 1.1688.      Bond prices were broadly stable, with the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year   Treasury     note at 2.83 percent.            David Jolly reported from Paris, and Bettina Wassener from Hong Kong.
