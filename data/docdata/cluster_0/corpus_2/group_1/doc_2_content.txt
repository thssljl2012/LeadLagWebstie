LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Sterling skidded to its lowest in nearly 12 years on a trade-weighted basis on Friday, falling against the dollar and euro after a report showed Britain&amp;#039;s economy unexpectedly stalled in the second quarter.    Investors dumped the pound when a gross domestic product (GDP) reading was revised to show it was unchanged in the three months to June from an initial estimate of 0.2 percent quarterly growth. Analysts had forecast a revision to 0.1 percent growth.    That was the economy&amp;#039;s worst quarterly performance since the second quarter of 1992 when it was in the throes of its last recession.    &amp;#039;Today&amp;#039;s data increases the chance of a recession in the UK, so that&amp;#039;s why sterling is under considerable pressure and that&amp;#039;s why we think sterling will remain under pressure,&amp;#039; said Antje Praefcke, currency strategist at Commerzbank.    At 1418 GMT, the pound  was down 1.1 percent on the day at $1.8586, having earlier plumbed a low of $1.8550. The euro climbed 0.5 percent to 79.69 pence after hitting a one-week high of 79.88 pence .    On a trade-weighted basis, the pound  dropped to 90.60, a level last seen in late 1996.    Stop-loss selling and other technical factors probably contributed to sterling&amp;#039;s steep slide, according to traders, who noted the reaction in short sterling interest rate futures  was far more subdued.    While a short-term rebound may be on the cards, analysts believe the pound will extend its slide in the months ahead.    &amp;#039;We think the flow of news is going to continue to be negative for sterling,&amp;#039; said Adarsh Sinha, currency strategist at Barclays Capital, which is expecting the euro to rise to 82 pence over the next three months.    &amp;#039;The market will have to price in the risk of a rate cut sooner rather than later and more rate cuts than it has priced in right now. Our central view is the first cut will occur in November.&amp;#039;    Markets have priced in about a 60 percent chance of a 25 basis point cut to the Bank of England&amp;#039;s 5.0 percent benchmark rate by November.    &amp;#039;We had expected for some time that the BoE would cut the Bank Rate to 4.0 percent by Q3 2009. We now add a further cumulative 50 basis points of easing to take rates down to 3.50 percent by end-2009,&amp;#039; said Matthew Sharratt, an economist at Bank of America.
