SYDNEY, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar fell towards last week&amp;#039;s seven-month lows on Tuesday, dragged down by a fresh bout of risk aversion and caution ahead of the release of the minutes from the central bank&amp;#039;s latest board meeting.    * The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will release the minutes of its Aug. 5 board meeting at 11:30 a.m. (0130 GMT). It kept rates unchanged at a 12-year high of 7.25 percent at the meeting, but signalled the next move was likely to be lower.    * Last week, RBA Deputy Governor Ric Battellino said the RBA would not wait for inflation to fall before easing policy, backing expectations of a deep rate cut in September.    * Rate futures  are pricing in an even chance of a 50 basis point cut next month, the first in seven years, as the central bank grapples with rapidly cooling demand.    * By 9:20 a.m. the Aussie  was at $0.8675/80 against the U.S. dollar, down from $0.8733/34 late here on Monday and not far from a seven-month low of $0.8590 struck last Wednesday.    * The Aussie has shed nearly 13 percent since it struck a 25-year high of $0.9851 against the U.S. dollar on July 15 amid declining commodity prices and expectations of steep domestic rate cuts in the coming months.    * The Aussie fell to 95.54 yen  from 96.19 yen late here on Monday as a drop in appetite for risk led investors to pare holdings in stocks and high-yielding currencies.    * Stocks, especially financial sector shares, fell on Monday after Barrons reported that the U.S. Treasury might have to bail out home finance giants Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac . The Treasury Department said it had no plans to use its authority to backstop either of the two companies.    * Commodities were mixed with oil and metal prices falling but grains and gold advancing. The CRB commodities index  was up 0.54 percent on Monday, paring some of last week&amp;#039;s steep losses. Australia is a big exporter of commodities.    * Australian bonds were higher, boosted by safe-haven inflows and expectations of future interest rate cuts by the RBA. Three-year bond futures  were indicated up 0.015 points at 94.340, while the 10-year bond contract  was up by 0.005 points to 94.230.
