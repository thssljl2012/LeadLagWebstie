Contango implies commercial inventory to build up on stockpiling New record prices obliterate not only nominal highs but inflation-adjusted highs of $100-111/b reached in 1981 (when Iran cut exports)  Outlook: UBS: July slide just a bump in the road towards higher crude prices TD: Oil to retreat to $100 early 2009, before strengthening gradually later next year NBF: As demand growth falls behind supply growth, oil to slide to $80/b by end-2009 Deutsche Bank (not online), Lehman (via BIME): Back in the double digits, forward prices had already reached point at which new supplies can be triggered. In triple-digits, the market is at point where higher prices won&amp;#039;t generate more supply. For every US$100 million in new inflows, WTI prices increase by 1.6% IEA: Despite some slowing, demand may still exceed supply. Fundamentals underpin high oil prices Upside risks: lack of surplus (or spare) capacity, low inventories, reserve depletion, higher cost of production (due to labor shortages, credit crisis, extraction from unconventional sources), growing demand supported by fuel subsidies, US$ weakness, speculation, hedging, low interest rates, shortage of investment in developing new oil fields and expanding or maintaining refineries and pipelines, resource protectionism Spike risks: weather, geopolitics, revision in large traders&amp;#039; forecasts Downside risks: recession bets, end of refinery maintenance, high inventories, Saudi output hike, fuel subsidy cuts, increased non-OPEC supply and refinery capacity, regulation Consensus estimate for avg WTI price in 2008 raised from $76/b to $117/b (BNP: $124; Barclays: $116.90; UniCredit, UBS $116; Standard Chartered $114; EIA: $110; Goldman Sachs: $108; Danske $83.5; Natixis $67.7). Goldman Sachs raised forecast for H208 avg oil price to $141 from $107 due to fundamentals and resource protectionism by oil producers. Boone Pickens predicts $150 Fed: Absent supply disruptions, it will be difficult to sustain oil prices above $100 (in 2008 dollars) over next 10 years Barclays: Long-term market balancing average to be at $137/b in 2015   Roubini Global Econmics Outlokk
