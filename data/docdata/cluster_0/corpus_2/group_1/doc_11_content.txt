 ANZ has cut its fixed mortgage interest rates by up to half a percentage point. The bank said today that rates for fixed rate home loans and residential investment loans will fall across all terms by between 11 basis points and 50 basis points.       &amp;amp;quot;These changes will enable ANZ to offer our customers some very competitive fixed rates,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; it said.       The new rates apply from next Monday.      Its one year fixed rate will fall by 11 basis points to 8.99 per cent, per annum. Its seven year fixed rate will fall by 50 basis points, also to 8.99 per cent.       The decision by ANZ to cut its fixed rates - but not its variable rates - comes as financial markets factor in a likely cut in official interest rates next month.       Earlier today, ANZ managing director for mortgages Michael Rowland today a federal parliamentary committee hearing in Melbourne that there was no certainty the bank would pass on in full any cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia.       &amp;amp;quot;We would like to cut those interest rates but we will have to assess what is happening to our funding costs at that time,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Mr Rowland told the committee.       The House of Representatives Economics Committee is examining whether competition in the financial sector has been reduced following the global credit crunch.
