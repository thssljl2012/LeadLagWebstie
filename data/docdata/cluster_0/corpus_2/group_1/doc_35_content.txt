SYDNEY, Aug 27 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar held above 11-month lows against the U.S. currency on Wednesday, aided by a recovery in commodities and stocks, but was likely to stay subdued amid deepening worries about a global economic slowdown.    * Those concerns increased after gloomy eurozone economic data which raised the prospects of a recession there. The Ifo German business climate index in August fell more than expected while German GDP shrank in the second quarter for the first time since 2004 [nLQ153338].    * Australia is also grappling with a slowdown. Rate futures  are pricing in a 25 basis point cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) early next month to cushion the economy.    * Domestic data in the coming days will shed more light on the economy. On Wednesday, second-quarter construction work data will be released and analysts are forecasting a 1.5 percent rise over the previous quarter.    * By 9:35 a.m. (2335 GMT), the Aussie dollar  was at $0.8550/52 against the U.S. dollar, down from $0.8570/72 late here on Tuesday, but higher than the $0.8493 struck offshore, its lowest since Sept. 19, 2007.    * Offering some support to the Aussie was higher commodities prices. The CRB commodities index  rose 0.76 percent, led by oil prices which rose 1 percent on Tuesday. Australia is a big exporter of resources.    * Investors remained worried about the financial sector after the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) said more banks could be facing problems due to the credit crunch. The FDIC&amp;#039;s list of troubled U.S. banks rose to 117 in the second quarter from 90 in the first.    * The Aussie inched up from a offshore low of 93.26 yen  to 93.70 yen on Wednesday helped by higher stock markets, but was unlikely to go far on lingering financial sector worries and expectations of an Australian rate cut next month which would diminish the allure of high-yielding Australian assets.    * Australian bonds were lower as safe-haven inflows took a breather, but were supported by expectations that the ructions in the financial sector and the credit crunch would only hasten the need to lower domestic rates.    * Three-year bond futures  fell 0.01 points to 94.38, while the 10-year bond contract  eased by 0.005 points 94.275.
