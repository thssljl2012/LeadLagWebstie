SYDNEY, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar fell towards seven-month lows against a buoyant U.S. currency on Friday, weighed down by falling commodity prices and expectations of a steep domestic interest rate cut next month.    Investors continued to unwind long commodity and short U.S. dollar bets aggressively, boosting the U.S. currency to six-month peaks against the euro .    Gold  dived to its lowest since December, with oil and metal prices also selling off amid growing concerns about a global economic slowdown.    Data from New Zealand showed retail sales fell at a record pace in the second quarter, backing views the economy there is in recession [nWEL313103]. The report came a day after data showed the euro zone economy recorded its first ever contraction in the second quarter.    Those worries drove the Aussie  to as low as $0.8625 against the U.S. dollar, not far from a seven-month low of $0.8590 struck on Wednesday, with investors pricing in a better-than-even chance of a 50 basis point rate cut next month.    By 4:10 p.m. (0610 GMT), the Aussie was at $0.8631/36, down from $0.8702/07 late here on Thursday and nearly 14 percent off its 25-year high of $0.9851 struck on July 15.    &amp;#039;The fall in gold and metal prices are conspiring, with expectations of lower interest rates, to drive the Aussie lower,&amp;#039; said Stephen Roberts, chief economist at Lehman Brothers.    &amp;#039;The overhang of the sell-off by Japanese retail investors is also weighing down and that could see the Aussie fall to $0.8500 in the next few weeks.&amp;#039;    The Aussie was subdued against the yen , holding just above recent four-month lows, amid fears Japanese investors will continue to unwind leveraged carry trades on the back of growing expectations of rate cuts in Australia.    &amp;#039;The downward correction in the Aussie/yen cross was driven by forced liquidation of long positions by Japanese retail investors, possibly related to margin calls,&amp;#039; said Sue Trinh, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets.    Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Deputy Governor Ric Battellino gave the strongest signal yet that a rate cut was coming in September when he said authorities would not wait for inflation to fall before easing policy.    Whether the RBA will cut by 25 or 50 basis points next month could become clearer next Tuesday when the bank releases the minutes of its last board meeting held on Aug. 4.    At that meeting, the central bank kept rates unchanged at a 12-year high of 7.25 percent, but signalled that the next move was likely to be lower.    Australian bonds nudged higher, supported by rate cut expectations. Three-year bond futures  were up 0.015 points at 94.29, while the 10-year bond contract  was up by 0.02 points to 94.155.
