TOKYO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a seven-week high against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday, drawing support from a sharp drop in oil prices that also hit the Australian dollar.    The Aussie dropped to a four-month low against the U.S. unit ahead of an interest rate verdict by the Australian central bank at 0430 GMT.    Traders said the Aussie was vulnerable as speculation is rampant that the Reserve Bank of Australia could highlight growing risks to the economy and open the door to monetary easing in the next few months.    A Reuters poll of 21 economists on Friday found none expected a cut in the 7.25 percent cash rate this week, but did see a 30 percent chance of a move in September. [ID:nSYD254758]    &amp;#039;The Aussie is likely to continue falling if the market finds any policy switch by the RBA regarding monetary easing,&amp;#039; said a trader at a Japanese trust bank.    The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency&amp;#039;s performance against a basket of six currencies, rose 0.2 percent to 73.642  and reached as high as 73.673, the highest since mid-June.    Investors also braced for the Federal Reserve&amp;#039;s policy decision later in the day with the focus on the central bank&amp;#039;s post-meeting statement for clues on the monetary policy outlook.    &amp;#039;The key to the impact on the market is how the Fed&amp;#039;s statement will change expectations for a monetary tightening outlook,&amp;#039; said analysts at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Tokyo in a note to clients.    Some upbeat U.S. economic data on Monday generated optimism about the prospects for the broader economy while unexpected surges in consumer prices raised the possibility of higher interest rates by the end of the year.    The Fed is widely expected to keep benchmark interest rates steady at 2.0 percent in the face of higher risks of inflation and threats to economic growth.    The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.5532 , a tad above a six-week low around $1.5510 hit last week as investors awaited more central bank meetings later this week including the Bank of England and European Central Bank.    The dollar&amp;#039;s performance against the euro has been closely correlated to the direction of oil prices, with cheaper oil generally supporting the U.S. currency.    U.S. crude oil futures  fell more than $1 to trade near a three-month low of $119.50 hit the previous day.    Against the yen, the euro dropped 0.3 percent to 168.10 yen .    The dollar was steady at 108.20 yen , in sight of a six-week high of 108.39 yen hit last week.    The Aussie fell 0.2 percent to $0.9273  after sliding as low as $0.9262, its lowest level since mid-April, as hedge funds continued to liquidate long positions, traders said.
