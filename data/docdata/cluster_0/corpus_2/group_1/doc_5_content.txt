 ROY Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              From the WSJ on nickel    I believe nickel&amp;#039;s slide is over but I&amp;#039;ve ALWAYS been too optomistic. Nickel is up today last I looked more then 5%..........Mike    &amp;amp;nbsp;                                         Nickel&amp;#039;s slide may go on - WSJ                                                        WSJ reports&amp;amp;nbsp;a slump in nickel prices of more than 30% this year, combined with rising costs, has forced several operations to shut down or scale back output -- but that might not be enough to put a floor on prices. Producers of nickel, as well as zinc, are most at risk of becoming uneconomical because of a double whammy from massive price retreats and higher costs... &amp;quot;If more pipeline projects are shelved, we expect that this would also create a potential upside risk to prices in 2009,&amp;quot; Barclays Capital analysts said in a research note. Others aren&amp;#039;t so sure. &amp;quot;Nickel prices need to fall an awful long way to set a floor. One or two closures aren&amp;#039;t enough,&amp;quot; said Alan Heap, a commodities analyst at Citigroup. He pegs the nickel surplus this year at 90,000 metric tons and says prices could fall to as low as $13,225 a metric ton... Despite the lower prices, demand from the stainless-steel industry, the main consumer of the anticorrosive metal, hasn&amp;#039;t picked up. Instead, consumers appear to be hoping for even lower prices. Nickel producers are being squeezed by energy prices and the rising costs of sulfuric acid, a key component to extract nickel laterite ores. Sulfur prices have rocketed from an average of just more than $100 a ton last year to more than $800 a ton.
