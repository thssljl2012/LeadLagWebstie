            as usual, Bush&amp;#039;s people are ahead of everybody in the world in handling financial crisis.       http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/46500de6-6...0779fd18c.html            Quote:                         They say other central banks, unlike the Federal Reserve, have been slow to respond to a potential slowdown, refusing to cut interest rates as they focus on fighting inflation.      However, Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, warned of a slowdown in the eurozone in the coming months, quashing expectations of higher interest rates.       The trend is expected to be confirmed by data from Germany this week, which is forecast to show that growth contracted in the second quarter.      Japanese officials have warned that the economy is heading for recession, while UK data continue to deteriorate and the Reserve Bank of Australia has said it is set to cut interest rates.      Ulrich Leuchtmann at Commerzbank said in a note he expected the dollar to rise like a phoenix. He said low US interest rates were not a burden on the dollar but an attraction, proof that the Federal Reserve was able to react quicker to turmoil than other central banks.      He said that in a very short period, sentiment turned by 180 degrees  the market now believes that the US economy once again will be able to leave a crisis behind very quickly.                                                                                                        __________________       I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend till my death your right to say it.                                                                                                                                                                                  mumbles               View Public Profile                Send a private message to mumbles                      Find all posts by mumbles   ...
