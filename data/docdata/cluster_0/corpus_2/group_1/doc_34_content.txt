ENERGY MATTERS: Puzzling Out China&amp;#039;s Post-Olympics Oil Mkt         NEW YORK (Dow Jones)- -As the Games begin, let the guessing games begin . For competitors and sports fans, the Beijing Olympic games will be a memory when the closing ceremonies end Aug. 24. For oil markets, the Olympic-size task of puzzling out Chinese oil demand, and its huge impact on the world market, will begin anew.     Ahead of the Olympics, which officially opened Friday,  China stockpiled oil products , shut some factories and banned perhaps as many as 1 million cars from the roads in an attempt to curb pollution. How demand shakes out in the world&amp;#039;s second-biggest oil consumer once the Olympic torch is passed will be vital to setting the course for near-term oil prices.     Less than a month ago, Nymex crude oil futures set a record at $147.27 a barrel, but signs of slumping demand in the U.S., the world&amp;#039;s biggest oil consumer, knocked prices Friday to a low of $115, a 22%, or $32-a-barrel drop from the peak.     U.S. oil demand in the first seven months of the year is down 750,000 barrels a day from a year earlier, at just under 20 million barrels a day, if preliminary June and July data from the Energy Information Administration holds up to later revisions. The 750,000-barrel-a-day drop would be the biggest in the January-July period since 1982.     The steep drop presents about a 1-million-barrel-a-day swing in U.S. demand from EIA projections at the start of the year for demand growth of 1.1%, or 230,000 barrels a day. But oil prices, now expected to average $40 above the January forecast for this year of $87 a barrel, rewrote the script.        US Drop More Than Covers China Rise        The drop-off in U.S. demand will far exceed the growth in China&amp;#039;s demand, expected to be on the order of 400,000 barrels a day this year, or about one third of the global oil demand rise. Analysts said there&amp;#039;s a high risk of misreading signals from Chinese oil demand, as market moves often defy what conventional economics would argue.        China&amp;#039;s surprise 17% to 18% increases in domestic gasoline and diesel prices in June likely had the counterintuitive impact of boosting demand for the products, not cutting it.  That&amp;#039;s because the higher prices gave some refiners the incentives to boost output that had been constrained by weak margins caused by low selling prices and high crude oil prices.     The low refinery supplies had caused shortfalls in supply, leaving pent-up demand that was met as the price rise led to greater supplies. Now analysts weigh the impact of potentially inflated pre-Olympics oil stockpiling on demand data with guesses of how the picture will change after the games conclude.     &amp;quot; There is little doubt that the pre-Olympic surge in Chinese oil imports and apparent demand was a one-off ,&amp;quot; said Antoine Halff, an analyst at Newedge USA LLC. &amp;quot;Actual demand will likely lose steam during the Games themselves, due to measures to rein in pollution.     The precautionary stock build that preceded the Games was essentially borrowed demand, leading to an offsetting slowdown post-Games.&amp;quot; Asian demand in general is likely to show &amp;quot;significantly slower growth in the fourth quarter&amp;quot; even as new refinery units come on line in India and China, Halff said.     &amp;quot; With relief coming from both the supply and demand side, &amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;Asian products balances will get somewhat sloppy and we should expect significant dumping of Asian products into the U.S. West Coast.&amp;quot; Ultimate revisions of opaque data could be striking.     Independent analyst and China specialist Paul Ting said he believes China&amp;#039;s oil demand grew by 6.5% in June, less than the 7.1% figurehe had earlier projected, in part because gasoline and diesel inventories climbed to record levels.        More Growth In 2nd Half        Even so, June demand was near 8.4 million barrels a day, he estimates, a stunning level given that the International Energy Agency sees quarterly Chinese demand just a tad above 8 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter, which would be the strongest-ever quarterly rate.     Ting said first-half demand in China is running at a rate of 6% (compared with 5% projected by IEA), and for now, he&amp;#039;s keeping a 5.5% annual demand-growth forecast.     Jan Stuart, oil economist at UBS Securities, defies the conventional wisdom that argues that essentially the lights are going out in China once the Olympics end. &amp;quot;We project higher growth as macro (economic) policy becomes more accommodative, not more restrictive,&amp;quot; he said.     &amp;quot; Policy messages have begun to play down worries about inflation and play up concerns about economic growth slowing ,&amp;quot; said Stuart. &amp;quot;Already, at the margin, several centrally directed credit measures are being loosened.&amp;quot; Analysts at Barclays Capital in London cautioned that post-Olympics &amp;quot; demand concerns should not be overdone .&amp;quot;     While inventories have been built up sharply in recent months, they are in line with demand growth and are &amp;quot; unlikely to represent a significant overhang on the market - especially when approximately 1 million vehicles return to the roads after the games .&amp;quot;             thread start
