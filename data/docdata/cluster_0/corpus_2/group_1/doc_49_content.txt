 Just presenting other views.             07/08/2008       1200 [Dow Jones] Australian jobs data appear &amp;amp;quot;a little bit out of whack&amp;amp;quot;, given broader softening trend in employment, says Commonwealth Bank of Australia senior economist John Peters; adds numbers reflect fact there&amp;#039;s still steam in economy, which &amp;amp;quot;far from falling off a cliff&amp;amp;quot;. Says while economy slowing according to RBA&amp;#039;s settings, &amp;amp;quot;this talk of recession is way overdone by some in the media&amp;amp;quot;.(SRH)       1221 [Dow Jones] Very recent bearish streak on Australian economy has likely gone too far, Citigroup Director of Economic Research Stephen Halmarick says. Notes while decline in New South Wales jobs is big, strength in Queensland, West Australian labor markets highlights persistent strength in resource rich part of Australian economy. &amp;amp;quot;Maybe the RBA&amp;#039;s patience on all this is probably the right strategy.&amp;amp;quot; Takes edge off calls for 50bp RBA cut in September. &amp;amp;quot;I suspect some of the extreme bearishness about the Australian economy that has developed over the last week or two may have gone a little bit too far.&amp;amp;quot; But adds stronger-than-expected Australian jobs data need to be taken with &amp;amp;quot;grain of salt&amp;amp;quot;, given reduction to sampling size of survey.(SRH)      1223 [Dow Jones] Australian June jobs data show labor market &amp;amp;quot;easing glacially&amp;amp;quot; but likely to incur significant weakness through 2H, says UBS Chief Economist Scott Haslem. Yet data still shows economy reasonably resilient with export income likely to provide some cushion; coupled with rising inflation, means RBA easing cycle will be cautious.(EGC)
