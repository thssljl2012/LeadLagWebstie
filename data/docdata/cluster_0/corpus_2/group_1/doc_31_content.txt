  AUDUSD looks oversold       Techically AUDUSD looks oversold based on stochastics, with good support at around 0.9300.       Short term chart shows that AUDUSD is picking up from a base of 0.9280.      Market expects Reserve Bank of Australia to keep its benchmarket rate at 7.25% tomorrow. I predict RBA to keep interest rate the same. So I expect AUDUSD to move higher after the announcement.      Bought 20,000 AUDUSD at 0.9334   Stop level at 0.9260    Target level at 0.9450       Chart:  Forex and Binary Trading: AUDUSD looks oversold
