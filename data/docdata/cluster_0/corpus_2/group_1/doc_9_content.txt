I think you skipped bits of the article:    ``We still see the balance of risks to the upside for euro- dollar given considerable headwinds facing the dollar and unrealistic pricing for Fed hikes,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; strategists led by   Ray Farris   at Credit Suisse Group in London wrote in a research note at the end of last week. The dollar may decline to $1.61 per euro by the end of next month and to $1.64 by year-end, they said, the most bearish forecast in the Bloomberg survey.       David Woo  , head of currency strategy in London at Barclays, disagrees. ``The euro-dollar market is in an overshoot territory,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said. Barclays, the world&amp;#039;s third largest currency trader, according to an annual survey by Euromoney magazine, expects the dollar to weaken to $1.57 per euro by year-end.
