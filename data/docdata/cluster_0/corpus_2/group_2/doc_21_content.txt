       Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson&amp;#039;s plan to end the rout in U.S. financial markets may derail the dollar&amp;#039;s three-month rally as investors weigh the costs of the rescue.  The combination of spending $700 billion on soured mortgage-related assets and providing $400 billion to guarantee money-market mutual funds will boost U.S. borrowing as much as $1 trillion, according to Barclays Capital interest-rate strategist Michael Pond in New York. While the rescue may restore investor confidence to battered financial markets, traders will again focus on the twin budget and current-account deficits and negative real U.S. interest rates.  ``As we get to the other side of this, the dollar will get crushed,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said John Taylor, chairman of New York-based International Foreign Exchange Concepts Inc., the world&amp;#039;s biggest currency hedge-fund firm, which manages about $15 billion.    http://bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;amp;sid=arSYa87HCb9U&amp;amp;amp;
