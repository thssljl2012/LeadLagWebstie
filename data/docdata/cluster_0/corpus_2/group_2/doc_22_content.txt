Barclays Says Commodities to Revive After Worst Drop Since 1956      By Thomas Kutty Abraham      Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Commodities, set for the biggest quarterly  loss in at least five decades, may rebound on demand for food and  industrial materials from nations including India and China,  according to Barclays Capital.      The tumble since July is a temporary reversal in a long-term rally,  Paul Horsnell, head of commodities research at Barclays Capital in  London, said in Mumbai today.      Crude oil, soybeans, copper and platinum have dropped from all-time  highs after a rally in the U.S. dollar curbed demand for raw  materials as a hedge against inflation and concerns increased that  economic growth will slow. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19  commodities has slumped by a fifth since June 30 and is headed for  the biggest quarterly loss since at least 1956.      ``At this point commodities are in a normal correction stage rather  than any change in major dynamics of demand&amp;#039;&amp;#039; from nations  including China and India, Horsnell said.      While the turmoil in global financial markets has increased  volatility in commodities, there hasn&amp;#039;t been a ``great outflow of  money&amp;#039;&amp;#039; from commodity markets, he said.      Crude oil may average $115 a barrel next year, extending a six-year  rally, Horsnell said. Barclays cut its fourth-quarter oil price  forecast 21 percent to $97.50 a barrel on Sept. 11 on weakening  demand for fuels. Crude has fallen 28 percent since touching a  record $147.27 a barrel on July 11.      Metals Affected      While zinc may extend this year&amp;#039;s 24 percent drop, lead may not see  a ``sharp&amp;#039;&amp;#039; increase, Horsnell said. Prices of copper may stay  stable and nickel, the worst among the six industrial metals traded  on the London Metal Exchange, may not extend losses.      ``At this stage, metals are affected by the overall global macro  economic sentiments, though they probably don&amp;#039;t have poor  fundamentals to match that, except in the case of zinc,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he  said.      Among agricultural commodities, cotton, corn and soybean may gain  the most over the next year, while wheat may fall because of higher  production globally, he said.      Gold, which has risen 8 percent this month as investors seek a  haven from financial turmoil, probably won&amp;#039;t touch the March 17  record of $1,032.70 an ounce again this year, he said.
