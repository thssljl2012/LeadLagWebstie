 MLPs Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 6              Barclays (formerly Lehman) on NRP         Natural Resource Partners, LP     (NRP - US$ 25.70) 1-Overweight         Initiation of Coverage        Initiating Coverage at 1-OW and $46 PT             &amp;amp;nbsp;    Investment Conclusion        In our opinion, Natural Resource Partners&amp;#039; current valuation reflects overly negative market sentiment regarding the prospects for natural resource and mining stocks. While some concerns regarding slower global growth are understandable, we believe that the fundamentals for the coal sector are and will remain strong, leading to impressive margins and strong cash flow generation. We view NRP as one of our favorite names in the coal MLP sector given its leverage to the metallurgical coal market via lessee coal production and the growth potential of its Illinois Basin reserves.           Summary           &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56457;     We are initiating coverage on Natural Resource Partners, LP with a 1-Overweight rating and a $46 price target, which assumes a 5.2% yield on our 2009 distribution estimate of $2.40/unit. This is in line with our previous rating and price target at Lehman Brothers.          &amp;amp;#56256;&amp;amp;#56457;     Our sector outlook remains Positive based on growing global demand, which has led to increased US coal exports and strong contract pricing.       &amp;amp;nbsp;
