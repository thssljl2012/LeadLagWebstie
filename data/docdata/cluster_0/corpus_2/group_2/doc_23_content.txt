LONDON , Sept 4 (Reuters) - Copper climbed more than 1    percent to its highest level in almost a week on Thursday, as    bargain hunters lifted the metal as the dollar trimmed its gains    against the euro.    A sharp rise in cancelled warrants -- material earmarked for    delivery -- boosted tin prices, while zinc and lead gained    around 3 percent, bouncing back from recent lows.    Copper for three-months delivery  on the London Metal    Exchange rose as high as $7,440 per tonne and was at    $7,409/7,419 per tonne versus Wednesday&amp;#039;s close of $7,345.    &amp;#039;What you&amp;#039;re seeing this morning is a bounce from recent    weakness,&amp;#039; said analyst Sudakshina Unnikrishnan at Barclays    Capital. &amp;#039;Prices are just finding their feet.&amp;#039;    Earlier in the week copper fell to $7,128 per tonne, nearing    its six-month low and bringing the total losses to 7 percent    since the beginning of last week.    &amp;#039;This is a reaction to the aggressive selling recently.    People got a little bit of short and now they are covering their    positions,&amp;#039; an LME trader said.    Several traders said the dollar falling and oil firming    above $110 a barrel also helped. The U.S. currency slipped    across the board as traders locked in profits from its dramatic    gains in past weeks, while investors awaited interest rate    decisions by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.    The LME trader said copper&amp;#039;s gains would be capped as    worries about global economic growth and Chinese demand, key for    metal prices, still haunt investors.    &amp;#039;I think the sentiment still remains pretty vulnerable,&amp;#039;    said Unnikrishnan at Barclays. &amp;#039;The concerns still remain on    board about how the global economy is developing. Concerns about    the slowdown and how that links back to demand are pretty much    in place.&amp;#039;    The recent rises in copper inventories are a sign of still    sluggish demand. Currently stocks of copper, mainly used in    construction, stand around 182,000 tonnes - its highest since    January.    &amp;#039;There are still grey clouds over the United States and    Europe,&amp;#039; Gerard Burg, an analyst at the National Australia Bank,    said.    &amp;#039;The trend for metals is down. The global economy is looking    softer than in some years and supply is moving into surplus for    some of these metals,&amp;#039; Burg said.    Aluminium  gained $13.5 to $2,689/2,699 per tonne.    Several analysts cite structural power problems in China as    likely to lead to a tighter aluminium market. However stocks are    around 1.17 million tonnes -- the highest since April 2004.    Unnikrishnan at Barclays said the rise of cancelled warrants    in tin -- currently account for around 17 percent of the total    stocks at 5,820 tonnes, supported the price.    Lead  gained $39 to $1,989/1,999 per tonne while zinc     was at $1,819/1,829 versus Wednesday&amp;#039;s last quote of    $1,787.5/1,788 and nickel  was at $19,725 from    $19,550/19,600.
