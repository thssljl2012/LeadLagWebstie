          China accuses US of financial WMD   http://www.prisonplanet.com/china-accuses-us-of-financial-wmd.html   Press TV  Thursday, Sept 18, 2008  Chinese state media has blamed the US for unleashing financial &amp;amp;#8220;weapons of mass destruction&amp;amp;#8221; and sparking a global market &amp;amp;#8220;tsunami&amp;amp;#8221;.  China&amp;amp;#8217;s official People&amp;amp;#8217;s Daily warned on Wednesday that the US had set off a &amp;amp;#8220;financial tsunami&amp;amp;#8221; by allowing Wall Street lenders to trade in subprime debts and unstable financial derivatives.  In response to market turmoil, China&amp;amp;#8217;s central bank cut interest rates for the first time in six years, from 5.85% to 5.31% signalling Beijing&amp;amp;#8217;s intent to maintain economic growth and employment.

The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional shares fell 4.1% on Thursday as traders in Hong Kong, Japan and China fled equity markets to safer investments such as gold, government bonds and currencies such as the Yen.  Thursday trading saw Japan&amp;amp;#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average falling 3.6% while the broader Topix index skidded 3.9%. Japan&amp;amp;#8217;s central bank also pumped another Y1.5 trillion into money markets to fund banks increasingly wary about lending to each other.  Hong Kong&amp;amp;#8217;s Hang Seng Index now stands at its lowest level in over two years after dropping 7.3% on Thursday and 15.2% in the previous six sessions. HSBC holdings and China Mobile, two of the biggest and most influential stocks on the Hong Kong market, lost 7.4% and 4.6% respectively.  The Shanghai Composite index in China crashed 5.8% while the Taiex in Taiwan sank 3.6%. South Korea&amp;amp;#8217;s Kospi index dropped 3.9% after hitting an 18-month low on Tuesday.  Signs of panic spread also spread to consumers with policyholders at troubled insurance giant AIG flocking to regional offices to terminate agreements despite an $85 billion US government bailout.  Asian markets have been hit hard all week after the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers and the forced discount sale of brokerage firm Merrill Lynch.
