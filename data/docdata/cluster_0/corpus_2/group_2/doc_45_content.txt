NEW YORK, Sept 2 (Reuters) - The dollar rose to a more than 10-month high against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, boosted by lower oil prices and persistent concerns about the health of major economies outside the United States.    The euro fell to a seven-month low against the dollar, sliding below $1.45 at one point. Combined with an increasingly bleak UK economic outlook, the dollar&amp;#039;s broad strength pushed sterling further below $1.78, to its lowest level since April 2006.    The theme driving financial markets on Tuesday was oil&amp;#039;s tumble to a five-month low of $105.46 per barrel  as the damage to energy infrastructure from storm Gustav was judged to be limited.

Oil futures later recovered slightly to trade at $108.96, down 5.6 percent.    &amp;#039;The decline in crude oil is probably the big catalyst for the dollar move,&amp;#039; said Stephen Malyon, senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. &amp;#039;It looks like crude oil has begun to move a little bit higher, so we might have seen the best levels for the dollar today.&amp;#039;    Malyon said the greenback also drew support from weakness in high-yielding currencies triggered by the Reserve Bank of Australia&amp;#039;s interest-rate cut.    In midday New York trading, the dollar index  rose 0.6 percent to 78.106, after earlier hitting a 10-1/2-month high of 78.310. The index has racked up gains of 10 percent since mid-July.    The euro was down 0.6 percent on the day at $1.4513 , after falling below $1.45 for the first time since February and more than 15 cents off the record high scaled in mid-July.    Sterling hit a 2-1/2-year low of $1.7784  before pulling back to $1.7814, down 1.1 percent.    The dollar was up 0.7 percent against the yen at 108.86 yen , above a one-month low of 107.63 struck the previous day, according to Reuters data.    The dollar trimmed gains after a report showed U.S. factory activity unexpectedly shrank slightly in August while inflation pressures also eased. For more details, see [ID:nN02395318].    WORRIES ABOUT GLOBAL GROWTH    Liquidity in the global foreign exchange market was returning to more normal levels as U.S. markets reopened after Monday&amp;#039;s Labor Day holiday.    The focus later this week is expected to shift to the news conference that European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet will hold after Thursday&amp;#039;s policy meeting, at which the ECB is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at 4.25 percent.    With oil prices falling sharply, investors will look for signs that Trichet&amp;#039;s anti-inflation stance is cooling. Oil has fallen almost 30 percent from July&amp;#039;s record peaks near $150.    &amp;#039;This week, we&amp;#039;re going to see a lot of U.S. economic data, but we&amp;#039;re also going to see some pretty soft economic data out of the euro zone,&amp;#039; said Andrew Busch, BMO Capital Markets&amp;#039; global FX strategist in Chicago.    Sterling was under pressure after Britain&amp;#039;s finance minister said over the weekend that economic challenges were the greatest in 60 years. Sterling on Tuesday hit a 12-year low on a trade-weighted measure at 88.3 , with the euro rising to a record high of 81.46 pence .    Earlier on Tuesday, Australia&amp;#039;s central bank cut rates by a quarter percentage point to 7 percent, helping shove the Australian dollar down to its lowest in a year. The Australian dollar last traded down 1.6 percent at US$0.8360 .    Investors were also paying close attention to Asian currencies on Tuesday, especially the South Korean won, which hit a nearly four-year low against the dollar despite official warnings of stern measures in the currency market. For more, see: [ID:nSEO84858]. The won last fell 1.3 percent at 1130.50 against the dollar.    Earlier in the global session, Asian currencies extended losses against the U.S. dollar, prompting central banks in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia to sell dollars to support their currencies.
