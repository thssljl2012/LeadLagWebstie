TOKYO, Sept 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar edged up to a one-year peak against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, riding a boost in confidence in the U.S. financial sector after the government seized control of mortgage giants Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac .    The decision by the U.S. government to bail out the lenders was widely hailed as positive step in staving off wider financial and housing market weakness.    The dollar index , a gauge of the greenback&amp;#039;s performance against a basket of six currencies, hit a fresh one-year high of 79.776 on Tuesday before pulling back to 79.550, unchanged on the day.    The euro sagged against the dollar and yen as bearish economic prospects for the euro zone once again came to fore and investor appetite for risk, which had risen on the U.S. bailout plan, looked to be on the wane again with equities taking a hit.    Asian equity markets slumped on Tuesday in a sobering realisation the bailout addressed, but did not solve, risks stemming from the financial crisis. [MKTS/GLOB]    The euro retreated 0.3 percent to $1.4093, after dipping to a fresh 11-month low of $1.4046 .    &amp;#039;The euro is edging down toward the $1.4000 threshold, and that is weighing on other currencies like the Aussie,&amp;#039; said a dealer at a Japanese brokerage.    The yen proved resilient against the Aussie and sterling.    &amp;#039;Bargain hunting interest for cross yen pairs is still out there, but investors cannot venture out while the euro is declining and equities are falling,&amp;#039; the dealer said.    The yen&amp;#039;s rebound against various currencies on Tuesday put the dollar on the back foot against the Japanese unit. The dollar fell 0.7 percent to 107.55 yen .    While positive for the greenback now, the rescue plan had not been able to fully reverse the larger trend of risk aversion, analysts said.    &amp;#039;The Fannie and Freddie takeover is an open-ended question as far as the foreign exchange market is concerned. There is still confusion,&amp;#039; said Motonari Ogawa, director of currency trading at Barclays Bank.    &amp;#039;It is difficult to embrace the takeover as a fully positive factor,&amp;#039; he said.    The euro fell 1 percent to 151.52 yen  after poking above 157.00 yen on Monday, while sterling slipped 0.8 percent to 188.77 yen  after jumping above 195.00 yen on Monday.    The Australian dollar slid 1.1 percent to $0.8062  after touching a fresh one-year low below $0.8028. It tumbled 1.6 percent to 86.71 yen .
