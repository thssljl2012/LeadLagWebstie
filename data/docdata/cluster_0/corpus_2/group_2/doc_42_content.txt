       The &amp;amp;quot;news&amp;amp;quot; could be that we finished ABC corrections off the lows and are now heading lower again. :-)  There&amp;#039;s the AIG news already posted, and there were also rumors of Barclays buying part(s) of LEH which gave us an initial spike. MS, for example, hit 32... but is now at 28.5.   Still, there is room for up in the counts, but we&amp;#039;re also in a serious band of resistance and, as I mentioned, this low seemed so easy. Still, AIG can only drop another buck and a half... and who knows what news we&amp;#039;ll have by the AM. (I mean, really -- the US is &amp;amp;quot;considering&amp;amp;quot; something with AIG. Who knows what else they&amp;#039;re &amp;amp;quot;considering&amp;amp;quot;? I&amp;#039;m sure they &amp;amp;quot;considered&amp;amp;quot; a rate cut, too!)
