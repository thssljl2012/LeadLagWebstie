Actually its not all that bad for me.       I predicted that the oil price will not stay up at $147, so I bought airlines shares beause they were down due to hi prices. The few shares that went up today were airlines. Oil went down to 95$ and will go down further. Barclays which I own shares Thanks God they withrew from buying Lehman last night.
