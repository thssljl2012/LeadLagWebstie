The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares ended unofficially with a loss of 3.7 percent at 1,119.47 points, its lowest close since July 16. Falling stocks led risers by about 10-to-one, according to Reuters data.  &amp;quot;With the financial crisis having scaled a new peak, the uncertainty among investors has increased strongly. An end to the volatility in the stock markets is not in sight,&amp;quot; Landesbank Berlin said in a note.

Index heavyweight energy stocks such as Total (TOTF.PA: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), down 5 percent and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), down 4.4 percent, were hit by a steep fall in crude oil prices CLc1 LCOc1, which analysts linked partly to U.S. financial industry woes.  &amp;quot;The price of crude oil could continue to fall because the financial crisis in the U.S. has fuelled fears of an economic slowdown across the globe, which would be negative for crude oil as an economic good,&amp;quot; Commerzbank said in a research note.  Economic growth concerns also pulled base metals prices lower, hurting shares in miners such as Rio Tinto (RIO.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), down 6.6 percent, and BHP Billiton (BLT.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), which fell 4.5 percent.   /.  http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idCALF106875...
