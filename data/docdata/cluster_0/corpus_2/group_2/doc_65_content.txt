&amp;quot;Peter D. Ward, the Lehman analyst who followed FCX, is now at  Barclays. The Barclays research report dated Sept 26 2008 states:  &amp;quot;We are initiating coverage on Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp;amp;amp; Gold  with a 1-Overweight rating and a $181 price target, which assumes a  firm value in one year of 5.2X our EBITDA estimate of $14.4  billion. This is in line with our previous rating and price target  at Lehman Brothers.&amp;quot; Further excerpt: &amp;quot;FCX remains out top pick in  North America Metals &amp;amp;amp; Mining. We continue to believe the  assets of FCX remain significantly undervalued.&amp;quot; The analyst bases  his 1-Overweight recommendation and share price target on Cu  prices/ lb. as follows: 2008E: $3.49; 2010E: $4.00; 2011E: $3.50;  2012E: $3.00. Expected Cu volumes (millions lbs.): 2008E: 4,006;  2009E: 4,466; 2010E: 4,756; 2011E: 4,531; 2012E: 4,699&amp;quot;
