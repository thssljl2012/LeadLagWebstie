         The Collapsing Russian Economy      William D. Zeranski   September 17, 2008        You don&amp;#039;t have to be an economist to see that the Russian economy is in trouble, especially when the Kremlin shuts down both of its leading stock markets:           Russian markets suspend trading after sharp falls         MOSCOW (AFP) - Russia&amp;#039;s two leading stock markets suspended trading on Wednesday as stocks continued to fall sharply amid global market turmoil.         Trading was halted on the dollar-denominated RTS on the orders of a government agency after falling 6.39 percent in the first two hours. The index has lost 57 percent since hitting an all-time high in May.         &amp;amp;quot;Trading was stopped at 12:10 pm (0810 GMT) on the orders of the Federal Service for the Financial Markets,&amp;amp;quot; an RTS spokesman said. &amp;amp;quot;We do not know when trading will resume, this is not our decision.&amp;amp;quot;         Of course, it&amp;#039;s American&amp;#039;s fault:         Analysts said the fall was due to turmoil on Wall Street in the wake of the Lehman Brothers investment bank collapse, a massive US government bailout of insurance giant AIG [. . .]          These analysts say that falling oil prices are also to blame.  But there&amp;#039;s more to it.           Russia&amp;#039;s incursion into Georgia last month has accelerated a financial downturn, creating a credit crisis that could impact Moscow&amp;#039;s increasingly muscular foreign policy.       The downturn began several months before the Aug. 8 escalation in the Caucasus and has as much to do with global trends and other political and economic developments as it does with Russia&amp;#039;s actions in Georgia, specialists here say.         The downturn begun before the Russia-Georgia War, but the conflict surely hasn&amp;#039;t helped, and probably accelerated the financial crisis.  Starting in August, &amp;amp;quot;investors have pulled funds out of Russia at the fastest rate since the country&amp;#039;s 1998 debt crisis, in the wake of the conflict with Georgia, official figures have shown.&amp;amp;quot; As reported in the Washington Times yesterday, &amp;amp;quot;The picture has clearly worsened since the fighting erupted in the Caucasus. Estimates of capital outflow in the past month range between $15 billion and $20 billion.&amp;amp;quot;         The Russia economy has been bleeding for sometime, and it appears that Vladimir Putin&amp;#039;s military venture into Georgia has only deepened Russian&amp;#039;s economic woes.                   - - - - -             View Replies   &amp;amp;raquo;
