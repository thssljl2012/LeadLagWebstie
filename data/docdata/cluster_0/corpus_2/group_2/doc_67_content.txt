Japan faces fresh economic gloom   by Miwa Suzuki   52 minutes ago         TOKYO (AFP) - Worries grew Tuesday that Japan&amp;#039;s economy was  slipping into recession as job offers sank to their lowest level in  four years, while consumer spending and industrial output  tumbled.      The raft of gloomy data came on the eve of a key index of Japanese  business confidence that is expected to have fallen into negative  territory for the first time in almost five years.      Japan&amp;#039;s unemployment rate rose to 4.2 percent in August from 4.0  percent in July with only 86 jobs on offer for every 100 job  seekers, the lowest since September 2004, official figures  showed.      The jobs market is &amp;quot;on a downtrend,&amp;quot; a labour ministry official  said. The figures added to the jittery mood among investors, with  Tokyo stocks tumbling 4.1 percent to hit a three-year low after US  lawmakers rejected a massive financial sector rescue plan.      Industrial production dropped by 3.5 percent in August from the  previous month, which was the steepest fall since comparable  records began in 2003 and worse than markets had expected.      The trade and industry ministry slashed its forecast for output in  September, saying it would rise by 1.6 percent, not 3.4 percent as  predicted a month ago.      Output is then expected to edge down 0.1 percent in October, said  the ministry, based on a survey of manufacturers.      The economy is worsening more rapidly than company managers  expected, said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Daiwa Institute of  Research.      &amp;quot;There had been a common view that the economy would go through a  mild correction but be spared a major recession,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;There  will be more negative surprises ahead.&amp;quot;      Japan&amp;#039;s economy suffered its worst contraction in seven years in  the second quarter of this year.      &amp;quot;We think it is reasonable to conclude that the Japanese economy  entered a recession from the fourth quarter of 2007 since past  experience shows that the production index declines for three or  more quarters during slowdowns,&amp;quot; analysts at RBS Securities wrote  in a note to clients.      Consumer spending, another key pillar of the economy, also remains  sluggish.      Household spending tumbled by 4.0 percent in August from a year  earlier, a much bigger drop than expected, a separate report  showed.      Naoki Murakami, chief economist at online securities company Monex,  said a slowdown in hiring was curbing consumption.      &amp;quot;A rise in prices of daily necessities has reduced purchasing power  in real terms and dampened consumer sentiment.&amp;quot;      Markets are bracing for more gloomy news on the Japanese economy on  Wednesday when the Bank of Japan will release the results of its  closely watched Tankan survey of the corporate sector.      The headline index of sentiment mood among big manufacturers is  expected to drop to minus one in September, turning negative for  the first time since June 2003, according to economists surveyed by  Dow Jones Newswires.      &amp;quot;Whenever this (index) has moved from positive to negative  territory, it has -- without exception -- marked the start of an  economic recession,&amp;quot; noted Kyohei Morita, chief Japan economist at  Barclays Capital.      Japanese companies are being squeezed by slowing economic growth  and the fastest inflation in a decade.      But Japan&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;current recession should be less severe and  short-lived compared to those in 1990s and the economy should go  back on a trend growth path by the fourth quarter of 2009,&amp;quot;  predicted UBS economist Akira Maekawa.       http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080930/bs_afp/japaneconomy_080930085226
