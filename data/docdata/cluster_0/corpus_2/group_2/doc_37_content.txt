One of the key indications of the market&amp;#039;s inflation expectations is the spread between yields on 10-year Treasury notes   (  UST10Y  :        U.S. Treasury 10 Year          News  ,   chart  ,   profile  ,   more          &amp;amp;nbsp;      Last:     3.71    +0.08    +2.23%          8:05pm 09/05/2008        Delayed quote data          Add to portfolio          Analyst           Create alert           Insider          Discuss          Financials           Sponsored by:                UST10Y       &amp;amp;nbsp;       3.71   ,    +0.08  ,   +2.2%  )  and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, known as TIPS.                This gap represents the rate of inflation that investors in the $515 billion market expect over the life of the debt. TIPS pay investors a coupon plus the rate of inflation as measured by the government&amp;#039;s consumer price index, effectively eliminating any erosion in the return on fixed-income securities caused by price inflation.     &amp;quot;With commodity prices falling, people are putting two and two together, said William O&amp;#039;Donnell, U.S. bond strategist at UBS Securities. &amp;quot;The weaker global growth and weaker commodity prices in lockstep is a toxic combination for inflation. People are not rushing for inflation protection.&amp;quot;     The gap between regular 10-year Treasurys and TIPS yields has fallen to 1.93%, a level not seen since 2003. The drop in commodity prices, chiefly oil, is being interpreted as easing pressure on virtually all other kinds of prices.                                                     &amp;#039;If inflation falls below what the market is pricing in for the next few years, I would expect an aggressive response from the Fed to push inflation back up to avoid the risk of deflation.&amp;#039;                 Michael Pond, Barclays Capital                                        That&amp;#039;s a big drop for the so-called breakeven rate from 2.57% in July, just before crude-oil futures hit an all-time high above $147 a barrel. The benchmark crude contract fell below $106 a barrel at one point on Friday.   See Futures Movers.       &amp;quot;Inflation pressures have been taken off, along with the decline in commodity prices,&amp;quot; said Alex Li, interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse. &amp;quot;If energy prices are dropping, there&amp;#039;s no need for companies to pass that along to consumers.&amp;quot;     Along these lines, signs of further economic weakness around the world suggest oil prices may even go as low as $87 a barrel in the next three to six months, according to UBS.     And in a key survey this week, businesses not engaged in manufacturing say that price increases for inputs slowed in August. The prices paid component of the Institute for Supply Management&amp;#039;s services index, released Thursday, declined to 72.9 from 80.8.   See related story.       Hardly deflation    Still, the differences between the current environment and 2003 may point to the current breakeven rate being too low, noted Michael Pond, Treasury and inflation-linked strategist at Barclays Capital, one of the largest dealers of TIPS.     The last time the breakeven rate was this low, the actual inflation rate as measured by the Labor Department&amp;#039;s consumer price index was significantly lower. In the year through July 2003, roughly when the TIPS breakeven was this low, actual CPI was 2.1%.     The index has jumped 5.6% in the 12 months through this July, the most recent data available.   See full CPI story.       Also back in 2003, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, then a Fed governor, and predecessor Alan Greenspan were more worried about deflation in the economy and were intent on creating a floor for the inflation rate to prevent that by lowering interest rates, Pond said.     &amp;quot;If inflation falls below what the market is pricing in for the next few years, I would expect an aggressive response from the Fed to push inflation back up to avoid the risk of deflation,&amp;quot; via lowering interest rates, Pond said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s possible that inflation comes in where the market is priced, but it&amp;#039;s not likely and there is clear upside risk.&amp;quot;     The Fed&amp;#039;s role    For now, interest-rate futures traders have eliminated bets the Fed will increase its target lending rate from 2% as a deteriorating employment market drags down economic growth.     As recently as Thursday, the December futures contract showed a one-in-four chance of a rate hike, to 2.25%. Earlier this year, the futures market showed expectations of several increases from the current 2% target rate to curb inflation.     Plenty of investors say the breakeven has gone too low and are looking for a buying opportunity in TIPS, Pond said. A lot of the recent TIPS selling activity has come from managers reducing positions in commodities, therefore possibly undoing hedges in TIPS.     &amp;quot;Over the next couple months, we expect TIPS to perform well versus nominal Treasurys,&amp;quot; Pond said. He said some investors are sure inflation won&amp;#039;t go as low as the current breakeven rate and they want protection against rising prices.
