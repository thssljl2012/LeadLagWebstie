New York&amp;#039;s main contract, light sweet crude for October delivery, gained 6.01 dollars on Tuesday&amp;#039;s close to finish at 97.16 dollars.      Meanwhile, London&amp;#039;s Brent North Sea crude for delivery in November gained 5.62 dollars to end on 94.84 dollars.      John Kilduff, an analyst with MF Global, said part of the reason for the rebound is that the rescue of AIG appears to avert a wider financial crisis that hurts the economy and lowers energy demand.      ****                      So we&amp;#039;re back to last Thursday&amp;#039;s prices.      Tis just money trying to find a home. Same reason why gold and silver shot up.      When is St. Ledger&amp;#039;s day this year anyway?
