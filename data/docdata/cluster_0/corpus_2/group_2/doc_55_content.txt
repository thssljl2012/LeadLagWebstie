Asia Stocks Fall for Fifth Day on Growth Concerns; Nissan Drops   By Chua Kong Ho   Sept. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks fell for a fifth day, set for the biggest weekly decline in a year, after rising U.S. jobless claims deepened concern economic growth is stalling and sparked a global sell-off.   Nissan Motor Co. fell 2.9 percent after U.S. unemployment rolls rose to the highest in almost five years. Rio Tinto Group dropped 1.9 percent after raw materials prices declined, adding to the biggest weekly sell-off for Asian commodity stocks in at least 13 years. Mizuho Financial Group Inc. tumbled 5.9 percent after Bill Gross, manager of the world&amp;#039;s biggest bond fund, warned of a ``financial tsunami&amp;#039;&amp;#039; and Goldman, Sachs &amp;amp;amp; Co. told investors to sell Merrill Lynch &amp;amp;amp; Co. as writedowns rise.   ``Sentiment is terrible,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors, which manages about $108 billion. ``You&amp;#039;ve got this ongoing correction in commodity prices, issues regarding financials, and concerns about profit downgrades in economically-sensitive companies.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;   The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 2 percent to 116.89 as of 2:30 p.m. in Tokyo. The measure is headed for a 6.7 percent drop this week and the lowest since July 19, 2006. Only one of the benchmark&amp;#039;s 10 industry groups rose, with about seven stocks declining for each that advanced.   The region&amp;#039;s index has tumbled 26 percent in 2008, almost twice the drop in the Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s 500 Index, as a global slowdown cuts demand for the region&amp;#039;s exports and financial companies post losses and writedowns stemming from the credit crisis. More than $15 trillion has been wiped off global stock markets since the October 2007 peak.   BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio led MSCI&amp;#039;s index of 114 Asian materials stocks to a 12 percent tumble this week, headed for its biggest weekly loss since the measure started in January 1995.

Sony Corp. fell after announcing a worldwide computer recall. Sumco Corp. tumbled after second-quarter profit decreased.

All markets open in Asia declined.   The S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 yesterday dropped 3 percent in the longest stretch of losses since January after the number of people staying on jobless rolls rose the highest since November 2003.

Toyota Motor Corp., which gets more than a third of its sales in the region, dropped 1.9 percent to 4,780 yen. Mazda Motor Corp. tumbled 6 percent to 532 yen, the most in a month.   Canon Inc., which gets almost 80 of its sales outside of Japan, declined 2.5 percent to 4,650 yen. Japanese exporters also fell as the yen gained against the euro to the highest in more than a year and appreciated versus the dollar to the strongest since July 17. A stronger local currency reduces Japanese companies&amp;#039; repatriated overseas sales.   Capital spending in Japan excluding software fell 7.6 percent in the three months ended June 30, a fifth-straight quarterly decline, data today showed.

Rio Tinto, the world&amp;#039;s No. 2 mining company, slid 1.9 percent, while BHP, the biggest, lost 1.3 percent to A$36.64, as a measure of six metals traded on the London Metal Exchange dropped 1.1 percent.
