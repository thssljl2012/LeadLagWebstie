 Oil steadies after dive on financial turmoil        http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080930/india_nm/india357239;_ylt=AqGpZ6MdLBVMTWFF93WR1Za9IxIF       LONDON (Reuters) -  Oil steadied near $96 a barrel on Tuesday  after a near 10 percent drop in the previous session in the wake of  the shock rejection by U.S. lawmakers of a $700-billion financial  sector rescue plan.      Asian stocks posted the biggest monthly decline in more than a  decade and major European stock markets lost further ground after  Monday&amp;#039;s steep slide.      Traders expect oil demand to suffer as the economy weakens.      &amp;quot;For energy prices, I fear additional downside in values is still  around the corner,&amp;quot; said Rob Laughlin, an oil broker at MF  Global.       &amp;quot;There is no doubt that oil demand is going to suffer as the global  recession bites and geopolitical unrest remains on the backburner,  so a test lower is highly likely.&amp;quot;      U.S. crude was up 1 cent at $96.38 a barrel by 0908 GMT, after  losing $10.52 on Monday to $96.37 -- the second biggest fall since  April 23, 2003. London Brent crude was down 3 cents at $93.95.      On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 228 to 205  against a bailout plan that would have allowed the Treasury to buy  up toxic assets from banks. The rejection of the plan sent global  stock markets sliding.       &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s just reinforcing the belief that the U.S. economy is  really heading towards a downward spiral. That means the demand  side of the equation for oil will deteriorate rapidly,&amp;quot; said Toby  Hassall, chief analyst at Commodity Warrants Australia in  Sydney.      &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s just getting worse and worse and no one knows when this is  going to end.&amp;quot;      Oil has fallen sharply from a record high of $147.27 reached in  July on signs that high energy prices and the financial crisis have  cut into crude demand in the United States and other industrialised  nations.       In addition, oil has also been dragged down as investors, who had  rushed into commodities earlier this year as a hedge against  inflation and the weak dollar, sold crude for safer havens.      Analysts said the spread of credit problems to Europe was also  stoking fears that the financial turmoil, which started with risky  lending to the overheated U.S. property market, had gone rapidly  global.      &amp;quot;Slower international economic growth is bound to dent oil demand,&amp;quot;  said David Moore, a commodities analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of  Australia.
