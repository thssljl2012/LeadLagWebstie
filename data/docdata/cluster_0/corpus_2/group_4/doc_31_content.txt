SYDNEY, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar was battling    to hold its ground on Tuesday as a late slide in U.S. stocks and    persistent concerns of global recession hurt riskier investments    to the benefit of sovereign bonds.    * Australian dollar holding around around $0.6490,    having bounced from $0.6350/60 support on Monday to reach as high    as $0.6597 before running out of steam.    * Aussie was initially aided by poor economic news from the    United States which dragged on the U.S. dollar, but began to tire    late in New York session as stocks turned lower once more.    * A New York Fed gauge of manufacturing showed activity in    the region fell to a record low, while Citigroup  intends to cut up to 50,000 jobs, or 15    percent of its work force.    * The late drop in U.S. equities added to risk aversion and    benefited the safe-haven Japanese yen. The Aussie dipped back to    62.55 yen, from a 64.11 peak.    * The same focus on safety boosted bonds, with short-term    futures reaching record highs and bill futures almost fully    priced for a 100 basis-point rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of    Australia (RBA) next month.    * The RBA will release the minutes of its November meeting at    11:30 a.m. (0030 GMT) and may explain why it chose to cut rates    by a surprisingly large 75 basis points to 5.25 percent.    * Three-year bond futures firmed 0.035 to 96.245,    having touched an all-time high of 96.305 earlier. The 10-year    contract added 0.045 points to 95.070.    * Commodities were mostly weaker. Oil lost $1.94 to    $55.10, while the CRB index shed 1.51 percent to 243.84.
