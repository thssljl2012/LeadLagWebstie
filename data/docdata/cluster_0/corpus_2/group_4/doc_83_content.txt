SYDNEY, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar fell further    from recent two-weeks highs on Friday, with deepening concerns    about a global economic slowdown keeping investors away from    higher-yielding currencies and riskier assets.    * The International Monetary Fund cut its 2009 global    economic growth to 2.2 percent, from 3 percent forecast in    October. It expects the U.S. economy to contract by 0.7 percent    next year, while the euro zone is expected to shrink by 0.5    percent, hurt by the financial market turmoil.    * By 9:40 a.m. (2240 GMT), the Aussie slipped to    $0.6635, from $0.6724 late here on Thursday and nearly four cents    below a two-week peak of $0.7015 on Nov. 4.    * Commodities fell sharply along with stock markets    after another raft of U.S. data provided further evidence of a    looming recession in the world&amp;#039;s largest economy. Those concerns    led jittery investors to unwind leveraged carry trades.    * As a result, the Aussie fell to 64.67 yen from 65.63 yen  late here on Thursday.    * Central banks in Europe stepped in to support their    economies by cutting rates. The Bank of England slashed rates by    a 150 basis points, but the European Central Bank disappointed    investors with only a 50 basis point reduction.    * Investors were hoping for a more aggressive cut by the ECB,    though President Jean-Claude Trichet softened the blow somewhat    saying he did not rule out further cuts. The weaker euro also    pulled down on the Aussie.    * The Swiss National Bank cut interest rates and its chairman    said the central bank expects the economy to shrink next year. .

The central bank cut the    cash rate by a larger-than-expected 75 basis points to 5.25    percent earlier this week after a 100 basis point cut in October.    * Australian bond futures were firmer, especially at the    shorter end, helped by safe-haven inflows. U.S. Treasuries also    rose as stock market losses drove investors to the relative    safety of government bonds.    * Three-year bond futures rose 0.055 points to    95.885, while the 10-year futures contract slipped 0.1    points to 94.84.
