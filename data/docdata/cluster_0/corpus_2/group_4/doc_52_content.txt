By Keith Weir    LONDON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Germany is in recession and China&amp;#039;s industry output growth has waned to its weakest in seven years, data from the world&amp;#039;s top exporting nations showed on Thursday, providing further evidence of a global economic slide.    Adding to the bleak picture, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) slashed its economic output forecasts for the United States, Japan and euro zone, predicting a tumble into recession for all three.    The worst financial crisis in 80 years, which rippled around the world following the collapse of the U.S. housing market, is taking a heavy toll on economic activity.    Germany said its economy, Europe&amp;#039;s largest, contracted by  0.5 percent in the third quarter, putting it in recession for the first time in five years.    The decline -- much sharper than the 0.2 percent forecast -- was accentuated by German export growth grinding to a halt.    &amp;#039;We are going to have to face up to a very difficult and long-lasting economic crisis,&amp;#039; Germany&amp;#039;s Deputy Economy Minister Walther Otremba told Reuters.    Analysts agreed with that grim forecast.    &amp;#039;The headwinds of the financial crisis and the global economic slowdown are blowing right in the face of the German economy,&amp;#039; said Carsten Brzeski of ING Financial Markets.    &amp;#039;Even more worrying, the full impact of the financial crisis still has to unfold,&amp;#039; he said. &amp;#039;If you think today&amp;#039;s numbers are already bad, just wait for the next quarter.&amp;#039;    In China, which has unveiled a 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) stimulus package, annual industrial output growth slowed to 8.2 percent in October, its weakest showing since Oct. 2001, as manufacturers scaled back production.    Among corporates, British telecoms company BT Group said it was cutting 10,000 jobs at home and overseas.    Wal-Mart Stores Inc    hit a 22-month low at $55 a barrel on worries that a recession will curb demand.    Stocks in Europe were 0.6 percent lower, the third straight day of losses and U.S. stock futures extended losses after a steeper-than-expected surge in the number of Americans filing for jobless benefits.    Banks from Asia to Europe warned of tough times ahead.    Mizuho Financial Group, Japan&amp;#039;s second biggest bank, plans to raise up to $3.1 billion after unveiling a $402 million quarterly loss. Bank of Ireland&amp;#039;s profits fell by a third and it cancelled its cash dividend and shares in Commonwealth Bank of Australia hit a four-year low after it warned investors to expect a big jump in bad debts.
