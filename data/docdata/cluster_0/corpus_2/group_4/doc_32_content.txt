 RBA spends record $3bn defending Australian dollar      http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au...-20142,00.html      November 20, 2008   The Reserve Bank of Australia mounted an unprecedented defence of the Australian dollar in October as the currency was savaged against the backdrop of a rapidly souring global growth  outlook, according to data issued today.     The central bank bought $3.15 billion in spot currency markets in October , according to the bank&amp;#039;s November bulletin, its biggest one-month intervention since the RBA began keeping records in 1995      The defensive effort has helped to hold the currency above US60 cents, but RBA officials have said it is not defending a particular level.      The Australian dollar rallied today on confirmation of the size of the intervention.    [...]  Intervention in October surpassed the $2.63 billion bought in June 1998 when the currency was plunging as the Asian Financial Crisis sapped confidence in regional currencies.    [...]  The RBA has intervened to support the Australian dollar a number of times in early November.    The Aussie has fallen by close to 35 per cent against the US dollar since mid-year, prompting the central bank last week to nudge higher its medium term  inflation  forecasts.    From a policy perspective, the RBA&amp;#039;s record spend on buying the Australian dollar is a &amp;amp;quot;good and defendable&amp;amp;quot; decision, said Patrick Bennett, strategist at Societe Generale.    &amp;amp;quot; To stand and defend any level would be crazy, and I don&amp;#039;t think they&amp;#039;re doing that ,&amp;amp;quot; he said.    [...]  Richard Grace, head of currency strategy at Commonwealth Bank, said the size of the intervention shows the strong resolve of the RBA to bring order back to currency markets.    &amp;amp;quot; It&amp;#039;s quite significant&amp;amp;quot; and traders should expect further action ahead if the RBA deems it necessary, he said. &amp;amp;quot;They&amp;#039;re willing to stand by and provide liquidity .&amp;amp;quot;        Akut:   $0,6225   ( -0,0153 / -2,40% )    Gru,  Swai
