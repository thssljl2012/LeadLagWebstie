 Tuesday morning thoughts from TC       Good morning. Overnight in Asia on the major indices, the euphoria from China&amp;#039;s $600 billion dollar stimulus package has come to a screeching halt and the indices are back in sell mode. It certainly didn&amp;#039;t take investors long to figure out if China needed that big of a stimulus package all is not as rosy for their economy as has been previously predicted. Today in Asia more gloomy economic data was released, with confidence among Japanese service sector workers hitting a record low in October and South Korean exports sliding 26 percent during the first part of November from a year earlier. Japan&amp;#039;s Nikkei average was down 3% after having jumped nearly 6% on Monday. Automakers and exporters led the decline. China&amp;#039;s Hang Seng is down 4.77%, however construction and infrastructure related companies climbed for a second day on hopes that China&amp;#039;s big spending targeting infrastructure would provide a boon of new orders. Market analyists are calling for further weakness in the Asian indices with year end approaching, as more hedge fund selling is expected to raise cash holdings and prepare for investor redemptions. The sharp sell off across financial markets in October was driven in part by funds selling assets to boost cash holdings, especially with money markets remaining under such severe stress. Highlighting the cross-asset liquidation in October, data on Tuesday showed foreign investors dumped a record 2.7 trillion yen ($27.6 billion) of Japanese bonds in addition to 1.32 trillion yen ($13.5 billion) of stocks last month. Emerging market stocks as measured by MSCI lost around 3 percent today, taking that index into negative territory in what would be the fifth month in a row for losses. The emerging market index has lost 54 percent of its value so far this year while its developed market counterpart has lost 41 percent. The worries about economic and corporate growth also spread to commodities, which had rallied strongly on Monday because of the Chinese stimulus package. Demand for commodities and hence prices generally fall when economies slow. I expect the 9% growth that had been predicted for China&amp;#039;s economy to be revised sharply lower, sure seems like lofty numbers with the rest of the world experiencing negative growth for the most part.      In Europe the major indices have all opened lower this morning, most down in the 2% to 3% range. The European indices are tracking losses in the US and Asia, as economic worries returned to the fore to hurt global markets, knocking oils, miners and banks. In England the economic gloom continues with British retail sales falling for a fifth straight month in October. British house prices fell slightly less sharply in the three months to October than in the three months to September, but home sales hit the lowest in at least 30 years. Heavyweight oil companies are down sharply in Europe as crude prices have fell back to the $60 range. Lower metal prices are contributing to another sell off in the mining sector. However the biggest losers in todays slide in Europe are the bank stocks, as investors worry that the Asian banks may now need to raise capital. Everything is doom and gloom presently in Europe today, so far.      On this side of the pond in North America, the US futures are pointing to another down open for the US indices. Yesterday GM shares fell to 62 year lows on a brokerage downgrade and today we are hearing forecasts that Goldman Sachs will post its first-ever quarterly loss. Yesterday the Fed restructured its bailout of American International Group Inc, raising the package to a record $150 billion with easier terms, after a smaller rescue plan failed to stabilize the ailing insurance giant. Then AIG reported a record third-quarter loss of $24.47 billion, largely from writedowns of investments. The new package, at least $27 billion more than was previously extended, will leave the government exposed to billions of dollars of potential losses. Under the new plan, the government will get a $40 billion equity stake in AIG, spend as much as $30 billion on securities underlying the insurer&amp;#039;s credit default swaps, and spend up to $22.5 billion to buy residential mortgage securities. The good news is AIG will also accept curbs on executive pay, including a freeze of bonuses for its top 70 executives. There is nothing on the economic calendar today so the markets will be left to the manipulation of the news media for market direction. The downward selling pressure on commodities does not bode well for the Canadian indices unless this trend turns around before the markets open. Ruby Tuesday is once again rearing it&amp;#039;s ugly head.      Back in McFaulds Lake, NOT had another dismal day as the share price lost another 6.41% and closed right on support. Judging by the amount of trades it appears it was the small retail investor that was throwing in the towel on yesterdays sell off. I won&amp;#039;t go into rambling about the chart as yesterday after the close NOT had a long awaited news release and today will be show and tell time for NOT&amp;#039;s share price. It appears Prof Mungall&amp;#039;s theory that their should be more pods of Eagle One like mineralization at depth around the original discovery was correct. NOT announced they have found a new discovery 70M under the Eagle One deposit. One hole proves nothing, however the share price should respond to yesterday&amp;#039;s announcement. If NOT can do a step out from yesterday&amp;#039;s discovery hole and hit again, it would be hard to believe NOT&amp;#039;s share staying at current share price levels. In fact I expect NOT&amp;#039;s share price to get some speculative fever today and will be surprised if NOT closes the day under $1. This was just about the best news possible for current NOT shareholders. If NOT&amp;#039;s share price doesn&amp;#039;t respond today from yesterday&amp;#039;s news I would throw in the towel if I was a shareholder. I currently own no shares of NOT, but would like nothing better to jump back in and see this stock pick up the volume and come back into play. I think yesterdays news will finally turn the share price around. On the chart NOT has support at $.66, with resistance at $.86 and the 13(MA) is now at $.85 and falling. Judging by the chart of NOT, yesterdays after the market closed news release was a well kept secret, because there just isn&amp;#039;t anything on the chart to suggest the share price will turn around anytime soon. Perhaps I am wrong about expecting NOT&amp;#039;s share price to bounce and bounce hard to the upside today, but we will soon find out. &amp;quot;IF&amp;quot; NOT&amp;#039;s share price breaks out today, the 1st real heavy resistance level is all the way up at the $1.44 level, it&amp;#039;s 50(MA). For all those still holding NOT best of luck today.      FWR&amp;#039;s share price was strong yesterday and bucked the trend for the McFaulds Lake stocks and actually closed up a half of a cent to close at $.195, up 2.63%. As I noted yesterday, the inverse head and shoulders pattern remains on FWR&amp;#039;s chart and any break above $.23, it&amp;#039;s 50(MA) would be very bullish. From the chart FWR has support at $.185 and resistance at $.205, with the 13(MA) at $.18 and showing signs of turning up. All systems look like blast off may be very near at hand for FWR&amp;#039;s share price. JMHO      For McFaulds Lake investors, yesterdays news from NOT appears to be good news to me. How the market reacts to it, is another story, I assume it will be favourable. However, this news is truly only good for NOT&amp;#039;s share price and possibly FNC and FWR&amp;#039;s. If by chance the McFaulds Lake stocks in general get a boost today from NOT&amp;#039;s news, I would take the opportunity and try to get out. Current market conditions are just not favourable to be holding junior mining stocks and I don&amp;#039;t this changing any time soon. Many investors are turning to the cover of playing the ETF&amp;#039;s and are avoiding owning individual stocks like the plague. Those that refuse to follow the trend and get out of junior mining stocks, are like standing in front of a fast moving train, your chances of survival aren&amp;#039;t good. Many novice investors fail to understand how the markets work and think the stocks they are holding just can&amp;#039;t fall any farther. They often learn the sad reality after it is too late.      Best of luck to all McFaulds Lake investors.               Al
