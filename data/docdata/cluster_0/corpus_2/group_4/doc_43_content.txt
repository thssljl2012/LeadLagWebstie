WELLINGTON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The New Zealand dollar consolidated below recent highs on Friday as investor nerves about risk reappeared, stalling its recovery of the past three days.    The kiwi was swayed by broader market moves, with lower stock markets in Asia pointing to a return of risk aversion, though investors spent much of the session awaiting an interest rate decision from the Bank of Japan, which came late in local trade.    &amp;#039;All eyes are on the month-end fix at the end of London trading tonight, and on the Bank of Japan&amp;#039;s potential 25 basis point rate cut,&amp;#039; said ANZ Bank strategists in a research note.    In the event, the BOJ cut its main rate by 20 basis points to 0.3 percent, sending the yen broadly higher.    At 0420 GMT the kiwi was at $0.5868/74 compared with $0.5923/33 in late local trade on Thursday. It traded a $0.5829 to $0.5906 range during the local session.    During the week it hit a five-and-a-half year low of $0.5352 on Monday and peaked at a one week-high of $0.6035 in offshore trade on Thursday.    Going into the weekend the kiwi was seen supported at $0.5825 with initial resistance at $0.5940.    The kiwi&amp;#039;s fortunes are still seen pinned to broader market events, and particularly stock markets as a barometer of investor risk appetite.    Local wages and jobs data next week may grab a little more attention, with expectations that labour costs will be high but there will also be a sizeable jump in the jobless rate as the recession starts to bite.    &amp;#039;Past recessions show that the upcoming 6-9 month period will likely show the greatest pain in the jobs market,&amp;#039; said Goldman Sachs JBWere economist Shamubeel Eaqub.    A Reuters poll sees wages jumping by 3.4 percent in the year through Sept. 30 but the unemployment rate rising to 4.3 percent from 3.8 percent.    New Zealand bonds were weaker along the curve as demand for safe-haven government debt diminished.    The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond, which moves inversely to prices, closed three basis points higher at 6.04 percent.
