By Ian Chua    LONDON, Nov 5 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury prices fell on    Wednesday, reversing the previous day&amp;#039;s sharp gains, after    Barack Obama won the U.S. presidential election and as investors    awaited the Treasury&amp;#039;s announcement of next week&amp;#039;s quarterly    refunding.    The market was further weighed by a sharp fall in euro zone    government bonds after interbank lending rates extended their    decline, suggesting further easing of lending conditions and on    confirmation of an imminent German economic stimulus package.    See    Most investors are looking for the Treasury at 1600 GMT to    announce more 10-year note and 30-year bond offerings to help    supply various government programmes intended to breath life    into the struggling financial industry.    The Treasury Department said on Monday it would need to    borrow a record $550 billion in the October-December quarter,    including a likely $300 billion in financing for the Federal    Reserve&amp;#039;s liquidity operations.    In terms of refunding for next week, ING said talk is about    $50-plus billion in auctions. Barclays Capital analysts said    they were increasing their expectation on the 3-year note    offering to $25 billion and keeping with their previous forecast    of $18 billion in new 10-year notes and $7 billion in the    reopening of the May 2028s.    &amp;#039;The market is bracing itself for a big refunding next week.    The Treasury has got a lot to do, that&amp;#039;s an issue but I don&amp;#039;t    think it&amp;#039;s the dominating issue at the moment,&amp;#039; said Padhraic    Garvey, rate strategist at ING in Amsterdam.    &amp;#039;The dominating issue is disinflation, (economic) slowdown    and the banking crisis.&amp;#039;    Treasury prices were mostly lower across the curve, pushing    yields higher. At 1219 GMT, the benchmark 10-year notes  yielded 3.799 percent, up 7.6 basis points on the    day, while the two-year paper yielded 1.440 percent,    up about six basis points.    These moves slightly flattened the 2-10 year yield curve to    around 236 basis points. Earlier this week, the curve steepened    to about 246 basis points, the widest in almost five years on    expectations for more interest rate cuts.    Fed funds rates futures are pricing in a 50 percent    probability the Fed will cut its 1.0 percent funds rate by 25    basis points or 50 basis points at its December meeting.    Ten-year Treasury futures fell 10/32 to 114-26/32.    The initial euphoric reaction in global stocks after    Democrat Obama won the race for the White House has started to    fade with MSCI&amp;#039;s main world stock index up just    0.4 percent while European stocks fell about 1.5    percent.    Wall Street stocks had their biggest Election Day rally ever    on Tuesday, with the Dow climbing 3.3 percent, but early    signs suggest a more sombre session on Wednesday with U.S. stock    index futures all in the red.    ING&amp;#039;s Garvey said he was bullish on U.S. Treasuries.    &amp;#039;I still think that yields can fall for the rest of this    year. It&amp;#039;s got nothing to do with the presidential election, it    has to do with the banking crisis and the economic crisis we    find ourselves in,&amp;#039; he added.    The market was also waiting for fresh clues on the health of    the vast services sector as well as private employment.    The Institute for Supply Management&amp;#039;s services index is    forecast to show contraction in the services sector last month,    while the ADP Employer Services&amp;#039; measure of private employment    for October is expected to show a contraction in private    payrolls of 100,000 after shrinking by 8,000 in September.
