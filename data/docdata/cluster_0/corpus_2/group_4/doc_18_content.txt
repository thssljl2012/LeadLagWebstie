World Daily Briefing Monday, November 3, 2008 11:17      AMFrom: &amp;quot;Investors Hub Newsdesk&amp;quot;  &amp;amp;lt;newsdesk@InvestorsHub.com&amp;amp;gt;Add      World Daily Markets Bulletin      Daily world financial news from Thomson Financial News Supplied by  advfn.com         03 Nov 2008 16:15:54      US Stocks at a Glance   US STOCKS-Biotechs lift Nasdaq; Dow and S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 flat      NEW YORK - The Nasdaq rose on Monday as investors snapped up  biotechnology shares following broker upgrades on Biogen&amp;#039;s (BIIB.O:  Quote, Profile, Research) stock, but the Dow and the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500  were little changed on concerns that the economic downturn might be  deepening.      A report showing U.S. manufacturing shrank further in October  heightened fears of a deeper recession, a day before the U.S.  presidential election. The Institute for Supply Management said its  index of national factory activity fell to 38.9 in October, a  26-year low, from 43.5 in September.      The level of 50 separates contraction from expansion. &amp;quot;Pretty grim.  It means we&amp;#039;re in a recession, it&amp;#039;s as simple as that ... a pretty  solid manufacturing recession,&amp;quot; said Robert Macintosh, chief  economist at Eaton Vance Corp in Boston.      &amp;quot;I don&amp;#039;t think the data adds anything that already wasn&amp;#039;t in the  thought process of investors. We are in a recession, the question  is how long or deep is it going to be?&amp;quot;      The Dow Jones industrial average shed 9.48 points, or 0.10 percent,  to 9,315.53. The Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s 500 Index slipped 2.91  points, or 0.30 percent, to 965.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index  edged up 5.68 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1,726.63.      Shares of energy companies weighed on both the Dow and the S&amp;amp;amp;P  500, with Chevron Corp declining 2.1 percent to $73. The drop in  energy shares coincided with a decline in oil prices as investors  worried an economic downturn would translate into less energy  demand.      Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp shed 1.5 percent to $73.03 as U.S. crude  for November delivery CLc1 lost $1.94, or nearly 3 percent, to  $65.87 a barrel.      Shares of plane maker Boeing dropped 1.7 percent to $51.42 on the  New York Stock Exchange after Goldman Sachs added the stock to a  &amp;quot;conviction sell&amp;quot; list, according to theflyonthewall.com.      The broker action overshadowed news of a deal ending a strike that  crippled Boeing&amp;#039;s Seattle area plants for 57 days. But shares of  Biogen, among stocks seen positioned to fare better in a slumping  economy, jumped 8 percent, putting the stock among the Nasdaq&amp;#039;s  standouts.      Deutsche Bank recommended a &amp;quot;buy&amp;quot; on Biogen, while Robert W. Baird,  a research firm, raised its view on the company to &amp;quot;outperform&amp;quot;  from &amp;quot;neutral.&amp;quot;      Shares of Gilead Sciences, another biotech company, climbed 2.6  percent to $47.05, as those of Amgen climbed 2.4 percent to  $61.31.      Elsewhere, shares of Wal-Mart Stores rose 2 percent to $56.97 after  a brokerage raised its rating on the retailer.      Citigroup raised its rating on chipmakers, including Nvidia Corp,  whose stock jumped 2.4 percent to $8.96, and Integrated Device  Technology, up 3.8 percent to $6.60 on Nasdaq. Investors are  bracing for Friday&amp;#039;s report on October U.S. nonfarm payrolls.      Democratic contender Barack Obama heads into Tuesday&amp;#039;s voting in a  comfortable position, with Republican opponent John McCain  struggling to overtake his lead in every national opinion poll and  to hold off his challenge in about a dozen states won by President  George W. Bush in 2004.      Obama leads McCain in six of eight key battleground states,  including the big prizes of Florida and Ohio, according to a series  of Reuters/Zogby polls released on Monday.            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Everything you need - in one site!

The scale of investors&amp;#039; deleveraging was highlighted in October,  when the dollar index posted its biggest monthly percentage gain in  17 years and the euro suffered its largest monthly fall against the  dollar and yen since its 1999 launch.      Concern about the prospect of a global recession was expected to  limit gains in riskier assets and offer support to the low-yielding  dollar and yen.      &amp;quot;The problem for the market is that all the trades that worked well  for the past 5 years went badly very quickly,&amp;quot; said Michael  Rosborough, senior global FX strategist at Citigroup in London. &amp;quot;On  bounces like this you would expect to see people still liquidating  and using them as an opportunity to lighten up on positions,&amp;quot; he  added.      By 1200 GMT, the euro was up 0.9 percent on the day at $1.2845 and  rose 1.6 percent to 127.34 yen. Sterling rose around 0.7 percent  against the dollar to $1.6190, while the dollar gained 0.7 percent  to 99.14 yen. The high-yielding Australian and New Zealand dollars  also rose around 1.4 percent versus the U.S. currency.      World stocks, as measured by MSCI&amp;#039;s all-country index, rose 0.9  percent on the day. Major events this week include the U.S.  presidential election on Tuesday, with a win by Democrat Barack  Obama generally seen as more favourable for financial markets.      Also, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the  Reserve Bank of Australia are all expected to lower interest rates  to protect their struggling economies from the threat of a looming  global recession.      Each of them is expected to cut rates by at least half a percentage  point. The U.S. Federal Reserve last week cut its key rate by half  a point to 1.0 percent and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) cut its rate to  0.30 percent from 0.50 percent.      Analysts said Britain&amp;#039;s central bank could cut rates by more than  the half percentage point that is expected. &amp;quot;The risks are tilted  toward an even larger move, as the upside risks to inflation have  diminished significantly, according to resident BoE hawk (Tim)  Besley,&amp;quot; RBC strategists said in a note to clients.      Emerging giants China and India also cut rates last week. Economic  weakness was underscored by a report on euro zone manufacturing  activity, which sank in October below record low levels initially  estimated.      The Markit Eurozone Purchasing Managers Index for the manufacturing  sector fell to 41.1 -- the lowest in the survey&amp;#039;s 11-year history  -- from September&amp;#039;s 45.0. That was below the flash estimate and  economists&amp;#039; forecasts of 41.3.      The release marks the fifth consecutive month the PMI index has  been below the 50 mark that divides growth from contraction. The  U.S. Institute of Supply Management&amp;#039;s factory activity index, due  out at 1500 GMT, is also expected to show further weakness.  Economists expect a reading of 41.5 versus 43.5 in September.            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Financials   For stock market quotes, company information, stock charts,  historical quarterly reports and historical annual reports, click  here            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Europe share   FTSE rises at midday as miners offset bank losses      LONDON - Britain&amp;#039;s leading share index had edged up by midday on  Monday, sustained by gains in commodity stocks, while concern about  Barclays&amp;#039; fundraising dented banking stocks.      Miners were among the top performers on the FTSE 100 as improved  risk appetite boosted metal prices, while energy shares rallied as  the price of crude oil rose modestly.      By 12:05 p.m. British time, the benchmark index rose 25.79 points  to 4,402.66, on track for a fifth day of gains, its longest since  December 2007.      The index gained 12.7 percent last week, its strongest week on  record, fed by anticipation of a widely-expected interest rate cut  from the Bank of England later this week, although it was down 10.7  percent in October.      Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin said the market  has reacted positively to a spate of interest rate cuts in the  United States, China, India and Japan, turning the spotlight to the  BoE on Thursday. &amp;quot;The underlying tone of the market has improved.  There is an encouraging feel to what is going on,&amp;quot; he said.      However, he said the outlook for the banking sector remained  unfavourable as potential recession in Britain has prompted fears  of further write-downs and bad debts.      Banks tempered gains on the broader market, as Barclays dropped 4.9  percent on concern that its $12 billion (7.4 billion pounds)  capital fundraising is too expensive. Analysts at Merril Lynch  estimated the fundraising may cost investors 3.2 billion  pounds.      Lloyds TSB, the British bank in the process of buying rival HBOS,  lost 0.7 percent after it said its profits for the first nine  months of the year fell sharply as a result of financial market  turmoil and rising bad debts.      HBOS climbed 4.3 percent after the Sunday Times newspaper said  Lloyds TSB could face competition for its bid from HBOS&amp;#039;s Internet  banking unit.      HBSC and Royal Bank of Scotland fell 2.9 and 1.4 percent  respectively, while Standard Chartered advanced 3.2 percent.      Among other decliners were index-heavyweights Vodafone and  supermarket group Tesco fell 3.7 percent, while Vodafone shed 4.3  percent.      Helping keep the FTSE 100 in positive territory were the commodity  stocks as a weaker dollar supported base and precious metal prices,  while crude oil futures turned positive.      Kazakhmys surged 13.3 percent, lifted by rising copper prices.  Xstrata, Vedanta Resources, Lonmin and E...
