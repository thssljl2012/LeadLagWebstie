Its measure of confidence plunged 21 points to -29,    gloomier even than the depths reached in the 1990/91 recession.    ___________________________________  ____________________________    * The Australian dollar extended losses, falling below 67    U.S. cents on Tuesday, as investors moved back to the safety of    low-yielding currencies and government bonds on mounting worries    about a global recession.    * The NAB business survey added to a gloomier picture    emerging for the Australian economy after fresh evidence from the    euro zone backed views that the economy there had probably    already slipped into a recession.    * Australia&amp;#039;s central bank on Monday cut its economic growth    forecasts and said it would review interest rates in the months    ahead with the aim of preventing a sharper downturn as the credit    turmoil takes its toll.    * Shortly after midday, the Aussie was at $ 0.6722    against the U.S. dollar, down from $0.6866 late here on Monday.    It rose as high as $0.6985 on Monday, not far from a peak of    $0.7015 struck on Nov. 4.    * Lower regional stock markets pulled the Aussie down to    65.17 yen, from 67.93 yen, as demand for leveraged    carry trades took a hit.    * Australian bond futures extended their surge, buoyed by    safe-haven inflows while December bill futures added to    their gains on expectations of aggressive interest rate cuts next    month.    * The central bank cut its cash rate by a larger than    expected 75 basis points to 5.25 percent last week, after a 100    basis point cut in October. Markets are pricing in a 75 basis    point cut next month with some even hoping for a cut before the    December 2 meeting.    * Three-year bond futures were 0.195 points higher at 96.00 , while the 10-year futures contract added 0.145    points to 94.95.
