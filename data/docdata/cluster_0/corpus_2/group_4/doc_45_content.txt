SYDNEY, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar fell on    Tuesday after the central bank cut interest rates more sharply    than expected and said domestic activity and spending was likely    to weaken on the back of a sharp global downturn.    The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut the cash rate by 75    basis points to 5.25 percent. Investors had been pricing in an    easing of 50 basis points to 5.5 percent, with weak data on    Monday backing views that the credit crunch was taking a toll on    the Australian economy.    The Aussie eased to $0.6655 from $0.6715 before the    rate decision. It struck a 5-   year low of $0.6007 last month.    Australian bond futures were higher. Three-year bond futures  rose 0.145 points to 95.565, while the 10-year futures    contract added 0.06 points to 94.66.
