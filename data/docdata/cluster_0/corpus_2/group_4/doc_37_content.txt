Stocks lost ground while commodities were dumped on    worries demand for natural resources would be hit by an economic    downturn. Australia is a major exporter of resources.    * The International Monetary Fund cut its 2009 global    economic growth to 2.2 percent, from 3 percent forecast in    October. It expects the U.S. economy to contract by 0.7 percent    next year, while the euro zone is expected to shrink by 0.5    percent, hurt by the financial market turmoil.    * Recent data from the United States has been pointing to a    deep recession and further evidence could emerge later when the    employment report for October is released. The economy is    expected to shed 200,000 jobs, having lost 159,000 in September.    * Shortly after midday, the Aussie slipped to $0.6615,    from $0.6724 late here on Thursday and four cents below a    two-week peak of $0.7015 on Nov. 4.    * The Aussie fell to 64.33 yen from 65.63 yen late    here on Thursday as investors unwound carry trades.    * Central banks in Europe stepped in to support their    economies by cutting rates. The Bank of England slashed rates by    150 basis points, but the European Central Bank disappointed    investors with only a 50 basis point reduction.    * Australian bill futures gained as investors priced    in chances of more domestic rate reductions by the end of the    year. Markets are factoring in another 75 basis point cut in    December by the Reserve Bank of Australia..    * Australian bond futures, especially at the shorter end,    jumped on safe-haven inflows and hopes of further easing in    monetary policy. The RBA lowered the cash rate by a bigger than    expected 75 basis points earlier this week.    * Three-year bond futures rose 0.08 points to 95.910, while    the 10-year futures contract shed 0.020 points to 94.81. As a    result the yield curve steepened further.
