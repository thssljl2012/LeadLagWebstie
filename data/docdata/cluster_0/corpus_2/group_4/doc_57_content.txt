  On pages 5-7, this report shows a decline in oil sand production in 2008. Of the three major Canadian oil sand projects scheduled to come on-line in 2008 two are way over costs and the third has been halted.        I guess the 37 mbd in oil sand production estimated by 2030 by the cornucopians must be becoming ridiculous even to them. The Alberta oil sands group currently predicts 3 mbd by 2015. Of course, they have more oil than Saudi Arabia            If I didn&amp;#039;t know otherwise, I would have guessed this report to be coming from a PO group.
