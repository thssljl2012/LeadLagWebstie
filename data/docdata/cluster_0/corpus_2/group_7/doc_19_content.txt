     Chinese demand helps gold break $960      By Javier Blas in London       Published: February 17 2009 11:00   Last updated: February 17 2009 11:00                          Gold prices surged on Tuesday to a fresh seven month high on Tuesday, trading above $960 a troy ounce and hitting record highs denominated in euros and     sterling, boosted by strong buying by Japanese and Chinese investors.        The strong buying in Tokyo came a day after Japan, the world's second largest economy, reported it suffered its worst economic slump in 35 years,     with the economy contracting 3.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the last three months of 2008.                 The rush the gold safety was exacerbated by concerns about Western banks' exposure to Eastern European countries and signs that Russia's central     bank plans to buy more gold for its official reserves, traders said.        John Reade, a metals strategist at UBS in London, said that investment demand was "super-strong" and analysts say that the precious metal is     likely to test the $1,000 level in the near future. Gold hit a nominal all-time high of $1,080.30 last March.        In London, spot bullion rose to $962.5 an ounce, up from Monday's last quote of $941.05, and the highest level since mid-July. In New York, the less     relevant Comex June gold futures surged to an intraday high of $966.5 an ounce.        Silver and, to a lesser extent, platinum and palladium rose, boosted by investors buying. In London, spot silver traded as high as $13.92 an ounce.        Bullion holdings at gold-backed exchanged traded funds were steady on Monday because of the US bank holiday. The world's largest gold-backed ETF     fund, the New York-listed SPDR Gold Trust, holdings stood at a record high of 985.86 tonnes.        Edel Tully, of Mitsui &amp; Co. in London, said that ETF investors were firmly in the driving seat and will dictate gold's next direction.     "Gold is actively preparing for the $1,000 move, and if the ETF soldiers continue to surge on, then this price target is achievable in the near     future," she said.        Investors are also pouring into small bars and bullion coins, according to reports from key mints. The US Mint has sold so far this year 128,500 ounces     of its popular American Eagle bullion coin, almost the same it sold in the first fourth months of 2008.        Michael O'Kane, of the New Zealand Mint in Auckland, said that since the middle of January he had notice a "definite resurgence in precious     metal buying", with the predominant attitude being one of owning gold or silver as "opposed to worrying about what price is being paid."        Investors are taking over the traditional backbone of gold demand - the jewellery sector - and some traders are concerned that without a revival of     jewellery consumption in key markets in India, Turkey or the Middle East, gold prices will struggle to post further gains.                    http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0...dd-a103-000077b07658.html
