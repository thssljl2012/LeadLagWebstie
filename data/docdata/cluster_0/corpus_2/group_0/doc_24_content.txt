  Dear Friends    And the First Quarter Review follows . Full statement can be viewed at : http://rbi.org.in/scripts/Notificati...Id=4380&amp;amp;amp;Mode=0    Best wishes,   RAJESH H DHRUVA        First Quarter Review of the Annual Statement on Monetary Policy for the Year 2008-09  - RBI Governor presented the First Quarter Review of Annual Statement on Monetary Policy for the Year 2008-09 today.       Highlights      Bank Rate kept unchanged.       Reverse Repo Rate under LAF kept unchanged.       Repo Rate increased by 50 basis points from 8.5 per cent to 9.00 per cent.      Cash Reserve Ratio to be increased by 25 basis points to 9.0 per cent with effect from the fortnight beginning August 30, 2008.       GDP growth projection for 2008-09 revised from the range of 8.0-8.5 per cent to around 8.0 per cent, barring domestic or external shocks.      While the policy actions would aim to bring down the current intolerable level of inflation to a tolerable level of below 5.0 per cent as soon as possible and around 3.0 per cent over the medium-term, at this juncture a realistic policy endeavour would be to bring down inflation from the current level of about 11.0-12.0 per cent to a level close to 7.0 per cent by March 31, 2009.      While there are early signs of some moderation in money supply and deposit growth, they continue to expand above the indicative projections warranting continuous vigilance and appropriate and timely policy responses.       In view of the evolving environment of heightened uncertainty in global markets and the dangers of potential spillovers to domestic markets, liquidity management will continue to receive priority in the hierarchy of policy objectives over the period ahead.      Barring the emergence of any adverse and unexpected developments in various sectors of the economy, assuming that capital flows are effectively managed, and keeping in view the current assessment of the economy including the outlook for growth and inflation, the overall stance of monetary policy in 2008-09 will broadly continue to be:      To ensure a monetary and interest rate environment that accords high priority to price stability, well-anchored inflation expectations and orderly conditions in financial markets while being conducive to continuation of the growth momentum.      To respond swiftly on a continuing basis to the evolving constellation of adverse international developments and to the domestic situation impinging on inflation expectations, financial stability and growth momentum, with both conventional and unconventional measures, as appropriate.      To emphasise credit quality as well as credit delivery, in particular, for employment-intensive sectors, while pursuing financial inclusion.       Details      Dr. Y. Venugopal Reddy, Governor, today presented the First Quarter Review of Annual Statement on Monetary Policy for the Year 2008-09. The Review consists of three sections: I. Assessment of Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments; II. Stance of Monetary Policy; and III. Monetary Measures.       Domestic Developments      Real GDP growth in 2007-08 was revised upwards to 9.0 per cent by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) in its end-May 2008 estimates from the advance estimates of 8.7 per cent released in February 2008.      Inflation, measured by variations in the wholesale price index (WPI) on a year-on-year basis, increased to 11.89 per cent as on July 12, 2008 from 7.75 per cent as at end-March 2008 and 4.76 per cent a year ago.      On a year-on-year basis, inflation based on the consumer price index (CPI) for agricultural labourers and rural labourers increased to 8.8 per cent and 8.7 per cent, respectively, in June 2008 from 7.8 per cent and 7.5 per cent a year ago.       Year-on-year inflation based on CPI for industrial workers and urban non-manual employees stood at 7.8 per cent and 6.8 per cent, respectively, in May 2008 as compared with 6.6 per cent and 6.8 per cent a year ago.       The CPI-based inflation measures have increased in the range of 2.0-3.2 percentage points over their levels in January 2008.      The price of the Indian basket of crude oil increased from US $ 99.4 per barrel in March 2008 to US $ 129.8 in June 2008 and further to US $ 141.5 on July 3, 2008 before declining to US $ 121.9 on July 25, 2008.      Money supply (M3) increased by 20.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis on July 4, 2008, lower than 21.8 per cent a year ago.       The year-on-year growth in aggregate deposits of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) at 21.7 per cent (Rs.5,89,646 crore) up to July 4, 2008 was lower than 24.6 per cent (Rs.5,36,617 crore) a year ago.       Up to July 4, 2008 non-food credit of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) rose by 25.9 per cent (Rs.4,85,709 crore) on a year-on-year basis, higher than 24.6 per cent (Rs.3,69,109 crore) a year ago.       Public sector oil marketing companies have been provided US $ 4.3 billion (Rs.19,325 crore) against oil bonds purchased under the Special Market Operation (SMO) scheme up to July 25, 2008.       The total overhang of liquidity as reflected in the balances under the LAF, the MSS and the Central Governments cash balances taken together declined from an average of  Rs.2,42,370 crore in April 2008 to Rs.2,12,201 crore in May 2008 and Rs.1,93,726 crore in June 2008 (with an intra-year peak of Rs.2,93,048 crore on April 8, 2008) before declining to Rs.1,45,200 crore on July 25, 2008.      Financial markets reflected the changes in liquidity conditions during the first quarter of 2008-09.       Yields in the Government securities market hardened substantially during the current financial year in both primary and secondary segments.      Deposit rates of SCBs increased, particularly at the longer end of the maturity spectrum, during the first four months of 2008-09 (up to July 25).      The equity markets witnessed a major downturn in both the primary and secondary segments during the current financial year so far, continuing the moderation that had set in by early January 2008.       Commercial banks holdings of Government and other approved securities was 27.7 per cent of the banking systems net demand and time liabilities (NDTL) which was marginally lower than 27.8 per cent at end-March 2008 and 28.7 per cent a year ago.       Gross market borrowings of the Central Government through dated securities at Rs.72,000 crore (Rs.73,000 crore a year ago) during 2008-09 so far (up to July 25, 2008), constituted 41.0 per cent of the budget estimates (BE) whereas net market borrowings at Rs.47,982 crore (Rs.45,232 crore a year ago) constituted 48.5 per cent of the BE.      External Developments       Information released by the DGCI&amp;amp;amp;S indicates that exports increased by 21.7 per cent in US dollar terms during the first two months of the current financial year, as compared with 24.2 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. Imports rose by 31.8 per cent as compared with 37.9 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year.       While non-POL imports moderated to 24.6 per cent from 43.8 per cent a year ago, POL imports increased by 48.6 per cent on account of the surge in crude oil prices as compared with 25.7 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. As a result, the merchandise trade deficit widened to US $ 20.7 billion during April-May 2008 from US $ 13.9 billion in the corresponding period last year.       reign exchange reserves declined marginally by US $ 2.6 billion during the current financial year so far and stood at US $ 307.1 billion on July 18, 2008.       During the current financial year up to July 25, 2008 the rupee depreciated by 5.4 per cent against the US dollar, by 5.0 per cent against the euro, by 5.2 per cent against the pound sterling and by 1.3 per cent against the Japanese yen.       Global Developments       According to the update of World Economic Outlook (WEO) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) released in July 2008, global real GDP growth on a purchasing power parity basis is expected to decelerate from 5.0 per cent in 2007 to 4.1 per cent in 2008 (3.7 per cent in WEO, April 2008) and further to 3.9 per cent in 2009 (3.8 per cent in WEO, April 2008).        Inflation has become a global phenomenon in recent months. Inflation pressures have raised serious concerns in emerging market economies (EMEs) across Asia, Latin America and Africa, mainly on account of supply-demand imbalances in food, fuel and commodity markets.       Prices of crude oil, which have rebounded since July 2007, increased by 60.0 per cent up to July 25, 2008 from their level a year ago. World oil markets have been particularly tight during the first half of 2008, with year-on-year growth in world oil consumption outstripping growth in non-Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) production by over 1 million barrels per day.        In the global financial markets, sentiment has been adversely affected by concerns relating to a deep and prolonged recession in the US, somewhat alleviated by recent data on consumer sentiment, durable goods orders, consumer spending and oil prices. In addition, losses to the financial sector continue to mount in addition to rising debtdefaults.        Central banks have continued to work together and to consult regularly on liquidity conditions in financial markets.      The confluence of slowdown in growth and mounting inflation alongside financial vulnerabilities has complicated the task of monetary authorities across the world and rendered the future direction of policy setting highly uncertain.       Some central banks that have tightened their policy rates in the recent months include the ECB; the Reserve Bank of Australia; Bank Indonesia; Bank of Thailand; the Banco Central de Chile; Banco Central do Brasil  and Banco de Mexico.       Overall Assessment      Domestically, aggregate demand pressures appear to be strongly in evidence, exacerbate...
