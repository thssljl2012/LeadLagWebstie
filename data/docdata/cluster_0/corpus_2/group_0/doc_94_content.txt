What facts do you have to offer?                Quote:                         Look at how well your economic theories have worked so far.                     you must be kidding.        Is Australia better off now due to market reforms by Howard and Keating?      of course it is.           Quote:                          In case you didn&amp;#039;t notice, a large proportion of Australians are immigrants who have struggled their whole lives with nothing much from week to week other than their wage.                     I have noticed which is why I am so stronly against non skilled migration.              Quote:                         The pension has not increased for 10 years.                     ????????????      The CPI has been an important economic indicator for many years and actions related to movements in it have had direct or indirect effects on all Australians. It is now provides a general measure of price inflation for the household sector as a whole and is used by the Reserve Bank of Australia as the official measure of inflation for evaluating monetary policy. In the past it has been used as a starting point by parties to the national wage hearings and by the Industrial Relations Commission in determining the size and nature of wage adjustments.  The CPI has also been used in recent years in the indexation of pension and superannuation payments (that is, the pension or payment is automatically adjusted, or &amp;#039;indexed&amp;#039;, using movements in the CPI).  Many business contracts are regularly adjusted to take account of changes on the CPI or in some components of it. Rental agreements, insurance coverages and child support payments are frequently tied in some manner to changes in the CPI.       http://www.pss.gov.au/tools/pensioners/cpi.html           How the Consumer Price Index (CPI) affects your pension    On the first payday in January and July each year, your pension is increased only if there has been an upward movement in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the preceding six months. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) measures changes over time in the prices of a wide range of consumer goods and services acquired by Australian metropolitan households to determine the CPI.
