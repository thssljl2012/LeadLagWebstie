           Advertisements [ ? ]                         Half-priced oil by end of year?  The drop in energy prices has eased fears of prolonged sticker shock, and some say oil may hit $70 a barrel from a high of $145.  By JAD MOUAWAD, New York Times  Last update: July 29, 2008 - 10:27 PM   The sharp drop in energy prices since the beginning of the month is turning into a rare bright spot in a bleak economic landscape.  For the moment, at least, fears of a prolonged energy shock seem to have subsided a bit.  Oil has fallen more than $23 a barrel, or 16 percent, since peaking July 3. Gasoline has slipped below $4 a gallon and is dropping fast as Americans drive less. Natural gas prices, which had risen the fastest this year as traders anticipated a hot summer, have shed 33 percent since the beginning of the month.  Crude oil prices extended their decline, falling 2.5 percent, to $122.19 a barrel, their lowest level since the beginning of May. This helped spur a rally in the stock market, with all major indexes rising more than 2 percent. But stock markets still remain close to the lows of earlier this month.  It comes after an equally sharp correction in the prices of many agricultural commodities such as corn, wheat and rice, which took place a few weeks ago. These moves suggest to economists that global markets, in a near-panic early this year to find prices high enough to allocate scarce supplies, overshot and bid prices too high.  Commodity prices remain extraordinarily high by historical standards. But with the economy weakening amid a housing crisis and a credit crunch that show few signs of improving, many traders have begun to believe demand for oil and other commodities will soften worldwide.  Investors became net sellers in the oil market last week for the first time since mid-February 2007, according to Barclays Capital.  more...   http://www.startribune.com/business/26082769.html                         ...
