Ballooning Commodities    Like bear markets and recessions, financial bubbles are easier to recognize than to define precisely. Roughly speaking, they are characterized by the price of something rising much more quickly than its cost of production&amp;amp;#8230;   The S&amp;amp;P GSCI commodities index is up 73% in the past 12 months.  The price of iron ore in the benchmark Chinese contract will be 90% higher this year than last. In a world where economic growth is slowing in many places, these increases look out of kilter&amp;amp;#8230;.  The best evidence is the rapid increase in investment funds dedicated to this asset class -- to $220 billion from $70 billion in the past three years, according to Barclays...  What about commodity production costs? They also have been rising -- something like 10% to 15% annually. That is a lot slower than the 31% average annual increase in the GSCI index the past five years. A good portion of the cost increase comes from the higher commodity prices themselves&amp;amp;#8230;.  Readily available money turns a small imbalance between supply and demand into huge price increases. That is because of a basic rule of markets: The price keeps rising until enough buyers walk away to bring the market into balance. Oil at $60 and $100 a barrel didn&amp;#039;t do the trick. Perhaps $150 will. It is a matter of both psychology -- when buyers say, &amp;amp;quot;That&amp;#039;s just too much&amp;amp;quot; -- and the availability of funds. Right now, it looks like the monetary variable is the crucial one. The desire for more commodities is strongest where growth is fastest -- particularly China and other fast-growing Asian countries. Most of these countries have lots of dollars from running large trade surpluses. They are using those funds to bid up prices.
