Off topic a bit, but shazam....i am sure some kiwis  thought they could only go up...... i thinks they  need to cut rates.....all sounds very familar yet  worse...        July 11 (Bloomberg) -- Sales of New Zealand houses  slumped for a fourth straight month in June as  record-high interest rates curtailed demand for  property.          The number of homes sold dropped 42.4 percent to  4,305 from 7,474 a year earlier, according to a  report from the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand  Inc. e-mailed to Bloomberg News today. Sales were at  the lowest level since December 1991.          A cooling real estate market and rising debt levels  are eroding the spending power of consumers, and may  have pushed the economy into a recession. Reserve  Bank Governor Alan Bollard last month said it is  likely he will cut the benchmark interest rate from a  record-high 8.25 percent later this year as slowing  domestic demand eases pressure on inflation.          ``Households are coming under financial pressure  from all fronts,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Nick Tuffley, chief economist  at ASB Bank Ltd. in Auckland. ``The Reserve Bank will  continue to expect further weakness in the housing  market, given that the imbalance between supply and  demand remains.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;          Investors are deferring decisions on buying or  selling until a clearer trend emerges, the institute  said. Lower prices are being accepted to complete  faster sales.          ``There isn&amp;#039;t a lot of confidence in the residential  property market,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Murray Cleland, the institute&amp;#039;s  national president, said in a statement. Still, ``the  market is finding its own level and there is  certainly no indication of any significant slump in  values.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;            http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=2...
