  SINGAPORE - Oil held above $145 a barrel Tuesday in Asia as a series of threats to supply in a finely balanced market continues to keep a floor under prices.  &amp;quot;The oil market right now is fundamentally tight, which is why prices have been high and volatile,&amp;quot; said David Moore, a commodity strategist with Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.  In late afternoon trading in Singapore, light, sweet crude for August delivery was up 18 cents at $145.36 a barrel in Asian electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  The contract rose 10 cents in Monday&amp;#039;s floor session to $145.18 a barrel, just over a dime short of the all-time settlement high.  ....  On Monday, U.S. President George W. Bush lifted an executive ban on offshore oil drilling. That alone is not expected to loosen global supplies in the short term since a Congressional prohibition remains in place and any new wells would take years to complete.   http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/oil_prices
