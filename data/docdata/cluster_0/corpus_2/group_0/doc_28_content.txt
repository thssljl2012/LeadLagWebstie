 LONDON, July 29 (Reuters) - European shares ended higher on Tuesday, snapping a three-day losing streak after data showed a rise in U.S. consumer confidence, though banks limited gains due to worries over more writedowns linked to a credit crisis.  The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares provisionally closed 0.4 percent higher at 1,163.24 points, also helped by a cooling off in oil prices.  Earlier, a higher-than-expected reading on the U.S. consumer sentiment index helped bring about a turnaround for European shares, which fell as much as 1.3 percent earlier in the day.  The consumer index came in at 51.9 for July --the first rise since December -- from an upwardly revised 51.0 in June, which was the lowest since a reading of 47.3 in February 1992.  &amp;quot;This confirms a similar reading by the University of Michigan last Friday. Both have seen a severe weakness of late and this bounce indicates that, perhaps, consumer confidence has bottomed out,&amp;quot; said Bernard McAlinden, market strategist at NCB Stockbrokers in Dublin.  &amp;quot;It is good news, but only at the margins,&amp;quot; he added.  Banks remained a prominent negative weight on the FTSEurofirst 300, with investors spooked by a shock writedown from Merrill Lynch (MER.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) overnight.  The DJStoxx European banks was down 0.5 percent, with UBS UBSN.VX&amp;amp;gt; losing 3.6 percent, Barclays dropping 4.1 percent and BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) down 1.8 percent. The banking index lost as much as 3.6 percent earlier in the session.  /.  http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idCAL9714501...
