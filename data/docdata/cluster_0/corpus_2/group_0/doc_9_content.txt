           Nymex crude breaches USD143/bbl    30 Jun 2008 10:15 am         New York - Crude oil futures reached over USD143 on Thursday for the first time as the dollar weakened and rhetoric from Libya sparked supply fears.       Light, sweet crude for August delivery settled USD5.09, or 3.8 per cent, higher at USD140.64 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures hit an all-time intraday record high of USD140.39 in an electronic session following the close of floor trading.       Settlement prices for Brent crude on the ICE futures exchange were unavailable.       Like many similar moves before it, Thursday&amp;#039;s surge in oil prices used ambivalence over the Federal Reserve&amp;#039;s future actions and a weakening dollar as a launching pad.       While equity and credit markets have languished, oil futures are up 45 per cent so far this year and more than double what they were a year ago. Crude oil&amp;#039;s ascent Thursday was accompanied by precious metals such as gold, which were also rising on the perception that the Fed isn&amp;#039;t as eager to raise interest rates as was earlier believed.       After selling off on Wednesday following data showing an unexpected increase in U.S. inventories, oil futures regained strength as the euro hit a three-week high against the dollar.       Crude also got a leg up after Libya threatened an output cut. Shokri Ghanem, chief of Libya&amp;#039;s national oil company, reiterated his Sunday comments that Libya &amp;amp;quot;sees a possibility for a decrease in production,&amp;amp;quot; according to Bloomberg News.       Libya, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries whose current crude oil output is around 1.8 million barrels a day, considers that the oil market is saturated.       Christopher Mennis, president of New Wave Energy, an energy brokerage based in Aptos, Calif., downplayed the remarks, saying any price moves based on them were an overreaction.       &amp;amp;quot;It was a puff comment, the Libyans aren&amp;#039;t going to cut production,&amp;amp;quot; he said.       Libya&amp;#039;s comments come days after Saudi Arabia, the world&amp;#039;s largest oil exporter and de-facto leader of OPEC, said it would boost output as well as its oil production capacity.       &amp;amp;quot;The market really needs that oil,&amp;amp;quot; said Kevin Norrish, head of commodities research at Barclays Capital. &amp;amp;quot;The extra oil can fairly comfortably be absorbed (by refiners). The market remains vulnerable to supply shocks.&amp;amp;quot;       OPEC isn&amp;#039;t considering a group move to drop production, a delegate from the group told Dow Jones Newswires.       &amp;amp;quot;We will discuss (any change in output) in September at the next meeting,&amp;amp;quot; the delegate said.       While some analysts say Saudi Arabia&amp;#039;s output boost may cause friction in OPEC, other members of the cartel are unlikely to cut production.       &amp;amp;quot;They&amp;#039;re loving these high prices and they&amp;#039;re not going to give up a drop,&amp;amp;quot; said Mennis.       Front-month July reformulated-gasoline blendstock settled 11.72 cents higher, or 3.5 per cent, at USD3.5113 a gallon. July heating oil settled 13.42 cents higher, or 3.6 per cent, at USD3.8834 a gallon.
