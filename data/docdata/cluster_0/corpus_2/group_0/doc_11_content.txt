The bank said the full damage from the global banking  crisis would take another year to unfold.          Rob McAdie, Barclays&amp;#039; credit strategist, said: &amp;amp;quot;The  core issues have not been addressed. We&amp;#039;re still in a  very large deleveraging cycle and we&amp;#039;re seeing losses  continue to mount. We think smaller banks will  struggle to raise capital. We&amp;#039;re very bearish - in  the long-term - on high-yield debt. The default rate  will reach 8pc to 9pc next  year.&amp;amp;quot;        He said investors had taken their eye off the  slow-motion disaster engulfing the US bond insurers  or &amp;amp;quot;monolines&amp;amp;quot;. Together these firms guarantee $170bn  of structured credit and $1,000bn of US municipal  bonds.        The two leaders - MBIA and Ambac - have already been  downgraded as the rating agencies belatedly turn  stringent. The risk is further downgrades could set  off a fresh wave of bank troubles. &amp;amp;quot;The  creditworthiness of many US financial institutions  will decline in coming months,&amp;amp;quot; he  said.        The bank warned that engineering and auto firms  we&amp;#039;re likely to face a crunch as steel and oil costs  surge. &amp;amp;quot;Their business models will have to be  substantially altered if they are going to survive,&amp;amp;quot;  said Mr  McAdie.        A small chorus of City bankers dissent from the view  that inflation is the chief danger in the US and  other rich OECD countries. The teams at Socit  Gnrale, Dresdner Kleinwort, and Banque AIG all warn  that deflation may loom as housing markets crumble  under record levels of household  debt.        Bernard Connolly, global startegist at Banque AIG,  said inflation targeting by central banks had become  a &amp;amp;quot;totemism that threatens to crush the world  economy&amp;amp;quot;.        He said it would be madness to throw millions out of  work by deflating part of the economy to offset a  rise in imported fuel and food prices. Real wages are  being squeezed by oil, come what may. It may be  healthier for society to let it happen  gently.        _____________________________________________________ _____________                Information appearing on telegraph.co.uk is the  copyright of Telegraph Media Group Limited and must  not be reproduced in any medium without licence.
