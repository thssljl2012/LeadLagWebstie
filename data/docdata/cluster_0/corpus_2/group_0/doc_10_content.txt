Natural Gas Futures Advance After Crude Oil Surges to  Record          June 30 (Bloomberg) -- Natural gas futures in New  York rose to the highest in more than two years,  after crude oil advanced to a record.           U.S. natural gas inventories in the week ended June  20 were 382 billion cubic feet, or 16 percent, below  a year earlier.          Natural gas for August delivery rose 15.3 cents, or  1.2 percent, to $13.351 per million British thermal  units at 10:45 a.m. on the New York Mercantile  Exchange. Gas earlier touched $13.448 per million  Btu, the highest since Dec. 22, 2005.          Natural gas has risen 97 percent in the past year,  lifted by crude&amp;#039;s rise. Oil has almost doubled in the  same period on expectations of possible supply  shortfalls and investor demand for commodities to  hedge against a weaker dollar.          Declining imports of gas from Canada and reduced  supplies of liquefied natural gas have spurred  speculation of a possible supply crunch and higher  prices next winter, when demand peaks.          `The overall bullish story on natural gas hasn&amp;#039;t  gone away,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said George Hopley, an analyst at  Barclays Capital Inc. in New York. ``It&amp;#039;s not going  to go away. Typically, it&amp;#039;s the weeks after July 4th  that start to ramp down the rate of injections.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;          Heating Supplies          Hopley expects stored supplies of gas will end the  U.S. inventory restocking period in early November at  around 3.3 trillion cubic feet, which is near the  five-year average.          The flow of LNG into the U.S. this year will  probably be about 30 percent less than the 770  billion cubic feet recorded in 2007, the Energy  Department said June 10. LNG shipments last year  helped send stockpiles to a record 3.545 trillion  cubic feet by November.          Increased prices for gas in Europe and Asia have  diverted cargoes from the U.S. so far this year, a  trend Hopley doesn&amp;#039;t expect to be reversed. Shipments  may rise later this year, pushing the average to 1.5  billion cubic feet a day compared with 2.1 billion in  2007, he said.          ``We&amp;#039;re going to be well below 2007; no one&amp;#039;s base  case is that we&amp;#039;ll match that,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Hopley said.          U.K. gas for delivery next month traded at 73.20  pence a therm today, according to Spectron Group Ltd.  That&amp;#039;s equal to $14.59 per million Btu. U.K. gas for  delivery in the three months starting January was the  equivalent of $21.78 per million Btu compared with  $14.112 for the same period in New York.          Higher oil prices have also made natural gas cheaper  on a relative basis, prompting those seeking a  bargain to buy.          On an energy-equivalency basis, oil used to heat  buildings and run power plants traded at a premium to  gas in New York of about 75 percent on June 27,  according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
