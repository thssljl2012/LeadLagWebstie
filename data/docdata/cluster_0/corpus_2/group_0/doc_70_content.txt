SYDNEY (Thomson Financial) - The U.S dollar was mixed against major currencies in midmorning trade in Sydney on Tuesday    ahead of the release of producer price data which is expected to show that some inflationary    pressures remain in the U.S. economy.    But the market remains divided about the Federal Reserve&amp;#039;s resolve to fight inflationary pressures when the U.S. economy is tethering on the edge of recession.    At 0025 GMT, the dollar was at 106.11 yen, compared to 106.18 yen in late trade in New York    on Monday while the euro was at $1.5896, down from $1.5910.    John Noonan, a senior foreign exchange analyst at Thomsom Reuters IFR Markets, said support for the U.S. currency might be eroded by a perception that the Federal Reserve might not make inflation a high priority due to concerns about the state of the financial sector.    &amp;#039;The perception in the market is that the Fed will not be able to tackle inflation pressures while the banking/financial sector is under this kind of pressure,&amp;#039; Noonan said.    He said the Federal Reserve could be seen as falling &amp;#039;behind the inflation curve&amp;#039; which could be    negative for the dollar.    Noonan said the market will be focussed on Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke&amp;#039;s testimony before Congress later Tuesday where Bernanke will be surely be asked how he sees the end-game to the deepening credit crisis and will likely try to be reassuring.    &amp;#039;Unfortunately investors and the market at large have heard reassuring words from the Fed and Treasury in the past, like mid-2006 when both gave assurances that the subprime crisis will be and was being contained,:&amp;#039; Noonan said.    NAB Capital Markets head of currency strategy John Kyriakopoulos said it was hard to see much recovery in the dollar unless financial stocks rebound on perception that the credit crunch is easing.    Kyriakopoulos said the dollar index has broken below a rising trend line support from a Bear Stearns-inspired low in mid-March, which is good reason to be cautious in the near term.    He said there is a 25 percent chance that the Australian dollar could reach parity with its U.S. counterpart though that may require another rate hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia.    More insight into Australia&amp;#039;s central bank thinking will be provided later this morning with the release of the minutes of the policymakers&amp;#039; July 3 meeting.
