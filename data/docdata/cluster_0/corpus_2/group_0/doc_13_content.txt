         ENRC is Barclays share of the week citing its  - strong track record and an experienced management team  - conveniently placed geography &amp;amp;#8211;  Kazakhstan shares a border with both Russia and China, two of the fastest-growing commodity markets in the world.    - growth prospects -  $2.5 billion pipeline of new projects. We expect the group to quadruple its cash flow between now and 2012, from around $500 million this year to around $2 billion in four years&amp;amp;#8217; time.   - defensive qualities -  More than 80% of its profits come from defensive commodities such as ferrochrome and iron ore. The prices of these are much more stable than base metals like copper and zinc, making it an attractive place to be during volatile times.    Current share price is 1,000p and DigitalLook (which may not be accurate) has forward EPS at 121.96p (2008) and 166.88p (2009) put it on an attractive 2009 P/E of 6.0.  Barclays have a price target of 1625p on the stock and believe its valuation is compelling. It trades a significant discount to Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton.  SteMiS [Not a holder]
