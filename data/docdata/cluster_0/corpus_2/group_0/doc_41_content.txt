  Zinc prices could slide to USD 1.05 per long ton in 2008 Purchasing.com reported that too many zinc mining andsmelting operations worldwide have caused the supply pipeline for zincto be more than plentiful.  The International Lead Zinc Study Group projects a zinc surplus thisyear of 215,000 tonne. Mr Gayle Berry analyst at Barclays CapitalResearch in London said that with Junes US zinc price at 90, theanalysts see USD 1.05 as the probable full year average for 2008. Theforecast average for 2009 also is USD 1.05 because analysts such asBart Melek at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto sees no chance demand willoutpace supply anytime soon.  Another Toronto based mining analyst, Mr Kerry Smith at HaywoodSecurities said that production is fragmented among a large number ofcompanies, with the biggest, Xstrata at 800,000 ton per year,controlling only 7% of supply. Even this years merger of Zinifex withOxiana that created OZ Minerals only gives the Melbourne firm controlof 6% of world supply.  In a recent interview with Platts Metals Daily.com, Mr Smith said thatYou never see much producer discipline in the zinc market. If pricescome down and a mine starts losing money, you dont often see itshutting down production because nobody else follows suit. He saidthat whats more, a company with a profit-draining mine still facescosts associated with a shutdown, such as holding costs, environmentalexpenses and worker severance pay. He added that So even if the mineis losing a little money, its sometimes better to keep it operatingthan to shut down due to these costs.  Recently, 29 small to medium size Chinese firms with total zincsmelting capacity of around 900,000 tonne per year accounting for 20%of total Chinese zinc smelting capacity met in Shanghai to discusscutting production by 10% due to tight power supply in 2008. However, aMacquarie Research Commodities report said that the proposed productioncut appears unlikely, since it lacks the support of bigger Chineseproducers.
