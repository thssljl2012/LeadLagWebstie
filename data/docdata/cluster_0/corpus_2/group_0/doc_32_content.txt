 As London swelters in the summer heat, the FTSE looks to have taken an early holiday this week on a tight ranging, low volume trading day. Most major indices are mixed to negative after a light weekend news flow. In the US two more banks were taken over by the FDIC, First National Bank of Nevada and First Heritage Bank, N.A., but this caused few ripples of excitement across global markets. It is a busy economic calendar this week, but much of the action happens in the latter half of the week with earnings from RBS and Barclays and US payroll figures on Friday. A modest rebound in commodities led by oil has put miners and energy stocks at the forefront, but momentum and volume is relatively weak across the board in either direction.
