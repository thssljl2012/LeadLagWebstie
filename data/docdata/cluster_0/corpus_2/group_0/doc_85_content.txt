 The Fair Pay Commission raised the federal minimum wage by $21.66 a week, providing some relief for 1.3 million lower-paid workers who are struggling under higher fuel and food prices.      The standard federal minimum wage moved up to $14.31 per hour from $13.74 last year, bringing the weekly rate to $543.78 from $522.12, starting from October.      The 4.14% increase is less than the 4.3% sought by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, but well above the more modest increase sought by the business community fearful of a wage price-setting spiral being set off by rising wages.      AFPC chairman Ian Harper announced the pay rise in Melbourne today, saying  the wage rise, when combined with relevant tax and social security changes, would provide low-income households with real increases in disposable income.      &amp;amp;quot;It is a decision that takes into account the state of the national economy and the circumstances of low-paid Australians,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.      Professor Harper said the commission was aware of the financial pressures impacting on low income households.      &amp;amp;quot;Movements in consumer prices, in particular, have put many low-income households under considerable financial stress,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.      The ACTU praised the decision, using it as an opportunity to press for a further dismantling of industrial relations changes made during John Howard&amp;#039;s government.      &amp;amp;quot;Today&amp;#039;s decision is a small step towards repairing the damage caused to the wages and conditions of the most vulnerable members of the workforce under WorkChoices,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; ACTU secretary Jeff Lawrence said in a statement.      The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which sought an increase in the area of $10 a week, called the increase &amp;amp;quot;economically risky.&amp;amp;quot;      Peter Anderson, chief executive of ACCI, said in a statement that the increase was likely to fuel inflation.      &amp;amp;quot;The Australian Fair Pay Commission has underplayed the impact of recent economic developments, including interest rate increases and fuel price volatility, on the businesses which must apply this wage increase,&amp;amp;quot; Mr Anderson said.      Fighting inflation has become a chief activity of the Reserve Bank of Australia in recent months, as the central bank seeks a sustainable level of economic growth amid surging global commodities prices and a tight labour market.      Economist Burchell Wilson of 4Cast said &amp;amp;quot;a key driver of inflation is always wages&amp;amp;quot;.      &amp;amp;quot;In an industrial relations environment like Australia&amp;#039;s, roughly 20% of wages are directly determined by awards decisions,&amp;amp;quot; he said.      The wage rise will have a &amp;amp;quot;concertina&amp;amp;quot; effect on the official wage rate, Mr Wilson said.      Markets tend to ignore the impact of the Pay Commission&amp;#039;s decision until the higher wages are felt in the economy, he said.      &amp;amp;quot;The financial markets tend to wait for things to hit them in the face,&amp;amp;quot; he said.       http://business.smh.com.au/wage-boos...0708-39kq.html
