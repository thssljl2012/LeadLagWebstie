Paul we both say that BARC goes up.    159 or low sixties.  I made this predicton on Friday and discussions since and the candlestick chart show a likely positive start, plus there's also the new initiative from Obama.    On the negative side, the Dow finished slightly below water on Friday.    Look to Asia tomorrow and the Nikkei, Hang Seng and Kospi should provide good indicators to a the digestion of the US initiatives.    Of course, it is only a prediction so it could be tosh!!
