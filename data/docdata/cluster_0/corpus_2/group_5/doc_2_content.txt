We are asking for a big drop in iron ore   prices.   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Chinas demands would be more severe than the 50 percent   price cut that Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. has   forecast for producers Cia. Vale do Rio Doce, Rio Tinto and BHP   Billiton Ltd. All Chinese steelmakers were unprofitable in   October as exports and demand from carmakers and builders   slumped, the countrys association said.   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Its going to be a difficult price negotiation as miners   and mills are divided in the market outlook, said Helen Lau, a   Shanghai-based analyst with Daiwa Securities Group Inc. But   iron ore prices are determined by demand, not steel prices. The   associations comment is part of negotiating tactics.   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Benchmark contract iron ore fines sold by Rio Tinto, the   second-largest supplier, this year cost around $92.58 a metric   ton, and it was sold at around $16.685 a ton in 1994, according   to Bloomberg calculations. Pushing iron ore prices back to 1994   levels to pace the decline in steel prices in China would mean   an 82 percent decline.    &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; First Cut    &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Miners profit should be pegged to the steelmakers, the   associations Shan said. Steel exports and exports of steel-   made machines and other goods account for 25 percent of Chinas   steel output. The exports are unlikely to recover next year.   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; An iron ore price cut in 2009 would be the first in seven   years. Prices jumped as much as 97 percent for the year started   April 1. Merrill Lynch &amp;amp;amp; Co. said Dec. 5 that prices may drop 20   percent next year and BHP may have to cut output by 25 percent.   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Vale, Rio and BHP account for three quarters of seaborne   traded iron ore. Rio and BHP ship the material from mines in   Australia and Vale, the largest supplier, from Brazil.   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Chinese steelmakers want the new annual pricing to start   from Jan. 1, 2009, instead of from April, and want the prices to   be set more frequently rather than on an annual basis, the   associations Shan said.   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Its the reality that current contracts cannot be   fulfilled, Shan said. Many bigger mills dont need to import   till the end of March, some even the end of May.   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Chinas iron ore stockpiles at its major ports and   warehouses have exceeded a record 100 million tons, he said.    &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Cut Output    &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Nanjing Iron &amp;amp;amp; Steel United Co., Maanshan Iron &amp;amp;amp; Steel Co.   and other Chinese mills have delayed iron ore imports. London-   based Rio Tinto said in November it cut annual output by 10   percent.   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; No buyer wanted to build stocks ahead of April 1 price   cuts, said Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts led by Jim Lennon.   Demand for the ore remains chronically weak, he said today.   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Steel demand in China wont rebound until at least the   second quarter next year even with the government stimulus   package, the steel associations Shan said.   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; The market improvement may take a longer time, Shan   said. Its even tough work to keep next years demand at this   years level.   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; China unveiled a 4 trillion yuan ($581 billion) stimulus   plan, investing in housing, roads, railways and airports to try   to bolster sagging growth in the worlds fourth-largest economy.   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Lakshmi Mittal, chief executive officer of ArcelorMittal,   the worlds largest steelmaker, said Dec. 5 steel demand may   rebound next year and the company wouldnt deepen output cuts.   The Luxemburg-based company has reduced output by about a third   and slashed staff to cope with the global recession.
