         It has been said since the Merrill merger. Now it is official:   Bank of America Corp said on Thursday it plans to eliminate 30,000 to 35,000 jobs over three years after it completes its purchase of Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co.  The cuts could affect about 11 percent of the combined companies' roughly 308,000-person workforce.    http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20081211/bs_nm/us_bankofamerica_3...   As the ranks of the unemployed grow, OPEC is starting to rumble too:   News that Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev said the country was ready to work with OPEC on possible oil output cuts lent additional support to the market.  &amp;quot;We are starting to see the real engine for lifting oil prices, cuts in OPEC production, and it seems likely they will cut production at their meeting next week,&amp;quot; said Tim Evans, energy analyst for Citi Futures Perspective.   Besides the obvious irony of a Citi analyst making this call, you would think that the oil market would firm, not go up 10%, with production cuts on the way. Demand is going to shrink with a worldwide recession. Supply is probably going to increase as oil nations try to get as much hard currency (Boy, is that an oxymoron!) as they can. OPEC cheating is legend and, with so many countries having internal problems, there is more incentive now to cheat than ever before. People in oil countries probably remember that oil was $27 a barrel as recently as 2003. Why cut supply when oil can fetch $48 or even $40? &amp;quot;Make money while you can&amp;quot; will be their cry; not &amp;quot;cut production and hope that prices rise.&amp;quot;  As the job losses mount, I find it interesting that the President (not the President-elect) isn't out doing a pep-talk. Maybe the President's pep has done popped.  W.D.
