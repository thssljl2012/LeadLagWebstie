Market Update 081223 http://biz.yahoo.com/mu/update.html 4:15 pm : A lack of leadership prompted participants to send the stock market lower in another thinly traded session. Trading volume remains light ahead of the Dec. 25 holiday. Less than 1 billion shares were exchanged on the NYSE this session. That is the least volume in a full trading day since August. Stocks actually opened with broad-based gains, advancing as much as 1.0%. Those gains quickly turned into losses, though, as sellers entered the ring, focusing much of their effort on the financial sector. Financials were up as much as 1.2%, but finished the session 1.9% lower as the worst performing economic sector. The sector's weakness was largely attributable to diversified financial players, which will still be facing formidable obstacles in 2009. Bank of America (BAC 12.76, -0.77) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM 29.14, -0.68) traded as laggards, and also weighed on the Dow. Goldman Sachs (GS 75.34, -1.66) and Morgan Stanley (MS 14.44, -0.14) also finished lower. Analysts at JPMorgan lowered their earnings estimates for Goldman, but raised their estimates for Morgan Stanley. Concern continues to surround automakers. Standard &amp; Poor's lowered the unsecured debt rating of General Motors (GM 3.01, -0.51) to C from CC, even though the government plans to provide GM with financing. Meanwhile, Moody's lowered Ford's (F 2.19, -0.40) credit rating to Caa3. Economic data did little to entice buyers into the market. The latest batch of home sales remained weak. November new home sales declined 2.9% to an annualized rate of 407,000 units, which is the lowest level in 17 years. The consensus forecast called for new home sales of 415,000. November existing home sales declined 8.6% to an annualized rate of 4.49 million units, which is worse than the already-depressed levels seen in recent months. The consensus called for 4.93 million sales. Final third quarter GDP data came without major surprise. The economy contracted at an annualized rate of 0.5%, which is unchanged from the prior reading. The personal consumption component was down 3.8%, while the core personal consumption component was up 2.4%. Economists expected the consumption levels to remain unchanged from the prior reading at -3.7% and +2.6%, respectively. European exchanges closed with mixed results. Britain's FTSE finished 0.2% higher as its investors overcame news that the economy officially slipped 0.6% during the third quarter. British banks were key in the advance. Banks and financial companies in Germany helped limit weakness in the DAX, which fell 0.2%. France's CAC lagged, closing 0.7% lower. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index closed 2.8% lower in the wake of yesterday's loss warning from Toyota Motor (TM 60.36, -0.52). The fact China cut its benchmark rate by a less-than-expected 27 basis points to 5.31% also weighed on sentiment. The Hang Seng shed 2.8% as developers and banks showed weakness. Japan's markets were closed for holiday observance. DJ30 -100.82 NASDAQ -10.81 NQ100 -0.5% R2K -1.4% SP400 -0.9% SP500 -8.48 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 984/1.31 bln/1835 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 1205/984 mln/1886 3:30 pm : Crude oil closed roughly 3.3% lower at $38.58 per barrel. Oil futures had been down 5.3% when they set a session low of $37.79 per barrel. Crude actually traded higher, though only for a bit. Its session high was $40.65 per barrel. January natural gas had a strong session. It finished near its session high at $5.61, up 6.0%. Oil and natural gas inventory data are due tomorrow morning since the U.S. markets will be closed Dec. 25. February gold contracts slipped 1.6% to finish just below $834 per ounce. Gold actually closed near the middle of the session's trading range. Gold is trading with a modest gain year-to-date. Silver also slid. March silver contracts closed near $10.23 per ounce, which is roughly 5.8% lower. DJ30 -82.12 NASDAQ -9.77 SP500 -6.38 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 989/1.09 bln/1814 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 1243/738 mln/1838 3:00 pm : Stocks have fallen to new session lows amid renewed selling pressure. All 10 of the major economic sectors are now in the red; seven of the sectors are trading with losses of at least 1%. Utilities (-1.7%) are the worst performing sector of the bunch, and have been for virtually the entire session. The sector's weakness is largely specific to electric utilities players. On the other hand, nuclear generator Exelon (EXC 51.55, +0.14) is providing modest support to the sector. DJ30 -99.40 NASDAQ -16.26 SP500 -9.02 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 924/976 mln/1864 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 1139/657 mln/1936 2:30 pm : Stocks are slowly drifting back toward the unchanged mark but pervasive weakness continues to restrain the move. Only a handful of trading sessions remain before 2008 draws to a close. Many investors will be happy to put the year behind them. Year-to-date, the S&amp;P 500 has fallen more than 40%. The Dow has dropped 36% this year. The Nasdaq is down more than 42% year-to-date. Financials remain the worst performing economic sector. Financials have lost nearly 60% of their worth this fiscal year.DJ30 -33.45 NASDAQ -8.78 SP500 -2.21 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1024/883 mln/1760 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 1312/593 mln/1742 2:00 pm : Stocks are making a pronounced upward turn after trading in a relatively narrow range during the last hour. Energy has made its way back into the green, reversing its decline as oil pares its losses. Energy was down as much as 1.0%, but is now up 0.7%. Oil futures were down as much as 5.3%, but are now down 1.0% to $39.50 per barrel.DJ30 -24.53 NASDAQ -7.40 SP500 -1.60 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 986/807 mln/1748 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 1271/538 mln/1780 1:30 pm : Action remains listless, and the stock market has begun to trade in a relatively narrow range. Stocks are still showing losses, though, as nearly 70% of the holdings in the S&amp;P 500 are trading lower. Weakness has extended into commodities. The CRB Commodity Index is down 0.3%. Oil has shed 2.5% to trade just below $39 per barrel. Gold was recently indicated at $835 per ounce, down 1.3%. Treasuries are also finding little action. The 10-year Note is up just one tick. DJ30 -46.83 NASDAQ -8.76 SP500 -4.51 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 986/741 mln/1725 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 1184/492 mln/1855 1:00 pm : After opening the session with solid gains the stock market turned lower midsession as sellers entered the fold. Stocks traded as much as 1.0% higher, but a wave of selling knocked stocks lower. Stocks are currently down 0.4%, a bit off their session low. With a holiday just a few days ahead, trading has been thin, which means there is little conviction behind the market's moves. Roughly 450 million shares have traded hands on the NYSE so far this session. A lack of tradable headlines has also kept many investors on the sidelines. Early news items included word that Standard &amp; Poor's lowered the unsecured debt rating of General Motors (GM 2.98, -0.54) to C from CC. Meanwhile, Moody's lowered Ford's (F 2.18, -0.41) rating to Caa3. The latest batch of home sales was predictably weak. November new home sales declined 2.9% to an annualized rate of 407,000 units, which is the lowest level in 17 years. New home sales fell short of the consensus estimate of 415,000. Existing home sales for November declined 8.6% to an annualized rate of 4.49 million units, which is below recent averages. The consensus called for 4.93 million sales. Sluggish sales continue to keep inventory elevated, which puts downward pressure on prices. Lower prices along with the drop in mortgage rates should stimulate demand in coming months. Still, banks will first need to open their coffers to make the funds available. Weakness among financial stocks (-0.9%) factored into the broader market's downward move. The financial sector was up as much as 1.2% earlier, but continued weakness among major financial services companies has been a drag; diversified financial services companies are down 1.4%. Goldman Sachs (GS 75.44, -1.56) has traded as a laggard after analysts at JPMorgan trimmed their earnings estimates for the company. The analysts raised their estimates for Morgan Stanley (MS 14.73, +0.15), though. DJ30 -63.76 NASDAQ -11.62 SP500 -6.23 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 952/689 mln/1762 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 1128/456 mln/1908 12:30 pm : Stocks continue to trade with weakness. The largest declines are coming from the utilities (-1.4%) and financial (-1.0%) sectors. Only health care remains in positve ground. Advancers have a slight edge over decliners in the sector. Dow component Merck (MRK 29.65, +0.56) is providing leadership to the health care sector, as is Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY 23.45, +0.52).DJ30 -59.50 NASDAQ -10.52 SP500 -5.92 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1031/604 mln/1660 NYSE Adv/Vol/Dec 1159/403 mln/1847 12:00 pm : The major indices have fallen to their worst levels of the session as broad-based gains reverse into broad-based declines. Eight of the 10 economic sectors are now in the red. The only two sectors to trade with a gain, health care (+0.1%) and materials (+0.3%), are quickly losing ground, though. Considerable weakness continues to surround automakers after General Motors (GM 2.95, -0.57) and Ford (F 2.16, -0.43) had their credit ratings downgraded. Specifically, Standard and Poor's lowered GM's unsecured debt rating to C from CC. The revision takes into account the funds that are being made available from the U.S. government. Standard &amp; Poor's also indicated that it is unlikely to raise the credit ratings of the Big Three automakers in the near future. As for Ford, Moody's lowered the automaker's rating to Caa3 after considering the risk that Ford might have to restructure its balance sheet in order to achieve some of the same union concessions that GM or Chrysler may achieve as they reorganize their operations. Automakers have traded lower for two straight sessions. The group has dropped nearly 30% since the close of last week.DJ30 -39.27 NASDAQ -4.51 SP500 -3.90 NASDAQ Adv/Vol/Dec 1130/526 mln/1540 NYSE Adv/...
