 MUMBAI: ESPN STAR Sports (ESS) has bagged the exclusive broadcast rights to telecast FIFAs international football events, including the 2010 FIFA World Cup, in the Indian Sub-Continent.The deal is estimated at over $40 million. ESS edged out Ten Sports, owned by Dubai-based Taj Television, after a two-month long bidding process.The deal gives ESS exclusive rights to show over 275 international football games, including the 2010 FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Confederations Cup, both to be held for the first time on the African soil in South Africa.In addition, ESS will bring other premier FIFA World Cup events for men, women, youth, Futsal and Beach Soccer to fans in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Maldives, Bhutan and Nepal.ESS managing director Manu Sawhney said, We are extremely delighted to continue our partnership with FIFA with whom we share a very special relationship. This agreement is a testament to our commitment of building the game of football by presenting it in the most innovative and entertaining manner to millions of fans in the Indian Sub-Continent.ESPN Software India MD RC Venkateish said, ESS has played a key role in propagating international soccer in India and the results have begun to show. Soccer viewership has shown a consistent increase. For instance, the reach of Barclays Premier League has grown at more than 40% per annum since 2005. The broadcast rights of over 275 international football games, including the 2010 FIFA World Cup, will ensure that Indian soccer enthusiasts continue to get world-class soccer action on their TV screens.The FIFA franchise has always been sought after by broadcasters, but one has never witnessed such a premium for the sport in the Indian Sub-Continent in the past. The FIFA World Cup 2006, for instance, fetched a measly $9 million while the World Cup in 2002 went for just $3 million.The sudden rise in bids is attributed to the fact that soccer is gaining ground in India. ESPN Star had bagged the exclusive rights to telecast the championship in the Indian Sub-Continent in 2006 while Ten Sports was the official broadcaster in 2002.Meanwhile, the UAE has won the rights to stage the 2009 and 2010 editions of the FIFA Club World Cup, beating Japan, Australia and Portugal.
