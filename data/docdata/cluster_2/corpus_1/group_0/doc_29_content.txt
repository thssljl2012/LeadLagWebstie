 Hull manager Phil Brown claims a deal for Wigan striker Marlon King is 'almost 90% done'.The 28-year-old Jamaica international discussed personal terms with the Barclays Premier League newcomers on Tuesday.Brown told Sky Sports News: 'It is almost 90% done but that last 10% can always be the sticking point.'King only joined Wigan in January but boss Steve Bruce seems prepared to cut his losses on the player after just one goal in 15 appearances following his 4million move from Watford.Brown added: 'I spoke at length with Marlon and his representatives yesterday at the training ground.'We have agreed our end. Where Wigan are concerned, they are happy with the transfer dealings, and we are happy with the contract negotiations with regards to Marlon.'But there are still loose ends to tie up at the Wigan end, so we are just sitting back and waiting for the green light from Wigan.'There is still a medical to go through for a start.'King is likely to cost a club record fee, beating the amount paid for Peter Halmosi earlier this month, which although undisclosed is thought to be around 2million.
