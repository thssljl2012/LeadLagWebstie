 Primebrokers Securities, the stock lending arm of Chimaera Capital, has entered voluntary administration.The move comes after creditors ANZ Bank appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers as receivers and managers to Primebroker Securities on July 4.In April, the bank had originally agreed to provide $55 million in funding to Primebrokers but then called the deal off after conducting due diligence.Primebrokers said it hopes to restructure the business rather than allow it to fall into liquidation, according to a statement from the company. ANZ's total exposure to Primebrokers is said to be $50 million, although the figure is unrelated to the $55 million originally extended by the bank.''The directors believe that adopting this course of action would provide an outcome that will be more advantageous to all stakeholders,'' Primebrokers said in a release.ANZ's entanglement in Primebroker's demise comes after margin loans brought about the collapse of Opes Prime Stockbrokers. The collapse pitted ANZ Bank against the broker's 1200 clients in a battle over who retained the legal right to the shares that were loaned.Sources close to Primebrokers suggested the broker may seek legal action against ANZ Bank.ANZ Bank was seeking to change its creditor position from ''unsecured'' to ''secured'' in a move that would allow ANZ to step to the front of the line when assets were returned to creditors.ANZ Bank was not available for comment.Primebrokers assets include investment company Luminus Systems, WA-gas explorer Blue Energy and other debtors.Luminus is closely related to Chimaera Capital, sharing executives Ian Pattison and Sal Catalano. Mr Pattison is the co-founder of Chimaera, while Mr Catalano is CEO and chairman.czappone@fairfax.com.auBusinessDay
