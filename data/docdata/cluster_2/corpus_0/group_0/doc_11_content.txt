Already has a shopping mall reit listed on the SGXThe Singapore Exchange had recently on 25 June 2008 issued an eligibility-to-list to FCL for the listing of its planned commercial REIT. With the acquisition of the Allco REIT units and the manager, FCL will terminate the listing plans and intends to offer the current portfolio of commercial assets as a potential pipeline for the acquired Allco REITF&amp;amp;N plans to inject Alexandra Point, Alexandra Technopark and the office and ancillary retail components of Valley Point, into Allco Reit.-Upon completion of the transaction, Allco REIT will be renamed Frasers Commercial Trust, and it will be the vehicle through which FCL will further its commercial property activitiesThis is when the share price will start climbing up and the yield start going down  - if market conditions permit - once the yield goes down enough, F&amp;amp;N can inject in their properties and call it "yield accretive"take note - 'upon completion', more info below.-We have clear plans to bolster and strengthen the financial position of Allco REIT. FCL, as part of the Fraser &amp;amp; Neave Group, will be able to assist Allco REIT in negotiating the refinancing of its existing loans, which will bring clear benefits to Allco REITs unit holders. said Mr Lim.Under FCLs management, Allco REIT is set to grow by leveraging on a ready pipeline of assets comprising S$700 million worth of commercial assets owned by FCL in Singapore.-Completion of the SPA is conditional upon certain conditions precedent being fulfilled or waived on or prior to 30 September 2008(1) the Monetary Authority of Singapore not raising an objection to FCL acquiring ASL;(2) receipt of Australian Foreign Investment Review Board approval for (or no-objection to) the Acquisition;(3) waiver of certain covenants under Allco REITs financial indebtedness to Commonwealth Bank of Australia;(4) no breach of certain representations, warranties and undertakings given by the Sellers under the SPA; and(5) no occurrence of certain evenCompletion of the Acquisition is currently expected to be on 6 August 2008.-Hmm..so 6 August and 30 september are important dates for people invested in Allco Reit.  Personally, I believe that should the SPA be successfully completed on 30 september, Allco will definately be worth much more then its current $0.765 price.Its unaudited NAV is now $1.44, with a comfortable 'recession safeguard' of 30%, the nav is still at $1.08 or $1.F&amp;amp;N is paying a price of $0.830 per share, still 65 cents more then today's closing price. Those buying in now are betting the deal will be successful. If somehow, the deal is called off, i think allco's share price can go even lower then $0.700..mainly because of their enormous debts, worth half their assets and all due in 2009.-More infoS$2,045.5 million in total assets (probably will be revalued lower)S$916.9 million in borrowings - all due in 2009 (thats almost $1 billion or half its total assets)Portfolio Occupancy is 97.5%, down from 98.8%current forecast dividend yield at $0.765 is 8.36%net property income of S$22.1 millionamount available for distribution of S$11.3 millionif F&amp;amp;N can lower its borrowings/finance expenses, the DPU will be positively affected.Japanese currency income hedged for 5 years at S$1.00 = 72.93Australian currency income hedged for FY2008 at A$1.00 = S$1.1904last point to note.  If the SPA is successful. Then F&amp;amp;N will take over the financing/debt responsibilities ! if that happens, All current investors can take a huge sigh of relief.
