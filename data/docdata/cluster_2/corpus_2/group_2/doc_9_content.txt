Where in the Bible does it say that Jesus was created.  Col 1:15 doesn&amp;#039;t work.  What else do you have?   Sly (Kevin) wrote~ Yes it dose actually I wouldn&amp;#039;t expect someone that has all their hopes and faith wrapped up in the trinitarian dogma to jump a sinking boat just based on one scripture either. But consider all the secular evidence that is out there some of the material was furnished on one of these threads to you personally When you asked me well what supposed things I had read. Hopefully you&amp;#039;ll gather the savvy and courage to examine them at length one day.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~          Firstborn in Greek means preeminent, not the first one born.  This verse is saying that Jesus was preeminent over creation.   Firstborn in Hebrew means both the first one born and can also mean preeminent.   AN Example:  In Genesis 41:51-52 Manassah is the firstborn.  Yet in Jeremiah 31:9, Ephraim is firstborn (preeminent over Manessah).  Manassah was dropped out because of his sins.      Also- Proverbs 8:22 (God produced Jesus as the first of his works)?  Wisdom is speaking in this verse.  Yet Proverbs 1:20, 4:7-8, 8:22, &amp;amp; 9:1 show that wisdom is female.  And Proverbs 8:12 says that Prudence lives with wisdom.  So these verses could NOT be referring to Jesus.       -And- Revelation 3:14 (Jesus is the beginning of God&amp;#039;s creation. He had a beginning)?  The word beginning in this verse is from the Greek word &amp;quot;arche&amp;quot;,  which means first cause.   Some translations render this verse- &amp;quot;JESUS IS: the beginner (Goodspeed),  the moving cause (Barclays),  the prime source (NEB),  the ultimate source (JB) ... OF GOD&amp;#039;S CREATION&amp;quot;.   Since the use of the Greek word arche in Revelation 1:8 and 21:6 does not mean that God the father had a created beginning,  why insist that arche in Revelation 3:14 means that Jesus had a created beginning?          Phil.2:5-8 Who being in the form of (nature) God- (Gal. 4:8: there is only one God by nature)- did not consider it robbery to be equal with God.   But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men (nature)-   In becoming a man something CHANGED since he was not in a servant role to the Father before He became man.  This was a change of position, not a change in nature.  He, as God, could not empty himself of His essential nature, since unchangeableness is part of his nature.  All His attributes are eternal so he could not eliminate any but he could put them aside in using them as He entered time and space to reach mankind.   That is how powerful God is!        Col. 1:16-17 Speaking of the Son;  For BY HIM (Jesus) ALL THINGS WERE CREATED- that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.   The text is revealing that it was in Him that all things were created (Greek- en as the essential instrumental of agency).          In Jn.17:.5 Jesus prays- And now, O Father, glorify thou Me with thine own Self with the glory which I had WITH THEE before the world was-&amp;quot; Here is Jesus asking to be restored to His glory that He always had but was presently hidden under the veil of flesh.        The Father speaking, in Hebrews v.8 - But to the Son He says: Your throne, O God is forever and ever... God, even thy God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. (Heb.1:8)   Here is God the Father saying to the Son He is God and he has a throne which is ETENAL.         In Heb.1:10 The Father speaking of the Son says, You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of your hands... and they shall be changed: but thou art the same.   This is a quote from the Old Testament of Psalm 102:25 and is speaking of God.   The writer attributed the &amp;quot;name&amp;quot; Yahweh to the Son in Heb 1:10, and the Father addresses the Son as eternal and being immutable they will perish, you will remain.         Speaking of Jesus whose goings forth are from old (ancient times) from everlasting (from eternity). (Micah 5:2)     Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. (Hebrews 13:8)    Jesus is not a created being!
