    Buy The Truth - Prov. 23:23:       jacki:    For by him (Jesus)  ALL THINGSwere created:     things in heaven and on earth,   visible and invisible,   whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities;   all things were created by him and for him.    He is before all things,     and in him   all things hold together  .  *snipped for space*      Well, I have to say that is somewhat shorter than you usually post; but, do you think you could just choose one or two verses or points at a time PLEASE. It makes it so much easier for dialog and less confusion, as well as, shorter length. Of course, if you didn&amp;#039;t use such large print and so many spaces in between, it wouldn&amp;#039;t seem quite so long either.    The Bible explains that the word &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; is a relative term. That means &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#039;t always include everything as it is a conditional word.     1 Corinthians 15:27,28 helps us understand the relationship between God and his son, Jesus, when the term &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; is used.    &amp;quot;For he (God) hath put ALL things under his (Jesus&amp;#039;) feet. But when he saith ALL things are put under him, it is manifest that he (God) is excepted, which did put ALL things under him (Jesus). When ALL things shall be subdued unto him (Jesus), then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be ALL in ALL.&amp;quot;    Thus, when Colossians 1:16, which you quoted above, speaks of the &amp;quot;all things&amp;quot; that were created: things in heaven and on earth, we know that these &amp;quot;all things&amp;quot; did not include God himself. We also know that the &amp;quot;all things&amp;quot; did not include Jesus himself, since the scriptures tell us that God created Jesus. Colossians 1:15; Revelation 3:14 That is why Jesus is called God&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;only begotten son,&amp;quot; because Jesus is the only creature that God created directly by himself without his dear son&amp;#039;s help.     Ephesians 3:9,10,14 explains how this occurred, &amp;quot; . . .God, who created all things by Jesus Christ . . . according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord. For this cause I bow my knees unto THE FATHER of our Lord Jesus Christ.&amp;quot;               &amp;quot;since the scriptures tell us that God created Jesus&amp;quot;          I disagree. Colossians 1:16-17 tells us that   ALL THINGS   were created byJesus- not some things. Things in HEAVEN and on earth-  If Jesus was a created being, according to this scripture, he would have had to create HIMSELF.  We are also told that HE, Jesus-hold all things together.  Genesis 1:1 tells us that GOD created the heavens and the earth.               Proverbs     8:22 SAYS THAT    God produced Jesus as the first of his works-       What does that mean?      Wisdom is speaking in this verse.  Yet Proverbs   1:20  , 4:7-8,   8:22  , &amp;amp; 9:1 show that wisdom is female. And Proverbs   8:12   says that Prudence lives with wisdom.   So these verses could not be referring to Jesus.              Colossians     1:15 says that    Jesus was born, he had a beginning. Yet God always was and always will be.       What does this mean?        Firstborn in Greek means preeminent,  not the first one born.   This verse is saying that Jesus was  preeminent over creation .  Firstborn in Hebrew means both the first one born and can also mean preeminent.  An Example:  In Genesis 41:51-52 Manassah is the firstborn.  Yet in Jeremiah 31:9, Ephraim is firstborn (preeminent over Manessah).                Revelation     3:14 says that     Jesus is the beginning of God&amp;#039;s creation. He had a beginning.      What does this mean?       The word beginning in this verse is from the Greek word   arche  , which means  &amp;quot;first cause&amp;quot;.   Some translations render this verse &amp;quot;JESUS IS: the beginner (Goodspeed),  the moving cause (Barclays),  the prime source (  NEB  ),  the ultimate source (JB) OF GOD&amp;#039;S CREATION&amp;quot;.   Since the use of the Greek word arche in  Revelation 1:8 and 21:6 does not mean that God the father had a created beginning-  why insist that arche in Revelation 3:14 means that Jesus had a created beginning?
