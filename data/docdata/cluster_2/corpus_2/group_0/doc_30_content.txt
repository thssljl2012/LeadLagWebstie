                           It&amp;#039;s a fair Kop - Liverpool land 19million Keane and then say                         sorry to Spurs                            &amp;amp;nbsp;                                                       &amp;amp;nbsp;                                                         Liverpool apologised to Tottenham on Monday night and                         made a charitable donation to their Barclays Premier League rivals                         as Robbie Keane&amp;#039;s 19million move to Anfield reached a bizarre                         conclusion.                            In return, Spurs dropped an official complaint accusing                         Liverpool of tapping up Keane before the Republic of Ireland                         striker demanded a move                           He added: &amp;#039;In light of that acknowledgement they have apologised                         and agreed to make a donation to our club&amp;#039;s main charity, the                         Tottenham Hotspur Foundation. Tottenham has therefore agreed not to                         pursue its official complaint to the Premier League.&amp;#039;                           Keane has signed a four-year deal worth 80,000-a-week with the                         club he supported as a boy and could make his debut in Wednesday                         night&amp;#039;s friendly against Villarreal after flying to Spain with the                         rest of Benitez&amp;#039;s squad on Tuesday.                           On Monday night, Keane attempted to defuse the row by thanking                         the Tottenham board, players and fans for his six years at White                         Hart Lane.                           He said: &amp;#039;I would specifically like to thank Daniel Levy for                         understanding that, as a fan, joining Liverpool is a lifelong dream                         of mine and one I couldn&amp;#039;t let pass me by. I hope one day the Spurs                         fans, who have been brilliant to me, can understand this, too.&amp;#039;                           In partnering the Irishman with Fernando Torres, Benitez has                         sent out a clear message that he finally intends to launch a                         serious assault on the League title - last won under Kenny Dalglish                         back in 1990 - having been criticised for placing too much emphasis                         on the Champions League.                           The Spaniard must now find a way of financing an 18m bid for                         Aston Villa midfielder Gareth Barry and could even listen to offers                         for Dirk Kuyt.                           Tottenham fans face more disappointment, with Dimitar Berbatov&amp;#039;s                         transfer to Manchester United nearing completion. He cut a moody                         figure on the Spurs bench on Monday night, not getting changed                         despite being named as a substitute in the friendly against                         Norwich.                           However, David Bentley&amp;#039;s 17m move from Blackburn to Spurs will                         go through this week and coach Juande Ramos can now use the Keane                         cash to pursue Russian targets Andrei Arshavin and Roman                         Pavlyuchenko, plus Sevilla&amp;#039;s Diego Capel.                           &amp;amp;nbsp;
