In return, Spurs dropped an official complaint accusing Liverpool of tapping up Keane before the Republic of Ireland striker demanded a move      However, Liverpool&amp;#039;s unprecedented gesture did little to appease furious Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, who claimed his club had been forced into accepting a deal that could eventually rise to 20.3m.       &amp;#039;I don&amp;#039;t regard it as a transfer deal,&amp;#039; said Levy. &amp;#039;That&amp;#039;s something which happens between clubs when they both agree to trade. This is very much an enforced sale.      &amp;#039;I was incredibly disappointed when I first heard not only that Liverpool had been working behind the scenes to bring Robbie to Anfield, but that Robbie himself wanted to go and he submitted a transfer request to this effect.&amp;#039;       Levy revealed that Liverpool had said sorry for the &amp;#039;inappropriate&amp;#039; way its official website reported comments by Rafael Benitez confirming his interest in Keane.       He added: &amp;#039;In light of that acknowledgement they have apologised and agreed to make a donation to our club&amp;#039;s main charity, the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation. Tottenham has therefore agreed not to pursue its official complaint to the Premier League.&amp;#039;       Keane has signed a four-year deal worth 80,000-a-week with the club he supported as a boy and could make his debut in Wednesday night&amp;#039;s friendly against Villarreal after flying to Spain with the rest of Benitez&amp;#039;s squad on Tuesday.       On Monday night, Keane attempted to defuse the row by thanking the Tottenham board, players and fans for his six years at White Hart Lane.       He said: &amp;#039;I would specifically like to thank Daniel Levy for understanding that, as a fan, joining Liverpool is a lifelong dream of mine and one I couldn&amp;#039;t let pass me by. I hope one day the Spurs fans, who have been brilliant to me, can understand this, too.&amp;#039;       In partnering the Irishman with Fernando Torres, Benitez has sent out a clear message that he finally intends to launch a serious assault on the League title - last won under Kenny Dalglish back in 1990 - having been criticised for placing too much emphasis on the Champions League.       The Spaniard must now find a way of financing an 18m bid for Aston Villa midfielder Gareth Barry and could even listen to offers for Dirk Kuyt.        Tottenham fans face more disappointment, with Dimitar Berbatov&amp;#039;s transfer to Manchester United nearing completion. He cut a moody figure on the Spurs bench on Monday night, not getting changed despite being named as a substitute in the friendly against Norwich.        ***      Maybe Levy wants an apology from United too to complete Berbatov signing?                      I highly doubt he&amp;#039;s gonna get an apology from Fergie.   Unless of course it&amp;#039;s followed by a post-signing rant about what a bunch of twats the Spurs board are.
