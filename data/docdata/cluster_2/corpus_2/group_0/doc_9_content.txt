    Buy The Truth - Prov. 23:23:       KEVIN SZABO:   There is no trinity, as God the Father, is GOD Almighty; and, Jesus is His son. Quite simple really.      ok then who is he if not God. an angel? a demon? he is not the one who hold all thing together? he is not the one who created all things and that without him was nothing created that was created?    Well, if you will please look up Job 1:6 and 38:7, you will find that angels are called &amp;quot;sons of God.&amp;quot; They are also called &amp;quot;morning stars.&amp;quot; Jesus is described by both of those phrases. Please see Revelation 22:16.  Jesus is God&amp;#039;s firstborn of all creatures. Colossians 1:15 That means that Jesus is the first creature that God Almighty created before He used his dear and only begotten son, Jesus, to create all other things, as Ephesians 3:9,14 explains.      Disagree.       For by him (JESUS)  all things were created  : (Not &amp;quot;some things&amp;quot;, not &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; things)     things in heaven and on earth,   (Angels are in heaven)     visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities;  all things were created by him    and for him.   (An angel or created being would not create ALL THINGS for himself.         He is before all things  , (Before all things- Jesus cannot be created)  and in him all things   hold together  .       Col 1:16-17                    In Colossians 1:15 ,Firstborn in Greek means preeminent, not the first one born.  This verse is saying that Jesus was preeminent over creation.  Firstborn in Hebrew means both the first one born and can also mean preeminent.  An Example: In Genesis 41:51-52 Manassah is the firstborn.  Yet in Jeremiah 31:9, Ephraim is firstborn (preeminent over Manessah).        In Revelation 3:14,  The word beginning in this verse is from the Greek word &amp;quot;arche&amp;quot;, which means first cause.  Some translations render this verse &amp;quot;JESUS IS: the beginner (Goodspeed),  the moving cause (Barclays),  the prime source (  NEB  ),  the ultimate source (JB) OF GOD&amp;#039;S CREATION&amp;quot;.   Since the use of the Greek word arche in Revelation 1:8 and 21:6 does not mean that God the father had a created beginning- why insist that arche in Revelation 3:14 means that Jesus had a created beginning?           In Proverbs 8:22 , Wisdom is speaking in this verse.  Yet Proverbs   1:20  , 4:7-8,   8:22  , &amp;amp; 9:1 show that wisdom is female.  And Proverbs   8:12  says that Prudence lives with wisdom.  So these verses could not be referring to Jesus.
