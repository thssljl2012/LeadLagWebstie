HONOLULU --With an eye on the immediate aftermath of the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, thousands of World War II veterans and other observers are expected on Sunday to commemorate the 67th anniversary of the devastating Japanese military raid.The theme of the event  "Pacific War Memories: The Heroic Response to Pearl Harbor"  is something of a departure from the past.Usually, the commemoration focuses on the attack on the USS Arizona, Pearl Harbor and several other installations on Oahu. But this year's remembrance ceremony will center more on the months following the raid, said Eileen Martinez, chief of interpretation for the National Park Service."We're moving into the Pacific War, the first strike back," she said.To that end, one of two keynote speakers will be Thomas Griffin, a surviving member of the pilots and crew who answered the Pearl Harbor attack four months later with an aircraft carrier-launched bomber raid on Tokyo.The B-25 mission, led by Lt. Col. James H. Doolittle, inflicted little damage on Japan but boosted morale in America and led the embarrassed Japanese government to launch an ill-fated attack on Midway IslandAt the same time back on December 7, 1941 in Ottawa we lived at 193 Florence Avenue. My Mom and Dad were taking me for lunch somewhere on Bank Street. As we left the house (which was one of a row of houses, much like today's townhouses) we looked up and saw smoke billowing from the rooftops.Thankfully nobody was killed or seriously injured, but the entire row of houses was destroyed that afternoon and our lives were forever changed.Something we have in common with Pearl Harbor.. our fire and the start of the war with Japan.
