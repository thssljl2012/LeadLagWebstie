UPDATE: A snippet of Blago&amp;#8217;s phone call in which he refers to his friend the President-elect as a motherfucker: &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve got this thing and it&amp;#8217;s f***ing golden, and, uh, uh, I&amp;#8217;m just not giving it up for f***in&amp;#8217; nothing. I&amp;#8217;m not gonna do it. And I can always use it. I can parachute me there,&amp;#8221; Blagojevich said in a phone call secretly recorded by the FBI on November 5, the day after the election, according to the affidavit. The FBI affidavit said Blagojevich had been told by an adviser &amp;#8220;the President-elect can get ROD BLAGOJEVICH&amp;#8217;s wife on paid corporate boards in exchange for naming the President-elect&amp;#8217;s pick to the Senate.&amp;#8221; Told by two other advisers he has to &amp;#8220;suck it up&amp;#8221; for two years, the FBI says it heard Blagojevich complain he has to give this &amp;#8220;motherf***er [the President-elect] his Senator. F*** him. For nothing? F*** him.&amp;#8221; Class act. The same Governor Blagojevich who ordered all state agencies to stop doing business with Bank of America to pressure the bank into helping workers at Republic was just arrested by the F.B.I. on federal corruption charges. Blagojevich and Harris were accused of a wide-ranging criminal conspiracy that included Blagojevich conspiring to sell or trade the Senate seat left vacant by President-elect Barack Obama in exchange for financial benefits for the governor and his wife. The governor was also accused of obtaining campaign contributions in exchange for other official actions. Blagojevich also was alleged to be using a favors list, made up largely of individuals and firms that have state contracts or received taxpayer benefits, from which to conduct a $2.5 million fundraising drive before year&amp;#8217;s end. Even Blagojevich&amp;#8217;s recently announced $1.8 billion plan for new interchanges and &amp;#8220;green lanes&amp;#8221; on the Illinois Tollway was subject to corruption, prosecutors alleged. His strong arm blackout of BofA was business as usual for the Governor, eh?
