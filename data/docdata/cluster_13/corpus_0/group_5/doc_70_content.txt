Under the guidance of chief executive David Jones, Euro RSCG has been kicking ass and taking names.     According to The Wall Street Journal:  Mr. Jones, who built up Euro RSCG in part by recruiting senior executives from rivals JWT, TBWA Worldwide and BBDO Worldwide, says he plans to continue hiring during the downturn. "We are going to steal some of the best people out there," he says.  Damn, that's a bold declaration, especially when talking to a reporter. Of course, it's also reality in this business.  Jones says his New York and Chicago offices will increase revenue by more than 20% this year. That's good news for Friend of AdPulp (FoA), Steffan Postaer.   Asked to comment, Postaer says, "We are really blessed here in Chicago. If you recall, four years ago, when I came on board, Euro Tathum Partners (as it was called) was a battered shell of its former self. The previous regime was in disarray and the ad practice was down to one client, Summer's Eve. The local press (Lewis Lazare) called it a "corpse" and me an arrogant fool for taking the job. Now we are among the very few agencies in Chicago (North America?) actually having a good year--maybe even a great year. Double digit growth. We are making good advertising and marketing communications. Valspar, Cabot, Powershares, Michelob, Effen Vodka, Sprint, Citibank, Barilla, Kraft are all part of our client roster now. Valspar was named the best integrated campaign in Chicago at our local awards show in September. But the best thing is I work for a company where everyone is happy and excited to be here. Our politics are minimal. Folks wear the company tee-shirt with pride. Like I said, a blessing."
