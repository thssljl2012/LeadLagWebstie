I came across a post about the Mossad, here on WordPress. The writer seems to be glorifying this group of mercenaries and state-sponsored terrorists. Mossad, for those who don&amp;#8217;t know, is Israel&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;CIA&amp;#8221; but twice as immoral, deadly and violent. I&amp;#8217;m sure many readers have heard or come across stories about what the Mossad did to its own citizens and/or Jews, in order to force all Jews in the Middle East to move to Israel. This was not done out of concern for the Jews who lived in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria or elsewhere: this was their way of creating fear and spreading rumors that it was the &amp;#8220;Arabs&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Muslims&amp;#8221; who were attacking the Jewish communities or synagogues and force them to populate Israel in order to create a &amp;#8220;Jewish&amp;#8221; majority in Palestine. The Mossad&amp;#8217;s deception and some of the stories can be found in this story: (Source) In February of 2000, Indian intelligence officials detained 11 members of what they thought was an Al Qaeda hijacking conspiracy. It was then discovered that these 11 &amp;#8220;Muslim preachers&amp;#8221; were all Israeli nationals! India&amp;#8217;s leading weekly magazine, The Week, reported: On January 12 Indian intelligence officials in Calcutta detained 11 foreign nationals for interrogation before they were to board a Dhaka-bound Bangladesh Biman flight. They were detained on the suspicion of being hijackers. &amp;#8220;But we realized that they were tabliqis (Islamic preachers), so we let them go&amp;#8221;, said an Intelligence official. The eleven had Israeli passports but were believed to be Afghan nationals who had spent a while in Iran. Indian intelligence officials, too, were surprised by the nationality profile of the eleven. &amp;#8220;They say that they have been on tabligh (preaching Islam) in India for two months. But they are Israeli nationals from the West Bank,&amp;#8221; said a Central Intelligence official. He claimed that Tel Aviv &amp;#8220;exerted considerable pressure&amp;#8221; on Delhi to secure their release. &amp;#8220;It appeared that they could be working for a sensitive organization in Israel and were on a mission to Bangladesh,&amp;#8221; the official said. (emphasis added) What were these 11 Israelis doing trying to impersonate Al Qaeda men? Infiltrating?&amp;#8230;perhaps. Framing?&amp;#8230;more likely. But the important precedent to understand is this: Israeli agents were once caught red handed impersonating Muslim hijackers! This event becomes even more mind boggling when we learn that it was Indian Intelligence that helped the US to so quickly identify the &amp;#8220;19 hijackers&amp;#8221;! On April 3, 2002, Express India, quoting the Press Trust of India, revealed: Washington, April 3: Indian intelligence agencies helped the US to identify the hijackers who carried out the deadly September 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, a media report said here on Wednesday. Now FF&amp;gt;&amp;gt; to the events and massacre in Mumbai, India. On Tuesday, December 2, 2008, the BBC reported the following, about the only &amp;#8220;surviving&amp;#8221; terrorist: [They] also said that Qasab is a 21-year-old and a fluent English speaker.  That description seems to be at odds with the general population in the village he is said to hail from.  Confusingly, there are three villages by the name of Faridkot in this part of southern Punjab. A BBC Urdu service colleague visited two of them and found no one who knew of the man currently in Indian detention.  Suspect named as Azam Amir Qasab 21 years old, fluent English speaker.  Told police he is from Faridkot village, in Pakistan's Punjab province.  Said the attackers took orders from handlers in Pakistan.  The story further unfolds in this report: Pappu Mishra was tending to his customers at his glass-walled cafe at the gothic Victorian Chattrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station in Mumbai when he spotted two sprightly young men dressed in black.           He remembers the two sauntering into the waiting hall, plonking their handbags on the floor, taking out a gun &amp;#8220;which looked like an AK-47&amp;#8243;, and walking toward the platforms where they gunned down late-evening commuters on the city&amp;#8217;s busy suburban train network. &amp;#8220;Their audaciousness was breath-taking,&amp;#8221; he says.  &amp;#8220;One man loaded the magazine into the gun, the other kept shooting. They appeared calm and composed. They were not in the slightest hurry. They didn&amp;#8217;t seem to be afraid at all.&amp;#8221;  The men entered a platform and shot a man near an automated teller machine.     Bodies with gaping bullet wounds lay all over, and the waiting hall became a sea of blood Pappu Mishra   &amp;#8220;It was the longest 10-15 minutes of my life,&amp;#8221; Mr Mishra said. &amp;#8220;They fired at least three rounds without any resistance. I had no clue why they were doing this.&amp;#8221; Then, the &amp;#8220;foreign looking, fair skinned&amp;#8221; men, as Mr Mishra remembers them, simply carried on killing. Locals say the orgy of killings in Mumbai began here. Three men walked into the cafe, drank beer, settled their bills and walked out. Then they fished out guns from their bags and began firing.  Gaffar Abdul Amir, an Iraqi tourist from Baghdad, says he saw at least two men who started the firing outside the Leopold Cafe.  He was returning to his hotel from the seaside with a friend when he saw two men carrying bags and brandishing AK-47s walking in front of them, shooting.  &amp;#8220;They did not look Indian, they looked foreign. One of them, I thought, had blonde hair. The other had a punkish hairstyle. They were neatly dressed,&amp;#8221; says Mr Amir.    The whole affair smells like a false flag event designed to bring India into a more active role in the War on Terror, and rein in control of the Indian/Afghani/Pakistani region with NATO/US forces. With much of the world now demanding Pakistan agree to inspections and an investigation, they seem to be winning the minds of those who don&amp;#8217;t bother to question what they are spoon fed on the television.    The more I researched, the more interesting information becomes available. Although I am convinced that the Mossad is involved - if not fully directed this massacre - the Indian Sikh, the archenemy of Muslims in the region, stand to benefit tremendously by brewing such turmoil. This will force the Indian government to retaliate and a war between India and Pakistan becomes eminent.     Evidence being deliberately ignored?   Strange that none of the media (TV or Print) have picked this up at all. Or have they been deliberately ignoring it? Have a look at the attached pictures of one of the terrorists. Notice the orange thread / band on his right hand. Tying a red thread or cord around the wrist is a Hindu practice and it is unlikely a Muslim, especially one politicized enough to carry out an attack such as this, would observe it. I think this provides more evidence that this was a false flag operation or at least an attack by a non-Muslim group.   For more information about the significance of the red thread click here. Additionally, the terrorists inside the Nariman House Building were reported to have stocked up on supplies on Wednesday evening, buying not just food items but liquor, among other things, from a local store. Again, it is highly unlikely that a Muslim, let alone a &amp;#8216;Mujahid&amp;#8217;, and especially one politicized enough to carry out such an attack, would consume liquor in normal life, let alone hours before his inevitable &amp;#8216;martyrdom&amp;#8217;. Don&amp;#8217;t let the media ignore such facts! Circulate this to as many people as you can as we strongly believe it wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been ignored if the terrorists were carrying a copy of the Qur&amp;#8217;an, or a taveez.     The Head Of Mumbai Police assassinated - Source    The Mumbai ATS chief Hemant Karkare and other officers of the ATS have been killed. These were the same people who were investigating the Malegaon Blastsin which Praggya Singh, an army officer and several other noted personalities of the BJP-RSS-Bajrang Dal-VHP were arrested. Karkare was the man to arrest them. Karkare was receiving threats from several quarters. LK Advani, the BJP chief and several other prominent leaders of the so-called Hindu terrorism squad were gunning for his head. And the first casualty in the terrorist attack was Karkare!  The Gunfire Started At A Israeli House  He is deadgonethe firing by terrorists began from Nariman Housewhich is the only building in Mumbai inhabited by Jews. Some Hindu Gujaratis of the Nariman area spoke live on several TV channelsthey openly said that the firing by terrorists began from Nariman house (links to &amp;#8220;Real Jew News!&amp;#8221;). And that for two years suspicious activities were going on in this house. But no one took notice. Our worst fears have come true. It is clear that Mossad is involved in the whole affair. An entire city has been attacked by Mossad and probably units of mercenaries. It is not possible for one single organization to plan and execute such a sophisticated operation. It is clear that this operation was backed by communal forces from within the Indian State. Israelis Have been Entering India   A photograph published in Urdu Times, Mumbai, clearly shows that Mossad and ex-Mossad men came to India and met Sadhus and other pro-Hindutva elements recently. A conspiracy was clearly hatched. This is a moment of reckoning especially for Hindus of India. The killers of Gandhi have struck again. If we are true Sanatanis and true Hindus and true nationalists and true patriots we have to see this act as a clear attack by anti-national deshdrohi forces. Praggya Singh, Advani and the entire brand is anti-national. They ought to be shot. Any Hindu siding with them is hereafter warned of serious consequences.    Israeli counter-terrorism experts are now touring Jammu and Kashmir and several other states in India at the invitation of Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani to make an assessment of...
