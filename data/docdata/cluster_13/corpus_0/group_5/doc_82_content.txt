     The Westpac CEE team (Customer Experience Evaluation) from Westpac Phone Assist have great news about what can be achieved with persistence when we work together through Finsec. This team had missed out on the Westpac 5% pay increase and was told by the bank that they were not covered by the collective agreement. However, Finsec delegate Suzanne Hamilton asked the bank to please explain and Finsec came to the conclusion that the wording of the collective did not exclude her and her colleagues. Westpac has come back to say that members in this team will be given the option to join the collective and the pay rise backdated to 1 August. Suzanne said that the achievement was a team effort, including local Finsec Union Councillor Kathryn McIlwraith and local organiser Diane Riley as well as Finsec members in the CEE team. Suzanne says that while they were grateful for Westpac that this wouldnt have happened without the union. This is a great result for us and we now have the choice to join the collective for the first time. We can now receive the same pay rise as others in the call centre  and we think of this as fairness in our workplace.
