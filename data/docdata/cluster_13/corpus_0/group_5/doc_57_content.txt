            When I quit my day job and no longer have to get to the Central West End just east of the Delmar Loop area every day, it'd be nice not to have to have a car and therefore to get auto insurance quotes. Yet it doesn't look like I can do that, even if I give up my night job of delivering pizzas for Dominos which obviously requires me to have a car. I live in an apartment right on Manchester in Ballwin and everything I need is close by -- several branches of Bank of America, several Post Offices, 3 supermarkets, several Chinese carryouts, a McDonald's, Taco Bell, Subway, several Quiznos, the library, several office supply stores, a health food store, and Wal-Mart not much farther away. If I need a car temporarily, there're many rental car offices close to me - Avis, Enterprise and more. What else do I need, right?
