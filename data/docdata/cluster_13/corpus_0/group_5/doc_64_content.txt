An MSN Money writer informs us that without the bailout, citibank "would have reneged on a $400 million, 20-year deal to name the new Mets stadium "Citi Field." Now, one New York pol quipped, "Citi-Taxpayer Field" might be a better name.""Why a quip?  I'd like to start or help out with a campaign to actually name the new Mets stadium "Taxpayer Field."
