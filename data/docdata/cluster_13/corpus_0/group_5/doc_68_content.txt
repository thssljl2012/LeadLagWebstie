Secretary of State James Madison was President Thomas Jefferson&amp;#8217;s chief advisor and stategist; his biggest effort as secretary was, of course, overseeing the negotiations and ratification of the Lousiana Purchase from Emperor Napoleon&amp;#8217;s France in 1803.  The man&amp;#8217;s memory will have nothing on Hillary. According to the partisan New York Times, Hillary is already setting herself up to be the most powerful State secretary in the history of our Republic. As Mrs. Clinton puts together her senior team, [anonymous] officials said, she is also trying to carve out a bigger role for the State Department in economic affairs, where the Treasury has dominated during the Bush years. The paper reports that she will be &amp;#8220;farming out&amp;#8221; her increased power to &amp;#8220;special envoys&amp;#8221; to troubled areas: Afghanistan, India, Iraq, Pakistan, etc.  (She ought to send someone to Chicago.)  As evidence that Hillary wants more and more money for her new fiefdom, the paper instructs, Hillary has recruited Jacob Lew to be one of her deputy secretaries.  Mr. Lew currently runs hedge funds for Citibank.  I don&amp;#8217;t suppose they&amp;#8217;ll cut Hillary&amp;#8217;s rating, though. Hillary&amp;#8217;s rationale for the power and money grab, according to an anonymous advisor through the friendly NYT: Mrs. Clintons push for a more vigorous economic team, one of her advisers said, stems from her conviction that the State Department needs to play a part in the recovery from the global financial crisis. Economic issues also underpin some of the most important diplomatic relationships, notably with China. Will the United States, through its Department of State, be exporting Obama&amp;#8217;s ideology?  I suspect, then, that she&amp;#8217;s studied the Domino Theory.  The paper describes Hillary&amp;#8217;s power grab as a reaction to President Bush&amp;#8217;s emasculation of the State Department under Colin Powell; after all, they stipulate, the traditional powers of the State Department were given to Cheney, Rumsfeld, the Pentagon, and the neocons.  They ignore that General Powell has not held the office since the end of President Bush&amp;#8217;s first term.  Their only mention of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is when the mention they she did not utilize special envoys. Also, the paper stresses that Hillary&amp;#8217;s power grab is a victory for diplomacy.  They ignore their own praise of Hillary for demanding more money for her department, which means that this is a victory for a sort of Dollar Diplomacy.  And the fact, which the paper itself argued in 1997, that Hillary&amp;#8217;s husband attempted his Dollar Diplomacy through the Commerce Department. I hope the Senators on the Foreign Relations Committee Hillary, at her confirmation hearings, about her &amp;#8220;vision/s.&amp;#8221;  Chairman John Kerry is, after all, known as a never mind.
