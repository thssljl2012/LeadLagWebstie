Very briefly this morning, another article on the scam affecting American attorneys, originating in "East Asia."  "I've had clients from Taiwan and Hong Kong who I've never laid eyes on, and collected unclaimed property for them without any trouble," Sack said. But when a call to Citibank proved this check was invalid, Sack called Eagle Power Equipment. He said he got a laugh from that company's controller, who said he was not only not paying any debts to Tomen, but that he'd been getting calls from small firm lawyers across the country.  Not sure I understand the first sentence.  Think I get the middle part.  Amazed to read the final sentence.  How many "small firm lawyers across the country?"
