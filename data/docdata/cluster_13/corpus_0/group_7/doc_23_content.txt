Posing as Ethiopian bank officials, a Nigerian and his accomplices stole $27 million from Citibank. Paul Gabriel Amos, 37, a Nigerian citizen who lived in Singapore was arrested when he tried to enter the US last month. Prosecutors said the scheme began in September, when Citibank received a package with documents purportedly signed by officials of the Ethiopian bank instructing Citibank to accept instructions by fax. There was also a list of officials who could be called to confirm such requests. The signatures of the officials appeared to match those in Citibanks records and were accepted by Citibank, the complaint says. In October, Citibank received two dozen faxed requests for money to be wired, and it transferred $27 million to accounts controlled by the conspirators in Japan, South Korea, Australia, China, Cyprus and the United States, the complaint says.
