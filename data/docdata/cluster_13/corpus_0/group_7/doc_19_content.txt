     I'm told that the pro-unionizing group won the vote in Madison last night. Good call, everyone. The next step (the first contract) might actually be easier than in most newly-unionized workplaces, as I'm told that both musicians and management have had a long history of behaving as if there kinda was a CBA in place. Let's hope that the inevitable hard feelings amongst management and those musicians on the losing side (and any triumphalism amongst those who voted for unionization) will fade and productive business can be done.When they do get down to negotiations, they might want to spend some time on the temperature clause.
