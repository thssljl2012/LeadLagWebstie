 Even in a down economy, a study shows that perceived value and loyalty prevail over price. In fact, consumer expectations regarding brand value went up 20% this year. A total of 441 brands in 62 categories were included and measured by loyalty only, not awareness or satisfaction.Sixty-nine (69) brands won highest levels of loyalty.  The biggest winners were Avis, JetBlue, Bank of America, Zyrtec, Sam Adams, Cheerios, Allstate, Dunkin' Donuts, Mary Kay, Kodak, W Hotels, Scottrade, Iams, McDonald's, Grey Goose, ABC TV, Nike, Apple, Wal-Mart, the NFL and Tom's of Maine.In the age of social media hype, it emphasizes the need for positive brand discussion and satisfaction among chatter as well as product elements that people perceive as the best value for the money in a competitive landscape.  In other words, this is more relevant that ever.Source: My good buddy Karl Greenberg @ MediapostFollow Me!:
