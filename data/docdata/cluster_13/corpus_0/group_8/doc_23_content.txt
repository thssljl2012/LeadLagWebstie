UK intelligence sources say that Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, ordered the execution of the British soldiers killed in Northern Ireland on the evening of Saturday 7th March 2009. The murders took place at the Massereene barracks, County Antrim, Northern Ireland (UK). It was the first fatal attack on British troops in the province for more than 12 years. The Real IRA said it had killed the soldiers. This was a calculated revenge attack ordered by Angela Merkel in response to British-orchestrated events which had taken place on 10th-12th September 2008. At that time a sum of $14.0 trillion of sovereign and Queen Elizabeth's loan funds had been removed from US/German manipulation. Accounts at Citibank and Deutsche Bank were involved in interrelated scams.
