[quote Trotsky][quote Swampy]Cornell tends to recruit more from Canada than some of these other schools. [s]And everyone in Canada knows Cornell gives athletic scholarships, eh.[/s] International exchange rates can shift a Canadian family's income. For example, today a family making CN$100K is making only US$77,229.[/quote]  I'm missing something.  I would think the dollar being in the toilet would be good for recruiting from Canada.  Since Cornell tuition is paid in $US, and Canadians can get more $US at the exchange now than they used to, Cornell tuition has actually [i]dropped[/i] for Canadians because of the weakening dollar.  Right?[/quote] No, the Canadian dollar is worth less than 78 cents on the American dollar (down from 90 cents in August 2008).  The American dollar has weakened, yes, but the Canadian has gone even worse.  I make out nice because I pay my Canadian rent and tuition from money stored in a US bank.  Those going the other way, not so much.  The only advantage to a weakening Canadian dollar is that they might qualify for more aid.
