The criminal offense, under common law and according to the statutes of many jurisdictions, of obstructing the administration and due process of law.&#8221; &#8220;This entry contains information applicable to United States law only.&#8221; &#8220;A criminal offense that involves interference, through words or actions, with the proper operations of a court or officers of the court.&#8221; &#8220;Obstruction of justice in the federal courts is governed by a series of criminal statutes (18 U.S.C.A.  1501-1517), which aim to protect the integrity of federal judicial proceedings as well as agency and congressional proceedings. Section 1503 is the primary vehicle for punishing those who obstruct or who endeavor to obstruct federal judicial proceedings.&#8221; &#8220;To obtain a conviction under section 1503, the government must prove that there was a pending federal judicial proceeding, the defendant knew of the proceeding, and the defendant had corrupt intent to interfere with or attempted to interfere with the proceeding.&#8221; http://www.answers.com/topic/obstruction-of-justice The Charge of Treason: Law Encyclopedia: Treason &#8220;This entry contains information applicable to United States law only.&#8221; &#8220;The betrayal of one&#8217;s own country by waging war against it or by consciously or purposely acting to aid its enemies.&#8221; http://www.answers.com/treason The proof of Obstruction of Justice: &#8220;A former landlord of two of the September 11 hijackers was an FBI informant at the time, knowledgeable sources confirm to CNN.&#8221; http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/09/11/ar911.hijackers.landlord/ These hijackers are the same two people the CIA admits they knew were terrorists and were monitoring more than a year before 9/11. We are supposed to believe it&#8217;s a coincidence that the same two were &#8220;accidentally&#8221; let into the country and were coincidentally living with another U.S. Intelligence agent, an FBI informant. That&#8217;s an amazing coincidence. Could an FBI informant also be a CIA informant? This proves it is possible&#8230;.a sentence from the Senate and Congress joint Inquiry into the 9/11 attacks&#8230;. &#8220;In January 2001, CIA concluded, based on statements by a joint CIA/FBI human source, that Khallad appeared in one of the surveillance photos taken during the Malaysia meeting.&#8221; http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/pdf/fullreport_errata.pdf And how did the hijackers end up with this U.S. Intelligence asset that Bush is protecting? They were brought there by Omar al-Bayoumi. What does the Senate and Congress Joint Inquiry have to say about Al-Bayoumi? &#8220;One of the FBIs best sources in San Diego informed the FBI that he thought that al-Bayoumi must be an intelligence officer for Saudi Arabia or another foreign power.&#8221; page 226/858 http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/pdf/fullreport_errata.pdf &#8220;Since September 11, the FBI has learned that al-Bayoumi has connections to terrorist elements. He has been tied to an imam abroad who has connections to al-Qaida. Further, the FBIs Executive Assistant Director for Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence described in testimony before the Joint Inquiry FBI contacts with the [ redacted] government about collection on a person named [redacted ], who has ties to al-Qaida, who has ties to al-Bayoumi. http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/pdf/fullreport_errata.pdf Bayoumi&#8217;s replacement when he departed the U.S. in July 2001 was Osama Bassnan. What did the Senate and Congressional Inquiry think of Bassnan? &#8220;Bassnan was a close associate of al-Bayoumi, &lt;&gt;Bassnan also had close ties to a number of other persons connected to the hijackers, including &lt;&gt;&#8221; page 228/858 http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/pdf/fullreport_errata.pdf &#8220;After September 11, the FBI developed information clearly indicating that Bassnan is an extremist and a Bin Ladin supporter. &lt;&gt;&#8221; page 229/858 http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/pdf/fullreport_errata.pdf And who was paying Al-Bayoumi and Bassnan? &#8220;Sources close to the case told TIME that beginning in January 1999 monthly payments of $2,000 were made from Princess Haifa&#8217;s checking account to Majida Dwaikat, wife of Osama Bassnan. A Saudi national, Bassnan was living in San Diego last year and has been linked to Omar al Bayoumi, a Saudi student who befriended two men who wound up helping crash Flight 77 into the Pentagon. The sources also say that the ambassador, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, gave $15,000 to Bassnan.&#8221; http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1003790,00.html That&#8217;s from Time Magazine because President Bush made it illegal to say it in the Senate and Congressional Report, because he classified that section of it&#8230;28 pages. Continuing on, when the Senate and Congressional investigators discovered that a landlord of some of the hijackers was evidently working with Saudi Intelligence agents and even worse he was an FBI Informant, it became obvious this person is to be questioned. According to the Joint Inquiry report&#8230;. &#8220;Several questions remain, however, with regard to the informants credibility.&#8221; &#8220;First, while there are several indications suggesting that future hijacker Hani Hanjour had contact with the informant in December 2000, the informant has repeatedly advised the FBI that the informant does not recognize photos of Hanjour. Second, the informant told the FBI that the hijackers did nothing to arouse the informants suspicion, but the informant also acknowledged that al-Hazmi had contacts with at least four individuals the informant knew were of interest to the FBI and about whom the informant had previously reported to the FBI. Third, the informant has made numerous inconsistent statements to the FBI during the course of interviews after September 11, 2001. Fourth, the informants responses during an FBI polygraph examination to very specific questions about the informants advance knowledge of the September 11 plot were judged by the FBI to be inconclusive, although the FBI asserts that this type of result is not unusual for such individuals in such circumstances.&#8221; &#8220;Finally, there is also information which conflicts with the information provided by the informant concerning the dates of contacts with the hijackers. The Joint Inquiry, for example, brought to the FBIs attention information that is inconsistent with the date of initial contact as provided by the informant. In its November 18, 2002 written response to the Joint Inquiry, the FBI has acknowledged that there are significant inconsistencies in the informants statements about these contacts.&#8221; page 51/858 http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/pdf/fullreport_errata.pdf But Bush steps in and kills this investigation at this point. And this paragraph alone is the proof of Obstruction of Justice&#8230;.. &#8220;The Administration has to date objected to the Inquirys efforts to interview the informant in order to attempt to resolve those inconsistencies. The Administration also would not agree to allow the FBI to serve a Committee subpoena and deposition notice on the informant. Instead, written interrogatories from the Joint Inquiry were, at the suggestion of the FBI, provided to the informant. Through an attorney, the informant has declined to respond to those interrogatories and has indicated that, if subpoenaed, the informant would request a grant of immunity prior to testifying.&#8221; http://www.gpoaccess.gov/serialset/creports/pdf/fullreport_errata.pdf I believe that satisfies this requirement&#8230; &#8220;Obstruction of justice in the federal courts is governed by a series of criminal statutes (18 U.S.C.A.  1501-1517), which aim to protect the integrity of federal judicial proceedings as well as agency and congressional proceedings. Section 1503 is the primary vehicle for punishing those who obstruct or who endeavor to obstruct federal judicial proceedings.&#8221; &#8220;To obtain a conviction under section 1503, the government must prove that there was a pending federal judicial proceeding, the defendant knew of the proceeding, and the defendant had corrupt intent to interfere with or attempted to interfere with the proceeding.&#8221; http://www.answers.com/topic/obstruction-of-justice Or maybe it isn&#8217;t as important as this&#8230;.. &#8220;Federal obstruction of justice statutes have been used to prosecute government officials who have sought to prevent the disclosure of damaging information. The Watergate scandal of the 1970s involving President Richard M. Nixon is a classic example of this type of obstruction. A number of Nixon&#8217;s top aides were convicted of obstruction of justice, including former attorney general John N. Mitchell. A federal grand jury named Nixon himself as an unindicted coconspirator for the efforts to prevent disclosure of White House involvement in the 1972 burglary of Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate building complex in Washington, D.C.&#8221; http://www.answers.com/topic/obstruction-of-justice Or how about this&#8230;.. &#8220;President Clinton was famously accused of obstruction of justice during the 1999 impeachment trial. The charge stated he attempted to &#8220;delay, impede, cover up and conceal evidence&#8221; in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.&#8221; http://ask.yahoo.com/20040709.html The Proof of Treason: This same Prince Bandar&#8230;. &#8220;Sources close to the case told TIME that beginning in J...
