By Rebecca Wolfson Special to amNewYork  The financial industry is battered, but that doesnt mean New Yorks landscape of bank branches is withering.  TD Bank in particular has an aggressive growth strategy. The Canadian bank that took over Commerce in 2007 has plans for five to nine new city branches this year, said spokeswoman Rebecca Acevedo.   Faith Hope Consolo, the head of retail leasing at Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that banks have not become the retail sore spot that many were predicting. Private banking will become more important because people are going to want to go somewhere they can talk about their money personally, she said.  New banks are still opening; theyre just in smaller spaces and at rents that are 25 percent lower than they were last year, Consolo said.  Bank of America still sees a tremendous opportunity in New York, said spokeswoman Anne Pace. We have no plans to close any banking centers in 2009.  The company plans to open a Bryant Park branch this year.  However, Citigroup is retrenching and JPMorgan Chase is closing branches after its merger with Washington Mutual, Consolo noted. Chase will close 32 branches by late summer. Some will be the two-story mega-bank variety, Consolo said.  The cutbacks, however, still leave 500 Chase branches for New Yorkers, hardly a shortage.  Chase and WaMu customers will have many more branches to bank at, said Mike Fusco, a spokesman for Chase.
