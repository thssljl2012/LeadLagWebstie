           But this is downright stupid! Bank of America, in an attempt to curry favor with a major customer, effectively moved a branch into his office. The only problem was the ponzi scheme he was running. According to the suit, representatives of Bank of America worked directly out of Mr. Cosmos West Hempstead office, which was about 30 miles from the branch where Agape and Mr. Cosmo maintained their bank accounts. In addition, Bank of America provided on-site representatives at Agape with bank equipment and computer systems that allowed direct access to the banks accounts and systems, the suit said.Essentially, Bank of America established a fully functional bank branch manned by its own representatives within Agapes offices, which is contrary to normal banking practices, the lawsuit said. As a result, the banks representatives had actual knowledge that Mr. Cosmo was diverting money to his own account and engaging in virtually no legitimate business whatsoever.In a complaint filed against Mr. Cosmo in January by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the government contends that from 2004 to 2008, Mr. Cosmo operated a fraudulent trading scheme in which investors were solicited to provide short-term bridge loans but that the money instead went into commodities trading contracts that lost money.As long as you "make your numbers" each month, we can overlook a few problems, right?
