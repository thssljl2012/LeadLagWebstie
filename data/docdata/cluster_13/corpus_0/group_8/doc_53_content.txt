It was seconded by another board member.If it is postponed, it would mark a major victory for the Kingsbridge Armory Redevelopment Alliance which demanded the vote be postponed until Related sits down with them to negotiate a community benefits agreement (CBA). Related has been reluctant to do so leading up to the IDA's meeting.Stay tuned...
