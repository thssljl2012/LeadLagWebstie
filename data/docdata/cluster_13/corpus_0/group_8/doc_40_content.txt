     No coincidence.&#0160; Both Bank of America and GM had contacted me about full-time speechwriting jobs.&#0160; That was already at a time when senior executives at many other companies were throwing together some bullet points and speaking from the heart.&#0160;&#0160;Delivering&#0160;anything from a set, highly polished text was, like, so&#0160;Organization Man.&#0160; And, horrors, having speechwriters on staff was kind&#0160;of low-decadent, not even camp. Yet, BoA and GM&#0160;still had traditional speechwriting jobs.&#0160; Now look where both companies are.&#0160; Perhaps security analysts should check out the employee&#0160;roster in communications.&#0160; If there are speechwriters listed, then downgrade the company stock to a sell. &#0160;
