Add one more voice to the anti-AIG outrage.  The community group formed to oppose the Atlantic Yards development in Brooklyn is crying foul over the news that Barclay's Bank, which in 2007 inked a $400 million naming rights deal for the proposed Nets arena, received money from AIG.  The insurance giant, which got $170 billion from taxpayers, released a list Sunday of financial institutions that benefitted from some of those loans, including Barclay's, which got $8.5 billion.  "Thus the American taxpayer is, in essence, picking up the tab for a British banks $400 million vanity project," said a statement from the group Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn.  The connection is, at best, indirect, considering the arena hasn't even broken ground and the ultimate fate of the project is still up in the air.  The group sought to link the issue to Citigroup's naming rights deal at the Mets' new stadium, Citi Field, a contract that has been criticized in light of the bailout funds the bank received.
