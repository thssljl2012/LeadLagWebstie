March 5, 2009 Who is buying up American Gun companies?This is an excellent article by Chris Bollyn concerning the ongoing fraud and financial scandal involving Mr. Madoff.  This sordid business is just one part of the ongoing looting of the USA. (This is definitely something you will not hear on the evening news.)  What I found very interesting is the discussion of Mr. Feinberg, Chairman of the powerful Cerburus private equity investment fund.  Mr. Feinberg is well connnected to the neocons, AIPAC, all of the major zionist orgs, and that intelligence agency that starts with the letters Mo.   Cerburus, which is the name for the three headed dog that protects the gates of hell,  is a financial monster.  It owns massive chunks of U.S. corporation, including GMAC and Chrysler.  What makes me very nervous is that Mr. Feinberg, in the last two years, has been buying up American Firearms companies.   Those companies, as of now, which are owned directly or indirectly by cerburus  include Remington, Bushmaster, DPMS, Marlin, Cobb Mfg. and H&amp;R.  The gun business has never been much of a money maker.  Why would Cerburus be interested?  This reminds me when an Iranian banking family bought Colt firearms, (at that time it was bankrupt,) and promptly discontinued all civilian sales.  It was obvious that this was done, not as a business decision but as a political decision.  The good news was, that Colt's idiotic action prompted an explosion of companies who went out and made "black rifles" which were better than the ones built by Colt.  Two of those, I think, were DPMS and Bushmaster.  Are we going to see a replay of this action ? Why do I smell a rat?           Subject: The Powers Protecting Madoffhttp://www. bollyn. info/home/articles/911/another-massive-zionist-fraud-surfaces/ FRAUDSTER'S PARTNERS ARE TIED TO SENIOR ISRAELI CRIMINALS AND ISRAEL'S NOTORIOUS MONEY-LAUNDERING BANK IN NEW YORK - SO, WHERE DID THE MONEY GO? Where did the Madoff money go?  Said to be as much as $50 billion, the key question about this huge scam remains unanswered.  After examining 7,000 boxes containing the documents of Bernard Madoff's "investment" company, a U.S. bankruptcy court meeting revealed that there was "no evidence" that any of the money had been re-invested in 13 years, the BBC reported on February 21, 2009: ".trolling through 7,000 boxes of records dating back 13 years, investigators found no evidence that money paid into the fund offering high rates of return had been re-invested.  The monthly statements, they said, "no more than fiction."Suggested Viewing:  "Madoff money 'never re-invested'," BBC News, February 21, 2009Meanwhile, with incredible arrogance, Madoff is asking the court that he be allowed to keep some $69 million in assets, saying that they are in his wife's name, according to an AP report:Bernard Madoff is seeking to keep a $7 million Manhattan penthouse and an additional $62 million in assets, saying they are unrelated to the fraud that authorities say cost victims more than $50 billion. In court papers filed Monday, March 2, in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Madoff and his lawyer claim the apartment, $45 million in municipal bonds and $17 million more in a separate account all belong to Madoff's wife, Ruth.The bonds in an account held by Ruth Madoff at COHMAD Securities Corp. and about $17 million held by her in a Wachovia Bank account "are unrelated to the alleged Madoff fraud and only Ruth Madoff has a beneficial interest in these assets," Bernard Madoff and lawyer Ira Sorkin said, according to the papers. Source: Neumeister, Larry, "Madoff seeks to keep NYC penthouse, $62M in assets," Associated Press, March 2, 2009Stephen A. Weiss, a lawyer who represents about 100 defrauded investors, said investors won't stand for the Madoffs keeping millions of dollars."Bernie Madoff has no shortage of chutzpah to suggest as he does that his wife was not the beneficiary of his fraud. It is not only senseless, but offensive," Weiss said after the court hearing on March 3.The "chutzpah" of Madoff described in the news reports indicates that Madoff is being very well protected by the highest authority in New York and the United States government.  After nearly three months, the investigators have not charged Madoff with any crime and he is still allowed to live in his $7 million penthouse -- a home paid for with stolen money while some of his victims have been made homeless by his crimes.   MADOFF'S ARROGANCE Where does Bernie Madoff get his arrogance and hubris, the "chutzpah" Weiss referred to?  There can only be explanation:  he knows that he is being protected by the highest power -- and I don't mean our heavenly Father.  Madoff is being protected by his partners in crime, the Elders of Zion, and the State of Israel.  The $50 billion did not disappear into an unknown black hole.  Such large sums do not simply vanish; these transfers of hundreds of millions are being kept hidden by the investigators and the courts.  They have most likely been funneled into Zionist-controlled bank accounts through Israeli banks (e.g. Israel Discount Bank) and private equity funds managed by Israeli intelligence.  Madoff has been funding the war chest of Israeli inteligence.  As long as Madoff remains silent about this core aspect of the rip-off, he will be allowed to live and justice will be easy with him.  This is the quid pro quo of his relationship with Israel and the source of his confidence.  He was stealing for a cause - the Zionist cause.  Why else have the powerful Zionist individuals and groups supposedly defrauded by Madoff not gone after him tooth-and-nail as they would an Arab or suspected Nazi?  Why has the Zionist-controlled media failed to investigate where Madoff's billions disappeared to?  Why is Madoff being treated with kid gloves by the court and the media?  As we can clearly see from the delayed and obstructed 9-11 tort litigation, the New York courts and U.S. mass media are Zionist controlled instruments of injustice. Madoff, the criminal Zionist treasurer, has been under home detention since being charged with the theft of as much as $50 billion in early December 2008 (he has had a curfew between 7 p.m. and 9 a.m.).  This freedom allowed him to continue to run his criminal enterprise and send millions of dollars of ill-gotten gains to his family and friends.  Why has Madoff not been treated like a criminal, water-boarded in Gitmo, and interrogated? His friends think that is the way to treat people who are suspected of having information that is important to the welfare of the American people.  Why the special treatment for Madoff?  He should hire his own security?  What kind of joke is this?  The judge who has been so lenient with Madoff is Gabriel W. Gorenstein."It's all just one big lie." - Bernard Madoff to his sons about his $50 billion "Ponzi" schemeFraudster Bernard L. Madoff was national treasurer of the American Jewish Congress and Yeshiva University (YU).  His business partner at YU was Sy Syms, the long-standing director of the notorious Israel Discount Bank of New York, a bank charged for laundering tens of billions of dollars in 2005.  So where did the $50 billion go?  The evidence suggests that a large amount of money went to the Zionist criminal network headed by Ehud Olmert and his cronies.(This article has been read by more than 29,000 people; March 4, 2009) If a string of similar crimes are committed in the same city by a gang of close associates from the same ethnic group with the same extremist political ideology, one would naturally think there could be a connection.  This is precisely the case with the huge financial frauds that have struck New York investment banks, insurance companies, and hedge funds.  All of the key players in the current financial crisis are Zionist Jews from a very small political/ethnic community in New York City.  But don't expect CNN or the New York Times to fill you in on the details -- the owners of these institutions are part of the same "community."I have been pointing out the Zionist connections in 9-11 for more than 7 years and the same connections behind the current financial crisis since September.  I have been accused of being an anti-Semite because of my research.  For American Zionists and "philo-Semites" who genuflect at the word "Jew" it seems that pointing out the Zionist Jew behind a crime is actually worse that the commission of the crime itself.   Indoctrinated by the Zionist-controlled mass media, most Americans are simply unaware that all of the key players in 9-...
