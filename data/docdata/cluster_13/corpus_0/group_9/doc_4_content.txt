 Civil War is Coming to Costa Mesa, California May 9 &amp; May 10 out at Fairview Park in Costa Mesa there will be a Civil War Reenactment taking place!!! This is the first time we have ever had such an event in Costa Mesa and the non profit group who puts it on needs your help and support! There is also a perfect opportunity to get in on advertising by setting up a booth at the event. They are in need of food vendors to feed the hungry soldiers for the 2 days also. So if you are interested in attending, helping out or being a vendor call me at the chamber and I will give you the correct contact information.
