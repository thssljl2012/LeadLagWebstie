Atlanta GA. Jan 23 2009Brett DavisStaff Reporterwww.privateofficer.comA Brinks armored truck guard who police say fired his handgun at the car of two men after they allegedly tried to rob him last week is viewed as a hero to some. But some county officials see him as a lawbreaker and they want to arrest him.According to police, Christopher Delarosa, 19, of Billerica confronted the armored car guard outside a Bank of America ATM kiosk at the Riversedge Plaza last Wednesday, punched him in the face and tried to take a bag of money away from him. Witnesses told police they had seen the guard struggling with a man wearing a mask.Police said that Delarosa and the guard struggled and that when he could not get control of the money bag, the robber he fled in a silver Toyota driven by Isaac Sosa, 18, of Lawrence.Authorities say that as the car was driving away, the guard fired his handgun several times, striking the rear of the car and this is where some officials believe the guard broke the law.Police say that they are considering filing criminal charges against the guard as well, however, for firing his weapon at an unarmed, fleeing suspect. According to Deputy Chief Donald Thompson, it would be illegal "99 percent of the time" for an officer to fire a gun in those circumstances."The officer would have to believe the escape of the suspect would be a serious threat to the community," Thompson said.Delarosa and Sosa were later arrested just across the state line in Plaistow, N.H. They were arraigned in Haverhill District Court on Thursday, charged with unarmed robbery.And the attorney for Delarosa contended in court that it was the guard who attacked his client, not the other way around.Clearly, not only are there two very different versions of what happened, the investigation of the firing of the gun has barely begun.That has not stopped either speculation or debate over what is obviously a very volatile issue. Defenders of the guard say anyone in fear for his own safety, and in the heat of the moment, would react the same way  that he may have thought there was a gun in the car.Others say any trained officer  a policeman or a Brinks guard  should know enough not to fire at a fleeing suspect who does not pose an immediate, direct threat. Those given weapons of deadly force are supposed to be trained in restraint.The security officer could face felony charges in this incident and jail time.JOIN THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF PRIVATE OFFICERSwww.privateofficer.com/Get news alerts, officer down, weather emergency news in your mailbox!
