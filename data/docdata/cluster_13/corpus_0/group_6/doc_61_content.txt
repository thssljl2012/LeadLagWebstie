from Stephen Brunt of the Globe and Mail,   How is it the NHLPA, under its newest executive director, Paul Kelly, is expected to announce Friday its membership has declined to reopen its collective agreement with the league, as is its right, and will play on under the current contract until 2011?   That deal, cut under duress, cut after their union was effectively broken, is working just fine for the players, thanks. They&#8217;ll say all the right things about not wanting a labour disruption during these trying economic times, but the bottom line is they continue to earn loads of dough in a vigorous market for talent, while league owners are faced with several teams now teetering on the brink of insolvency....

If they&#8217;re still in business come 2011 &#8212; and who would like to bet their life on that right now? &#8212; the next labour war won&#8217;t cure what&#8217;s wrong with them, either.   read on
