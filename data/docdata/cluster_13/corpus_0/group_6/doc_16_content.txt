Daily Real Estate News   January 14, 2009 A Seattle couple have filed suit against Countrywide mortgage company, claiming that it violates the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Practices (RICO) Act when it hires its wholly owned subsidiary LandSafe for appraisals. The suit says, Countrywide, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America, forces home owners to use LandSafe, then subcontracts the work to independent appraisers while charging homeowners as much as 200 percent of the cost of the appraisals. The suit also contends that if independent appraisers do not accept Countrywide&#8217;s fee structure or appraisal guidelines, they stand the risk of being blacklisted. The suit was filed by Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro on behalf of Carol and Gregory Clark in U.S. District Court in Seattle. The suit seeks class action status to represent all home owners who purchased or refinanced their homes through Countrywide and LandSafe. Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro (01/13/09)
