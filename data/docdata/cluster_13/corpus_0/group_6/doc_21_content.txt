Standard and Poor&#8217;s Rating yesterday&#8217;s news By Stephen Pate NJN Network News January 15th, 2009 The story Islanders still spending but for how long? sparked an interesting comment from a Guardian reader in Summerside who said,&#8221;PEI still has an excellent credit rating and will have no problems running a deficit, especially since PEI is not feeling the impacts of other parts of the country/world. Canada has not experienced the problems in the US. Provinces here have no worries of not being able to finance a deficit.&#8221; Treasurer Wes Sheridan, the former loans manager from Kensington, is in way over his head. He just repeats what people tell him with very little understanding. Deputy Paul Jelly is Sheridan&#8217;s only hope and this is way beyond Jelly&#8217;s skill level. No one can predict how deep the trough of this depression will get so past experience is useless.  Standard and Poor&#8217;s rating is old news The Standard and Poor&#8217;s &#8220;A&#8221; rating is dated October 23rd, 2008  which would be a light year ago in this crisis. Things have gone to hell in a hand basket around the world since October. The people PEI dealt with for borrowing are probably not working today as almost 300,000 bankers have been laid off around the world. The number is expected to go over 500,000. Federal Finance Minister Flaherty was lying to Canadians that things were rosy as late as November 28, 2008. His economic statement almost lost Harper the government when the Opposition parties tried a putsch in mid-December based on non-confidence in his outlook. Today, the mayors of all Canadian cities are crying at Minister Baird&#8217;s table because they have run out of money and can&#8217;t borrow. The Mayor of Toronto admitted he can&#8217;t borrow on CBC news tonight. Toronto, one of Canada&#8217;s richest cities, has an operating budget of $8.8 billion. Where is the money? When the big boys can&#8217;t borrow, PEI is out in the cold. Unless PEI has significant reserves of cash, it will soon have to start cutting expenses since there is precious little money to borrow anywhere in the world. There is money in China and some in the Middle East. It is going to only the best prospects and a little province that cannot support itself is not in the club. Middle Eastern money is getting scarce as well with the lowered oil price. Cash is king these days. The layoffs in the banking industry are mounting every day: Lehman 150,000, Bank of America 10,000, Merrill Lynch 30,000, J. P. Morgan 9,000 - over 250,000 announced as of early January 2009. It is expected to top 500,000 bankers by June and that&#8217;s not including all the lawyers and accountants redundant in the crunch. 60% of Venture Cap businesses expects to see significant reductions in business in 2009. A new term is being coined instead of layoff - taking off the handcuffs. Translation - go find something to kill and eat on your own. If you&#8217;re still at your desk next month we may have to write you a letter. Don&#8217;t try to collect salary. Times are tough. Anyone who loans money to PEI will put stringent terms on the loan vis a vis interest rates and conditions of reducing operating deficits, if we can find someone to play ball with us. Batten down the hatches. I hope I&#8217;m wrong.
