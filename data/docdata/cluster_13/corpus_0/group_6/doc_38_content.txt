My regular readers should appreciate this one:  Remember back in December, when I laid out the whole Blagojevich affair? Short version: Blagojevich threatened to stop Illinois from doing business with the Bank of America, and the very next day, he was dragged out of his house on federal corruption charges. Well it turns out, that may not be the end of the story. Remember the Miracle on the Hudson? Well as it turns out, 23 of the 155 passengers on that plane were on the board of directors for...you guessed it, Bank of America. And the plane got taken out by suckinga Canada goose into each engine simultaneously?  Isn't it fun watching them feed on eachother like this?
