  Ever since 9/11, taking a photo of certain downtown buildings was verboten.  Well, that's according to said building's security guards.  So last Sunday, a group of photographers went out to take photos of downtown buildings from public sidewalks to protest their rights. Six security guards quickly responded. Drama ensues.  Oooohhhh.  Aaaahhhh.  The real kicker is when one of the photographers call the LAPD and they refuse to come respond because the photographers are in the legal right (better heard on this recording).  Still, security continues to argue with with one of them calling, supposedly the supervisor, calling them idiots multiple times.
