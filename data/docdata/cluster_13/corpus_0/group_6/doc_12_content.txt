Had a really, really great meeting today with my District Manager for Avon. Wasn&amp;#8217;t sure how long she was going to be visiting today. You think for giving the run down to a new rep, maybe half an hour? 45 Minutes? She was here for 3 hours. She said we covered a lot more material then she normally does, she thinks I will do well because of how the training for sales at my current employer has really prepared me. Selling Avon compared to when I did Bank of America, this is going to be so much more fun and so much easier. I&amp;#8217;m really excited and can&amp;#8217;t wait to get started. I&amp;#8217;m supposed to meet with her again on the 26th, insha&amp;#8217;allah. I am going to ask on Monday at work if we can change our schedule around that day so I can go. I&amp;#8217;ve been praying to Allah for a long time now, to show me a way out of my riba job. Insha&amp;#8217;allah this is my way and I will keep praying that he grants me success in this.
