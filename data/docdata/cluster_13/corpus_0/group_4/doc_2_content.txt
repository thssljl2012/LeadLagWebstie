November 4, 2008Dear students,In light of the recent issues regarding the impeachment of Mr. Juan Miguel Martin Ng Tirona, we are writing this letter to resolve the concerns and to clarify matters on the concluded proceedings.Mr. Juan Miguel Tirona is not being accused of malversation of funds but of poor record keeping and negligence in accounting. Mr. Juan Miguel Tirona did not spend any of the BAC funds under his custody for purposes other than what was authorized to be spent by the BAC. The decision to hold the BAC funds was temporarily agreed upon by Mr. Juan Miguel Tirona as Chairperson, Ms. Bernica Marquez as Vice-Chairperson and Mr. Patrick Carbonell as Councilor for Finance until the BAC funds are transferred from the custody of BAC of 2008 to BAC of 2009.Mr. Juan Miguel Tirona was impeached because the BAC members believe that his leadership is not fit to what we deem to be appropriate of a Chairperson, therefore resulting to an inability to motivate, inspire and lead the council.We apologize for the stress and setbacks that the past events have brought upon the college and the administration. Rest assured that the BAC will continue to work on its line up of value-adding projects and initiatives for the CBA community and that the council will always be of service to the college.Thank you and God Bless!Sincerely,Carlo AbanesBianca BorlagonPatrick CarbonellBrian CatbaganEnglebert ChuaEmanette CrisostomoKatrina CruzKyle DaelPatricia De JesusEdgar Delas AlasCJ Delos SantosRayzel EnriquezNorberto GeraldezRichelle LansangRaymund LiBrenda MagaoayBernica MarquezPatricia Ann RodriguezJose Rafael SantosRachelle SisonBea TrinidadHailin QuintosLeigh Wong
