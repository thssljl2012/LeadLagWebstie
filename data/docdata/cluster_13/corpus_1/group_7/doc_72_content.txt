Two downtown Orlando restaurants that have been in business for nearly 15 years have closed. Harveys Bistro and Manuels on the 28th both in the Bank of America Center on Orange Avenue and Livingston Street closed for business Feb. 16 after deciding not to renew the leases.  The restaurants, both owned by Manny Garcia and Hal Valdes, were unable to reach a reasonable lease with building landlord Miami-based Americas Capital Partners, according to general manager Benj Ray.  Ray added that owners of other downtown buildings have approached the company about reopening the restaurants in other locations, but declined to disclose further details.  Garcia and Valdes were unavailable for comment, as was Americas Capital Partners. Harveys Bistro, which was open for lunch and dinner Monday through Friday and dinner only on Saturday, was on the ground-level of the Bank of America Center. Manuels on the 28th the top-story, fine-dining restaurant in the building served dinner Tuesday through Saturday.
