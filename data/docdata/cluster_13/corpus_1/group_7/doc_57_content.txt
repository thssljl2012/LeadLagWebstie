On the 10th day since his daughter's disappearance, Ronald Cummings held a press conference to make yet another plea for the return of his 5-year-old daughter, Haleigh, and dispel rumors that an acquaintance of his might be involved in the child's abduction. 'I don't have any enemies,' said Cummings, 25, to members of the media at about 1 p.m., while his mother stood by. 'I don't have any suspects.' He directed specific questions on the investigation to law enforcement.  A representative of Watts Funeral Home in San Mateo also announced at the press conference that an account, the Haleigh Cummings Donation Fund, has been opened with Bank of America.  Teresa Neves, Haleigh's paternal grandmother, said she was grateful for the investigative work by law enforcement and said the family is hopeful of the girl's return.
