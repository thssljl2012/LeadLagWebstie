9:50 a.m. Feb. 23  Lawmakers just approved Sen. Benjamin Cruz's amendment, with 10 senators raising their hand in support.  Cruz's amendment to Bill 51 would prohibit any GovGuam official from paying or transferring funds for the purpose of complying with the Feb. 13 order by District Court of Guam Chief Judge Frances Tydingco-Gatewood.  GovGuam was ordered to pay nearly $1 million per week starting March 1 for the landfill project in Inarajan. The government had already deposited $20 million to Citibank for those projects, which are slated to start Wednesday.  In total, the cost of closing the Ordot dump and building a new landfill is expected to cost Guam about $160 million, according to the court-appointed federal receiver. Bill 51 is Gov. Felix Camacho's financing plan for those projects.
