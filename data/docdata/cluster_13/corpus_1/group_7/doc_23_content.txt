Citizens Security Bank, member ANZ Group of companies, yesterday launched its new Trade and Foreign Exchange platform. 'Trade and foreign exchange are critical to Guam -- it is estimated that Guam imports over $250 million worth of goods annually from outside of the United States,' said David McCall, ANZ president on Guam and CEO for American territories. 'Our new Trade and FX platform gives Guam businesses greater flexibility when conducting business in the international marketplace, and the convenience of working with (foreign exchange) and trade specialists who are available locally.' In July 2007, Citizens Security Bank formally became a member of the Australia &amp; New Zealand, or ANZ, Group of Companies.
