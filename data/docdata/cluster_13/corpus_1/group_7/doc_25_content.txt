By late afternoon yesterday, 38,000 average Australians had donated more than $6.8 million to the Victorian Bushfire Appeal.  The number of people wanting to donate was so great the Red Cross website and phone room could barely cope.  Their overwhelming generosity was boosted by government contributions and the corporate sector.  While the Federal and Victorian governments kicked-in $2 million each, the Queensland and West Australian governments pledged $1 million and Brisbane City Council promised $200,000.  Among the corporate donors, News Limited, publisher of The Courier-Mail, pledged $1 million towards the appeal.  'This unprecedented national tragedy warrants an unprecedented response,' chief executive John Hartigan said.  Gaming giant Tabcorp donated $2 million to the fund.  Australia's four biggest banks, the NAB, ANZ, Westpac and CBA each pledged $1 million, as did AMP, the Macquarie Group and Woolworths.  Foster's gave $750,000, while Wesfarmers, Crown and insurance group Suncorp each donated $500,000.  Telstra pledged $500,000 and said it would match donations by its employees up to $250,000. Coles will donate the profits from its 750 stores on Friday.  Cricket fans will be urged to donate to the bushfire appeal during tonight's one-day match between Australia and New Zealand, with Cricket Australia kicking in $100,000 and the proceeds of remaining ticket sales.
