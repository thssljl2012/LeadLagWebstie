An Nigerian man has become famous for allegedly convincing Citibank to wire him US$27 million in one month.  Prosecutors say Citibank in New York transferred money last October to Paul Gabriel Amos, 37, who had convinced the bank to wire the money to the National Bank of Ethiopia, from where it was withdrawn.  Amos was arrested last month as he tried to enter the United States.  He has pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank wire fraud.  The money has since been recovered and credited back to Citibank.
