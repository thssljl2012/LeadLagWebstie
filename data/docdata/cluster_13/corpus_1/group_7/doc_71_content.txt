LEBANON  Sentencing for Barbara Joly, the woman dubbed the 'granny robber' by police, has been moved to Wednesday, Feb. 18, in Warren County Common Pleas Court.  Joly pled guilty to robbing a Franklin bank in November, the U.S. Bank in Lebanon on Sept. 24 and People's First Savings Bank in Mason on May 29. She has already been sentenced to three years in jail by a Butler County judge for robbing a Middletown bank.  Joly's sentencing for her Warren County robberies was originally scheduled for Friday, Feb. 20. The Warren County Prosecutor's Office said the hearing date was moved ahead two days to ensure that the sentencing occurred before Joly was moved from the Butler County jail. Joly's sentencing is scheduled for 2 p.m.
