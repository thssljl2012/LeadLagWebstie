In response to questioning from Rep.   Keith Ellison  , D-Minn., at yesterday's hearing on TARP accountability, Mr. Lewis said he agreed with the principle that TARP funds 'should be used to either recapitalize the banks or to otherwise promote solvency within the bank and promote lending and not to try to impact or defeat any measures in Congress to promote union organizing.' But when pressed on Bank of America's own anti-worker activities, Mr. Lewis qualified his position, saying that Bank of America's TARP funds are 'forty-five billion in the context of 230 billion in equity.'

The seven partner unions are: International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Laborers' International Union of North America
