THEY may be outside the bushfire zone and mostly on opposite sides of a debate, but local parliamentarians have united in their support of the bushfire victims.  Western Metropolitan MLC Bernie Finn and Kororoit MLA Marlene Kairouz are both hosting chapters of the State Governments official condolence book.  Mr Finn said he was pleased to be able to assist in a small way.  Ms Kairouz said the message books were a small way of sending thanks to everybody involved in the fire recovery efforts.  Gorton Federal MP Brendan OConnor said many of his constituents had reported friends and family among the dead, missing or homeless. Maribyrnong MP Bill Shorten echoed Mr OConnors sentiments.  Donate to the bushfire appeal by phoning 1800 811 700, or through any NAB, ANZ, Westpac or Commonwealth Bank branch or any Bunnings store, or by directing deposit to the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund  BSB: 082-001, account number: 860-046-797.
