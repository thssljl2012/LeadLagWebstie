MADISON - The Wisconsin Department of Justice has reached a huge settlement with mortgage giant Countrywide Financial Corp. over questionable marketing practices.  The deal comes after 11 states, including Illinois and California, reached similar settlements with Countrywide in October over allegations the lender misrepresented its terms.  In the deal announced Thursday, Countrywide agreed to modify subprime and adjustable rate loans for about 3,000 borrowers, pay the state about $1.6 million for foreclosure relief efforts and waive delinquency, modification fees and other penalties.  The Justice Department says if every eligible borrower participates, the settlement will be worth about $40 million.  A message left with a spokesman for Bank of America, Countrywides parent company, wasnt immediately returned.
