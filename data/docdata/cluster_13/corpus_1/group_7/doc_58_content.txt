TWIN FALLS, Idaho Twin Falls County commissioners have voted to pay $10,000 to the Bank of America to settle about $20,000 in outstanding credit card debt accumulated by the sheriff's office.  Commissioners on Friday approved the deal negotiated by Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loebs.  Commissioner Tom Mikesell said Loebs told commissioners their only feasible option was 'to stop the bleeding.'The former county sheriff, Wayne Tousley, has said the amount owed on the credit cards through Bank of America was typically paid off each month. But he said any late fees and finance charges apparently were put on a separate corporate account over what he estimated to be the last 13 years.  He became aware of the nearly $20,000 debt in June when his credit card was denied because the debt on the corporate account was reaching its limit of $25,000.'I still feel it was the bank's doing, and I didn't catch it in time,' Tousley told The Times-News.  Loebs said the bank had been cooperative and professional during the two-month negotiations.'I think they were reasonable,' Loebs said.Loebs had previously said the county might not be allowed to pay all the money back because state law restricts paying charges more than a year old.  The new sheriff, Tom Carter, beat Tousley in the Nov. 4 election and was sworn in Jan. 12. Carter said he's glad the problem is resolved and the sheriff's office can move forward.'I am pleased with this settlement,' Carter said.County commissioners George Urie and Terry Kramer said the county's credit-card policy doesn't need to be changed. The policy, last revised in 2003, requires original receipts for all claims, and for payments to be made on a timely basis.'The new policy is working well,' said Kramer. 'We will certainly continue to look for any weak spots in this.'
