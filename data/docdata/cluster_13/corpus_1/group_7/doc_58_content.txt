 Written by Kevin Kerrigan  Guam  Guam - The latest wrinkleinthelandfill controversy has now cropped up between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Guam's own EPA.  An order issued by District Court todaytakes note that despite the Federal Court's order that both Guam and U.S. EPAsubmit a joint report outlining the permiting process for the Layon landfill, each agency submitted a seperate report.  District Court Judge Francis Tydingco-Gatewood notes the two EPA's differ on: the source of funding for a technical consultant; the source of funding for contract support; and the requirement that GEPA file monthly progress reports.  Never the less, the Judge ordered GEPA to use its best attempts to secure funding and if they can't she ordered GovGuam to file a motion requesting the money from the $20 million now on deposit at Citibank for construction of the landfill.  The Court alsonoted that it is 'undisputed' that GEPA is the permitting authority for the Layon landfill but added that GEPAmust comply with the deadlines approved by the court and she ordered GEPA touse all its available resources to ensure compliance.  In addition Judge Gatewood has ordered GEPA to submit monthly reports on the progress being made in the permitting process.
