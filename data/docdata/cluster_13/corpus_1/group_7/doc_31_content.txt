 Setting up a new life following a marriage breakdown can cost more than $100,000, according to a new online survey.  Dampening the romance of Valentine's Day, research by financial services institution Bankwest shows despite the volume of chocolates and flowers delivered on February 14, married couples most often break up at this time of year.  Nearly 19 per cent of people who took part in the survey, When Love Goes Wrong, estimated once a marriage was over, it cost more than $100,000 to start a new life.  The survey found one in four married couples bought a house together, while one in three took out a joint loan to purchase items including television sets, fridges, sofas and cars.  Nearly half lost friends, while 46 per cent said their social life improved as a result of splitting up. 'Our research showed nearly one in four people estimated it took longer than two years to get back on their feet financially after a split,' Bankwest head of strategy and products Selina Duncalf said in a statement on Wednesday.  She said people should get sound and independent advice on managing their finances after a separation.  Research for the When Love Goes Wrong survey was conducted online in late January.  Respondents included 470 Australians who had split from a relationship in the past five years.  AAP
