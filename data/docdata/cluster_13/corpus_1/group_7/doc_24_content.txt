The complaint in the initial action accuses the defendants of violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by virtue of the Company's failure to disclose during the Class Period the true financial condition of Merrill Lynch, a company acquired by Bank of America. The complaint in the newer action that has created the Extended Class Period does not include claims for holders of Bank of America shares on October 10, 2008 who were entitled to vote with respect to the acquisition of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America at a December 5, 2008 special meeting of Bank of America shareholders, but does claim that the Company's July 21, 2008 representations of the worst being behind on value declines was the start of a period of deception by Bank of America as to its prospects. According to both complaints, beginning on January 16, 2009, after the Company revealed the true extent of the deterioration of Merrill's financial condition, as evidenced by Merrill Lynch's $15 billion fourth quarter loss, the value of Bank of America's stock declined significantly.
