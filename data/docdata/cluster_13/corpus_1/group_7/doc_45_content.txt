A former Bank of America official has been sentenced to more than six years in prison for transporting thousands of dollars in stolen funds to a casino in Louisiana. Brent Steven Lemons, 53, of Arlington was also ordered Tuesday to pay $1.8 million in restitution to seven victims, said the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Texas. He pleaded guilty to transporting stolen funds across state lines and money laundering on Aug. 20.   Lemons, a senior vice president of investments and financial adviser at Banc of America Investment Services and president of the Tyler market of Bank of America, admitted withdrawing $80,000 from an investor's account without the persons knowledge and sending those funds to Boyd Corp., which is associated with Sams Town Casino in Shreveport, said the office of U.S. Attorney Rebecca Gregory.
