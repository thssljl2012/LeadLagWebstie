BALD Spur Road resident Alaina McKee barely escaped the Kinglake bushfire. Her house burned to the ground. She and her three children have only the clothes on their backs.  On Wednesday, she went to the Commonwealth Bank in Whittlesea to say that she had a $128,000 mortgage on a place that was no longer there.   She needs to rent a new house while the old place is rebuilt.   She says the teller told her she could suspend repayments but the interest would continue to build. 'They said to me, 'You're $41,000 ahead on the loan, so the interest will just come off that',' she said. 'I said, 'But that's still money I'm losing. I can't afford to lose more'.' The teller was adamant that nothing more could be done; other customers reported much the same message.   But yesterday - after Wayne Swan rang the bank's chief executive, Ralph Norris - the story changed. In a statement, the Commonwealth Bank 'confirmed its total support for the victims of the Victorian bushfires'. It also announced an emergency assistance package that means people will not have to pay interest on loans for houses that are no longer standing.
