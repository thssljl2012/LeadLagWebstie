Two fixtures of the downtown Orlando dining scene -- Harvey's Bistro and Manuel's on the 28th -- have closed. The two restaurants, both in the Bank of America building, served their last meals on Valentine's Day. The restaurants had not been able to reach agreement in lease negotiations with management, said Hal Valdes, a partner in the restaurants.
