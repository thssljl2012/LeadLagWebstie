The band will play on.  The River City Brass Band and its musicians have reached an agreement in principal on a new collective bargaining agreement whose steep cuts in pay will mean the group averts a shutdown.  After a meeting today with a federal mediator, committees representing both sides agreed to a contract that would require all employees, the unionized 28-member band and the seven staff members to take a 15 percent cut in pay, effective until June 2010. The number of rehearsals will not be changed this spring (currently four plus one dress rehearsal) for the musicians who are paid per-service, but in fall they will be reduced to three plus the dress rehearsal. The compromised agreement is sufficient to meet the endowment's needs funding, says band management.  The band will rehearse tomorrow for the first time since December, then on Friday and Saturday, getting it ready to perform all of its remaining March concerts as the language of the new contract is hammered out and voted on. Those begin with a performance in Johnstown on March 1 at the Pasquerilla Arts Center.
