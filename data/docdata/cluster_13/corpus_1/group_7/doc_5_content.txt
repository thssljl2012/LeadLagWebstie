Wal-Mart has appointed deputy general counsel Jeff Gearhart as its new legal chief.  The US retail giant has promoted Gearhart to the role of general counsel following the appointment of previous GC Tom Mars as Wal-Marts first chief administration officer.  Gearhart, who became deputy general counsel in 2007, joined the company in 2003 as general counsel for the Wal-Mart corporate division. In his new position, he will be responsible for all legal matters affecting the team both in the US and abroad.  Mars will now be responsible for the companys compliance department as well as looking after human resources functions and employment matters for Wal-Mart US divisions.  Wal-Mart employees more than 2 million staff and has a turnover in excess of $400bn (280bn).  News of the changes at Wal-Mart come as fellow US giant AIG restructures its legal leadership.  The insurance company last month expanded the role of general counsel Anastasia Kelly last month, with Kelly now responsible for communications, corporate affairs and human resources.  Kelly, who previously dealt with global legal, compliance and regulatory matters, was also named as a vice chairman of the company and will report directly to chairman and chief executive Edward Liddy.
