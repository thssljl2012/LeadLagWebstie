 GREATER Taree City Council mayor Paul Hogan will personally support the appeal for Victorian fire victims and he is urging the Manning community to do the same.  The mayor said the weekends bushfire catastrophe was a tragedy beyond comprehension. The devastation and heartache... whole towns and families destroyed, he said. You can never replace a life.  I will be thinking of the victims  they are in my prayers.  Yesterday the firestorm death toll climbed above 100, with the towns of Kingland and Marysville wiped out and at least 750 homes destroyed. Arsonists are believed to be responsible and a police taskforce is being established to investigate.
