Detectives investigating wednesday's ATM robbery at Latrobe are concerned similar crimes could become more widespread.  The Latrobe branch of the ANZ bank was badly damaged in an explosion and a large amount of cash was stolen from the ATM.  There've been several incidents recently of thieves blowing up ATMs in Sydney.  Detective Inspector Mark Wright says there hasn't been an arrest in the Latrobe case, and he's not sure if the culprits are locals or from interstate.  But he's concerned there could be copycat robberies.
