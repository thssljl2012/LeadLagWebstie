Heller Ehrman paid out more than $7m (4.8m) to 35 departing or retiring partners in 2008,  by the firm has revealed. The filing paints a picture of Heller's shrinking capital coffers as a steady stream of partners left during 2008. The departures led to the firm having its accounts frozen after breaking a loan covenant, which precipitated its collapse.  The document also shows who Heller's creditors could target as they seek to be paid through Heller's bankruptcy, which was filed on 28 December. Creditors can try to reclaim payments dating back as far as four years.  Thomas Willoughby of Felderstein Fitzgerald Willoughby &amp; Pascuzzi, who is representing the creditors committee, said on Tuesday (24 February) that the committee will be looking at any payments that were made when the estate was insolvent or distributions that 'led to it being insolvent.' 'The recovery of distributions prior to the [bankruptcy] filing will be investigated,' Willoughby said, but added that he is also 'thinking about people way beyond shareholders,' who he declined to name. 'No, not the banks,' he said. Heller and the committee believe the banks, Bank of America and Citibank, are not secured creditors because of a 2007 'clerical error,' and that they should give back $50m (34.6m) paid them in the 90 days leading up to the bankruptcy.  The filing details capital distributions and amounts still owed to 53 partners who left, retired or were fired before 26 September.  At the same time, several former partners are on the creditors list, asserting claims for their capital.  The majority of the distributions, $5.3m (3.7m), went to 13 lawyers who received all of their capital because of a 'change of status or termination.' The highest distribution went to Douglas Schwab, a senior of counsel who retired in 2008 and was at Heller for more than 35 years, who received $920,000 (636,000). Dissolution committee member Paul Sugarman was also among the 13, and received $513,000 (355,000). Sugarman retired in early 2008.  Some partners collected 25% of their investment in the firm, and 40 of them collectively left behind $8m (5.5m) in capital. To accumulate capital, Heller would withhold between 7%-8.5% per year of each partner's profits, and withholdings would stop after a maximum was reached. A partner reaching 65 and retiring or switching to senior status received all capital back, according to two former partners.  Firms often take years to pay back capital contributions to partners who leave for other firms. In Heller's case in 2008, partners were paid 25% of their capital upon departure, with the expectation that 25% a year would be distributed over the following three years. By 1 June, however, the policy changed and partners who moved were told they would not begin to be paid until 2009, the two partners said.
