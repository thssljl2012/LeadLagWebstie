Emergency services were swamped by 903 calls for aid while the body of a man was found, one of two missing from a 4WD swept off the Bruce Highway near Tully on Sunday.  Although floods will ease overnight, the weather bureau warns rain will increase on Thursday.  Ingham, between Cairns and Townsville, remains the worst hit district. About 270 calls for aid remained to be answered there after 335 food drops on the weekend.  Hinchinbrook Shire councillor Andrew Lancini from Halifax, north of Ingham, said four helicopters were stretched keeping up with demand.  'I'm starting to really fear for some people, there's such a backlog of food drops to be done,' Cr Lancini said.  'People have just got to sit tight. There was 5.47m of water over the Halifax Bridge this morning so no one is going anywhere.'  A total of 2900 homes remain flood-effected, 41 residents are in emergency accommodation and 2300 food packs are being distributed.  Emergency Services Minister Neil Roberts said the damage bill would run into the hundreds of millions and the biggest worry was that rain would return.  Concerns about yesterday's high tides failed to materialise and the Bruce Highway should be open to the south this morning.  It was expected the Herbert River flood peak of 11.7m would be down to 8m by mid-morning.  More rain hit the Gulf of Carpentaria in the 24 hours to 9am yesterday, with 132mm at Camoowea.l  Lawn Hill recorded 101mm while on the east coast, 151mm fell north of Townsville.  Hot conditions returned to large parts of Queensland, with Archerfield in Brisbane's southwest recording 36 degrees although the bayside Brisbane Airport made only 31.  A late change today is expected to produce moderate to heavy falls in southern and southeast Queensland. Brisbane will be cooler tomorrow, with early rain.  Donations to flood victims can be made to the Premier's Disaster Relief Appeal Fund at any of the big banks, including the Commonwealth, Westpac, NAB, ANZ, Suncorp Metway and the Bank of Queensland.
