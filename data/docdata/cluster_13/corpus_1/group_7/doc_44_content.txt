'No Market' Yet For Landfill Bond According To GEDA Officials  Written by Josh Tyquiengco, Pacific News Center - Guam, Saipan, CNMI, Asia-Pacific  Guam  Guam- As a prelude to Monday's discussion of Bill 51, the Guam Economic Development Authority invited the Legislature, The Federal Receiver, and Government of Guam policy advisers to discuss various landfill financial matters laid out on the table.  Administrator Tony Blaz says his team and Bank of America advisers talked about how the market is still currently not available, and that pledging Section 30 money for Bill 51 makes sense, so it can secure bonds worth 160 million dollars for the new dump. Blaz also say the Private Activity Bond (PAB), which is another landfill financing option, is still a work in progress.  In the meantime, GEDA is awaiting RFI proposals from interested parties on how they will finance the cost and construction of the Dandan landfill. The deadline for proposals to be submitted is next Thursday, February 19.
