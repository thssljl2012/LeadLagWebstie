 A man has been sentenced to 75 years to life in prison for robbing a Foster City bank of $20,000 before leading police on a wild chase.  Antoine Drake, 44, ordered everyone to the ground at gunpoint and held up four tellers at the Citibank on Edgewater Boulevard on Dec. 20, 2007. He led police on a high-speed chase before crashing into several cars in a parking lot, authorities said.  Drake jumped out of his vehicle and fought with police, scratching an officer, before he was subdued.  Drake pleaded no contest in September to numerous felonies, including robbery, being a felon in possession of a gun, evading police, hit-and-run and resisting police, as well as enhancements for using a gun.   At his sentencing hearing on Tuesday, Drake pleaded for mercy from Judge Clifford Cretan of San Mateo County Superior Court. Drake spoke about his interest in boxing and told the judge that he looked better than boxing promoter Don King, said Steve Wagstaffe, chief deputy district attorney.  Unmoved, the judge denied a motion to strike Drake's two prior convictions - and a motion for probation - and sentenced him to prison.  E-mail Henry K. Lee at hlee@sfchronicle.com.
