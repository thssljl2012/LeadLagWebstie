 BATHURST Bargain Centre will help those whose lives have been devastated in the Victorian bushfires by donating all Thursdays shop takings to appeals set up by the Salvation Army and the Red Cross.  Central West Care director Stephanie Stocks is urging the community to go though their homes to find anything that could be sold on Thursday to raise money.  From what I have seen and read it is financial help that is most needed, Ms Stocks said yesterday.  Later we can look at sending clothes and other household goods.  She said the appeal day would run from 9am to 5pm. There will be a sausage sizzle and drinks available.  Central West Care will also take cash donations. These will be forwarded to the Red Cross and Salvation Army.  We ask people to bring in anything at all that can be sold and well bring out everything weve got.  Ms Stocks has also offered her services as a grief and loss counsellor.  I cant even imagine the fear those people felt, she said. It is such a tragedy for all who lost somebody.  The tragedy hit close to home for Ms Stocks yesterday as she tried for hours to contact her aunt and uncle Gail and Jim Tregaskis who live on a small property outside Acheron which is now in the path of the fire.  She finally contacted a family member who assured her the couple are fine. They have been evacuated and are working as volunteers at a nearby relief centre.  The 2009 Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund is receiving donations through the Red Cross.  Banks including National Australia Bank, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank and Westpac have donated $1 million each and Wesfarmers has pledged $500,000.  To make a donation to this appeal go to www.redcross.org.au.  A donation bucket had also been set up yesterday at Bathurst Bunnings, while the Associated Agents of the the Carcoar Stock Selling Complex had organised a drum to be left outside the canteen at this weeks sales today, tomorrow and Friday.
