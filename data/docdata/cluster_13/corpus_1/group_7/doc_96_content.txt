ATLANTA  A federal grand jury accuses 23-year-old Nikolay Nikolov and 29-year-old Yordan Kavaklov of using a 'skimming device' connected to Bank of America ATMs in metro Atlanta to record debit card numbers and videotape passwords people punched into the machines.  Prosecutors said Tuesday that the information was downloaded onto a computer and transferred to magnetic tapes on stolen gift cards, which then were used to withdraw money from ATMs.  The two were arrested Nov. 8 after reports they were making multiple withdrawals at ATMs in Marietta. Authorities say they confiscated $57,000, mostly in $20 bills.
