The Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald: Sydney's Commonwealth Bank says it will install gas-detection systems in its ATMs to combat a spate of robberies where gas has been used to blow up the machines. In a new robbery technique, thieves pump gas into an ATM money slot then detonate the machine from a distance. More than 24 ATM robberies have occurred in NSW, Queensland and Victoria in recent months, prompting a joint investigation into the crime spree. To combat the explosive robberies, the Commonwealth Bank has announced plans to install gas-detection systems in its ATMs, which would be linked to onsite and back-to-base alarms.
