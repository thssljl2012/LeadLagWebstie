It's better to give than to receive.  Tuesday, an anonymous donor took that premise to heart and donated $1 million to the victims of the fire that devastated the Burncliff Manor apartment complex Monday, Dec. 22, in Burnsville.  Friday, Dec. 26, another donor added $50,000 to the pot to help the 64 displaced families. The donations have been given to Chaska-based Goodman Group, which manages Burncliff Manor Apartments, to distribute by apartment.  The group had already established a $100,000 fund at US Bank to help the 190 displaced residents. The fire ravaged the 64-unit building, but did not damage the other apartment building.  Residents should contact the Group office, 1107 Hazeltine Blvd. in Chaska, with questions about the fire recovery donations.
