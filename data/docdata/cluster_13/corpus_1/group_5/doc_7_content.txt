CHICAGO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Illinois is preparing to sell $1.4 billion of cash-flow notes on Thursday, just two days after the governor was hit with corruption charges by U.S. prosecutors. But the municipal market does not appear to be factoring in Gov. Rod Blagojevich's legal woes as dealers weigh whether to bid on the notes. 'Some questions are being asked, but I don't think it's going to be an issue. It really has no impact on (the state's) fiscal situation,' a Wall Street trader said on Wednesday. 'That's not what we are focusing on,' said a Chicago-based trader, adding that there appeared to be strong interest in the market for bidding on the notes. Bidding for the general obligation certificates is scheduled for noon ET. Illinois Budget Director Ginger Ostro issued a notice ahead of the deal addressing federal charges brought against Blagojevich and his chief of staff John Harris on Tuesday. 'None of the allegations have any relationship to or impact on the state of Illinois' cash position, the need for short-term financing or the ability of the state to repay the short-term financing,' the notice said. As for potential bidders on the notes, it was unclear whether the governor still intended to stop doing business with Bank of America after the bank made an offer on Tuesday to make a loan to a Chicago window and door business so it could pay workers to end a several days-long sit-in. Blagojevich made the threat against the bank after visiting with the workers a day before he was arrested by federal agents. 'It'd be premature to say anything, as negotiations are ongoing,' said a Blagojevich spokeswoman in an e-mail. Illinois is pursuing the borrowing to help pay off a growing backlog of bills.
