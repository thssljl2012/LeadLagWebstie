THE State Government has put a $100,000 reward on the heads of the 'bamraiders' blowing up ATMs around Sydney.  The reward, to be announced by Police Minister Tony Kelly today, comes on the back of a $50,000 reward offered by the Australian Bankers Association yesterday.   ATM bandits struck again early this morning, blowing up a machine in Sydney's south-west.  At about 2am, the St George ATM located at the Ruse Village shopping centre on Junction Road, was blown apart.   Mr Kelly said he hoped the government's reward, for the arrest and conviction of the raiders, helped loosen some tongues in the criminal world. 'Given the frequency of these attacks, the number of people suspected of involvement and the amount of money stolen, police believe that there are people in the community with vital information about these crimminals,'' he said. 'Although the success rate in getting money from ATMs using this method is low, there is a significant risk for injury to innocent members of the community. 'The explosions have also caused significant property damage to nearby and surrounding premises.''   Anyone with information should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.   Today's bamraiders caused significant structural damage to the teller machine, as well as damaging a Commonwealth Bank ATM right next to it.   In pictures: Bam buffoons' trails of damage  Police believe the would-be thieves fled the scene empty handed, failing to get the cash draw.   Nearby residents woke to a loud bang and one said he saw a red truck with broken tail lights leaving the scene shortly after the explosion.   The ATM's were located out the front of the Ruse Village Newsagency and owner Michael Faraj said there appeared to be extensive damage to his store as well.   Local detectives and investigators from Strike Force Piccadilly II are investigating the matter and asking any witnesses to come forward.  What is this?
