former Wachovia bank officer has been sentenced to three years in federal prison for his role in a money-laundering scheme tied to Medicare fraud.   Javier Ortiz Jr., 36, of Miami used his position as an assistant vice president at the bank to open business checking accounts in the names of straw owners for medical companies operated by Angel Castillo Jr., prosecutors charged. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison for orchestrating a $48 million Medicare and money-laundering scheme.   Castillo paid Ortiz lump sums for his help in lifting computer holds from Medicare checks issued to Castillo and his business partners. They would sometimes wait in Ortiz's office at the West Gables Financial Center for cash withdrawals. Ortiz was accused of laundering more than $400,000 in fraud proceeds since 2005.   Ortiz pleaded guilty in October before U.S. District Court Judge Adalberto Jordan after being charged by criminal information the month before.   Two bankers are among eight defendants indicted in an alleged $1 million fraud scheme involving two home equity loans.   Fraudulent applications seeking $500,000 each went to Jorge Arrieta, a personal banker at Bank of America, and Sebastian Kishinevsky, a financial specialist at Wachovia, who processed them for a fee, federal prosecutors charged last week.   Both applications listed the mother-in-law of co-defendant Bienvenido "Benny" Benach Jr. as the borrower and pledged her home as collateral, but she was unaware her name and Social Security number had been used, the indictment said.   The defendants allegedly split loan proceeds totaling $800,000.
