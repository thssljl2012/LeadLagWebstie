This wrought iron railing adorned an upstairs balcony on Walnut Street of the historic bank building recently demolished to make way for a new US Bank building.  The Red Bluff Rotary Foundation s Cone &amp;amp; Kimball Plaza project was selected for funding in the amount of $23,100 from The McConnell Fund of the Shasta Regional Community Foundation.  This is an enormous boost to finalization of the project and the funds are dedicated to the landscaped water feature element of the original design.  'The proposed design by Patrick Sullivan incorporates many features of existing elements and will blend nicely adding the cool sound of water on hot Red Bluff days,' said committee member Nancy Robison. 'In addition, we ve been able to use the wrought iron balcony railing from the old US Bank building. Our thanks to Tom Eubanks for preserving this piece of Red Bluff history and donating it to the project.'  Funds generated by the $40,000 in 40 Days campaign will be used to pay for the brick trim on the clock tower columns and to construct a plaza sign that will include donor plaques.  'Less than a week to go and we thank those that have responded, said Ev McDonough Red Bluff Rotary president.  However, the Foundation is at 16 percent of the goal, which is disappointing . The sign element of the project will not be constructed until funds are available, so we will just have to continue our fundraising efforts for as long as it takes.'  All donations can be sent to Red Bluff Rotary Foundation, a 501c-3 non profit corporation and donations are tax deductible to the extent allowed by IRS.
