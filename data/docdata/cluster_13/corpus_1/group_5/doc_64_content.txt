NORTON  Eleven companies and two municipalities have agreed to continue cleanup at the Shpack Landfill Superfund site in the towns of Norton and Attleboro and to pay up to $2.9 million to the federal government.  Under the agreement announced by the Justice Department and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Tuesday, the following defendants have signed an agreement: the City of Attleboro; Avnet Inc.; Bank of America; BASF Catalysts LLC; Chevron Environmental Management Company; ConocoPhillips Co.; Handy &amp;amp; Harman; International Paper Co.; KIK Custom Products, Inc.; Town of Norton; Swank Inc.; Teknor Apex Co.; Texas Instruments Inc.; and Waste Management of Massachusetts Inc.  The defendants will perform the remainder of the site-wide cleanup of chemical wastes and other contaminants at a cost $29 million. In addition to performing cleanup work, the defendants will pay up to $2.9 million for EPAs costs.  The site is contaminated with chemical and radioactive wastes as a result of a landfill at the site.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers currently is cleaning up the radioactive contamination, which is expected to be completed during the fall of 2010. Once the radioactive soil cleanup is completed by the Army Corps, the defendants will excavate the remaining contaminated soils.  The Shpack Landfill is a 9.4 acre site located in Norton and Attleboro. A portion of the site operated as a town dump from 1946 to 1965. The Shpack portion of the site received waste from 1946 to 1975.
