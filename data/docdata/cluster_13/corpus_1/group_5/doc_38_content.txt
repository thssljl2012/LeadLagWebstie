Vancouver's Olympic athletes' village under construction  Photograph by : Ian Lindsay  With the economy still heading into a recession and many Olympic partners in financial trouble, organizers of the Vancouver 2010 Olympics have revised their operating budget just as they are about to enter their major spending period.  Today, Vancouver Organizing Committee management will present a revised and more conservative budget to its 20-member board of directors. But already, Vanoc has started to pare back even further on a $1.63-billion operating budget that, compared to those of other Olympics, is already viewed as bare-bones.  Vanoc wont release details of the revised budget until after the meeting. But CEO John Furlong has said in recent weeks that the review, which started last spring as a routine action, took on added importance when the economy went soft in September and markets began to lose ground.  Vanoc said Monday that both Furlong and executive vice-president Dave Cobb were out of town and unavailable for interviews. However, they provided a statement from Furlong in which he said a budget review undertaken earlier this year had to be revised in light of the world economic crisis.  Just as we were completing the exercise, the worlds economy took an unprecedented negative turn and Vanocs management team went back to review the budget once again with the goal of finding creative, additional ways to grow the contingency to protect against any unforeseen challenges in the next year, he said.  Vanoc allocated $100 million as contingency in its operating budget. But Furlong hinted that may not be enough.  While we remain confident and remain in a positive financial position despite the downturn in the economy, we know we will need to overcome challenges at some point so were working hard to bank as much contingency as possible to be ready for any eventualities.  Furlong told other media last week that Vanoc had already cut some areas, including travel. He chopped by two-thirds the number of people who were to attend a debriefing of the 2008 Summer Games at a conference last week in London.  This board meeting is also the first time Vanoc directors will meet with Vancouvers new mayor, Gregor Robertson. There has been no indication whether Robertson intends to replace the citys two directors on the board, businessman Jeff Mooney and city manager Judy Rogers, with choices of his own. He is also likely to discuss issues around the $100-million loan guarantee the city gave to the financial backers of the construction company building the Athletes Village on False Creek.  But it is Vanocs financial state that will most preoccupy the board.  The downturn in the economy has hit every one of Vanocs sponsors, but none more so than General Motors Canada, which is providing 4,500 vehicles. It has applied to Ottawa for a bailout loan, and its parent company, General Motors, told the U.S. Congress that it would run out of cash within a month if it didnt get government-backed loan guarantees.  Just about every publicly listed sponsor of the Vancouver Olympics has seen its share prices slashed deeply.  The recession is certain to take the bloom off the Olympic rose. Tourism Vancouver president Rick Antonson said Monday many tourism destination cities around the world are seeing a decline in visitors and he expects Vancouver wont escape.  However, the Olympics and Vancouvers new waterfront convention centre will help soften the impact, he said.  The Olympics have very long coattails and were fortunate to be riding on them, he said. There are many cities that will be wishing that they could have the Olympics too. For us the Olympics are the glow in the dark.  As tough as the economy has turned, Cobb doesnt believe any of his Olympic corporate partners will bail out of their commitments. In an interview in October, he told The Vancouver Sun he was confident that Vanoc would hit its goal of raising $760 million in corporate sponsorships. It remains about $12 million short but is still working on several deals.  Furlong felt it necessary to reinforce that view again this week.  We have great confidence in our sponsors. And while many companies are managing their way through challenges, all sponsor payments are up to date and we continue to talk to interested companies about sponsorship opportunities, he said.  Sponsors and partners are telling us that the Olympic and Paralympic Games represent a bright light and opportunity during these challenging times. They see their partnership with the Games and their ability to leverage the Games to meet their business objectives as more important than ever before.  Cobb also believes the downturn could be a silver lining for Vanoc, which is set to spend about $1 billion between now and 2010 to procure goods and services needed at Games time. Companies hungry for business will be more likely to sharpen their pencils.  This is also a telling week in other financial areas. Vanoc is about to get a major boost to its bank accounts. On Wednesday, the first round of ticket sales concludes. Vanoc says demand so far has been strong enough to force tickets to 120 of 170 events to be allocated on the basis of lotteries.  Overall, it has budgeted $231 million in ticket sales and this week has already begun to debit customers Visa credit cards. A second round of ticket sales begins later this week.
