Three New Brunswick men charged in a bank robbery spree last year that culminated in the death of an FBI agent have been found guilty on most counts and face lengthy prison sentences.  Wilfredo Berrios, 30, Efrain Lynn, 22, and Francisco Herrera-Genao, 23, were convicted Wednesday in federal court in Trenton on multiple bank robbery, conspiracy and weapons counts.  Authorities said the trio, along with a fourth man who previously pleaded guilty, hit four banks in central New Jersey before they were apprehended outside a PNC Bank in Readington. In that robbery, FBI Agent Barry Lee Bush was mistakenly shot and killed by a fellow agent.  The defendants weren't charged with Bush's death, but it can be considered at sentencing.  In addition to the conspiracy convictions for each defendant, Herrera-Genao was convicted on four counts of bank robbery, one count of attempted bank robbery and five weapons counts.  Berrios was convicted on three counts of bank robbery, one count of attempted robbery and four weapons counts, and Lynn was found guilty on two counts of bank robbery and two weapons counts.  Each of the bank robbery counts carries a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison. The weapons counts carry mandatory consecutive prison terms ranging from five to 25 years, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.  The robberies occurred at Commerce and Bank of America branches in Piscataway, East Brunswick, Ocean Township and South Brunswick in February and March 2007. The group reaped about $87,000 from the heists.
