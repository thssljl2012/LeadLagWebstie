Pakistan Wapda Hydro Electric Central Labour Union (CBA) president Abdul Latif Nizamani said this while addressing a meeting of meter readers and other Hesco employees at Labour Hall here on Friday.  He said that the post had been upgraded due to the efforts of the union.  Continuous struggle was the hallmark of a trade union he said, adding that organisations with a strong leadership and sincere workers were apt to cross any hurdles, whatsoever.  Workers were the vanguard of a trade union and failure on the part of leadership and workers had seen many a private and government organisations falling apart, said Nizamani.  Workers since long had been exploited by pocket unions and repressive measure adopted by the bureaucracy through inaction of black laws, he said.  Workers were living in abject poverty at many places because of the absence of strong trade unions. He congratulated meter readers on their upgradation.
