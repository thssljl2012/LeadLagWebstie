The victim had just parked at the Wal-Mart in Lake Worth, and was walking toward the store, when she was approached by two women.  Police say the pair distracted the woman and eventually convinced her to give them thousands of dollars.  Monday afternoon the victim, who didn't want to be identified, said she was still 'kind of shaking' from the event last week.  'I could have gotten killed, so in order to survive I have to listen to them, what they are going to tell me,' the 46-year-old explained.  The crooks struck up a conversation with the victim, even complimenting her on her hair. One of the perpetrators then pulled out a wallet and said she had found it in the store parking lot. She told the victim there were $1000 bills inside and the only way to 'break' the bills was for the victim to get money out of her bank account.  The victim said she thought one woman probably had a gun or a knife. 'The whole time her hand is in the purse,' she said.  According to the victim, the pair took her to another Wal-Mart in Westworth Village. One of the suspects claimed she worked at the store and might be able to get change for the bills there.  Nothing happened at the Westworth Village location and the women then allegedly convinced the victim to go to her bank and withdraw $6,000.  After withdrawing the money, the woman gave it to the crooks. They then took her back to the Wal-Mart in Lake Worth, dropped her off and drove away.  The entire incident has the victim's husband, Cary Snyder, furious.  'If it was a man, and I could get my hands on him, I'd hurt him,' he said.  Snyder admits his wife should have followed her instincts. 'There is some personal blame but this part here I want to get past that and get the people who did this.'  Westworth Village police are looking for two African American women. One suspect weighs around 175 pounds, stands 6 feet tall, and is missing all of her front upper teeth.  The car the crooks were driving is described as either a 1980s or early 1990s model, light tan, 4-door sedan, with a cracked front windshield and damaged front bumper.  Investigators say if you are approached by someone asking about found property you should call police immediately.  The U.S. Treasury stopped producing $1000 bills in 1969. Existing bills are still legal tender, but they are extremely rare.  ( MMVIII, CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.)
