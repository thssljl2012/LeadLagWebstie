The Princeton Regional Chamber of Commerce has selected Peter M. Crowley as its new president and chief executive officer. Mr. Crowley, a Princeton-area resident for more than 25 years, was most recently president and CEO and a founding investor in The Bank of Princeton, a state chartered community bank headquartered in Princeton.

PRCC Vice President Adam Perle had been acting president in the interim.  Peter is a highly successful, innovative and collaborative leader who we are confident will ensure the chambers continued growth and success, stated Lawrence Krampf, PRCC chairman of the board and leader of the search committee that selected Mr. Crowley. Mr. Krampf is CEO of Princeton Communications Group.  I am thrilled to become a part of the Princeton Regional Chamber of Commerce, and I look forward to working with the board of directors and chamber members as we continue to expand our chamber and support the needs of our business community, stated Mr. Crowley in a release.  Mr. Crowleys career in the banking industry has included managing retail and private bank offices for institutions such as Bank of America, Citibank and PNC Bank. He was a member of the board of directors of The Bank of Princeton; served as a director of Midlantic Banks Compass Mutual Funds; and served as an advisory board member of Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York.
