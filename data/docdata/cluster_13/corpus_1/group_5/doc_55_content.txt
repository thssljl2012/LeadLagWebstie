JUPITER, Fla. -- Customers in need of some fast cash won't be able to get their money from the ATM at one Palm Beach County bank.  Police say the entire ATM machine was stolen from a Bank of America in Jupiter early Tuesday morning. Investigators believe the thieves stole a front end loader from a nearby construction site and used that to rip the ATM machine out of the concrete wall. The ATM was then loaded into another car, which fled the scene.  No further information has been released.  It's not clear how much money, if any, was taken in the smash-and-grab burglary.
