 KELLY BURKE CONSUMER AFFAIRS REPORTER  CONSTRUCTION on more than 100 homes halted yesterday as the economic slump claimed another home-building scalp.  An administrator was called into the Parramatta head office of the project home building company Wincrest Homes, with the prospect of the 22-year-old family-owned operation being placed in receivership today.  Neither company's co-founder and chief executive, Michael Caruana, nor the financial controller, Gerard Caruana, were taking the Herald's calls yesterday.  But the administrator, Bruce Gleeson, confirmed Wincrest owed $6 million to its secured creditor, St George Bank, $4 million to tradespeople and contractors and a further $2 million to related parties.  In addition to its 100 homes under construction, Wincrest is believed to have taken deposits from a further 20 customers, who hold contracts for homes scheduled to be built in coming months. It is also believed the company had taken on a number of projects from other builders over the past year, which have worsened the company's financial position and prompted its recent decision to pull out of a secondary market in Victoria.  The pending collapse appears to be on a smaller scale than that of Beechwood Homes, which floundered last May, owing $11 million to BankWest and leaving 350 customers with either signed contracts or partly built homes. The resumption of construction was stalled for more than three months while receivers struggled to sell the three separate Beechwood entities.  The State Government and the home building warranty insurer, Vero, also came under intense criticism over the delays.  Last night, the Minister for Fair Trading, Virginia Judge, said her office had been advised that Wincrest had been placed in voluntary administration, and officers from her department were hoping to meet with Mr Gleeson as soon as possible. 'This is a very distressing time for the home owners involved,' she said.
