BRI Leasing is being led by   William Purcell  When asked how he felt about undertaking BRI Leasing Purcell responded, 'I'm very excited to be part of a growing, dynamic company such as Bio-Reaction. I've had an interest in the 'Clean-Tech' space for some time, and see a great opportunity to assist our customers with customized finance solutions to improve their pollution control needs. It's a great thing to be able to participate in business opportunities that are also socially responsible.' Given the current economic environment BRI Leasing could not have come at a better time when businesses prepare to compete and grow in a global market but need financing options for their capital budget funding needs. 'Bill Purcell brings a high level of experience to this position and this company which allows Bio-Reaction to continue to be the leading provider of low energy using, low green house gas emitting air pollution control technology in the world. Bill is a high quality individual and we are excited to have him lead this effort,' said Karl Mundorff  About Bio-Reaction Industries Bio-Reaction Industries, LLC (BRI) pioneered a new generation of low energy, environmentally friendly air pollution control systems that utilize microbes to digest industrial pollutants and odors.
