A string of armed robberies in Salinas continued Wednesday night when three men held up the Save Mart supermarket store on North Davis Road, police said. It marked the fifth time a Salinas grocery store has been held up in the past month.  In Wednesday's heist, three men entered the Save Mart about 6:40 p.m. carrying what was described as an Uzi-style weapon and ordered the customers and employees to the floor, police said.  The men, wearing bandanas over their faces, took an undisclosed amount of cash from the supermarket and the Bank of America inside, police said.  It is believed the men fled in a white pickup truck toward Davis Road, according to police.  Since Dec. 29, there have been at least eight armed robberies in the city.'There are no connections,' said Sgt. Chris Lane. 'They are similar, but we have nothing concrete to say they are related. They just seem to be.'Lane said the robberies are likely to continue unless arrests are made.  Since this string of armed robberies, some residents say they only shop during the day.'Why put ourselves in harm's way?' said Jan Santee, 67, of Salinas. 'We don't shop at night. It just seems to be more sensible.'Last weekend, the Nob Hill store on South Main Street, which has been robbed twice at gunpoint since Dec. 26, agreed to pay the Police Department for an officer to patrol the store.  The supermarket is paying for an officer's overtime salary plus a 12 percent processing fee, said Sgt. Terry Gerhardstein, who is in charge of special operations.'High (police) visibility is a deterrent to crime,' Gerhardstein said.Now, the store has a police officer patrolling the parking lot by car.  Two other businesses, Northridge Mall and Maya Cinema, also pay for extra police patrol, he said.
