FARMERS who were hit hard by the flooding in the Wainibuka area are surviving on rotten cassava and dalo following the devastation of their root crops and vegetables worth $1.6million.  And they have called on the interim Government to seriously engage in rehabilitating them to avoid hunger and starvation.  According to the area field officer Wainibuka, Isaia Bobo, 630 families now relied on assistance for their daily survival.  'From what I've seen, these affected families will finish off their supply within two weeks. They don't have any other option but to rely on some kind of assistance to survive,' said Mr Bobo.  He said the flood was the worst to hit the area.  'This flood is totally different because not only did it flood the plantation for a day or two, we had to wait for four days before it finally receded,' said Mr Bobo.  He said that about 32 hectares of dalo, 42 hectares of cassava, 28 hectares of banana and 16 hectares of vegetables were washed away into the Wainibuka River.  'Many people will start to look for food elsewhere within the next two weeks. Those who have the money can buy from the shops but most will rely on government assistance and other donors to eventually feed them,' said Mr Bobo.  He called on the Government to come up with a rehabilitation plan to rebuild their lives.  'The farmers need kumala plants, and vegetable seedlings because it will only take them three months to harvest,' he added.  Meanwhile, the affected villagers received a timely donation from the ANZ Bank, which delivered food to all the villages in Wainibuka over the weekend. This included rice, sugar, flour, tinned meat and tinned fish and toilet paper.  Interim Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama also visited the area last week to get first-hand information about the flood. He was also accompanied by military officers who also supplied food to the villagers.
