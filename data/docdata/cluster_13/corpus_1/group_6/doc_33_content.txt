Because he violated probation, another 30 months was added to Richelieu's 130-month sentence for the robberies. 'I think you have the ability to always convince yourself that there are reasons to commit a crime,' U.S. District Judge George Singal told Richelieu as he handed down the sentence in Portland. 'Those reasons stop today.' The first bank robbed by Richelieu was the Bank of America branch at 446 Forest Ave. in Portland on Nov. 9, 2006.  A little less than a month later, Richelieu was arrested by Connecticut State Police as he walked out of a Putnam Savings Bank branch in Griswold, Conn., with a bag containing $11,000.  Richelieu admitted to being armed with a handgun during three of the robberies.  Prosecutors said Richelieu spent some of the stolen money to pay off debts, and he gambled some at Foxwoods casino in southeastern Connecticut.  Before his arrest, Richelieu was employed at a flooring company, and he developed his own construction company and built three houses.  His defense lawyer, David Beneman, said it was the decision to go into business on his own that ultimately led Richelieu into trouble.  First of all, Richelieu didn't have permission from his probation officer to start such a venture, Beneman said.  Then when Richelieu had trouble selling the houses, he panicked. 'Patrick made very poor judgments,' Beneman said. 'The choice here was, 'I need the money, banks have the money, I'll rob the banks.'' At Thursday's hearing, Richelieu apologized to his family, friends and the court. 'I am deeply remorseful and ashamed of my conduct,' he said. He also mentioned the bank employees who experienced the trauma of the robberies. 'I never had any intentions of harming anyone and I offer my apologies to each of them,' Richelieu said.
