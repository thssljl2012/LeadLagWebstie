The sun is finally shining in Fiji after days of heavy rain and wild winds.  The country's military is now fully deployed helping to clear roads, cut down trees and remove debris.  The areas worst affected by flooding are Sigatoka, Nadi, Ba and Rakiraki.  Disaster management officer Patiliai Dobui says 11,000 people whose homes have been flooded are still in evacuation centres.  He says they are being advised to wait until the Ministry of Health makes sure their properties are safe to return to.  Dobui says 11 people have been confirmed dead.  On Friday New Zealand offered a further $500,000 to help relief efforts. Foreign Minister Murray McCully said $300,000 would go towards supplying items identified by Fiji's Disaster Management Committee as being urgently needed, including water tanks and containers, water purification tablets, and rehydration salts.  The items would be provided by international agencies.  McCully said up to $200,000 more would be available for organisations 'with an established presence in affected areas', and New Zealand would consider further requests for assistance as more detailed assessments came in from Fiji.
