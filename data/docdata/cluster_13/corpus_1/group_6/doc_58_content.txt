Elk Grove police arrested a 20-year-old Sacramento man for allegedly robbing a bank Tuesday.  Donnell Flaughter was arrested on suspicion of robbery, Elk Grove police Officer Christopher Trim said. A search of Flaughter's home in the 6500 block of Sunnyfield Way found evidence linking him to the robbery, Trim said.  Trim said police had detained two men. Surveillance photos from the bank were obtained and one of the men matched the photos even though his clothes had changed.  An unarmed man robbed the Bank of America inside the Save Mart at 7707 Laguna Boulevard about 12:09 p.m., Trim said.  The man passed the bank teller a note demanding cash. He got away with cash, Trim said.  Officers called off the search for the robber around 2 p.m. The search had been centered on the neighborhoods in the North Laguna Creek area, including the areas near Starburst Way and Sunnyfield Way.
