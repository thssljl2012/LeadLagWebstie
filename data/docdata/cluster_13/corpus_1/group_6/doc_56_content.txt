(Star Tribune - McClatchy-Tribune Information Services via COMTEX) --  A man who held up a Brooklyn Center bank Tuesday afternoon didn't get far as police tracked him down minutes after the robbery.  But the FBI is still searching for two other robbers: a man who robbed a St. Paul bank on Tuesday and fled through the skyway, as well as a brazen crook who has been on bank robbery spree in the east metro.  Authorities arrested Corey Jermaine Scott, 30, of Minneapolis, in connection with a stick-up at the TCF Bank on County Road 10 in Brooklyn Center. In that heist, Scott allegedly robbed the bank at gunpoint, then fled in a vehicle. A description was broadcast to surrounding law enforcement agencies when he failed to stop for police, said FBI Special Agent E.K. Wilson.  Squads from Brooklyn Center, Brooklyn Park and the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office stopped Scott and found cash and a black and silver handgun in his vehicle. He also was wearing clothing that matched the description of that worn by the robber, Wilson said.  Scott has been charged with the heist, according to a criminal complaint filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in St. Paul. A detention hearing is scheduled for Friday, Wilson said.  The FBI is still looking for the man who robbed a TCF Bank on the skyway level at 444 Cedar Street in St. Paul on Tuesday. The robber was carrying a small, green, gift-type bag and possibly a folding cane. He is described as a white man believed to be in his mid-30s to mid-40s. He is about 5 feet 7 or 8 inches tall, 170 pounds and has a medium build and scruffy appearance. He was wearing a tan-colored bomber hat with ear flaps, a gray quarter-zip fleece top and light-colored pants or jeans.  The FBI is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of a bandit believed to be responsible for robbing six east metro banks over the past few months. In all cases, the masked robber, described as a black man, about 5 feet 10 inches tall and in his 20s or early 30s, has hit in the early morning, Wilson said.  The most recent holdup was Dec. 30 when the suspect approached tellers reporting for work just before 7 a.m. at the Wells Fargo Bank on the 1800 block of Grand Avenue in St. Paul. He flashed a black handgun and ordered the tellers inside.  The same man is believed to be behind heists or attempted heists at the Cherokee State Bank at 985 Grand Av., St. Paul, on Aug. 27 and Nov. 26; the U.S. Bank at 1950 Burns Av., St. Paul, on Oct. 26; the U.S. Bank branch at 711 Cleveland Av. S., St. Paul, on Nov. 14, and the Northern American Banking Co. at 9260 Hudson Road in Woodbury on Dec. 2. All happened in the early morning hours.  Anyone with information can call the FBI tip line at 612-376-3200.  To see more of the Star Tribune, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to  http://www.startribune.com/.
