GREENSBURG, Pa. -- A legendary hotel in Westmoreland County announced it will close its doors on Sunday.  The historic Mountain View Inn in Greensburg has hosted some of the world's biggest celebrities, but now business is bad.  Channel 4 Action News' Jennifer Miele reported the inn survived the depression, World War II and even two fires. But owners Vance and Vicki Booher said this time business is just too slow.  Built in the 1920s, the inn was sold to the Booher family in 1940. Their luxurious rooms have housed the Dalai Lama, Presidents Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy, Tiger Woods and Harrison Ford.  Mountain View is also on the national historic preservation list.  But preserving the business is not an option without an influx of emergency credit from First Commonwealth Bank.  The Boohers have put up much of their own money to try to keep the doors open, but the economy is just too bad.  The owners are working to rebook guests and banquets at other area venues. Even though the staff there knows they may not be paid in these last few days, all of them have decided to work anyway in the hopes something with change.     2009 by ThePittsburghChannel.
