Authorities say today that DNA helped them identify one of two men involved in a 2008 home invasion in the Town of Verona.  The suspect was caught because he left the plastic tip of a cigar at the scene, the Dane County Sheriff's Office said.  The State Crime Laboratory confirmed a DNA test that links Jarrell A. Murray, 23, to the March 9, 2008 home invasion, the sheriff's department said.  Intruders broke in that afternoon when a woman and her children were napping in their house. The intruders were approaching the bedroom door of one of the children but fled when they realized the woman was awake.  Murray was in the Dane County Jail awaiting federal charges in connection with a string of bank robberies, including the U.S. Bank in the Town of Blooming Grove, the sheriff's department said. The state crime lab investigating the bank robberies discovered the match.  Authorities are still looking for a second man they believe was involved in the home invasion.  Anyone with information about the home invasion can call Dane County's crime tip line at (608) 284-6900.
