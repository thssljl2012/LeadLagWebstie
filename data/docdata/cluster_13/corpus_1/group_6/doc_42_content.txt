Michael Bullerdick, a regional president at First Community Bank of America, left the company. Ronald Monck was promoted to fill the job.  The bank announced the departure of Bullerdick, who was president of its Charlotte County region, on Wednesday, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission said.

Prior to joining First Community Bank, Bullerdick was employed with SunTrust Bank (NYSE: STI) for nine years.  Bullerdick also serves on the board of governors of the Tampa Bay Area Regional Transportation Authority.  Monck was promoted to the Charlotte County regional presidents post, effective Wednesday, the filing said. He has been in banking since 1972. In Florida, he was employed by the former Barnett Bank from 1983 to 1996. Prior to his employment by First Community Bank in January 2008, Monck served as senior vice president of Charlotte State Bank.
