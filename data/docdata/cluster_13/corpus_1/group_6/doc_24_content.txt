A teenager accused of carrying out an Alameda bank robbery has been linked to similar holdups in Castro Valley, Fairfield and Antioch, according to investigators.  Along with admitting to the robbery earlier this month at the Washington Mutual Bank on Marina Village Parkway, the 17-year-old Oakland resident admitted to taking part in other robberies when Alameda detectives questioned him following his arrest in connection with the Castro Valley robbery, police said.  The teenager was arrested Jan. 16.   Investigators did not disclose his name because he is a minor.   Alameda police detective Sgt. Don Owyang said Thursday that the teen who faces multiple felony charges may be tried as an adult as prosecutors go forward with the case.  During the Alameda robbery on Jan. 8, the suspect handed an employee a note demanding money and was last seen climbing into a vehicle that was parked outside.  The teenager was arrested shortly after a similar holdup at a Citibank branch in Castro Valley, where a dye-pack hidden among the stolen cash exploded as he was fleeing the scene, police said.  Deputies with the Alameda County Sheriff's Office pursued the suspect's getaway vehicle into San Leandro, where they arrested the teenager and two men at 150th Avenue and Foothill Boulevard on suspicion of carrying out the robbery.  The adults were identified as brothers Anthony 'Tony' Moore, 20, and 18-year-old Jovonnie Moore. Like the teenager, the men live in Oakland and face robbery and other charges.   After the teen was arrested, investigators linked him with the Alameda holdup based on his description and on the similar way that the Alameda and Castro Valley robberies were carried out.  Owyang and Alameda police Detective Hank Morton interviewed the teenager the same day he was arrested, when they said he also admitted responsibility.
