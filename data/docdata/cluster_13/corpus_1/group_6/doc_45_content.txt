GRAND RAPIDS -- Since October, Bank of America has lost $520,000 to a fraud scheme in which scammers used customers' accounts and personal information to withdraw cash.   Four suspects, all California residents, were in U.S. District Court on Thursday, accused of using bogus identification during a two-day crime spree in Grand Rapids and Holland that netted $17,000.   Secret Service Special Agent Shawn Smith testified that the four -- Kamillah Brown, Alonzo Holloway, Shawncy McGowan and Kirk Usher -- were arrested after a suspicious Bank of America worker in Wyoming called police. Police stopped their rental car Jan. 9. 'The teller wasn't satisfied with the piece of identification that was offered,' he testified. Bank of America investigators had sent an alert to workers about the fraud.   Smith testified authorities searched the rental vehicle and later the suspects' rooms at a Comfort Inn, where police found the cash, mostly $100 bills, hidden in pajamas in a suitcase. Police also found counterfeit identification. 'They were very good, very high quality sets of California drivers' licenses and credit cards,' Smith said. Investigators determined the suspects, with little reported income, took numerous flights across the country. Holloway's 38 flights were the most, Smith said.   He said the suspects have extensive criminal records. All waived their rights to detention hearings, but Magistrate Judge Joseph Scoville said none would be released because of their risk of fleeing.   The case is to be presented to a grand jury Feb. 11. If indicted, the defendants will be arraigned two days later.   Thursday's hearing was for only Holloway and McGowan. Before it began, Brown and Usher waived their rights to preliminary hearings.
