Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and Department of Consumer Protection Commissioner Jerry Farrell says about 30,000 people in Connecticut were affected.   Blumenthal says Bank of America, which purchased Countrywide last year, has agreed to reimburse customers for the cost of freezing their credit to prevent identification fraud.   The $350,000 paid to the state will go into its general fund.   Federal officials last year charged a former Countrywide analyst and another man in an alleged scam to sell data from as many as 2 million customers of the mortgage lender.Advertisement
