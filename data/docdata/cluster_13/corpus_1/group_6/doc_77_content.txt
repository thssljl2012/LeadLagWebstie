We will be protesting in the seven major banks that have received bailouts in excess of $150 billion. No one, including government, knows what they're doing with the money.  Our protest will begin at 11:30am in the lobby of the Bank of America Building at 555 California Street. We are scheduling meetings with senior management from the B of A, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, US Bancorp, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. At approximately 1:00pm we will march from our last bank meeting to the San Francisco Federal Reserve to meet with the senior management at the Federal Reserve Bank.  On Martin Luther King's actual birth date, our message is also intended for the new Obama administration and Congress as it begins drawing up new legislation. Our issues include preventing foreclosures, major loan modifications and support for small businesses under the Obama economic stimulus plan, excessive executive compensation, full transparency, and philanthropy to the underserved.  This could be the most fascinating, and certainly most productive 'walking tour' of San Francisco for the year 2009. 'Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.
