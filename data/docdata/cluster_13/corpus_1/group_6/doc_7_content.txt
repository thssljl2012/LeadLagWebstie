MADISON, Wis. -- The Dane County Sheriff's Department said Thursday that a rare DNA match has helped them identify one of the men involved in a town of Verona home invasion in March.  Elise Schaffer, public information officer for the Dane County Sheriff's Department, said the state Crime Lab confirmed the results of a DNA test that links Jarrell A. Murray, 23, to the home invasion case on Cross Country Road that occurred on March 9, 2008.  Murray is currently in the Dane County Jail. Schaffer said he is awaiting federal charges in connection with a string of bank robberies, including the US Bank in the town of Blooming Grove.  Schaffer said that in the March home invasion, a woman and her children were napping in their home, and when the woman awoke at approximately 2 p.m., she found a man approaching her daughter's bedroom door.  Authorities said once the men realized someone was home, they fled. Schaffer said detectives with the Dane County Sheriff's Office submitted DNA evidence to the state Crime Lab, and while also investigating the string of bank robberies, the DNA match was made.  Schaffer said the home invasion case remains open with the Dane County Sheriff's Office, because investigators believe a second man was involved, and he has yet to be identified.  Anyone with information about the incident is encouraged to call the Dane County tip line at 608-284-6900.
