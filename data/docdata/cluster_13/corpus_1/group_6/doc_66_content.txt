Developer Lear Management had been given planning permission for a B&amp;Q, a hotel and a casino as part of the 60 million scheme for derelict land off Waterloo Road in   and work was due to start within months. The development was expected to create 600 . The plans, which were expected to include a Premier Inn and a B&amp;Q superstore, also involved the extension of the  ring road. But now National Australia Bank has taken control of the plot because it says Lear Management has not been repaying interest on loans made to fund the project.  No insolvency proceedings have been taken against Lear but the bank has appointed receiver PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) to sell the land and recoup as much of the debt as possible.  David Thornhill, a director in PWC's  recovery service and joint receiver, said: "The bank which had lent money for the purchase and development of those sites has appointed a receiver to take control of those sites on its behalf.  "The company was not paying the bank interest and the bank decided to take the site under its own control.  "Our remit is to achieve the highest price for the land in order to repay the bank as much of its debt as possible."  PWC could try to sell the land with the existing outline planning permission to a developer, it could obtain full permission for a specific project and then sell it or it could appoint a contractor to build the site on its behalf before handing it over to the highest bidder.  The receiver still believes the Waterloo Road site will create hundreds of  but, whichever option is chosen, there is likely to be a lengthy delay before any building work starts.  Mr Thornhill said: "We are not looking for an early exit at any cost. We will try to achieve the best value we can."  Lear Management is thought to have already spent 4 million on the scheme.  Richard Day, spokesman for the City Centre Partnership, said: "It's an important site. It's a gateway into the city centre and it would have helped finish off the ring road."  It is understood PWC has submitted a planning application to gain full permission for a non-food  development. Lear Management was unavailable for comment.
