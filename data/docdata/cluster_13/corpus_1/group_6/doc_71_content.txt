A Hamilton man who robbed two banks last year, disguising his identity with scarves and socks, suffered from chronic schizophrenia and frequently used cannabis, the Hamilton District Court was told.  Andrew Joseph, 40, a sickness beneficiary, was sentenced on Friday to five years' jail after pleading guilty to two counts of robbery.  The court heard that, in February last year, Joseph entered the Westpac bank in Hamilton East and demanded cash from a female bank teller, saying he had a gun inside a draw-string bag.  He later escaped on a bike with $2700 cash.  In a second hold-up, in September, Joseph entered the Westpac bank in Hillcrest and demanded cash from a bank teller, saying he had a gun and would use it.  Joseph fled on foot with $2160 cash but was later caught by police.  On each occasion, Joseph disguised his face with a scarf and wore socks over his hands.  Crown prosecutor Sheila Cameron said the female bank tellers were terrified by the robberies and continued to suffer ongoing problems.  Ms Cameron said a pre-sentence report indicated Joseph was a risk to the community and had little ability to empathise with others.  He also used cannabis regularly.  Defence counsel Bruce Hesketh said a psychiatric report on Joseph was a 'chilling document'. Joseph suffered from chronic schizophrenia and did not always take his medication.  Judge Robert Wolff said Joseph's offending was aggravated by his references to guns and his use of disguises. Joseph had an 'appalling' criminal history, with 76 previous convictions, including robbery offences. The judge imposed a minimum non-parole period of three years, citing Joseph's continued substance abuse and his inability to take medication.  He was also convicted and discharged on a charge of assaulting a female.
