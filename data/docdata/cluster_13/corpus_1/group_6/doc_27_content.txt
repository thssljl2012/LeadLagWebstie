YOU cannot accuse the founder of ABC Learning, Eddy Groves, of being a pessimist. He signed on for his second marriage last Thursday, to his long-time partner Viryan Collins-Rubie, in a characteristically lavish affair on the Gold Coast attended by close friends and family.  The sunset ceremony at The Villa, an exclusive venue complete with its own nine-hole golf course, drew howls of outrage from the many victims of ABC Learning's multi-billion dollar collapse.  Dr Le Neve Groves, who finalised her divorce from Mr Groves late last year, may not have been impressed either.  A battle royal is brewing in the Queensland Supreme Court between the two ABC Learning founders, Westpac's BT Securities and Citigroup over margin loans she allegedly guaranteed for her former husband that led to their collective shareholding in ABC Learning being wiped out by margin calls early last year.  In a steady drip of documents lodged with the Queensland Supreme Court in recent months Dr Groves has denied claims by her former husband, and the two margin lenders, that she guaranteed his margin loans, which totalled more than $40 million.  Dr Groves went as far as to claim in the court documents that her signature was forged on the guarantee documents with BT Securities. This is despite statements from the margin lender that its officers witnessed Dr Groves signing the documents.  At stake is $64.2 million, which is the amount Dr Groves is seeking from her former husband and the margin lenders. The figure covers the loss of shares allegedly lodged as security for her former husband's margin loans, which exceeded $40 million, plus more than $10 million in dividends owed to her that were pocketed by her former husband, according to Dr Groves.  In its statement of defence, BT provided details of meetings with the ABC Learning founders at which Dr Groves was allegedly briefed on the guarantees she was asked to provide, was handed documents, and returned them directly to the BT officials fully signed.  BT said that one of its representatives met the Groves in June 2005, and Dr Groves 'executed' the documents giving the guarantee before she handed the documents back to the BT official. At a second meeting at a Westpac office in Brisbane, BT said, Dr Groves met two bank officials where she completed the guarantee by signing the lodging shares form which put the shares offered as security into a BT trust.  In reply to this defence, Dr Groves denies attending either meeting or providing her signature authorising the transaction. 'The signature appearing on the documents referred to  which purport to be that of Dr Groves, were not written by Dr Groves,' she says.
