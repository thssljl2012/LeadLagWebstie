ris wheel on Barrack Street. Joseph Sapienza felt the highs and lows of Perth's latest foreshore attraction.  The Perth Ferris Wheel officially opened today but unfortunately it didn't have me in a spin (sorry to start off with a pun).  There was no big cutting of the ribbon event planned by the marketing and PR flacks at Council House but rather a low-key opening involving Perth Lord Mayor Lisa Scaffidi - who was looking rather resplendent in a pink outfit I must say - and about a dozen members of Perth's media.  I had my doubts about the impact of the Ferris Wheel on the Perth City landscape - and specifically on the dormant Swan River foreshore on the northern side - because it was simply too small.  Whether you're driving up the Narrows Bridge or along the Esplanade in South Perth, the ferris wheel - like former premier Richard Court's beloved bell tower - fails to scream something along the lines of 'CHECK US OUT' to the city and its visitors.  Rather than sitting conspicuously on the edge of the foreshore for all to gaze and marvel at, the wheel merely blends in with the city skyline.  It doesn't overshadow the majestic BankWest Tower nor Central Park, it's just sitting there - mediocre in size. Like a dot on the horizon.  But after all, doesn't our city have a disturbing infatuation with grasping mediocrity whenever Perth gets a chance to emphatically stamp itself on the maps of the world.  To me, the Ferris Wheel appears to be some sort of quick-fix solution by the city brains trust on St Georges Terrace to draw people from far and wide to the central business district and to liven up a foreshore that sees less action than a librarians' convention.  That poses another question. The aim of the wheel is to draw people to the foreshore but what exactly is there at the foreshore that will encourage the 'ferris-wheelers' to stick around.
