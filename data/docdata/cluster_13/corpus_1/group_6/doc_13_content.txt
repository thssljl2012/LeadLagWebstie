 A Rapid City woman is homeless after a late-morning fire caused the roof of her home to collapse. Fire officials were called to the home on Haines Avenue just after 11 a.m. No one was home at the time and it didn't take long for the fire to destroy the house.   Smoke could be seen from blocks away as more than three dozen fire officials worked to control the flames inside this home. The task shut down one of the busiest streets in Rapid City for hours. 'The construction and design of the home itself, there's the possibility of hidden fires, which obviously can weaken the structure, making it unsafe. And the fact that they need to get in there and expose those fires so they can begin the investigation,' Rapid City Fire Department Captain Mark Kirchgesler said.   By the time firefighters made it to the scene, there was already fire on both floors, making it impossible to fight from the inside. 'Crews were pulled out because of the extent of the damage to the structure. And since that time we've been working on ventilating, extinguishment,' Kirchgesler said. Firefighters sprayed water from the ground, above the home and even cut holes in the siding to help ventilate the smoke and find flames, but not quickly enough. The fire spread to the roof, causing it to collapse.   The cause is unknown and could take a while to investigate. 'That could be a fairly lengthy process due to the extent of the damage to the building and of course we'll have to have interviews with the occupant to see what may have led up to the fire and things like that,' Kirchgesler said. Neighbors say the woman who lived in the house had pets, but firefighters couldn't say whether the animals got out safely.  A fund is being set up for the victim at U.S. Bank.
