An alleged bank robber has been identified as one of the men responsible for a town of Verona home invasion through a DNA match.  A DNA test run by the state crime lab linked Jarrell A. Murray, 23, to the home invasion case on Cross Country Road that occurred on March 9, 2008, according to a news release from the Dane County Sheriff's Office.  Murray is currently in the Dane County Jail awaiting federal charges for his involvement in a string of bank robberies in May last year.  In the home invasion case, a town of Verona woman and her children were napping in their home on the 7200 block of Cross Country Road when the incident occurred.  The woman awoke at approximately 2 p.m. and found a man approaching her daughter's bedroom door. The men fled once they realized someone was home.  Dane County Sheriff's Office detectives submitted evidence to the state crime lab, and the DNA match was made while also investigating the string of bank robberies.  The home invasion case remains open, as a second man who has yet to be identified was believed to be involved.  Murray and three others previously were indicted by a federal grand jury in October 2008 after they were accused of robbing the Bank Mutual on Odana Road in Madison and the US Bank on Cottage Grove Road in the town of Blooming Grove.  Murray faced charges of conspiracy to commit bank robbery for the two bank heists and for using a firearm in the second robbery.  If convicted, he faces 25 years on each of the two bank robbery charges. Murray also faces five years in prison on the conspiracy charge and a mandatory consecutive term of seven years if convicted of using a weapon.  Murray has a history of convictions for felonies, including one for substantial battery in 2006.
