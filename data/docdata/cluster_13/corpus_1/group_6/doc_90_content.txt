On behalf of the Toledo Eagles No. 2219, I would like to thank the community for participating in the senior citizens Christmas Giving Tree. The gifts the seniors received filled a void and delighted them to think someone thought of them during the holidays. There were over 200 gifts received for our seniors.  I wish to especially thank Washington Federal Savings and Loan and West Coast Bank branches in Newport, Toledo, Lincoln City and Depoe Bay for providing the trees and staff time to promote the project. Also to the Lincoln City Chamber of Commerce and US Bank of Lincoln City, for participating in this event.  When I delivered a package to an elderly gentleman, he was amazed that someone had bought him a package of socks, which he really needed. Some of these people cry when they receive these gifts. Santa cries too. Many of our seniors have outlived their family members, or they live so far away from them that they spend the holidays alone. Numbers of seniors live on limited incomes and don't have the money for a lot of essential things that the rest of us take for granted.
