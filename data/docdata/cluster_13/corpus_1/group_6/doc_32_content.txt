 . A La Crosse man who helped rob a North Side bar was spared prison Thursday so he can be treated for post-traumatic stress disorder his family said was triggered by military service in Iraq.  Jacob Ward, 22, was placed on 10 years of probation and ordered to serve a year in the La Crosse County Jail, with credit for 314 days, under the sentence handed down by La Crosse County Circuit Judge Elliott Levine.   Levine also imposed a stayed three-year prison sentence and five years of extended supervision.  Ward will be admitted to the Tomah VA Hospital as soon as a bed is available for treatment of his PTSD.  Ward was convicted with two other men in the March 4, 2008, armed robbery of the George Street Pub, 1728 George St. Ward reportedly grabbed two bank bags containing $1,606 while roommate Phillip Herrera, 26, blocked the doorway with a gun supplied by another roommate, 24-year-old Parker Ostrander, according to the criminal complaint.  The money and gun were recovered from their home at 1813 George St.  All three were convicted of being party to the crime of armed robbery with threat of force.  Herrera and Ostrander both were sentenced to 10 years in prison and terms of extended supervision.  But Ward deserved different treatment because the other men were building criminal records while Ward was fighting in Iraq, Wards mother, Lorraine, said during sentencing.Wards short statement to the court included apologies to the victims and community.I never thought in a million years I would do something like this, he said. .
