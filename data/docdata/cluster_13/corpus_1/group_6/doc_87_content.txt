 The 20th annual Hudson Hot Air Affair is coming to Hudson Feb. 6-8. The 'Roaring 20's' is the theme for this year's event, said balloon coordinator Carla Timmerman.  M&amp;I Bank-Hudson is again the major sponsor of the annual balloon rally and winter event and commissioned the commercial balloon banners for the occasion.  The M&amp;I balloon is owned and piloted by Dale Dommer, Ottumwa, Iowa, and the large blue and white M&amp;I banners can be seen from both sides of the 110,000-cubic-foot Cameron envelope. This is Dommer's fourth year at the Hudson Hot Air Affair.  'We're happy to be the Hudson Hot Air Affair corporate sponsor again this year,' said M&amp;I Bank-Hudson branch manager Lee Anderson. 'Our company and staff like the community event and enjoy being part of the winter celebration.'  This year's other commercial balloons are US Bank, Stillwater Balloons and ReMax North Central and ReMax Associates Plus Inc., the owner of the ReMax realty company in Hudson.  The Hot Air Affair is one of the largest winter hot air ballooning events in the country. Special shapes are Rubber Duckie and Biddles.
