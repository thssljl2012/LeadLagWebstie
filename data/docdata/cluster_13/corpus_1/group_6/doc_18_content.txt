GLENN BILLEY has been hit harder than most by the global financial crisis. He had a job as a car salesman at Barry Smith Holden in Pennant Hills six months ago. Now Mr Billey sells the Big Issue outside Central Station each day to pay his bills.   He is homeless, he says, but remains positive. 'Hope never dies, you know. You start giving up hope, you start giving up [on] life, on yourself.' Mr Billey, who turned 40 on Sunday, said his story could be anyone's in the current financial climate. 'I've never been homeless before. I'm sort of trying to rebuild again and climb the rungs again, but it's very difficult.' His dream is to own an internet car sales business, but he said he might have to rethink his ambitions because of the economic crisis. The car industry experienced a 3.6 per cent sales drop last year and is bracing for a further downturn of between 10 and 20 per cent this year.   Richelle Pellegrini is another casualty of the big job losses. A former communications consultant at Westpac, Ms Pellegrini was made redundant during the bank's merger with St George late last year. Ms Pellegrini, who has two young daughters, said the timing 'hasn't been great'. 'We have a mortgage like most other people. We certainly weren't expecting it that's for sure.' The timing was even worse for Rory Myers, who was made redundant just two weeks before Christmas. Mr Myers, of Tempe, said he had been working for a large demolition company for 18 months when he was told he was no longer needed.   Several other experienced employees had also lost their jobs at the same company. 'I couldn't pay my rent. I've got a brand new baby at home. I couldn't do anything.' He has since found another job, but 'it's nowhere near the pay rate, and I'm really struggling at the moment'.
