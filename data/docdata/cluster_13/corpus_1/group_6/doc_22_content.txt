NEWPORT - The Target store planned for Newport Pavilion will not open for at least another year, the national retailer said.  Montgomery-based Bear Creek Capital, which is overseeing the 56-acre project off of Interstate 471, had said it expected Target to open later this year. 'Target remains committed to a location in Newport, but at this point it's just too premature to talk about opening dates,' said Anna Anderson, Target spokeswoman. 'As a rule, we only confirm dates that are one year from opening.' Anderson declined to comment further of the project. Officials at Bear Creek and the city of Newport could not be reached Thursday.  Currently, Kroger is constructing a 120,000-square-foot grocery at the site, which is expected to open this summer. Bear Creek has said other tenants should include a Famous Footwear, Cincinnati Bell/T-Mobile cell-phone store, Tire Discounters, Cincinnati Tan and a Chinese restaurant.  Meanwhile, mechanics liens continue to mount on another highly visible Bear Creek project: the $175 million Kenwood Towne Place in Sycamore Township.  Since November, Hamilton County Recorder documents show that liens totaling more than $18.2 million have been filed against the 10-story development, which is next to Kenwood Towne Centre.  Among the largest creditors are Columbus-based Structural Solutions, which filed a lien in December for $4.6 million; Dayton-based Maxim Crane for $2.5 million; Glendale-based Ford Development Corp. for $1.3 million and Milford-based Jarvis Mechanical for $1.5 million  Earlier this month, Bear Creek principal and managing partner Matt Daniels said the firm planned to begin paying off the contractors over the next 30 days as it worked out budget issues with its investors and lender Bank of America.
