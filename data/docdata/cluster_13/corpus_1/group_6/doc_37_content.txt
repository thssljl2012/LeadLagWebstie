PROVIDENCE  A group of protesters carried a childs coffin through downtown yesterday in a mock funeral procession to denounce government violence, ranging from the states housing crisis to Israels attack on Gaza to the shooting death of a teenage boy in Greece by the police.   About 40 people, some with horns and drums, marched around noon at Burnside Park near Kennedy Plaza in a bone-chilling wind. Three young women carried the black Styrofoam coffin that was filled with flowers. They stopped and left flowers in front of the Bank of America building, Textron, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a Providence police substation and the R.I. Army National Guard recruitment center.   At the Bank of America building, Graham Sutherland, a student organizer with Providence Industrial Workers of the World, said the housing crisis has led to a flood of foreclosures. We are here in recognition that Bank of America and other financial institutions like them are to blame for the crisis, he said. Last month, Bank of America foreclosed on a house on Potters Avenue in Providence and told all residents to leave. But that same day a coalition of 80 activists organized an eviction blockade, he said. Denying housing to people is an act of violence, Sutherland said. The protest was organized by What Queer, a newly formed group of activists, in conjunction with other organizations.   At the Textron world headquarters building, Tom Judd, an organizer with Students for a Democratic Society, said Textron is one of the worlds war profiteers. Shaun Joseph, a graduate student at the University of Rhode Island, said, What is happening in Gaza is a complete atrocity. The U.S. government is supporting Israel with billions a year. Its my responsibility to say my government is not representing me.
