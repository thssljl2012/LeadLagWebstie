HARRISBURG -- Pennsylvania has joined a settlement with Countrywide Financial Corp. that makes available as much as $155 million to help keep thousands of state residents in their homes.  Thirty other states have signed agreements with Bank of America Corp., which acquired Countrywide last year and announced in October that it would pay more than $8 billion for interest rate and principal reductions for nearly 400,000 customers nationwide.  The Pennsylvania deal was announced Wednesday by state Attorney General Tom Corbett, whose office spent several months investigating alleged deceptive mortgage practices by Countrywide and its affiliates.  Most of the Pennsylvania money -- about $150 million -- is earmarked for as many as 10,200 subprime and pay-option borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages sold through Countrywide.  Consumers can call Countrywide's hot line -- (800) 669-6607 -- for more information.
