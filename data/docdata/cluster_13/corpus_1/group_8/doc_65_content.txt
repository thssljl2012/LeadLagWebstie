NEW YORK, March 26 (Reuters) - Former tennis champion John McEnroe was duped along with investment firms, art owners and collectors and the Bank of America in a sophisticated $88 million art investment scam revealed in New York on Thursday.  Art dealer Lawrence Salander, 59, was arrested at his New York home on Thursday, when he and his gallery were charged with 100 counts, including grand larceny and securities fraud, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau told a news conference.  Officials said there are 26 victims of Salander's scheme including McEnroe, who invested $2 million for a half share of two paintings, Arshile Gorky's 'Pirate I and II.' McEnroe never recouped the money after his share in the paintings was sold to another collector, authorities said.  Morgenthau said the scheme, which lasted from 1994 to 2007, included luring investors who paid cash in exchange for shares of ownership of works of art. 'He sold artwork not owned by him and kept the money and lured investment money in fraudulent investment opportunities,' Morgenthau said, adding Salander used the money to fund 'an extravagant lifestyle' of lavish parties and private jets.  Some of the scams worked like the plot of the musical 'The Producers,' which includes a get-rich scheme by overselling interests in a show, Morgenthau said. Similarly, Salander at times inflated the value of paintings to score greater investments that were not returned to investors. Continued...
