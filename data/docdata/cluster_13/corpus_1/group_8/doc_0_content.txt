A union has accused councils of underpaying their workers for the past 15 years by misinterpreting a collective bargaining agreement.  Consequently, the Kenya Local Government Workers Union (KLGWU) now wants the civic authorities to rectify the anomaly and pay workers their dues or risk a strike.  Among the local authorities affected is Nyahururu Municipal Council, which has been given up to the end of this month to implement the proper pay scales as contained in the CBA signed in 1993.  The unions general secretary, Mr Boniface Munyao, said the councils had been underpaying workers through use of diagonal line instead of straight ruler conversion of the CBA figures.  The Nyahururu chapter of the union sought intervention of the national office after local efforts failed to yield results.  A worker who expects to be paid Sh100,000 in arrears said the council had for a long time been playing games with the union officials.
