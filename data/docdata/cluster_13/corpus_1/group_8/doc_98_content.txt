In Athens, a car bomb has exploded outside a bank.  The bomb damaged two cars but caused no injuries when it exploded outside a branch of Citibank in the Nea Ionia district.   No one has claimed responsibility for the blast which follows another car bomb detonation outside a Citibank office last month.  It is believed the bombs are part of a campaign of violence by far-left militants.  Greece has faced severe anti-government protests and rioting since the death of a teenager at the hands of police in December.
