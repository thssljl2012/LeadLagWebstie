A bomb exploded outside a Citibank branch in Athens, Greece, causing damage but no injuries.  Police said the bomb went off at 3am local time in the Nea Ionia district of the capital. The blast, behind the two-storey bank building, damaged parked cars.  There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, and police said they had received no warning call, but the target of the attack pointed to Greek far-left militant groups, which have become increasingly aggressive following the police shooting of a 15-year-old boy in December  an incident that sparked the countrys worst riots in decades.
