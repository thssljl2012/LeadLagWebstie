(Tulsa World - McClatchy-Tribune Information Services via COMTEX News Network) --  Bankrupt SemGroup LP told employees in a memo Thursday that it's 'winding down' SemMaterials and will lay off most of the unit's 550 workers.  Meanwhile, the Tulsa-based energy company's publicly traded subsidiary, SemGroup Energy Partners LP, received more breathing room from its creditors.  SemGroup LP CEO Terry Ronan told workers at SemMaterials, the company's asphalt unit, that the employees will be let go within a few weeks. The public SemGroup has agreed to take over some of SemMaterials' assets in a settlement between the one-time partners.  The wind-down, as Ronan called it in the memo, will include ceasing SemMaterials' operations at SemGroup's south campus, 6125 S. Yale Ave., and will result in the layoff, over time, of 'most, if not all SemMaterials employees, with the exception of those employees transferred to SGLP (SemGroup Energy) or other SemGroup business units.'  SemMaterials employs 551 companywide, including 135 in Tulsa, officials said.  SemGroup had 400 people in Tulsa before running into problems last year. A spokesman said Thursday that SemGroup's overall employment now is 276 locally and 1,962 companywide. So, if most of the local SemMaterials workers are let go, SemGroup would be down to about 35 percent of its peak employment in Tulsa.  Ronan's  memo did not mention severance packages for those laid off but noted that they will be offered outplacement services to help find new employment.  'The fact that you have all worked so hard makes this all the more difficult, particularly for those of you who will be leaving us,' Ronan wrote. 'I want you to know how much I appreciate your contribution to SemGroup and sincerely wish we had another option.'  SemGroup said in court filings that it was losing $15 million a month through SemMaterials.  SemGroup Energy, the public partnership that is taking over part of SemMaterials, has challenges of its own. SemGroup Energy must file its 2008 financial reports by April 8 to satisfy its lenders, according to the company's Thursday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The new forbearance agreement helps the struggling SemGroup Energy while it deals with the revenue losses brought by SemGroup LP's July 2008 bankruptcy. The public SGLP so far has not filed bankruptcy but had $448 million in debt as of late last year, suffered its own default and has had a considerable drop in revenue related to its parent's fall.  Wachovia, Bank of America and other senior lenders basically are allowing SGLP nearly three weeks to get its books straight and out into the open. The oil and asphalt storage and transport partnership has not filed a quarterly earnings report since May 2008.  The deal with lenders marks the third amendment to the forbearance agreement since SGLP suffered its credit default last summer. Two hedge funds, Manchester Securities and Alerian Capital Management, took board control of the public company after SemGroup LP defaulted on a $150 million loan in July.
