In federal court Nguyen pleaded not guilty to charges of stealing from the government and money laundering. Nguyen's parents live in Taylorsville. Family members we talked to say they had no idea any of this was going on, I don't even know he went to Iraq He doesn't talk about his work at home. They claim they never received any money from Nguyen.  Officials say this is the first case of its kind. U.S. Attorney for Oregon says, It's really a case about betrayal, money and greed.
