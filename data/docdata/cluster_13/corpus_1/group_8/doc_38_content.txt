Salander, the one-time co-owner and manager of Salander-O'Reilly Galleries LLC, and the gallery have been charged with grand larceny, securities fraud, forgery, falsifying business records and other charges.  Salander, who co-founded the gallery in 1976 and ran its day-to-day operations until it closed in November 2007  Morgenthau said Salander, 59 years old, allegedly defrauded 26 victims out of millions of dollars by selling artwork he didn't own and keeping the money and luring people to invest in fraudulent ownership interests involving works of art.  Salander applied for a personal loan from Bank of America  As a result, Salander was able to obtain a $2 million  Salander used the stolen funds to finance his 'mission to corner the market in Renaissance Art' and to support his extravagant lifestyle, including travel on private jets, a lavish party for his wife at the Frick Collection in New York  -By   Chad Bray
