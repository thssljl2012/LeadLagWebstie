 Brand Keys discovered in its new index that successful brands stand out because of value, not price. In its 2009 Brand Keys Customer Loyalty Index, the marketing firm found that customer expectations in relation to brand value jumped 20 percent this year over last year   Those brands winning the highest levels of loyalty and engagement assessments among respondents included Avis, JetBlue, Bank of America, Zyrtec, Sam Adams, Cheerios, Allstate, Dunkin Donuts, Mary Kay, Kodak, W Hotels, Scottrade, Iams, McDonalds, Grey Goose, ABC TV, Nike, Apple, Walmart, the NFL and Toms of Maine. Brand difference and brand value have increased in terms of percent contribution they make to engagement loyalty and profitability, said Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys. That means the consumer who has been handling that on their own for a while now expects, generally speaking, that their brands will provide that. I think what you are seeing is not only the effects of the economy the economy may have been a catalyst people are looking for best value for price. Passikoff pointed out that consumers even subject commodities like home heating oil to the value influence. Its a commodity, but if the guy is offering you a low or no-cost service contract and is willing to come out to fix the heater versus someone who will sell you heating oil for 50 cents less price isnt the issue, its value. And for each of the brands who are winners, you can find a point in time where they literally own some aspect of what drives the category. NACS Online  Posted / Last update 06-03-2009
