* Bank lawyer says $1.4 million reasonable start for talks  * Govt lawyer says even $800 million reported offer is small  * Settlement likely to be around $200 million - analyst  (Adds judge, analyst, lawyer comments, changes headline)  MOSCOW, March 10 (Reuters) - A Moscow court has adjourned the Russian government's $22.5 billion lawsuit against the Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N) while the two sides discuss a possible settlement, a court judge said on Tuesday.  Negotiations over the size of the settlement, however, are likely to be difficult, as the two sides voiced radically different ideas about how much it should cost to end the case.  The bank's lead outside council said $1.4 million could be a reasonable starting place for the talks.  For nearly two years, the Russian government has been seeking compensation from the U.S. bank after a former vice-president helped transfer $7 billion out of Russia in the late 1990s through Bank of New York accounts.  Last week, hemmed in by a looming budget deficit and the need to raise money for combating the financial crisis, the government offered to discuss a settlement. The bank accepted.  'Now we are discussing the details of the meeting or meetings that can take place this week,' Ivan Marisin, the bank's lead council, told the court.  A source close to the case said the first meeting would take place on Wednesday, while Marisin's co-council, Jonathan Schiller, said he hoped for a resolution by week's end.  Judge Lyudmila Pulova scheduled the next hearing for April 14. 'Probably this will be the last hearing of the case,' she said.
