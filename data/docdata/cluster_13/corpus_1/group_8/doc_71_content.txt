economy that has halted developments and forced the doors of businesses to close, those who promote the counties of the Northland are still able to highlight economic strengths and are looking forward with anticipation.  And whats good for one, is good for the other.  Executive Director of Platte County Economic Development Pete Fullerton said although there are differences, when attracting developers and business to the area, county lines are often arbitrary and each benefits from the economic growth of the other.  Jim Hampton, Clay County economic development executive director, said his competition is not Platte County, but other cities.   If we can convince that company to come to theKansas City area, obviously I want Clay County first, but if I cant get them to Clay County, Im more than happy if we can help them locate in Platte County because were going to benefit from some of those jobs, he said.  Both directors said their respective counties are good places to live and work, offer premier education and are easy to navigate. And for economic development, both offer competitive pricing and access to several highways, major draws for many businesses.  Both also cite the Kansas City International Airport as a major draw even though it is in Platte County.  Hampton said one of the top selling points and biggest strengths of Clay County was its amount of undeveloped land.  He said there is approximately 55 percent of undeveloped open space in the county, a large part of which is north of Liberty, around Smithville and Kearney.  Progress will continue in the Shoal Creek Valley, where there is 1,700 acres of land being developed on the south side of Liberty and also in the U.S. Highway 169 corridor in the area around Interstate 435, Hampton said.  Even two retail developments that appear to be sore spots, Metro North Mall and Antioch Center are not viewed as county weaknesses. They are being planned for redeveloped in coming years to again become highlights of the area.  In Platte County, Fullerton said one slight weakness is vacancy in office buildings surrounding the airport.   Ten years ago a majority of the offices near the airport were filled, Fullerton said, but he has confidence they will be again because of the increased number of amenities that have become available in the past decade.   It gives me a lot of confidence that we are going to see another wave of new, strong corporate growth in our community because we have those pieces in place, he said.  Shopping, entertainment, recreation and housing have all increased in the area.  He said the county was lucky to see the completion of two of these amenities, the second phase of Zona Rosa and the Tiffany Springs Market Center, before the long arms of the recession had a chance to grab and halt them.  He said the amenities and amount of undeveloped dirt around the airport will continue to draw business to the county, which overall will benefit the entire Northland.   Generally, in our sub-region of the Kansas City area, whats good for Clay County is good for Platte County, Fullerton said. Theyre competing, but also very collaborative when you look at the Northland together.
