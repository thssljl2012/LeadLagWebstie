Malaysian budget carrier Air Asia are still in talks with Manchester United on the possibility of another sponsorship tieup from 2010 onwards.  That's following the expiry of their previous 2-year deal, which saw the airline as the official low-cost carrier for the Red Devils in this region.  Recently, Insurance giants AIG announced that, they would not be renewing their shirt title sponsorship deal with Man United from next year onwards.  And that's prompted a great deal of interest from several corporate entities including India's Sahara group.  Well Air Asia CEO Tony Fernandez who was in Singapore yesterday, said they too might be keen to explore the shirt deal.  And with next week's debut of AirAsia's KL to London route, Dato Fernandez is also keen to provide regional football fans, a cost-effective way of travelling to catch EPL games.  The AirAsia boss was here to provide more news on his latest venture.  Applications are now open for any parties who might be interested in forming a new franchise to feature in the inaugural Asean Basketball League.  Also known as the ABL, the league will see 8 new teams from South East Asia competing over a 5 month period on a home-and-away basis.  Presently, the Singapore Slingers with their track record of having featured here for 3 years, is the 1st franchise to submit their application into the ABL.  Any other local potential parties must satisfy a range of criteria including a Million-dollar bankers guarantee and source for their own sponsorship.  The Asean Basketball League who's chairman is Dato Fernandez, will start in September and it'll see teams parading a bulk of local talents, which is part of a mandatory requirement.
