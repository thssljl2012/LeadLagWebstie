'We are proud to have the opportunity to recognize and honour those individuals who have gone above and beyond the call of duty to prevent and investigate crimes against Canada's financial institutions,' said Nancy Hughes Anthony, President and CEO of the Canadian Bankers Association. 'This is a chance to show our appreciation for the excellent work done by members of law enforcement to protect the security and safety of bank employees and customers.' Nominations from banks and Canadian law enforcement agencies will be accepted until April 30, 2009. Additional information about the nomination process and eligibility, as well as a list of past award recipients, can be found on the CBA website at www.cba.ca/award.   Since the creation of the CBLEA in 1972, 212 officers from across Canada have been honoured for their outstanding bravery, investigative ability and other noteworthy achievements to combat crimes against the banking industry in Canada. This year's awards will be presented at the closing ceremony and dinner of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police annual conference in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island on August 12, 2009.   The Canadian Bankers Association works on behalf of 50 domestic chartered banks, foreign bank subsidiaries and foreign bank branches operating in Canada and their 257,000 employees to advocate for efficient and effective public policies governing banks and to promote an understanding of the banking industry and its importance to Canadians and the Canadian economy.
