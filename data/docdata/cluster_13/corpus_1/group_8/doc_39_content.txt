I am amazed that the federal government has bailed out the big banks with tax dollars. Citibank has repaid customers by increasing rates on credit cards. So, it gets my tax dollars and my increased interest. This is really helping the American people in a time of need. I thank Bush, Obama and Citibank for helping the middle class.  Jill S.
