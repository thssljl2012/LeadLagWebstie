SARASOTA - Former economics professor and bank treasurer Terry Turner captured 41 percent of the vote in Tuesday's Sarasota City Commission election, making him the top vote-getter.  Turner, Paul Caragiulo and Suzanne Atwell now face a runoff campaign. Because none of the nine candidates garnered at least a majority of the votes, the top three are in a runoff scheduled for April 14. The top two vote-getters in the runoff will fill the seats of Commissioner Lou Ann Palmer, who is retiring, and Commissioner Ken Shelin, who lost his re-election bid after placing fourth in Tuesday's vote. 'We got a positive response to my message that we need sustainable growth and we need to protect the environment in the neighborhoods,' Turner said from his election victory party downtown at the Bungalow Restaurant.  Turner disputed claims that he was against development. 'I was in business for 25 years,' said the onetime corporate treasurer for Bank of America. 'And I believe business is good for Sarasota. It has to be development that is compatible with neighborhoods. It can't be boom-and-bust speculation real estate.' Turner said he is going to start his runoff campaign after the weekend and start fundraising and going door-to-door Monday morning.  Turner raised $26,000 in campaign contributions, more than the other candidates.  Restaurateur Paul Caragiulo had 35 percent of the vote, with 2,429 votes. Caragiulo quickly rose as a favorite for some business leaders who say he came across as the type of candidate who would not buckle to pressure from small groups.  Matt Orr, who lives downtown and started the online newsletter 'This Week in Sarasota,' said Caragiulo was one of his top candidates because he would focus on downtown and jobs. 'All of our friends are leaving because they can't get good jobs,' Orr said. 'The city needs to focus on creative, sustainable jobs.' Atwell spent most of the campaign going door to door, including an encounter with a dog that bit her.
