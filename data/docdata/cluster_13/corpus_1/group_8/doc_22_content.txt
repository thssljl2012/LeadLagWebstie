(Tulsa World - McClatchy-Tribune Information Services via COMTEX) -- A Tulsan who pleaded guilty to robbing two Tulsa banks on the same day received a 20-year prison sentence Monday.  Christopher Rodman, 26, was on probation for another felony offense at the time of the robberies, records show.  He pleaded guilty Monday to two counts of first- degree robbery. In accordance with a plea agreement, Tulsa County District Judge William Kellough imposed a 20-year term that requires Rodman to serve at least 85 percent -- or 17 years -- before he is eligible for parole.  Rodman robbed the Valley National Bank at 2021 E. 21st St. on the morning of Jan. 8 and robbed the Bank of America at 4847 S. Peoria Ave. that afternoon.  Police reviewed surveillance videos and determined that the same man had robbed both banks by handing over notes demanding specific amounts of cash.  When Rodman was arrested the next day at the Brook Alley Bar, 4726 S. Peoria Ave., he had a note demanding cash with him, police said.  Police received a Crime Stoppers hot line tip naming Rodman as a suspect.  Rodman received a three-year suspended sentence Oct. 7 upon pleading guilty to a charge of using a forged or revoked credit/debit card on Sept. 12, records show.  In that case, he used the card to obtain food and drinks at a Utica Square restaurant, records show.  Kellough revoked that probation Monday and imposed a three-year prison term that will run concurrently with -- meaning it won't add to -- the 20-year sentence.
