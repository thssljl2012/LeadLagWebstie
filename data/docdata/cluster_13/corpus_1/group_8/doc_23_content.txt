Even young bankers such as Jacob, 6, and his mates, top are keen to see a community bank in Heidelberg. JANINE EASTGATE N36HB708  THE proposed Heidelberg community bank has moved closer to reality with pledges breaking the $800,000 mark.  The achievement - in less than six months - has enabled the projects steering committee to begin a four-week feasibility study to test the viability of a community banking service.  The committees chairman Brett Purchase said it was a crucial stage in determining if the bank would succeed.  He urged local residents, shoppers, and business operators to complete the survey.  The study would give us a stronger indication as to whether people in the local area will become customers or not, Mr Purchase said.  He said the community bank could open its doors as early as July.  But we still need to get a number of things done, and that includes the feasibility study report, people putting their hands in their pocket and putting their money in, and weve got to find a location, he said.  The push for the community bank began when the NAB branch in Burgundy St closed its doors last May.  Weve got about 230 pledges at this point in time, and there are more trickling in, Mr Purchase said. I just want to encourage the Heidelberg community to continue to support us and get the branch up and running as fast as we can.  The feasibility study survey will be mailed to local homes and businesses, and needs to be completed and returned before Friday, April 3.
