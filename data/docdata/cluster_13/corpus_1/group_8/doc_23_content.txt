INDIAN conglomerate Tata Group is the latest name in the frame as a potential Manchester United shirt sponsor.  United's four-year contract with AIG expires in May next year, but the US insurance giant said in January it would not be renewing the deal.  The European and world champions have already sent a sponsorship proposal to another Indian company, the Sahara Group, while others linked to a deal include Saudi Telecom, AirAsia and Prudential.  Tata's interests span steel, cars, IT, tea, power, communications and hotels. In the UK it owns Cheshire's Brunner Mond, Jaguar LandRover and tea firm Tetley.  Manchester United remains bullish about its financial position despite coming under attack from Dave Whelan.  The straight-talking Wigan Athletic owner singled out United and Liverpool for criticism, due to the massive debts they incurred gaining new American owners.  At a time of belt-tightening everywhere, amid an ongoing global economic crisis, Whelan fears for the financial future of the game, and many wonder how well prepared United and Liverpool are to respond.  While the strained relationship between co-owners Tom Hicks and George Gillett does not make for the most stable of backdrops at Anfield, over at Old Trafford work continues as normal.  Privately, some question the paradox of Mr Whelan complaining about debt levels while at the same time bankrolling Wigan to an extent they certainly could not afford to maintain should his funding ever dry up.  However, there will be no public condemnation, nor any justification for United's present position, after a year when it increased turnover 20 per cent to 257.1m.  Analysts will need to wait for United to post annual results, at some point over the next few weeks, to start working out what the present debt position is.  The Glazer family has already ditched one attempt at restructuring their loans because the terms were not favourable.
