POCATELLO - Hundreds of women were at Idaho State University Wednesday for the ninth annual Women and Work conference.  The event is designed to help women learn more about non-traditional careers which often provide higher wages, and better benefit packages.  The women also attended workshops talking about setting goals, and money management. Tracy Hoart, District Manager for US Bank said, 'There isn't a lot of places where you can gain that information, and I think it's also good for people to talk about their career paths so they can teach others.'  Many also spent time talking with representatives from law enforcement, auto mechanics, electronics, and technology fields.
