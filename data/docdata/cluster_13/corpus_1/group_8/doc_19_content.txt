Pride Micro Finance, in partnership with American International Group (AIG), is to clear all loans owed by Nakivubo Park Yard vendors.  Mr Venansio Ndyabahika, Pride Micro Finance city branch manager, said their loans are covered by the credit life insurance policy taken out with AIG.  People having loans with Pride Micro finance will have all their outstanding loan balances paid by AIG, Mr Ndyabahika said during the handing over of timber, worth of Shs2 million, to help in the re-construction of Owino.  Our borrowers are prone to disaster so we took out a policy to protect them, this will also apply to Jinja traders whose businesses were destroyed by fire at Jinja Central Market recently.  Recently, AIG Uganda issued a statement to micro finance institutions assuring them of partnership in re-paying the loans.  We assure you that AIG will settle the resulting loses and loan amounts disbursed instantly, the statement read in part.  This would be effected upon documentation and in agreement with the loan and property loss catastrophe provisions in the policy contract, the statement reads in part.  AIG would pay the claims lodged instantly but had also commissioned an independent investigation into the fire incident.  Mr Ndyabahika said more than 439 vendors will have their outstanding loans cleared but anticipated an increase in the number as registration is still going on.  The vendors should not lose hope because they will only have to look for money to re-start their businesses without having the burden of clearing bank loans, they can also apply for more bank loans once they are back into business, he said.  Property worth Shs15 billion was gutted by fire at St. Balikuddembe Market formerly known as Owino Market on Febuary 25.
