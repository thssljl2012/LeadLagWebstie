S&amp;K Menswear plans to close its two Memphis area stores as the company tries to reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy.  The chain of clothing stores is shutting down 30 locations nationwide, including those in Wolfchase Galleria in Memphis and the Southlake Center in Southaven.  S&amp;K Famous Brands Inc. filed for bankruptcy last month. Bryan Kipp, the company's vice president of marketing, said S&amp;K plans to focus on stores in larger markets as part of its recovery strategy.  Liquidation sales have already begun at the stores targeted for closure and will continue until the remaining merchandise is sold. That process is expected to take between 30 and 90 days, Kipp said.  Firm hires new attorneys  Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell &amp; Berkowitz PC, a Memphis-based law firm, has expanded its insurance regulatory practice by adding two attorneys.  The firm hired Lee Harrell, who formerly worked for the Mississippi Insurance Department, and Melissa L. Hull, formerly an attorney for Nationwide Insurance's south central region.  Harrell works out of the firm's Jackson, Miss., office and Hull is based in the firm's Nashville office.

'These new facilities will provide Midtown residents with three medical services in one convenient location,' Methodist administrator of outpatient services Juloy Raymer said in a statement.  Both new centers are open from 5 p.m. until 11 p.m., Monday through Friday, and noon until 9 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.
