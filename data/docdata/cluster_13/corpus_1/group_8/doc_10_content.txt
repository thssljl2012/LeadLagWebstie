ATHENS, Greece - A bomb exploded outside a Citibank branch in Athens early Monday causing damage but no injury, authorities said.   Police said the bomb went off at 3 a.m. local time Monday in the Nea Ionia district of the capital. The blast, behind the bank building, damaged several parked cars. Police said the bomb was detonated from very close to the blast site, with the use of electric cables.   There was no claim of responsibility for the attack, and police said they had received no warning call.   But the target of the attack pointed to Greek far-left militant groups, which have become increasingly aggressive following the police shooting of a 15-year-old boy in December - an incident that sparked the country's worst riots in decades.   Nobody has been killed so far, but authorities fear continued attacks will result in loss of life.   Last month, police destroyed a car bomb abandoned outside Citibank offices in Athens, which contained enough explosives to crumble a four-story building. There has been no claim of responsibility.
