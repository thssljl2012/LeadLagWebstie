Two of four men charged with robbing a bank in the town of Blooming Grove last year face possible life prison terms after a federal jury found them guilty Thursday night. Corey J. Thomas, 28, and Prince P. Beck, 25, both of Madison, were convicted of armed bank robbery and conspiring to commit armed bank robberies after a four-day jury trial in U.S. District Court.  Co-conspirators Lamar Liggons, 22, and Michael Simmons, 28, both of Chicago, earlier pleaded guilty to taking part in the May 21 robbery at the U.S. Bank. Both testified against the other two men.  The jury acquitted Thomas and Beck on one count that charged them with robbing the Bank Mutual on Odana Road on May 9.
