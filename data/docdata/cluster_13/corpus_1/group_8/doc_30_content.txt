The owners of a Far North Dallas shopping center have secured almost $14 million in new debt for the property.   The refinancing of the Preston Trail Village shopping center at 17194 Preston Road is one of the few such recent transactions announced in the Dallas area.   With the credit crunch and tougher bank underwriting standards, very few commercial real estate mortgage transactions have been completed so far this year.   The Dallas office of Holliday Fenoglio Fowler LP said Tuesday that it arranged a three-year fixed-rate loan for the property with American Bank of Texas.   The 179,959-square-foot shopping center near State Highway 190 is owned by Inland Western REIT of Illinois.   The retail project is more than 90 percent leased with tenants including Kroger, Bank of America, Dunkin Donuts and Hallmark Showcase. Holliday Fenoglios Kevin MacKenzie and Trey Morsbach negotiated the new mortgage.
