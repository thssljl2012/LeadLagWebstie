BEHIND THE LAYOFFS  Duncan says business aircraft is greatly  misunderstood  All the talk about fat-cat executives flying in private jets to Washington, D.C., to beg for money to bail out their financially strapped companies has been big trouble for companies like Duncan Aviation.  The provider of business-aircraft maintenance and support service cited the ailing economy and the credit crisis ''as well as political and media grandstanding against the business-aviation industry'' as reasons it was ''forced'' on Monday to cut about 15 percent of its 2,000-person staff nationwide.  ''There have been a lot of comments made, negatively and publicly (about whether the executives needed planes),'' said Lori Johnson, marketing communications manager for Lincoln, Neb.-based Duncan Aviation.  She said financially troubled CitiBank also was accused of excess spending because it was taking possession of a new airplane. But she said private aircraft are needed and are a valuable business tool.  ''The majority of business airplanes are used to help mid-sized companies get to smaller airports where there is not commercial flight support,'' she said.  ''The sharp decline in flying by companies that own business aircraft combined with global business closings, reductions in spending and political grandstanding against our very livelihoods has created an environment that has left us no choice but to downsize,'' Duncan Chairman Todd Duncan said in a press release Tuesday.  Duncan has about 703 workers based at W.K. Kellogg Regional Airport in Battle Creek, including 25 at the Kalamazoo-Battle Creek International Airport. Some 122 of them lost their jobs Monday as part of the nationwide layoff of 304 workers.  CONTINUED 1   2 Next
