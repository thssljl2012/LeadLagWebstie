BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian college teacher Mercedes Diaz has little else in common with mattress maker Henry Moreno, but they both know the bitter sting of investment schemes that promise high returns only to collapse in scandal.  Latin America's poor and working class are more often the victims of get-rich-quick scams, but now some of the more well-heeled are feeling similar pain since U.S. bank Stanford crumbled under the weight of massive fraud charges.  The region's professionals and well-off pensioners were among the biggest investors with Stanford owner and billionaire, Allen Stanford, who was hit with accusations he fraudulently sold $8 billion in certificates of deposit from his Antigua operation.  From Mexico City to Quito, retirees sporting designer purses have waited with Blackberry-twiddling bankers to reclaim cash from Stanford, once seen as a guarantee of high returns or a safe haven offshore account in an often unstable region. 'We thought it was something solid, with a lot of years and tradition,' Colombian Diaz said recently lining up outside a Bogota university hall with other clients to transfer her cash from a local Stanford brokerage to another fund.  A U.S. lawyer for some Latin American investors says his clients want to keep their names confidential, fearing they could be targeted by criminals if word gets out about their wealth.  Lawyers and investors say wealthy Latin Americans also bet with Bernard Madoff, the Wall Street trader accused of masterminding a $50 billion Ponzi scheme stretching from Florida to Europe. He is expected to plead guilty this week.  Investors are still counting the cost of those schemes, but Latin America has a history of scams targeting the poor.
