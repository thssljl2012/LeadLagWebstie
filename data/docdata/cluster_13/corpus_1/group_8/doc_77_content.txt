ATHENS - A bomb exploded outside a Citibank branch north of Athens early on Monday, causing significant damage but no apparent injuries, Greek police said.  The bomb had been placed behind the bank in the suburb of Psychiko.  Two cars were also damaged in the blast, a police source said.  The 3:00 am (0100 GMT) explosion was triggered by wire, police said.  A month ago police defused a powerful car bomb outside the bank's Athens headquarters in the district of Kifissia, a few kilometres (miles) away from the branch targeted on Monday.  The bomb, consisting of two clocks, batteries and fertiliser-based explosives packed in five gas cylinders, was hidden in the car trunk and could have taken out the building had it detonated, police said.  No arrests were made over that attack but police suspect the involvement of Revolutionary Struggle, Greece's most dangerous far-left organisation that is best known for a rocket attack on the American embassy in 2007.  Banks in Greece are routinely targeted in arson attacks by suspected anarchist groups but the usual explosives of choice are petrol(gasoline)-filled bottles and weaker gas canister bombs. - AFP/vm
