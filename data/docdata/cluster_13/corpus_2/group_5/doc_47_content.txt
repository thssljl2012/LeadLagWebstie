For example, if the police identify a suspect, and prosecutors press charges, that case may be considered &amp;amp;quot;cleared,&amp;amp;quot; even if the suspect is never actually located and arrested.                      I didn&amp;#039;t mean to imply otherwise.  &amp;amp;quot;Clearance&amp;amp;quot; generally means that the police believe they have solved the crime in the sense that they have determined who the perp is, to the extent that they have stopped their effort to find out who dun it  and are now looking for their suspect or for prosecutorial evidence.  In practice, there is almost complete overlap with CBA.  If there is a known suspect for a homicide, it is a pretty high priority, and the number of suspects who have not yet been arrested is statisticxally insignificant.
