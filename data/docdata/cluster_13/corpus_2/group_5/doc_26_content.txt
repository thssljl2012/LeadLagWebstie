In response to the conspiracy theory that Bank of America magically caused Fitzgerald to indict Blago because of his appearance at the factory sit-in the day before: that is impossible.   This investigation started long, long ago and the events all predate 12/8/08- you are in never-neverland to think B of A could possibly have had anythign to do with this. Blago caused it!   Fitzgerald did the announcement when he did to stop Blago from actually pulling the trigger and appointing a Senator (for $500,000 or whatever) or appointing himself. Also, Blago got word the day before about a possible wire tap; sounds like the cover was blown.   Think about it: if Blago had a few more days and appointed, say, Jesse Jackson Jr., can you imagine the cloud that would hang over a Senator Jackson? What if Blago had appointed himself to the Senate?  I might add that Fitzgerald has prosecuted with little regard for the powerful. Fitzgerald is a Republican and he greatly embarrased the Bush administration in the Scooter Libby investigation. If he would go against his own party (and indirectly, his boss the president) why in the world do you think Bank of America- even if it had tried something- would have influence a US President wouldn't? What power does B of A have over Fitzgerald? All evidence is that if there is an honest person in this mess... it's Fitzgerald.
