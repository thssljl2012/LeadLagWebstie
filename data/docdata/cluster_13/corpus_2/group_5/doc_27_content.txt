Lesson to be learned: do not cross the puppetmasters of the world - the Bankers.     You are an i.d.i.o.t! Bank of America, in a 24 hour period, caused blago to be arested.  He has been under investigation for at least 3 years, if not more. The reason they acted yesterday was to limit any further damage blago could cause by appointing someone to the Senate.
