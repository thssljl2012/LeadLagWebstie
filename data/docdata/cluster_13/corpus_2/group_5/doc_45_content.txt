&amp;amp;gt; SQC will start operations into South America as from sunday.  &amp;amp;gt; BRUSSELS-RECIFE-VIRACOPOS-SANTIAGO-RECIFE-BRUSSELS   18.30 h Campinas    SQ7384   Scheduled 18.30 h    18.30 h Recife    SQ7384   Scheduled 18.30 h    18.30 h Santiago    SQ7384 Scheduled 18.30 h    18.30 h Sao Paulo    SQ7384 Scheduled 18.30 h   These are all Cargo B destinations!!!       Is this new SQC service perhaps just a temporary operation? Perhaps because of the grounding of OO-CBA and for as long as BB does not have a second aircraft available, SQC is called in adhoc to provide extra lift?  Or is SQC feeling the recession as well and are they now going at full force against small CargoB?        I remember that CargoB ended their Africa operations a while ago, after SQC had started operating JNB-NBO-BRU as well.  In the meantime those African SQC operations moved up to AMS reportedly.
