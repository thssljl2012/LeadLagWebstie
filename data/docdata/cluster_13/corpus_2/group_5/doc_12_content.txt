I am breaking my own rule here, but rules are being broken in Illinois - I read on truthout that the Governor there had ordered the state NOT to do business with Bank of America until the rights of the workers at the Republic factory were respected by the payment of their severance packages.  Then, on commondreams.org today is the Reuters bit that same Governor has been arrested on all sorts of charges compiled thanks to the unConstitutional wiretapping - don&amp;#039;t hear CNN upfronting on this, so it is up to us!  Not only the wiretapping entrapment but also  the US attorney who didn&amp;#039;t lower the boom on the Bushies after promising us he would is the one prosecuting here.        This smells to high heaven.  Bank of America is obviously TOO BIG TO EXIST!
