    WE JUST DONT CARE wrote:     &amp;amp;lt;quoted text&amp;amp;gt; &amp;#039;Gator&amp;#039;! What were you smoking when you posted something like this? &amp;amp;quot;At the height of the so-called Great Cultural Revolution, you could visit China without getting fined or jailed&amp;amp;quot;.     I think I had just burned the pizza again. Smoke from incinerated pepperoni will do that to you. Perhaps some clarification is in order, though. What I meant was, you could travel in China without being arrested when you got HOME,(we KNOW that much worse could have happened to you if you were stupid enough to tour China during the GCR), whereas China at the time was far more oppressive and brutal than Castro&amp;#039;s regime is today, and China represented far more of a threat to this country than Castro&amp;#039;s regime does. Just pointing out another aspect of the illogic of our long-standing Cuba policy.  Coda: since it&amp;#039;s sort of still newsworthy, all during the period of the GCR American businesses still legally traded with China at various levels. Case in point: Maurice &amp;amp;quot;Hank&amp;amp;quot; Greenberg, former unlamented president and chairman of the rapidly disintegrating insurance giant AIG - of multi billion dollar bailout fame - originally built the monster with Chinese money and continued doing business with Chinese banks and other interests right through the worst of the turmoil over there. In some ways he was the Armand Hammer of China, and no one was limiting him to &amp;amp;quot;humanitarian&amp;amp;quot; trade either. Just a case in point.
