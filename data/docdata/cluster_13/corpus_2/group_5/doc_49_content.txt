What WD Reinhart suggested earlier about infrastructure projects while the commodity prices are down. If they stay down great--I am in complete agreement.   Let us ask: what kind of infrastructure do we want for the 21st century? More highways for hydrocarbons? I was hoping for maglev rails! My dream project would be a combo maglev/water pipeline/Internet backbone running from Toronto to Mexico City. We need to make better relations with our Southern neighbors.   But truly, I feel the best investments would be to set up FAB labs across the country. Here is a link:  http://fab.cba.mit.edu/about/faq/
