I went to OpenDNS because I got sick of waiting for up to a 2 seconds for internode's DNS servers to return a lookup. I use Opera and you could see the pause on lookup in the status panel.   Once I went to OpenDNS the the speed is so fast I can't see the lookup in the Opera.   I don't care how fast the 'node servers are on test, perhaps I must go to unusual places, because for me internode's servers just don't have the address in it's cache whereas OpenDNS does. Maybe because the OpenDNS userbase is so much larger.   Also a little while ago, when I did the test, the internode DNS server was open for DNS poisioning (I wote a thread about this which was deleted). The OpenDNS people take steps to kill any poisioning attempts otherwise no-one would use their services.  So I prefer to use them for my banking as I feel that an aussie ISP is the most likely point of poisioning for the ANZ bank address.   OpenDNS are specialising in DNS whereas for internode DNS is just another service, probably better than many other ISPs but none the less wanting with easily observable pauses in common (for me) lookups.   This is my experience, your mileage may vary...
