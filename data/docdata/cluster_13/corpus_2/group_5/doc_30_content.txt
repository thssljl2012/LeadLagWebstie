BoA did; and now BoA is announcing massive layoffs.   That's not exactly accurate, Cars.  The factory in question was heavily in debt to Bank of America, and had signed a contract with the workers' union that had a very reasonable exit clause (two weeks' severence and unused vacation/sick pay, IIRC).  Instead, the owners closed the doors and filed chapter 13.  Bank of America, having acquired the assets of the now-defunct company, voluntarily stepped up and paid off the workers' contract.  The layoffs are unrelated and were in the works for a while.  Corporate layoffs don't just happen immediately when a company is losing money.  They have to research them to determine the right time, manner and personnel to lay off to maximize cost benefits without sacrficing too much productivity.
