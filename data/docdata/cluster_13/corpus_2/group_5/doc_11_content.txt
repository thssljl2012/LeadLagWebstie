 The company has orders that can be filled. There is also finished product in the building. This is not a simple situation. Also, getting a new line of credit, right now, is not easy, no matter what the state of the business is.     I saw an interview with a union official &amp;amp;amp; he stated that they also have issues with the company management. I got the impression from the interview that their goal is to make sure that the company stays intact with a goal of either an employee takeover or for the company to be acquired, thereby allowing them to keep their jobs. This is reasonable.     The company has been trying to work out a deal with Bank of America that would include following the federal law of 60 days notice. This is not a whoops on the part of Bank of America. They knew what they were doing &amp;amp;amp; they knew that this would put the company in violation of federal law, if they yanked the line of credit. They did not care, but they did miscalculate the reaction of the blue collar workers.      The company&amp;#039;s products are energy star compliant, so it would just make sense to attempt to keep a trained workforce making a product that is apparently viable, since they have unfilled orders.     There are good unions &amp;amp;amp; bad unions, &amp;amp;amp; within those unions there are good locals &amp;amp;amp; bad locals.
