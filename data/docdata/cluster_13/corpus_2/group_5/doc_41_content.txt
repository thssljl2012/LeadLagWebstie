      Even without explicit mention in the CBA, there could be evidence, such as notes or recollections that could be memorialized by those that participated in the CBA negotiations, that dependent care benefits were discussed in good faith even though the ultimate CBA did not require the ER to provide the CBU EEs with dependent care benefits.  If so, you can exclude those CBU EEs from the 55% test.    If dependent care benefits were not discussed in the CBA negotiations, or the ER refused to discuss those benefits or even consider providing them when the issue was raised by the CBU representatives, then I think you have to include those CBU EEs in your 55% testing.
