My good governor was in the process of selling the vacated US Senate seat to the highest bidder. The Justice Department didn&amp;#039;t want to see that happen.        Governor Blagojevich has been under wire-tap investigation for some time and the list is long on what they are charging him with.             Shh.  You&amp;#039;re going to spoil Cid&amp;#039;s tin-foil buzz.  What&amp;#039;s the deal, Cid?  Why have you become interested in politics again after you&amp;#039;ve decided that the methane bomb has gone off and it&amp;#039;s time to escape to the arctic circle?  Isn&amp;#039;t politics kind of petty once the biosphere is no longer capable of sustaining human life? _________________  http://doomsteaddiary.blogspot.com/
