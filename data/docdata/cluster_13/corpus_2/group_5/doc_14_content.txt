 Let&amp;#039;s talk about politics again!    Basically, the governor of Illinois has sole power to fill vacant Senate seats. Of which there currently is one. THIS Illinois governor decided that he damn well wasn&amp;#039;t filling that seat unless he got something out of it and fuck anyone who tries to shortchange him! (Including former occupant of the seat, but more on that below.) He also tried to extort the Chicago Tribune and Bank of America and probably all kinds of other things because he kinda sounds like a douchebag.    So enter everyone&amp;#039;s favorite prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, who  means business . He gets the FBI to wake up Blagojevich at 6am this morning and arrests him.      Smoking Gun  has the complaint. Here are some of the better quotes from today.         Quote:                     Originally Posted by Illinois governor               I&amp;#039;m going to keep this Senate option for me a real possibility, you know, and therefore I can drive a hard bargain. You hear what I&amp;#039;m saying. And if I don&amp;#039;t get what I want and I&amp;#039;m not satisfied with it, then I&amp;#039;ll just take the Senate seat myself.                 Quote:                     Originally Posted by the smoking gun               During a wiretapped November 10 call, a frustrated and financially strapped Blagojevich referred to Obama as a &amp;quot;motherfucker&amp;quot; and said that he would not appoint an ally of the President-elect to the Senate vacancy if &amp;quot;I don&amp;#039;t get anything.&amp;quot; Referring to Obama, Blagojevich exclaimed, &amp;quot;Fuck him. For nothing? Fuck him.&amp;quot; In a November 11 conversation, Blagojevich remarked that he knew Obama wanted Valerie Jarrett, a longtime confidante, to succeed him, &amp;quot;but they&amp;#039;re not willing to give me anything except appreciation. Fuck them.&amp;quot;                 Quote:                     Originally Posted by New York Times               In an earlier recorded conversation, prosecutors say, Mr. Blagojevich said he was approached by an associate of &amp;amp;#8220;Candidate 5&amp;amp;#8221; with an offer of $500,000 in exchange for the Senate seat.                 Quote:                     Originally Posted by New York Times               The governor, he said, was woken at 6 a.m. with a telephone call from the F.B.I., telling him that two agents were waiting outside with a warrant for his arrest, and that he should quietly open his door and let them in, to avoid waking his sleeping children. Mr. Blagojevich&amp;amp;#8217;s first response was, &amp;amp;#8220;Is this a joke?&amp;amp;#8221; Mr. Grant said.
