Something makes me wonder if this whole event was planned by TPTB to cause trouble among the tribes. George Mugabe Bush, President For Life? And, where is that miserable Cheney these days - in a cave in Afghanistan, plotting and planning? There is little that is done or said that even meets the most minimum standards of honesty and truthfulness. Today, we saw one &amp;quot;crook&amp;quot; bite the dust, and I thought, &amp;quot;Only 10,000 more to go!&amp;quot; Then, I go to Wayne Madsen&amp;#039;s site and find this: Today&amp;#039;s News, December 9, 2008 BREAKING: One day after Illinois Democratic Governor Rod Blagojevich ordered the state to stop doing business with the Bank of America over its role in closure of Chicago factory -- a move to support workers who have taken over factory -- U.S. Attorney for northern Illinois Patrick Fitzgerald, the man who let Karl Rove walk, has Blagojevich and his chief of staff arrested by FBI agents. Blagojevich accused of trying to &amp;quot;sell&amp;quot; Obama&amp;#039;s Senate seat. WMR has been one of the only media outlets that has reported on the prosecutorial misconduct of Fitzgerald in Illinois, Washington, DC and New York City. WMR reported that Fitzgerald had his indictement of Blagojevich prepared in October and was prepared to use it for a &amp;quot;mini-October Surprise.&amp;quot; http://www.waynemadsenreport.com/ But, none of this should concern you, the wee people. Just make sure you continue to SEND MONEY.
