There is no reason I can think of why a Governor should have the power to stop a State from doing business with a corporation based on political differences which is what the BofA fiasco with Blago was about, not that BofA broke a law, but that the Governor disagreed with the way they ran their business. Much like the Governor demanding that the Tribune fire some editorial writers they did not like politically in exchange for state money.  Blago is/was corrupt. Criminal charges were filed and he was arrested because of that corruption. Fitzgerald has stated that they were filed now because he did not want the voters of Illinois to find out in court years from now, or when he was indicted after he got out of office, that the Senator he had appointed had paid for the seat. He wanted people to have as much confidence in their Senator as possible. As corrupt as Illinois politics are, I suppose most of the politicians in this state feel more comfortable with the knowledge that Blago has been charged and arrested.

Lesson to be learned: do not cross the puppetmasters of the world - the Bankers.
