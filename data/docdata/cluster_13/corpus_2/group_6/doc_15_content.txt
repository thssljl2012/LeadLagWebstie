 Short and sweet - 3 amazing skyline shots        Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  jomaled                         Nice skyline, too bad I hear that the city's really hit hard financially, with banks going under and in trouble.  What's the downtown commercial vacancy rate nowadays, like 20%??                      Some experts think the vacancy rate may rise as high as 11% (not 20%), even with all the new office space opening within two year. The new Well Fargo 48 floor tower, the 30 floor 1 Bank of America, and the 15 floor Novare office building all under construction and scheduled to open within the next two years. There are rumors that Merell Lynch and GMAC may be moving major operations to Charlotte.
