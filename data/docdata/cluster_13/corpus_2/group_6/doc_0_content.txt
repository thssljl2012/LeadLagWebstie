One of the first acts of the American Revolution was caused when the former gov. came to seize the founders of the USs guns/weapons &amp;amp; that was a main reason why its a Right to own weapons &amp;amp; not a privilege in this country. One of the 1st acts Hitler &amp;amp; his Nazis did was to seize all the citizens weapons. Why of course every tyrannical gov declares weapon ownership by citizens illegal. Can anyone think of a more corrupt anti-American place then Bloombergs New York City? The home of Citibank, JP Morgan, AIG insurance &amp;amp; the rest that just looted 8.5 Trillion from American citizens a few weeks ago. When theres any doubt Id suggest you read up &amp;amp; study what the founders of the US wrote down on paper &amp;amp; left us as for a nation, evidently Anti-American Bloomberg hasnt!! The Right to Bare Arms isnt talking about wearing Short Sleeve Shirts folks!
