        QUOTE (shake zula &amp;#064; Mar 26 2006, 01&amp;#58;23 PM)       The North because things have stayed relativly the same. The North has more resources and money. So the South would be S-O-L.    I'm not sure what hole you've been hiding in the last thirty years, but in 30 minutes from my office I can drive by the headquarters of Bank of America, B B &amp;amp; T, IBM, US Air, former Wachovia, and many other fortune 500 companies, and that's Charlotte. Atlanta boasts even more. The colleges and universities in the south are among the nation's best, as to the &amp;quot;intelligence&amp;quot; comment earlier, and even in these trying times people are moving here from the north to find work. Fact is, the South has already won.
