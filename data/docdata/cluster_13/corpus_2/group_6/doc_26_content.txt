I have seen an update, specific to this area, in Obama's forthcoming stimulus package ... and it will help catapult the industry from the fringe ... to the mainstream.    Any specifics?      A significant, to scale, portion of the economic stimulus package with be towards energy efficiency and renewable projects that are "shovel ready".  The CleanTech industry, to some extent, already has a built up infrastructure to get to work from day one.    That is the emphasis of the stimulus package, beyond the partisan tax cuts (which are ridiculous), a reemphasis of demand side economics  .... away from the supply side.  A lot of people that are in this industry invest heavily in Vestas.  First Solar is another.  I would just pick up a munie that bucketed these stocks together.  I am in the heart of this industry ... and I can say that it is pure mayhem right now ... trying to deal with the growth, and projected growth.
