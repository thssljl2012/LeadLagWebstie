The North has more resources and money. So the South would be S-O-L.    I'm not sure what hole you've been hiding in the last thirty years, but in 30 minutes from my office I can drive by the headquarters of Bank of America, B B &amp;amp; T, IBM, US Air, former Wachovia, and many other fortune 500 companies, and that's Charlotte. Atlanta boasts even more. The colleges and universities in the south are among the nation's best, as to the &amp;quot;intelligence&amp;quot; comment earlier, and even in these trying times people are moving here from the north to find work. Fact is, the South has already won.      That's why this game is over before it starts. Despite it being outside your winder everyday,  I think that the &amp;quot;tried and true&amp;quot; Southerners have forgotten the extensive nature of the Northern 5th column that has infiltrated their ranks for the past 20 years.  You fine Southern gentlemen have browbeat them, called them insulting names like Yankee and have refused to even honor their kin as true Southerners...that's going to come back and burn you.
