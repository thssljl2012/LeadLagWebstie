Thus, we operate under Bank of America account and have a pending Federal Tax ID number. In addition, we are soon to apply for LLC. Also, I (myself) and physically here, in the United States (precisely in Seattle area, WA).      I believe that, by this, all your questions are answered. We have been doing business with people from Hong Kong, United States, the EU... There had never been any problems at all. Even if we were in Serbia, things would pretty much be the same.                      Could you please provide your fee schedule?
