Obviously, it didn't work for them, as a matter of fact, we first registered macedonia.eu. The matter went to the highest levels via  godaddy.com  and the main EU domain provider. We were the first ones to get it, but Athens got involved, pulled major strings (laughs: Greeks taxpayers money at work), and the EU domain folks decided to blacklist the domain, so now, no one has it. We thought they would blacklist macedoniaonline.eu as well, however, someone at the EU felt we should have it. Godaddy was stunned by the whole thing (Greek Govt. getting involved) and kept apologizing to us, even though we registered it fair and square. MINA: Tell us about Snowe and 'Pan Macedonia' with Yahoo and Google. I feel bad for the Greek lobby in the U.S. and Canada, and I feel even worse for the interns working in Snowe's office. Apparently, these people are not fans of ours because our content seems to create some kind of a breach in the way they are wired, so by fraudulent and deceiving means they thought they can pressure Yahoo and Google into removing us from their News Sources. That was their mistake no.1. Its not a good thing to try and manipulate the two grand masters of the internet. Their plan as usual, was to send emails from Snowes office, that way the email seems important, and will add additional pressure on Google &amp; Yahoo. MINA: And they seriously believed this would work? They must have. One, they have nothing better to do, it appears Snowes interns primary job is to send emails, make phone calls and pressure anyone and anything that says, supports Macedonia or Macedonian organizations in any way. Look at the UMD with the credit cards and the pressure put on the US Bank to cancel the credit card with the Macedonian sun! If I am not mistaken, that also came from Snowe's office. The sickening part is that Ms. Snowe is abusing her office. She was elected to serve Americans, however she is serving the Greek Government and works very closely with Greek lobby groups. Long story short, both Yahoo and Google investigated and sided with us 100%, especially upon discovering the history of manipulation and deceit by Greek radical lobby groups, particularly on the net, trying to remove Macedonian websites, retake Macedonian domains, and would do and say anything just to accomplish their goal. This is why all of our news articles (7 days worth) appeared at once everywhere, because we had that investigation period. Plans in the future? No plans, who makes plans these days?(laughs). We just like to thank both Google and Yahoo, true example for organizations and frankly institutions who not just wont allow to be manipulated and pressured by anyone, but would stick with you and support you 100%. We are hoping Google and Yahoo will block ip's of organizations who have attempted to manipulate them and wont be able to access Google and Yahoo. That'd be great. We have already started blocking of users who we feel they shouldn't have access here.     Hey Jew!! Can you imagine what will happen when Obama instead of Snow contacts google and yahoo to shut down FYROCLONES? Word on the street is that the Greek Lobby &amp; Mafia are talking to Barack! Darling...you definately have lote of time in your hands....but instead of spending it wisely...as most smart jews I know..you are full of hatred, very confrontational and like to spread hatred...enjoy your ride!
