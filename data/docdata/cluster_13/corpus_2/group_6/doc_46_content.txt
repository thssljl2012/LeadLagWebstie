This is also the same for ADL- CBA, especially on weekends, with a SYD or MEL transit costing a margin amount more. Whereas a BNE to MEL, or ADL to SYD seem to cost vastly more if transiting via SYD or MEL respectively.                      If you check the routing rules on QF fares, many of the routes (such as SYD-ME) the rule stipulates    TRAVEL MUST BE NONSTOP OR DIRECT.            which means that you cannot go via a 3rd point      On other routes domestically, there are specified valid routings      e.g. for TSV-BNE the rules state a routing of    TSV-BNE/SYD-PER       Dave
