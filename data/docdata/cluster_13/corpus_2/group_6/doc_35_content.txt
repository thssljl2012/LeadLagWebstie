           Advertisements [ ? ]                          Investors in the Warren Lichtenstein-managed Steel Partners say they have been the victims of a bait and switch in the reorganisation of the hedge fund.   Steel Partners has been a formidable name in the hedge fund world in recent years. However, the activist fund now finds itself in a precarious position.   AsianInvestor has seen a copy of a State of Delaware legal filing that on January 13, 2009 was filed by Bank of America in its role as the master trustee of ACF Master Trust. The defendants include Steel Partners and Warren Lichtenstein, who manages the fund.  The legal pleading makes for uncomfortable reading. Steel Partners lost 43% of its assets in the first 11 months of 2008. As a result, 38% of investors asked to redeem.   Warren Lichtenstein then wrote to investors on New Years Eve. Even though the fund had promised not to invest more than 25% in illiquids, the letter declared that its illiquid and in many cases control positions make it difficult and in some cases impossible to sell assets and businesses quickly.  The letter went on in a style described in the legal filing as, "part marketing gibberish and filled with what are meant to be motivational titbitsquoting a rhymeLife is full of stumbling blocks or stepping stones. It all depends on which you choose, one you win and one you lose.  So the investors found themselves well and truly on the other side of the looking glass. They were not getting their money back.  continued&gt;&gt;&gt;  http://www.asianinvestor.net/article.aspx?CIaNID=94540                         ...
