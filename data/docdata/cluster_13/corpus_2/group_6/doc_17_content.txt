Do you have references that can be checked out? How do you expect people to pay you? Also, when things come to setting up US based accounts and US based payment systems, how can you be of use?                      Mr. Kessel,    Even though my company is established in Serbia, our business capacity has at the moment been switched to the United States in total. Thus, we operate under Bank of America account and have a pending Federal Tax ID number. In addition, we are soon to apply for LLC. Also, I (myself) and physically here, in the United States (precisely in Seattle area, WA).    I believe that, by this, all your questions are answered. We have been doing business with people from Hong Kong, United States, the EU... There had never been any problems at all. Even if we were in Serbia, things would pretty much be the same.
