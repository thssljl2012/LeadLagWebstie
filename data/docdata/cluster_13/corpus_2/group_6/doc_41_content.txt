Conservatives to Bank of America's Columbia Cash Reserves' Money Market Fund "NSHXX" - Recently California state's unemployment rate is raised up to 9.3%. The Republicans and Conservatives are quite concern the alarm how the 2009-2010 "One-Party, One Voice" controlled by a single Democratic Party's US Congress &amp; Senate &amp; White House to run the United States.  In order to maintain a constant net asset value of US$1.00 per share for Columbia Cash Reserves' Money Market Fund "NSHXX", California Republican Party and the Conservates like to ask the Bank of America's Money Market Fund managers "NOT" to purchase any California's Sacramento's 8th District State Senator Leland Yee led California Municiple Securities/Bonds from the bankrupt state California starting February, 2009.  Consider Sacramento's 8th District state Senator Leland Yee is a liberal Democrat, wherever the labor-union on-strike take place, we can find state Senator Leland Yee is at there; the California Municiple Bond which Yee led is classified as R-Class (Risky-Class) during California is carrying billions dollar budget deficit.  Republican and Conservative individuals who DON'T vote for 8th District state Senator Leland Yee in San Francisco and San Mateo counties, we "DO NOT" want to include the Yee led California Municipal Securities/Bonds in our Columbia Cash Reserves' Money Market Fund "NSHXX"; otherwise the money market fund managers will get fired from Bank of America CEO by Republicans and Conservatives influences; any push-your-luck to purchase Leland Yee led California Municiple Securities/Bonds "MUST" be approved by the Columbia Cash Reserves' 1-share-1-vote by the individuals, otherwise the NSHXX will face lawsuit for sure.
