I'm certain the core GOOD workers (especially programmers and financial analysts) are searching  Monster.com  right now. You've got to retain your good workers- the price to replace them is much, much higher than a decent raise. Solid programmers/developers and financial analysts are in demand and have no worries finding a new job very quickly.     Not sure what planet you're living on or what you've been smoking. Citibank recently laid off 50,000 financial workers and every development job to be had is being sent to our friends in India.
