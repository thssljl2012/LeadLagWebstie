No, eminent domain is not necessary. While it may be true that buying one big building is easier than a bunch of smaller ones, it is not necessarily true in all cases.    We have seen how easy it is for large developers to amass smaller buildings to form one big plot:    1) Macklowe - the Drake/townhouses  2) Related (2) -  740 Eighth Ave.  and  440 W 42 St.   3) Boston Properties (Mort Zuckerman) -  250 W 55 St.   4) Durst/Bank of America - One Bryant Park  5) Extell (2) - Diamond Exchange tower and the Lucida    These are just a few examples that came to mind but there are many more.    You come up with a good price and most of those landlords will sell.    Vornado already owns several plots on the NE corner of 34 &amp;amp; Seventh (I believe, all the stores to the right of and including the Old Navy store as seen in the pic below).
