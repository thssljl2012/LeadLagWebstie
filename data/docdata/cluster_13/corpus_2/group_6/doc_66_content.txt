Down town to downtown for the entire board for the price of one day's interest on that status symbol and the club car does serve alcohol.         Perhaps if the government, by purchasing control of these companies instead of just giving them money, could sell these executive flying palaces and force the exec's to take a train. Then we might actually have coast to coast high speed passenger rail.                           I agree for travel in the NE area.  Citi is a global bank, however.  Anyone who travels frequently knows there is not an easy way to do it.  When our New York office comes here, they budget three days minimum.  Two for travel, one for actual work.  Not very productive.
