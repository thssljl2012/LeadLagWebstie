You have to remember, Vornado is a Realty Trust - their main business is acquiring and leasing out already existing properties, not building new ones. Thus, they haven't built too many skyscrapers in NYC because that's not their main business.                      Yeah, the Bloomberg tower and the PABT tower ranks right up there with the ESB and Chrysler in architectural significance. You can gauge the interest the Bloomberg tower has with skyscaper/development enthusiast here on this forum by seeing when the last time a post was made in that thread.    Lasting legacy...yeah right.         Quote:                         As of right now, yes, because they're not going to spend the money on acquiring an entire block full of buildings that they mostly do not own in order to build, in this economic climate. The Hotel Penn site is the most viable option for this tower. It also is the only space available in the area which would not require special permits to build a tower of this size.                     Umm...Earth to yankees12...they are working on a &amp;quot;special permit&amp;quot; otherwise known as a rezoning in order to build this. Did you not understand the reason why we're even discussing this right now in the first place?    Duh.             Quote:                         Not at all. The &amp;quot;somewhere else&amp;quot; options are dwindling, since the areas most viable for development are quickly being developed, and in this climate, developers aren't going to want to acquire huge amounts of land they don't currently own to build, or areas in which they need special permits from the city to build, especially when there is an area that a developer currently owns in full and does not need special permits sitting there available for redevelopment.                     Didn't people, including londonlawyer, Derek and myself just finished saying all the other sites right in that area that can be redeveloped?    Duh, again.             Quote:                         You missed the entire &amp;quot;architectural benefit&amp;quot; part, I can tell. None of those things would be architecturally beneficial to the city.                     You can't have it both ways. In one argument, you say that the original Waldorf-Astoria as great architecturally it might be was replaced by the ESB. Why can't Grand Central be replaced by something architecturally better?            Quote:                         And to completely ignore financial benefits by saying that demolishing any structure and building a tower on it would be financially beneficial is asinine. The reason anything in this city is built - whether it be Grand Central, the Chrysler Building, the ESB, or OBP, NYTT, 4TS, the new WTC, or this tower we're discussing right now, is because it will have financial benefits. Financial benefits are the motives behind every single piece of development in this city. If they were ignored, we'd be looking at an island that's barely changed since Henry Hudson first discovered it.                     You don't read well. I did not say to ignore financial benefit. I'm simply saying that if you're going to use that argument, then you have to apply it equally to every site or building as well, not just ones you find convenient to make your case.         Quote:                         I'm not saying financial benefits should overrule architectural benefits. But this is a case where we'd be getting a beautiful new skyscraper that would be a key component of the redevelopment of the Penn Station/Moynihan Station area, and would be far more beneficial financially to this city than the out-dated Hotel Penn is.                     Beautiful is only your claim. We don't know what the tower will look like. That rendering is just to give you an idea. By the time, it gets buillt, it will look nothing like it. Furthermore, that tower is nothing special.             Quote:                         Again, this had nothing to do with Robert Moses or anything like that. I'm supporting demolishing an average structure that no longer serves its main purpose that well in order to build a future landmark that would have a gigantic impact both on the skyline and on the area in which it is located, and bring millions of dollars and tons of office space into an area that can certainly use it right now.                     Your argument is inconsistent. You even admit this tower won't be built right now but then you say the area can use the dollars right now. Get your story straight first.         Quote:                         Once again, I ask - would you support tearing down the old Waldorf-Astoria in order to build the ESB? If you're going to make the giant leap that supporting the demolition of HP is akin to remodeling this city into Houston or is like Robert Moses, I think the comparison of tearing down a major hotel in favor of a massive supertall is valid.                     You keep on insisting that we're going to get an ESB equivalent here as if that was for certain. In all likelihood, we're not.    In this day and age, especially with the need to maximize floorspace, you're going to get at best something like a Bank of America and that is if you're lucky.    You're going to have an equal chance of getting a taller version of something this also:
