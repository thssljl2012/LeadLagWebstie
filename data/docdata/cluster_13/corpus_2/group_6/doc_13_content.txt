Go find yourself a good locally owned bank &amp;amp; move your stuff...     I refuse to deal with one of the large multinational banks..  never had any good luck with any of them....     Down here in Victoria we have First Victoria (FVNB has opened a couple of branches in the Houston area) &amp;amp; Trust Texas (Cuero) bot locally owned &amp;amp; you do get pretty good service from both.... Or Frost Bank out of San Antonio but they have a lot of branches in Houston...     Good Luck,     Supergas
