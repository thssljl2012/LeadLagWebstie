 This is what I came up. The output of the script is     ./CBA/IFS exist  ./CST/IFS exist  CST/IFS exist  CBA/IFS exist  CBA/subcba/IFS exist    I do not want any ./... folders, how do I solve the problem? Thanks!    cd ${collegedir}  find . -type d   while read file  do      college=&amp;amp;quot;$(basename $file)&amp;amp;quot;      if [ -f $college/IFS ]      then          echo &amp;amp;quot;$college/IFS exist&amp;amp;quot;  #       $homedir/scan.sh $collegedir/$college                                                                                           fi      for department in ${college}/*      do          if [ -d $department ]          then if [ -f &amp;amp;quot;$department/IFS&amp;amp;quot; ]               then echo &amp;amp;quot;$department/IFS exist&amp;amp;quot;               else echo &amp;amp;quot;Error! $department does not have an IFS file&amp;amp;quot;               fi          fi      done  done
