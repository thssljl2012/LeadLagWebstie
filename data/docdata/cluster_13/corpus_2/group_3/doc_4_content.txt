The diagram shows two triangles. The first one is labeled  ABC and the other one is called DEF. They both have a line going through them. On triangle ABC there is a line that starts at C and ends at line AB called M. On triangle there is a line thats starts at F and ends at line DE called N. The given is that triangle ABC and triangle DEF are congruent, M is the midpoint of AB and N is the midpoint of DE. Prove  triangle AMC is congruent to triangle DNF       Next there are two triangles that connect to each other that look like a bow tie but the bow tie is vertical. The triangle on top of the bow tie is labeled DCE and the bottom triangle is labeled AEB. There is a line that starts at line DC called F and and it goes through E and ends at line AB called G. That whole line is called FEG. The given is line AEC and DEB bisect each other, line FEG intersects line AB at G and line CD at F. Prove that E is the midpoint of line FEG      The next one is a rhombus that has been slip in half the rhombus is labeled on the top is called B, on the bottom is called D, on the left side is called A and the right side is called C. There is a line from B ending at D. Given line BC is congruent to BA and line BD bisects angle CBA. Prove line DB bisects angle CDA      Last one is a triangle that is labeled RPQ. This triangle has a little triangle inside of it labeled PSQ. In the bigger triangle there is a line starting at R and goes through S in the smaller triangle and ends at line PQ at T. Given RP is equal to RQ and SP equals SQ. Prove line RT is perpendicular to PQ       Please help I know its alot but please help
