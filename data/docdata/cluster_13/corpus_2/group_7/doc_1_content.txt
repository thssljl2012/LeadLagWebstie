      Hi all,  First off RIP to those that have not made it out.  It is sad to see what has unfolded in Vic.  I know there have been cruises organised but I thought posting places to donate now might help  EVERY BUNNINGS store is taking donations 100% of this will be forwarded to those in need.....                                 I work for Bunnings and can say all proceeds will hit the ground.  * Visit www.redcross.org.au * Phone 1800 811 700 * Any NAB, ANZ, Westpac or Commonwealth Bank branch * Any Bunnings store  * By direct deposit to the Victorian Bushfire Relief Fund - BSB 082-001, Account number 860-046-797  Myer Bushfire Appeal * All proceeds to the Salvation Army. Donate at any Victorian Myer store  I know there is a cruise coming but our "Mates" need help now!!!  Gavin
