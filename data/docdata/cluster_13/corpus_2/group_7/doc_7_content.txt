This isn't going to be popular but...maybe it is us that don't get their business.     Now more than ever it's essential for these companies to retain their top salespeople.   These type of events have always been a staple in the financial services sector and are very important in their recruiting and retention efforts.     It sends a sign about stability and solvency of the company to the biggest producers of their current team and also the top performers at other companies they are trying to lure.   Wells Fargo will definitely be mentioning  the success of their sales event when talking to all of the Bank of America employees who's book of business they are currently trying to recruit over.       I will agree that this event must be somewhat scaled down and streamlined from some of the lavish things that were done in the past.
