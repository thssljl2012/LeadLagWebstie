Corbett's office said that Countrywide, now a subsidiary of the Bank of America, misled many Pennsylvanians and encouraged them to take out loans they didn't understand or could afford.      http://www.denverpost.com/statehouse08/ci_11664539          The complaint against Countrywide alleged that it deceived borrowers by placing them in loans that had high risks of delinquency or default. The lawsuit alleged the lender used lax underwriting standards to give loans that borrowers soon found they could not repay as introductory rates expired and their mortgage payments skyrocketed.    "We're saying borrowers were victimized by loans that were in essence predatory," Suthers said         http://www.ocregister.com/articles/ameriquest-million-lee-2295093-new-company     Lee's payday is now the target of a federal lawsuit brought by a group of Ameriquest borrowers in Illinois. The suit argues Ameriquest paid Lee "  hush money  " to keep its predatory lending secret and to keep cash away from others with claims against the company.    New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo announced last week that he was   investigating John Thain  , the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch, who paid $4 billion in bonuses to executives for 2008, a year the company lost $15 billion. Thain gave the bonuses in December, before Merrill closed a deal to stave off insolvency by merging with Bank of America  which later received $45 billion in federal bailout funds.    Thain, who also came under fire for spending $1.2 million to redecorate his office  including spending $1,400 on a parchment trash can said he needed to pay the bonuses early to prevent an employee exodus. But Cuomo said he was concerned the bonuses came from taxpayers  part of the $45 billion Bank of America received from the $700 billion bailout fund.    "The fact that Merrill Lynch appears to have moved up the timetable to pay bonuses before its merger with Bank of America is troubling to say the least and warrants further investigation," Cuomo said in a statement.    In November, American International Group, the insurance giant which received $150 billion federal rescue package, decided to   forego executive raises and bonuses  for 2008 after Cuomo wrote to AIG's chief executive that: "We believe top executives should shoulder their fair share of these difficult economic times."    In October,   Countrywide Financial Corp. agreed to pay $8.68 billion  to settle a predatory lending investigation by California Attorney General Jerry Brown, the largest predatory lending settlement in U.S. history. But Brown said his investigators will continue to probe Countrywide's founder Angelo Mozilo and its former chief operating officer, David Sambol.    Sambol sold shares worth $64 million before Countrywide's collapse. Mozilo cashed out stock worth $478 million.    Also in October,   federal prosecutors in Washington State  invited tips from the public for their probe into fraud at Washington Mutual Inc., the nation's largest savings and loan until it collapsed in September. A shareholders' lawsuit sought to recoup $46 million from former chief executive Kerry Killinger, who allegedly enriched himself by pumping up WaMu's high-risk loans that ultimately undermined the bank. In December, a federal judge tossed out the suit, because creditors in bankruptcy court have first claim on the money.    A shareholders' class action lawsuit against New Century Financial Corp. demands the founders of the Irvine-based subprime lender return $58 million in stock, dividends and bonuses they collected before the company filed for bankruptcy liquidation in 2007.    New Century's founders  Ed Gotschall, who died in January, Brad Morrice and Robert Cole  have said they were as surprised as other investors by the collapse, noting they lost more money than they cashed out. They also said the stock they sold was part of a planned divestment. The lawsuit, however, says that Cole and Gotschall altered their plans several times in 2005 and 2006 to accelerate stock sales as the company's finances deteriorated         http://www.startribune.com/homes/38610527.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUUT         On Thursday, Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson filed lawsuits against two Florida companies that she said have ripped off troubled Minnesota homeowners.     Swanson alleged that IMC Financial Services and American Financial Corp., which is doing business as National Foreclosure Counseling Services (NFC), violated Minnesota law by charging upfront fees of as much as $1,850 to renegotiate mortgage terms and not doing so.    American Financial Corp. also has been sued by the attorneys general of Illinois and Colorado. In August, Swanson sued another mortgage foreclosure consulting firm based in Florida, as well as one based in New Jersey.     http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2009/01/ohio_attorney_general_sues_wes.html         -- The Ohio Attorney General's Office filed a lawsuit Tuesday against a Westlake-based mortgage broker it claims did not give clients adequate information about loans they applied for.      http://originatortimes.com/content/templates/standard.aspx?articleid=4162&amp;zoneid=1                 CLEVELAND, OH -A Cleveland-area mortgage broker failed to give consumers all the information they needed about their new loans, according to a lawsuit filed in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court by Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray. The suit charges Prime Option Financial Services, LLC (Prime Option) and Mark Belter, its leader, with several violations of consumer protection laws for allegedly failing to provide required information to consumers signing home mortgage loans.      This company failed to give consumers required documents about their mortgage loans, and in some cases, it gave them forms that were incomplete, said Attorney General Cordray. Under Ohio law, mortgage brokers are required to provide specific documents and information to consumers, so that they can make educated decisions about their loans.             http://abclocal.go.com/wjrt/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6641261      DETROIT (WJRT) --  (02/04/09)--The former Grand Blanc Township man accused of $20 million in mortgage fraud showed up in a Detroit courtroom Wednesday afternoon.     The pretrial hearing began with Kurt Heinz offering to take a plea deal, but the judge said no.     Several banks call it one of the largest mortgage schemes ever in Michigan.     http://www.fbi.gov/publications/financial/fcs_report052005/fcs_report052005.htm#d1         The increased reliance by both financial institutions and non-financial institution lenders on third-party brokers has created opportunities for organized fraud groups, particularly where mortgage industry professionals are involved.     Combating significant fraud in this area is a priority, because mortgage lending and the housing market have a significant overall effect on the nation's economy. All mortgage fraud programs were recently consolidated within the Financial Institution Fraud Unit, even where the targeted lender is not a financial institution. This consolidation provides a more effective and efficient management over mortgage fraud investigations, the ability to identify and respond more rapidly to emerging mortgage fraud problems, and a better picture of the overall mortgage fraud problem.     Each mortgage fraud scheme contains some type of "material misstatement, misrepresentation, or omission relied upon by an underwriter or lender to fund, purchase or insure a loan." The Mortgage Bankers Association projects $2.5 trillion in mortgage loans will be made during 2005. The FBI compiles data on mortgage fraud through Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) filed by federally-insured financial institutions, and Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Inspector General (HUD-OIG) reports. The FBI also receives complaints from the mortgage industry at large.             II. Significant Cases    REO FLIPWAGON (JACKSONVILLE): In December 2003, the FBI initiated an UCO to address the massive amount of mortgage fraud in the Jacksonville area. On September 16, 2004, as a result of this investigation, seven search warrants were executed and two arrests were made. Mortgage broker J. R. Parker and closing attorney Dale Beardsley, were arrested via complaint, charging them with bank fraud for their role in this alleged scheme.      OPERATION CLEAN DEED (CHARLOTTE): In November 2002, an FBI UCO was initiated utilizing a cooperating witness to introduce undercover FBI Agents into seven organizations involved in a multimillion-dollar mortgage fraud ring. Investigation led to the identification of fraudulent loans which exposed financial institutions and mortgage companies to potential losses of $130 million. On September 16, 2004, informations were filed in U.S. District Court, Western District of North Carolina, charging six individuals with bank fraud...
