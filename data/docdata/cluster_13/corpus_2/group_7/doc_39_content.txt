So you're saying that any future Big 3 "bailout" will stipulate the amount, type and content of advertising...     I work in advertising and I'll you that naming a stadium isn't proven to generate any more income for a stadium than conventional advertising. I'm not going to open a new CitiBank account because the Mets play at their stadium. In fact, I think more fans would be annoyed that their team's stadium is a corporate joke and would boycott that company.
