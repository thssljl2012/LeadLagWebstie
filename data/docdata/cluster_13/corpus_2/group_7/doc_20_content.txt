 FNM Message Board Posts          Recs: 1              How bad CRE can go in coming months/years? Here is a savoring deal just gone thru! This property previously sold for 100M in 2007, went into BK, asking price 65M , closing price 35m! BAC earting the crow!!!!        Costa Mesas South Coast Home Furnishings Center .        Newport Beach-based Burnham USA Equities Inc. last week closed on a court-overseen purchase of the 300,231-square-foot mall, for slightly more than   $35 million.        Its the biggest Orange County sale of a commercial propertyboth in terms of price and square footagein several months.      The center, which opened in 2006 near the peak of the housing market, was sold by developer Irvine-based Birtcher Development &amp; Investment Co.   in late 2007 for about $100 million.        The propertys prior owner, a Costa Mesa-based entity operating as South Coast Home Furnishings Center LLC, defaulted on an   $84 million loan to La Salle Bank Corp., part of Bank of America Corp  ., last August. It was one of the first big local commercial properties to default on a loan because of the deteriorating economy.      The property was put into court-ordered receivership the following month. The court   initially aimed for a $65 million   sale, but dropped its price once offers didnt come close to that value.
