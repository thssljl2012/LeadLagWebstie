Europe ambushes Germany on debt bail-out         The European Union has called an emergency summit of national leaders this  month to halt the drift towards protectionism and stem the risks of a debt  crisis as the slump deepens.                          By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard   Last Updated: 6:24PM GMT 09 Feb 2009               EU finance ministers are to discuss proposals over breakfast in Brussels today  for some form of "debt-agency" or mechanism for the EU to raise  bonds, a move seen by diplomats as a ploy to ambush Germany into accepting  shared responsibility for EU debts  anathema to Berlin.        Concern is mounting over the dramatic deterioration of public finances across  the EU. Ireland's deficit is heading for 12pc of GDP, and there are doubts  over whether Italy and Greece can roll over some 250bn (218bn) in state  debt between them this year.        EU company debt is a worry too, now 95pc of GDP compared to 50pc in the US. "The  amount of debt to roll over in the eurozone is huge, at a time when banks  are tightening credit standards," said Gilles Moec, from Bank of  America. "Spanish businesses are in a dire situation."        Mirek Topolanek, Czech premier and holder of the EU presidency, said the  crisis summit was aimed at thrashing out a joint "recovery plan"  and curbing the nationalist reflexes that are tearing the EU apart.        The Czechs are livid over comments by French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who  threatened to withold aide for French car companies unless they spend it at  home. " If we give money to the auto industry to restructure, we don't  want to hear about plant moving to the Czech Republic," he said.        Mr Topolanek said the comments were "unbelievable" and could cause  the Czech Republic to reject the Lisbon Treaty. "If somebody wanted to  seriously threaten ratification, they couldn't have picked a better means,"  he said.        The French plan fleshed out yesterday offers 6.5bn in soft loans to Renault  and PSA Peugeot Citroen on condition that they promise not to close any  sites in France. The Brussels competition police said they will examine the  details to determine whether the terms breach EU law.
