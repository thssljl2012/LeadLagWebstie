All of the parking lots keep the area an odd mix of tall buildings with large expanses between them.                      In most cases, that's what I mean by neighborhoods that got plowed under by redevelopment: buildings that were knocked down.   I found an interesting book on the subject:   The Ohio State University Press      I'm very interested in the history of urban planning, and this book looks like some intriguing reading. From the bit I have skimmed it seems like Columbus had similarities with Sacramento: it also had a period of expansion, absorbing unincorporated land, and there were nonwhite neighborhoods downtown that were destroyed in the path of things like freeways and urban renewal projects. There doesn't appear to have been a massive urban-renewal project on the scale of Sacramento's redevelopment era, which may be why its urban center recovered more quickly: it was less thoroughly destroyed than ours. Generally, parking lots in old cities is a sign of where old buildings and old neighborhoods used to be.

In Ohio and Virginia, where I lived the 25 years before moving to Sacramento, this wasn't a problem at all. It would be interesting to compare the development philosophies of Fairfax County (VA), Franklin County (OH) and Sacramento County over the past 40 years.                     Indeed it would. I tend to focus a lot on Sacramento and getting more views of how other cities faced redevelopment would be very interesting.           Quote:                         Another thing occurred to me concerning significant differences between Columbus and Sacramento. In Columbus you have some headquarters of Fortune 500 companies, and they make a huge difference in development discussions. For example, about a dozen year's ago, Columbus had similar problems as Sacramento today with the need for a newer and larger arena. In Columbus, Nationwide Insurance took the lead, and developed a great new arena. In addition, they made the arena the centerpiece of a massive downtown muti-purpose development, similar in many ways to the Railyards problem Sacramento is trying to fix today:      Nationwide Arena       Arena District       Arena District   Columbus, Ohio   Sports, Dining, &amp; Entertainment                      That's kind of the problem: people who start businesses and do well in Sacramento tend to move away once they get rich. We have state government, which tends to be a rather more conservative institution than private industry. Government agencies normally aren't interested in things like putting their name on an arena.
