Burger King Costs Taxpayers Estimated $273 Million A Year " The report finds that one of Goldman Sachs' major investments, Burger King, costs taxpayers more than a quarter billion dollars a year as Burger King employees are forced to rely on public health and income support programs as a result of the lack of affordable employer health coverage and sub-poverty wage levels at Burger King." "A previous SEIU report on another bailout recipient, Bank of America, found similar evidence of employment costs being shifted to taxpayers -- up to $50 million a year because Bank of America workers lack affordable employer health benefits."
