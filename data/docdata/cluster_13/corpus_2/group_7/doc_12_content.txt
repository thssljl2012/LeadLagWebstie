   Perhaps I should make some type of fantasy league or office pool of companies that will fail this year.    Here is US News and World Report's list:    - Rite-Aide    - Claire's    - Chrysler    - Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group    - Realogy Corp    - Station Casinos    - Loehmann's Capital Corp    - Sbarro    - Six Flags    - Blockbuster    - Krispy Kreme    - Landry's Restaurant    - Sirius Satellite (NO!, I need Mad Dog every afternoon)    - Trump Entertainment Resort Holdings (When I was in Vegas I heard that the Trump Condos were leasing rooms out to the locals at $100/night because there was too much vacancy).    - Bearing Point.     http://www.usnews.com/blogs/flowchart/2009/02/06/15-companies-that-might-not-survive-2009.html     Any others?    United Airlines?    Bank of America?    The Dollar?
