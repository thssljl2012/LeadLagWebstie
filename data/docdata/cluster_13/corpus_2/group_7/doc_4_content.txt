The banks here in Charlotte are taking a hit no doubt, but "evaporated"? That's taking it a bit far. Wells Fargo, after acquiring Wachovia, will still have large numbers of people employed here, Bank of America is still an independent company, and word on the street is that Morgan Stanley's retail banking operations and GMAC are looking to be headquartered in Charlotte. Charlotte still has enough appeal that people will still want to relocate here.      Furthermore, the Carolinas are MUCH more than Charlotte. Raleigh, Greenville, Winston-Salem, Charleston, Greensboro, Columbia, etc. have relatively stable economies and are poised for more economic growth once this current nightmare is over (whenever that will be).
