And here, some trite about this years Citibank bonuses, "a doormans tip"   http://siliconinvestor.advfn.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=25373292  ------------------------------------------------------ * The AFL-CIO Total is calculated as originally proposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its initial 2006 rule making on executive compensation disclosure. On Dec. 22, 2006, the SEC amended the disclosure rules for stock options and other equity awards. Under this change, companies are required only to include the value of equity awards that vest during the fiscal year instead of the full value that are granted to executives. The SEC Total follows the approach used by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in determining the amount of options to be expensed in a company's financial statements. In order to show the full value of equity awards granted to executives, the AFL-CIO Total includes the Grant Date Fair Value of Stock and Options Awards as found in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table of the company's proxy statement. The AFL-CIO believes this total calculation better represents the full value of compensation awarded to executives as decided by the board of directors during the fiscal year in question. The AFL-CIO Total follows the method the SEC has historically used in disclosing options granted to executives.    ** Data courtesy of AFL-CIO, Americas Union Movement
