  I take that back! The only thing that is not working is my substitution.  Here it is:  &amp;amp;nbsp;s/\.com:.*$/\.com/g;  What I want to do is chop off everything after .com in my file so:  csrna-cba.private.massmutual.com:CSRNA-CBA 3/19 to CSDN6-TSA g2/1 csrna-cba.private.massmutual.com:L3 DWDM CSRNA-CBA 1/25-28,2/25-2  becomes:  csrna-cba.private.massmutual.com csrna-cba.private.massmutual.com   If at first you don&amp;#039;t succeed, don&amp;#039;t try skydiving.
