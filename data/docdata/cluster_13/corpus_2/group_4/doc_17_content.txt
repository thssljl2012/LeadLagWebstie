  Hi all,    I have an extremely simple macro as follows:    Private Sub Application_ItemSend(ByVal Item As Object, Cancel As Boolean)  If Item.Class &amp;amp;gt; olMail Then Exit Sub  Item.Body = Replace(Item.Body, &amp;quot;My N ame&amp;quot; &amp;amp; vbCrLf, &amp;quot;My Name, CISA&amp;quot; &amp;amp; vbCrLf)  End Sub    However: when it executes it changes the MESSAGE PARAGRAPH FONT and  CHARACTER Size from what I have it set as (Verdana 10) to Calibri 12.    This shouldn&amp;#039;t happen!    Can anyone help please...    Many thanks in advance,  Sean
