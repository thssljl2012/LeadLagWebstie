Can you show me the data with before/after ?                      Jindon here is an example of what the data looks like before and what the final outcome should be.      Process: Insert 2 columns two the right of Col H, and then in Col I put heading ledger and in Column J put heading Statement, then the macro needs to look in Col F which is the descriptions and if there are 2 codes which are the same then the Ledger and Statement go on one line, the example makes it cleared. When all done delete rows which have blank cells in Col J and K then delete Col G (Units). You should end up with the last screen shot.     Is this ok?
