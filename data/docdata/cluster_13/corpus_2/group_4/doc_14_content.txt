 Hi!      I&amp;#039;m trying to use a global note together with custom special buttons strings, however whatever I try, all I get is with CONE 14 panic. I haven&amp;#039;t yet tried with the phone, the problem appears with S60 3rd MR simulator.      I create the CAknGlobalNote instance this way:        Code:     iNote = CAknGlobalNote::NewL();  iNote-&amp;amp;gt;SetTone(EAknNoteDialogNoTone);  iNote-&amp;amp;gt;SetSoftkeys(R_NEW_CONTENT_POPUP_BUTTONS);    If I replace R_NEW_CONTENT_POPUP_BUTTONS with any of  R_AVKON_SOFTKEYS_... resource, everything works as expected. My resource is defined like this:           Code:     RESOURCE CBA r_new_content_popup_buttons  {   buttons = {    AVKON_CBA_BUTTON {      id = EAknSoftkeyOk;       txt = S_NEW_CONTENT_POPUP_SHOW;    },    AVKON_CBA_BUTTON {      id = EAknSoftkeyCancel;       txt = S_NEW_CONTENT_POPUP_CANCEL;    }   };  }    What makes the whole thing more interesting is the fact, that the following piece of code seems to load my resource perfectly. I&amp;#039;ve tried to look at the memory dump at &amp;#039;a&amp;#039;, and it looks perfectly valid (I&amp;#039;ve compared to R_AVKON_SOFTKEYS_... that work fine)!        Code:     TResourceReader reader;  CCoeEnv::Static()-&amp;amp;gt;CreateResourceReaderLC(reader, R_NEW_CONTENT_POPUP_BUTTONS);  void *a = const_cast&amp;amp;lt;void*&amp;amp;gt;(reader.Ptr());  CleanupStack::PopAndDestroy();    1. Any idea what am I doing wrong?      2. Are the &amp;amp;quot;avkon global note&amp;amp;quot; objects the only way to display a dialog regardless of what application is in the foreground? Is it possible to display a generic form or dialog in a &amp;amp;quot;global&amp;amp;quot; mode?      BR,   Przemek
