 I&amp;#039;ve got the solution but it is rather difficult. The &amp;#039;Menu&amp;#039; you want is not a real menu, but a window-owning control. The CEikMenuBar is also a control, but it&amp;#039;s behaviour cannot be changed. So the only way is to write a menu control yourself. Otherwise, you have to change your design, as it is maybe not necessary.      ------------------------------   SAKON - to make s60 ui developing easier!       With S60  you have to write 10 lines to implement a custom dialog/view. But with sakon, you just have to write 1 line. Sakon also provides helpful stock control for you, such as choice list, checkbox, building block, slider. Sakon is automatically skinned backgroud, and you&amp;#039;ll never worry about your transparent dialog. You also able to create multi-page views and dialog. Sakon is very independant. All of the controls and containers are derived from CCoeControl. It will improve efficiency. Just try it now.    Official WebSite:  http://www.afasoft.cn
