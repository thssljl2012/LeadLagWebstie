Why do few other countries have the problem the Swiss do in determining that the money was acquired illegally? If I try to deposit several million dollars in a US bank (even in Delaware) I'm going to have to prove it is from a legitimate source.     Why is this so difficult for the Swiss?     Answer: It's not. The Swiss have simply decided that the profits to be made by laundering Arafat's money were more important than the suffering of the Palestinian people. And they feel the same for other dictators as well.
