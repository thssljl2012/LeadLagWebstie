        NY lawyer charged with misdemeanor after leaving her bickering daughters on the side of the road    By  Carrie Melago    DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER    Updated Wednesday, April 22nd 2009, 7:41 AM                AP        Madlyn Primoff of Scarsdale, New York, a lawyer at a tony Park Ave. firm, left her daughters on the roadside and drove off     after they wouldn't stop fighting. She was charged with a misdemeanor.                                 Mommy fearest                           Did a Westchester mom cross the line when she left her bickering daughters on the side of the road?                                                                 Yes - Parents might all think about             it, but actually doing it is another matter.                   No - I'm sure her girls learned             a good lesson.                   Not sure - I hope it was a very safe             neighborhood!                                                                                     A prominent Park Avenue lawyer was arrested after cops said she got so angry at her young daughters that she kicked them out of her car - and drove off.     Madlyn Primoff  apparently couldn't bear any more squabbling between her 10- and 12-year-old daughters Sunday and booted them out of the car in  White Plains ,  Westchester  County, authorities said. The fedup Scarsdale mom - a partner at white-shoe firm  Kaye Scholer  - soon relented and let her 12-year-old daughter back in when she caught up with the family car.   The younger daughter wandered around the corner to  Mamaroneck  Ave., where a good Samaritan spotted her in @*$+@ about 7:30 p.m., bought her ice cream and then approached a cop in a patrol car.    The officer described the girl as "very upset" and "emotional" in the police report.    Primoff reported the girl missing to Scarsdale police, who contacted White Plains cops and were told the girl was out of harm's way.    The 45-year-old mom was arrested when the family arrived at headquarters to pick up the child.    The district attorney's office said she was arraigned Tuesday on one count of endangering the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor, and released on minimal bail.    Primoff is a partner in the Business Reorganization and Creditors' Rights Practice Group at the firm and has clients such as  Bank of America ,  Merrill Lynch  and  Wells Fargo , the firm's Web site said.     Barry Willner , managing partner of Kaye Scholer, said in a statement, "Madlyn Primoff is a very well-respected partner at our firm, and we consider this matter to be personal and private."    Actress Tawny Kitaen, who answered the phone at Primoff's, home declined to comment.
