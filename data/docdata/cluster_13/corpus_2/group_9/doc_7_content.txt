French Bank Needs a New U.S. HQ        By Dana Rubinstein   March 31, 2009      Socit Gnrale has hired CB Richard Ellis to scout for new space, thanks to the impending expiration of its 1221 Avenue of the Americas lease in 2013, according to sources.      Sadly, neither CB Richard Ellis nor the French banking giant would comment for this story. But  one source told us the bank is looking for something like 500,000 feet , which would make it one of the bigger kids on a leasing block                        Doesn't mean these are tenants that would move to the WTC site, but the market isn't completely dead, even today.       http://www.observer.com/2009/real-es...nancial-center         Huge, Credit-Worthy Tenant Deloitte Thickens the Plot at World Financial Center        By Dana Rubinstein   April 20, 2009      The plot has thickened at Brookfield Properties' World Financial Center, a mammoth office complex that's been the source of endless speculation since Bank of America bought its primary tenant, Merrill Lynch, during the bank consolidations of yesteryear.      Now, new complications!    Deloitte -- the enormous accounting firm with headquarters at Two World Financial Center--has issued a request for proposals to landlords across the city in search of between 600,000 and 800,000 square feet of office space, according to industry sources.      Deloitte's reps at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, John Cefaly and Dale Schlather, wouldn't comment for this story, but insiders tell The Observer that the landlords of both 11 Times Square and the future 4 World Trade Center have received the request for proposal.         Lord knows, Deloitte, whose lease isn't up for a while yet, has ample opportunities. The suffering and/or demise of the commercial real estate's three pillars -- finance, law and media/advertising -- have left the market with a surfeit of lovely office space and a paucity of tenants. Aside from the two aforementioned buildings, the old New York Times building at 229 West 43rd Street, and Merrill's current 4.2 million square feet at World Financial Center could also accommodate the tenant.       Stay tuned. The Observer will have more on this in Wednesday's print edition.
