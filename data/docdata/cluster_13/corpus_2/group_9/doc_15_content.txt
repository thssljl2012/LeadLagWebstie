      Seeham lost his cash cow with the McCormick Group who controls AMFA when NW went out on strike, he has to replace that money.  He also lost the PFAA which was also controlled by the McCormick Group when NWA's FAs voted them out.  He also lost a landmark case when representing AMFA at ACA, he lost the case that a company has to remain status quo during a first CBA negotiation, where before that case every company  had to remain status quo until Seeham entered the pic and lost the case badly for AMFA.  He also represented EL AL and I think Alitalia when they locked out US based employees.  I guess USAPA did not research his background.
