  Madlyn Gleich Primoff, 45,  of 36 Olmstead Road, Scarsdale, NY did what just about every parent has threatened to do at one point or another - she ordered her two warring daughters out of the car and  drove off leaving them behind.  She was charged with   endangering the welfare of a child  , a misdemeanor and   released on minimal bail.         Madlyn Primoff is a prominent Park Avenue lawyer   , a partner at the law firm of  Kaye Scholer LLP  located at 425 Park Avenue New York, NY. Her expertise is in  Bankruptcy &amp; Creditor/Debtor Rights.    She works        in the Business Reorganization and Creditors' Rights Practice Group    and has clients such as   Bank of America, Merrill Lynch and Wells Fargo  , according to the firm's website. She lives with her husband and daughters in a  $2 million home  in an upscale neighborhood. She is not the type of person one would expect to abandon her kids -   but she did!       According to police , Sunday evening (4/19/09)    Madlyn was travelling through downtown White Plains    with her  two daughters aged 10 and 12  when she could no longer take the bickering coming from the two quarrelling siblings. She stopped the car at the intersection of  Post Road and South Broadway  and ordered both of them to get out of the car.   She then drove off leaving the two girls behind.     The 12-year-old , after realizing that her mom intended to leave them there,   ran after the car  , caught up to it and was allowed to get in. Madlyn then drove off   leaving the 10-year-old behind.          A stranger found the little girl wandering on nearby Mamaroneck Ave, bought her some ice cream and called the White Plains police. The little girl was able to give the police her mother's name and address.    Shortly afterward Scarsdale police notified the police in White Plains that the mother had just called to report the 10-year-old as missing. The White Plains police told them that the girl was safe and sound and in their custody at police headquarters.    Madlyn, accompanied by her husband and other daughter, showed up at headquarters later that evening. She was   immediately arrested   and a temporary order of protection was issued, barring her from contact with the girls. The District Attorney's office said she was arraigned Tuesday on one count of endangering the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor, and released on minimal bail.
