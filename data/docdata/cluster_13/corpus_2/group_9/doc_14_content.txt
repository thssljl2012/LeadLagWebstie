Well, there might be something said for a paper that posts a different well endowed bare chested female on the inside of the last page every day.  I think it was the Daily Mail.  But that was 1984.  I'm sure American puritanism/feminism has some how found its way into the British Isle's.  However, I have full faith and confidence that if it has, it is a singularly unique expression, and maintains the British tradition of humor in the face of adversity.  On the other hand, I found British reporting of American politics much more balanced and pragmatic in its approach.  Of course it was from the perspective of the impact upon the UK.  As far as reporting on British politics.  It paled in comparison to a session in the House of Commons.  Too bad you joined the EU :-).
