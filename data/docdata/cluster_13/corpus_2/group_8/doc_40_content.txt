        QUOTE (BoeingBoy &#064; Mar 4 2009, 05:19 PM)       The  transition  process is complete when the single contract is ratified.  There were three separate and independent steps that had to be accomplished before integrated operations could be conducted.    1 - Single ops certificate 2 - Single seniority list 3 - Single contract  It mattered not which was completed first or the order of completion, as long as all were completed.  It could have been seniority first, ops cert second, contract third, or any other order.  As of today, two of the three steps have been completed - SOC and seniority list.  The question before the court is whether or not the majority can circumvent the completed seniority integration by changing CBA's without that CBA being in violation of it's DFR responsibilities.  Jim     Finally, something we agree on. Yep, and with it's NMB sanctioned election including ALL...ALL...ALL LCC pilots, USAPA won the election. And since the west likes to claim that they were outnumbered in this election, it'd be interesting to show the actual numbers' that revealed it was not a full "east-west"" outnumbered vote. Indeed, not all east pilots voted for USAPA, and that can be proved. So then, with the future union truly "up in the air"...USAPA won. And they are entitled to create CBL's accordingly. That the west pilots NEVER participated from the very beginning will drastically impact their DFR case...they were invited: they just didn't like the terms, or the idea...  I don't like OBAMA....doesn't change a thing, does it.
