         If you recall before Walden was named as "Customer Officer", SHC announced a plan to beef up the troops in the E-division over at Sears Tower. Well, did Eddie get a good lease contract for that to happen? Seems that there is no mention of significant SHC presence in this refinancing deal:     Commercial Property News                  Quote:              Chicago's Sears Tower Closes $780M Refinance         Chicagos iconic Sears Tower has been refinanced for $780 million with a ten-year, fixed rate mortgage. The loan was arranged by the Carlton Group. This major loan and $1.2 billion valuation comes on the heels of  major lease renewals  at the building by law firm Schiff Hardin &amp; Waite and Bank of America for approximately 180,000 square feet, and law firm Latham &amp; Watkins for more than 120,000 square feet. Law firm Segal McCambridge recently signed a new 60,000-square-foot-lease, and long-time anchor tenant Ernst &amp; Young, which already leases over 300,000 square feet, recently expanded its presence in the building.            Funny that SHC, whose name is all over this building, isn't even mentioned in passing. Maybe those positions will have to move to The Estate if Eddie didn't get a good lease deal with this turn of events.
