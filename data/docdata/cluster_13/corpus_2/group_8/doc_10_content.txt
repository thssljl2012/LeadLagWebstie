I think your best bet would be to talk to one of the "retail" banks like Bank of America, not the wholesale or trust banks like Northern, Morgan, etc.  I don't know their minimums, but I'd be quite sure B of A would be lower than most in NYC.  Also, the suggestion of speaking to the charity is a good one.  I know of a hospital that handles estates for their benefactors.          When I was in the business I usually knew of competitors that would accept business which we weren't interested in handling.  Speak to one or two trust officers and they should be able to steer you in the right direction.    John             Thanks.  I have a feeling Bank of America will direct me to their U.S. Trust subsidiary, which probably has a very high minimum.         http://www.bankofamerica.com/ustrust/
