Letter from the Sultan of Sulu &amp; Sabah - a small, gas-rich sultanate located next to Brunei on Borneo.  The letter identifies a gold bullion account held by Westpac Bank, Melbourne, under the reference code "Republic of the Philippines."  Note that the amount of gold involved was 30,000 metric tonnes.  In fact this is only about a third of the gold bullion held by Westpac, according to other papers in this author's possession.  It is not hard to conclude that the Sultan was acting as trustee on behalf of others.                      http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/so...part%203.2.htm
