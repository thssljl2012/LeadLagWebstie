        QUOTE (Piedmont1984 &#064; Mar 4 2009, 03:37 PM)       Your comment "with that came all the prior commitments", seems to me the central question. I would argue that this particular "committment" was deemd so unacceptable by the rank and file that they removed the previous CBA before the committment was fully implemented. The process was interrupted. The committment was not fully consumated. IOW, there was no committment.     Here is where I differ.  Based on what I know as an outsider, it appears to me that the process was not really interrupted.  It continued through binding arbitration and an award was made.  Has the process not gotten to an award being made in a binding arbitration I would agree with what you wrote, specifically that the process was interrupted.   Here is an analogy that describes how I view what seems to have happened.  Someone makes an offer on a house that is accepted.  That person meets all their contractual obligations and goes to closing to sign all the documents and does so.  After the closing the lender has cold feet and stops payment on the closing checks.  The party buying the house signed the papers but the party selling never got their funds.  Who is the owner of the house?  Who has the rights to the house?  (This is just an illustration and not a fact pattern likely to happen.  It is a fast illustration only.)
