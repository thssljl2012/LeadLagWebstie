      This argument that the Nic was the sole reason for USAPA's existence is another misconception. That USAPA is simply a pretense for circumventing the Nic. If the Nic prevails in court, USAPA will continue as the duly elected CBA quite well thank you.  There was a great deal of anti ALPA sentiment in the wake of our pension loss and LOA93. And I'm not convinced that ALPA would be gone if Doug Parker had simply given the east pilots parity from day one.   Remember, had 200 pilots voted the other way, John Prater would still be sending us updates.  The Nic was the last nail in ALPA's coffin.
