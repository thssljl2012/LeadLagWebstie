 BAK Message Board Posts          Recs: 1              AIG - a criminal organization    http://www.delawarelitigation.com/uploads/file/int8B.PDF       Chancellor Leo Strine has some choice words for the "inner circle" of AIG management -- Maurice Greenberg, Edward Matthews, Thomas Tizzio, and Howard Smith.  He goes on dismiss the Shareholders complaint against AIG employees and PwC the auditor, but denies the the motion to dismiss the claims against AIG's inner circle.  The complaints aren't even regarding AIGFP - they mostly stem from municipal insurance fraud, GenRe fraud, and general insurance fraud against the shareholders of AIG.  This is a stinking carcass.      "But here?  Really?  The Complaint fairly supports the assertion that AIGs Inner    Circle led a  and I use this term with knowledge of its strength  criminal    organization.  The diversity, pervasiveness, and materiality of the alleged financial    wrongdoing at AIG is extraordinary.  The proposition that Matthews and Tizzio, who the    Complaint fairly alleges were directly knowledgeable of and involved in much of the    wrongdoing, did not also know that AIGs internal controls were inadequate and too    easily bypassed is not, for present purposes, an interpretation to ground a Rule 12(b)(6)    dismissal order on.  Indeed, for present purposes, it is inferable that even when Matthews    and Tizzio were not directly complicitous in the wrongful schemes, they were aware of    he schemes and knowingly failed to stop them.  In that regard, I find it inferable that    Matthews and Tizzio were aware of misconduct that should have been brought to the    attention of AIGs independent directors (including the Audit Committee) but chose to    conceal their knowledge, despite having a fiduciary duty to speak."
