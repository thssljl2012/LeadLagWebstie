 AIM Report     By Cliff Kincaid     March 1, 2009    Elite members of the World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, at the end of January were considering a proposal for a new global television network to usher in a state of global governance. It sounds authoritarian, even totalitarian, to some.   The media proposal, which was included in The Global Agenda 2009 report, is to create a new global network with the capacity to connect the world, bridging cultures and peoples, and telling us who we are and what we mean to each other. Several prominent U.S. media figures signed on to the alarming and controversial proposal.   Isnt it nice that we might have a TV network telling us who we are? And what we mean to each other? Perhaps we will learn that we are global citizens. Perhaps a global leader of some sort will tell us that. Who might that be?   This outlandish and frightening proposal doesnt come from a fringe organization. The WEF is an exclusive club of very rich and powerful people from around the world. It describes itself as an independent international organization committed to improving the state of the world by engaging leaders in partnerships to shape global, regional and industry agendas.   This years conference featured speeches by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. The events corporate sponsors, which pay about half a million dollars each to participate, include several failing institutions that have received tens of billions of dollars from U.S. taxpayers. They include Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., and Morgan Stanley. These entities are termed Strategic Partners of the World Economic Forum.   News Corporation, the parent of Fox News, was another strategic partner of the event.  Rest of Article   http://www.aim.org/aim-re...
