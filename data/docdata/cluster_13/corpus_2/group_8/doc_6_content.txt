Following David Johns rebuff of Ross Stones formal offer to pay A$2million for TKR, Bathurst 2007, on behalf of a true Kiwi syndicate, there seemed little point in trying to negotiate any further with the gentleman in question.     My personal belief has always been that sooner or later we would be able to negotiate with either a receiver or an Official Assignee.     I hope to do that in the very near future.     It should be noted that the official asignee, effectively owns all David Johns assets, ie 100% of TKR, and 70% of Numero Uno Investments Ltd [ the company that holds the VESA teams agreement.     Mike McDonald or David John have zero say in what happens to these entities, which will be sold off to help repay David Johns personal secured creditors, namely the ANZ Bank [NZ$358,000 at the time of his Bankruptcy, and Bernard Gillion, NZ$750,000 plus interest] plus anybody else that may come out of the wood work.     Regards,     Mark Petch.                       peckstar  that last line is worth noting, Mark must know way more than you give him credit for to make that statement. To me confirms he is not going to steal the brand. He's going to put things right for TKRs Fans Supporters and suppliers and how. IT AINT GOING TO BE A CHEAP DEAL!  MP doesn't do cheap. He is yet another NZer who does hard work/a long haul guy. My memories have a very hot BMW2002 racing at Pukekohe in the 60s...And he's still a racer the following century, no flash in the pan style observed there.No bad press either. Do I detect a bit of Envy there pecker h&amp;#d..?
