Just ask any of the various AntiSemetic zealots, the Jews own and control all of the media, financial services, mining, energy, and transportation industries, and of course have a super majority in every congress, and parliament, and are able to whisper directly into the ears of every head of state in the world. Didnt you know this?           They made up the holocaust, dropped the nukes on Japan, ensured the Korean and Vietnam wars. They have the secret colony on the moon(where we never went BTW) and of course are single handedly responsible not only for the current financial situation, but for the creation of AIDS, birdflu, and rabies.    Then of course we all know the Jews pulled off 9-11, and then Madrid and London, but there is little question Mumbai was nothing but a false flag operation.       All 7billion people in the world are merely slaves to the wishes of the 15million or so Jews on the planet.        Sorry for my rant, but the line of thinking by some on here is beyond me when it comes to the Jewish issue. But I hope it gives some insight for you Pandora.                      You know I would not be surprised if Jewish people were in every business and the most successful too!      Scriptures say. God will bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse Israel.   They are the apple of His eye, His chosen people.         So it seems pretty easy to believe that they would be more intelligent than the average Joe, Better looking, more successful and blessed above all in every way.      I think that bothers some people to no end but I think its kind of cool.  If I was not what I already am, Id want to be from the tribes of Israel.  Ephraim to be exact.         For all the things you and I disagree on, I am very very glad that we agree about Anti-Semitism.  I would rather agree with you on that than anything else I think.
