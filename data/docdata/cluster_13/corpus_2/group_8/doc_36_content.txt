The company has thought this through and set things up things up so that they won't have to pay POP nor send more people to HKG than they wish to.  There is nothing stopping them from awarding everyone eligible pilot who bids HKG on the excess a spot, later canceling 09-01 before it closes, and then going back and canceling the training of the pilots they don't want in HKG in inverse seniority order.  That series of events gets them what they want without paying POP or physically putting excess bodies in HKG.  It's greasy, but it's legal per a cba that wasn't written by either side for the type of situation we are in presently.                         So, in your scenario...The guys that have their training cancelled, don't get excessed anywhere, after all?
