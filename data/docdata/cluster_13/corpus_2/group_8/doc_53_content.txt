         I had to laugh when I read this story.....  Almost makes you wonder how much other money has been squandered to force this bailout of banks....         http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/nyregion/21scam.html?_r=3                      Quote:              Prosecutors said the scheme began in September, when Citibank received a package with documents purportedly signed by officials of the Ethiopian bank instructing Citibank to accept instructions by fax. There was also a list of officials who could be called to confirm such requests. The signatures of the officials appeared to match those in Citibanks records and were accepted by Citibank, the complaint says.        In October, Citibank received two dozen faxed requests for money to be wired, and it transferred $27 million to accounts controlled by the conspirators in Japan, South Korea, Australia, China, Cyprus and the United States, the complaint says.        Citibank called the officials whose names and numbers it had been given to verify the transactions, prosecutors said. The numbers turned out to be for cellphones in Nigeria, South Africa and Britain used by the conspirators.        Citibank, in its investigation, later determined the package of documents had come via courier from Lagos, Nigeria, rather than from the offices of the National Bank of Ethiopia, in Addis Ababa.        Citibank has credited back the lost funds to the National Bank of Ethiopia, said one person who was briefed about the situation.                         How much do you suppose the 'lost' in interest, paybacks to the Ethopian National Bank, etc., etc., etc.  And for this, Citibank issued how much in bonuses last year??
