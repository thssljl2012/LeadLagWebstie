Also, if the trees were taken down on schedule (unlikely due to the weather) the berms are to be removed the next week.  I know that the berms have already been removed in front of 100 S. Charles (BOA Building) and I'm not sure if the PM was referring to just our block on Pratt but the email seemed to indicate a larger scale project.  Can the Pratt Street redevelopment actually be underway?  I assume that if they are removing the berms they will not simply put grass on the now flattened ground...right?  But maybe they will - there is a lovely "lawn" now in front of the Verizon Building.  Has anybody heard anything about this?                      I noticed the berms in front front of the Bank of America building were removed, but I'm not sure if this signals the begining of a bigger effort.       I did, however, notice that the plaza renovations at the current Legg Mason tower is underway.                                         __________________        Click here to see '10 Inner Harbor' and other Baltimore developments
