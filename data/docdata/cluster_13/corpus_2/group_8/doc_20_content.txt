 My wife &amp; I will also be first time visitors. I have a few "general business" questions:            1. What is the most prevalent banking chain, and particularly, is there a Bank of America branch?            2. Are there Walgreen's or other general sundry stores around Old Town?            3. Is there easy access to package liquor to facilitate cocktails @ our B&amp;B?            4. Is street crime significantly better or worse than any major American or European tourist city? i.e., how tightly do I need to hold my camera?            5. If we want to spend a few hours watching other people's children participating in traditional Spring Break shenanigans, where would the best spot be?            6. I saw the one post about a questionable massage operation. Any recommendations for a legit couples spa/massage visit?            7. What's the current dollar to Commonwealth Conch exchange rate?            8. Do US appliances work in the Commonwealth?
