That's an easy one.  Dire Straits is ONE (single) rock group.  So,  "is" is appropriate.  Dire Straits *is* performing.        That would be the American usage, yes.          "I trust the evidence-based medicine  project at Oxford, who say it may make a significant (but small)  difference ... "                 The subject is "project", which is a collection of people.   This is what leads to "who say...".            "Project" is an "it" not a they or who.      I bet they think of themselves as a they.    Another example, in the U.S. you'd say, "Bank of America  is in merger talks..." but in the U.K. you'd say "Barclays are  in merger talks...", as in the following:     http://www.prlog.org/10174314-atlas-...ger-talks.html     If it can be construed as a collection of people, it's likely   to be a plural subject in British usage.  I do not know the exceptions  or limitations on this but it's extremely common and I have  seen no evidence that the more American usage would be  considered correct in the U.K.  And, I'm seeing some evidence  of drift-over of the U.K. usage to the U.S.      Is Chelsea a place or a person?      It's a football club, therefore a group of people, in this  context.    Steve
