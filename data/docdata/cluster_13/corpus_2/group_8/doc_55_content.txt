I'm actually shocked that's all it costs them. Citibank was going to pay $400 million for 20 year naming rights on the new Mets stadium. That's $20 million a year for far less exposure.     I have no trouble believing that the exposure from this attraction generates them $10 million or more a year in revenue. It might be a smart business decision to keep going with it, especially with some of the new "green" exhibits they have and such. I think it really raises people's awareness of the brand, the vehicles, and where GM is going.     Everyone needs to remember not to go overboard with this whole "every nickel corporate America spends that doesn't go into a worker's pocket is a waste" mentality. There are legitimate reasons to enter in to sponsorship arrangements.                      While what you are saying is probably true, it is a PR nightmare. Citi has been and continues to answer to their naming rights to Citi Field for the Mets. Citi is getting billions in bailouts, laying off thousands of workers, selling off parts of their business, and taking plenty of flack for their $400 million spent on naming rights to a stadium. Don't you think GM would get the same treatment from people? I am sure they would, and rightfully so. If your company is crying poverty, sponsoring a theme park attraction is not the way to spend money. Not until you return to profitablilty.      Locked: I was only kidding and being sarcastic about a Cars overlay. I sure as heck hope not.
