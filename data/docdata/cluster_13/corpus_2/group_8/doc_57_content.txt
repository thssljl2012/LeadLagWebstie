   The issuance of H1-B visas has been ongoing for years from when BEFORE the dot.com bust!! I was working here in the Silicon Valley as a banker for Citibank and saw how all the start-ups and major high tech &amp; telecommunication companies were hiring H1-B employees in all the various high tech positions and related fields. The branch that I was working at was at the center of the then Big 5 accounting firms, PWC, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Ernst &amp; Young, Arthur Anderson(remember Enron), and KMPG. According these firms HR dept., they COULDN'T find the qualified American accountants needed and had to transfer or hire those qualified from their overseas offices.  Of course, these H1-B visa workers were grateful for the opportunity to come to USA &amp; get a higher salary compared to back home. Of course, they worked anywhere from 60 -80 hour weeks based on their assignments. As the tech industry was booming &amp; growing, the US colleges couldn't graduate the software engineers, tech scientists, etc. fast enough and so more qualified H1-B visa tech related specialists were brought in to fill the jobs. Of course, those working in technology were garnering better salaries &amp; benefits, so there were not enough graduates from accounting &amp; other less high salary fields. As you can see, it was basically all about where one could make the most money that the college students were majoring in. Now, the focus has changed to find a field where one get a job after graduation.
