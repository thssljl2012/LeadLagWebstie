Greece has been rocked by a wave of violence since December, when the fatal police shooting of a 15-year-old youth triggered its worst riots in decades and shook the fragile conservative government.  Police said Revolutionary Struggle wrote to an Athens newspaper saying it was behind a failed bomb attack outside Citibank's headquarters last month, as well as a homemade bomb that went off outside a Citibank branch in the centre of the Greek capital this week but failed to injure anyone.    "They said they had staged the two bomb attacks against Citibank," a police official said. "In this brochure they are more militant than in the past. They make clear their target is not just to attack but to draw blood."  Read more:  http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssFinancialServicesAnd...                                   ...
