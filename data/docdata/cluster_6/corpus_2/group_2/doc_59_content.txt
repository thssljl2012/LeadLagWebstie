Yes you can bring a team up but you have to work your way up through each division.    If your gonna try and be cleaver then get it right. Barclays Premier League, Coca-Cola Championship, Coca-Cola League One, Coca-Cola League Two.    Yes you can bring clubs from Coca-Cola League Two to the Barclays Primier League.
