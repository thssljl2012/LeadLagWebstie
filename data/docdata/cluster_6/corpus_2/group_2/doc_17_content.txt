 Good round of games...     For those in Perth, a bunch of the Man United fans over hear will be watching the game at the Elephant and Wheelbarrow. Generaly will be a      12pm: Lunch and Drinks at the E+W  2PM: Walk to ground for Perth Glory game  5pm: walk back to pub to drown sorrows in how shit Perth is, then drink for hours and hours and then watch the Man United game at 9pm WST...     Should be good fun...
