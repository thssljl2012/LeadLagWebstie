      We won but I was disappointed with our game today tbh. Ronaldo had a few close shaves but he was too quiet today. At least Foster was kinda tested, compared to how much teams tend to attack United in most other games at least, I think he did better than kuzshack (I know it's spellt differently but i cba to check) ah well. Dam it as well, we got a game in hand again, I'd prefer being 10 people ahead of Chelsea and Liverpool, just makes up look better.
