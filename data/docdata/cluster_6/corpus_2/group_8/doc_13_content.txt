   villa were dreadful, their tactics were insane, i mean, they played 4-4-2 and decided to have no holding midfielders. petrov and barry just never tracked back.     i cant see them gettin back into 4th, in fact everton will probably sneak 5th.     united are throwing it away, it'll be so devastating if liverpool win it now. we have to beat villa now. i bet they wont play 4-4-2 at old trafford!     well cba with internationals either!! oh and i like how united play villa on the sunday then 48 hrs later in europe. thats just a complete pisstake
