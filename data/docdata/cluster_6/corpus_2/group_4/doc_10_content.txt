 My mate is a trainee groundsman at Melwood, and when playing him at fifa today told me Torres has been only in the gym on the bike and weights etc until yesterday, when he finally was able to take part in a full training session.  So he may be on the bench against Atletico.  as for the game, our own fault for not getting the second goal, as for gerrard going for the chip, should of just hit it low. gg though spurs, best of luck to them, and as for the booing of keane what a bunch of wankers.
