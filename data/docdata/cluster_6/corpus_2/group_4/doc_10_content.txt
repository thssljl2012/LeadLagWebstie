    quote  KPmufc    You would like that wouldn&amp;#039;t you.   It woll never happen    If your talking about Tevez to Liverpool, then its a possibility! Its out of Utd&amp;#039;s hands isnt it. If Tevez doesnt wanna sign due to lack of first team appearences then he signs for whoever he wants.  In the real world though, it wont happen. We&amp;#039;ve spent 40 million on strikers in the last 2 years. We wont go an spend 20 million plus on another. Although he would look good on our bench!    I think he&amp;#039;ll go in the summer. Probably to Barca perhaps? Maybe Real!
