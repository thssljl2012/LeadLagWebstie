     quote  D I O S    Nolan stands in the 6 yard box every time at which point Nolan and subsequent goalie push each other. It&amp;#039;s 50/50. Push one way, push the other. Standing in the way is not a foul!  A 50/50? When a goalkeeper is trying to come out &amp;amp; claim a cross? With Nolan sticking his leg out also. How do you work that out?  I didnt know Alan Parry had said it was a goal. In that case it must of been. Although out of interest Dion Dublin said it was a foul.
