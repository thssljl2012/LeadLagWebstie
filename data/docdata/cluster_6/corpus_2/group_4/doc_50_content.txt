 Anybody see Roy Keane&amp;#039;s rant about pundits? He&amp;#039;s too bloody right. Everyone is brainwashed these days and hardly come up with any opinions of their own anymore. Arsenal in a crisis and all that. Bullshit. I know you&amp;#039;ve lost to Fulham, Stoke and Hull, but you&amp;#039;re now what, 3 points behind? Well in this title race imo.  And Chelsea Boi, I just noticed your comment about Mikel? How the hell was he at fault for 2 of Roma&amp;#039;s goals?! He lost the ball and then tried to win it back by diving in which was inexperience, that was for their third. The first goal was the entire team with shit defending, and the second was an unbelievable strike. I wouldn&amp;#039;t blame Mikel for either. Sky trying to stir up shit where there is none.  If Mineiro starts tomorrow I&amp;#039;ll lose a lot of faith in Scolari because there&amp;#039;s no way Mikel deserves to be dropped for Wednesday.
