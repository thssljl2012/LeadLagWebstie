 Im suprised Gomes didnt smash it in as he collected if after it hit the bar anyway!  It was so unlucky though! Credit to Gomes actually on the 2nd save!  EDIT: Nel stop being a tit. Just cos he wanted to play for a big club, get off his back. You more than anyone should realise what a good player he is! The goals will come, although goals are only a small part of his game. In addition to that, he has scored 2 Champions League goals already, something he wouldnt be able to do whilst at Tottenham ...
