   quote   Mycon     I can&amp;#039;t believe how only Chelsea have really dealt with Stoke&amp;#039;s long throws this year.  He was injured for the Chelsea game, i think.  Great result for Chelsea today, good for us to get over the lfc game. Anelka&amp;#039;s goals we&amp;#039;re all tap ins apparently but oh well  . Deco sounded like he did good today aswell, setanta rating him 8.5. Sucks watching games from commentary, right now im sat on a cruise ship full of old people, paying 55p a minute to follow todays games  .  Another point, i was reading through the ratings of the Liverpool game and under Mikel is said &amp;quot;Has to do more&amp;quot;. Which is annoying because he&amp;#039;s replacing Makelele, breaks up attacks and passes it along, yet hes being criticised in the media for not doing enough when all Maka got was praise and today i was looking at Goal.com&amp;#039;s playing ratings (I know, i was desperate :ashamed) and they said he should be sold in January, but then who&amp;#039;s going to take the DM role? Essien? no and Miniero isn&amp;#039;t first team standard. I know Mikels no Makelele yet but he doesn&amp;#039;t deserve criticism imo.
