Should those who should be getting passover from a previous bid (727 CAs) get a HKG CA slot or more senior folks who bid it on a subsequent bid?                      If I understand your question correctly, different bid, so seniority rules on that bid.  To keep passover pay (those not senior enough to hold on this subsequent bid), I believe those individuals must keep HKG Capt on their standing bid.  Just my interpretation of the CBA...could be wrong.
