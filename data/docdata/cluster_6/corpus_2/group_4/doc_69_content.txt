     Quote:                         Anyway, Liverpool has been playing exceptionally well this year. Although I really dislike them, I wish them luck. Arsenal and Man UTD. will be switching off place, Arsenal seems to be still a bit hot headed from last year&amp;#039;s games. Chelsea can pretty much go to hell imho.                     Man U are miles ahead of Arsenal. Arsenal have become leaderless and inconsistent. They win against Man U but lose against Fulham. They have some amazing players but I think Arsene just doesn&amp;#039;t really cope with big money (though he&amp;#039;s brilliant at spending on a budget). Man U have plenty of leaders and in my opinion are still better than Liverpool (though I half-support Liverpool and hope they&amp;#039;ll come 1st/2nd). Chelsea will win, I think. And Arsenal might drop out of the top 4 for Aston Villa though I doubt it. Probably 4th.
