   quote   DjedwardSmith     How many of Arsenal&amp;#039;s current team were brought through the ranks though?  Bender , Fabby, Walcott, Denilson, Diaby, Vela, Clichy etc...  Freudian slip?  Also the irony of this comment is funny!    quote  SuperCesc07    Well Done RED DEVIL 4 LIFE for speaking out of ur arse hole  And to Genls, we have no idea why Elmander is playing left wing. Presumeably becasue Megson can&amp;#039;t bare to accept he was wrong. The odd thing was Taylor is left footed, Elmander right(We think!) and they were playing on the right and left respectively?!
