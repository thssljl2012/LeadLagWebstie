No complaints from me. We had plenty of possession and created plenty of half chances, but Arsenal played the counter attack beautifully after the first goal and should have had a penalty too (Webb couldn&amp;#039;t see the shirt tug from his angle though).      Carrick&amp;#039;s yellow was ridiculous though - he had every right to go for that ball the way he did.
