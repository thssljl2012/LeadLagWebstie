   quote   Mycon     I can&amp;#039;t believe Ronaldo&amp;#039;s goal from the Berbatov assist wasn&amp;#039;t on GOTM. I know it was tough competition and I would put a few ahead of it but it was a thing of beauty what he did.   It was scored in november.  I guess you mean todays, but seriously if you mean wednesdays, look at all those goals that are in it, they are awesome and generally better.
