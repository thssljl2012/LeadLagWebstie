   I may be misenterpreting your post, but i&amp;#039;m hoping your realising the sarcasm in mine right? And no, Carragher&amp;#039;s a yid. 3 own goals in so many years, he&amp;#039;s better at scoring for us than Zokora!!  And the Rory Delap tackle on Walcott was nothing. Sure it was late, and a swipe, but it&amp;#039;s going to happen to Theo alot in his playing days. It&amp;#039;s the only way you can stop him, especially on the counter. If your going to send Delap off for that, they&amp;#039;ll be more cards than at a Hugh Hefner birthday party. It was a yellow, only really nit picky refs would give a red for that. As for Shawcross&amp;#039; i think it was poor.
