Yes there has been a lack of big centre forwards produced over the past 5 or so years. I mean if you asked me to name you better centre forwards around the age of 23-24 i could name you a dozen id say (Ibisevic, Pogbreyak, Huntelaar just for starters).                      Well why not take it futher, who is the best in the world atm?       I say Ibrahimovic.      EDIT: Can&amp;#039;t forget Ameobi
