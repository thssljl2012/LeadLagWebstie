   quote   The Realest       quote  SkySports    &amp;quot;The priority now is to work with the clubs and the police to identify the individuals involved. The FA wants anyone found guilty of throwing missiles to face the strongest possible action.  &amp;quot;That includes life bans from attending football matches.&amp;quot;  So if the fans are facing lifetime bans for throwing coins, surely Drogba should receive a ban for doing exactly the same thing(even though his offence was worse as there were more people he could have hit children old women etc). I bet he gets away with a silly fine or something.   Throw the book at him.  Just be prepared to duck when he throws it back.
