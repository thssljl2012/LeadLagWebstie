 Question for United fans, and I guess anyone else who has an opinion on it.  How much do you think United miss Quieroz? Someone on 606 mentioned it and I think they have a point. He was a very good coach, and someone who the players seemed to respect and like (Ronaldo more than any I imagine), now they have Mike Phelan and with all due respect to the man, he doesn&amp;#039;t seem to be on Quieroz&amp;#039;s level. Quieroz used be on the touchline talking to the players, Phelan doesn&amp;#039;t seem to do that. I see Phelan as a yes man with Fergie, whereas I think Quieroz would stand up to him and give him his honest opinion.  Just curious that&amp;#039;s all...
