 Right ok im going to spam again lol. Just doing myself as test run. I have loaded Corals gone to football then the barclays prem league. Clicked on the top one Everton V Fulham and I see odds for a draw are 3.5. So I pop a tick in there. I then go over to betfair and to foot ball -&amp;amp;gt; barclays -&amp;amp;gt; and open Everton V Fulham. I then click on black and lay. I ssee it says Everton, Fulham and the draw. I am persuming that &amp;amp;quot;the&amp;amp;quot; draw means to draw? If so I then have odds for a draw there of 3.9. So that would suit me being higher than my odds of 3.5 that I back.      Ok so to shove on my imaginary money.     10 SNR.     3.50 @ corals means I would get back 25 ... and then...  3.90 @ betfair where if I loose I need to pay out 18.83 (so that amount needs to be in my account pref more) But I pay down 6.49.     And whatever happens I get back 6.17 profit.     Providing of course all my maths is correct.     Any comments??
