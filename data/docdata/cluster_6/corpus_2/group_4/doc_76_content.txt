 In no way was Liverpool&amp;#039;s finishing better.  Both sides only finished the one chance each, although you could even argue a Spurs player might have got to the ball had Carragher not done. Liverpool were far less efficient with their many chances, so you could argue that Spurs had the better finishing on the day being that they would have had a greater chance to goal ratio. Either way Liverpool were not more clinical.
