   quote   DjedwardSmith     And I enjoy reading how, because it&amp;#039;s Arsenal, it&amp;#039;s poached, rather than bought.  It&amp;#039;s probably because most of the young players Arsenal got were bought at much lower prices than most top clubs pay for them, but if it makes you feel any better, I say it as United poaching Anderson and Nani from Porto.
