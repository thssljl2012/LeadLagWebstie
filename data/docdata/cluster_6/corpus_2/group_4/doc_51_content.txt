   quote   Junior Messi     Djed. Please. Read what i have to say. I have heard it from three members, who have seen Sweeney constantly quoting my posts, rather than someone else who has said the same thing. Fact is, Sweeney and i have never seen eye to eye. Now read that please, and give me a *bleep*ing break. I have tried to end it up but some people dragged it back up. Now i don&amp;#039;t give a toss if knowone agrees with me, but there is no need to quote every single one of my posts just for cheap kicks. And for the record, i&amp;#039;m speaking to another member on MSN who sees this. So ffs, open your eyes, and see what is going on.     Stop playing the innocent victim.   In case you can&amp;#039;t see the many members on here who have said about they would do the same thing, quoting you on something you&amp;#039;ve said that they&amp;#039;ve disagreed with.   It  IS  possible to disagree with what somebody says a lot, without holding a vendetta as you seem to think he has against you. I don&amp;#039;t give a shit what other people think about this little theory, but the fact is, it&amp;#039;s not a crime to disagree with almost everything somebody says. I found myself doing that a lot when Dinosoid posted, and yet I found myself quoting his posts purely for their content without realising he posted it.  All of it, as I thought the same thing about someone I know who supports Spurs. Big whoop, still in the bottom three      This message was edited by DjedwardSmith on Nov 01 2008.
