But even if we count Benzema, that&amp;#039;s only two people (who are both extremely talented individuals).    Regardless of how good people think he is or isn&amp;#039;t, he&amp;#039;s not useless, and he&amp;#039;ll certainly improve to be a good Premier League player.    Whether or not that&amp;#039;s at Arsenal is another matter.
