Kinnear is annoying.     I assume he&amp;#039;s trying to get a &amp;amp;quot;siege mentality&amp;amp;quot; thing going, but he&amp;#039;s coming off looking like a complete twat.     Ridiculous claims about referees being against him, launching into foul mouthed assaults on anyone in sight.     Hey Joe, you&amp;#039;re still in the relegation zone. Nice going!
