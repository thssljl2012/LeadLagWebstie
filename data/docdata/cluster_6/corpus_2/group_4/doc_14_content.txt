I have loaded Corals gone to football then the barclays prem league. Clicked on the top one Everton V Fulham and I see odds for a draw are 3.5. So I pop a tick in there. I then go over to betfair and to foot ball -&amp;amp;gt; barclays -&amp;amp;gt; and open Everton V Fulham. I then click on black and lay. I ssee it says Everton, Fulham and the draw. I am persuming that &amp;amp;quot;the&amp;amp;quot; draw means to draw? If so I then have odds for a draw there of 3.9. So that would suit me being higher than my odds of 3.5 that I back.      Ok so to shove on my imaginary money.     10 SNR.           3.50 @ corals means I would get back 25 ... and then...  3.90 @ betfair where if I loose I need to pay out 18.83 (so that amount needs to be in my account pref more) But I pay down 6.49.     And whatever happens I get back 6.17 profit.     Providing of course all my maths is correct.     Any comments??                      Hi again - are you using a spreadsheet for your calculations?      According to the matcher sheet ...     10 @ 3.5 gives 25 profit if win at bookies - agreed     9.09 lay stake at Betfair, assuming 5% commission, would lose 26.36 at Betfair, resulting in a loss of 1.36.     Or conversely a loss of 10 at the bookies and a &amp;amp;quot;win&amp;amp;quot; at Betfair of 8.64 - a loss of 1.36.     The odds are too far apart for a qualifier really - you should be looking for the back and lay odds to be as close together as possible. The higher the odds, the bigger the difference a few points can make.     hope that helps.     Edited to say - I realise this is an imaginary bet!
