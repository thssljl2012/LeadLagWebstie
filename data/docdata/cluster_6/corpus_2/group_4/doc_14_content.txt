 WOOO THEY USED CAPITULATED THE SAME As I DID...   Ermm, yeah.  Silvestre and Gallas are being paid by their former clubs to sabotage us. Silvestre is probably one of the wosrt players I&amp;#039;ve ever seen play at the back for us, and yes, I&amp;#039;ve seen Senderos and Cygan play.  And Gallas goes forward too much and, if we&amp;#039;re being honest, wouldn&amp;#039;t break into United or Chelsea&amp;#039;s starting 11. Toure for captain, but I think Fabby may be given it. He is the fulcrum of our team so it&amp;#039;s good in a sense, but Toure seems to be more of a natural leader.  Either way though, I *bleep*ing despise Silvestre, and Gallas has run out of chances in my mind. We NEED to buy in January, or else we will seriously struggle to stay in the top four, let alone keep up a respectable title challenge which already seems jaded.
