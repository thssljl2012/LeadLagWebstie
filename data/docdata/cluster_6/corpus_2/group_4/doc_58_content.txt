 I wouldn&amp;#039;t be surprised if it&amp;#039;s not mentioned or shown on MotD so I&amp;#039;ll tell you now: Gallas had a great game today, one of his best ever. He also showed bags of this leadership which he is always accused of lacking. Our team was in disarray and frantic chaos in the second half just after Nasri&amp;#039;s 2nd, and when Almunia was receiving treatment on the pitch he went around his team-mates and had a quiet word with them, giving them instructions and advice. He seemed to reorganise the team and it clearly had a positive effect
