   quote   Junior Messi     Alright. Well we&amp;#039;ll *bleep*ing leave it now. Sweeney didn&amp;#039;t need to post really, and hopefully he can see that.  Well apart from the fact that there was nothing wrong with the way I put my post across and everything I said was right, then yeah I totally agree. If it wasn&amp;#039;t me who said it, you wouldn&amp;#039;t have had a problem with it really.  I honestly don&amp;#039;t care if you and your daft associates take issue with my posts to be honest. I come here to try and have intellectual football conversations with people and when I see things like &amp;quot;goaLOLOLOL&amp;quot; and other such rubbish I can&amp;#039;t just sit back and say nothing. If you think I&amp;#039;m picking on you then try not to talk such bollocks and you&amp;#039;ll soon see me leave you alone.  Now have a go at me because I quoted you again, as if that&amp;#039;s some kind of frowned upon act.      [size=1][color=#666666]This message was edited by sweenEy on Nov 01 2008.
