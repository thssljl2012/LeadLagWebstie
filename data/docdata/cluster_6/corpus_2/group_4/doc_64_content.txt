I don&amp;#039;t know why you&amp;#039;ve mentioned Roeder in that lot.      We might not even be getting sold anymore so who knows about the new manager, but Kinnear hasn&amp;#039;t done a bad job anyway.      Hope he doesn&amp;#039;t get the job permanently, but I&amp;#039;m certainly more comfortable having Kinnear in charge than I am with Chris Hughton.
