 oh yes, great win today.    quote  g_lfc    Forgot to mention before, King is awesome. Pity he cant seem to string 2 games together. Hope he is able to rid himself from his injuries though.  Well, we can only hope he can. Harry said it himself, if ledley has to be saturday to saturday, thats how it has to be. That was one of Ramos&amp;#039;s *bleep* ups, playing him in arguably less important games. And Yes, King is awesome, my best english defender comments are not wrong, he is awesome. One day, hopefully, he will get the recognition he deserves. He is better than Sol ever was.   Anyway..    This message was edited by Sam(moderator) on Nov 01 2008.
