Give Bendtner some time. He&amp;#039;ll be good. He is still young.      Fantastic win. One of our best wins in recent memory. Nasri was superb. His 2nd goal was special.      Like the look of Rafael. Fantastic finish as well.      Don&amp;#039;t understand how we can beat United, yet draw to Tottenham and lose to Hull, Fulham and Stoke
