  Looking forward to the game today! I think whilst Tottenham have improved they&amp;#039;ve hardly set the world alight so far, beating a poor Bolton &amp;amp; then being outplayed by Arsenal only to be handed a point! So hopefully they still dont find top form today &amp;amp; we&amp;#039;ll have too much for them! Im dissapointed that it seems Torres will miss out again but its law that players scored agaisnt their former clubs so hopefully Keane wont let us down!  Hopefully Keane will recieve a good reception from the Tottenham fans, do you think he will?
