   quote   Subaru7      Gerrard has done something evil to the framework, hit it twice in ten minutes, wow.    Yeah, Liverpool very much on the attack right now with Kuyt missing a good chance too. Gomes is still looking dodgy, this looks like it could be a cracker of a match with Tottenham occasionally hitting Liverpool on the counter - no major chances from them in this half so far though.
