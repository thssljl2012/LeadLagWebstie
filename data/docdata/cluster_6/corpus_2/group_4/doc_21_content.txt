            Quote from: exiledinyorkshire on  Yesterday  at 12:01:50 PM   Why is Felix so upset about getting shite for saying that. Its funny when someone makes that kind of comment and then against the odds is proved wrong? Its funny Felix get a grip. However why is he being derided so badly by some on here calling him a Beaut and such, surely there cant be many who actually called 15 points. Blind belief is for those with little intelligence. the probability of us winning all 5 of those games was low.      there&amp;amp;#039;s one thing someone saying they doubt we would win 5 games, it&amp;amp;#039;s another thing saying what Felix said. He&amp;amp;#039;s not on his own though, check any match thread for kneejerk reactionary&amp;amp;#039;s, it&amp;amp;#039;s fucking full of &amp;amp;#039;em.
