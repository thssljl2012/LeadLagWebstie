   quote   g_lfc     Come on pack in crying please! Im trying to mourn my teams loss, while your worried about Sweeny picking wholes in your comments!    Forgot to mention before, King is awesome. Pity he cant seem to string 2 games together. Hope he is able to rid himself from his injuries though.  Big test for us now. Happy we&amp;#039;ve got a European night before the next the league game. We really get a great atmosphere on European nights &amp;amp; with Atletico in town it could be one of the best in a while. Also, no dissrespect to WBA, but they are one of the better fixtures I could of hoped for to get back on track!  I think Im slowly dragging myself out of depression ..   Dont kick urself , ur joint first in the league 5 points ahead of us, 4 ahead of Man U , and we can do u a favour if we beat them next week, so stop moaning
