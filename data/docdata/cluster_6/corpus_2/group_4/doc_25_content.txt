   quote   Memento Mori       quote   DjedwardSmith     I haven&amp;#039;t yet seen what he said as I&amp;#039;ve just got in,. but if he&amp;#039;s on about the Stoke game then the tackles that injured Walcott and Adebayor were disgraceful. Shawcross&amp;#039;s could and possibly should have been a red. Off the ball, out of play, high up his calf. Walcotts was  a clear swipe at him from behind , which again could have been given as a red. Cynical, dirty fouls.   Nasri on Barton. Swings and roundabout, my friend.   I&amp;#039;ve always wondered about that. Swings and roundabouts. Yes. Two different things.  Shawcross and Delap&amp;#039;s fouls were both cynical, nasty challenges which both seemed to seek to bring the player down, and no doubt hurt them.  Nasri&amp;#039;s little swipe was nothing on that, yet was still a foul. Swings and roundabouts indeed. Under the same header of a foul, but vastly different when viewed.
