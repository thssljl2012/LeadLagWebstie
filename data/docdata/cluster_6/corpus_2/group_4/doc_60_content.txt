    Cech Bosingwa - Alex -  Terry - Bridge Deco -  Belletti -  Lampard Joe Cole - Drogba - Kalou   That&amp;#039;s what SkySports reckon our line-up will be.  I don&amp;#039;t want Belletti starting. He tries to score bullets all the time. Yes he scores good goals, but he&amp;#039;s not as good as Mikel. Hopefully Mikel will be in the line-up. Bit annoyed that Anelka might miss out, but whenever Drogba&amp;#039;s back he usually starts. I&amp;#039;m also happier Kalou might be starting instead of Malouda.  I reckon we&amp;#039;ll win this game. If we go 2-0 up before half time it could be a rout. We do have the best attack in terms of goals scored in the premiership while they have the worst defence because apparently they&amp;#039;ve conceded the most.
