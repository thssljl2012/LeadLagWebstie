   quote   FIFAleachy       Selling;  Bassong Alan Smith Geremi  Offers welcomed, need selling!  Do we get a january transfer window?     As Ryan said, January window will have to be done through the game. It would be really complicated to do those transfers. I haven&amp;#039;t decided yet if there will be it or not. If there will, I will put one some limit, such as 2 transfers allowed.
