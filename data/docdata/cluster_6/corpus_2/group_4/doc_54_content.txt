   quote   Will     I think you&amp;#039;re confused. It can hardly be described as finishing when neither team actually finished the chances they had. Tottenham finished one of their chances, as did Liverpool. Although, had Liverpool finished their chances, Spurs would have been done and dusted long before Carragher scored your first goal.   Surely the term &amp;quot;finishing&amp;quot; refers to the shot on goal, and is still classed as a finish even if it doesn&amp;#039;t go in?  For example, missing a good chance is poor finishing while scoring from a tight angle is good finishing. As far as I knew it&amp;#039;s still classed as a finish or attempt at one whether the ball end up in the net or not.  Liverpool missed far more chances, so their finishing was poorer than that of Spurs.
