   quote   RED DEVIL 4 LIFE     Anelka&amp;#039;s goals are nothing special but credit to Scolari for putting him in a position where he can get more goals.   Also, well done to Danny Welbeck for scoring a great goal against Stoke. Lets hope he keeps his feet on the ground and can turn in to a world class player. Just to let all your Arsenal fans know, this is what we call a home grown player, not a player like Merida or Fabregas who is nicked of Barcelona.      What? Some of his goals are fantastic finishes. Even though they aren&amp;#039;t amazing goals, but they are tidy finishes. Chelsea fans aren&amp;#039;t complaining, because a goal&amp;#039;s a goal if it hits the back of the net. Anelka&amp;#039;s done that 12 times in the league so far so it&amp;#039;s all good.  Welbeck&amp;#039;s goal was fantastic. I don&amp;#039;t think he&amp;#039;ll ever become a fantastic striker but could become quite decent.
