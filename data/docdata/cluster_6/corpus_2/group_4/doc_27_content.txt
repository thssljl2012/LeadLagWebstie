 True, can&amp;#039;t really sit and say that this would have happened because of this etc...  Personally I didn&amp;#039;t and still don&amp;#039;t rate Anderson. Might just be me, but I can&amp;#039;t recall him doing anything other than winning the ball off of Walcott, and skying a shot miles wide.  If United finished their chances they would have won, but they didn&amp;#039;t and as a result I&amp;#039;m now *bleep*ing buzzing    Biased, of course, but does anyone think that the best games in the league are ALWAYS Arsenal United. Only really challenged by Arsenal Chelsea or Pool Chelsea.
