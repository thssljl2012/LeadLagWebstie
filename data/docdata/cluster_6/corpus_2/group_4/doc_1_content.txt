   quote   g_lfc     I&amp;#039;ll never know, in a million years how we never won that. And thats all I have to say about it.  But just like it was too early before the game to say we could win the league, its too early to say we wont win the league like some idiot has suggested.   As for Redknapp having magical powers, I think he has alot more luck than magical powers.  No way on earth did Tottenham deserve to win that.  And thats not me being bitter at all.   We&amp;#039;ve got 6 games now, which we should win, hopefully that&amp;#039;ll stand us in good stead.         You would know a lot about deserving a victory would you.
