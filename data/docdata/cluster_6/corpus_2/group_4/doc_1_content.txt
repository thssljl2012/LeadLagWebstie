      how someone disses one of the greatest pure strikers of all team especially when they are a fan of the french national team... i mean arsenal is beyond me. I would kill to have him in a reds jersey. And great game for the boys, especially Keane. Finally broke out in the EPL for the scousers. Great pass by Gerrard also.   and yeah i wouldn&amp;#039;t mess with martyn knowledge... Hey marty, you think rafa will get anymore then a three year extension? Thats what i figure they will give him.  and yeah leesmithg, theo isn&amp;#039;t the future, nasri is...
