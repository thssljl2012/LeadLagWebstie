   quote   DjedwardSmith     I haven&amp;#039;t yet seen what he said as I&amp;#039;ve just got in,. but if he&amp;#039;s on about the Stoke game then the tackles that injured Walcott and Adebayor were disgraceful. Shawcross&amp;#039;s could and possibly should have been a red. Off the ball, out of play, high up his calf. Walcotts was  a clear swipe at him from behind , which again could have been given as a red. Cynical, dirty fouls.   Nasri on Barton. Swings and roundabout, my friend.
