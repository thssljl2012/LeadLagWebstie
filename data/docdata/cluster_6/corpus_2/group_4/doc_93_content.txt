  I dunno. When we bought Anelka i thought he had some style on him. But all i see him doin is that he just times his position. Whereas other chelsea players are beginning to show some technique in their game  even including Carvalho and Terry. I&amp;#039;m beginning to think Anelka is the worst. Well at least he better than....Cech...right?     Well i guess, as long he getting the goals. I shouldn&amp;#039;t complain too much.
