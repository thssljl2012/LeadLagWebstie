O purlease- he wasnt a winger for most of your games....half the time he was your most advanced player with Rooney and Tevez putting in the amount of legwork that they do.     Im not trying to take anything away from him, but I just dont subscribe to the whole &amp;quot;he is a winger&amp;quot; stuff.     Torres got 30something, cant actually remember off the top of my head and CBA checking.  And Torres missed a few games at the start through injury.
