   quote   Pappi        Im finding it pretty hard tbh Maybe because Im playing Pro Evo a lot, and 'cos I had a great save on 08 - like 7 seasons in and I was doing really well and stuff and I just cba to build another team like that again    I also find the gameplay not as smooth as 08, just my opinion though, so dont berate me          I'd just got 3 seasons into what I thought was a great game with Man utd, which didn't help improve 09  I'm gonna try setting my game to commentary only, because as admiral butthead said it makes you bored watching a game for a long time  Anyone recommend a good game for me? I tried Leeds a few moments ago but didn't like them right from the off. I had a great game with them on 08 in which I won the EPl and bought Benzema. I would try forfar, but won the Cl with them on 08, so again, maybe not a good idea  i hear QPr are fun to play as?  I just can't get into the game at all and can't find a consistent tactic like 08. Anyone got one that might work?  EDIT:// even on 08 I didn't like to keep one game on the go, mainly because I NEVER change jobs. Don't like leaving a well built up team. The furthest I ever got was 8 seasons with Forfar, but even then I had like...ten different games on the go
