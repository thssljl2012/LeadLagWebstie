   quote   Arsenal09     For Man utd to win the league again for the 3rd time in a roll you&amp;#039;d think the league has become a bit more predictable.   I don&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;s become predictable as such.  I just think United have the best squad, the best starting XI when all are fit, and the best manager in the league.  I wouldn&amp;#039;t be surprised if Liverpool finished 2nd now though, they showed today that they are legit contenders.  If I was Arsenal I&amp;#039;d be more worried about Villa creeping up on them in 4th spot instead of looking upwards to the title. I really don&amp;#039;t think Arsenal have a chance of winning the league.
