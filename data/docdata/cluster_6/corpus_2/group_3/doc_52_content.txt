 Is Skrtels injury really a posterior cruciate ligament?? Maybe I read it wrong, I&amp;#039;m hungover like hell, but isnt posterior the arse? I&amp;#039;m so confused.  And why the hell is Jenas in the England squad?? The guys a joke. Shouldda called up Bullard again.  I think we need Klinsmann to come and save us, bayern are struggling so why not? Someone like him or Gordon Strachan, or Roy Keane, just somebody who wont take any shit, Neil bloody Warnock would work, a proper Bastard is what we need.  It&amp;#039;s beyond reason how we couldnt score, How can you create that many chances and not put at least one away? And Ramos&amp;#039;s in game management is laughable, people said Jols subs were predictable, but this guy seems to just chuck on whoever is scratching their nuts on the bench and puts them in the weirdest positions, Bentley at right back??? what a pratt.
