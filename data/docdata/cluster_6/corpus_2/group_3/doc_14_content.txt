   quote   GregtheGreat        quote   Flitty     Any Newcastle fans know what Fraser Forster like?  We&amp;#039;ve just signed him on a 1 month loan.     The lads got potential alright. He&amp;#039;s highly rated by the coaches, and Given thinks he&amp;#039;s a great player. Going out on loan and getting first team experience is exactly what he needs, it will help him compete with Krul for 3rd choice.     Here&amp;#039;s what Sky Sports make of him.   http://www.skysports.com/football/transfers/scout/0,24035,15198_4012422,00.html
