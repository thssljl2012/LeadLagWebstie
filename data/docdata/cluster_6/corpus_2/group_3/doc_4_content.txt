            Quote from: RAFA - 6 - 19 on October &amp;amp;nbsp;3, 2008, 01:15:53 PM   i think sunderland, blackburn and villa all have the potenital to do us a favour&amp;amp;nbsp; this weekend we must beat city to enable us to capitalise as i cannot see chelsea, united and arsenal all winning this weekend   Well, Sunderland did us a favour!&amp;amp;nbsp;  It&amp;amp;#039;s a shame that they didn&amp;amp;#039;t hang on for a win, but it&amp;amp;#039;s 2 points lost by Arsenal
