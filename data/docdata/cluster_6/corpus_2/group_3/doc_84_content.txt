          I thought that this was the real banana skin, and it almost happened (glad I was wrong though). The rest are more direct games.   Wigan - keep the ball on the ground, and pass as we know. We have their measure. Chelsea - I just can&amp;amp;#039;t see us losing this one! We can nick it, and I hope we are the ones to end their home record Pompey - no comparison, this is not Pompey of last year. We have this one covered.
