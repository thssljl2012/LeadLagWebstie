   quote   Will     I wonder how long Arsenal fans (mainly the clown posting above) will use their &amp;quot;we played our youngsters&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;it was our reserves&amp;quot; every time they lose a game, or every year they continue to finish trophyless. Along time I&amp;#039;ll say. You put out a team that on any other night could have beat Spurs, but you got hammered 5-1 instead. Get over it and stop making excuses.    Well said.  You had a side capable of beating them, and you lost, nothing else to it.
