   quote   Validation     Spurs should give Ramos one more game, if they lose then he&amp;#039;ll walk. They&amp;#039;ve given him time to fix it and he hasn&amp;#039;t.    Last thing we need is to be managerless going into these next few games.  If I had to suggest a next manager, I would say Allardyce. But I don&amp;#039;t really want to think about replacing him atm.
