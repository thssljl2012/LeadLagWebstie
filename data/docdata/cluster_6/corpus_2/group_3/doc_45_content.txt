   quote   g_lfc       quote  Junior Messi    I think people are more displeased at Liverpool coming back and &amp;#039;scraping&amp;#039; if you will another win. Boro, Citeh and now Wigan have all been last gasp wins. And Alonso once again being the culprit of a sending off. May just be a coincidence, but you have to be a bit suspect that three sending offs in three games are all a result of Alonso being tackled. Would like to know if the first Valencia booking is one, as it seemed like that changed the game.  Still cannot wait to see Zaki&amp;#039;s goals.  How is somebody a culprit of getting someone sent off? He can hardly help the tackles that come in on him. The decision is the refs. Valencia got booked for breaking from the wall early i think. And his tackle on Alonso was a bad one. Zabaletas was a red last week. Cahills was probably a mistake from the ref, still a bad tackle tho. And your forgetting Vidic got sent off agaisnt Alonso too. And that was a stone wall red. Well 2nd yellow.   I said it may just be a coincidence.
