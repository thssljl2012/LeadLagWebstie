   quote   _Chernaboug     I will say Dj that I really don&amp;#039;t need any more &amp;quot;fuel&amp;quot; to dislike him any more. Nearly everything I see and read about him just rubs me the wrong way, just like Cantona used to.  I don&amp;#039;t think I&amp;#039;ve ever honestly attacked Fabregas for no reason or out of nowhere, to be fair. It&amp;#039;s just me expressing my displeasure at something he&amp;#039;s done at the time. The fact that it&amp;#039;s happened enough for me to have a reputation for not liking him would suggest that he&amp;#039;s a colourful character at the very least.      The reasons why you hate him I can see but thats why  like him.
