 I have no problems with Sunday games at all if there&amp;#039;s European football on the Thursday before. I would prefer if most games were at Saturday 3pm as it&amp;#039;s a lot more exciting but you do have to look at fitness levels and things like that. No use having a game pretty much as soon as you land, the standard of play will go down too if players aren&amp;#039;t fresh.
