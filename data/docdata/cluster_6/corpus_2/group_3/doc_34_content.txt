   Well Joe Cole might be a sub. I hope to see Kalouda play again because I feel they&amp;#039;ve been playing really well in the last few weeks.  I can&amp;#039;t wait until Drogba&amp;#039;s back. We need some muscle upfront and Anelka isn&amp;#039;t a good lone striker because he&amp;#039;s not as strong as Drogba and isn&amp;#039;t as good in the air either.
