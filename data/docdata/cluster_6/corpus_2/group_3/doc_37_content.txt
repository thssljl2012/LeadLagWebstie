 That whole transfer saga was a mess. All the information surrounding it is pretty much undisclosed... Fraudlent misrepresentation is a big thing, but I would have thought Chelsea and Lyn would have dealt with this before, since it was so *bleep*ing complex, with Mikel signing a contract with Man Utd.  Chelsea are allowed to cancel Mikels contract for this, but have opted to go for a money...I would think the 16m signifies his Chelsea contract.
