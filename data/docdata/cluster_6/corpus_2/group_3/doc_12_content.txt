   quote   Stealth107       quote   ConkerASkyJockey      We need to get rid of O&amp;#039;Neill completely from our squad. The lad has done nothing but lose the ball too much.     He&amp;#039;s not a natural right winger though. He&amp;#039;s a central midfielder, and when he played there for us, was very impressive. Impressive enough for Liverpool to have a 5M bid rejected a few years ago in fact.    He plays in the center for us as well. Yet, just can&amp;#039;t deliver for us.
