   quote   Irish Gamer       quote   ConkerASkyJockey      Our wingers will shit all over Ferreira.      If Terry is fit Ivanovic will play right-back, if not then Ferreira will. If Joe Cole isn&amp;#039;t fit, Kalou will play       Hopefully.  I&amp;#039;ll be annoyed if Terry&amp;#039;s fit and Ferreira still plays right right.  Hopefully Ivanovic will get a game. He seems a good player.
