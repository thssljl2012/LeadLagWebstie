 There was Lennon&amp;#039;s shoulder barge with Griffin in the added time, there was another handball down the byline in the second half which wasn&amp;#039;t called up upon, wouldn&amp;#039;t have made a difference though. There the only two that are sticking in my mind at this monet, both of whom are to do with Griffin coincidently    Oh well, both wee penos, both were reds, although the ref is still shite.    You only watched 60 minutes also.   EDIT - Just seen the penalty appeal. It wasn&amp;#039;t. Gawd were shite.
