   quote   SuperCesc07       quote   D I O S     He&amp;#039;s *bleep*ing happy! You can&amp;#039;t start banning people for life for being happy! He&amp;#039;s not hurt any *bleep*ing person there give him a slap on the wrists maybe a fine, nothing more! And stop telling me when I can be angry or not, I was not angry before I saw your pig-ignorant post so I&amp;#039;m not taking it out on more than one (as us would imply) but you, for that ignorant, stupid post that shows little affection for any fellow fan at the time when we&amp;#039;re being downtrodden by major conglomerates. Don&amp;#039;t ever EVER tell me what I can and can not be annoyed at, when you are posting drivelous nonsense like that! And don&amp;#039;t try and pretend that your &amp;quot;belief&amp;quot; is driven by anything other than annoyance at the fact your team can&amp;#039;t *bleep*ing win either!   Arsenal have done more in about 2 years then in ur history mate!   You&amp;#039;ve won 4 FA Cups in two years? Jesus Christ, you are doing well!
