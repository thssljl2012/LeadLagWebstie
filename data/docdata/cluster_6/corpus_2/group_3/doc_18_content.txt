          the good thing about teams like portsmouth, spurs and even &amp;amp;quot;WE THINK WE ARE BIG&amp;amp;quot; newcastle, is that their mentality of trying to be a big club will mean that they will be easier to get points off then teams like stoke who only have the mentality of parking the bus. Sometimes I&amp;amp;#039;m more nervous about versing Hull then i am with portsmouth.
