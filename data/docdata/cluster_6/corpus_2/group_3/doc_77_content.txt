 Balague is awesome.    quote   WiLL Baxter 48     Match should be a good &amp;#039;un.  We&amp;#039;ll have to stop the runs from Ishmael Miller.  Well I don&amp;#039;t know, he just runs then misses...   Lol yeah, pretty much.  I&amp;#039;m interested to see who Mowbray puts out tonight, I&amp;#039;d say 4-5-1/4-3-3 and play on the break, probably Bednar up top. A few people calling for Moore to start after our recent lack of goals, he has the talent, shame about the attitude though.  Expect to lose tonight, Barton probably getting the winner.
