 Liverpool fans love Kuyt now ?       Glad with our 3-1 win ,  I was a bit pissed of because of our crappy start but we played some good stuff today without some key players. Hopefully they come back quicky cause our squad is too small to have these kinda injuries and good to see Diaby back , I expect him to be a starter once he regains full fitness tbh , hopefully he can push Eboue off the team unless Eboue goes back to RB till Sagna comes back.
