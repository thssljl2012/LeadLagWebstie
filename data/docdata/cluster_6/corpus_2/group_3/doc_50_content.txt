     quote  g_lfc    It was a great tackle. &amp;amp; I dont mean in the sense that Ronaldo got &amp;quot;hurt&amp;quot;. He won the ball, but went in with plenty of intent, I dont think there is anything wrong with it at all. Ronaldo&amp;#039;s antics are laughable really. Not to mention Ferdinand who fell for all those roles &amp;amp; screams.       Everything said there is correct
