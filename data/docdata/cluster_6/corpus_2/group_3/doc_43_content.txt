  Anyway, I&amp;#039;m going to take this time to laugh a number of spurs fans on here, mainly actually andy_jay for being so a silly twat. he thought it was hilarious when it continuously brought up the 5-1 last year, and was a whole debate, and then claimed he done it simply to &amp;#039;wind up the gooners&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;get a reaction&amp;#039; or something silly like that, and then went on a rampage against Cesc because he said Arsenal&amp;#039;s ladies could get a point of Spurs? What&amp;#039;s he doing? winding them up? getting a reaction? Yeah. So then you go about calling him a wee spanish *bleep*er and a terrible actor (good thing he&amp;#039;s a fantastic footballer then) and whatever else you did, despite doing  exactly  what you did. lol @ you sir, lol @ you.   Had to re-post that since nobody answered.
