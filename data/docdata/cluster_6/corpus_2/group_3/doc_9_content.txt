   quote   Felony     Are the Chelsea and Liverpool games really not on tv today? Seems quite strange to me.     Yeah i know usually Sky would snap up one game and Setanta would get the other or even Sky would get both of them and put them on back to back like Super Sunday. I was surprised when i found that out as well
