          Not to be taking Pompey lightly (I actually think that will be a tough game), but the next few League games make for a good reading and an opportunity to build on that 3-point gap with Chelsea.  After Pompey, we play ten more league games (5 at home , 5 away) until the New Year:  11/01- Tottenham (A) 11/08- West Brom (H) 11/15- Bolton (A) 11/22- Fulham (H) 12/01- West Ham (H) 12/06- Blackburn (A)  12/13- Hull (H) 12/21- Arsenal (A) 12/26- Bolton (H) 12/28- Newcastle (A)  Some may say that&amp;amp;#039;s looking too far ahead, that we have to take it each matrch as it comes but all this is just an overview of what we have ahead of us in our task of sustaining our form and protecting that 3-point gap with Chelsea. Some would see that and reckon it&amp;amp;#039;s a fairly easy run-in but it would be useless to beat the Uniteds and the Chelseas and then lose to the West Broms and Boltons.   30 points up for grabs. What would be the acceptable points haul for you?
