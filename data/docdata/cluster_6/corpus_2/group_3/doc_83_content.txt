   quote   Jmste     I&amp;#039;m glad that were not going to spend that much money, I only want 2 players anyway, Defoe &amp;amp; Diarra will do.     Diarra would be a great signing for Spurs if I&amp;#039;m honest, he&amp;#039;d be the perfect foil for Modric/Jenas in the middle. I watched him last night against Liverpool and even though it wasn&amp;#039;t a great performance by Pompey, I thought Diarra played quite well. Good tackler, energetic, confident on the ball and good turn of pace as well. If there&amp;#039;s one player I reckon Redknapp will want from Portsmouth, then it&amp;#039;ll be him.
