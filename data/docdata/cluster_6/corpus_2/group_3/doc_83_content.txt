   quote   LegendaryLegend      Arjen Robben anyone?  Lol.  The thing is, that the defences in Holland are rubbish. So strikers who bang goals in for fun tend to struggle when they come to the Prem and come up against some decent defenders.     If you&amp;#039;re saying that Arjen Robben was only good in the Dutch league, you need to watch him soon.  He was fantastic at Chelsea and Real Madrid. Quality winger. I didn&amp;#039;t want him to leave.
