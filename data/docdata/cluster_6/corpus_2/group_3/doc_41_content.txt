            Quote from: rushyman on September 22, 2008, 01:35:51 AM   If we got 13-15 points from that lot I&amp;amp;#039;ll suck a tramp off in the middle of my street and post it on youtube.    If Liverpool could win the next 1000 games 5-0 i would not even consider doing that... come on LFC you have to beat Pompey.... Do you spit or swallow?
