 Decent win for us (Man United) but we still haven&amp;#039;t hit form.  Ronaldo should have had a hattrick and we should have had 5 or 6. Thought once we went in the lead we were going to win and get a few more but obviously not. Thought the goal was a bit dubious and If I&amp;#039;m honest should have been a foul.  Berbatov is bone idol and a lazy bugger, and wants it fed to him on a plate. He doesn&amp;#039;t make many mistakes but he&amp;#039;s no Tevez.  Anyway, decent victory in which usually is a tough fixture. Only three points off the Pool now.
