   quote   Jmste       quote   Andy_Jay1987     As a  man city  fan, I also think Gomes is a bit of a clown, I mean seriously, Youngs goal?? wtf? that was like Robbo in disguise.  and let me ask this: when 2-0 down, why are we swapping strikers? seriously *bleep* management technique right there.    Fixed.         erm, what??? look, just because I live a mere 100 yards from Maine Road it dont make me a City fan, and my old sig was for a PES league, I&amp;#039;m not a City fan.     Wish I bloody was tho       BLOOOOO MOOOOOOOOON...........I mean, I mean, erm, Martin Jols blue and white army!!!  *bleep* it:   WHEN YOU WALK, THROUGH A STORM..............
