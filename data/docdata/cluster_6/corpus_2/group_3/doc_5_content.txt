   quote   turna08     Darren Bent and Pavlyuchenko upfront won&amp;#039;t work. I think Owen and Bent might though. Would be a good buy for you in January, even though he has been injury prone the last few years IF he stays fit he scores.   [/b]   I am fully aware Owen could leave in January, or at the very least move on next summer. However, I will happily bet large sums of money he won&amp;#039;t move to Spurs - the one team in a worse pickle than us.  We were doing okay until Keegan left, and then we collapsed. Spurs have just been diabolical from the beginning.
