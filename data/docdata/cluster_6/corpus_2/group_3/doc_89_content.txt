   quote   Jmste       quote   FLjungberg      Arsenal&amp;#039;s plan over the summer should have been selling Adebayor for 25 million and buying Amr Zaki for  4 .    I doubt they would have got him for that.      LOLZ    And on the note of Malouda, I think he is a really good player. Just hasn&amp;#039;t seemed to settle and get a decent run of games under his belt.
