          I&amp;amp;#039;m not saying its gonna be easy, but there&amp;amp;#039;s nothing in the next 6 games that should really worry us.   Apart from defoe Pompey dont really look a threat.  For all the hurrah about rednapp and spurs, they&amp;amp;#039;re still shite and will take more than beating Bolton to get them sorted out. Rednapp will do what he normally does and get them out of relegation trouble.  And we are in a much better position to beat the likes of WB etc. Not saying we deffo will, but there&amp;amp;#039;s no reason why we shouldnt. We have the squad to beat them.  During that 6 game run, the Mancs have to play hull (I think theyll batter Hull though), Arsenal away, Villa away, and City away. They have more opportunity for slipping up in that period then we do. Theoretically.  Chelsea have quite an easy run with Arse at home their only major obstacle that I can see.  Arse have the mancs at home, Villa at home, City away, and Chelsea away.  IF, and I know its a big if, but its certainly a longh way from impossible, we can win our games, then I can see us opening a nice little gap up over both Arse and the Mancs by Xmas.  Just in time to turn Arsenal over and put them out of the race for good.  The win yesterday sets us up for what could be a very good run of games. Pompey beaten, starts us on a run of games that with the other teams games, COULD leave us in a very good position come Chrimbo.
