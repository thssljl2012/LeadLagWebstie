  ^..  (to Skrtel going off injured)  Liverpool fans cheered as they would, some Man City fans clapped whilst other were booing, and probably some Man City fans clapping and booing...  I didn&amp;#039;t think I would ever say this but Anelka  and  Malouda both had one hell of a *bleep*ing game for us.. I couldn&amp;#039;t believe how well both of them were playing!.. Good result for us in a game we dominated well :].. Great to see Ballack getting closer to 100% and it was also great to watch Cole run up them wings as much as possible who I am starting to really enjoy more ever since Scolari come along :]
