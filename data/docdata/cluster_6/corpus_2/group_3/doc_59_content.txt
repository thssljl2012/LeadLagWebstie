   quote   _Chernaboug     I consider Ronaldos play-acting and players in general pretending that they&amp;#039;re hurt in order to win frees/get an opposing player sent off to be  far  more &amp;quot;prickish&amp;quot; an act than just kissing a badge.   Play acting serves to get you a freekick/penalty, kissing the badge in a gesture like rooney did serves to incite the fans. Rooney was pretty stupid in that case. If failure of fan control did emerge then everton would have a escape goat and point at rooney for needesly aggravating them.
