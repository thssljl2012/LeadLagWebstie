 How come football has the ability to ruin a perfectly good day out? I go to Bolton, I meet family, I meet friends, I have a few drinks and I chat, after the game went and had another few drinks in Salford (the nice bit not the shithole part) and came home on a nice, peaceful train. Yet the 90 minutes in between? UTTER SHITE! I should have stayed in the pub!
