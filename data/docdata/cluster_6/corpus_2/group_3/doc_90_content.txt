  I hope your trying to stay positive more than anything else because that comment is rather wierd. Big games are tight affairs, meaning forwards generally dont see alot of the ball. Micheal Owen has made a career out of turning up in matches at the most important times &amp;amp; scoring. Torres I think is alot better than that. He can hold the ball up well, which gives the defenders a restbite. He works hard &amp;amp; chases for every ball. But most importantly, in big games he always pops up with a goal. Scoring agaisnt Chelsea, Arsenal, Everton, Inter Milan to name the ones I can remember.   Also Id be very suprised if Kuyt plays through the middle.  I think he&amp;#039;ll stick to the same formation, pushing Keane up to play Torres&amp;#039;s role &amp;amp; Gerrard behind him like he done last year with Torres. Benitez loves Kuyt on the right, even moreso in big games, as his tendency to chase back, harry &amp;amp; pester the opposition whilst on the ball is key to Benitezs gameplan.
