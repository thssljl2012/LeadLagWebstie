Fubsy 1 - 4 Sentinel    Can&amp;#039;t head the ball, got frustated chasing players down the wing, and just got tackled wherever I went, some people i play I just can&amp;#039;t ge the ball off them : /      I forgot about that first goal, I was spamming  A to skip the reply, then that happened and I cba chasing your players down the wing time after time it was boring sd my full backs aren&amp;#039;t fast.  I conceeded two headers as well, so frustrating that the defenders CANNOT win headers if you are holding down sprint, which is what i was doing for both as I was constantly sprinting down the wing to &amp;amp;quot;try&amp;amp;quot; and catch your wingers.    lost my unbeaten run, gutted      and posibbly my chance to win the league gone completely now.
