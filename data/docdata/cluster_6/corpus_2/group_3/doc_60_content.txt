   quote   Jmste       quote   jonaldinho2004     Good finish by Delap, 2-1 to Stoke.  For a player signed for his creative influence, Luka Modric has offered absolutely nothing today. Shocking.   Oh be quite.  What do you expect in a team like this, he has played well so far, I think.   &amp;#039;A team like this&amp;#039; ? - you mean one packed with over 100m of talent ? Behave.  The amount of space he was given near the end of the first half by the Stoke midfielders, you would have thought he would be a lot more influential than what he has.   If Villa signed a player for that amount of money, the fans would be on his back to produce week in, week out.
