 Mourinho said he loves the Premier League so he&amp;#039;ll definitely come back once his contract is done with Inter, that&amp;#039;s not for another 3 years. I can definitely see him at United, and I for one wouldn&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;d make him less of a Chelsea legend, unless he reacts badly at the Bridge to something that goes against him (which, let&amp;#039;s be honest, could definitely happen).   Imo he&amp;#039;s just missing the attention from the English media so he says something to remind everyone he&amp;#039;s still about.
