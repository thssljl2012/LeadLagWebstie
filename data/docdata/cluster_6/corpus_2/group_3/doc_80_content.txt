  &amp;amp;quot;Barclays lost a lot of money in a few hours,&amp;amp;quot; said Dossena. &amp;amp;quot;We are talking about one of the most important banks, and the sponsor of the Premiership.      &amp;amp;quot;It is all difficult to understand.      &amp;amp;quot; Had I known about certain things before I would have thought twice (about moving to England ), I would have asked for more guarantees.      &amp;amp;quot; But I feel good at Liverpool and I chose to move abroad because it was the best financial offer.       &amp;amp;quot;Everything in England seemed secure, with the best organisation and club solidarity.      &amp;amp;quot;But then you discover that West Ham are at risk and may have to sell and the big banks are in serious debt.&amp;amp;quot;       Not a great way to endear yourself to the fans, especially when you&amp;#039;re as shite as Dossena is.
