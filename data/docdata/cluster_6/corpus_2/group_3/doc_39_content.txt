 I wouldn&amp;#039;t think less of him for going to United, what i meant was that if he goes to United and they play Chelsea, will he be able to keep his mouth shut if something goes against him. If he doesn&amp;#039;t he&amp;#039;ll loose a hell alot of respect from the Chelsea fans.  Now we&amp;#039;ve had Scolari, who plays attacking football, i don&amp;#039;t really want a manager like Mourinho, I think all the Chelsea fans are loving the attacking football with 5-0 wins too much to go back to boring football with 1-0s.
