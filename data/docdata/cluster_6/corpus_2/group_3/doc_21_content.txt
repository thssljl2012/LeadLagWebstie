            Quote from: blurred, please on October 10, 2008, 12:03:16 PM   I&amp;amp;#039;d&amp;amp;#039;ve thought he&amp;amp;#039;d actually look at the Madrid away game as a chance to rotate a bit - with 6 points already in the bag, and Chelsea on the horizon, I wouldn&amp;amp;#039;t be surprised to see one or two dropped for that to concentrate on the bigger game on the Sunday - if we lost in Madrid it wouldn&amp;amp;#039;t be the end of the world, as a win at home would see us both on 9 points and all but sure of both qualifying, whereas 3 dropped points to Chelsea is more key.
