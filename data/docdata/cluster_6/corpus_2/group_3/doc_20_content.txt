   quote   _Chernaboug     I&amp;#039;ll take the Arsenal fans&amp;#039; word on Clichy because I have to admit that I haven&amp;#039;t been watching many full Arsenal games as of late, just their win against West Ham a few days ago. I just don&amp;#039;t understand why Clichy tends to get lauded by the Arsenal fans instead of Sagna, who I can&amp;#039;t really recall ever having a bad game and is a more accomplished player.   I&amp;#039;ve lauded Sagna before, I think most Arsenal fans have. The thing is though, because Clichy gets forward well, he gets much more general recognition from people who watch the odd game, and thus he&amp;#039;ll stand out more and make more of an impression. Sagna is awesome in defence and works well overlapping on the wing.     quote   RobtheGooner       quote   DjedwardSmith     Another thing though, Spurs are in a great  infnaicla  position.   Lol, what a mother of a typo.    Lol, I came home from Uni for a bit of sleep as I was exhausted, and was touch typing and obviously didn&amp;#039;t notice it
