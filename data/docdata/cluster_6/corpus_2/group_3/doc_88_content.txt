   quote   g_lfc     It was a great tackle. &amp;amp; I dont mean in the sense that Ronaldo got &amp;quot;hurt&amp;quot;. He won the ball, but went in with plenty of intent, I dont think there is anything wrong with it at all. Ronaldo&amp;#039;s antics are laughable really. Not to mention Ferdinand who fell for all those roles &amp;amp; screams.    Fully agree. When I watched it at first, thought it was a good tackle. In slow mo it showed how great of a tackle it was. Timed to perfection, won the ball, nancy boy made a huge meal of it.  And Rooney goes on to show some of the prick-ish characteristics he still has. No respect.
