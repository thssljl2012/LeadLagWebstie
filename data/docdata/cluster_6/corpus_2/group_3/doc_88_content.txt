He wasn&amp;#039;t meant to. Michael Owen is our penalty taker and when he&amp;#039;s out, it&amp;#039;s Martins, however Joey Barton went straight up to the ball and wouldn&amp;#039;t give it to Oba.      Showed real courage, and I loved his celebration.                      firstly, if Oba was next in line then he should&amp;#039;ve taken it.     that much isn&amp;#039;t debatable.    secondly, that isn&amp;#039;t courage.    the guy is a scumbag. his definition of courage is beating people up.  he has no regard or understanding of the law, social ethics or the general health and safety of others.    he&amp;#039;s as anti-cohesion as one could be.    a pathetic excuse for a human being.    there&amp;#039;s no defending the guy. that much is obvious.    if you want to hero worship a scumbag like that then it&amp;#039;s your perogative. but it&amp;#039;s certainly nothing to be proud of or celebrated/promoted.    I&amp;#039;m not having a go at you and don&amp;#039;t mistake my tone but I just can&amp;#039;t stand violent people. he&amp;#039;s a repeat offender and has consistently displayed the traits of a really bad person.    that much is obvious when he plays on the football pitch.    the guy should **** off and go to jail.
