 great header to the thread    anyway  Wondergoal or not, this is ridiculous, every year we dole out points to the newly promoted sides, but the fact that we are bottom of the table is so much worse. Get rid of everyone from the manager up.   Havent said this since Christian Gross&amp;#039;s reign, but I could do a better job than this twat, never once did I criticise Jol.
