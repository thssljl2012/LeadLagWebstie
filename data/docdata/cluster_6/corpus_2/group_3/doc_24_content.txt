 Apparently this was on Wiki a bit back   On 27th September 2008 Rob Styles made what many would see as a mistake when he awarded a penalty to Manchester United, giving Manchester United the lead at Old Trafford in a Premier League match against Bolton. Jlloyd Samuel made a clean challenge of the ball where Ronaldo went down under impact of the ball and challenge. None of the Manchester United players appeared to even appeal for a penalty, yet Rob Styles pointed to the spot. TV replays clearly show a legal challenge by the Bolton defender. Ronaldo went onto dispatch the penalty and United won the game 2-0. However, the decision to award the penalty changed the game and could have been different if the penalty was not awarded.  No breath is being held in anticipation of an apology from the arrogant cock however.    Also guess what? He&amp;#039;s gonna be refereeing this weekend! After all it&amp;#039;s only Bolton, *bleep* &amp;#039;em!
