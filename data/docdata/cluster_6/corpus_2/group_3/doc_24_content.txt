   quote   Arsenal09       quote   Johnny Boi     Lol I love the sheer hatred of Ronaldo in here, perhaps his &amp;#039;body gestures&amp;#039; are not the same because he was rushed back from injury and is still not match fit? That would be my opinion anyway.  Liverpool are playing really well, to be fair, and deserve to be in the lead. Should be 2-0 as well, tbh, never a foul on Bosingwa by Gerrard, was a 2 on 1 from there. I hope Chelsea come back but I can see Liverpool hanging on here.      Why would people hate Ronaldo because he&amp;#039;s being forced to play somewhere where he clearly doesnt want to ?     Where&amp;#039;d he say that? :S
