            It&amp;#039;s like the league is saying &amp;amp;quot;you want a CBA that bennefits you? fine, we&amp;#039;ll get our money back from you in other ways&amp;amp;quot; It really seems more like an attempt to bring more revenue to the league than being truely concerned about the direction of the game. Pathetic.         &amp;amp;nbsp;                   Message Me About It                                                                                                                                  Kudos!
