   quote   Junior Messi     People laughed at me a month or ago for saying Ramos should go. Now people think the same. Funny old world isn&amp;#039;t it.    I&amp;#039;ll still say it now. You can&amp;#039;t blame Ramos as he is a good manager but you have to blame the players - They&amp;#039;re shite.
