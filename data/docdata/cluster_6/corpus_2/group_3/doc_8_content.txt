This is my #1 problem will this bid. People hear &amp;amp;quot;Barcelona&amp;amp;quot; and have these inflated expections and want to see a team of their childhood heroes and it&amp;#039;s just not going to happen. It honestly does not seem like the bidders, the Miami media, and especially a lot of Miami posters understand this league&amp;#039;s rules prevent the team from being mostly foreign.                      You guys do understand that by the time Miami Barca rolls around the changes to the CBA, the salary cap and the roster restrictions will make you all really just sound like HATERS.      Stop hating and join in. This is the one shot that MLS really has at being considered a REAL LEAGUE worldwide. Everyone knew that the Becks deal was all about the flash and now with him leaving its blowing up in the leagues face.      The Barcelona bid brings a level of seriousness that only they can provide.      So you say that they will play with 2nd or 3rd sting central and south americans? Sure no problem but the training and coaching staff will most likely be first rate and thats something that most teams can not buy. The tactical and strategical prowness that this team will possess will be beyond compare.      So like I said before you can hate or you can join in the fun!
