 Drogba has been playing well since he came back, was unbelievably unlucky not to score v Stoke, great save from Sorenson.  We&amp;#039;re playing some great stuff but so are Villa. They&amp;#039;ve been a bit of a bogey side for us in the past couple of seasons and I&amp;#039;m just not looking forward to it tbh.
