   They are a very good team.  They counter attack which may expose us because our full-backs go up but our full-backs got the pace to get back.  I hope Drogba starts scoring soon because it should help his confidence to score more. If we get Drogba scoring again we&amp;#039;ll be getting more goals.  Kalou and Malouda are both playing rather well too.   I can see us edging Aston Villa though.
