 Well i can&amp;#039;t believe that Liverpool have actually beaten Chelsea AWAY and the mancs at home. bad result for chelsea, but surely liverpool will have a say in the title race. Long way to go, but looking promising for the scousers atm.  On the subject West Ham v Arsenal i can&amp;#039;t belive wengers played denilson and bendtner ahead of Ade and Diaby! Also Silvestre is ahead of kolo, so it will be a very tricky game. Happy to see Sagna on the bench and Ramsey to finally be given a chance.  --------------My Pred: West Ham 1:2 Arsenal-----------------  EDIT: You see that the chelsea fan run on the pitch! Rofl
