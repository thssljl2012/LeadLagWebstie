 I feel dirty knowing SuperCesc cheers on the same team as I do, eww. Either way, I&amp;#039;m really, really, shocked at Spurs not winning. No offece to Stoke, but every time they play I expect them to lose and you&amp;#039;d think I&amp;#039;d learn from now, but I always get the feeling Spurs will win (thats not a jab, btw).  Alan Hutton is a brilliant player, I&amp;#039;d still take Sagna above him but he&amp;#039;s the only Spurs player who ever seems to try, with the exception of Lennon on occasion.  Oh btw, bai Ramos.
