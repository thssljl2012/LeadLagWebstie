   quote   The Shape     Oh and, the stoke/spurs game was fantastic to watch. I love it when people blame spurs&amp;#039; problems on their defence and their strikeforce (and their crying keeper now it seems) but seriously it&amp;#039;s the tamest midfield by far in the league, fairly obv. to most people here but still...and I insist that any side captained by Jermaine Jenas will never succeed at anything).   I wasn&amp;#039;t blaming the defence and strikers, i blamed the whole team for not performing.  I don&amp;#039;t care if Gomes was crying, I think most people would if you nearly broke your ribs in training and then get hit in the same spot about 5 times every time a throw/corner came in.
