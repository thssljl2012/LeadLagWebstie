   quote   Jmste     Stalteri, Rocha, Ghaly &amp;amp; Taarabt have all been given numbers now.    Good back-up players and Redknapp was impressed yesterday with them training.   Bring Ghaly back into midfield along side Jenas, with Modric just behind Pavvy, and Bentley and Lennon on the wings.  Tasty for now.
