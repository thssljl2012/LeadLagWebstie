   quote   JustCuzImIndie      Alan Hutton was scum today!  Deliberatly tried to injure stoke players at every opportunity he could.  First on Delap, lucky he missed him. Then on Sorensen, he caught him, and the spurs fans decided to boo Sorensen when he was clearly losing half the blood from his body via his head.    I don&amp;#039;t give a *bleep*.  At least he got stuck in today. Best player for us.  They booed him because the fans thought that your own player kicked Sorensen in the head.
