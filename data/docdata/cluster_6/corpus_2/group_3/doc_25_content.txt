   quote   LegendaryLegend     Well, he was alright. He makes a couple of good saves sometimes but i just find the guy hilarious. Stuff like what he did against Villa [was it?] when he saved Ashley Young&amp;#039;s [?] shot and it trickled in. And i remember him chasing someone around just inside the box lol he looked so stupid.  I love the guy lol. I didnt know wtf he was doing yesterday when he started screaming in pain with his ribs. Lol  I hope when we play Spurs we just chuck a shitload of crosses in. Because the guy obviously cant catch to save his life     Maybe because he nearly broke his ribs in training, clashed with Hutton and wasn&amp;#039;t suppose to start the game yesterday, but he did. He got hit into his ribs a few times, no wonder he was in pain.
