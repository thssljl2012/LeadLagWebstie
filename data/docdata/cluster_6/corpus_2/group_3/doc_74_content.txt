 With Fabregas possibly out were *bleep*ed.     Well here&amp;#039;s the team I would play :    Almunia  Sagna Gallas Toure Silvestre  Walcott Nasri Song  Clichy   RVP Ade      Silvestre should be fit as he played 90mins for our reserves and Clichy pace on the left could be a danger. Also I would prefer Nasri in middle rather than left since he is right footed , rest of the team was pretty obvious.   Have to say I have no idea how we&amp;#039;ll cope against Everton without Cesc , hopefully our two strikers will be on form for this one.
