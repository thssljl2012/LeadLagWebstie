            Quote from: gollne on  Today  at 06:13:00 AM   Some of those games will call for some Gerrard or Torres magic. One of them will need to hit top form for at least 5 games. Hopefully Babel can get some nice goals to not to mention  Kuyt  and Keane who are  yet to settle .   Kuyt yet to settle what? gambling debts? The question &amp;amp;quot;is there a god&amp;amp;quot;?&amp;amp;nbsp;
