   quote   RobtheGooner     lol yeah his acting is awful, but did you actually see &amp;quot;The Cesc Fabregas Show&amp;quot;? It wasn&amp;#039;t like that at all, it was like a big long interview with Cesc, his family and there were guests on it and stuff.  It was quite good . He had to do challenges aswell, there was a bit where this guy was booting the ball at him and he had to bring it under control within a little circle while Bendtner was telling the guy to &amp;quot;give him a really high one, in his face!&amp;quot;   No it wasnt. Only an idiot would enjoy it. Like soccer AM, utter shit since Tim, Sheephead, Fenners and Tramp left.
