A spurs side with no chance of qualifying for the Champions league next year might not meet his criteria&amp;amp;gt;    Confused here - what is the Champions League - is this the Barclays League or something different    I would find it hard to believe that Spurs are being relegated down a division?    So difference between Champions League and Barclays Premier - if any?    thanks - i like to know about English football though not a fan per se.
