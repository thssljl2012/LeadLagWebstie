 Im in 2 minds over the Beye tackle last night.  When i first saw it in real time, it looked like a definite penalty to me and i dont blame the ref for giving it.  But it was only in the slower, zoomed in replay that i noticed that Beye  only just  touched the ball.  Unless Styles can slow down the whole incident in his head and zoom in, and from another angle, i&amp;#039;m backing him.
