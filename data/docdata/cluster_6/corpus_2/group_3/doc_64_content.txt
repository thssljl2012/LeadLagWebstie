There will be changes to the CBA, but they will most likely be with a slight rise in salary cap and developmental contracts. We might see another DP slot or changes to the current one, but outside of that we&amp;#039;ll have the same restrictions on SIs. The idea of having a mostly Hispanic team is just that, an idea. Reality of MLS is far different of what Barca thinks it will have.                      My dream becoming reality has nothing to do with this Miami Bid.      Raising the cap from 2.3 to 3.5 which seems a reasonable enough lift for 2009 and then the addition of a DP slot or the lifting of the salary cap hit of 400k for DP&amp;#039;s is probably enough to raise the level of play considerably. And these increases are just for 2009 ALONE.      Come 2010 or even 2011, the changing of the CBA along with more salary cap increases will eventually take the league on the path that its fans would like it to be on.     I&amp;#039;m not looking for a copy of the EPL. God no!! But it would be really nice for the league to finally start walking down the path to fulfill its promise of a top flight league.
