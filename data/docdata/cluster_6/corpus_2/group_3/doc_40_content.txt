            Quote from: nowum on  Yesterday  at 12:44:19 PM   In all honesty, we&amp;amp;#039;ve not troubled Chelsea for years down there.I just can&amp;amp;#039;t see it this year either.    We were the better side last year and I remain convinced that we would have won if Torres had been fit. We had loads of possession and chances but just lacked someone on the day to finish.
