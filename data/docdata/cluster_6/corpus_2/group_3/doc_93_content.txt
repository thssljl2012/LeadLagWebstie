 The win at Chelsea is worthless if they don&amp;#039;t go and beat Pompey on Wednesday. Like when they beat the Mancs at home, they went and dropped two points against a side they should have turned over. It just puts that draw against Stoke into perspective. What, 6 point lead at the top? Although, by beating the top two teams in Europe within 2 months, that will give them a huge confidence boost for Pompey, Spurs, etc.    This message was edited by Will on Oct 27 2008.
