 Any predictions for the Chelsea v Liverpool game this weekend?  I&amp;#039;m goin for a 2-1 win to Chelsea  Also something that&amp;#039;s been pestering me is that Big Phil keeps on calling Chelsea &amp;quot;ChelseAA&amp;quot; why isn&amp;#039;t anybody correcting him and tell him that it&amp;#039;s just Chelsea.
