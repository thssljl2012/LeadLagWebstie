 Setanta Extra  has both Wednesday and Saturday&amp;#039;s matches listed as Live:       Wed 29 Oct  03:30 pm  LIVE Barclays Premier League - Arsenal vs Tottenham Hotspur (KO 4 pm)      Sat 01 Nov  10:30 am  LIVE Barclays Premier League - Stoke City vs Arsenal (KO 11:00)       I think this is a change for the Stoke game especially, as it was originally supposed to be on delay on FSC.
