Defender Jonathan Woodgate is the latest injury concern ahead of Tottenhams Barclays Premier League clash against Bolton after being substituted against Udinese with an apparent groin problem. Captain Ledley King struggles to play twice a week so is expected to miss out, Tom Huddlestone has been out with a knee complaint and Michael Dawson and Gareth Bale are suspended. Vedran Corluka (head) and Roman Pavlyuchenko (ankle) were ineligible for European duty but will need checks before returning against Bolton. Provisional squad: Gomes, Cesar, Hutton, Gilberto, Gunter, Corluka, King, Assou-Ekotto, Woodgate, Zokora, Bentley, Huddlestone, Lennon, Modric, OHara, Pavlyuchenko, Bent, Giovani, Campbell.
