 claims winning the Ballon d'Or would be like reaching the peak of Mount Everest. The Spanish ace is tipped as a contender for the accolade - which is also known as European Footballer of the Year - after netting 33 goals in the Barclays Premier League last term. The odds on Torres beating the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in December shortened significantly after his winner for Spain in the European Championship final. 'When I have watched the Ballon d'Or presentation on television I saw the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldinho and Kaka,' said the striker. 'I told myself that trophy was for players from another galaxy. Now I am among the candidates, and I cannot believe it. 'Winning the award would be like climbing to the top of Everest and touching the sky.' Torres also expressed his joy at playing for Liverpool, adding: 'I am at ease in England. I wanted to play there so strongly, to discover the Premier League. 'At Liverpool I have started a second life. It is great.'
