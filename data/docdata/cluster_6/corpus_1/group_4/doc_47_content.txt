EMANUEL Pogatetz is determined to make sure his former club-mate Ayegbeni Yakubu does not end his nine-match goal drought against Middlesbrough on Sunday.  The Nigerian striker has been declared fit to line up against his old team after shaking off a heel injury ahead of the Barclays Premier League clash at Goodison Park.  Few players know the threat posed by Yakubu better than Pogatetz, who has retai  ned a close friendship with the 26-year-old, who moved to Everton from Boro for 11.25million in August 2007.  'When Yak was here I got on really well with him because he was a really positive influence,' said the Middlesbrough captain.  'He's a good friend of mine and I follow his progress very closely. We know what his strengths are and we will really have to work together as a back four to stop him scoring.  'I think his pace is one of his strengths and it's hard to stop him and we all know about his finishing qualities so we really have to be on our toes.  'I'm not really looking forward to the challenge ?of marking him? because I know he's a very good player.  'Everyone knows he's been one of the top goalscorers in England over the last couple of years so it will be tough. But hopefully I can get on top of him and our team will beat his.'  The Austria international knows Yakubu had a habit of scoring his goals in prolific bursts and so after a nine-match drought the striker is due one.  'He sometimes goes without scoring for a few games then he gets one and goes on a run scoring seven or eight on the bounce,' he added.  'He did a great job for us when he was in our team but he does go a few games when he doesn't score and hopefully that will continue against us. Hopefully he won't end his run against us.'
