HARINGEY Borough travel to Kingsbury London Tigers for an important Spartan South Midlands Premier Division clash on Saturday.   Borough, battling to avoid the drop, earned a 1-1 draw with fellow strugglers Holmer Green at the weekend.   The weather reduced the last third of the match to something of a lottery, the ball getting stuck in the mud and puddles.   Borough got off to a dream start, Fabian Brown scoring within the first minute.   But the visitors equalised on the half-hour and neither side could grab a much-needed winner. A 'violent character' has been jailed for ten years for suffocating a man in Tottenham.   Roads blighted by rat-running are to be made safer with a reduced speed limit.   A theatre in Highgate may have to cut up-and-coming talent from its programme if new funding is not approved.   WEST HAM reserves return to Barclays Premier Reserve League South action with a short trip across London to face Tottenham Hotspur at Leyton Orient.
