Nyron Nosworthy joined two Premier League referees to promote the game's Respect campaign. The Sunderland defender joined top-flight refs Howard Webb and Mike Riley to host a referee masterclass with children at the Washington Millennium Centre Barclays Spaces for Sports site.  Mr Webb and Mr Riley took 45 children aged 11-15 through a refereeing programme as part of the Barclays grassroots initiative, the second of four regional events to promote the Premier League's 'Get on with the Game' campaign. Professional coaches also took the children through a coaching session to reinforce the Premier League's Respect message, which was followed by a Q&amp;amp;A and autograph session with Nosworthy and the referees. 'The 'Get on with the Game' programme is a really positive move for the Premier League,' said Mr Webb. 'But influencing children at a young age is just as important as they are the future players and fans. 'The Barclays events will introduce the notion of getting on with the ref in a fun environment, but having the support from the club and players, will have a huge impact on the children. 'I look forward to refereeing the stars of the future!'
