Michael Collins was the hero at Elland Road as he popped up to fire in a 90th-minute winner after Robert Snodgrass had given Leeds a 4th-minute lead. Joe Skarz had equalised within 35 seconds of the restart after half time.  In the Championship it was a bad day for the two Sheffield clubs as United were beaten 2-0 at home to promotion rivals Reading and Wednesday were thumped 3-0 at fast-improving Derby.  The Blades found themselves two down by half-time as Kalifa Cisse and Kevin Doyle found the net while the Owls never looked like getting anything from their trip to Pride Park.   It was left for Barnsley to get some points on the board as they battled back from a goal down against managerless Watford to secure an impressive victory.  Two goals in the space of three second-half minutes from Manuel Mostto and Stephen Foster were enough to kill off the Hornets.  It was a disappointing day for both Bradford and Rotherham in League Two as the Bantams went down 1-0 to a 70th-minute strike at Wycombe Wanderers and the Millers were soundly beaten 4-0 at Gillingham.  York were also beaten in the Blue Square Conference as they went down 2-1 to Torquay thanks to a last-minute winner.
