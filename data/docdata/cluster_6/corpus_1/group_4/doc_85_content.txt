Liverpool can expect to have their big guns back for the Barclays Premier League trip to Bolton.  Boss Rafael Benitez retained only Daniel Agger from the side that beat West Brom last weekend for the Carling Cup defeat at Spurs on Wednesday.  But Jose Reina, Jamie Carragher, Javier Mascherano, Steven Gerrard, Dirk Kuyt, Robbie Keane and Xabi Alonso are expected to play at the Reebok.  Full-back Philipp Degan picked up a foot injury at White Hart Lane, while Jermaine Pennant is unlikely to figure after being left out of the last two squads.  Provisional squad: Reina, Arbeloa, Carragher, Agger, Aurelio, Gerrard, Alonso, Mascherano, Riera, Kuyt, Torres, Keane, Cavalieri, Hyypia, Benayoun, Babel, Lucas, Dossena, El Zhar.
