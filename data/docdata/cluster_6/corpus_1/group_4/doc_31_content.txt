MIDDLESBROUGH manager Gareth Southgate has praised the performances produced by Ross Turnbull in recent weeks which have vindicated the decision not to sign a replacement for Mark Schwarzer.  The 23-year-old goalkeeper produced a superb double save from Lee Bowyer and Jack Collison in the final minute of Boro's 1-1 draw with West Ham on Saturday to secure a point for Southgate's side.  Turnbull, who has risen through the youth ranks to the first team, was commanding throughout the Barclays Premier League encounter with the Hammers and the Boro boss has been impressed by the way he has played after having five goals put past him by Chelsea.  'Ross has shown a lot of character to respond after the Chelsea match, although I didn't think he was particularly at fault for any of the goals in that game,' Southgate said.  'There was one where he would have thought he made a mistake but I don't think he was to blame for the result at all.  'But you never know how that sort of scoreline will affect a young goalkeeper. I thought it was really important that we did keep him in after that game to see how he responded  'We had faith him so I didn't think his performance in that game particularly warranted dropping him. And in the last three games he has been outstanding and performed incredibly well.  'I'm delighted for him and it gives the team confidence. The defence are doing well but it's good for them to know they've got a goalkeeper making saves behind them.  'They are not just good saves but match-winning or point-winning saves.'  Southgate now hopes Boro can build on the weekend's performance by getting a result at Aston Villa this Saturday.
