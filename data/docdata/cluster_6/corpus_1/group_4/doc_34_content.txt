Robbie Keane gave Rafael Benitez his 150th victory as Liverpool boss as the Anfield club moved back to the top of the Barclays Premier League.  Keane's two goals helped secure a 3-0 win for Liverpool against West Bromwich Albion.  Liverpool have now beaten West Brom in their last ten meetings and wiped away the memory of losing their unbeaten record at Spurs last weekend.  Fernando Torres made his return after a six-game absence with a hamstring injury, but initially only as far as the bench.  Benitez rested midfielder Xabi Alonso to the bench and brought in Yossi Benayoun as the only change from the side that drew with Atletico Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday.  Liverpool had to wait until the final minute for their third, when full-back Arbeloa cut in from the right to fire into the top corner.
