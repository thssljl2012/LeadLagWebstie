Manager Gareth Southgate is ready to name an unchanged Middlesbrough side for Sundays Barclays Premier League trip to Everton.  With top scorer Mido struggling to overcome a frustrating groin injury and Justin Hoyte impressing at right-back in last weekends 2-1 win at Aston Villa, the Boro boss has no compelling reasons to shuffle his pack.  That would mean David Wheater making do with a place on the bench for the second match running, which could seriously hamper his hopes of winning an England call-up ahead of Wednesdays friendly in Germany.  Team (from): Turnbull, Hoyte, Taylor, Riggott, Pogatetz, ONeil, Digard, Aliadiere, Downing, Tuncay, Alves, Jones, Wheater, Grounds, Arca, Walker, Johnson A, Emnes.
