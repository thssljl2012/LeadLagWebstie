JAMIE CARRAGHER has demanded an instant return to winning ways as Liverpool negotiate what he views as an increasingly unforgiving Barclays Premier League title race.  They slipped off the summit of the table with their 2-1 defeat at White Hart Lane on Saturday, Carraghers own goal letting Tottenham back into the match.  Chelsea responded to last weekends home defeat to Liverpool by putting eight goals past Hull and Sunderland and Carragher wants a similar response from his team-mates. Look how Chelsea have reacted since we beat them and how Manchester United reacted when they lost to us, he said. Theyve been on a great run since. Its how you come back from your setbacks that counts. This will be a test for us now. If you want to show youre championship contenders its how you bounce back that matters. Before Jose Mourinho came to Chelsea you could get away with losing five or six but now it seems to be three or four. The standards are so high. You cant afford to lose too many.
