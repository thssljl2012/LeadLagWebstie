         Countrywide may have made the same mistake Enron finally did.  Not content with screwing the general public, they may have gone after the deep pockets and screwed a few of the major corps and their shareholders.  You can screw old John Q until the cows come home but you do NOT %$#^ with the Wall Street turdminions.     FBI Goes After Management Thugs At Countrywide (CFC), Bank Of America Deal May Be Troubled                  Quote:              The FBI is looking into whether Countrywide (NYSE: CFC) committed securities fraud by making false statements about the mortgage bank's financial position.        The Wall Street Journal writes that a "potential issue facing the company is whether it has been candid in its accounting for losses. People familiar with the matter said that Countrywide's losses may be several times greater than it has disclosed."                         Quote:              The disclosure of the FBI probe is likely to push shares lower. If new, significant losses have to be reported, the price may well go to zero.            I would hope to see every damned one of 'em in jail.  If it doesn't happen, then don't EVER talk to me about justice in this country again.
