    THE PROBLEMS: Citigroup stock falls below $1 a share    AP Thursday March 5, 2009 11:37 am ET    Citigroup stock drops below $1 a share, relaxed NYSE rule  allows continued trading    CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (AP) -- Shares of Citigroup Inc.,  once the most powerful U.S. bank, fell below $1 a share  Thursday.    The stock fell to 98 cents in late morning trading, down  15 cents or 14.2 percent from Wednesday.      New York-based Citi has lost more than 85 percent of its  value so far this year, and is down more than 95 percent  from a year ago as the bank was pummeled by the financial  market crisis.    Citigroup's shares will remain on the New York Stock  Exchange. Last week, the NYSE relaxed its listing rules  to allow stocks that fall under $1 to still be listed and  traded on the exchange.    The exchange said the change was warranted given the  "current period of unusual market volatility and decline."  Ordinarily, an NYSE-listed company's shares cannot remain  below $1 for more than 30 consecutive days. If that happens,  the company gets about six months to prove to the NYSE it  can boost its stock price.    As the recession deepens, the problems facing Citigroup --  souring loans and the impact of the recession -- are only  getting worse.

Friday's agreement shows how hard the Obama administration  is trying to stabilize the U.S. banking industry without a  full-fledged nationalization that would wipe out investors  and leave the government in charge. But the deal will punish  existing shareholders of Citigroup, who will see their stake  diluted by 74%, and likely do little to change the awkward  relationship between federal officials and management of the  New York company.

Citigroup, after suffering a loss of $8.29 billion, its fifth  straight quarterly deficit, is reorganizing into Citicorp and  Citi Holdings.
