 March 2 (Bloomberg) -- Bankers underwriting share sales in 2008 often found themselves touting a familiar stock -- their own. Look for a repeat in 2009.  Urgently needing to raise capital after taking more than $1 trillion in writedowns and provisions, financial firms dominated equity sales in a down year. Fees slumped 57 percent to $11 billion from $25.7 billion in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bankers expect this year to be little improved, even as financial companies continue to rebuild their balance sheets.   ....  Financial firms made up 12 of the 20 biggest equity deals, with many serving as underwriters for their own offerings. Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Bank of America and JPMorgan all waded into the secondary market last year, with Bank of America participating in its own deal and Wells Fargos Wachovia Corp. unit handling part of its offering.    http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=awJ...
