-from link above...   ================================       Socit Gnrale (France)      Goldman Sachs (GS, Fortune 500)      Merrill Lynch International      Deutsche Bank (Germany)      Calyon, Crdit Agricole (France)      UBS (Switzerland)      Barclays (England)      Coral Purchasing, DZ Bank (Germany)      Bank of Montreal (Canada)      Rabobank (the Netherlands)      Royal Bank of Scotland      Bank of America      Wachovia      HSBC (England)      Barclays Global Investors          What is the significance of the rank order of the list? Since it is not alphabetical, one possible interpretation is that the banks are listed in order of the amount of CDOs they insured with AIG.       Goldman Sachs' No. 2 position fits several press reports that it was an important counterparty, perhaps having insured $20 billion of CDOs with AIG. Goldman has never confirmed that figure, but it has said that its "net" exposure to AIG - after collateral it received and hedging it did - was minimal.      If indeed France's Socit Gnrale ranks No. 1 by exposure, it's a distinction the bank certainly didn't need. Early last year, the company was staggered by the news that a rogue trader had lost $7.5 billion. Had a domino effect ensued from AIG's collapse, Socit Gnrale would have been in an especially vulnerable position.      The Fed's Kohn admitted in the Senate hearings that paying off these counterparties in the course of the AIG rescue "will reduce their incentive to be careful in the future," which helps explain why the names have become such sought-after information in the political debate over "moral hazard."      A transcript of Thursday's hearings that was done by Congressional Quarterly contains a typo that nicely describes the whole disastrous mess that AIG has turned out to be for U.S. taxpayers. The speaker was New York superintendent of insurance Eric Dinallo, and what he said was, "AIG is a microcosm of our regulatory regime."       But the transcript says not "microcosm," but "microchasm." And that's what AIG has proved to be, a money pit of gaping proportions.       First Published: March 7, 2009: 1:18 PM ET
