Without complete disclosures of all past GIC and Temasek investments, it is difficult to assess which areas of investments were successful and which were failures.        I think in the past, the government had been very conservative in its overseas investments:  US treasury notes, gold, currencies and a small exposure to equities.  Just guessing.         I also think it was in recent years and particularly in 2008 that they went in big on equities.  The investments in Citibank, UBS and other big financial firms are public knowledge.        So, it is difficult to compare past performances with recent ones.  Anyway, we are already in.  Just have to hold and hope for the best.
