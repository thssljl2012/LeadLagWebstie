Hi Rick,      AIG ($1.1 trillion assets and 74 million clients in 130 countries) receives an $85 billion Federal Reserve loan in return for relinquishing 79.9% percent ownership in the company.      FHFA (Federal Housing Finance Agency) places Fannie Mae (with Herb Allison of TIAA-CREF) and Freddie Mac (with David Moffett of U.S. Bancorp) into conservatorship - dividends on both the common and preferred shares will be eliminated. Interest and principal payments will continue to their companies' securitized bonds and subordinated debt. The Treasury will 'backstop' both agencies with up to $100 billion (each) of a special class of stock - the Treasury through senior preferred stock and warrants will own 79.9% of each agency. Their portfolios "shall not exceed $850 billion as of 12/31/09, and shall decline by 10% per year until they reach $250 billion" - Fannie's is $758 billion and Freddie's is $798 billion.       EESA/TARP invests in 470 banks (3/20) with preferred stock (5% dividend for the first 5% years and then convert to 9%), warrants (right to buy common stock equal to 15% of the total investment in the firm) and compensation limitations:      Citigroup Inc New York $45 billion   Bank of America Corp North Carolina $45 billion   Wells Fargo &amp; Co California $25 billion   J.P.
