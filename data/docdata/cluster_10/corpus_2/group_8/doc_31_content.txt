But good news, his pay is being reduced to only $9.6 MILLION  for 2008 and he gets it ALL today          Geez people ... wake the HELL UP!!!         :)                Bank of America Reduces Pay to CEO Lewis by 60% (Update1)                     By David Mildenberg               March 2 (Bloomberg) --    Bank of America Corp.   , the largest U.S. bank by assets, reduced Chief Executive Officer    Kenneth Lewis   s total compensation in 2008 by 60 percent to $9.96 million after the company missed performance targets.     The package included $1.5 million in salary, unchanged since 2001, and no bonus or stock options based on 2008 performance, according to a federal    filing    today by the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank. Lewis, 61, had total 2007    compensation    of $24.8 million under Securities and Exchange Commission reporting rules.     Regardless of our profitability and continued progress and growth, our performance did not meet our expectations, including a loss for the fourth quarter, the companys compensation and benefits committee said.     Bank of America    declined    about 66 percent in market value last year and reported its first quarterly loss in 17 years, prompting some analysts and investors to speculate that Lewis may be ousted.    Temple Sloan   , the banks lead independent director, on Jan. 28 issued a statement supporting Lewis and his team, citing their experience in managing through challenging environments and in assimilating mergers.     Lewiss $9.96 million in compensation included $7.4 million in restricted stock and stock options expensed last year and based on performance from 2005 through 2007. The exercise price of the options ranges from $40.78 to $53.85 a share, compared with the banks current $3.63 stock price.     Executive Pay     Three senior Bank of America executives received $800,000 salaries last year, unchanged from the previous year. Chief Financial Officer    Joe Price   ,    Barbara Desoer   , head of the mortgage, home equity and insurance unit, and    Liam McGee   , head of the consumer and small business bank, didnt receive cash bonuses or stock options for last year.     The trend is certainly a decline in compensation and an attempt to try to pay for performance, said    Frank Glassner   , chief executive officer of San Francisco-based Compensation Design Group. Anyone who accepts a bonus in a period in which a company performs so poorly would have to be saying, Let them eat cake.        Lewiss compensation included $220,267 for use of Bank of Americas corporate jets, $18,401 for tax preparation and financial planning and $13,791 for home security and secured parking.        Corporate Jets     CEO use of corporate jets has drawn criticism from U.S. lawmakers as the government props up banks. The U.S. Treasury has provided $45 billion to Bank of America. Lewis last month took a train to Washington from New York before appearing at a congressional hearing.        Bruce Hammonds   ,  who retired on Dec. 31 after heading the companys credit-card business, received a $6.8 million payment in January to replace a previous retention agreement following Bank of Americas 2006 acquisition of MBNA. Hammonds had been CEO of MBNA.      The annual proxy statement includes eight stockholder proposals that are opposed by the banks board. Among those are a request that shareholders have a nonbinding vote on compensation to executive officers, best known as say on pay. Eight companies have agreed to such a plan, including    Verizon Communications Inc.        Another shareholder proposal, offered by the Service Employees International Union, would require the bank to split the role of chief executive officer and chairman. The board believes that we are currently best serviced by having Mr. Lewis hold both of these positions, according to the proxy.        Bank of America    declined 32 cents, or 8.1 percent to $3.63 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
