So Citigroup announced it has an operating profit through 2 months.  Two questions came to mind when I saw this announcement:      1. Why would Citigroup make an announcement based on 2 months of data, and say "we've got an operating profit before taxes, writedowns, and other stuff?"  Are taxes and writedowns going to be materially large enough to wipe out the operating profit?  [Pandit didn't answer this question from what I understand.]  If so, does it really matter whether Citi has an operating profit?      2. Did Citigroup   not   have an operating profit in Q4, 2007 and for all of 2008?  If not, what exactly constitutes operating profit [which I have always assumed was the profit  before  taxes, writedowns, and other one-time charges], what's going on to cause an operating profit through two (2) months of 2009, and what reason do investors have to believe this is something that's going to continue going forward?      I just found it odd that Citi would make a big splash about having an operating profit in the first two months of this year [as opposed to waiting until the end of the quarter], and not disclose details on any of the items that would offset it.  Perhaps there's real legs to the  WSJ article about yet another potential rescue of Citibank  and the press release from Citi was nothing more than an attempt to jawbone the stock price and restore confidence in an attempt to avoid that rescue.
