                                              Merrill Men Paid Over $10 Million Subpoenaed     By SUSANNE CRAIG and DAN FITZPATRICK  New York state&#039;s attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, has issued subpoenas to several top Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. executives who were each paid more than $10 million in cash and stock last year, according to people familiar with the situation.  The executives include Andrea Orcel, the top investment banker at Merrill, global sales and trading chief Thomas Montag and Peter Kraus, Merrill&#039;s former head of strategy.  Messrs. Orcel and Montag now work at Bank of America Corp., which acquired Merrill in January. Mr. Kraus is chief executive of investment-management firm AllianceBernstein Holding LP. They were paid more than $25 million apiece in 2008.  General Andrew Cuomo has issued subpoenas to several top Merrill Lynch executives In its waning days as a stand-alone company, Merrill paid out billions of dollars in bonuses, even though it wound up posting a fourth-quarter net loss of $15.84 billion. For all of 2008, the 10 highest-paid Merrill executives got a total of $209 million, and 11 were paid more than $10 million each according to people familiar with the situation. Merrill posted a net loss of $27.6 billion.  Late Wednesday, BofA filed a petition in New York state court to keep the pay data confidential.  Mr. Cuomo is investigating whether the bonuses violated securities laws. He is concerned that BofA and Merrill didn&#039;t disclose, when the takeover deal was reached in September, their agreement to a bonus payout of as much as $5.8 billion, according to people familiar with the investigation. Mr. Cuomo also is scrutinizing the Charlotte, N.C., bank&#039;s role in setting bonuses of several Merrill executives.  As part of the inquiry, Mr. Cuomo&#039;s investigators took testimony Wednesday from Steele Alphin, BofA&#039;s chief administrative officer. Chairman Kenneth Lewis, who met with investigators last week, has said he had "no authority" over Merrill&#039;s bonuses.  Separately, longtime BofA director Meredith Spangler said she won&#039;t stand for re-election at this spring&#039;s annual meeting, ending a 21-year run on the board. Ms. Spangler, who joined Bank of America predecessor NCNB Corp. as a director in 1988, is the wife of Dick Spangler, the bank&#039;s largest single shareholder.  Ms. Spangler turns 72 years old on April 15. Company policy dictates that directors have to step down at that age, she said.
