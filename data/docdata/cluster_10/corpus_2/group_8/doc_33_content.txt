They were part of the cash infusion into the 2008 Senior Convertible Note offering!! CASH!!! For that they got a NOTE, that NOTE was convertible to common stock at .01 per share IF they so selected. Any financier knows if they convert a note it dilutes the common shareholder, then now included and ultimately the price will fall!! A prime example is AIG, Citibank and any other of the TARP fund receiving companies!!
