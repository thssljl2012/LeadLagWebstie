         From the SHLD Yahoo! finance message board, original poster did not credit source:        In the wake of that news, Mr. Ackman employed some financial wizardry that looked smart at the time. Wanting to protect his tax-exempt investors from a Canadian tax bite, he entered a complex derivative transaction with a U.S. bank. The U.S. bank turned around and entered into a similar deal with a Canadian bank. It wasn't an unusual transaction; other hedge funds in similar situations did the same thing. The upshot was that, for a fee, Mr. Ackman retained the same economic interest in the stock but no longer had the ability to vote the shares.There was a mysterious paragraph in the release saying Sears had reached an agreement with "certain shareholders" whereby they would commit to vote shares in favor of Mr. Lampert in December. But the bid expires in August. Why would it take until December? Where were the mystery shares coming from? What investor would take C$18 in December, when it could sell for more on the open market today?        The answer may go back to the Ackman derivatives transaction from last December. In all likelihood, Mr. Ackman's tax strategy ended up providing Mr. Lampert the tool to outmaneuver him.        The Canadian bank ultimately on the other side of the Ackman transaction, Scotiabank, reached the agreement with Sears, pledging 4.5 million shares to back the deal at C$18.Aside from the legitimate questions about Scotia's involvement, Mr. Ackman also seems a victim of his own cleverness. By entering into the swap, he lost control of the voting rights that could have helped him push for a better buyout price. One lesson is that long-term activists may need to take full, unadulterated ownership to keep the voting power. When he became an activist on McDonald's, Mr. Ackman had some shares and some options. Options don't have voting power, and that became a cudgel that McDonald's used to undermine his activist arguments.        In this case, it looks like Mr. Ackman was outmaneuvered by Mr. Lampert.
