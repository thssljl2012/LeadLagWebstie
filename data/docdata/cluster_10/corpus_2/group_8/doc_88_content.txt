      The AIG bonuses pale in comparison to Merrill Lynch's $2.5 billion.     http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/21/bu...21merrill.html          quote:                     Tax Would Not Cover $2.5 Billion in Merrill Bonuses     By LOUISE STORY  Published: March 20, 2009    Merrill Lynch&#8217;s $3.6 billion bonus pool has been among the most controversial payouts on Wall Street. But most of those bonuses, which included some 700 awards of over $1 million, would not be affected by a new bonus tax being considered in Congress.    The tax, which passed in the House on Thursday, would affect only bonuses paid during 2009. Typically, Merrill&#8217;s bonuses are paid in January, along with the rest of Wall Street&#8217;s. But the investment bank pushed $2.5 billion of the bonuses out the door in December in advance of its merger with Bank of America.    ...    Merrill&#8217;s bonuses have spurred controversy because of the  $15.8 billion loss the firm took in the fourth quarter  and because they were paid earlier than usual. Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general of New York, is investigating Merrill&#8217;s bonuses and its merger with Bank of America.    Some of the biggest winners in Merrill&#8217;s bonus pool stand to lose a lot if the tax bill is changed to cover their payouts. Even if Congress settles on a 50 percent tax of the bonuses, the dollar values are eye-popping. For instance,  Thomas K. Montag, who now heads capital markets at Bank of America, was promised a bonus of nearly $40 million when he joined Merrill after a career at Goldman Sachs.     Some Wall Street executives may have already spent some of their bonus money.  Peter Kraus, another Merrill executive who is now the chief of AllianceBernstein, received $25 million for his work at Merrill, and purchased a $37 million apartment last fall.
