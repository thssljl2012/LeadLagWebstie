          http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idINN1554425220090115?rpc=44         Merill Lynch CEO John Thain in deep crap .Apparently Merrill Lynch is being suspected of under reporting unexpected losses .Sounds like sizzling books to me .        This ticked off Bank of America who basically stepped in to bailout Merrill with a merger of sorts .The deal could be in jeopordy .        Then I see where Merrill proceeded with bonuses and let Thain spend a million dollars on an office  ?        But have no fear Anne Reese is hear .On the auditing committees of Merrill Lynch and SHLD .So the Merrill Auditing committee misses the Merrill mortgage meltdown and now they miss another 15 BILLION in losses .All aided and abetted by professional pens and the likes of Anne Reese -board of director member for SHLD and Merrill .         http://www.retail-worker.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8979
