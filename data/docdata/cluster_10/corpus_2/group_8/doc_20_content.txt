 FT: Citi Close to Govt Deal; Debating Nationalization          February 24, 2009, 2:54 pm          FT: Citi Close to Govt Deal; Debating Nationalization        Posted by Tiernan Ray            The  Financial Times  this afternoon reports  that  Citigroup  ( C ) is close to a deal with the U.S. government that would a 40% stake in the firm,  as an article in The Wall Street Journal this weekend suggested . Citing people close to the situation, the article says the government would convert some of its $45 billion in preferred shares of Citi to common stock, as would sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, which hold about $30 billion of preferreds. The article says that talks between Citi and U.S. Treasury Department officials made progress since the weekend. The article says the price of conversion of shares, have not been finalized. The FT says an announcement could come as soon as Wednesday or Thursday.       And in a related article , the FT says that competitors of Citis are urging the government to put fetters on the firms proprietary trading, prime brokerage, and its derivatives businesses in conjunction with any massive investment. Rivals argue that Citi must not be given undue power in financial markets, with an executive of one, unidentified rival, stating, What cannot happen is that a government-controlled Citi does better than healthier institutions because it has access to cheap funding and it is effectively backstopped by the US.      Pundits in the meantime continue to argue the virtues and flaws of an out-right nationalization.  Economist  Paul Krugman  yesterday wrote in his New York Times column  that the government should temporarily nationalize banks and then flip them to private investors, as a way to both save the banks and to prevent taxpayers from getting the short-end of the bailout stick.  William Isaac , a former FDIC chairman and now head of D.C. consulting firm The Secura Group,  writes at WSJ.com  that nationalization would be wrong because it would create a domino effect of successive bank takeovers, and because there is no real exit strategy to return banks to private ownership once they have been nationalized.     Citi shares are up 22 cents, or 10.3%, at $2.36, having pulled back a bit from an earlier session high of $2.47. Other financials are jumping as well, with  Bank of America  ( BAC ) rising 67 cents, or 17%, to $4.58, after B of A CEO Ken Lewis  reportedly circulated a memo saying the company wont need government money . Goldman Sachs ( GS ) is up $10.43, or 13%, at $90.50;  Deutsche Bank  ( DB ) is up 19% at $23.57; and  Morgan Stanley  ( MS ) is up $2.93, or 16%, at $21.75.
