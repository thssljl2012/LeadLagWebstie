                                                       Citigroup                           Reconfigures Equity Component, But with Significant                         Dilution                                                     Earlier today  Citigroup                          ( C )                         announced it will offer to convert into common shares                         approximately  $27.5 billion of its                           preferred stock                           sold to public and private investors, and up to $25.0 billion in                         preferred stock bought by the U.S. government. The U.S. government                         would have approximately a 36% stake in Citigroup, while existing                         shareholders would be cut to a 26% stake, if fully executed.                                                     The bank is suspending its payment of                         dividends on preferred stock.  And though the common                         shareholders have to approve the deal, they do not have much                         choice, as Citigroup will issue securities to preferred                         shareholders who agree to the swap that let them buy common stock                         for a penny a share if shareholders don't approve the deal.                                                     The Treasury would only participate                         in the conversion once other preferred shareholders (predominately                         sovereign wealth funds) participated.  So far, the Government                         of Singapore Investment Corp. and Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal                         have agreed to participate in the exchange.                                                    While the conversion would not involve any additional government                         investment, under this maximum conversion scenario the primary                         result would be a significant increase in its tangible common                         equity and boost its tangible common equity ratio.                                                    However,  Citigroup will still have to                         endure a "stress test"  (which examines a bank's ability to                         withstand various economic scenarios).  Once the test will have been completed, Citicorp                         would still be required to raise additional capital, which could                         create to potential for additional dilution.                                                     This move makes the U.S. government the largest shareholder of the                         bank, and will probably play a much more active role in shaping the                         banks direction. It is a form of nationalization, whatever it may                         be termed by the Government.  As a                         result of the deal, the stakes of existing common shareholders have                         been severely diluted.  We expect the shares will remain                         under pressure.                                                    We suspect Government will end up acquiring a substantial stake in                         the many other banks which will be required to rebuild their                         capital after the stress tests, as private capital will not be easy                         to come by. As such, we advise investors totally avoid those banks                         which are perfect candidates for capital infusion by the Government                         after the stress tests, like  Bank                         of America  ( BAC ),  U.S.                         Bancorp  ( USB ),  PNC Financial                         Services Group  ( PNC ) and                          Wells Fargo  ( WFC ).
