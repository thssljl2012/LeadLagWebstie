 From Money &amp; Markets:   AIG shares are now 30c, if we can't get insurance ship's don't sail , planes don't fly....and on it goes..      GM IS ON ITS DEATH BED: Two years ago, I warned you that General Motors was headed for bankruptcy. This morning GMs own auditors revealed an unnamed material weakness in the companys accounting  and warned that theres serious doubt the automaker will survive.         BANK OF AMERICA, CITIGROUP AND AIG ARE ON LIFE SUPPORT: As soon as dire realities force Washington to pull the plug, these giant institutions will be in bankruptcy.          GENERAL ELECTRIC IS IN INTENSIVE CARE: S&amp;P has already issued a negative outlook on GEs debt and, this week, Moodys is considering slashing the companys credit rating  a strong signal that the company may soon be fighting for its life.          JPMORGAN CHASE NEXT? This morning, Moodys slashed its outlook to negative. Ditto for Wells Fargo.    To me, JPMorgan Chase is the most worrisome of all. After all  it is Americas largest bank with a market value thats greater than Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup combined!      Remember: JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. holds $91.3 trillion in derivatives  a notional value thats 40.6 times its total assets  including $9.2 trillion credit default swaps, hands-down the riskiest form of derivatives.      Worse, the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency warns that JPMorgan Chase Bank is also exposed to extremely large credit risk with its derivatives trading partners: For each dollar of capital, the bank has credit exposure of $4.00  nearly twice the average exposure of Bank of America and Citibank.
