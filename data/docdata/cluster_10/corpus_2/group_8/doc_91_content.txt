Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York called a meeting on the future of Lehman, which included the possibility of an emergency liquidation of its assets.  Lehman reported that it had been in talks with Bank of America and Barclays for the company's possible sale. However, both Barclays and Bank of America ultimately declined to purchase the entire company.    The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) offered an exceptional trading session on Sunday, September 14, 2008, to allow market participants to offset positions in various derivatives on the condition of a Lehman bankruptcy later that day.   Although the bankruptcy filing missed the deadline, many dealers honored the trades they made in the special session.     Lehman Brothers headquarters in New York City on September 15, 2008In New York, shortly before 1 a.m. the next morning, Lehman Brothers Holdings announced it would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection  citing bank debt of $613 billion, $155 billion in bond debt, and assets worth $639 billion.  It further announced that its subsidiaries will continue to operate as normal.  A group of Wall Street firms agreed to provide capital and financial assistance for the bank's orderly liquidation and the Federal Reserve, in turn, agreed to a swap of lower-quality assets in exchange for loans and other assistance from the government. "   In other words, they tried to coerce some institutions into saving the institution and to their credit they were smart enough to decline.  ON EDIT:  Also, there is the moral hazard conundrum:  "If we save Lehman, will other endangered institutions behave irresponsibly in order to get government assistance."
