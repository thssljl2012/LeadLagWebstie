Note that the test on Citigroup was done on its December 31st numbers - when the latest move by Treasury and Singapore to convert their preferreds into common equity have not been taken into account.  Assuming Morningstar's stress test is sufficient, then Citigroup will not need to raise any more capital.        The only large bank on this list that needs to convert is Bank of America.  And if the Treasury does it right this time, the conversion price should be at most a 10% haircut to its February 9th closing price $6.87 a share.  Also note that Bank of America is still holding a significant chunk of restricted stock on China Construction Bank - which is not officially taken into account in tangible equity on its balance sheet.  Combined with a significant portion of super senior MBS that they've written down but is expected to be paid back over time, Bank of America is probably understating its common equity by around $8 to $9 billion.
