The next Governor of New York will not let Republican execs get away with rape...  Some of the top earners at Merrill Lynch who were given $209 million in 2008 were subpoenaed by New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, a source close to the investigation tells the Huffington Post.  The subpoenas were served on the seven executives - including Andrea Orcel, the firm's top investment banker (who was paid $33.8 million in cash and stock in 2008), trading chief Thomas Montag and former head of strategy Peter Kraus, who were named in the Wall Street Journal today, according to the source.  The subpoenas compel the executives, some of whom currently work at Bank of America, to come in and discuss their bonuses, who they communicated with regarding their bonuses, when they got their bonuses and other relevant information, says the source.  ************************************  Nothing seems shocking these days when it comes to bailed out banks. We learned after the Super Bowl that Bank of America had spent millions on a carnival and other perks during the event, that former Merrill CEO John Thain had doled out over a million dollars to redecorate his office and that AIG was sending its executives to a spa.
