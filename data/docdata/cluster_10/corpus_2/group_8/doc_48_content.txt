      Why Ken Lewis Destroyed Bank Of America   http://www.forbes.com/2009/03/03/ken-lewis...nance_bofa.html   Snippet  Lewis had been the right-hand man to McColl, who really built Bank of America into the banking powerhouse it became. As at General Motors (nyse: GM - news - people ) in the 1980s, the executives not only worked together, they practically lived together, residing in the same neighborhoods in Charlotte and belonging to the same country clubs. Even after McColl retired in 2001, he continued to be seen everywhere. He kept the offices of his investment firm on the 54th floor of Bank of America's headquarters.
