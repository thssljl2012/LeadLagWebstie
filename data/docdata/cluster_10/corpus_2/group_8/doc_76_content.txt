          About the problem: "Investors fear large losses lurk on GE Capital's $637 billion balance sheet, particularly on assets such as commercial real estate and loans in Eastern Europe."   Who knows what is real or rational these days -- is GE counterparty to any deriviatives or have they issued any themselves?  If so, is there anyne who can say what these will be worth in a month or in a year?  Two-year GE bonds (GE Capital) are paying 8.43% yield to maturity.  By contrast Bank of America two-year notes are paying 1.307%.  Somebody/the market thinks there is considerable risk involved in loaning money to GE capital.  David
