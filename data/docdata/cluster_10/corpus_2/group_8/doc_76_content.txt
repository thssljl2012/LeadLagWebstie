Sorry, I was just executing a trade request for about five thousand shares of Citicorp (C), at $0.97 per share, hence my lack of answering.         I don't see the government nationalizing Citi or any other major bank. If they wanted to do that, they'd have done it already, either by conservatorship, receivership, or full on nationalization of them. Unlike WaMu and Wachovia, which one was seized and the other was forced into a buyout or it would have been seized, Citi is an major international financial company, and many government do not allow a foreign government to own a certain percentage of a bank. Mexico, for example, has such a rule. Since Citi owns Banamex, the second largest bank in Mexico, it'd be regulatory-wise impossible for the government to take control.     Another reason I'm taking this view is that if the government WAS to nationalize Citi, they'd lose ALL the money they've put into their stock as part of the TARP/bailout plans, and it's very doubtful they'd want to do that.    The next reason why is that, unlike WaMu and Wachovia, a Citi nationalization would instill massive fear, with major selloffs and then short sellers capitalization on the panic, and driving stocks of JPMorgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, US Bancorp, etc, down even further in the ensuing selloff/panic.     Just my two cents, as a Citicorp shareholder/financial major. I called WaMu's takeover/failure, Wachovia's takeover, National City's takeover, and Sovereign's takeover, so hopefully this one will be in-line with this.         And just for note: I am not a financial advisor of any institution, nor do I endorse or guarantee the stock performance of any company. I am not responsible for anyone's possible incurred losses.
