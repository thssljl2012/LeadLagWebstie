Classic Bankster Moves Thain Straps on 2nd Golden Chute This Year September 15, 2008, 12:44 am From Eric Dash, a DealBook colleague: John A. Thain, Merrill Lynchs chairman and chief executive, has probably just earned himself a membership into an ever-expanding club: Wall Street leaders who have been swept out of the executive suite by the credit crisis. With the sudden $50 billion sale of Merrill to Bank of America Sunday evening, Mr. Thain will likely wind up without a job. No announcement on the deal has been made, but Mr. Thain is unlikely to report to Kenneth D. Lewis, Bank of Americas longtime chairman and chief executive. The deal would trigger a change-of-control clause in Mr. Thains employment contract, allowing him to walk away with about $25 million from his time at Merrill, according to a pay analysis by James F. Reda &amp; Associates. Not bad for less than 10 months on the job. Mr. Thain pocketed a $15 million sign-on bonus and about a $58,000 salary in 2007. He has taken home another $530,000 in salary for the first nine months of 2008. Although he will not receive any cash severance, Mr. Thain will be eligible to cash in shy of $10 million worth of restricted stock valued at the $29-a-share purchase price. The bulk of his options are worthless at the deals price. It would also be the second time Mr. Thain made out with a big haul in the past year. When he left the New York Stock Exchange last November, he took $820,000 of deferred compensation, $3.6 million in restricted stock and options on top of the $14.9 million he made at the exchange, according to James F. Reda &amp; Associates. Of course, he is not the only Merrill leader to leave with parting gifts in the past year. His predecessor, E. Stanley ONeal, received an exit package worth more than $161 million when he was forced out in October, on top of the $70 million he made during his four years at the helm. The bulk of Mr. ONeals exit pay was linked to previously earned benefits and stock. http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/thain-straps-on-2nd-golden-chute-this-year/
