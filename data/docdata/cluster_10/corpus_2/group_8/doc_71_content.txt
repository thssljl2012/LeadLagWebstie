  JPMorgan Chase is the most worrisome of all. After all  it is Americas largest bank with a market value thats greater than Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup  combined !  Remember: JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. holds $91.3 trillion in derivatives  a notional value thats 40.6 times its total assets   including  $9.2 trillion credit default swaps, hands-down the riskiest form of derivatives.    Worse, the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency warns that JPMorgan Chase Bank is  also  exposed to extremely large credit risk with its derivatives trading partners: For each dollar of capital, the bank has credit exposure of $4.00  nearly twice the average exposure of Bank of America and Citibank.    BOTTOM LINE: Americas four largest banks  JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Bank of America and Wells Fargo  are ALL major threats to our nations future and to your money!
