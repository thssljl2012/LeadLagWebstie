Broker snap: Barclays facing triple threat    Date: Friday 20 Mar 2009  LONDON (ShareCast) - The share price of Barclays is up by 45% this week but Morgan Stanley believes the shares are getting ahead of themselves, with buyers ignoring the prospect of the bank needing to raise money again this year.     Morgan Stanley (MS) has cut its price target from 145p to 90p for Barclays, saying it faces a triple threat of credit write-downs, a decline in banking revenues and an increase in bad debts.     MS has speculated that the bank will lose an additional &pound;7bn on its structured credit portfolios, and will need to raise money this year to shore up its balance sheet.     &#147;A sale of iShares would provide it with headroom to avoid the asset protection scheme and the reset of the mandatory convertible note (end June deadline). However, we worry that this would not be enough and pencil in a further &pound;4bn capital increase in this cycle," MS said.     The US bank maintains its &#147;equal weight&#148; rating on the shares.
