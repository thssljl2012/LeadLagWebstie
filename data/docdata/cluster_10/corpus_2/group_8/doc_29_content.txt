Correct. Again, like I said, it's not 100% sure, but due to the size and scope of Citicorp, being that it operates on an international scale like no other US banking company does, I don't see a takeover by the government. It'd be far too complicated to try and handle, given the fact Citibank (the banking subsidiary) operates in over 100 countries.    And as for double digits... it depends on when Citigroup officially splits into Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp being the "good" assets (Citibank, CitiCards, commercial banking, etc) and Citi Holdings being the "bad" assets (CitiFinancial, Primerica, etc). Once it officially happens and profit returns, we could see double digit numbers.    I'm just not sure when that will be complete.
