         BAC continues to nose dive.  Today it closed at $3.17.  Just Monday it was around $4.50...    Investors continue to bail out as the government mulls over just how it can save Bank of America.    If the stock becomes a penny stock, I'm actually tempted to buy.  But - the stock CAN go to zero...  I guess that's the real risk at this point.
