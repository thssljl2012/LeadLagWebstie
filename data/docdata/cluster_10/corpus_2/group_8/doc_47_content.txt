BofA chief calls Merrill aid mistake   Bank of Americas request for $20bn of government money to prop up its acquisition of Merrill Lynch was a tactical mistake that made the bank appear as weak as Citigroup, Ken Lewis, BofAs chief executive told the Financial Times on Monday.      But Mr Lewis said he would stay on as CEO of the North Carolina-based bank until it paid back the $45bn of government money it received under the US Treasurys bank recapitalisation programme, possibly within two to three years.         So, begs the questions, how will Pfizer get past the 1-year bridge loan lending facility, if banks are getting out of the government borrowing/nationalization process?????????
