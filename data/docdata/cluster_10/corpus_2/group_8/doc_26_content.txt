   SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday placed Bank of America Corp.'s (BAC:bank of america corporation com  BAC 3.59, -0.05, -1.4%) long-term ratings, including its senior debt rating of A1, under review for possible downgrade. Moody's review of Bank of America's long-term debt ratings will focus on the impact that future credit costs could have on Bank of America's capital ratios and the rating implications of possible systemic support. "The review was prompted by a concern that Bank of America's capital ratios could deteriorate in 2009 from their current levels, which are comparatively low, because of the potential need to take high loan loss provisions and absorb additional charges in its capital markets exposures," Moody's said in a statement.  &raquo; www.marketwatch.com/news/story/M&middot;&middot;&middot;hplatest   umm don't you think this should happened awhile back and not right now.
