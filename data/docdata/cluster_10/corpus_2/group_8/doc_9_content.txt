She estimated New York-based JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and  American Express  would decrease lines by $300 billion and $100 billion, respectively.    Outaheresoon, many people don't know how important this is. They don't know that:    Independent businesses with fewer than 500 employees created 60 to 80 percent of new jobs annually in the U.S. during the last decade, according to the Washington-based  Small Business Administrations  Web site.      The company I work for is also having problems. We don't use credit but our customers do. Our customers want us to "front" them expensive equipment until they get paid when the job is completed (6 months- &gt;1yr). We are not equipedto take on that sort of risk since we have no way of knowing if the customer will survive .
