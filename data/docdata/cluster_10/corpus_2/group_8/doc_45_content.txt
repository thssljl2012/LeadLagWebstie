     Former Merrill Chief Thain out at Bank of America     Thain Resigns From Bank of America After Word He Rushed Out Bonuses as Merrill Lost Money        By STEPHEN BERNARD and IEVA M. AUGSTUMS AP Business Writers   NEW YORK January 22, 2009 (AP)      The Associated Press           Former Merrill Lynch Chairman and CEO John Thain, left, is reported to have left Bank of America.   (AP Photo)     John Thain resigned under pressure from Bank of America on Thursday after reports he rushed out billions of dollars in bonuses to Merrill Lynch employees in his final days as CEO there, while the brokerage was suffering huge losses and just before Bank of America took it over.    The bonuses were paid before Bank of America's acquisition of Merrill became final on Jan. 1, and while Bank of America was privately telling the government that Merrill was losing so much money that the deal might fall through unless it could get more federal bailout money.    Bank of America later received an additional $20 billion from the government, in part to offset the unexpected Merrill losses. The brokerage lost $15 billion in the fourth quarter and more than $27 billion for the year.    The bonuses, typically paid in January, were instead given in December and totaled $3 billion to $4 billion, the Financial Times reported Thursday. Bank of America would not confirm the size of the bonuses.
