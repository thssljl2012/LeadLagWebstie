         Recs: 0              Abu Dhabi reviewing Citigroup investment: sources              - Reuters             By Stanley Carvalho    ABU  DHABI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi is assessing its $7.5 billion investment in  Citigroup as the bank's problems deepen and consequences of a possible  nationalization become clearer, according to sources close to the Abu  Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA).    ADIA invested $7.5 billon last  year in Citi through convertible bonds that pay 11 percent in interest,  but it must start converting the bonds into 235.6 million shares in  Citigroup from March next year.    "Nothing has changed from ADIA's  perspective at this point. ADIA's convertible bonds are due for  conversion in a phased manner between March 2010 and September 2011,  and that stands," an Abu Dhabi government official told Reuters.    "But  it is carefully assessing its options due to the latest events --  although no decision is taken yet," he said, declining to be named.    A spokesman for ADIA, thought to be the world's largest sovereign fund, declined to comment.    Abu Dhabi is the wealthiest of seven emirates within the United Arab Emirates, the world's fifth-largest petroleum exporter.    ADIA's  returns as a bondholder have been unaffected by continuing troubles at  Citigroup, but the dramatic fall in Citi's share price has eroded the  conversion value of the mandatory convertible bonds.    In the  original deal with ADIA, the Citi securities must be converted into  common stock at a price between $31.83 and $37.24 a share between March  2010 and September 2011. Citi last traded at $1.50 a share.    Options  for the investment include holding them through to the conversion,  which may allow enough time for the share price to recover, or  converting them early, in a move that may head off the possibility of  the U.S. government nationalizing it.    "We know ADIA is following  the recent developments closely, but as a bondholder, ADIA's  investments are secure because the U.S. government has left bond  holders untouched, unlike other investors such as preferred  shareholders," a senior Abu Dhabi-based banker close to ADIA said.    "However,  it is early days, and we need to wait and see what ramifications the  latest events would have and whether there would be pressure on  investors in bonds to convert (early)," he said.    Citi, he said,  has been urging preferred shareholders and convertible bond holders to  convert to common stock to help avoid nationalization by the U.S.  government.    FORCED CONVERSION?    On Friday, the U.S.  government announced it would convert up to $25 billion of its $45  billion worth of preferred stock into common equity at $3.25 per share.    Other  preferred shareholders, including the Government of Singapore  Investment Corporation and Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed, will convert  up to $27.5 billion of their holdings at the same price.    "Compared  to Alwaleed or Singapore, ADIA has no aspirations in any controlling  stake or a board seat and is just happy to ride along as an investor  with regular returns. At least for the moment, ADIA's investment is  safe," an Abu Dhabi-based financial analyst said.    "ADIA is a  long-haul investor and is in a different boat compared to other  investors in Citi," he said, declining to be named due to company  policy.    Gulf sovereign funds have been badly burned buying into  troubled U.S. banks, with the Kuwait Investment Authority investing  last year in U.S. banks Citigroup and Merrill Lynch before both stocks  dived and the latter was sold for a fraction of its earlier price to  Bank of America.    Major sovereign wealth funds are now holding off  big investments abroad, with some focusing on investing at home to  stimulate economies in the wake of the global crisis, a recent survey  showed.
