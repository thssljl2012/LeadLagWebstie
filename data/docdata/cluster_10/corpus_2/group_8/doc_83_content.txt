       Bank of America chief calls Merrill aid tactical mistake -     FT reports the co's request for $20 bln of government money to prop up its acquisition of Merrill Lynch was a "tactical mistake" that made the bank appear as weak as Citigroup, Ken Lewis, BofA's chief executive told the FT. But Mr Lewis said he would stay on as CEO of the bank until it paid back the $45 bln of govt money it received under the US Treasury's bank recapitalization programme, possibly within two to three years. This is the first time he has signalled his plans to leave the co. However, he expressed regret that an "abundance of caution" had led him to take more aid than he said was necessary to absorb Merrill's $15 bln fourth-quarter loss. "In hindsight, it was a tactical mistake because it put us in the same category as Citigroup," said Mr Lewis. "We could still have had 8% tier 1 capital after a $15 bln loss but we wanted a cushion." Mr Lewis said that it would have been better to request only $10 bln for that purpose. He said that could have helped to curtail investor fears that further problems were in the offing... "I want to repay the Tarp money before I go anywhere, and by then I think we will be seeing the success of the Merrill Lynch acquisition," he said. "It would be very easy to disappear into the sunset but we have to slug through this."   Another barn door situation  I'm sure the MER shareholders are happy with this revelation lol
