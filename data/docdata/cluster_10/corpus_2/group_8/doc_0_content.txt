 IRIS Message Board Posts          Recs: 0              Underlying Bank Collateral   38+% mortgage based securities MBS and 24+ commercial CMBS most levered at from 20-35% against synthetic derivatives created against the real underlying collateral. Is there any wonder how we got where we are including MTM ABX and NSS.? Gangbanksters sold us down the river. If the people only knew , and most never will. We can not let AIG go because the insurance holders would collapse with all the rest. Bad heavy rain at the top of the river is a deluge at the bottom.
