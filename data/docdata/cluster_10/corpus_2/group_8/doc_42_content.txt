Here's a list of the top 20 global banks based upon their 2007 revenue, from Fortune magazine's Global 500 issue of July 2008 issue (lots of changes have happened since then, but this is still a more representative list of the top banks, I believe).       1    ING Group       2    Fortis        3    Citigroup        4    Dexia Group        5    HSBC Holdings        6    BNP Paribas        7    Crdit Agricole        8    Deutsche Bank        9    Bank of America Corp.        10    UBS        11    J.P.
