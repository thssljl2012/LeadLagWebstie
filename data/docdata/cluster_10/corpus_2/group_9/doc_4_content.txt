Bank of America May Increase Salaries for Investment Bankers March 28 (Bloomberg) -- Bank of America Corp. plans to increase some investment bankers salaries by as much as 70 percent following the takeover earlier this year of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., people familiar with the proposal said. The concepts we are considering would not increase total compensation, Brian Moynihan, Bank of Americas president of investment banking and wealth management, wrote yesterday in a memo to employees obtained by Bloomberg News. Rather, we believe it is responsible, and consistent with the emerging public consensus, that a greater percentage of overall compensation come from fixed base salary. Bank of America, which has received $45 billion of taxpayers money, may raise the annual base pay for some managing directors to about $300,000 from $180,000, said the people, who declined to be identified because the final numbers are still under discussion. Salaries for less-senior directors would climb to about $250,000 from $150,000, and vice presidents would get $200,000, up from about $125,000, the people said.
