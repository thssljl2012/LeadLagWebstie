Dealers Agree To Disclose More CDS Trades: NY Fed SAN FRANCISCO -- Major dealers and investors in over-the-counter derivatives agreed to report all credit-default swap trades not cleared through a central counterparty to a central trade repository, the New York Federal Reserve said late Wednesday. The New York Fed, which hosted the meeting, said industry participants including Bank of America Corp. , Citigroup,Inc. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase also agreed to broaden the use of central counterparties for credit-default swaps. OTC credit default swaps allow traders to hedge and speculate on the creditworthiness of companies. A surge in trading volumes, followed by the collapse of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and bailout of AIG, has pressured the industry to establish a central clearinghouse for trades rather than settle these contracts through counterparties. http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/finance/dealers-agree-disclose-cds-trades-ny-fed/
