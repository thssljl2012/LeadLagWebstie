 To me it would appear difficult for the banks to extract themselves from the chipper.  I came across this little gem late last week....    Today, five US banks, according to data in the just-released Federal  Office of Comptroller of the Currency's Quarterly Report on Bank  Trading and Derivatives Activity, hold 96% of all US bank derivatives  positions in terms of nominal values, and an eye-popping 81% of the  total net credit risk exposure in event of default.     The top three are, in declining order of importance:    J     PMorgan Chase,  which holds a staggering $88 trillion in derivatives; Bank of America  with $38 trillion, and Citibank with $32 trillion  . Number four in the  derivatives sweepstakes is Goldman Sachs, with a mere $30 trillion in  derivatives; number five, the merged Wells Fargo-Wachovia Bank, drops  dramatically in size to $5 trillion. Number six, Britain's HSBC Bank  USA, has $3.7 trillion.      http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/node/41373      msg 113289
