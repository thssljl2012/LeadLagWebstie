 April 23 (Bloomberg) -- Fifth Third Bancorp and Regions Financial Corp. may be among regional lenders that struggle to pass the U.S. governments stress test because they are mired in commercial real estate debt, analysts say.        Commercial loans in default or foreclosure rose 43 percent in the first quarter to $65.9 billion from $46 billion at year- end, according to New York-based research firm Real Capital Analytics Inc. Property values have fallen at least 30 percent since their 2007 peak. Fifth Third and Regions hold too many commercial mortgage and construction loans on their books, said Jeff Davis, research director for Howe Barnes Hoefer &amp; Arnett.        The loss rates on commercial are going to be horrific and the big guys avoided a lot of this because they were securitizing it, said Christopher Whalen, co-founder of Institutional Risk Analytics in Torrance, California. Were talking about malls and developments in the local markets where the regional banks are the primary delivery form of finance for commercial real estate development.        Regions and Fifth Third are among 19 U.S. lenders bracing for preliminary results due tomorrow from a government stress test of whether they have enough capital. The industry as a whole needs $1 trillion, Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods said in a research note today, citing its own stress test.        Analysts speculate that the nations biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co., will do better on the test because they have cut risk by selling off loans and piling up reserves. Wells Fargo said yesterday it has put aside $23 billion, enough to cover two years of losses on commercial loans and mortgages.        Hard and Fast Decline        Meredith Whitney, the former Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analyst who correctly predicted a slide in shares of U.S. banks, said regional lenders may struggle to pass the stress tests.        Commercial real estate will decline hard and fast, Whitney said this week in an interview on Bloomberg Television. For a lot of the regional banks that have so much commercial real estate exposure as a percentage of their core capital levels, its going to be more difficult.        Regional banks operate in multiple states and rank among the top 50 in the U.S. by assets, excluding the four money- center banks: Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup Inc. Cincinnatis Fifth Third and Regions, based in Birmingham, have too many homebuilder loans and do business in states with high jobless rates such as Michigan and Florida, said Davis, whose firm is based in Chicago.        SunTrust Debt        Regions, BB&amp;T Corp. of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and Atlantas SunTrust Banks Inc. each hold commercial real estate loans that make up more than 10 percent of their loan portfolios, according to Friedman, Billings, Ramsey Group Inc.        SunTrust, which posted an $815.2 million first-quarter loss today, said debt it doesnt expect to be repaid more than doubled to $610.1 million, driven by commercial, residential mortgage, home equity, and real estate construction loans.        The bank has reduced the size of its construction lending by 34 percent since the end of 2007 to $9.05 billion, including an $800 million decline in the first quarter. The bank said it wasnt collecting interest on $1.49 billion in construction loans as of March 31, or 16 percent.        SunTrust remains financially strong, Chief Executive Officer James Wells said on a conference call. We have the resources to manage successfully through this cycle.        Fifth Third        Ohios Fifth Third said today that $50 billion of its $83.6 billion loan portfolio are made up of commercial loans and leases. Commercial loans, mortgage and construction loans and leases made accounted for $256 million in uncollectible debt for the quarter, more than half the total $490 million in charge- offs for the period.        We expect core earnings to strengthen and credit costs to decline significantly, Chief Executive Officer Kevin Kabat said on a conference call today.        At Regions, commercial real estate loans make up 15 percent of its total lending portfolio, FBR analysts said in an April 22 research note. Non-performing loans totaled 2.4 percent. The non-performers suggest that future credit losses will be elevated, FBR analyst Scott Valentin said in an April 22 note.        Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins declined to comment on the stress tests. Tim Deighton, a spokesman for Regions, said the bank cant discuss the test under direction of regulators.        Regions        Regions yesterday reported first-quarter net income of $77 million after setting aside less money for future loan losses than analysts had expected. The bank has cut its risk by selling off loans linked to real state and isnt seeing an increase in defaults on other business loans, William Wells, the banks chief risk officer, said on a conference call yesterday.        Credit quality is still very difficult, but the signs are there that the banking industry is going to work its way through this, Dowd Ritter, chief executive officer, said yesterday.        The stress tests themselves face scrutiny by skeptics such as Robert Clarke, a senior partner at Bracewell &amp; Guiliani and former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency.        While criteria for the tests havent been formally released, theyre likely to be linked to projections about other data including where housing prices and jobless rates will go.        They should never have done it, because everybody is going to be second-guessing the assumptions, Clarke said. Everybody you talk to is going to have a different opinion on what the unemployment rate is ultimately going to be or what the gross domestic product numbers are ultimately going to be in 2009.        The Obama administration may direct banks that are judged short of capital by the test to disclose how theyre going to get additional funds, according to a person familiar with the matter. Analysts have speculated that the tests may trigger new drops in bank stocks or runs by depositors.        It creates more headline risk for the administration, Whalen said. They misunderstand the perception of the stress tests and how deep this penetrates into American society and consciousness.
