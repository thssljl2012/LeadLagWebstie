 Houston,  To me this revelation is enormous. It seems likely to me that many share holders will sue Bank of America for accepting the deal and not disclosing material information and falsely promoting the deal while not disclosing the truth to the public.   It seems likely to me that there will be a call for the Treasury and Federal Reserve to be investigated for Forcing a merger without Congressional approval or any public disclosure whatsoever.  We keep hearing how the bottom is in for the banks and that things are turning around and then shortly thereafter (every time) the bottom falls out again with another revelation. Full Disclosure is needed and now.  I would not be entirely surprised to see a run on the bank. The enormity of the corruption seems nearly implausible to me.
