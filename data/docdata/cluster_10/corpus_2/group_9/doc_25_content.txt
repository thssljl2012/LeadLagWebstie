 New York Times salaries hold steady in downturn    Wed Mar 11, 2009By Robert MacMillanNEW YORK (Reuters) -  New York Times Co executives will get the same salaries they have been paid since 2006, even as U.S. newspaper advertising revenue declines worsen and the publisher tries to pay off millions in debt .     Chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr , whose family controls the Times through a special class of shares,  will earn about $1.09 million this year , according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. Chief Executive Janet Robinson will earn $1 million.    Executives at the Times, which owns the namesake newspaper, as well as other U.S. papers including The Boston Globe, have been making the same base salary since 2006, while ad revenue has declined and the company comes under more pressure to find a way to reverse its flagging fortunes.    More companies this year are freezing or cutting executive pay because they consider it fiscally prudent. It also shows employees and investors that executives are suffering along with them.  Some financial institutions such as Merrill Lynch - now part of Bank of America Corp - have been burned for awarding lavish compensation to executives, even as share values plunged and thousands of workers lost their jobs     Sulzberger's total compensation, including stock and option awards, as well as deferred compensation, fell to $2.4 million in 2008 from $3.4 million in 2007.  CEO Robinson's total compensation rose to $5.8 million from $4.1 million .      Sulzberger  also received a one-time discretionary bonus of $38,045, which the Times said recognized "the impact of a multi-year salary freeze." Robinson received $35,000, according to the filing . Other executives received smaller amounts     The Times also said it plans to sell its company jet, a Falcon 50EX, which is made by Dassault Aviation SA . On Dassault's website, the 50EX's solicit best offers. One, built in 1998, carries an asking price of nearly $13 million    Of course this is no surprise. The New York Times is famous for its hypocrisy.    By the way, notice how The Times couldn't even bring itself to buy an American-made corporate jet. (Dassault is French.)     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~       Hey what happened to Obama on this one?      Why isn't he 'sicking' his ACORN buddies after New York Times ...     The Times is doing the same thing. When they are going down the toilet their execs are getting millions
