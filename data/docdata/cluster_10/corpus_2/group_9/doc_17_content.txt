  Bank of America -&amp; the rest that I posted.  I don't trust the financials.    (accounting tricks designed to boost stock values &amp; false perception of financial health)       Pandit @ Citi &amp; Lewis @ BAC  both have a lot to GAIN -    (if they pull off this deception of profits - via stock gains)       Duffminster  -  I agree with you  - that they are also trying to avoid a "Run on the bank"   This false perception may also be perpetrated by Geithner &amp; the FED.      WHY? - the FDIC has at last count had to "rescue" around 20 - 25 banks already this year.   How many more can they afford to rescue?      ESPECIALLY - If I remember correctly - someone in the FDIC stated not too long ago:   "We are close to insolvency ourselves" (the FDIC)
