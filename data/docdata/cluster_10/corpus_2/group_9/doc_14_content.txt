This was the original wsj bulletin at 7:23 AM yesterday.  I think they did better than many that followed.  It was why I said that it was all about one time stuff.                                       Bank of America's first-quarter net income soared to $4.2  billion, helped by contributions from Merrill Lynch, which BofA purchased in  January. The results include a $1.9 billion pretax gain on the sale of China  Construction Bank shares, and $2.2 billion in gains related to mark-to-market  adjustments on certain Merrill Lynch structured notes. The bank said credit  quality deteriorated further across all lines of business as housing prices  continued to fall and unemployment rose, leading to higher losses in almost all  consumer portfolios. CEO Ken Lewis cautioned that amid the "welcome"  profit news, the company continues to face "extremely difficult challenges  primarily from deteriorating credit quality driven by weakness in the economy  and growing unemployment."         msg 128089
