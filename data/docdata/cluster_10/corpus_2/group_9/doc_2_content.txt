                                                        Bank of America Pressured to Buy Merrill Lynch (Update1)       Cuomo Jr goes after a big gamefish        By Karen Freifeld and David Mildenberg              April 23 (Bloomberg) --  Bank of America Corp.  Chief Executive Officer  Kenneth D. Lewis  was pressured to complete the purchase of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. after he sought to cancel the deal because of staggering deterioration at the brokerage, according to New York State Attorney General  Andrew Cuomo .       Henry Paulson   ,  who was Treasury Secretary last December,   may have threatened to r  emo   ve   management  and directors of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank if they didnt comply, and Lewis was told not to disclose his opposition or the regulators action, Cuomo wrote in a letter to Congress released today.     Lewis and the board are under fire for not telling  shareholders  that New York-based Merrills fourth-quarter loss was spiraling toward $15.8 billion before they voted to approve the deal. Shareholders cast ballots next week on whether to re- elect directors including Lewis and splitting the chairman and CEO jobs. Some investors are calling for Lewis to resign.     Cuomos letter was based on recollections by Lewis of a Dec. 21 conversation. The letter, addressed to lawmakers including Senate Banking Committee Chairman  Christopher Dodd , said Paulson largely corroborated Lewiss account.     Lewis said he was instructed by federal officials not to disclose Merrills  losses , his desire to back out of the merger or about the intervention of regulators, Cuomos letter said. Regulators were concerned about systemic risk that might lead to the collapse of financial markets, the letter said.     Feds Advice     Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  didnt advise the bank or Lewis on disclosure issues or request that the bank not reveal information, a government official said today on condition of anonymity. On occasions when the issue of disclosure arose, the Fed chief said the banks management needed to make its own decision with its own counsel on Bank of Americas obligations, the person said.     We believe we acted legally and appropriately with regard to the Merrill Lynch transaction,  Scott Silvestri , a spokesman for Bank of America, said in a telephone interview.     The Treasury didnt make them decide to buy Merrill Lynch and Treasury didnt tell them how much to pay,  Jonathan Finger , whose family owns 1.5 million Bank of America shares, said in an interview today. They are the only financial institution that painted themselves into a corner where it had to sacrifice shareholders for the good of the country.     Finger and his father, Jerry, are leading a campaign opposing Lewiss re-election to the banks board of directors.
