In fact, their strategy was to buy up the people who collapsed before them so they could argue they were too big to fail and not go the way of Lehman Brothers.  They bought Countrywide knowing Countrywide's value was negative well before they ever tried to acquire Merrill Lynch.  Besides their stupid acquisitions, BAC had the same garbage on their balance sheet that all the other banks had.  Worthless assets.  Make no mistake about it, just about every giant financial institution was insolvent.  The only one that I'm not sure about was Wells Fargo because they went and outbid Citigroup to buy Wachovia without any government money.  The jury is still out on them.
