 The financial and economic crisis are largely based in the so called "Credit Crisis." Markets will tell us when that problem is actually getting better supposedly, that is if the PPT isn't screwing that barometer up as well.   I started this post back in October of 2008. Here is what we here from a leading bank CEO today. While we have a short bear rally, I don't think its going to hold based on the paradigm that the credit crisis is the barometer of the economic and financial condition at this time and I think the commercial real estate market is the next ice burg straight ahead. I disagree with Lewis about credit getting better later this year or in 2010. There is too much weight in commercial and residential real estate bearing down in increasing quanitities through out 2010 and 2011 in my opinion and more to come in commercial 2011 - 2014.   Bank of America's Lewis says credit is bad and getting worse  http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Bank-Americas-Lewis-says-credit/story.aspx?guid={3CE1C369-74FE-4631-B52E-679D4B473835}                   NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Bank of America Corp.      Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lewis warned that losses from souring loans will get worse rather than better and that his bank continues to put more money away to cover loan losses.                                        "Credit is bad and we believe credit is going to get worse before it will eventually stabilize and improve," Lewis said during a conference call with investors. "Whether that turn is later this year or in the first half of 2010, I'm not going to hazard a guess."
