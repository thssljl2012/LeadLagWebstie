          Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and then-Treasury Department chief Henry Paulson pressured Bank of America Corp. to not discuss its increasingly troubled plan to buy Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. -- a deal that later triggered a government bailout of BofA -- according to testimony by Kenneth Lewis, the bank's chief executive.  Mr. Lewis, testifying under oath before New York's attorney general in February, told prosecutors that he believed Messrs. Paulson and Bernanke were instructing him to keep silent about deepening financial difficulties at Merrill, the struggling brokerage giant. As part of his testimony, a transcript of which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Lewis said the government wanted him to keep quiet while the two sides negotiated government funding to help BofA absorb Merrill and its huge losses.    http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/   The dishonesty of Paulsen is certainly matched by Geithner .  When Paulsen and Bernanke stuck up Congress for  $700 billion ,Geithner ,who was then an arse-licking member of the Fed ,was also complicit .  Since then he has poured money into the banks ,has declared that they need another  $2 trillion , said they had all passed their self administered stress tests ,later admitted that the results were a mixed bag ,and now has declared that the vast majority are very well capitalised .  Amazingly , investors have begun to doubt him .
