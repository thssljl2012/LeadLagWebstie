NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- First Bank of Idaho became the fourth U.S. bank to fail Friday, raising the 2009 total to 29 -- four more than the 25 that failed all of last year, the government said.      The failure of the Ketchum, Idaho-based bank, along with banks based in Georgia, Michigan and California, will cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s deposit insurance fund $698.4 million.
