THERE IS A CREDIT CRISIS!!!! I am long close to 500k shares and am as frustrated as anyone--but we need to get a grip.The libor rate indicating interbank trading has improved dramatically over the last 6-8 weeks BUT despite huge capital infusions by our government[including partial socialization] our banks are still unstable. Citi is floundering and reducing size by 30 percent. Bank of America[our largest by assets] has required additional billions in cash PLUS 128 BILLION IN LOAN GUARANTEES TO COMPLETE THE MERRIL DEAL. Wells Fargo may still be in trouble. Obama is getting the other 350 billion of tarp---commercial real estate loans are in trouble. Credit is still a problem. I believe Larry has people looking to finance wwei---but IT COULD BE MONTHS BEFORE CAPITAL MARKETS ARE STABILIZED--WWEI IS NOT OPERATING IN A VACUUM--SELL IF YOU ARE IMPATIENT OR SUSPECT SCAM-I will hang until credit returns to a reasonable degree THEN judge wwei credibility
