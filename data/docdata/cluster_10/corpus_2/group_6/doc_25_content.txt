 RMBS Message Board Posts          Recs: 3              OT &gt;  "Let's start a new group: PETT - People for the Ethical Treatment of Taxpayers..."           - by Rich Galen, 'MULLINGS", Jan. 23, 2009        Here's why we hate these guys on Wall Street:        While the firm was collapsing around him, (according to the Wall Street Journal) "Thain had spent more than $1 million of the firm's money to decorate his office last year, including more than $35,000 for a toilet." [What can a $35,000 toilet do that a standard $129 toilet  can't  do?]   Thain's driver made $230,000 last year (US News &amp; World Report)   Merrill lost $41.2 Billion in 2008 ($15 billion in the fourth quarter), yet Merrill decided "to pay billions of dollars in bonuses days before the closing of its sale to B of A." (Financial Times)   "Bank of America last week struck a deal with the government to receive an additional $20 billion" to cover the losses at Merrill which had not been made known to B of A. (CNBC)   "Arguing that his quick sale of the firm to Bank of America helped avoid a larger catastrophe," Thain demanded payment of a $10 million bonus for 2008. (NY Times)   All of which cost you and me $143 billion in "an additional $20 billion in Treasury support; $118 billion of government backstops; a $15 billion loss at Merrill." (Wall Street Journal)            When was the last time you heard anyone mention "Sarbanes-Oxley." Remember that pesky law which required chief executives of publicly traded companies like Merrill-Lynch to  personally guarantee  the quality of their company's financial reports?          Let's start a new group: PETT, People for the Ethical Treatment of Taxpayers
