             Quote:            Investors in a Sarasota-based hedge fund could be out $350 million, and the man behind it has vanished.          Managers of the fund are telling clients that their money is gone, and they do not know if any will be recovered.         Fund principal Arthur G. Nadel, a prominent player in Sarasota social and philanthropic circles, disappeared this week.  His wife, Peg, filed a missing person report with law enforcement after finding a suicide note.         Investors  from individuals to the Sarasota YMCA Foundation  in the funds branded Viking, Valhalla and Scoop were stunned this week to learn they may be victims in what could become the largest investment swindle in Southwest Florida history.        Despite the carnage on Wall Street last year, investors had been told their investments earned more than 8 percent as of November.        Some are already calling it a mini-Madoff, after accused investment scammer Bernard Madoff of New York, who has been accused of creating an alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme that yielded similarly large percentage returns.         I feel abused. I feel beaten. I dont know who to believe, said Dr. Brad Lerner, who expects to lose nearly $730,000 in an IRA fund with Nadel and Moody.         Neil V. Moody, the president of Viking Management, declined to respond to interview requests.        In a statement issued Thursday to investors, Moody confirmed the funds appear depleted.        Unfortunately, just yesterday afternoon we became aware of an extremely serious situation suggesting that the funds may have virtually no remaining value, Moody wrote.        Moody, who lives part time in Evergreen, Colo., has told several investors interviewed by the Herald-Tribune the funds value totaled $350 million. He said he has contacted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and all appropriate authorities to report the situation.        Moody is telling clients that Nadel did all the fund trading, and that Moody had no idea anything was wrong until this week.        Nadel, 75, and Moody, 70, operated under the name Scoop Management Inc. in a double storefront at 1816 Main St., across from the Bank of America building.        Management appeared in a state of turmoil. Peg Nadel and son Geoff Quisenberry said they could not comment on the size of the companys assets under management, the number of clients, how much has been lost, or even whether it is accurate to call them a hedge fund operator.        The way I want to be represented is we are totally open and cooperative with all our clients and the authorities, and that includes the SEC, Peg Nadel said. We have nothing to hide. But until our counsel has a statement prepared for us to make public, we cannot comment on what is happening here.        She and Quisenberry both denied reports that employees were emptying out the office.          Link
