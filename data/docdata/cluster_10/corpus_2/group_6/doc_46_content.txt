 ARTNA Message Board Posts          Recs: 0              Merrill Lynch Clients Pulled $10 Billion in Fourth Quarter          &gt;&gt;&gt;My  first account was with Merrill. They charged incredibly high fees. I  have considered them the scum of the earth ever since they were  swapping Nigerian power barges with Fastow's (Skillings's?) off balance  sheet entities in order to cook Enron's earnings....all while selling  Enron stock to little old ladies. I really love to see Merrill going  down in flames. Schadenfraude at its best.&lt;&lt;&lt;      By Josh Fineman      Jan.  21 (Bloomberg) -- Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. clients withdrew $10 billion  in the fourth quarter, more than triple the pace of the previous three  months, as stock markets sank and Bank of America Corp. moved to  complete its acquisition of the New York- based firm.      The  outflows increased from $3 billion in the third quarter, according to a  Merrill filing yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission. Total clients assets, a figure that includes the declining  value of investments, fell to $1.25 trillion from $1.48 trillion as the  Dow Jones Industrial Average slid almost 20 percent.      The  withdrawals underline pressure faced by Bank of America Chief Executive  Officer Kenneth Lewis late last year as the severity of Merrills woes  mounted. Government officials on Jan. 15 granted Bank of America a $138  billion package that includes a $20 billion infusion as well as asset  guarantees.      A certain amount of drop is not surprising as the  appetite for risk declines, said Jaime Peters, an analyst at  Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. At the same time, It means Merrill Lynch  is having some problems, and that should raise a flag.      Lewis,  62, has come under criticism from investors and analysts for not  walking away from agreements to buy Merrill, the largest U.S.  brokerage, and Countrywide Financial Corp., the biggest home lender.  Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, last week reported  a $1.79 billion fourth-quarter loss, slashed its 32-cent quarterly  dividend to a penny and told investors results may worsen.      Thain, McCann, Fleming      Lewis  in September said Merrills main attractions were its 16,850 financial  advisers and the global strength of its investment bank. Former Merrill  CEO John Thain now heads the banks wealth management and corporate and  investment banking divisions, while senior Merrill executives Robert  McCann and Greg Fleming resigned less than a week after the transaction  was completed on Jan. 1.      Bank of Americas stock has plummeted  86 percent since the Merrill takeover was announced in mid-September,  on the same weekend that Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed. Its  down more than 64 percent in 2009.      The drop in client assets is  in part the result of advisers leaving and taking their customers with  them, said Adam Honore, an analyst at Aite Group LLC, a Boston-based  consulting firm.      Its fairly substantial, he said. Clients  were concerned with the stability of the firm and falling under the  Bank of America umbrella, he said.
