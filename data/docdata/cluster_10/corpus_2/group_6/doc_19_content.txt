       It's tough to figure out a very good gameplan from the current level.  It will be interesting to see how the market reacts to the JPM report tomorrow.  That will be the first glimpse of the earnings from the banks, and it's a good thing they are getting it out quickly.  That should give us a better idea whether the trading range for the market is still intact between 8000 and 9000.    Citibank looks like an absolute piece of junk down here at $4.57.  I don't know how they will be able to do a whole lot more damage to Citibank.  If they start to really push on JPM and BAC, things are going to get real dicey again.  Ideally, JPM can finish out the week without much further downside below the $25 strike level.  If JPM can provide any kind of support for a second half recovery, I think the market will be alright.  Still, the first quarter is always nasty.
