There is no such thing as forced competition.   The size of many of these institutions - their diversity and lower operating costs - it what has allowed them to survive. In the last serious recession in the early 1990s, 15,000 banks failed. This time, the number probably won't break 100.   Were it not for the elimination of Glass-Steagal, the current situation would be much worse. Banks that could not survive before are able to survive now because their assets are more diverse. IE - Morgan would have FAILED if Glass-Steagal had still been around because BoA would not have been able to buy them.   By merging, the banks are able to cut internal costs by reducing redundancies and provide more services.
