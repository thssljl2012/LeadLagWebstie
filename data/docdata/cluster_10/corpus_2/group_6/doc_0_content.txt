                        Last Week on Wall Street:       The week of 01/12/2008 - 01/16/2009       The second full week of trading in 2009 really wasnt that much better than the first. As measured by the Dow, the first full week saw a slide of 436 points and last week sported a 318 point slide.      A very weak opening Monday, and continued selling pressures throughout all of last weeks first session was widely viewed as just a continuation of the prior Fridays sell offs all around the world.  And since there was no real economic news out that day, Sparky concurs.      Last Tuesday was by far the weeks quietest day; and as one would expect it was the session with the lowest point spread between the intraday high and low. And here again, there was no economic news or real importance released that day.      But by pre-open Wednesday, the Street was abuzz with speculative chatter as to what was going on between Citigroup [C] and Morgan Stanley [MS] with respect to a pending deal where MS would buy 51% of Cs Smith Barney brokerage unit.  Rumors were also flowing by then that Bank of America [BAC] was experiencing sizable solvency issues very similar to those that plagued C just weeks ago.      These issues alone were clearly casting a cloud of uncertainty over Wall Street, and trading in US index futures was already indicating sharply lower openings for US equity markets.  And then as if these issues were not enough, an hour before the opening on Wednesday, Retail Sales for December were announced; and they came in at down 2.7%, way worse then the 1.2% slip the Street was anticipating.      The Dow opened off over 150 points Wednesday, and despite a few intraday rally attempts, it never recovered; and in fact, it lost another 100 points in the sessions final 15 minutes.      Then pre-open Thursday, Wall Street was more than jittery over the sell offs reported by all the Asian-Pacific markets during their Thursday sessions; sell offs that were clearly re-sponses to Wall Streets major sell off on Wednesday.  But long before US markets opened, the UK and European markets staged notable improvements after it was announced that the European Central Bank (ECB) was lowering its over-night rate 50 basis points to 2.000%; this on the heels of a 75 bps cut last month.       The latest weekly Jobless Claims data was also released pre-open Thursday; and that read-ing came in at 524,000 claims, up 54,000 claims on a week-to-week basis, and well above the 500,000 rate the Street was expecting.       Predictably, when the opening bell sounded, the sell off that started Wednesday, now refu-eled, continued with a profound vengeance.  And just after the sessions midpoint, the Dow dipped, ever so slightly (3.28 points to be exact), below the 8,000 level.      And this, in Sparkys opinion, is where things suddenly got very interesting.      As Sparky explained in his Post-Close comments last Thursday, it was like watching a 100 firefighters watering down a one-acre brush fire.  If there was ever anyone who does not be-lieve that a Plunge Protection Team (PPT) exists, well they should have been watching then!  The big-block, ask-hitting buying was so intense, those in control (you devil Hank!) not only brought the Dow back up over 8,000, but also managed to recover the 200 points lost ear-lier in the day, and then some.  So true to form, according to the evening news Thursday, the Dow as up 12 points for the day; this as if nothing else had ever happened.        Dont you love this day-to-day deception?!       This clearly manipulative action on Thursday, not to mention a very similar recovery in late November 2008, leaves Sparky thoroughly convinced that 8,000 is a very, very crucial level on the Dow; a level below which a slew of financial institutions  including some gigantic in-surers  will have to mark their liquid assets to market.   Oh my; what a mess!       Then pre-open on Friday, Industrial Production data for December was released.  While the Street was anticipating a month-to-month slide of 1.0%, the actual decline came in twice as big at 2.0%.  As for overall Capacity Utilization throughout this once-great nations factories, few-remaining mills, and mines; the reading for December came in at 73.6%; down sharply from Novembers 75.4% level, and a full percentage point below the 74.6% level the Street expected.      But although this declining production trend may someday be viewed as a tell-tale sign of the impending recession, such perception was not the case Friday; as the Dow closed up 69 points.      Looking at the holiday-abbreviated trading week ahead of us, Sparkys here to tell you that American investors should be scared to death, their investments right now should be of the sideline variety (short-term Treasury and Agency paper), and they shouldnt even think about investing long in US equities until the steep ongoing slide in US real estate values not only flattens, but actually changes direction.  And Sparky suspects that we wont be seeing that point until very late in 2010, if in this centurys first decade at all.      And as for all the manipulation thats been happening over the past year now, it is Sparkys opinion that unless cronies within the Bush administration are willing to truly fess up and admit to the Obama team the real extent to which they have been rigging Wall Street, the new Obama boys literally wont stand the chance of a snowball in hell against the hedge funds and other similarly-structured foes.  Wow, what a mess!       Among the biggest news developments over the trading break, British government officials have been meeting all weekend met with the management of the countrys leading banks and seem about ready to announce a second bailout plan where Britain will essentially be guaranteeing $ 298 billion in bad bank paper.  The UK and European stock markets initially rallied on this news early in their Monday sessions.  But by the close on Monday, most UK and European markets were off to the tune of about one percent.      Now as Americans prepare for an Inauguration Day that will top all those that preceded it, Sparkys hesitant, given that festive backdrop, to predict that the US markets will crash on Tuesday.  But without hesitation Sparky will go right out on the limb and predict a down week for Wall Street.      Looking ahead, Sparky thinks people need to view the concept of change in its proper per-spective.  And along those lines, while the new administration brings with it many new faces, the problems plaguing the positions these people will fill have not changed; and neither will the limitations now plaguing positions change.      As an example, the Federal Reserve can do only two things to influence the US economy; it (1) can change over-night interest rates, and (2) it can change the supply of cash in the sys-tem.  Now sure, on any given day the Fed can claim its doing a bunch of other crap; but when all is said and done, everything the Fed does either changes rate or changes money supply.      So with over-night rates already at zero, there obviously only one thing left for thoroughly-confused Fed Chief ban Bernanke to do  print more money, And a change of people in Washington DC will not change that. So change or no change, thats exactly what Ben will do, print money; just watch!        Sincerely,       Sparky      PS - -  In Sparkys opinion, the word foreclosures will be back in the headlines for months to come.  And along these lines, do expect to hear more and more rhetoric in the days, weeks, and months ahead about how the balance of the TARP funds will be aimed at Main St.  But the problem with that tired old vote-gathering promise is that properties on Main St are fast becoming just as worthless as properties on Wall St.        From:  http://recentmarketaction.com/
