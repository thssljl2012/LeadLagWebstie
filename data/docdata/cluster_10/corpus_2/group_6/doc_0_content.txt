 Heres one of the best articles Ive read on the real cause of the finantial melt down. Seems a 20 something hot shot MBA from one of the prestiegious colleges that was responsible for its creation.       How Credit Default Swaps Became a Timebomb   Newsweek Business   Newsweek.com       JPMorgan was the first bank to make a big bet on credit default swaps. It built up a &amp;quot;swaps&amp;quot; desk in the mid-'90s and  hired young math and science grads from schools like MIT and Cambridge  to create a market for the complex instruments. Within a few years, the credit default swap (CDS) became the hot financial instrument, the safest way to parse out risk while maintaining a steady return.      Brickell and his JPMorgan colleagues  didn't realize they were creating a monster.  Today, the economy is teetering and Wall Street is in ruins, thanks in no small part to the beast they unleashed 14 years ago. The country's biggest insurance company, AIG, had to be bailed out by American taxpayers after it defaulted on $14 billion worth of credit default swaps it had made to investment banks, insurance companies and scores of other entities.      One of the earliest CDS deals came out of JPMorgan in December 1997, when the firm put into place the idea hatched in Boca Raton. It essentially took 300 different loans, totaling $9.7 billion, that had been made to a variety of big companies like Ford, Wal-Mart and IBM, and cut them up into pieces known as &amp;quot;tranches&amp;quot; (that's French for &amp;quot;slices&amp;quot;). The bank then identified the riskiest 10 percent tranche and sold it to investors in what was called the Broad Index Securitized Trust Offering, or Bistro for short. The Bistro was put together by Terri Duhon, at the time a  25-year-old MIT graduate  working on JPMorgan's credit swaps desk in New York.
