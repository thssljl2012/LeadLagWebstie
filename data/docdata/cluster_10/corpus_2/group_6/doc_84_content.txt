 So in theory one day we should get the money back.  However, the stock of these banks has gone down.  Hopefully the stock will go back up.    Recall that the TARP money did not go to purchase Troubled Assets as was originally planed (so far).  That plan meant that we'd purchase some of the loans from the banks.  Then we'd sell those troubled assets to recover our money. If these sales were made at the right time, we wouldn't lose too much.    The big question is what banks like CITI did with the money.  I worry that the money went to the 400 trillion dollar derivative market which is nothing but a black hole.
