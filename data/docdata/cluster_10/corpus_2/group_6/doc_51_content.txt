Of couse they managed to lose about 10 billion of their own money last year.  - buzman   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   So now I can say I'm with Bank of America instead of Merrill Lynch?  What difference does it make to me?  We recently moved our accounts to Franklin, TN from Knoxville, TN because our financial adviser quit and started working for Wachovia.  I guess she's now working for Wells Fargo instead of Wachovia?     Our money is all in index funds and is doing okay.  We didn't lose as much percentage wise as some people we know.  My friends uncle that has millions in GE stock lost literally several million dollars on paper.  He's in his late 60's.   He's still rich though.  He's all alone and doesn't go anywhere or do anything anyway.  He just sits at home and watches the stock market all day.   He's a slave to his money.     Art
