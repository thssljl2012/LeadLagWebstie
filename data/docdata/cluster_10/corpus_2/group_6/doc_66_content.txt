  NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The cost of insuring Bank of America's  debt with credit default swaps rose on Thursday, a day after reports that the bank is close to getting billions of dollars more in federal support.  Five-year credit default swaps on Bank of America rose by 30 basis points to 210 basis points, or $210,000 a year to protect $10 million of debt, according to data from Phoenix Partners Group.  A person familiar with Bank of America's talks for additional support said the bank has struggled to digest its Jan 1 buyout of former Wall Street brokerage Merrill Lynch and that Merrill's fourth quarter losses exceeded expectations.    http://uk.reuters.com/article/marketsNewsUS/idUKN155132...
