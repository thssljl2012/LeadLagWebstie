I'm with ya on the 7am gulp. BAC is in 50% of American households in one form or another- If bank of America should fail, I'm thinking that the entire market goes with it- I mean who would ever invest again in any financial institution if BAC [ with the goverment's full support] failed ? That said- I can easily see all the financials dropping lower and staying low and dividend-less for several years. But, luckily we have a huge short position here and they can really move the stock when they feel like covering. I'm sure I'll be up early, looking for any hint ... Good luck!
