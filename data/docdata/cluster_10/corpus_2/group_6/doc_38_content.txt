Quote:            Over 8 in 10 corporations have tax havens          http://snipurl.com/aajcq          WASHINGTON (AP)  Eighty-three of the nation's 100 largest corporations, including Citigroup, Bank of America and News Corp., had subsidiaries in offshore tax havens in 2007, and some of the companies received federal bailout funding, a government watchdog said Friday.    The Government Accountability Office released a report that said Bank of America Inc., Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley all had more than 100 units in countries that maintain low or no taxes. The three financial institutions were included in the $700 billion financial bailout approved by Congress........ more ..........                  So they are failing and tens of thousands are going to lose their jobs an you're happy that Obama is going to go after them to tax them out of existence?  Are you of right mind?
