                        The Task of Pushing on a String is a Tough one; and understandably, some do it better than others.      And along these lines, Sparky's got to admit that president-elect Obama is far, far better than most at doing it, especially on national television.       But that being said; lets face it, the poor guy is still pushing on a string.       In Sparky's opinion, the markets look not only hesitant, but also sort of wound up and poised to drop like a rock.      8,000 on the Dow seems to be the latest PPT trigger point; the spot where always-a-greedy-banker Hank Paulson and his black-eyed buddy Neel, which rhymes with eel, will spring into action with all those big-block ask hits. And predictably, they always hit the shares of Bank of America, Citigroup, and JP Morgan Chase the hardest; this because they're all components of the DJIA, and thus move the index promptly.      Sparky is of the opinion that right about now levels below 8,000 on the Dow cause serious &amp;quot;reserve&amp;quot; issues for certain popular giants within the insurance industry; and that a drop significantly below this 8,000 level will result in credit-rating downgrades, industry-wide needs to raise additional capital, and perhaps even more government bailouts.      So stay tuned; and at least for now, safely sidelined ~       Sparky
