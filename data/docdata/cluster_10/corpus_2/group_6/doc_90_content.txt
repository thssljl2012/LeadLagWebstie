       Yeah, but ... who's spreading this stuff? &lt;g&gt;   http://jessescrossroadscafe.blogspot.com/2009/01/bank-of-america-asks-for-more.html   The hottest rumor on Wall Street today was that the government  was planning to effectively nationalize Citigroup Inc. and  Bank of America Corp., perhaps as early as this weekend.  ....  If true, they would nationalize all major derivative players except for JPM (and WFC, but that's another story). The dollar is in trouble. Well, maybe that would cancel the contracts, except with foreigners - the Fed is one counterparty, can't  bankrupt itself. It can't get bankrupt, period. -g-
