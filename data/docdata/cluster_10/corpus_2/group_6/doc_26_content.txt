           Advertisements [ ? ]                         Quick re-fresher:  John Thain was head of Merrill Lynch, sold that  to BOA, was not honest with BOA about the amount of debt Merrill Lynch had included in the sale, but managed to build a gazillion dollar office at BOA before he  was fired 3 months  later.  Up to the moment of his forced resignation, Thain was a darling on Wall Street.  Briefly: President and co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs from 1999 to 2004, then on to NYSE to replace the previous CEO, Dick Grasso, who was fired after it was revealed that he had essentially rewarded himself $140 million in deferred compensation. Since Thain's  departure early in 2007, NYSE stock has plummeted 72 percent.  Thain  then moved to Merrill to replace the guy who got blamed for Merrill's sub-prime mess. Thain was then the  second highest-paid executive in 2007, according to the Associated Press, amounting to more than $83 million.  He ran Merrill into the ground, racked up debt,  BOA used government money to buy Merrill, and bought more Merrill debt than it realized.
