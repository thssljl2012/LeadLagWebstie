...something must have happened to your copy and pasting as one very important factor is missing in your post (accidently or not):    "Jan. 15 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., the second- largest U.S. bank by assets, said profit fell 76 percent, beating analysts&#146; estimates, as the company navigates the credit crisis with more success than most of its peers."    Yes, they beat the expectations. That is what counts in today's market, the rest you can through in the bin for now as everyone knows we are in a severe recession.    kiir       Price details at 2009-01-15 12:03:35:-  Bid: 138.30, Ask: 138.40, LastTrade: 138.40, Change: -2.60%
