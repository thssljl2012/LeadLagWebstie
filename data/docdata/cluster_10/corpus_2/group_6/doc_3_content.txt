                        To Stabilize Global Banks, First Tame Credit Default Swaps   January 21, 2009      [This article nails it, exceptionally good, imo,    http://us1.institutionalriskanalytics.com/pub/IRAMain.asp]       "Well, the government could simply give Gotham a couple of hundred billion dollars, enough to make it solvent again. But this would, of course, be a huge gift to Gotham's current shareholders - and it would also encourage excessive risk-taking in the future. Still, the possibility of such a gift is what's now supporting Gotham's stock price. A better approach would be to do what the government did with zombie savings and loans at the end of the 1980s: it seized the defunct banks, cleaning out the shareholders. Then it transferred their bad assets to a special institution, the Resolution Trust Corporation; paid off enough of the banks' debts to make them solvent; and sold the fixed-up banks to new owners."       Paul Krugman   "Wall Street Voodoo"   The New York Times    January 18, 2009         Congratulations to President Barack Hussein Obama on assuming the Presidency of the United States. We wish you and yours Godspeed.          A long-time colleague and IRA reader who works for a mostly nationalized UK bank tells the following tale. Upon arriving at Heathrow Airport several weeks ago, he was pulled out of the line by UK immigration authorities and told to sit in a windowless interview room.  After waiting for quite a while, two plain clothes members of the UK immigration service came into the room, sat down and informed the banker that he had made a false statement on his customs declaration.       "Sir, you are not a banker as you have claimed," said one of the immigration officers. "You are in fact an employee of Her Majesty's Government. In future, please ensure that you form is filled out correctly." And they were deadly serious.          Such is the level of public anger and outrage at the moves by the UK government to rescue the few, large players in that nation's banking sector. And there are similar political trends building in the US. Thus the need to fashion a prompt but effective response to the crisis, as none other than Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman outlines above. Simply buying and/or guaranteeing bank assets, without first passing these banks through a receivership, is pointless.  First the market value of the assets and liabilities must be put back into balance, then and only then the banks may be recapitalized.         In our latest report to our advisory clients, we discussed the likely magnitude of the losses to hit the US banking sector in 2009. We had been pondering this issue with respect to Citigroup (NYSE:C), JPMorganChase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) for some while now, but the reports from FBR and, more recently, a draft paper from our friend Nouriel Roubini, forced us to focus on some hard numbers. Registered investment professionals who want information about IRA's confidential advisory service, please contact us directly.          The bad news is that estimates that put aggregate charge-offs for all US banks over the next 12-18 months above $1 trillion are probably in the right neighborhood. The entire banking industry only has $1.5 trillion in capital, so new equity must obviously be provided by Washington and/or private investors.  This is why the UK, US and other affected nations must soon abandon the bailout model championed by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary-designate Tim Geithner, and instead embrace the strategy of resolution and restructuring exemplified by Sheila Bair and her colleagues at the FDIC.          The good news is that much of that loss is going to be concentrated among the largest banks, with C accounting for as much as a quarter of the total all by itself. When you see a 40% loss rate vs. total assets for a relatively simple institutions such as IndyMac, tell us why you would not start at that level with C? Impose a conservative 30% loss rate on C's $1.3 trillion in bank assets and you have wiped out the group's $150 billion in Tier One Risk Based Capital several times over.  The common and preferred of C is toast, in our view.  Restructuring is the only rational choice for C and for Washington.  And maybe, just maybe, the C bond holders will see a modest recovery.          Our long-time estimate of 2x 1990 loss rates for peak charge-offs in 2009 implies that the industry will reach 4% defaults and relatively riskier players like C will be much higher. In 1990-91, Citibank NA peaked around 3.5% charge-offs vs. total loans and leases, almost causing the bank to fail. Some observers believe that had regulators resolved Citibank two decades ago, we would not be facing the same type of financial crisis today.  So now the past is prologue.          But even with all of this red ink in evidence and easily projected, the magnitude of current and prospective charge-offs does not fully explain the crazy, triple-digit volatility of the debt and equity of C and other banks, large and small.  Even the events of the past year, including the failures of Lehman and Bear, do not fully explain why financial names are behaving so erratically, this even after the US government has effectively underwritten the banks' operations. No, the reason for the continued heebie-jeebies in bank equity and debt stems from the unfinished business in the market for credit default swaps or "CDS."          As readers of The IRA know full well, the Fed of New York and the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp have been working for years to address the bank office issues facing CDS, this all the while declaring that there is nothing basically wrong with the CDS market. Strange, then, that as part of the process of rationalizing CDS contracts, nearly half of the outstanding contracts have been torn up in the past year!  This is because, dear friends, when it comes to CDS, clearing is the least of our problems.          The tension with CDS regarding the money centers in particular and banks generally comes from several basic flaws in the ISDA model for these instruments, including the lack of a central counterparty and the issues that arise from this archaic, bilateral market structure. Most crucially, because the Fed still refuses to enforce any type of credit margin discipline over the CDS markets by raising collateral requirements to realistic levels, the short-selling pressure of C and other wounded money centers is magnified many times above the true pool of investors with hedging needs. Yesterday's trading in US bank names is a case in point.          Unlike a centralized exchange where an impartial counterparty holds the cash, the bilateral relationships in the CDS market lead to gross under-collateralization of CDS trades which are, in turn, governed by separate collateral security agreements. This leads to what one participant calls "a dirty float," where counterparties keep minimal collateral with one another and thus nobody is sure whether their contracts are money good. It is thus possible to run short positions against banks or other names and have virtually no collateral backing these trades, both for dealers and their customers.  Why should the citizens of the industrial nations tolerate the existence of this unsafe and unsound market for another moment longer?         By failing to enforce margin limits on CDS leverage while investing new capital in C, BAC and other large banks via the TARP, the Fed and Treasury are essentially trying to fill up a bucket with a hole in the bottom.  Providing new capital to wounded banks is pointless if you are going to allow the remaining street dealers to short bank stocks with impunity and virtually no collateral. To fix the systemic risk issues with the CDS market permanently and also provide a much need additional buttress to the bank rescue efforts by the Fed and Treasury, here is what we would suggest.          First, the Fed and Treasury should prohibit the writing of new CDS on any financial institutions that is participating in the TARP.  Instead, the Fed and Treasury should interpose themselves as counterparties for these names, writing CDS for any and all counterparties and capturing the revenue for the US Treasury. This change can be accomplished unilaterally, without notice or Congressional authority, pursuant to the safety and soundness provisions of 12CFR.  After all, since the government is already effectively backing the liabilities of these insolvent firms, the taxpayer has first claim on any insurance premiums written against such public support. It is absurd for the government to allow private speculators to profit by trading against public-guaranteed liabilities of banks that participate in the TARP. Unfortunately, Chairman Bernanke and his colleagues at the Fed are still not willing (or able politically) to enforce prudential rules on the CDS casino.          Second, the Fed and Treasury, via legislation if necessary, should propose changes to the legal configuration of the CDS contract that will take it away from the OTC FX/interest rate model used by ISDA over the past decade or more.  Regulators should require that CDS contracts be exchange traded, but with collateral and delivery requirements that mirror not the cash settlement world of OTC FX and interest rate OTC contracts, but instead based on the basic model of the exchange traded world of physical commodities, but priced based upon the risk measures used in the insurance industry.         While it is entirely appropriate for exchange traded instruments like the S&amp;P 500, Eurodollar futures, or OTC interest rate swap and currency contracts to settle in cash, allowing cash settlement in CDS has opened a Pandora's Box for bank managers and investors, who must manage both the market and credit risk of dealing in these contracts as de facto central counterparty, while ...
