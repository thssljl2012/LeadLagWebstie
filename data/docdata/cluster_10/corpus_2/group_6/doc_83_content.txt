Treasury and Bank of America near bailout deal Thursday January 15, 7:37 pm ET By Martin Crutsinger, AP Economics Writer Source: Agreement near to provide $15 billion to $20 billion new money to Bank of America http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/090115/bank_of_america_aid.html WASHINGTON (AP) -- A person close to the discussions says that Bank of America and the Treasury Department are near an agreement that will provide $15 billion to $20 billion in new government support to the banking giant. This source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the injection of fresh capital will come from the government's $700 billion rescue fund and will be similar to assistance provided last November to Citigroup. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because the agreement had not been completely finalized. An announcement was expected later Thursday.
