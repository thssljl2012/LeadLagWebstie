       QUOTE = Around the turn of each year forecasts are made for the following year. I find making predictions amidst so much government interventions to be particularly difficult. In addition, we so called experts have a horrendous forecasting record. Just as a reminder: in late December 2007 Barrons published an article titled A bullish call  Wall Streets seers forecast more gains for stocks next year (see Barrons Online, December 17, 2007) in which 12 well-known strategists listed their 2008 earnings estimates and year-end 2008 price targets for the S&amp;amp;P 500.   The estimates were as follows:  Richard Bernstein, Merrill Lynch: 1525,  Thomas Lee, JP Morgan: 1590, Tom McManus, Bank of America: 1625,  Ian Scott, Lehman Brothers:1630,  Larry Adam, Deutsche Bank: 1640,  Abhijit Chakrabortti, MorganStanley: 1650,  Jonathan Morton, Credit Suisse: 1650,  Abby Cohen,Goldman Sachs:1675,  Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup: 1675,  David Bianco, UBS Securities:1700,  Jonathan Golub, Bear Stearns: 1700,  Francois Trahan, ISI Group:1750.   Their 2008 S&amp;amp;P earnings estimates ranged from US$85.30 to US$101.21 per share (the average forecast predicted a climb of 4% to US$92 per share). None of the strategists predicted a recession and Tobias Levkovich believed that stocks were screamingly cheap relative to bonds (at the time the S&amp;amp;P 500 was at 1464). Similarly, Abby Cohen noted that the S&amp;amp;P 500 was trading at just 15.6 times average 2008 estimated earnings - well below the average P/E of 18.6 times earnings during periods over the past 57 years when inflation was at similarly muted levels.   For 2009, these experts now expect the S&amp;amp;P to increase to around 1100.
