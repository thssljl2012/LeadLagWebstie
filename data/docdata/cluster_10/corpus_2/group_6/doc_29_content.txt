Certainly not appropriate for Fannie or Freddie. They were GSEs, government sponsored enterprises. Didn't that mean the government sponsored and backed them? That they couldn't possibly go out of business? Anyone owning the stock or the preferred found out the horrible answer to that question.     As for Lehman Brothers, WaMu and Countrywide, the assumption, and the wrong one, was that they were too big to fail. Certainly they wouldn't be allowed to go under. Their failure would hurt the credibility of large institutions, the trust Americans had in thrifts and lenders. Wrong again. They are gone. Countrywide has been swallowed by Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), which now is having serious troubles of its own. WaMu, after it went bankrupt, was bought by JP Morgan Chase but the WaMu shareholders got nothing. Lehman Brothers went out like a small fire in a hurricane.        thread start
