  LOL I still say the 4 billion Merrill Lynch's CEO gave out in bonuses was the worst.       Wake up America and take all your money out of the stock market and the major banks Citi Group, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Chase and New York METLIFE and put the money into local banks in CD's so they can loan to local businesses not pay themselves billions of your dollars in bonuses.       Please everyone SELL, SELL, SELL before it's too late.
