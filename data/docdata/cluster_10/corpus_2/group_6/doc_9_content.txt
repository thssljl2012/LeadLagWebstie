WSJ: BofA Woes Put Pressure on Lewis By DAN FITZPATRICK and JOANN S. LUBLIN Bank of America Corp.'s handling of its acquisition of troubled Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. has put Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis on the hot seat with irate shareholders. Among those disappointed in the steep decline in the bank's stock are two veterans who helped Mr. Lewis rise to the top. Hugh McColl Jr., Bank of America's buccaneering former chairman and chief executive, who picked Mr. Lewis as his successor, and James Hance, the bank's former chief financial officer, privately have expressed disappointment in certain decisions made by Bank of America during this financial crisis, according to people close to the men. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123292661964113805.html?mod=googlenews_wsj
