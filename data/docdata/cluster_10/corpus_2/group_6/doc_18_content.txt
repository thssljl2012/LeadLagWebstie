positive spin on financials: Be careful. Wishing for a First National Bad Bank, something I have written and called for in these pages endlessly, would certainly be terrific for the bank stocks, particularly Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. It is something I thought we were going to do earlier, something I thought TARP would be molded into, but the uncreative Treasury department and Fed didn't get their act together to do it. But why be careful? Because after they have all ramped on this, remember that there could be a cost to the Bad Bank. If Obama is smart, he will extract something big for staying in the game, maybe huge warrant deals, lots of dilution. I suggest there will be big short-covering and big selling of the ProShares UltraShort Financials, etc. I sure hope so -- I own JPMorgan and Wells Fargo for Action Alerts PLUS,... Jim Cramer ( I usually wouldn't post anything of his because he's such a contrarian indicator , but )
