The DT is saying that HMG are doing figures with the Banks (surprised if they were not) and with the noises GB is making I agree it likely they will want to follow on with 'material action' quickly. However, bailout has become a pejorative expression. If the term 'constructive supportive assistance' were substituted, it gives a different perspective. Same applies to toxic bank and so on. If they are going to swap opaque assets for hard cash at a price that isnt heavily discounted compared with the Banks' marked price, it may be a good move. Sometimes material action gives a clearer route map even if it feels negative. Even dilution wouldnt worry me because I would rather have one share in a viable company than two shares in nothing. Its the potential future value that counts to me not the present sp. Feel quite mellow and listening out for views from my Shaolin monks.
