I'm not accusing Chrysler of misusing the money, I am saying it is a company with no future, and is therefore WORTHLESS collateral for a loan. Bank of America and AIG are not.       If we could snap our fingers and Fiat platforms could be underneath Chryslers tomorrow, and Fiats in Chrysler showrooms, it would be worth seeing if this thing had a shot. But neither company has the five years of waiting time that is needed before this deal bears any fruit.
