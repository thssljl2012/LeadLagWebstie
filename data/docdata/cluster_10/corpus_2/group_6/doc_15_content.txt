I agree with DaDrake.   This consolidation is terrific.  Let's get a bunch more of these mergers done... In fact some recent studies show that there is no credit crisis for the majority of banks (using the Fed's own numbers!):  http://mast-economy.blogspot.com/2008/12/no-credit ...

Meanwhile, by the Fed's own count, the middle tier and little guys who didn't expose themselves to the toxic assets continue to do quite well. (They are strong, growing, and have no liquidity problems at all.  GNE  http://goodnewseconomist.com  (no gloom and doom here)
