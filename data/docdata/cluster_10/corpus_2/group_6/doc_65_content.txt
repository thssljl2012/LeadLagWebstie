Most purchases like this would have had out clauses should the buyer discover new information.&lt;&lt;&lt;         Material change clause ... there was no material change in Merrill Lynch since September.  They were headed for bankruptcy in short order then, and nothing changed.         Name one deal where a company successfully walked in a similar circumstance.  Hell, even Lonestar had to close on Accredited Home Lenders year before last and they basically went bankrupt between the time the deal was signed and the time they were forced to close.  No way BofA could walk and this falls right the lap of Ken for doing the deal in the first place.  Stop trying to make excuses for him.          http://www.forbes.com/markets/2007/08/13/accredited-lone-update-markets-equity-cx_af_0813markets28.html            Accredited Won't Let Lone Star Go        Andrew Farrell   ,  08.13.07, 4:10 PM ET                      &gt;&gt;&gt;I also think it is very likely the Feds were twisting arms.

No minutes, no tapes, no notes ... ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  We have NO IDEA what went on in that room and neither does anyone else.  Hell, even Congress is having to threaten Subpeonas to get simple stuff like the contract Treasury excuted when they gave away $$$ 350 BILLION in a matter of ninety days.                      thread start
