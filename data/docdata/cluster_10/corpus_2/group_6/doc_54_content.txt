Did you see that Merrill reported a $15 billion dollar loss AND they gave their key employees between $3-4 billion in bonuses in December? They did it in December knowing full well there was going to be a huge loss to report in Jan, when bonuses are typically given out. What is wrong with these guys....they took our taxpayer bailout money and spread it among themselves.
