@dalittle - That's not true. They didn't make that argument. If it was over 9000 banks rather than just 6 or so, the pressure would have been greater because the banks would be less able to deal with a crisis.   Further, the 'too big to fail' is a phrase they would NOT want to use since it applies to one of two solutions the FDIC implements when a bank becomes insolvent.   One solution is dissolution of the bank. The alternative solution is banks that are 'too big to fail' are simply taken over by the government and all the management is FIRED, not given a bailout.
