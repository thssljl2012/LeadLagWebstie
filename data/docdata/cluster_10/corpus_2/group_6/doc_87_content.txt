The FDIC nationalized the insolvent IndyMac and then sold it off to private investors six months later. This didn't create a one world government and neither will the FDIC nationalizing Citibank and Bank of America and then selling them off in a new IPO. Both banks are insolvent and the shareholders and bondholder have negative value. The taxpayer should not be giving welfare to bank shareholders in the style of a Bush-like one world government.
