I really dont think so. I think all the major banks in the US are bankrupt and have been for at least a year. The problem is that most of them have assets that are hard to value. The subprime loans have a snowballing rate of default.. so you only have to write off the bad loans as they go bad. And most banks wont write off more because it makes them look bad and undercapitalized. But then then the real estate market gets swamped with defaults.. lowering values... this leads to more defaults. Then they have to write-down more, and it spirals more, and more, and more.        On top of this, the banks were selling defaults swaps and other derivatives on alot of these assets... and those swaps keep getting exercised as the defaults hit... and the banks have billions or trillions of these potential liabilities, which again keep blowing up as they get triggered.. like oil drums in a warehouse fire.        I think if you did fair value of all assets vs liabilities on the big US banks, all the top banks are bankrupt, and some are probably worth negative trillion or less.
