There is now no doubt that the world economy has entered a significant correction. Most likely, it will be long and hard.     Stephen Roach, in the Financial Times, says America may face a &#145;lost decade,&#146; like Japan in the &#145;90s. Actually, it looks to us that Japan has suffered two lost decades... it&#146;s almost the end of the &#145;00s and its economy still hasn&#146;t recovered. And with the yen rising &#150; investors are unwinding their yen-based carry trades &#150; Japan&#146;s manufacturers are finding it more difficult to sell than ever.     All around the globe, the news is grim. US retail sales &#150; taking out autos &#150; are the worst they&#146;ve been in more than half a century. Chinese exports are collapsing.     Tiffany&#146;s says holiday sales were bad; the rich are cutting back along with everyone else. Overall, US retail sales posted their 6th consecutive month of decline in December.     Meanwhile, the banks are insolvent.     &#147;Banks in need of even more bailout money,&#148; says a headline in the New York Times. Analysts say the banks need between $1 and $1.2 trillion more to stay in business.     HSBC says it needs $30 billion in the near-term. Bank of America is asking for more too.     Oh my... oh my.... what to do?     Gotta fight this fire! But how? Fight fire with fire! All over the world people suffer from the mistakes they made in the go-go years. They spent too much. They borrowed too much. They paid too much. Now, all those bad debts, bad investments, and bad balance sheets are burning up &#150; scorching fingers all over the planet.     So what do the feds do to try to fix this problem? Fight fire with fire! Throw some more tinder onto the blaze... get people to borrow, spend and speculate even more!     *** It&#146;s a question of faith. Those with little faith in their public officials will agree with Stephen Roach; most likely, the world economy, led by the US, is entering a &#147;lost decade&#148; of recession, bear market and deflation.     But here at the Daily Reckoning we give the devil his due; if the feds want to really want to destroy the dollar, we believe they&#146;ll be able to pull it off. Just give them time.     To that end, we are still rolling on the floor over the proposal to create a &#145;bad bank&#146; that will buy up bad investments. We thought the banks already had plenty of bad investments of their own. This proposal is really just another back-fire in what has become a worldwide blaze. The feds have already set several other back-fires &#150; mostly &#145;cash for trash&#146; programs designed to enrich Wall Street and the financial sector at the expense of the rest of the society.     And today&#146;s news tells us that the European Central Bank is falling in line with its counterparts in Britain and America by lowering rates. The US central bank is already down to zero. The BoE and the ECB are on their way.     But the real key to the feds&#146; game is neither bailing out the banks nor offering more credit. Even if their balance sheets were repaired, it will be a long time &#150; probably a generation &#150; before bankers want to lend so recklessly again. And it will probably be at least a generation before people want to speculate on houses again. No, the real key is to undermine the dollar. As long as the dollar is going up against financial assets and consumer goods, people will neither borrow, lend nor spend. Instead, they&#146;re going to hold onto every buck as if it were their last.     That&#146;s why the bankers are experimenting with &#147;qualitative easing&#148; or &#147;credit easing,&#148; as Bernanke called it this week. These are code words for printing money. Rather than recapitalize the bankers, the central banks buy debt directly from the government. This permits the government to finance its stimulus plans without putting pressure on the debt market.     http://fleetstreetinvest.co.uk/daily-reckonin    Price details at 2009-01-16 11:21:28:-  Bid: 555.50, Ask: 570.50, LastTrade: 555.60, Change: 1.94%
