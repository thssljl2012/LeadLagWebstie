       This is a pretty good summary. As I said on another thread, Ken Lewis wouldn't know a due diligence (that's due, not Dew) if it bit him in the ass. He reinforces the stereotype of Southerners as dumb rednecks. Buying Merrill was joining the club.   Of course, the Merrill deal alone isnt to blame for the mess at Bank of America. All of the worlds banks are suffering. And CEOs overpay for acquisitions all the time.  But the Merrill deal is an outlieran awful deal at inception that just keeps on getting worse.  The optics of Merrill executives, Tom Montag and Peter Kraus pocketing tens of millions of dollars in payouts were bad. That little tussle over Thains bonus was unseemly. But nothing is as bad as Merrill posting a staggering $15 billion loss in the fourth quarter.   To uncover that two-thirds of these losses arose after the Dec. 5 shareholder vote is not only inexplicable, it is inexcusable. By November and December, everyone on Wall Street assumed the worst. Except, apparently, Ken Lewis and his team at Bank of America.  BofA claims it conducted an excruciating level of due diligence on Merrill Lynch. But given Lewiss surprise over Merrills losses in December how can that be?
