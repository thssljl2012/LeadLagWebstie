But the losses at AIG came overwhelmingly because the insurer was selling default protection to banks on their super-senior CDOs. In other words, AIG was bailed out largely because if it hadn't been, many of the world's largest banks would have found themselves to be insolvent overnight. The banks were the prudent ones, insuring themselves against loss with the world's largest insurer; it was AIG which wrote more insurance than it could realistically handle. And yes, Merrill Lynch lost money on the CDS basis trade. But that trade, again, involves buying credit protection, not selling it. The problem was that not that the CDSs had soured, so much as that the CDSs hadn't soured enough.
