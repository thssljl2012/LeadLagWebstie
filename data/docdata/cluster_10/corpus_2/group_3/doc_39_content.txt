  Skrybe did advise AGAINST speculative stocks and rightfully so. The best money managers always say to do your due diligence and often repeat the mantra of FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS. Such an analysis can greatly improve one&amp;#039;s knowledge of the future performance of a firm. But, fuck these individual stocks, go for sector ETF&amp;#039;s (I like biotech right now) and ETF&amp;#039;s managed by firms like Vanguard, Barclays and the like. That&amp;#039;s a whole different issue though.       The point to get out of all this is that slowly but surely, we will see recovery, but that it will take time.
