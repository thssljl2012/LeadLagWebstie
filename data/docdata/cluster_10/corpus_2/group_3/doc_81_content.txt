Broker action     Goldman Sachs took a &amp;quot;cautious&amp;quot; stance on solar companies, lowering First Solar (FSLR) to conviction sell from buy and SunPower (SPWRA) to sell from buy. &amp;quot;The risk of oversupply in the solar market will soon become a reality as considerably less generous demand subsidies take hold just as a wave of supply and tight financing hit the market,&amp;quot; Goldman said.           Bank of America (BAC) said late Monday its third-quarter profit slid below analysts&amp;#039; estimates, and announced a dividend cut and stock offering aimed at positioning it for an eventual recovery. The company said it earned $1.18 billion, or 15 cents a share in the quarter, a 68% fall from the $3.70 billion, or 82 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Analysts had expected earnings of 61 cents a share.   The Reserve Bank of Australia unexpectedly slashed its key lending rate a full percentage point to 5%, adding to speculation that major central banks are preparing a rare round of coordinated interest-rate cuts if conditions don&amp;#039;t improve. Meanwhile, overnight and short-term lending rates in world money markets remain well above official central bank interest rates, amid signs commercial banks have virtually stopped lending money to each other in the crucial interbank market.   The U.S. Federal Reserve is reportedly looking at getting into unsecured lending, an extreme step that could allow it to directly purchase commercial paper, according to a report in the Financial Times. The report said the Fed had never done so in its history, but doing so could allow it to participate in the frozen inter-bank money market and the contracting commercial paper market. The Fed doesn&amp;#039;t believe it has the legal mandate to make unsecured loans, so it would need the Treasury to guarantee any losses. The Fed had said in a statement on Monday that &amp;quot;the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department are consulting with market participants on ways to provide additional support for term unsecured funding markets.   Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) said it plans to spin off its manufacturing operations to a new joint venture, Foundry Co., with an Abu Dhabi investment firm.

AMD said it would contribute to the venture its manufacturing facilities, and ATIC will pay $2.1 billion for its stake.   Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW) said Tuesday that as a result of slowing end markets and the reclassification of some earnings as discontinued operations it has cut its third-quarter and full-year earnings forecast for continuing operations.
