Obviously the insurance  &amp;amp;gt; companies are in grave danger here from off balance sheet swap transactions  &amp;amp;gt; on mortgagees.     Probably not. What AIG was doing was fairly unique, IIRC. What insurance  companies *probably* have done is invest part of their reserves in CDOs.    JG     &amp;amp;gt;  &amp;amp;gt;
