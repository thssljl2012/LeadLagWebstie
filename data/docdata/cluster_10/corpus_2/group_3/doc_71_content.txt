     Gold Slips as Stocks Rally, Commodities Bounce; Leveraged Betting on Gold Shrinks Once Again                   By: Adrian Ash, BullionVault                                                                                                                                                          -- Posted Monday, 20 October  2008     Digg This Article           Source: GoldSeek.com                 London     Gold Market Report            THE SPOT PRICE OF GOLD    gave back two-thirds of a 3.4% rally early Monday, trading below $795 an ounce as Asian stock markets closed sharply higher and US Treasury bonds fell.......          .....Hedge funds and other large speculators  bereft of the cheap credit and investment-bank loans needed to finance their derivatives trading  have more than halved the number of bullish bets they hold since mid-July, back when world stock markets also turned sharply lower, knocking fully one-quarter off the S&amp;amp;amp;P index of America&amp;#039;s 500 largest corporations inside three months.        &amp;amp;quot;Gold Prices certainly look much lower now as compared to a week ago,&amp;amp;quot; noted Adrian Koh at Phillip Futures in Singapore to Reuters earlier, &amp;amp;quot;and I guess some people will be looking at picking up physical metal.         &amp;amp;quot;[But] from a technical view, I am not convinced that the selling is over. ..With Gold Prices heading towards the downside, it simply means that funds and investors are moving money out of the markets.&amp;amp;quot;        The shrinkage of leveraged Gold Futures trading is being matched, however, by rapid growth in exchange-traded gold funds.        The very largest Gold ETF  the SPDR trust for US investors  has grown by 16% since the start of September. Its fellow ETF provider here in London, ETF Securities, says it saw $200 million flows into its &amp;amp;quot;physically backed&amp;amp;quot; gold fund last week alone.        &amp;amp;quot;In volatile times like these,&amp;amp;quot; said the group&amp;#039;s CEO, Nik Bienkowski, to Reuters earlier, &amp;amp;quot;gold comes into its own. It is used as a store of value, a safe haven and has no correlation with equities.&amp;amp;quot;        ETF Securities has been at pains to differentiate its &amp;amp;quot;physically-backed&amp;amp;quot; trust-fund offerings from those products hit by the collapse of AIG, the giant US insurance company which stood as guarantor was for its leveraged and inverse commodity plays.        The company&amp;#039;s Derivative Commodity Offerings ceased trading for a period in late Sept., leaving investors unable to buy or sell as the largest traders refused to make a price.         Meantime in Zurich, Switzerland today, private bank Julius Baer said it is also launching a &amp;amp;quot;physical gold fund&amp;amp;quot;, because &amp;amp;quot;the precious metal becomes increasingly important in times of uncertainty.&amp;amp;quot;         Julius Baer&amp;#039;s own shares have lost more than half their value in the last 12 months. Assets under management shrank by one-tenth in the first six months of &amp;#039;08.          Adrian Ash - full story:  http://news.goldseek.com/BullionVault/1224509154.php
