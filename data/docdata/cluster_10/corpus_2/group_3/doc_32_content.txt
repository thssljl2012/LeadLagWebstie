Kind of interesting Bernanke is addressing AIG, cds and the bailout in real time right now in a press conference.  My source must be pretty good, as I posted this a couple days ago.        CNBC was interviewing bulls.  I&amp;#039;d have to agree with them long-term, as we are closer to a bottom than a top, but we&amp;#039;ve got a couple more legs down.  I expect a healthy bounce here, but the mid-term charts look like they&amp;#039;re breaking down.  And I&amp;#039;m not a chartist, but another 10%-20% decline after the bounce would not surprise me.  I want to see NO bulls before I jump in.        Meanwhile, clients in index-based annuities and life insurance contracts relish in S P 500 pullbacks, as their reset points are lowered, setting up a great snapback over the next year.
