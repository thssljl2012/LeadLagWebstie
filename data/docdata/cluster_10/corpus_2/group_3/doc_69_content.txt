         Hi folks  Thanks for the comments so far.   http://www.ing.com/group/stockticker.jsp?lang=EN&amp;amp;amp;menopt=...   The shares took a 20% hit in the US yesterday. I am basically comapring the safety of ING deposits over the Euro 100,000 guarantee, compared with UK banks such as Barclays. The Dutch Government is, I believe, saying it will support their banks (although ABN and Algemene are now in the capable hands of RBS :-). I can read Dutch, but haven&amp;#039;t found any links to this. Generally, Holland will follow Germany in these sort of things.  Let&amp;#039;s be careful out there  MrB
