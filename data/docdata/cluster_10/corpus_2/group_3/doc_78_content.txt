          http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/newsanalysis/ratings/1044152... ... - Excerpted from Paul&amp;#039;s link: Even though it is the world&amp;#039;s largest brewer, InBev didn&amp;#039;t have all of the $60.8 billion needed to purchase Anheuser-Busch. So InBev arranged to borrow $45 billion from a syndicate of banks including Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi (MTU Quote - Cramer on MTU - Stock Picks), Banco Santander (STD Quote - Cramer on STD - Stock Picks), Barclays Capital (BCS Quote - Cramer on BCS - Stock Picks), BNP Paribas (BNPQY Quote - Cramer on BNPQY - Stock Picks), Deutsche Bank (DB Quote - Cramer on DB - Stock Picks), ING Groep (ING Quote - Cramer on ING - Stock Picks), JPMorgan Chase (JPM Quote - Cramer on JPM - Stock Picks), Mizuho (MFG Quote - Cramer on MFG - Stock Picks), Fortis Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS Quote - Cramer on RBS - Stock Picks).  - I am surprised that so many banks are involved.
