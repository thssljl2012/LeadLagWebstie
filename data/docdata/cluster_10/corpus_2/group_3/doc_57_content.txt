That said WB&amp;#039;s&amp;amp;nbsp;conduct was&amp;amp;nbsp;egregiously immoral and unethical&amp;amp;nbsp;.While operating safely under the umbrella of C Mon-Thur, the&amp;amp;nbsp;CEO was collaberating behind the scenes with WFC to kill the deal with C. C steped up to the plate on Sunday while WFC did not commit until late into the night Thursday.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    In&amp;amp;nbsp;an hour of crisis WFC walked away last weekend and WB made a pact with C thereby gaining safe harbour from bankruptcy which would have ensued&amp;amp;nbsp;the following day (monday).&amp;amp;nbsp;Kind of reminds me of&amp;amp;nbsp;Lehmen&amp;#039;s when the only suitor&amp;amp;nbsp;Barclays walked. Barclays knew full well they would pick up the assets they&amp;amp;nbsp; liked for a mere pittance in an&amp;amp;nbsp;LEH bankruptcy and which they did. If C would have walked last Sunday WB would have followed same course.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    I dont think the book is closed&amp;amp;nbsp;and C may revive the deal, to the chagrin of the WB CEO who henceforth will be viewed as hostile, Iwith a more favourable treatment of the shareholders. I&amp;amp;nbsp; would hate to see &amp;amp;nbsp;WFC&amp;#039;s opportunism rewarded.&amp;amp;nbsp;What a sordid mess.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;         thread start
