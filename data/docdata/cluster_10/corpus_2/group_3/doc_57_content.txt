Quote:   The right view of the financial mess is that an enormous fraction of subprime lending should never have occurred in the first place. Someone has to pay for that. That someone should not be, and does not need to be, the U.S. taxpayer.  The quote that you linked from Jeffrey Miron is certainly thought provoking, and worth conisderation.       Mr. Miron says that the response to the crisis should be bankruptcy, not bailout, and his points have validity.   The obvious alternative to a bailout is letting troubled financial institutions declare bankruptcy. Bankruptcy means that shareholders typically get wiped out and the creditors own the company.      Bankruptcy does not mean the company disappears; it is just owned by someone new (as has occurred with several airlines). Bankruptcy punishes those who took excessive risks while preserving those aspects of a businesses that remain profitable. That approach has merit.  But we should also keep in mind that it is not only the shareholders who get wiped out in bankruptcy, but quite often the creditors as well.  For a large insurance company such as AIG, that might include holders of annuities and insurance contracts and a lot of ordinary people.  Also company  dont  always survive bankruptcy. A string of large bankruptcies will have a domino effect on creditors down the line in other firms.        Mr. Miron believes that the damage would be limited to a few individuals and a few firms.  In this particular financial crisis, I believe he may be rather too optimistic.  I think it would be hard to keep the damage from spiraling out of control, ending up hurting not just the big firms which failed, but all of us, both here and abroad.  Its a risky strategy.       This part I can certainly agree with:    So what should the government do? Eliminate those policies that generated the current mess. This means, at a general level, abandoning the goal of home ownership independent of ability to pay. This means, in particular, getting rid of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, along with policies like the Community Reinvestment Act that pressure banks into subprime lending.  Yet it is those very social policies that Congress loves because they benefit their constituents, at least in the short run.
