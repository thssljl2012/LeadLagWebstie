                                      Hello ianx,        Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  ianx                         Being a bank shareholder, I feel sorry for myself....                        I have, ( last few days ) once again become a share holder in banks.      I have held bank stock before and have done very well.      This time around I was a lot more cautious, I brought into Barclays, purchased some Lloyds, ( not much ), Chartered as well,  purchased penny stocks like Woolworths, ( before Allan did ), food and chemical stock too, I hold gold as well.      I have a large porfolio of property I thank the day, as  a family, as a landlord we never got in to buy-to-let or anything like that, simply buying and selling or buying and keeping and always our money.

We all had the chance to sell our shares 18 months ago when they were at ten times the price they are today. We all got some very nice dividend payments over the last decade. Those were the rewards for the extra risks we took with out money.                     I was repeating what I have read, I was wondering why others thought some share holders deserved a hammering.         Quote:                         It&amp;#039;s easy to look at the past and decide to hold on hoping that the price might one day get back to where it was, but really what you should be doing is looking at the bank&amp;#039;s current state, and looking at what your shares are currently worth, and asking yourself: &amp;amp;quot;If I had that amount as cash in my hand today, would I invest it in RBS/HBOS/LLoyds?&amp;amp;quot;. If the answer is &amp;amp;quot;Yes&amp;amp;quot; then hold, else sell up and put your money somewhere else.                     I so very doubt, at least in the three taken over things will ever get to 06 or pre 06 again, in fact they won&amp;#039;t but five 6 years from now, I see no reason why Lloyds won&amp;#039;t reach 4.50 a share.        Quote:                         Historically one of the reasons for holding bank shares was the good dividends. Those have now gone, at least for the short to medium term. Looking at the current state of the banks, I can&amp;#039;t see how they can get close to the 2006 prices any time in the next ten years. And of course there is always the chance that this bailout will fail and they have to be fully nationalized, making any shares worthless.                     Yes, it is one of the reasons now that large pension companies and others are dumping the big three shares as no divies&amp;#039; for the for seeable future will be paid.      I don&amp;#039;t think the bail out is going to fail, I do think  we are likely to see further banks get swallowed up along with building societies.
