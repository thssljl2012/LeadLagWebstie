     &amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;amp;nbsp;  By Rex Crum  &amp;amp;nbsp;  SAN FRANCISCO (Dow Jones) -- Wall Street sentiment continued to lean against the technology sector Tuesday after a pair of brokers cut back their earnings estimates for companies that sell computer hardware and other equipment.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  For several months, many of the leading hardware companies were thought of as being largely immune to the fallout from the credit crisis as it was mostly affecting the financial-services industry. But as time has gone on, and the crisis has worsened, more attention is being paid to how big-name computer hardware makers are tied to the financial sector and how troubles there could end up hurting the bottom lines of firms such as IBM Corp. (IBM) and Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ).  &amp;amp;nbsp;  In addition to the credit crunch, analysts say the likelihood of consumers tightening their belts and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates are also expected to have an impact on third-quarter earnings reports.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;quot;U.S. consumer PC growth has been positively correlated with disposable income growth during the past decade,&amp;quot; Richard Gardner of Citigroup wrote in a report Tuesday. &amp;quot;Disposable income will almost surely decline during the coming year, causing persistently high consumer PC unit growth rates to decelerate sharply.&amp;quot;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Gardner added that businesses are also likely to cut back spending on PCs, though investments in areas such as    virtualization    and consolidation technologies will likely remain because those are geared toward reducing the costs of electricity, real estate and personnel.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Shares of hardware makers mostly took a spill Tuesday. Sun Microsystems (JAVA) was off more than 5% while Dell (DELL) was down 4.7% by early afternoon. Apple (AAPL) and IBM were both off more than 3%. H-P shares were trading up slightly.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Big Blue sinks  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Until about two weeks ago, IBM was considered to be as solid of an investment as any company could have been in the current economic environment. Even after pulling back from its August high of $130 a share, Big Blue&amp;#039;s stock was up about 5% for the year.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  But then the failure of Lehman Brothers and the back-and-forth over the $700 billion Wall Street bailout plan began to erode some of the confidence in IBM, which draws a large portion of its revenue from the financial sector and also provides some financing for its customers -- leading to some concerns about a direct impact from the credit crunch.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  On Tuesday, Barclays Capital analyst Ben Reitzes cut his rating on IBM&amp;#039;s stock to equal weight from overweight -- one day after the stock fell below $100 for the first time since the first of the year.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;quot;Almost 30% of IBM&amp;#039;s revenue comes from the    financial   services    vertical and while about 3/4 of that amount is arguably &amp;#039;recurring,&amp;#039; checks indicate sales in this area seem to be slowing even though IBM has executed well year to date,&amp;quot; Reitzes wrote.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  The analyst left his third-quarter estimates on IBM unchanged, but lowered his forecasts for IBM&amp;#039;s fourth quarter to a profit of $2.88 a share on $29.2 billion in sales from $3.19 a share and revenue of $30.4 billion.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Reitzes also cut his rating on EMC Corp. (EMC) to equal weight from overweight, saying that while EMC executed well in the third quarter, &amp;quot;it is prudent to prepare for some abrupt [earnings and sales] deceleration.&amp;quot; Among the risks cited by Reitzes was EMC&amp;#039;s reliance on the financial services industry for about 20% of its sales, and that sales of EMC&amp;#039;s    storage   technology    products could soon follow the path of server sales and begin to slow down.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Currency impact  &amp;amp;nbsp;  At Citigroup, Gardner warned that the few areas of investment that will remain in tech are still not enough to spur overall growth in server sales, which he estimates will fall 5% in 2009.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  As such, the analyst cut his earnings estimates for the second half of 2008, and all of 2009 and 2010 on IBM, H-P, Dell and Sun.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  He also said that recent moves in the dollar against the euro and the British pound, &amp;quot;will place varying degrees of pressure on reported revenue for all    IT   hardware    companies beginning in the September quarter.&amp;quot;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Gardner said there will likely be a negative impact on European demand for hardware heading into 2009 as U.S. companies will have to raise prices in order to make up for the negative impact of a stronger dollar.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Still, Gardner said he believes the hardware market is &amp;quot;nearing a bottom,&amp;quot; and that most of the bad news for the sector has already been priced into the majority of the main computer stocks.
