 OSTK Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 2              Re: Lehman Sued Over Stock Sale To Barclays    Lehman did not sell the shares to Barclays they lent them under terms of a Global Master Securities Lending Agreement.&amp;amp;nbsp; Under the terms of that agreement title passes to the borrower.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    El-Hillow says:&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;We are outraged that a substantial number of our shares were transferred from Lehman Brothers in bankruptcy in complete disregard for Lehman Brothers&amp;#039; obligations to return the shares under its  share lending agreement  with Evergreen Solar,&amp;quot; El-Hillow said. &amp;quot;This violation of our contract with Lehman was significantly compounded by the fact that Barclays was able to acquire this valuable asset, our shares, which Lehman no longer had the power to transfer to any party other than Evergreen Solar.&amp;quot;     The 30.9 million shares in question were  loaned  to Lehman Brothers in connection with a $375 million financing Evergreen Solar completed in July 2008, Evergreen Solar added.    Following the Lehman bankruptcy, the loaned shares were not immediately returned to Evergreen Solar as required by the contract entered into with Lehman Brothers&amp;#039; European affiliate, Evergreen Solar said....   The company also noted the financing is complete and the money is in Evergreen&amp;#039;s possession. &amp;amp;nbsp;[bidrec&amp;#039;s note: they have the collateral for securities lent]        http://www.boston.com/business/ticker/2008/10/evergreen_solar_20.html     &amp;amp;nbsp;    It is a securities lending agreement:       &amp;quot;Market terminology          2.3 Notwithstanding the use of expressions such as &amp;quot;borrow&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;lend&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Collateral&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Margin&amp;quot; etc. which are used to reflect terminology used in the market for transactions of the kind provided for in this Agreement,  title to Securities  &amp;quot;borrowed&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;lent&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Collateral&amp;quot; provided in accordance with this Agreement  shall pass  from one Party to another as provided for in this Agreement, the Party obtaining such title being obliged to deliver Equivalent Securities or Equivalent Collateral as the case may be.   ...

Question: &amp;quot;Does a Lender of Securities loaned to a Borrower under the Securities Lending and Borrowing Agreement (SLA) have an equity of redemption or other equitable estate or equitable interest in those Securities or in Equivalent Securities immediately upon or after the loan of those Securities by the Lender to the Borrower?&amp;quot; ...    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Answer: &amp;quot;No&amp;quot;.      http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2008/594.html      &amp;amp;nbsp;    You see:&amp;amp;nbsp;       &amp;quot;The concept of title transfer is fundamental to securities lending and repo markets, as it is critical to the ability of the receiver of the securities to give good title to a third party to whom it may transfer those securities. This ruling will give further certainty to market participants that securities loans governed by agreements such as the Global Master Securities Lending Agreement are legally robust.&amp;quot;    http://tinyurl.com/4y3csl      &amp;amp;nbsp;    I bet you that El-Hillow thought it was like a margin agreement.       &amp;amp;nbsp;             thread start
