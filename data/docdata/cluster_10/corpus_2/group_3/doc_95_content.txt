The same thing is going on over here and it IS reported. US newspapers/news just tend to be very much restricted to US news but if you look at for instance the CNN pages there should be news about Europe available.       There are lots of takeovers going on at the moment (due to downfalls at the market) in the UK and elsewhere and some banks are (partly) nationalised, for instance Fortis Bank in the Netherlands. Rumours are going around that other giant EU banks might fall over and are too large to be safed by their governments (Like Deutsche Bank, Barclays and UBS).
