          Psychology is playing a massive role in this crisis. I have a feeling that bank assets are being severely under priced, dragging everybody into a death spiral, and that&amp;#039;s what the government is trying to stop. All they really need to do is restore confidence, and the $700 billion is what they think it will take.   What I don&amp;#039;t understand is how can you still trust the actions proposed by the same group of people who failed to prevent the crisis (there are actually some arguments that they helped to cause it) and then decided to bailout Bear Sterns debt, but not Lehman, then back in again for AIG. Why the Fed or the Treasury would be able to do a better job with public money than Barclays, Bain, and Hellman with their capital and private interest?  http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;amp;amp;um=1&amp;amp;amp;tab=wn&amp;amp;amp;no...   What we all have in the back of our mind is the Great Depression. But are we really in the same economic conditions today than in the &amp;#039;20s?
