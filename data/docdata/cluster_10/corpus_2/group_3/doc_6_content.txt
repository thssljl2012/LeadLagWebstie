 That $42 Trillion is in notional value only and will not just disappear   That is very misleading.      Most of this value in the swap market   Take a interest rate swap   You can borrow @ a lower fix rate than I can. I want a fixed rate loan for $1MM   I can borrow @ a lower floating rate than you can. You want a floating rate loan for $1MM      So we each borrow at the best rate we can get and then swap the interest rate payments (with the help of a banker for  a fee of course)      The SWAP is booked as a $1MM notional amount, however the actual cash that changes hands is maybe $70K (7% as an example, for the floating rate it might be 7.24% or 6.75%) per year.      The majority of the these swaps are for currencies, interest rates and credit default (insurance against default) (and maybe some other swap type I can not recall)made by big corporations to reduce currency and interest rate risk.   Credit default swaps could be a wild card as these are mostly held by banks and insurance companies. A failure of a big player such as AIG could put a lot of these in question   Does that mean the $ evaporates? No it means delays and legal costs to sort it all out and possibly receiving a % of the payout. The US govt will assume AIG liabilities and make good on its counter-party obligations   Delays and extra costs could result in further failures in the finance sector      While the current crisis will greatly increase the number of defaults there is no way in hell the default value will get anywhere near $42 Trillion.      The issue is no one can accurately determine how big it could get as these are all agreements between two parties with little regulation (ie no exchange or clearinghouse to act as the counter-party).       $42 Trillion?? not going to happen
