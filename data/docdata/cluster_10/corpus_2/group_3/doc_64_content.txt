 Barclays has announced a raising of private capital in an effort to stay independent.  HSBC hasn&amp;#039;t figured in this news much at all.   They are smaller than RBS, but larger than HBOS in terms of assets.   It&amp;#039;s a big step down to the rest.    So in terms of banks by assets, about half the banks are being bailed by the UK government.
