         &amp;amp;quot; plus there is no estimate of what AIG might cost,  &amp;amp;quot;  AIG is a funny case.  Most of its business is in insurance, though it does own Ocean Finance.  Its problems were mainly caused by Standard and Poors, not directly by Lehmans or Bear Sterns.  You see, it was Standard and Poors who were so ineffective at their business that they allocated an AAA rating to debt based financial instruments not on the risk represented by the paper, but on the assumed viability of the company issuing it.  Even when Bear Sterns had leveraged themselves to 65 dollars for even Dollar of income S&amp;amp;amp;P were still issuing their debt packages an AAA rating.  AIG accepted terms of insurance based on that rating. After all, to disagree with S&amp;amp;amp;P, even if their valuations were  a matter of doubt, would have been to commit professional suicide, yet within hours of Lehmans going down S&amp;amp;amp;P had downgraded AIG to A, from A++, requiring them to produce an additional $14billion in cash within 24 hours or cease trading.  When Bank of America realised that the dream of acquiring AIG&amp;#039;s assets for peanuts, it must have seemed a common sense decision to refuse to lend the money.  This because AIG&amp;#039;s profit from its other activities is in the order of $billions per month, and it has been retiring toxic debt at a rate of $5 billion a quarter!  I am waiting to see when someone gets round to suing S&amp;amp;amp;P for what must amount to contributory negligence, in a country where management can get sued by shareholders for taking decisions that lowered expected returns.  Indeed, AIG already has two generations of court cases over the very principle and someone must already be planning to sue the US government in its role as AIG owner for teh same thing.
