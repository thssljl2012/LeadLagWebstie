         This looks like they&amp;#039;re taking one heck of a big gamble...   &amp;amp;quot;Given the strength of Barclays well diversified business and the existing capital base, the Board expects that the additional capital will be raised from investors without calling on the Government funding which has been offered to UK Banks&amp;amp;quot;   Sounds great, however...   &amp;amp;quot;In the event that any of the proposed capital issuances do not proceed, Barclays, along with the other UK banks, would be eligible to have access to the capital facilities announced by the UK Government on 8 October 2008. The terms of such facilities would be negotiated at the time and may be on terms less favourable than those made available today.&amp;amp;quot;   If they pull it off, this will be fantastic. No major government interference! On the other hand, if they don&amp;#039;t, this could become another RBS!   - venice2001.
