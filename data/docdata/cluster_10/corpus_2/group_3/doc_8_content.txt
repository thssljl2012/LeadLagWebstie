I agree - although I don&amp;#039;t know exactly what Greenspan meant by &amp;#039;Investors&amp;#039;, I also would say it&amp;#039;s the investors that bought subprime packages and couldn&amp;#039;t get enough of them (primarily Investment Banks)- no matter who received those mortgages and didn&amp;#039;t care if they will ever be paid off!          Plato,        I know a little about this industry, the key players and the instruments. I have been out for about 3 years and so I was not part of this.        A couple of things for you and others to consider:        1. IF the investors could not buy insuarnce for these products, they would never have bought it, without any downside protection. Not in hundreds of Billions or Trillions of $ anyway.        The problem is Congress deregulated BOTH the industry that packaged these mortage products (collateralized debt obligations), AND the guys providing the insurance (AIG, for e.g.). So, if the insurance players had been forced to have sufficient capital for the insurance they were providing, and had this insurance contract been regulted, like the others, then there would have been a backstop, with the capital to absorb the losses on the balance sheet of the insurers.        2. The mortgage originators looked the other way when the mortgage brokers made up a vast majority of the numbers on the credit forms for the mortgages, by working with the applicant to inflate assets and income, working with the real estate appraisers to inflate market values, particularly in areas with fast increasing prices, and the investors took these sub-prime and Alt A mortgages with adjustable rates, that would set much higher SOON,  ONLY  because they could buy insurance. If the investors did not buy, the originators would not have been able to sell this high risk stuff and the originators (Countrywide and the large banks), would have been stuck with it on their balance sheets. Knowing what they knew about the mortgage brokers, these guys would never have continued to writing these crappy mortages, if they could not securitize them. So, the investors were the KEY. And for the Investors, the insurance and the credit ratings (which the rating agencies I think did not quite understand at best, or ignored it incomeptently), was what made it work. In the end, the deck of cards crumbled in such a huge way because the insurance was simply not there. Why? Because AIG wrote most of this without the Capital. WHY? Because it was unregulated.        The investors ASSUMED AIG was SO BIG that the insurance had NO risk, because of AIG&amp;#039;s huge balance sheet and their credit AAA credit ratings!        THIS IS KEY TO UNDERSTAND.        This would have happened, even if Greespan had not had huge money supply and low rates, AND will happen again UNLESS the mortagage brokerage and CDO insurance industry (Credit default swaps) are BOTH regulated.        My 2 cents worth.
