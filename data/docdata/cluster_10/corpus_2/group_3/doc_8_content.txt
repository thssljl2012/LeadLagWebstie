not sure. i wouldnt seriously expect any company in their right mind to &amp;amp;quot;colleralize&amp;amp;quot; their entire asset base, especially AIG considering their risk controls to insurance and enormous asset base (they own over 1/3 of all commercial planes in america). even bear sterns, quite possibly the most leveraged of any firm during the crisis, never came close to such leverage. the issue here is financing day to day operations with overnight loans.
