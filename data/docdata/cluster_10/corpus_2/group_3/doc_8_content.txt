         According to this article RBS is now the cheapest FTSE100 company on the measure its stock market value is just 12pc of its book value.  Barclays rate 49% and LloydsTSB 86%.   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/ftse100/3285663/O...   Warren Buffett gets a mention but somehow I don&amp;#039;t see him buying into RBS, but what a story if he did.   &amp;amp;quot;Value investors like Warren Buffett have gone on the record to say that the market is now incredibly cheap by historic standards. It takes a brave individual to bet against him,&amp;amp;quot;
