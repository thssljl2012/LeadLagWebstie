           Quoting  LJ  ( Reply 53 ):   this does not mean that ILFC has automatically the same problems as AIG.       No, not the exact same problems.   But the WSJ had an article on this (sorry, I read the paper version, I think it was last week).  Financing is tough right now.  Its a mater of substantiating who can get financing.   Its an old Fed quote &amp;#039;you cannot force banks to lend.&amp;#039;    Credit right now is painfully tight.  Bloomberg and the WSJ are reporting daily that banks do not want to lend the billions.  Its easier to get a jumbo mortgage in California than borrow against a ship, airplane, or other large ticket item.  (BoA and Wells fargo both charge 9%+ and are demanding huge down payments for California jumbo mortgages... hmmm...)      Not to mention ILFC still has the AIG insurance co-deal on their web page.  &amp;amp;nbsp;       Lightsaber
