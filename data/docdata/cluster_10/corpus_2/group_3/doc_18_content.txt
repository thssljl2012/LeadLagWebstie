          RBS STILLA PPEARS OUT OF FAVOUR WITH THE MARKET. SHARES DOWN SLIGHTLY ONCE MORE THIS MORNING WITH BARCLAYS FORGING AHEAD.  IS THERE SOMETHING THE MARKET KNOWS ABOUT RBS THAT THE AVERAGE RBS PUNTER DOESN&amp;#039;T?  THERE IS A SUSPICION IN MY MIND THAT RBS IS NEXT ON THE LIST OF THE SPIVS AND THE LIKE TO MAKE IT FAIL - AFTER ALL THEY SEEM TO STILL CONTROL THE MARKET DESPITE THE BAN ON SHORT SELLING. OR MAYBE THOSE OF US WHO PUT OUR HARD EARNED SAVINGS INTO THE RIGHTS ISSUE IN AN ATTEMPT TO SUPPORT THE BANK AND STOP DILUTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS WERE JUST MISLEAD/ GULLABLE AGAIN!  I READ SOMEWHERE THAT ONE MARKET ANALYST ESTIMATES THAT RBS NEEDS ANOTHER 14BN TO SEE IT THROUGH AND BARCLAYS ABOUT 12BN. THE INDICATION FROM THIS IS THAT THE STATE OF THESE BANKS IS DIRE. BARCLAYS HAS JUST CHERRY PICKED ASSETS FROM THE GOLDMAN DISASTER,TAKEN A MORE RELAXED VIEW ON WRITE-DOWNS THAN RBS (AS USUAL) AND ITS SHARE PRICE IS IMPROVING WHEREAS RBS HAS KEPT ITS HEAD DOWN OF LATE AND MADE &amp;#039;AGGRESSIVE&amp;#039; WRITE DOWNS AND IT&amp;#039;S SHARE PRICE IS FALLING.  ANY IDEAS?    Focus your eyes on the letter &amp;#039;A&amp;#039; on your keyboard.  Now, move your gaze a little to the left - just a bit.  That&amp;#039;s it! You&amp;#039;ve got it!   comp.    p.s.   I READ SOMEWHERE THAT ONE MARKET ANALYST ESTIMATES THAT RBS NEEDS ANOTHER 14BN TO SEE IT THROUGH AND BARCLAYS ABOUT 12BN.    Really? I know that guy, writes somewhere doesn&amp;#039;t he? And works for some company? We have the same person in mind, right?   comp.
