My worry is that we are very close to a melt-down due to the actions of the credit markets and the amount of debt exposure that American families now have.  I&amp;#039;m not a fan of the bailout, believe me, but I am really worried that the depth of our collective exposure and the consequences could turn out to be horrific.        I would have preferred a &amp;amp;quot;bottom-up&amp;amp;quot; bailout plan to be perfectly candid.  I would have preferred supporting the homeowners, reducing the risk of mortgage failures and bankruptcy due to household indebtedness.  But I also think that there wasn&amp;#039;t time to do that.        Regardless, your positions on this issue are closer to mine - but I think the carnage that doing nothing would have been a lot worse - and punish all the wrong people in its wake.        Best regards,        Joe             Joe, Paul, Nick:        Immediately after Bailout legislation was passed, Paul Krugman (NYT) wrote that he expects a Bailout Version 2.0 to be submitted in early January when new Congress convenes but Bush administration is still around for another 2 weeks. To me, it means that problems are far more severe and unpredictable than we are led to believe.    Then one has to take unpredictable impact of Globalization. Currently European banks are heavily affected by US credit disease; even Hong Kong and China are affected (and some of the HK banks are heavily owned by banks in UK). Lehman/WaMu bankruptcy are still reverbrating all over Europe, Hong Kong and US. How will US banks be affected if some European banks hit the skids?        Does anybody understand the exact problem? I doubt it. People talk in generalities, like banks are not lending each other. What does that mean? Citi not lending to JP Morgan or Fidelity Investments not lending to Vanguard / GE Capital or hedge funds? Nobody has any idea. I understand Credit Default Swaps are coming in October for defaulted securities of WaMu, Lehman and hedge funds and others. How much, who knows. Who is impacted, who knows? Are other major insurance companies, beside AIG, on the hook and can they meet their obligations? I don&amp;#039;t know. There is rumour that KING COUNTY (SEATTLE) HAS LOST $200 MILLION, probably in WaMu securities. How many other city and state institutions and pension funds are involved? Damage is unravelling but only slowly and slowly. And local taxpayers are likely to be hit hard.        What is a credit market? It is another nebulous term used very loosely. What are Money market mutual funds doing with their money if they refuse to roll over commercial paper? Are they just sitting on cash earning no interest? I doubt it.  And Money market funds are over $2 Trillion. Everybody cannot buy US Government paper; there are just not enough of them around for everybody to own it.        There is too much fear of unknowns. Under those conditions, everybody acts rationally in their own interest (even though the action may turn out to be an irrational act). Under those circumstances, even I will act (ir)rationally.        Here is a snippit from to-days WSJ regarding Dubai (Middle East):         Analysts have grown increasingly pessimistic about whether Dubai&amp;#039;s market will weather a flood of new supply. Regional bank EFG-Hermes, in a report late last month ,  estimated Dubai residential property prices increased more than 14% year-to-date. But the bank said it expects prices to peak in the first half of next year before falling by as much as 20% by 2011, echoing recent pessimism by other property analysts         How much effect Middle East will have on US and other European &amp;amp;amp; Japanese and even Middle Eastern banks, especially in the light of falling oil prices, is anybody&amp;#039;s guess? .        There are very interesting (and probably quite dangerous) times ahead. Keep your seat belts fastened very tightly, folks.          Welcome to the Wild and Wonderful world of Globalization.
