          RBS needs to raise about 10 billion to increase its Tier 1 capital, or so we are told. Apparently Preference shares do not count towards Tier 1 capital, so it will have to be another rights issue, this time underwritten by the Government.   I&amp;#039;m not an expert but from what I&amp;#039;ve read it looks like Prefs don&amp;#039;t count towards Core Tier 1 but they do towards Tier 1. It would seem to be this distinction that will be crucial in determing which method they go down. If the Government set a minimum threshold for Tier 1 (as it appears they were intending in the statement last week) then Prefs are possible as they indicated. However, if they&amp;#039;ve moved the goalposts and are now requiring a minimum for Core Tier 1 then this shortfall needs to be fixed by issuing ordinary shares.  I&amp;#039;m not sure how the Government could underwrite an issue of Ords without opening themselves up to significant risks and clearly back-tracking on their statement last week. They&amp;#039;ve supposedly been working on the plan for weeks so it should be accurate one released. For this reason I continue to believe that the minimum threshold will be on Tier 1 and hence Prefs will be a possibility.  Conseqently, of all the press I&amp;#039;ve read the piece in the Independent looks closest to the truth but nothing would surprise me any more and with the Times and Telegraph reporting the same thing (namely a redrawing of the plan to require a minimum Core Tier 1 and hence the necessity of an underwritten Rights Issue of Ords with all the extra associated risk for the tax payer), I&amp;#039;d be foolish to bet against it being true.    One thing I can&amp;#039;t get my head around is where is Barclays finding the cash from. Their Tier 1 is the same as RBS (although their Core Tier 1 is better), they haven&amp;#039;t written their numbers down to the same extent and they&amp;#039;ve just bought Lehmans. Now if the threshold is on Core Tier 1 then RBS will have to raise more than BARC but if it&amp;#039;s on Tier 1 then I don&amp;#039;t see RBS as being anywhere near as bad as is being reflected in the press.  So from an existing shareholder&amp;#039;s perspective it really does hinge on whether it is Core Tier 1 or Tier 1 that needs to be improved.   IMO, DYOR etc
