From the June 6th Financial Sense Editorials (see  http://www.financialsense.com/editor...08/0606.html):            Quote:                         While attention has been focused on the relatively tiny US sub-prime home mortgage default crisis as the center of the current financial and credit crisis impacting the Anglo-Saxon banking world, a far larger problem is now coming into focus. Sub-prime or high-risk Collateralized Mortgage Obligations, CMOs as they are called, are only the tip of a colossal iceberg of dodgy credits which are beginning to go sour. The next crisis is already beginning in the $62 TRILLION market for Credit Default Swaps. You never heard of them? Its time to take a look, then.       ...      A chain reaction of failures in the CDS market could trigger the next global financial crisis. The market is entirely unregulated, and there are no public records showing whether sellers have the assets to pay out if a bond defaults. This so-called counterparty risk is a ticking time bomb. The US Federal Reserve under the ultra-permissive chairman, Alan Greenspan and the US Governments financial regulators allowed the CDS market to develop entirely without any supervision. Greenspan repeatedly testified to skeptical Congressmen that banks are better risk regulators than government bureaucrats.                     wrong and wrong again Mr. Greenspan.      And guess why AIG - an  Insurance  company - was one of the biggest losers in the current crisis.  Because the CDS market is an  Insurance  market that is unregulated and helped obscure the risks of subprime loans.  Before Republican-lead deregulation, there were numerous safeguards against the current crisis - not that some companies (even big ones) wouldn&amp;#039;t have failed, just that the failures would have been isolated.
