         OK, so why is GE willing to pay 10% for money from Berkshire?  I think everyone is wondering. But what if GE needed a bundle of cash quick and they didn&amp;#039;t want to have to explain the reasons in a public forum?  Say, for instance, they had an opportunity to buy a significant business at a discount and they didn&amp;#039;t want to open it up for possible competitors. OK, hold that thought. Following the news recently, AIG has announced that they plan to sell off some of their non-insurance businesses to shore up their capital position.  AIG is one of the biggest commercial plane leasors to the airlines.  So is GE. Could GE have the opportunity to buy that business from AIG for a significant discount, there by making them the pre-eminent provider of commercial planes to the airlines?  And could GE use that position to encourage the airlines to require the manufacturers to put GE engines on the planes? Just food for thought.
