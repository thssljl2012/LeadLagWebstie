          &amp;amp;quot;&amp;#039;Contrary to press rumours, Barclays has not requested capital from the government and has no reason to do so.&amp;#039;  As the re-capitalisation is apparently at the behest of HMG I would be very surprised if it were at a 50% discount to the present SP.  Lots of things surprise me these days though. &amp;amp;quot;   Except according to the announcement, the rescue plan was only agreed because (amongst other things) the banks agreed to raise their capital by 25bn.  That&amp;#039;s not achieve a specific target; that&amp;#039;s  raise  their capital (in aggregate) by 25bn from where they are  now .  Admittedly they haven&amp;#039;t agreed who needs to raise by what amount, but according to ITN last night, the government were clear that there was to be no stigma attached to those using the scheme... and the way they were achieving that was by ensuring that all the big banks were involved... including Barc and HSBC.  That said, if they could raise capital without needing the government capital injection, then would be a big plus on two fronts... it&amp;#039;d mean no dilution and the banks remaining in control, and secondly, it would demonstrate that they are actually reasonably strong!   - venice2001.
