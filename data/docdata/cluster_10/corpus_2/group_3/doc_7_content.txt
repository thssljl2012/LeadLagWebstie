 &amp;quot;Citi&amp;amp;#8217;s Tony Wible has come out with his own report today, and joins Barclays in seeing upside potential in Sirius XM Radio.&amp;quot;  Why doesn&amp;#039;t he &amp;quot;join Barclays&amp;quot; and match their pot?  At least he&amp;#039;s not talking about a SIRI / iPhone this time.  Sorry, Citi, Apple&amp;#039;s iPhone Won&amp;#039;t Save Sirius XM
