         Forcast sharp falls in commodities When exactly did you write this speech, Nouriel?!    Commodities. The big boys are still busy liquidating long positions in commodities. As the price of everything from oil to tin has tumbled, hedge funds and other investors, such as pension funds, have found themselves with big losses and have been liquidating positions in the commodities themselves and in commodity stocks.   Some of these positions aren&amp;#039;t very old. CalPERS, a huge California public-employees pension fund, announced in February that it was going to increase its exposure to commodities over the next two years. The fund lost just 5.1% in the fiscal year that ended in June 2008 and then reported losing $48 billion more, about 20% of assets, from the end of June through Oct. 10.   That big loss corresponds pretty well to the period when commodity prices went through the floor. About 450 commodity hedge funds held $80 billion in assets as of Sept. 23, up 14% from the end of March, according to Barclays Capital. Investments in commodity indexes reached a record $175 billion at the end of June.   Long positions have been unwinding lately even faster than they were built up, however. Net long positions on the commodity futures markets in New York and Chicago fell to just 7% of total open futures contracts Sept. 23, from 14% on March 25, Barclays Capital reported.    http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/JubaksJournal...
