         I have also been wondering why RBS seems to be regarded more negatively recently by the market than the other banks.  I don&amp;#039;t buy that English-Scottish thing and am wondering if there is some other fundamental reason(s).  Could it be continuing anxiety about the Amro acquisition?  The trouble that engulfed Fortis on Monday hasn&amp;#039;t helped here, focussing minds somewhat.  Didn&amp;#039;t someone in Fortis admit the Amro deal was done at the wrong time at the wrong price?  There is the continuing worry about writedowns and whether a further fund-raising will be required.  RBS was one of the more &amp;#039;agressive&amp;#039; growth banks prior to the crisis and it seems this makes them more risky now.  Again, possibly vague writedowns from Amro aren&amp;#039;t helping sentiment.  RBS haven&amp;#039;t made much headway in asset disposal save the train deal.  AFAIK they still have Direct Line.  Goodwin said he wouldn&amp;#039;t be a forced seller.  So is this good or bad news?  Good that their capital position is OK and they don&amp;#039;t have to sell or bad that they want to sell but can&amp;#039;t find a buyer.  Maybe it&amp;#039;s just down to the greater uncertainty surrounding RBS compared to the others.  HSBC has its rock solid balance sheet and excellent savings/loan ratio; the market seems to like Barclays cherry picking the best of Lehmans and of course they avoided the Amro purchase which has probably earned them some brownie points; Similarly Lloyds is recovering as investors seem to be appreciating the bargain it has secured with HBOS, albeit with some risk attached.
