Lehman is still here, as Barclays.                       Wrong.  Only the Broker-Dealer part of Lehman is at Barclays.  This is a typical mistake made by people who are not in the Financial Industry.  The most expensive part, the Investment Management Division, was bought out by two Private Equities, Bain in Boston and F &amp;amp;amp; H in San Francisco.  The Japanese (Nomura) also bought a portion.  And portions of it (such as the bulk of Investment Management in London) are now lost forever, the employees fired and the offices closed.  Lehman Brothers is gone.  It has been dismembered.              Quote:                         Merrill is still here, and if it merged, it would strengthen, not weaken NYC (though it&amp;#039;s questionable now it will merge).                      Again wrong.  There is dread right now in BoA AND Merrill, because it is a given that there will be massive layoffs in the weeks ahead.  Too much redundancy, and BoA is only interested in the cream of Merrill&amp;#039;s business (the brokerage division).  A lot of the layoffs will be in NYC.  The fact that the job market in NYC is already saturated with Financial Industry applicants is making people nervous...       Remember that Merrill once employed more than 50 000 people worldwide (compared to Lehman&amp;#039;s 25 000), with the bulk of operations in NYC.  The necessary layoffs in Merrill alone will drastically impact the job market in NYC.           Quote:                         Bear Stearns was bought my JPMorgan, another NY bank.      Goldman and Morgan Stanley are doing fine, as always.      And of course you forgot to mention...      The fourth largest U.S. Bank, Wachovia, is now part of NY&amp;#039;s Citibank.      The sixth largest U.S. Bank, WaMu, is now part of NY&amp;#039;s JPMorgan Chase.      The last few weeks have actually centralized finance moreso than in many decades.                     Remember that all of what you say here are shotgun weddings.  They were pretty much mandated to them.  They pretty much will translate/have translated into layoffs.  And notice that technically, there are NO MORE traditional Investment Banks left in the world except the Japanese titan Nomura Holdings Inc.  Goldman and Morgan Stanley have pretty much agreed to greater regulation, ending their existence as traditional Investment Banks:       http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/20...Stanley&amp;amp;amp;st=cse       Even in traditional Banking, BoA has outstripped Citi and is now the Largest commercial bank in the US and the second largest in the world.  It is a telling sign of the times that with the sale of Merrill, BoA is also now the largest brokerage in the world -- the first time a company outside of NYC has done this.        In short, my original claim is correct:  NYC is no longer the Investment Banking Capital of the World, and -- sad to say -- London is now de facto the reigning Financial Capital of the World.         This does not mean that things are not going to change.  It largely depends on how the US is going to address the current financial crisis, and how much consolidation and regulation the financial institutions can bear.  The fate of the financial industry in the US is intrinsically linked to the fate of many of the financial institutions in NYC, and as I said before, the current financial crisis is pretty much NYC&amp;#039;s as much as it is the entire country&amp;#039;s.
