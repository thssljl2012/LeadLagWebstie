RL    This just in...from our permabear friend Roubini...    Roubini Says Forecast of Market Shutdown Coming True (Update2)  By Ben Sills and Emma Ross-Thomas    Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- New York University Professor Nouriel Roubini  said curbs placed on U.S. futures trading today shows his prediction  that markets will be shut down amid panic selling is coming true.    ``This morning, even before the markets in the U.S. opened, the S&amp;amp;amp;P  futures fell by more than their daily limit,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; resulting in curbs on  futures trading, Roubini told a conference in Madrid today. ``What I  said yesterday has already started.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;    Roubini said yesterday that policy makers may need to shut down  financial markets for a week or two as investors dump assets. Trading  in futures on the Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s 500 Index and the Dow Jones  Industrial Average was limited today after declines of more than 6  percent. Trading of U.S. stocks would be suspended for an hour should  the Dow Jones Industrial Average decline 1,100 points to 7,591.25.    ``Things are getting worse, they are not getting better,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Roubini  said. There&amp;#039;s an increased risk of a ``multi-year economic  stagnation&amp;#039;&amp;#039; in the U.S. and ``we have a whole set of emerging market  economies in trouble. Even a few of them going bust may cause systemic  trouble.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;    Russia&amp;#039;s RTS exchange today stopped trading after stocks slumped more  than 10 percent. Europe&amp;#039;s Dow Jones Stoxx 600 Index slid 8.5 percent.  The MSCI World index of global stocks has lost 45 percent this year as  the fallout from the U.S. housing crisis toppled banks from Seattle to  Paris.    Great Depression    Still, Roubini said he doesn&amp;#039;t expect the economic consequences of the  current crisis to be as severe as the Great Depression. ``During the  Great Depression, output in the U.S. fell by more than 20 percent, I  don&amp;#039;t believe that&amp;#039;s going to be the case,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.    In July 2006, Roubini predicted the financial crisis. In February this  year he forecast a ``catastrophic&amp;#039;&amp;#039; meltdown that central bankers  would fail to prevent, leading to the bankruptcy of large banks  exposed to mortgages and a ``sharp drop&amp;#039;&amp;#039; in equities.    Roubini said that the European Central Bank should provide ``much more  monetary easing&amp;#039;&amp;#039; and governments around the world must put together a  massive fiscal stimulus package after action so far failed to halt the  stock-market rout. The U.S. bank bail- out plan will likely require  between $600 billion and $700 billion, he said.    Roubini, a former senior adviser to the U.S. Treasury Department, said  earlier this month that the world&amp;#039;s biggest economy will suffer its  worst recession in 40 years.
