          I recently ( before the crunch started ) investedmost of my retirement monies in Barclays Bank in what they call &amp;amp;quot; Barclays Dynamic funds &amp;amp;quot;. In the light of the current crisis is this a risky place to have my money and should i withdraw now or is it still a good investment??    I am not quite sure what &amp;amp;quot;Barclays Dynamic Funds&amp;amp;quot; might consist of, but I would say do not compound the error of buying high (with the benefit of hindsight) by selling low as well.  You need to carefully assess the funds, and their propspects for (long-term regrettably) recovery.  Rgds  diver
