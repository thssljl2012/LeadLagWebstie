          If I stopped contributing to my 401k, I would be saving that money in a traditional savings account and/or paying down debt.  Thoughts?     Good stocks, and the funds which hold them, WILL come back eventually.  Savings accounts pay diddly and what you do get is taxable.  Now, if you&amp;#039;re ten years or less to retirement, I&amp;#039;d start moving funds to bonds or CD&amp;#039;s.  I&amp;#039;ve been recommending SPDR Barclays Capital TIPS ETF (AMEX:IPE).  But even that&amp;#039;s been down.  Take a look once things start turning around.
