          Every year the Barclays Equity/gilt study highlights the fact that money invested in shares offers by far the greatest returns over the long term. That same study, also every year, highlights the fact that it is the reinvested dividends, compounded year on year, that account for turning good returns into huge returns.   This twaddle gets trotted out so regularly everyone seems to take it as gospel.  It was dealt with in what may be the best post ever to appear on any of these boards, Mr Contrarians 7453 on this very board... which says:   100 invested in equities in 1945 would now be worth 7000 if you did not reinvest the dividends. With dividends reinvested you would have 95000.  This startling result is commonly believed by journalists to prove that the yield is far more important than rate of capital growth and that therefore high yield is indipensible.  In the example capital growth is 7.6%, yield 4.95%.  But what if we reversed the calculation?  100 invested at 4.95% yield for 58 years gives 1648. Add 7.6% PA capital growth and we get 95000. Which is more important now?     HT
