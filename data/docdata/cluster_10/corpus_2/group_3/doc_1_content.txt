                          What is the actual status of Lehman ?  I know they filed and that Barclays will purchase the U.S. part and other firms other parts.   But these transactions never seem to end given all the subsidiaries, legal disputes, firms backing out of purchases, bankruptcy filings with soundings that they might be able to save &amp;quot;somethings&amp;quot;, judges rulings, shareholders suits, regulators approval, etc..    Is the body dead and buried with no chance of revival ?  Barclays and other firms purchases definite with no backing out ?  Any existing Lehman employees just  wrapping up business [accountants, lawyers, etc. which took Andersen and Enron years and may still not be done !] ?  all traders, quants, etc. out the door and working for other firms or looking for other jobs ? =========================================    On a similar issue, about Merrill Lynch Wikipedia says &amp;quot;Plans were announced on September 14, 2008 for Bank of America to acquire Merrill Lynch, if approved by regulators and shareholders of both companies[1]. The plan was approved and Merrill Lynch sold for $29 per share ($50 billion dollars) [2].&amp;quot;    Does this [or other info.] mean that the deal is set in stone, both ML and BofA obtained whatever regulator, stock/bond holders, others approval that is needed and that all is left is ML transitioning out of their business and into BofA ? I know reports say &amp;quot;expected to close in 1Q 2009&amp;quot; and that ML employees and offices are &amp;quot;pretty much&amp;quot; operating as normal, but will ML and BofA want/be able to start moving employees or business into BofA before 1Q 2009 ?  It seemed Chase started moving Bear people in before all the paper work was done but ML is different. ==========     Given all the subsidiaries of firms, lawyers, accountants, regulators, etc.  it never seems possible to know what happening unless you are able to walk past the building and see the chains on the door and police signs directing to the new firm.
