       &amp;amp;quot;...For consideration, AIG, whose $85 billion dollar bailout is in addition to the $700 billion figure being crafted in Washington, has what some would might call a less than stellar record in some of its past corporate dealings.  For example, according to Austin based non profit organization Texans for Public Justice, after the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington, AIG&amp;#039;s former chair and CEO, Maurice &amp;amp;quot;Hank&amp;amp;quot; Greenberg, led &amp;amp;quot;a lobbying blitz to get taxpayers to bail out terrorism-related insurance losses.  TPJ also reported in a series called Bush donor profiles, that AIG had helped the now infamous Enron Corporation &amp;amp;quot;cook its books&amp;amp;quot; by investing in its LJM2 partnership along with Merril Lynch.  In 2003, AIG paid $10 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission fraud charges that it helped a struggling mobile phone company pad its earnings by selling it a phony, back-dated insurance policy. Further still, AIG paid $126 million in 2004 to settle criminal and civil charges that it similarly helped PNC Financial Services hid $762 million in poorly performing loans in 2001.  According to TPJ, former AIG CEO Greenberg, while sitting on the New York Stock Exchange , helped approve what became a publicly condemned $187 million retirement package leading to the ouster of NYSE Chairman Dick Grasso.  TPJ goes on to say that &amp;amp;quot;around that time, Greenberg got Grasso to pressure NYSE buyers to prop up AIG&amp;#039;s stock price.  And while such alleged mischief leaves a bad taste in the mouths of countless taxpayers, experts caution that AIG&amp;#039;s assets must go someplace and the bailout of AIG and others is probably necessary.  &amp;amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s entirely legitimate for people to ask questions about why we&amp;#039;re doing this and who benefits as long as this isn&amp;#039;t used as an excuse to delay action,&amp;amp;quot; said New York University&amp;#039;s David Backus.  &amp;amp;quot;To the extent we might want to blame somone, there&amp;#039;s more than enough evidence of bad judgement by both parties with Fannie and Freddie being the most obvious examples,&amp;amp;quot; he said.  But, there are some holdouts.  As Ari J. Officer and Lawrence J. Officer opined on September 29 in TIME Magazine, &amp;#039;the $700 billion (ultimately $1 trillion or more) bailout is not predominantly for mortgages and homeowners.  The Officers say the bailout is for mortgage-backed securities. In fact, some versions of these instruments are imaginary derivatives. These claims overlap on the same types of mortgages.  The Time article said that many financial institutions wrote claims over the same mortgages, and these are the majority of claims that have &amp;amp;quot;gone bad.&amp;amp;quot;  One solution that might provide some level of palatability to taxpayers who others who view the bailout as extreme is an &amp;amp;quot;institutional risk insurance premium.&amp;amp;quot;  The idea was touted in a September 17, &amp;amp;quot;New York Times&amp;amp;quot; Op-Ed by Jonathan G S Koppell, Director of the Millstein Center for Corporate Governance and Performance at Yale.  Koppell asked &amp;amp;quot;why not make investment banks and other companies pay premiums for this catastrophic insurance.&amp;amp;quot;  He argues further that the &amp;amp;quot;goal should be to limit the contagion of failure rather than prevent the failure itself.&amp;amp;quot;  Later, in an email message, Professor Koppell wrote that the idea of &amp;#039;failure tax&amp;#039; &amp;amp;quot;could be used to emphasize that the public should not be providing insurance to these companies gratis.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;amp;quot;The American people don&amp;#039;t get the profits so why should they be stuck with the losses,&amp;amp;quot; he said.  Such input from experts and others has only fueled the ongoing informal conversations, questions and nighttime arguments over who, what and how this will all play out in the end for those beyond the busy trading floors in the financial district and the halls of Government in Washington.  &amp;amp;quot;In a nutshell, we are an over-inflated economy that has placed to much trust in synthetic trades,&amp;amp;quot; according to one New York stock analyst who asked to remain anonymous while sipping drinks with a friend who works for a major New York City bank.  The anonymous analyst said that Wall Street is all about leverage, going on to charge that leverage is like odds, you bet one, but if you lose, you lose a thousand.  During that same conversation at a downtown bar, the analyst said that Wall Streets assets are based on synthetic value, mere blips on a screen than actual assets.  Whatever that means, it seems clear, that Wall Street has been and will continue to capitalize off of every day American&amp;#039;s debt, and that debt, has allowed Americans to operate, often beyond their means.  Still, as the anylist in New York pointed out, ordinary Americans don&amp;#039;t really have a say here.  &amp;amp;quot;Whether you think it&amp;#039;s good, bad or you&amp;#039;re indifferent, you have no control,&amp;amp;quot; he said to his banker friend.  He went on to say that taxpayers will be rolling the dice with the $700 billion dollar bailout. First, there is no way of knowing whether or not the market will buy back the distressed debt at any point in the future and whether or not, this will put the country back on the path to greater growth.  According to an August 2008 report from the Office of Macroeconomic Analysis, the United States economy has &amp;amp;quot;remained on a path of slower growth since late 2007.  To this, many Americans are asking whether or not this plan that allegedly provides a shot in the arm of the market abyss will impact their own income streams.  &amp;amp;quot;There is absolutely no guarantee this $700 billion will do anything to stave off a catastrophe in the longterm,&amp;amp;quot; the anonymous analyst said wearily over a Grey Goose martini with olives. http://www.politicalcortex.com/story/2008/10/2/162210/562
