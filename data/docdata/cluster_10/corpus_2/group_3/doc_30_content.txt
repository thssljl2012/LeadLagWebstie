Paul Krugman won the Nobel Prize for Economics today. Normally, that would make for a pretty good day.    But Krugman won an even(*)bigger victory today when Henry Paulson edged away from throwing away vast amounts of taxpayer dollars on toxic mortgage-backed assets, and edged towards buying an equity stake in the nation&amp;#039;s largest banks.    Paulson appears to be following the lead of  British P.M. Gordon Brown , who is buying(*)60% of Royal Bank of Scotland, along with 40% of HBOS and Lloyds TSB, which will merge under pressure from Brown.    Krugman takes a victory lap in his  NY Times column :    This sort of temporary part-nationalization, which is often referred to as an equity injection, is the crisis solution advocated by many economists  and sources told The Times that it was also the solution privately favored by Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman.      But when Henry Paulson, the U.S. Treasury secretary, announced his plan for a $700 billion financial bailout, he rejected this obvious path, saying, Thats what you do when you have failure. Instead, he called for government purchases of toxic mortgage-backed securities, based on the theory that ... actually, it never was clear what his theory was.     &amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt; Unfortunately it&amp;#039;s also not clear whether Paulson will really(*)save our banks(*)or bankrupt our(*)Treasury.(*)Until he actually buys bank equity, we won&amp;#039;t know whether he&amp;#039;s getting taxpayers a Brown Deal, a Buffet Deal, or a classic Bush-Cheney Raw Deal.    For those keeping score at home, it&amp;#039;s now Krugman 2, Paulson 0. And the next time Obama is asked to name his Treasury Secretary, Krugman would be the best answer.         (Source Link)
