 I don&amp;#039;t entirely believe in EMH. Seems to me sometimes people overreact on the upside or the downside.        Thinking financials one of these cases, started buying nearly a year ago. Including companies such as Citi, Barclays, Deutschebank, Countrywide, Wachovia, Wamu, and (later) Lehman.          Luckily, never put more than about 2% of portfolio in any one position, or more than 20% of portfolio into the financials overweight. But increased positions as they fell, magnifying losses.        Rough guess, total portfolio is about 10% smaller than it would have been had I not gone into financials. Maybe worse.            Thought I&amp;#039;d share, to balance a couple posts about buying international&amp;amp;amp;domestic small value instead of tech stocks back in dotcom bubble days.        I still like my remaining financials (though wary of buying more on dips with the ban on shorting), Japan small and large, and VWO (EM) which I just bought more of.
