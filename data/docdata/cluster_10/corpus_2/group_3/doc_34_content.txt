 I think a while ago we were talking also about the dollar and I posted I thought it would be raising, not because the US economy was doing better, but europe was crashing.   Well, today we see some of the cracks.   The major european banks are far more more leveraged than the already failed US investment banks ever were.   Europe has already decided that as a community they can&amp;#039;t decide anything as a community, so they just issued a general pep talk instead.   Barclays and Deutsche Bank are the two most over leveraged banks in the world right now, time to see them crash as well.
