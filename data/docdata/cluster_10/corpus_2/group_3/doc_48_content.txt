       Hi TJ,  It&amp;#039;s great to be back penning my thoughts on this thread....and to get a welcome note back from your goodself.  For over 2 years, I kept it a habit to be a disciplinedly, silent reader of the valuable contributions you and your cohorts make here, in all sort of directions. I could just not make any valuable ones, as I&amp;#039;ve just been mostly confused about the world&amp;#039;s financial goings on.  But last weekend, sitting quietly at my desk in KL, I came across the Bloomberg piece that covered Dr. Tony Tan&amp;#039;s interview about the Singapore GIC and his comments about waiting to pick up equities, etc at rock bottom prices. I also received on the previous Friday (Oct 3rd) an extensive set of some 100+ research reports from Barclays Capital, yes, ex-Lehman analysts (I&amp;#039;m not even their client!!) in a single day, and when I went through some of their research on my old favourite stocks at Nasdaq and NYSE, esp. their price targets, I was awestruck by how they were brazen enough to assign targets some 50-100% above their then respective current prices. That prompted my thinking to say, perhaps the Singaporeans could be getting it, and should I not, so to speak, &amp;#039;poke&amp;#039; TJ a little to see his reaction to their thinking.  Well, a week later, with prices another 20% cheaper, I hear you say to RS that you&amp;#039;re buying. So, have you joined the optimist crowd, and if so, pray confirm to us, what sectors and which markets are you buying, or would consider buying.....and is it time to think of dumping or reducing gold holdings, esp coins....since some of the mining stock names were also in Lehman analyst&amp;#039;s (sorry Barclays Capital)?  Many thanks for all your oftentimes confusing/confounding thoughts (for simpletons like me), and for all the hard work I&amp;#039;ve put in reading your postings, and in-tray outputs, I&amp;#039;ve not made any money &amp;#039;out of you&amp;#039; yet....how&amp;#039;s that for &amp;#039;goodness&amp;#039; admission?  All the best to the loyalists of this thread, Selva
