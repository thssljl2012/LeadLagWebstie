       Gold bullion is in short supply, US Mint, Mexico, Western Europe are all hoarding- the mint says production is slow due to shortage of blanks, yet their inventory has remained the same for the past few years not 1 ioata of fluctuation-to better understand the gold story you might try gata.org-  you can buy gold maples or eagles for 60-90 over spot that is bullion not single coins and delivery is Not overnight there is a backlog and a delay in shipment due to &amp;amp;quot;supply constraints&amp;amp;quot;- spot is a futures contract and delivery is cumbersome but apparently there may be run for delivery and perhaps a default on comex because they may not have the gold available-  GLD I believe the holders is Barclays in london for their bullion and if you have 100k+ shares I believe you can ask for delivery it&amp;#039;s in their prospectus-= personally I dont like ETF&amp;#039;s they have sucked up demand for the metal in the case of gold and all you have is a digital record of ownership or a paper cert if you ask for it but you DONT have the GOLD-   I dont trust barclay&amp;#039;s or whoever is holding the gold period I trust the gold in my own hands or backyard or whatever, not even bank vaults as they were raided in europe as recently as this year and the owners are having problems legally- but it&amp;#039;s a problem either way-  no I dont own stocks either the mkt is NOT a mkt anymore- pure intervention at every turn and not being in the know as to when and what the interventionists will do I&amp;#039;d take vegas with better odds-
