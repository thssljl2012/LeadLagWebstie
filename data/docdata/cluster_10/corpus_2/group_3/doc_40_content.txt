 We have our savings in the above mentioned fund, recommended by financial advisor at Barclays. Minimum Risk.  Only had them since Jan 2008 and already since the trouble the value has dropped, now worth about 8,000 less than we put in. This was a long term investment and should we pull out now we would also get a large financial penalty in addition to the above loss.  We have dicided to take no action, but what happens if Legal &amp;amp;amp; General goes bust. Obviously shares go up and down, this we accept.
