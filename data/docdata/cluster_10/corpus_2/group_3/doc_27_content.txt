&amp;quot;barclays holds WAVX stock&amp;quot;      Can we please get this through this board&amp;#039;s head !!!      Barclays manages the U.S. Federal Employees Small cap 401k (403b)  fund. It is one of the largest retirement funds in the world. That  fund has a cool 15-20 BILLION in it. The fund states that it is  essentially the W-R 5000 minus the SP500.      The result? Barclays is attempting to mirror the performace of a  catagory of stock of which Wave is included.      Don&amp;#039;t ask &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; w/r to Barclays and Wave.      A computer picked Wave. It is a multibilliondollar index fund. It  tracks an index. Computers track indexes. Wave is in the index. The  computer selects a basket that will track. The computer is being  asked to invest billions and billions and billions of dollars. The  computer bought some Wave.      Why??      Because it is a computer. The average human knows better. So on the  silly question of why wouldn&amp;#039;t Barclays use Wave since they &amp;quot;hold  WAVX stock&amp;quot; I think you would need to find a computer that BOTH  handled index funds AND made basic IT purchases.      I&amp;#039;ve never met such a computer. PEOPLE make IT decisions, computers  run bazillion dollar index funds.      There is no &amp;quot;WHY&amp;quot; to link the two.
