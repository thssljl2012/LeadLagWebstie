I&amp;#039;d amend that to Weakest big name banks that have gotten all the  ink. There all lots of small fry sitting in the same position and  that dirty linen will have to be hung out as well. Also gov. seems  convinced that liquidity is the answer, but in fact the only two  bankers I know are paranoid about their assets, (not liquidity) ...  they are afraid that with anything like mark to market they are  woefully undercapitalized. The traders I talk to are getting really  bad vibes out of Europe. The folks in the US like Lehmann and  others were leveraged about 30 to 1 and ended up in the soup.  Barclays, Fortis Deutsche (about whom much has been heard) are  leveraged at double those levels or more ... net is lots of people  are putting money into bonds of all types and out of the market ...  very few people are trying to or feel the need to pick winners  now...park the money and wait for some retreat from hysteria. Then  expect a flight to quality (Intel) and pity the companies saddled  with debt that requires refinancing (AMD)      My 2 cents in these troubled times.
