Soon as that caught on, more and more people would follow, and you&amp;#039;d soon have a collapse due to indadequate capital adequacy ratios. Fractional Reserve Banking (wiki it)      The RBA doesn&amp;#039;t provide &amp;amp;quot;liquidity&amp;amp;quot; to the banks, and all the other measures that were going on many weeks before that before that for no reason.       You never know how these things are going, often until several years later when it&amp;#039;s safer to reveal such details. It&amp;#039;s not really safe to reveal such details at the time by any media outlets, and I imagine there are various protections in place to ensure media coverage is held to little or none. Panic begets panic as they say.                      I know this won&amp;#039;t stop the conspiracy theorists, but those of who are actually involved in these things weren&amp;#039;t worried about a run on deposits. The primary issue was that global liquidity was being skewed by those jurisdictions that had passed guarantees, raising the prospects of international capital raising becoming more difficult/expensive than it already was.      The fact that a bunch of poorly capitalised banks in Europe got govt backing wasn&amp;#039;t going to create a line of pensioners out the front of CBA withdrawing their cash so they could enter into Euro-denominated term deposits in Germany.          Anyway, still waiting for the evidence that Rudd or another govt rep. stated that the banks were on the brink of collapse
