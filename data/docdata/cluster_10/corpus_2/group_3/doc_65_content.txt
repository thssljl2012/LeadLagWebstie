Scary stuff:      &amp;quot;The financial storm has even been felt in the most unexpected of places, such as the offices of German town halls. At the turn of the millennium, hard-up German cities like Bochum, Recklinghausen and Wuppertal, used complex agreements, to sell large shares of the municipal family silver to US investors -- and then turned around to re-lease it.  In many cases these so-called Cross-Border Leases (CBL) -- in which entire sewage systems or municipal transport operations were sold off -- were insured by the   US   insurance giant AIG, which was recently nationalized to avoid bankruptcy.             Naturally, the small print of the CBL agreements contains an explosive clause. It stipulates that if the guarantor loses its top-rated AAA credit rating, additional collateral must be provided. Despite government intervention, AIG was downgraded. Under their CBL agreements, the affected city councils have only a few weeks to come up with a solution.           By contrast, their counterparts in the cities of Mnster,  Troisdorf ,  Munich  and  Frankfurt  can only wait and hope. They invested portions of their tax revenues with the  Frankfurt  subsidiary of now-bankrupt Lehman Brothers. By offering generous terms and citing a deposit insurance fund, the Americans managed to drum up urgently needed liquidity in   Germany   shortly before their bankruptcy.          The funds that German cities coughed up to help the Wall Street gamblers survive are not likely to be repaid anytime soon.   BaFin ,  Germany  &amp;#039;s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, has imposed a moratorium on the German subsidiary, freezing all transactions until further notice.&amp;quot;            http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,581502,00.html             &amp;amp;nbsp;
