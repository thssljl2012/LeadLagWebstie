            Quote from: Bluto Bukowski on  Yesterday  at 01:04:30 PM   Last year Merrill Lynch&amp;amp;#039;s chairman Stan O&amp;amp;#039;Neal retired after announcing losses of $8bn, taking a final pay deal worth $161m. Citigroup boss Chuck Prince left last year with a $38m in bonuses, shares and options after multibillion-dollar write-downs. In Britain, Bob Diamond, Barclays president, is one of the few investment bankers whose pay is public. Last year he received a salary of 250,000, but his total pay, including bonuses, reached 36m.   This is chump change when compared to the earnings of the top hedge fund managers:  &amp;amp;quot;NEW YORK: The top hedge fund managers took home dizzying sums last year, fed by a bull market in commodities and investors&amp;amp;#039; willingness to pay up for proven track records.  Institutional Investor&amp;amp;#039;s Alpha reported Wednesday the top 50 hedge fund managers earned a combined $29 billion (18.2 billion) in 2007. Five managers earned more than $1 billion (630,000 million).&amp;amp;nbsp;    One contributor to the enormous amounts of money hedge fund managers are making is the unraveling of the traditional &amp;amp;quot;2 and 20&amp;amp;quot; method of compensation. For years, funds typically charged 2 percent of the amount invested plus 20 percent of the profits.  Ezra Zask of Lakeville Capital Management, a hedge fund advisory, said some of the bigger hedge funds are now charging as much as 5 percent of the invested principal and 40 percent of the profits.  Some investors are willing to pay higher fees to funds&amp;amp;#039; managers if they show they have consistently beaten the market, Zask said.&amp;amp;quot;  Sorce: International Herald Tribune:  http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/04/16/business/NA-FIN-US-Hedge-Funds.php   Fund managers &amp;amp;#039;beat&amp;amp;#039; the market - Maybe some expert can explain why my simplification is incorrect, but it seems to be a zero sum equation - they take it, we lose it.&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;   Meanwhile, the banks can now buy back the devalued &amp;amp;#039;junk mortgages&amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;nbsp; at 50 cents on the dollar. They can then sell these to other institutions at 20 cents, and offset the 30 cents loss against taxes.  With costly wars and financial bail-outs to pay for, it looks like either social spending will decline, or we can further batter our balance of payments. Bush has famously doubled the national debt of the USA within a short 8 year period. Luckily, his tax breaks for the rich mean that there are now even more billionaires who can lend to the government in their hour of need, at a price of course.&amp;amp;nbsp;
