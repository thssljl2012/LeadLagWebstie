Her little inuendos and snarky comments brings out the worse in   humankind. That is what she is good at and why the republicans brought her   into the campaign. Whereas at the Obama rallies, people are happy, smiling,   and loving. That&amp;#039;s the difference between the two campaigns that is so   noticeable.      Palin spews hate, supposedly in the name of her Lord. I never want to see   her Lord. Eek!                    Weekend Edition   October 17 / 20, 2008      When Greed is Rewarded    Government of Thieves    By PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS       Just as the Bush regime&amp;#039;s wars have been used to pour billions of    dollars into the pockets of its military-security donor base, the    Paulson bailout looks like a Bush regime scheme to incur $700 billion in    new public debt in order to transfer the money into the coffers of its    financial donor base. The US taxpayers will be left with the interest    payments in perpetuity (or inflation if the Fed monetizes the debt), and    the number of Wall Street billionaires will grow. As for the US and    European governments&amp;#039; purchases of bank shares, that is just a cover for    funneling public money into private hands.      The explanations that have been given for the crisis and its bailout are    opaque. The US Treasury estimates that as few as 7% of the mortgages are    bad. Why then do the US, UK, Germany, and France need to pour more than    $2.1 trillion of public money into private financial institutions?       If, as the government tells us, the crisis stems from subprime mortgage    defaults reducing the interest payments to the holders of mortgage    backed securities, thus driving down their values and threatening the    solvency of the institutions that hold them, why isn&amp;#039;t the bailout money    used to address the problem at its source? If the bailout money was used    to refinance troubled mortgages and to pay off foreclosed mortgages, the    mortgage backed securities would be made whole, and it would be    unnecessary to pour huge sums of public money into banks. Instead, the    bailout money is being used to inject capital into financial    institutions and to purchase from them troubled financial instruments.      It is a strange solution that does not address the problem. As the US    economy sinks deeper into recession, the mortgage defaults will rise.    Thus, the problem will intensify, necessitating the purchase of yet more    troubled instruments.       If credit card debt has also been securitized and sold as investments,    as the economy worsens defaults on credit card debt will be a replay of    the mortgage defaults. How much debt can the Treasury bail out before    its own credit rating sinks?      The contribution of credit default swaps to the financial crisis has not    been made clear. These swaps are bets that a designated financial    instrument will fail. In exchange for &amp;amp;quot;premium&amp;amp;quot; payments, the seller of    a swap protects the buyer of the swap from default by, for example, a    company&amp;#039;s bond that the swap buyer might not even own. If these swaps    are also securitized and sold as investments, more nebulous assets    appear on balance sheets.       Normally, if you and I make a bet, and I welsh on the bet, it doesn&amp;#039;t    threaten your solvency. If we place bets with a bookie and the odds go    against the bookie, the bookie will fail, as apparently happened to AIG,    necessitating an $85 billion bailout of the insurance company, and to    Bear Stearns resulting in the demise of the investment bank.       Credit default swaps are a form of unregulated insurance. One danger of    the swaps is that they allow speculators to purchase protection against    a company defaulting on its bonds, without the speculators having to own    the company&amp;#039;s bonds. Speculators can then short the company&amp;#039;s stock,    driving down its price and raising questions about the viability of the    company&amp;#039;s bonds. This raises the value of the speculators&amp;#039; swaps which    can be sold to holders of the company&amp;#039;s bonds. By ruining a company&amp;#039;s    prospects, the speculators make money.      Another danger is that swaps encourage investors to purchase riskier,    higher-yielding instruments in the belief that the instruments are    insured, but the sellers of swaps have not reserved against them.       Double-counting of assets is also possible if a bank purchases a    company&amp;#039;s bonds, for example, then purchases credit default swaps on the    bonds, and lists both as assets on its balance sheet.      The $85 billion Treasury bailout of AIG is small compared to the $700    billion for the banks, and the emphasis has been on banks, not insurance    companies. According to news reports, the sums associated with credit    default swaps are far larger than the subprime mortgage derivatives.    Have the swaps yet to become major players in the crisis?      The behavior of the stock market does not necessarily tell us anything    about the bailout. The financial crisis disrupted lending and thus    comprised a threat to non-financial firms. This threat would reflect in    the stock market. However, the stock market is also predicting a    recession and declining earnings. Thus, people sell stocks hoping to get    out before share prices adjust to the new lower earnings.       The bailout package is a result of panic and threats, not of analysis    and understanding. Neither Congress nor the public knows the full story.    If the problem is the mortgages, why does the bailout leave the    mortgages unaddressed and focus instead on pouring vast amount of public    money into private financial institutions?      The purpose of regulation is to restrain greed and to prevent leveraged    speculation from threatening the wider society. Congress needs to    restore financial regulation, not reward those who caused the crisis.      Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan    administration.
