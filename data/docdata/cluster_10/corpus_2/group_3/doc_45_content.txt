         I&amp;#039;m getting rather annoyed with Halifax stockbroking service. In the last 2 months, I&amp;#039;ve had the following problems:  (i) Unable to buy Barclays shares a few weeks back on a dip at just over 3.00, when I would have certainly sold them for over 3.90 2 days later. (ii) Last week, shares in an ETF were sold at 6.8% above the mid-price prevalent at the time. (iii) Unable to sell shares in another government bond ETF on Friday, therefore unable to raise capital to take advantage of some superb share prices.  Can anyone recommend a better broker?  I need something which works well, so I can take advantage of the fantastic opportunities presented by these volatile markets.
