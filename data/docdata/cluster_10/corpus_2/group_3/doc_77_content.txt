 BAK Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              From the latest Marc Faber    My personal opinion is that BRIC should be shorted into the ground.   The European stuff is nice, but EM has only begun to fester.     I may hunt Weasel down for talking me into EDD. Perhaps I can convince myself it&amp;#039;s a hedge against my equity shorts.    Let us prey.    According to Daniel Gross, director of the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels, &amp;amp;#8220;the crucial problem on this side of the Atlantic is that the largest European banks have become not only too big to fail, but also too big to be saved. For example, the total liabilities of Deutsche Bank ( leverage   ratio over 50! ) amount to about &amp;amp;#8364;2,000bn (more than Fannie Mae) or more than 80 per cent of the gross domestic product of Germany. This is simply too much for the Bundesbank or even the German state, given that the German budget is bound by the rules of the European Union&amp;amp;#8217;s stability pact and the German government cannot order (unlike the US Treasury) its central bank to issue more currency. Similarly, the total liabilities of Barclays of around 1,300bn ( leverage ratio 60! ) are roughly equivalent to the GDP of the UK. Fortis Bank has a leverage ratio of &amp;amp;#8220;only&amp;amp;#8221; 33, but its liabilities are  three times the GDP of its home   country of Belgium&amp;amp;#8221;  (emphasis added).  &amp;amp;nbsp;In addition, I am not sure investors fully appreciate that earnings in emerging economies could be decimated next year .
