No Lex was trying to create land and make billions selling it if I remember...wait, I wonder who he&amp;#039;d be able to sell the land to now.. Maybe an A.R.M. for the first few customers who buy the first tracts of &amp;#039;LuthorVille&amp;#039;?  We can get AIG to help us with the mortgage insurance.
