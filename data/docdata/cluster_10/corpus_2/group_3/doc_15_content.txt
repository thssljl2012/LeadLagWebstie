    A market valued at 14 times earnings is not overvalued.&amp;amp;nbsp; A market at 25 times is overvalued.&amp;amp;nbsp; The market could go lower, but I doubt it.&amp;amp;nbsp; And, if it does, it won&amp;#039;t be by much.&amp;amp;nbsp; The question now is how quckly will it rise.&amp;amp;nbsp; I thought it would take til 2009 to fall to 8,000.&amp;amp;nbsp; Things just happen quickly in a bear downturn.&amp;amp;nbsp; But, timing is next to impossible.&amp;amp;nbsp; I am 57.&amp;amp;nbsp; I will not go into the market with my 401.&amp;amp;nbsp; I will stay in bonds.&amp;amp;nbsp; But, 45 or younger and you will still catch the next bull market.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   Housing too seems to have hit bottom.&amp;amp;nbsp; Sales in my market were up 42% over the same month last year.&amp;amp;nbsp; And pending sales are up 47%.&amp;amp;nbsp; The average sale price was $190,000 which is $50,000 - if my memory is correct - less than the peak price.&amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;   So, we seem to have bottomed.&amp;amp;nbsp; We have the credit issue.&amp;amp;nbsp; For me, it remains largely imcomprehensible.&amp;amp;nbsp; Sorta like time is relative.&amp;amp;nbsp; I know we have huge debt worldwide.&amp;amp;nbsp; I know debt drives progress.&amp;amp;nbsp; I just do not understand how debt larger than assets is meaningful.&amp;amp;nbsp; But, as i have said before.&amp;amp;nbsp; I am selfishly supporting the government intervention.&amp;amp;nbsp; I need money to grow.&amp;amp;nbsp; And, if the markets are frozen, thaw them out.&amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;   Recession?&amp;amp;nbsp; Yes it will come; probably already has.&amp;amp;nbsp; Sales are falling on cars.&amp;amp;nbsp; Need a car?&amp;amp;nbsp; I swear you will never get a better deal than right now.&amp;amp;nbsp; Here&amp;#039;s the thing.&amp;amp;nbsp; For the last 18 months I have been working as hard as I did when I was 22.&amp;amp;nbsp; I compete against China.&amp;amp;nbsp; And, I have made numerous posts on how I am fighting a losing battle due to wages, healthcare, and taxes.&amp;amp;nbsp; But, I really had no choice.&amp;amp;nbsp; Those were the rules and I can hate them, but Bush did not call me to see which ones I wanted to change.&amp;amp;nbsp; So, eventually&amp;amp;nbsp;I had to dig in and do something.&amp;amp;nbsp; I built my own website.&amp;amp;nbsp; I redesigned my line to go more upscale.&amp;amp;nbsp; If China owns the bottom, why compete.&amp;amp;nbsp; I di many other things too.&amp;amp;nbsp; And, last year my sales were up 25%.&amp;amp;nbsp; This year my sales are going to be up 25%.&amp;amp;nbsp; I have returned to profitability.&amp;amp;nbsp; And, I have strategies in place to offset sales declines with corresponding sales increases.&amp;amp;nbsp; Honestly, I have not been so excited about by business in 7 or 8 years.&amp;amp;nbsp; Then this shit happens.&amp;amp;nbsp; And, I am still not terrified.&amp;amp;nbsp; A recession won&amp;#039;t kill me.&amp;amp;nbsp; I absolutely believe I can offset sales declines by entering new geographic markets.&amp;amp;nbsp; The only thing that can kill me is if borrowing dries up.&amp;amp;nbsp; If that happens I am toast.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   I have net 30 days with my vendors.&amp;amp;nbsp; I pay them in 60 days.&amp;amp;nbsp; The industry average is 45 days.&amp;amp;nbsp; I have a line of credit with my bank.&amp;amp;nbsp; I don&amp;#039;t ever screw with my banker.&amp;amp;nbsp; He always gets paid on time.&amp;amp;nbsp; Now, if my vendors get squeezed and therefore squeeze me I have to reduce my inventory.&amp;amp;nbsp; Let&amp;#039;s&amp;amp;nbsp;say my vendors force me to pay in 45 days.&amp;amp;nbsp; That is a 25% reduction in working capital.&amp;amp;nbsp; In my case, that would be about $50,000 in lost capital.&amp;amp;nbsp; I turn that money 12 times a year.&amp;amp;nbsp; That is $600,000 in lost sales.&amp;amp;nbsp; And, for the bean counters who really want to know, you can now figure out my annual sales, or come very close.&amp;amp;nbsp; But, I need that $600,000 to remain profitable.&amp;amp;nbsp; So, if my credit gets squeezed I really am toast.&amp;amp;nbsp; Not really, I can add additional vendors and thereby get inventory.&amp;amp;nbsp; But, my purchase discounts go away since I will be buying smaller quantites from any one vendor.&amp;amp;nbsp; And my shipping cost - anyone want to discuss shipping costs with the price of oil - also increase since I am trucking in two orders rather than one.&amp;amp;nbsp; So, my profits go down without a price increase.&amp;amp;nbsp; And, competition - capitalism and all that - prevents me from raising my prices.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   I am far too personal here.&amp;amp;nbsp; But, I wanted to show how serious a credit squeeze is.&amp;amp;nbsp; So, I showed how a small reduction of 2 weeks of working capital truly strains growth.&amp;amp;nbsp; No, I am not afraid of a recession.&amp;amp;nbsp; But, fozen capital scares the heck out of me.&amp;amp;nbsp; And, I actually did have one vendor put the squeeze on my already.&amp;amp;nbsp; This vendor is just making a profit - just like me.&amp;amp;nbsp; He has tapped out his bank financing and therefore went to insurance on his receivables - not AIG but the same concept.&amp;amp;nbsp; That insurance company now dictates who he can give credit to.&amp;amp;nbsp; And, because I was paying them in 60 days I was cut off.&amp;amp;nbsp; So, now I have to eitther pay COD and lose 60 days of money, or go to a new vendor at 15% higher prices.&amp;amp;nbsp; The 15% translates to about 1.3% of reduced profit for me.&amp;amp;nbsp;And, it also represents about $8,000 of reduced working capital if I stay COD.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   So, I have been on the phone with that insurance company trying to get them to play ball.&amp;amp;nbsp; How was it resolved?&amp;amp;nbsp; They will give me a strict net 30 days.&amp;amp;nbsp; And, I have to send them my financials every month for their review.&amp;amp;nbsp; Well, although I try my damndest to influence the outcome.&amp;amp;nbsp; Here too, I don&amp;#039;t make the rules.&amp;amp;nbsp; I have now lost $4,000 of working capital.&amp;amp;nbsp; Yes, I can absorb this.&amp;amp;nbsp; But, if every vendor does this....&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Well, have I mentioned anything about toast?&amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;amp;nbsp;   Now, General Electric just had this same problem.&amp;amp;nbsp; They resolved it by borrowing several billion from their good uncle Warren Buffet.&amp;amp;nbsp; John Deere just had this problem.&amp;amp;nbsp; They resoved it by changing their interest rate from around 3.8% to 7.5%.&amp;amp;nbsp; Frozen money worries me far more than a recession.&amp;amp;nbsp; And, that boys and girls is my economics lesson for the day.&amp;amp;nbsp; That is what the government is trying to fix.&amp;amp;nbsp; Growth creates jobs.&amp;amp;nbsp; And, money creates growth.&amp;amp;nbsp; I added two employees this year.&amp;amp;nbsp; I can add two more next year if I don&amp;#039;t get squeezed.&amp;amp;nbsp; But, I need credit to do this.&amp;amp;nbsp; Now, compound my story by a million other small businesses and you can begin to understand the situation.&amp;amp;nbsp; I don&amp;#039;t need to comprehend &amp;#039;time is relative&amp;#039;&amp;amp;nbsp; Iwant to know the situation in detail.&amp;amp;nbsp; But, I don&amp;#039;t really need to.&amp;amp;nbsp; I can see its impact on me and therefore extrapolate it to other businesses.&amp;amp;nbsp; And, I now hope you can too, even though I told you far more about me than I care to
