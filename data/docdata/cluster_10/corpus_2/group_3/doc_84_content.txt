  The stock market plunging(though last week it rose 5%, and today it rose over 4%), is the result of the masses liquidating their 401Ks/IRAs/etc, and moving to cash equivalents, margin calls and massive hedge fund redemptions. The masses are panicking.   The bailout is about 100s of billions(if not trillions)of sub-prime loans bought by fnma/fhlmc, and packaged and sold to 1000s of pension funds, endowments and mutual funds; and insurance companies like AIG who insured them.
