Profitable companies used to issue a quarterly dividend check to shareholders that divided the profit in proportion to the number of shares held.  This practice has mostly stopped due to income tax rates being much higher than capital gains, so now the companies just build larger cash reserves that in theory are reflected in the stock price.  Now, the big bad thing is the derivitives.  Stock at least is an ownership stake in a real company, whereas a derivitive is, well, just *****.  It&amp;#039;s an investment based on investments, or a sort of insurance policy on another investment.  These things are so opaque and strange that even the funds holding them really don&amp;#039;t know what they are in many cases.  Also, a lot of this paper is leveraged heavily - ie: purchased with borrowed money, or not really backed by the issuer.  That&amp;#039;s what tanked AIG - they had a unit that issued a face value &amp;quot;insurance&amp;quot; type derivitive (credit default swap) of billions, while only actually having a few million in cash. These insured mortgage bundles against the borrower not paying up, which risk was totally impossible to gauge.    All the derivitives really boil down to &amp;quot;if X happens, I&amp;#039;ll pay you Y&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;if X happens, you pay me Y&amp;quot;.  That&amp;#039;s really it.  And these things are on the books of companies at hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of &amp;quot;face value.&amp;quot;
