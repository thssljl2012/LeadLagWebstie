How are they dragging people down?                      Where did those cheap houses come from?  People who were foreclosed upon?      I certainly cannot by the life of me look at this with your perspective.  How it benefits the avg person escapes me when we are losing more jobs because business will fail and not just those banks and financial institutions we&amp;#039;ve been hearing about like Bear Stearns and Lehman.  Some have been lucky enough to have been swallowed by larger entities like BofA or Barclays, but there are many employees that are going to be part of the collateral damage.    How do you see that as fortuitous?
