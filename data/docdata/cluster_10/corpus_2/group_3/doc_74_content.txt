    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Caution re trading TSX ETF&amp;#039;S    Just a heads up for anyone buying or trading TSX listed ETF&amp;#039;S.    All the active Barclays ISHARES, XIU, XEG, XFN etc, usually trade within pennies of their net asset values but during recent market volatility, they have often traded at wide discounts.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    For example, the xiu closed Friday @ 14 though the net asset value is $13.73. This is likely just do to volatility but could also be front running but I have also noted the reverse when the net asset value is well above the closing price level.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    All things being equal, if the market rallied 2% on Tuesday, the xiu might not move at all. In such a case it would simply be catching up with it&amp;#039;s nav.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    However, under the vast majority of market conditions, the active ETF&amp;quot;S always trade within a penny or two except immediately before going ex dividend which is of course not the case at present.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    For those who want to keep track of the etf nav&amp;#039;s, there are all listed through this link      http://ca.ishares.com/product_info/fund_overview.do?ticker=XIU&amp;amp;amp;search=true
