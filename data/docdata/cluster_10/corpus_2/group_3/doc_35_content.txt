         Would guess l&amp;#039;m like many who visit this board having placed a higher than normal percentage of their Capital/pension fund into cash in the last 18 months.l chose 100% gilts as long as l could achieve above the level or projected level offered in my Sipp wrapper(1% below base rate)having decided to go to cash the last thing l wanted was any risk attached to the decision.At the time Barclays,my provider only changed 75 per transaction which was great,however they now charge .25% which has added a nought to each deal. I split my cash into 3 tranches:-  TS09 Mar 09 now yields now 3.00. T009 Dec 09 yields now 3.27 TR4T Jun 10 now yields 3.57. Fine all invested above 5%.. However what to do next, I&amp;#039;m guessing part of my near date tranche will be invested back into the Stock Market,my problem is with things looking gloomy and to some degree being discounted,should l move further down the yield curve now ?The chances seem to be increasing that we could easily see rates  below 3% sometime next year,my options are as l see it... T6Q Nov 10 yield 3.53 . TR11 Nov 11 yield 3.97    T512 Mar 12 yield 4.17 ..
