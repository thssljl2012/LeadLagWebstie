With the telephone, people gave up some privacy. The car brought smog in its wake. What price, then, for the recently unveiled United Kingdom bank bailout? Less risk means less profit, so how about an industry consigned to much lower profitability -- such as return on equity (ROE) -- than investors have seen for the past decade?    Last week, the U.K. said it would issue 37 billion ($64 billion) in new debt to buy common and preferred shares in  Royal Bank of Scotland Group  (ticker: RBS) and the soon-to-be-merged  Lloyds TSB Group  (LYG) and  HBOS  (HBOOY), and will also guarantee about 250 billion ($433 billion) in bank debt.  Barclays  (BSC),  HSBC Holdings  (HBC) and Abbey National, a unit of Spain&amp;#039;s  Banco Santander  (STD), have said they have no plans to take part and will recapitalize from private sources.    Bailed-out shareholders face dilution as new capital is pumped in, and the loss of dividends until the banks buy back the government&amp;#039;s preferred. In RBS&amp;#039;s case, the state could end up owning almost 60% of the bank in the unlikely event that no one subscribes to an expected share rights offer. As painful as this will be, these are short-term issues.       The taxpayer cash injection, however, comes with far-reaching long-term implications for British banking in the form of some pretty big strings attached -- requirements that are likely to put a large dent into sustainable profitability. For example, the bailed-out banks must commit to maintaining mortgage lending and loans to small and medium-sized enterprises at 2007 levels, as well as provide help to struggling mortgage borrowers. Some directors will be appointed in consultation with the government, and executive pay will be subject to various constraints.    The most important change, though, will be that British banks will be required to operate with much higher capital ratios than most have maintained in the past. At RBS, notes CreditSights analyst Simon Adamson, the Tier 1 capital ratio rises by half to 12.7% pro forma. (Tier 1 -- essentially a bank&amp;#039;s common stock plus retained earnings expressed as a percentage of its average assets -- is a measure of the bank&amp;#039;s ability to absorb unexpected losses.)    Before this global crisis, a 6% ratio was considered adequate, and 8% strong. Profitability will be depressed in two ways: Higher Tier 1 not only locks up capital on the balance sheet that might otherwise have been earning money, but increases the denominator in the ROE equation.    The bailout puts the banks in a strong position to cope with the recession, improves their funding situation, and should allow them to get back to health at some point, Adamson says. However, by asking banks to maintain higher capital ratios and tighten up on risk, ROEs will consequently be lower in the future, even when the current phase of asset write-downs and credit losses has passed, he warns.    Bank ROEs of 20% are a phenomenon of the past decade&amp;#039;s use of leverage, and &amp;quot;you don&amp;#039;t have to go back that far to see single-digit ROEs,&amp;quot; he says. In other words, we&amp;#039;ll see them again.    In recent days, the industry has pushed back, so banks may yet wriggle out of some of the more onerous government constraints before the bailout is finalized.    But if the requirements aren&amp;#039;t modified, then &amp;quot;this is bad news for the City of London, for U.K. growth, and for bank profitability at those banks who comply,&amp;quot; contends Diana Choyleva, an economist with Lombard Street Research in London.    This is a partial nationalization of a large chunk of British banking, with a state-directed boost to the private sector lending at a time when the U.K. economy is stifled by excess debt. Stuffing even more debt down the throat of the overextended households and businesses will only condemn the British economy to a much more prolonged workout, seriously undermining its long term growth potential, she says.    As the rules stand, banks that partake will be at a disadvantage to the global banks that don&amp;#039;t have to meet such stringent requirements. And among the U.K. banks themselves, it&amp;#039;s likely that bailed-out institutions will be at a competitive disadvantage to those whose hands aren&amp;#039;t tied by government fiats.    Says one veteran banker at a firm that isn&amp;#039;t planning to take part: &amp;quot;The downside for those who take the bailout money is that to meet the government mandate to maintain mortgage volumes at 2007 levels, at a time of higher U.K. unemployment and consumer belt-tightening, will require giving up profit margin or even writing uneconomic business. The investment bank won&amp;#039;t get the funding it used to get and will have to retrench. And limits on executive pay will make it harder to attract the best talent.&amp;quot;    The silver lining is that U.K. bonds, particularly those of the bailout banks, look cheap, since they now carry a quasi-guarantee from the state, Adamson points out.    Well, that&amp;#039;s progress. Get used to it.
