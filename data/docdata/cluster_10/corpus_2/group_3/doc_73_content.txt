Market Scan      Deliverance For UBS      Lionel Laurent, 10.16.08, 4:30 AM ET       http://www.forbes.com/2008/10/16/ubs-switzerland-banks-markets-equity-cx_ll_1016markets06.html?partner=yahootix       LONDON - It had to happen eventually. the Swiss government said  Thursday that it would inject $5.3 billion into UBS, Europe&amp;#039;s  biggest banking casualty of the squeeze on subprime mortgage-backed  assets. Although the injection is in convertible bonds, once they  are converted, the Swiss government will be the proud owner of 9.3%  of UBS.      The Swiss government&amp;#039;s plan looks set to be the latest in a long  line of partial bank nationalizations across the world, from  Britain&amp;#039;s $63.4 billion investment in banks like Royal Bank of  Scotland (nyse: RBS - news - people ) and Lloyds TSB (nyse: LYG -  news - people ) through to the United States Treasury&amp;#039;s purchase of  $250.0 billion worth of financial stocks.      Shares of UBS (nyse: UBS - news - people ) plunged 8.9%, or 1.78  Swiss francs ($1.57), to 18.30 francs ($16.10) on Thursday morning  in Zurich. The bank is also setting up a special purpose vehicle,  mostly financed by the Swiss National Bank, in which it hopes to  throw up to $60.0 billion worth of toxic, mortgage-backed assets  that have wreaked havoc on its balance sheet. According to UBS,  that means its net exposure to American mortgages will be &amp;quot;nearly  zero.&amp;quot;      Credit Suisse (nyse: CS - news - people ), meanwhile, benefited  from its decision not to take on the government as a potential  investor. Shares of the bank only fell 1.5%, to 45.20 Swiss francs  ($39.77), after it said it had raised 10 billion Swiss francs ($8.8  billion) from &amp;quot;a small group&amp;quot; of private investors, including the  Qatar Investment Authority.      &amp;quot;Given the relatively low level of affected assets in its portfolio  and its good access to capital markets, Credit Suisse has decided  not to participate at this time,&amp;quot; said the bank, though it  &amp;quot;welcomed&amp;quot; the government&amp;#039;s rescue plan. The situation is not  unique: in Britain, banks including HSBC (nyse: HBC - news - people  ) and Barclays (nyse: BCS - news - people ) were able to dodge the  bullet of government investment by raising funds from private  sources. (See &amp;quot;Britain&amp;#039;s Bailout: The Winners And Losers.&amp;quot;)      The Swiss government sought to play down its involvement in UBS on  Thursday by stressing that the convertible notes could be sold on  to third parties or be withdrawn, but it also set out some strict  conditions for its participation. It said that it would be  &amp;quot;appropriately compensated&amp;quot; for taking on additional risk, and said  there would be tighter oversight and regulation of UBS from the  Swiss National Bank.       http://www.forbes.com/2008/10/16/ubs-switzerland-banks-markets-equity-cx_ll_1016markets06.html?partner=yahootix
