             I think the thought is that HSBC and Barclays are safe but it&amp;#039;s clearly all about perception. RBS were perceived as poorly run and suddenly a gold rush started and everyone took all their cash out sparking a self fulfilling prophecy. Britains 2nd biggest bank almost went bust.  I know here they&amp;#039;ve been keen to quash poor reporting and speculative stories with concrete statements, on Monday radio 5 reported Barclays had taken 6.5bn of refinancing from the government when in fact it&amp;#039;s merely raising that capital privately in order to meet the new capitalisation targets. That kind of story just before trading opens can be catastrophic so.. err.. I agree with aldfort                    --------------------
