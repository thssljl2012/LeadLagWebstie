         Just a Q on Barclays .. Do we actually believe they&amp;#039;ll be able to raise the necessary cash WITHOUT having to go back to the Gvmt fund ?? I&amp;#039;m not so sure - didn&amp;#039;t they try to prise some cash out of the far east before this all came to a head &amp;amp;amp; got knocked back ?? Personally, I&amp;#039;m not sure they&amp;#039;ll be able to raise it on their own so, IMO, potentially in that case another shock &amp;amp;amp; another round of scrutiny in the sector ..
