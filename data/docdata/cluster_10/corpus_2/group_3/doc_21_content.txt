$62 Trillion in Credit Default Swaps Is a Ticking Bomb   Sep 19th, 2008   By Shah Gilani   Category: Featured, News   The US subprime and credit crisis has cost the world over $7.7  trillion, according to a report released in February by Bank of  America.      The worst could yet be to come. Shah Gilani in Money Morning says  the $62 trillion market for credit default swaps (CDS) is a ticking  bomb.      The derivative instruments - which offer insurance against default  - are neither transparent nor regulated. But they are all at risk.  And they are already causing huge writedowns in the banking  sector&amp;amp;#8230;      This from Money Morning:         It used to be that regulators and legislators demanded theoretical,  empirical, and quantitative measures of the efficacy of new  tradable instruments being proposed by exchanges. What is their  purpose? How will they benefit the capital markets and the economy?  And, what safeguards will accompany their introduction?      Not any more. In the early 1990s, in order to hedge their loan  risks, J. P. Morgan &amp;amp;amp; Co. [now JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp;amp; Co.  (NYSE:JPM)] bankers devised credit default swaps.      A credit default swap is, essentially, an insurance contract  between a protection buyer and a protection seller covering a  corporation&amp;amp;#8217;s, or sovereign&amp;amp;#8217;s (the &amp;amp;#8220;referenced  entity&amp;amp;#8221;), specific bond or loan. A protection buyer pays an  upfront amount and yearly premiums to the protection seller to  cover any loss on the face amount of the referenced bond or  loan.   Typically, the insurance is for five years.      Credit default swaps are bilateral contracts, meaning they are  private contracts between two parties. CDSs are subject only to the  collateral and margin agreed to by contract. They are traded  over-the-counter, usually by telephone. They are subject to re-sale  to another party willing to enter into another contract. Most  frighteningly, credit default swaps are subject to  &amp;amp;#8220;counterparty risk.&amp;amp;#8221;      If the party providing the insurance protection - once it has  collected its up front payment and premiums - doesn&amp;amp;#8217;t have  the money to pay the insured buyer in the case of a default event  affecting the referenced bond or loan (think hedge funds), or if  the &amp;amp;#8220;insurer&amp;amp;#8221; goes bankrupt (Bear Stearns was almost  there, and American International Group Inc. (NYSE:AIG) was almost  there) the buyer is not covered - period. The premium payments are  gone, as is the insurance against default.      Credit default swaps are not standardized instruments. In fact,  they technically aren&amp;amp;#8217;t true securities in the classic sense  of the word in that they&amp;amp;#8217;re not transparent, aren&amp;amp;#8217;t  traded on any exchange, aren&amp;amp;#8217;t subject to present securities  laws, and aren&amp;amp;#8217;t regulated. They are, however, at risk - all  $62 trillion (the best guess by the ISDA) of them.      Fundamentally, this kind of derivative serves a real purpose - as a  hedging device. The actual holders, or creditors, of outstanding  corporate or sovereign loans and bonds might seek insurance to  guarantee that the debts they are owed are repaid. That&amp;amp;#8217;s the  economic purpose of insurance.      What happened, however, is that risk speculators who wanted  exposure to certain asset classes, various bonds and loans, or  security pools such as residential and commercial mortgage-backed  securities (yes, those same subprime mortgage-backed securities  that you&amp;amp;#8217;ve been reading about), but didn&amp;amp;#8217;t actually  own the underlying credits, now had a means by which to speculate  on them.      If you think XYZ Corp. is in trouble, and won&amp;amp;#8217;t be able to  pay back its bondholders, you can speculate by buying, and paying  premiums for, credit default swaps on their bonds, which will pay  you the full face amount of the bonds if they do actually default.  If, on the other hand, you think that XYZ Corp. is doing just fine,  and its bonds are as good as gold, you can offer insurance to a  fellow speculator, who holds the opinion opposite yours. That means  you&amp;amp;#8217;d essentially be speculating that the bonds would not  default. You&amp;amp;#8217;re hoping that you&amp;amp;#8217;ll collect, and keep,  all the premiums, and never have to pay off on the insurance.  It&amp;amp;#8217;s pure speculation.      Credit default swaps are not unlike me being able to insure your  house, not with you, but with someone else entirely not connected  to your house, so that if your house is washed away in the next  hurricane I get paid its value. I&amp;amp;#8217;m speculating on an event.  I&amp;amp;#8217;m making a bet.      The bad news is that there are even worse bets out there. There are  credit default swaps written on subprime mortgage securities.  It&amp;amp;#8217;s bad enough that these subprime mortgage pools that  banks, investment banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and  others bought were over-rated and ended up falling precipitously in  value as foreclosures mounted on the underlying mortgages in the  pools.      What&amp;amp;#8217;s even worse, however, is that speculators sold and  bought trillions of dollars of insurance that these pools would, or  wouldn&amp;amp;#8217;t, default! The sellers of this insurance (AIG is one  example) are getting killed as defaults continue to rise with no  end in sight.      And this is only where the story begins.      The Ticking Time Bomb   What is happening in both the stock and credit markets is a direct  result of what&amp;amp;#8217;s playing out in the CDS market. The Fed could  not let Bear Stearns enter bankruptcy because - and only because -  the trillions of dollars of credit default swaps on its books would  be wiped out. All the banks and institutions that had insurance  written by Bear would not be able to say that they were insured or  hedged anymore and they would have to write-down billions and  billions of dollars in losses that they&amp;amp;#8217;ve been carrying at  higher values because they could say that they were insured for  those losses.      The counterparty risk that all Bear&amp;amp;#8217;s trading partners were  exposed to was so far and wide, and so deep, that if Bear was to  enter bankruptcy it would take years to sort out the risk and  losses. That was an untenable option.      The Fed had to bail out Bear Stearns.      The same thing has just happened to AIG. Make no mistake about it,  there&amp;amp;#8217;s nothing wrong with AIG&amp;amp;#8217;s insurance subsidiaries  - absolutely nothing. In fact, the Fed just made the best trade in  its history by bailing AIG out and getting equity, warrants and  charging the insurance giant seven points over the benchmark London  Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) on that $85 billion loan!      What happened to AIG is simple: AIG got greedy. AIG, as of June 30,  had written $441 billion worth of swaps on corporate bonds, and  worse, mortgage-backed securities. As the value of these  insured-referenced entities fell, AIG had massive write-downs and  additionally had to post more collateral. And when its ratings were  downgraded on Monday evening, the company had to post even more  collateral, which it didn&amp;amp;#8217;t have.      In short, what happened in one small AIG corporate subsidiary blew  apart the largest insurance company in the world.      But there&amp;amp;#8217;s more - a lot more. These instruments are causing  many of the massive write-downs at banks, investment banks and  insurance companies. Knowing what all this means for hedge funds,  the credit markets and the stock market is the key to understanding  where this might end and how.      The rest of the story will be illuminated in the next two  installments. Next up: An examination of the AIG collapse, followed  by a look at how bad things could get, and what we can do to fix  the problem at hand. So stay tuned.
