World systems are now more powerful than any nation. Indeed, world leaders are now coming together trying to formulate global answers.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;    As for the U.S., the American Century was last Century, not this one....          1. Lehman Brothers and Bear Sterns have been wiped out, with Merrill Lynch taken over;    2.

One leading investor, Julian Robertson,&amp;amp;nbsp;states 80-85% of Americans are now bankrupt.    &amp;amp;nbsp;8.
