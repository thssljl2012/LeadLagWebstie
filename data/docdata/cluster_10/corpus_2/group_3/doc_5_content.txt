      From The Times   October 18, 2008    Lehman Brothers executives served with subpoenas     Tom Bawden in New York       A dozen past and present Lehman Brothers executives are reported to have been subpoenaed in connection with three grand jury investigations into the company&amp;amp;#8217;s bankruptcy.    The criminal investigations centre on whether the senior Lehman Brothers executives had sought to mislead the markets by making claims about the brokerage&amp;amp;#8217;s financial health that they knew to be false.    Harvey Miller, a bankruptcy lawyer with Weil, Gotshal &amp;amp;amp; Manges, which represents Lehman, confirmed that the group was facing three grand jury investigations that have been launched by prosecutors in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Newark, New Jersey.    Lehman Brothers refused to identify the 12 executives who have been issued with subpoenas.    Dick Fuld, the chief executive of Lehman, has consistently denied that he knew the true extent of the brokerage&amp;amp;#8217;s problems and insisted that his actions were appropriate on the basis of what he believed to be true.    Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy last month as an exodus of customers and billions of dollars of writedowns on investments related to sub-prime mortgages left it on the verge of a meltdown.    Speaking last week at a congressional hearing into the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Mr Fuld said: &amp;amp;#8220;No one realised the magnitude of these problems. I said what I believed to be true &amp;amp;#8212; that the worst of the impact to the financial markets was behind us. With the benefit of hindsight, I can now say that I, and many others, were wrong.&amp;amp;#8221;    Yesterday American media reports named Mr Fuld, Joe Gregory, the former chief operating officer of Lehman, and Erin Callan, the former chief financial officer, as among those who have been subpoenaed, but Lehman declined to confirm or deny the names of those served.     In addition to the subpoenas issued to Lehman executives, it is understood that Ernst &amp;amp;amp; Young, the group&amp;amp;#8217;s auditor, BlackRock, a Lehman creditor, and American Insurance Group (AIG), the insurer, have also received subpoenas.         http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article4965118.ece
