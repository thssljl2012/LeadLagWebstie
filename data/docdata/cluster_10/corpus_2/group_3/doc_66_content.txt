Just to add on to your post a little, something quite interesting regarding the proposed increase in FDIC insurance is that the FDIC is already in over its head insofar as its potential outstanding guarantees are concerned. If one major bank were to fail, the FDIC&amp;#039;s paltry reserves would get trampled. Increasing this guarantee does nothing in the very short term to increase the FDIC&amp;#039;s ability to pay the guarantees except make it more difficult. This extra coverage would have to come out of reserves collected from premiums somewhere down the line. The implication is, of course, that the FDIC has the unlimited backing of the Treasury. The Treasury, of course, only needs to create more money and voila. That, of course, means dollar devaluation.                      You might be right. The FDIC has about $45Bn in reserves, immediately on tap, although much of this is via the fed, with some made up via insurance (lets hope not with AIG). But there should be enough to make up the delta between a bank&amp;#039;s assets, and a maximum of $100,000 or even $250,000 per customer (who had that in the 1st place). It should be enough to support a few failures, or at least one huge failure. The number of people who actually have $100,000 in actual cash in basic accounts, is not as high as you might think and also remember that anyone with more than that, is actually helping bail other people out.          Quote:                         Now, a question/comment for you.     ~snip                     There are many circumstances where mark to the market valuation is critical, well practised, and entirely adhered to. The best example by far, is futures and options trading. Interestingly, futures are a great way to illustrate the entire market as a kind of microcosm; and it also happens to be the product I have been working with for the last few years, so I get to show off a bit.     Putting aside Options, lets just look at futures. As I&amp;#039;m sure you know, a future is simply a contract that oblidges the holder to buy stocks/shares at a specified price, at some point in the future. What&amp;#039;s interesting about them, is that they&amp;#039;re often traded by people who either already own the underlying stocks, or even more interesting, they&amp;#039;re traded by people who actually own the commodity in the first place (most Chicago traded futures are commodity based). The reason for both of these is actually to hedge against commodity shortages or price decreases, or stock valuation fluctuations. In fact, futures were literally invented to stabilise cattle prices and give cattle traders and farmers a more predicatable income.      The point I am making is that many of the instruments in the market, were actually designed to  reduce  risk - ironic eh? Most traders in my particular bank, have to have what&amp;#039;s called a &amp;#039;zero delta&amp;#039; across their trading books. This means, no exposure. Virtually every position is hedged or offset by futures, or bonds or treasury notes. Admitedly, we&amp;#039;re pretty conservative, but the practice is common.     Anyway, back to mark to market. Basically, anyone trading futures has to provide security against any potential losses. Usually about 10% of the contract value. The margin maintenance takes into account the daily movement of the underlying intrument value:     So if you bought 10 Oil Contracts (a lot size of 10,000?) with a trade price of $110 for December, and the current price of oil is $100, then your Mark to Market is -$1,000,000 (10*10,000*10). Your initial margin would probably be $100,000. If the next day the price of oil rose to $102, then your maintenance margin would be -$20,000 (i.e. you&amp;#039;d get money back). On delivery date, you&amp;#039;re in the money $100,000 for every dollar over $110. You can see here that for a bet of $10,000 (your outlay) you can get huge returns... however, the losses are limitless in theory, because the price could drop significantly, or you may have bet on a price drop, and it could rise by any amount. However if you&amp;#039;re an oil trader, and the price bombs, then you can dump your futures before contract price with a relatively small margin hit, and then buy the commodity at the lower price. So you can see how the hedging works.     So an instrument that was set up to create stability and certainty in the market, and ensure farmers got through the winter even if the corn failed, can be used by wheeler/dealer cowboys to make huge gains or losses. The margin calls pretty much prevent people like you and I from playing the game.     Now your point about how it&amp;#039;s possible to do a mark to market valuation Vs MBS, well it&amp;#039;s almost impossible, although people do try. And here is where a lot of economic whizz kids have been suggesting the crises is not one of credit, but one of valuation. Everyone assumes that every MBS is worth 20 cents to the dollar (this bail out assumes that), which is rediculous. Just because the housing market has fallen 15% in the last 6 months, doesn&amp;#039;t mean everyone will default. In fact, the fast majority of people will never default and so for all intent and purpose, the assets are worth the original contract price.      You might also be surprised at how much many banks do understand their own balance sheets. Any broker/dealer must understand extactly ( to the cent) how much of their positions/open trades/cash/obligations/loans/debts etc belong to the firm, Vs belonging to the customers (ruling 15c33). Anything that is in doubt, must be assigned to the seg account (customer) and therefore is considered frozen. You must also actually have that stock (you cannot borrow for the sake of 15c33). In fact, every Broker/Dealer in NY has to do provide this information every Tuesday and every month end (regardless of day). Much of it is automated, and this is possible because the data is available in real time.     I am not sure what immediate effect the bailout will have on the markets. Most of the damage is on &amp;#039;main street&amp;#039; not Wall St. Many economies are already slowing down, it won&amp;#039;t get people back in their homes (if they lost them) and it most certainly won&amp;#039;t help the dollar. It also straps the fed into a uncomfortable chair, because now if they raise interest rates, for example, they will be hurting their &amp;#039;investment&amp;#039;; meaning if the fed wants to avoid effective bankrupcy, it has to start thinking more commercially. In the long run, this could have horrific effects.                                         __________________       &amp;amp;quot; To be attached to a certain view and to look down upon other views as inferior - this the wise call a fetter &amp;amp;quot; -  Buddha         Phill Martinmaas 1983 - 2006 - RIP            MacBook      Black   - Core Duo 2.0ghz - 2 GB DDR2 RAM 100GB HDD - OS X  Leopard  - DVD-RW        Xbox360 @ 1080i      Live: Brooklyn Brit        &amp;amp;quot;Redistributing the wealth, as far as my hard work, that upsets me, that&amp;#039;s not right.
