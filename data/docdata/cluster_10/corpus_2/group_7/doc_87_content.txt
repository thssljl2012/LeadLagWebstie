"Mr Flowers, a former Goldman Sachs partner who is close to BofA,  currently manages about $3.2 bn of CICs money in a fund dedicated to  taking stakes in financial institutions...      The CIC fund  complements a $7bn fund that Mr Flowers has just raised from a wider  group of investors. Mr Flowers has structured that fund so that he can  exercise control rather than take minority stakes as private equity  firms have done in the past. CIC may invest additional sums in Lehman  alongside Mr Flowers and Bank of America...      There remains a slight chance that Lehman might be forced into a pre-packaged bankruptcy, some of these people believe....      Lehmans  plight is sure to raise questions both about regulatory oversight and  the consequences of mark to market accounting. Some bankers and private  equity tycoons including David Bonderman, co-founder of TPG and a  minority investor in troubled Washington Mutual, believe that in times  of stress, such accounting treatment can lead to a death spiral. Thats  because the sale of a small portion of assets at distressed prices can  force a firm to mark down the value of all its holdings, leading to  rising funding coststhe lifeblood of a securities firm ---and plunging  share prices.      Even before Lehmans fate has been sealed, there  has been quiet finger pointing, with the Securities &amp; Exchange  Commission likely to come under increasing criticism. That is because  the SEC is supposed to monitor broker-dealers to ensure that they hold  enough capital to support illiquid holdings such as Lehmans real  estate investments. But Lehman held these investments outside that  entity, and thus avoided heavy capital charges to which regulators  seemingly turned a blind eye.      If the regulators refuse to offer  a sweetheart deal to a potential buyer, it will change the trading  dynamic around troubled financial institutions, creating uncertainty  about what was becoming a safe one-way bet. So far, shareholders have  been almost completely wiped out while debt holders have been protected."       http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/09/financial-times-bofa-jc-flowers-cic.html          thread start
