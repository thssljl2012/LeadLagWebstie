The presidents "salary" is just not a meaningful measure of a business executives compensation. The $400,000 wouldn't even pay the taxes on the perks that would be taxable income for an executive.             By law the president's "perks" are not taxable to the individual holding that job. The same applies to many perks that corporate executives usually get and are not considered taxable income. In general, if it's not in the W2, it's not taxable.        SO pick another number, you think $400K is too low, what would a cap be?        Start from these numbers and bring them down:    (2007 yearly comp, source Forbes)    J. Dimon $20.7 million JPM Chase    K. Lewis $20.1 million Bank of America    J. Rohr  $18.4 million PNC    R. Kelly $14 million Bank of New York    J. Stumpf 12.8 million Wells Fargo
