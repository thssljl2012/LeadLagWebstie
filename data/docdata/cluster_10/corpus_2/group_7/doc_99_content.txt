as for the why bank with chase question, this is an adress read to all the big bank ceo's in washington this week:   Vikram Pandit, CEO, Citigroup. The government has already invested $45    billion in your bank, and it still doesn't seem close to stable. Your    stock is down 85 percent from a year ago, to less than $4. Investors    obviously expect a lot more bad news. What is the total amount of    federal aid you think Citigroup will ultimately need to regain its    footing? If it turns out you're lowballing by more than 10 percent, we'd like all of our money back.         Ken Lewis, CEO, Bank of America. Please stop telling us you did America    a favor by buying Merrill Lynch. You've coveted an investment bank for    years, and you're supposed to be smart enough to tell if the one you    finally end up buying is loaded with time bombs. You've been spending    your own money to buy up your company's depressed stock - down 84    percent over the last year - to show how much confidence you have in    Bank of America. But why should shareholders - and taxpayers - have    confidence in you? Hasn't your judgment been pretty shaky?       Jamie Dimon, CEO, JPMorganChase. You've emerged as one of the "good    bankers" whose firm appears to have avoided the worst excesses of greed    and bad judgment. We also appreciate the wry humility you've shown by    proclaiming that at JPMorgan, "we suck less." Pretty funny. So maybe you    can answer this conundrum: How are banks - which got into trouble by    gambling too much money on risky loans and securities - supposed to    solve the "credit crunch" by lending even MORE money to businesses and    individuals that are now more likely than ever to default on their    loans?       Lloyd Blankfein, CEO, Goldman Sachs. Your firm has received $10 billion    in government bailout funds . Why do you need it? Goldman lost money in the most recent quarter, but still earned $2.3 billion overall in 2008. One money-losing quarter, and you need the feds to come to the rescue? Shouldn't the barons of capitalism be able to nurse their own losses?       John Mack, CEO, Morgan Stanley. You too. $10 billion from the Treasury.    A loss in the fourth quarter, but a net profit in 2008 of $1.7 billion.    In your 2008 earnings release , you bragged about how Morgan Stanley strengthened its capital position in 2008, and earned record revenues from fixed incomes sales and equities and derivatives trading. Sounds like you're doing okay. So when do you plan to pay back the $10 billion?       John Stumpf, CEO, Wells Fargo. We're all wondering if your bank is about to go down the drain, like Citigroup and Bank of America, or if you really did manage to steer around the huge sinkhole that's swallowing everybody who funded the phony U.S. housing boom. If anybody knows, it's you. So is Wells Fargo in the clear? Or are you sitting on yet another banking debacle? If Wells Fargo is healthy, wouldn't you prefer to return that $25 billion in taxpayer money, so you can party in Vegas without getting lectured by Washington? Besides, we could use the money back - we've got other problems that are costing a bit more than expected.
