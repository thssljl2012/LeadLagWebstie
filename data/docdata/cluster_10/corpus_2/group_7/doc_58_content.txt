           Advertisements [ ? ]                            Feb. 3 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said its unfair for politicians to criticize Wall Street pay without differentiating compensation based on performance.   Its unfair to talk about us as one, Dimon, who was paid $1 million last year and didnt accept a bonus, said today at a conference sponsored by Crains New York Business. Not every company was responsible.   U.S. President Barack Obama and politicans worldwide have criticized financial industry executives for taking multi- million dollar pay packages after banks and brokerages racked up more than $800 billion of losses and writedowns on credit- related assets. Dimon, 52, is among CEOs including Bank of America Corp.s Kenneth Lewis and Morgan Stanleys John Mack who opted not to take bonuses for last year.   Pay got a little exuberant, and there were some legitimate complaints, Dimon said. But I dont think the president of the United States should paint everyone with the same brush.   New York-based JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank, doesnt have so-called golden parachutes or retirement packages, and all top executives must retain 75 percent of their stock- based compensation, Dimon said.    http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=a9O...                          ...
