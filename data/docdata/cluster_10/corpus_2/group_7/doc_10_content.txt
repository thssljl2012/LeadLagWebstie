          Bank of America Said to Defer Some Bonuses Over Three Years                      Quote:              Bank of America Corp. is deferring payment of 2008 bonuses of $50,000 or more at its capital markets and investment banking units over three years, according to people familiar with the matter.         Employees who had expected a bonus this month based on their 2008 work will instead get most of it in three annual installments, starting in February 2010, said the people, who declined to be identified because the plan isnt public.         A fraction of each bonus -- perhaps less than 10 percent of the amount due -- will be paid in quarterly installments this year, the people said. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank will pay interest on the remainder at the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, they said. The rate for three-month dollar loans yesterday was 1.18 percent.
