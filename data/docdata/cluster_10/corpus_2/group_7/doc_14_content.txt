Is this the reason banks are running? Markit Announces Multi-Bank, Cross-Asset Valuation PlatformLast update: 2/25/2009 2:16:26 PMLONDON (Dow Jones)--Financial information services company Markit and six dealers announced Wednesday the launch of a single platform providing derivatives and cash securities prices to investors. Citigroup (C), Credit Suisse (CS), JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC) and UBS (UBS) are supporting what Markit called "the first multi-bank, cross-asset client valuations platform." Markit said it expects additional banks to participate. The initiative was first announced in February 2008, and the launch was originally scheduled for the second half of 2008. The platform, called the Markit Valuations Manager, will give investors access to dealers' valuations on over-the-counter derivatives and cash instruments. Investors will be able to compare these with Markit's own valuations. -Mark Brown, Dow Jones Newswires; +44 (0)207 842 9485; mark.brown@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones NewswiresFebruary 25, 2009 14:16 ET (19:16 GMT)
