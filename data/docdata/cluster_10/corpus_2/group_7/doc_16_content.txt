         So if the feds are propping up Bank of America and others, can anyone tell me why it would be a dumb move to purchase B of A bonds set to mature in the next couple of years, rather than stock?  It seems like there is an extremely low chance that they will default on their bonds, but am I missing something screamingly obvious here?
