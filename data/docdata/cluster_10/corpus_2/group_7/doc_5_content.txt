"Fed Sued     Bloomberg requested details of Fed lending under the Freedom of  Information Act and filed a federal lawsuit against the central bank  Nov. 7 seeking to force disclosure of borrower banks and their  collateral. Arguments in the suit may be heard as soon as this month,  according to the court docket. Bloomberg asked the Treasury in an FOIA  request Jan. 28 for a detailed list of the securities it planned to  guarantee for Citigroup and Bank of America. Bloomberg hasnt received  a response to the request."        Maybe the TPTB trained the groundhog to bite Mayor Bloomberg?    LOL.  IMO.  :)                        thread start
