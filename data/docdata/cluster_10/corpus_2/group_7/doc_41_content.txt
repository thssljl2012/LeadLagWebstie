WASHINGTON (AP) - While the Obama administration begins conducting "stress tests" on the nation's biggest banks to judge whether they can hold up if the recession were to worsen, there was fresh evidence of a weakening housing market with sales of existing homes falling unexpectedly last month to the lowest level in nearly 12 years.    Banking regulators plan to scrutinize the financial conditions of Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and more than a dozen other institutions that have received billions from the Treasury Department's $700 billion bailout pot.       The tests will help regulators decide whether the banks have sufficient capitaland the right mix of itto withstand any additional shocks to the economy over the next two years.       The tests also will help regulators decide whether the banks may need additional assistance so that they can carry out the critical mission of boosting lending to customers, a key ingredient to the economic turnaround.       On the housing front, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that sales of existing homes fell 5.3 percent to an annual rate of 4.49 million last month, from 4.74 million units in December. It was the weakest showing since July 1997 and well below the slight rise in sales that economists expected.       The median sales price plunged to $170,300, from $199,800 a year earlier. That was the lowest price since March 2003 and the second-largest drop on record.       Wall Street slumped on the news. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down about 85 ahead of the report, lost more than 150 points in morning trading.    http://www.breitbart.com/article.php...show_article=1
