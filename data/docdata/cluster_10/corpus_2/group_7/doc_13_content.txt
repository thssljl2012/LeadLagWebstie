This article has it written a little bit different.   My first thought was concerning the enbolden area.   Where is the other $350 Billion from the TARP?   That would be more than enough to cover the only $40 Billion estimated and whatever else might be additional.   I didn't think that money was destributed yet? Or are my figures off?            The FDIC has already raised the estimate for the cost of U.S. bank failures through 2013 after fourth-quarter financial reports from banks signaled possible additional losses to the deposit insurance fund. The agency said failures through 2013 may cost more than the $40 billion estimated in October.       The U.S. seized 534 lenders in 1989, including 327 saving- and-loan associations, during the peak of a crisis among thrift institutions, FDIC   data   showed.      &#8216;Nowhere Near the End&#8217;       http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?p...4vw&amp;refer=home
