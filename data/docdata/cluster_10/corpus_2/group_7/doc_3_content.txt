          7) Bank of America will be the undisputed leader of the new economy. Im excited about being invested in the largest retail brokerage (Merrill Lynch), the largest mortgage lender (Countrywide), and a bank who has been profitable for 17 years in a row, including 2008 (Bank of America).    all those people sold out at 1.90 will sure be sorry!  seriously, sub $2 stock is a go-to-zero. I challenge the board to come up with an example of a $2 to $20 stock. I am sure we can come up with a few if we think hard enough, but not an example as large as BAC. I bet there is simply no precedent for it.
