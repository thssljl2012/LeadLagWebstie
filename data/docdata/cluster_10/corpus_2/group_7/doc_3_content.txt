 Sort of off the topic...but weren't the CEOs of Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, JP Morgan et al. summoned to Washington to meet with Paulson, Bush, and Co. and told they had to take the government's capital investment (or bailout if you will)? I thought I remembered reading that it wasn't really an option for the largest banks. Maybe I heard wrong...
