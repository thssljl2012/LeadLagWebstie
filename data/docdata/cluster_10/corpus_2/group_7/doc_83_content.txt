 FNM Message Board Posts          Recs: 1              Banks agree to halt foreclosures - wonder what this will do to ABS market   Great news as homeowners can immediately stopping payments on their mortgages! But I do wonder what this will do to the already distressed ABS (asset backed securities) market, where debts collateralize bonds and market instruments.  Is anyone going to ever want to buy structured finance products ever again, when this precedent exists   for screwing the holders of debt-collateralized securities   ?    Feb 16 - Country's largest banks suspend foreclosures       Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup Inc. have agreed to halt home foreclosures while the federal government works out a plan to stabilize the nation&#8217;s banking industry.  &#8220;We will not add to the foreclosure process any new owner-occupied residential loans that are owned and serviced by J.P. Morgan Chase,&#8221; said J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon in a Feb. 12 letter to Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.  That moratorium would remain in effect through March 6.  Citigroup said it would put a moratorium on foreclosures of Citigroup-owned loans on principal residences, among others. Citi&#8217;s moratorium is scheduled to last until March 12, barring federal action before then.  San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, one of the nation&#8217;s largest mortgage lenders, joined the moratorium Friday along with Bank of America.
