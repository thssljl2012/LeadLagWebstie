         Bank failures become a problem when there are not enough bigger, healthier banks to absorb the failed banks.  Instead of just changing the names on the branches and reshuffling the numbers in the accounting statements, you get realized losses on debt obligations of the bank.  In a bad enough case this may actually effect depositors (although that's much less likely).  If a Citi or Bank of America defaults on its debt, it's very likely that other banks (which each hold significant portions of their fixed income portfolios in Citi or BoA debt) would go down as well.  Credit conditions for small businesses and even large business become considerably tighter, costs of funding for businesses rise, and projects that were economical at old interest rates no longer get started.  GDP growth slows (or GDP shrinks), etc etc.  Financing is very important to the economy, and bank defaults crush the financing market.
