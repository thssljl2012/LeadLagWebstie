The "few hundred billion of fed funds" is incorrect.    Bank of America was first given $15 billion in TARP funds.  Merrill Lynch was given $10 billion.  BofA got ML's $10 billion as a result of the purchase of ML.  Then BofA got another $20 billion to help offset the cost of acquiring ML.      They shouldn't have gotten any of it.  That last $20 billion I guess was to make up for the bank's lack of due diligence reflected by the shockingly high offer for ML.  Morgan Stanley got a much better deal when it acquired Bear Stearns.    There was no "few hundred billion of fed funds".  I believe you are referring to the federal loan guarantees in the range of $100 to $120 billion (I don't recall the exact amount).  Unlike the $45 billion in taxpayer debt, that $100 billion hasn't been laid on the backs of the taxpayer yet.      Give it time.  I'm sure it will be.
