The Washington Post   reports  :     Quote:                         J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup announced temporary moratoriums on foreclosures today at the urging of a key House member.     Top executives from these firms endured tough questioning before the House Financial Services Committee earlier this week, including about whether the banks have done enough to help struggling homeowners. In public statements and letters to the committee released today, Citigroup and J.P. Morgan sought to show the extent of their efforts.     J.P. Morgan Chase said it would not begin the foreclosure process on any owner-occupied properties until March 6. "We believe three weeks is adequate time for the Treasury to announce -- and for us to implement -- a new plan," Jamie Dimon, Chase's chief executive, said in a letter to Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), chairman of the committee.                     The focus here is the REAL why the banks are doing this. I think everyone here at GA knows why.
