   Nearly 100 federal banking regulators descended on    Citigroup    in New York on Wednesday morning. Dozens more fanned out through    Bank of America   ,    JPMorgan Chase    and other big banks across the nation.      It was just another workday. For years, regulators have embedded themselves inside the nations major banks to monitor their financial health.       But now these regulators could become the arbiters of American finance. Treasury Secretary    Timothy F. Geithner    is empowering them to decide which banks are strong enough to survive on their own  and which must be compelled to accept new bailouts from Washington, along with any strings that might be attached to them.       http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/business/12stress.html?ref=business
