Lewis dismisses need for nationalization of BAC SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis dismissed investors' concerns about the possible nationalization of Bank of America and denied the need for further financial aid, according to an internal memo cited by media reports Saturday. "I see no reason why a company that is profitable, with capital and liquidity levels that are very strong, and that continues to lend actively, should be considered for nationalization," Lewis said in the memo, sent to his staff and titled "Rough week for stock, good week for business." http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/b-ceo-lewis-dismisses-need/story.aspx?guid=%7B8F889216-B81F-41E5-AD0D-F2ABBB8ED78B%7D What he didn't say: The government has so far injected $45 billion into Bank of America as a part of its relief package for the ailing financial industry Merrill handing out $3 billion in bonus money, he has been subpoened. Does Lewis define profitable and liquid with continued socializing of BAC losses. And profitable if tax dollars are continued to be pumped into his ever bigger, more gigantic more too big to fail monster? Sorry Wall Street, the taxpayers are becoming very pissed off at socializing of their losses as they continue to find ways to award bonus money, "rentention awards". The TARP welfare wagon for the ultra wealthy is about to be pulled. Geitchner's details coming this week. Washington knows Taxpayers will be watching closely.
