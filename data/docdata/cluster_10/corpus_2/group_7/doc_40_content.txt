J.P. Morgan's Abusive Excutives Bonuses As readers will recall, J.P. Morgan received the first large bail-out from the New York FED of $55 Billion, guaranteed by Bear Stearns' worthless assets, to prop up its own liquidity position and buy Bear Stearns stock. J.P. Morgan also recently received another $25 Billion in TARP payments from the Treasury. This article is about how J.P. Morgan's executives , instead of receiving easy to detect cash bonuses, received very large bonuses in the form of Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) and Restricted Stock Units. These equity compensation securities are not easy to understand or value by other than experts in the field. SARs are very similar to employee stock options and Restricted Stock Units are very similar to Restricted Stock. These SARs were granted on January 20, 2009, the day that the J.P.Morgan stock reached its lowest in five years. The stock quickly rebounded as illustrated in the graph below. The arrow indicates the day and the price of the stock when the grant was made. On January 22, 2008 we see a repetition of the grants of SARs with the stock hitting a low point followed by a substantial rebound in the next days. Let's examine the size of the bonuses of the top 15 executives, at J.P. Morgan, that were granted on January, 20, 2009 and reported two days later.

The New York Attorney General is supposedly investigating Merrill's executives for criminal wrong doing Merrill CEO, Thain was granting himself just $10 million whereas at least three Morgan executives exceeded that in equity compensation alone. An interesting question arises from an examination of the fact that for the past two years grants were made on or around January 20. It just happened that the stock dropped prior to the grant and moved upward immediately after the grants. Its hard to accept the idea that those executives just got very lucky for two years in a row. Yes, I am suggesting collusion in the manipulation of the stock to accommodate the grants of options etc. Some refer to this as spring-loading the options grants. Is J.P. Morgan immune from investigation? Now what we find is that bankers' errand boy extraordinaire CEO, James Dimon, is popping off about the ridiculous idea that J.P. Morgan does not need further bail-out money after Morgan grabbed $55 Billion in the Bear Sterns deal and another $25 Billion of TARP money in banker welfare payments. See: http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=azVLk.22AkLI If they do not need the bail-outs, let Morgan and Goldman return the welfare payments. Perhaps also an explanation is in order of why James Dimon is not prosecuted for violations of Title 18 Section 208 U.S.C. in his role as Director of the New York Federal Bank in approving the J.P. Morgan/Bear Stearns deal. http://law.onecle.com/uscode/18/208.html Neither J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs or any other bank will return the TARP monies because the actual values of the Preferred Stock and Warrant packages were 50% lower than what the taxpayers were forced to pay. And the actual values of those packages have dropped considerably in every case since the welfare payments to Goldman, Morgan , Bank of America etc. were made. In the case of Bank of America and Merrill, the warrants purchased by the Treasury are down over 88% since the bail-out. John Olagues P.S. A full reading of the SEC Form 4.com link above shows that there were sales of stock by most of the 15 executives at 23.2 in the days following the issues of the SARs and RSUs granted when the stock was 19.49. Mr. Jamie Dimon also sold 137,033 shares of stock at 23.2. The sales and the grants are trades of equity securities within 6 months and are considered matching trades for Section 16 b of the Securities Act of 1934. Section 16 b requires those profits from the buys and sales to be "short swing" profits and are returnable to J.P. Morgan. Now, securities attorneys will say that the grants of the SARs and RSUs are exempt under SEC Rule 16 b-3. However, the Rule effectively defeats the Statute and therefore is beyond the SEC's Rule making authority and is void. SEC Rule 16 b-3 is just another part of the SEC accommodating the executive compensation abuses including back-dating and spring loading. If you are a holder of JP Morgan stock you can request that Jamie and his boys return their "short swing" profits. If they do not return the money, any share holder has a private right of action against Jamie and his boys to get the profits returned to the share holders.
