SEC chief leaves under Madoff cloud WASHINGTON: - Mr Christopher Cox stepped down as US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman on Tuesday, leaving behind a demoralised agency that failed to spot Bernard Madoff's alleged fraud and had its role diminished by the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. During Mr Cox's 31/2-year tenure, the SEC has been criticised by lawmakers, investors and its own inspector-general as being deferential to Wall Street. President Barack Obama picked Ms Mary Schapiro, head of the US brokerage industry's self-regulator, to succeed Mr Cox. The agency lost its clout in March when the Federal Reserve rescued Bear Stearns and began lending to and examining investment banks regulated by the SEC. Its domain shrank further in September after Lehman declared bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch sold itself to Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became Fed-regulated commercial banks. Another blow came in December when Mr Cox, 56, admitted the SEC missed Madoff's alleged Ponzi scheme despite 'credible' complaints for a decade.
