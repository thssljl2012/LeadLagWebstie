           Advertisements [ ? ]                         Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) wont live to see May. The government will take them over within the next 60 days. The announcement may come as soon as tomorrow evening.  &lt;snip&gt;  Were going to make another bold prediction. Bank of America and Citigroup wont live to see May. The two banks will be nationalized in the coming weeks, and we think that the announcement can come as soon as tomorrow evening (Friday evenings are when major bank announcements and failures occur).  The US government has already committed half a trillion dollars to these two firms which is more than 10 times the amount it would cost to buy and control both companies. The market doesnt believe that $500 billion is enough to save these companies.  All the kings horses and all the kings men cant  put humpty dumpty back together again.  Today both banks made fresh new lows with Citi closing at $2.51 and Bank of America closing at $3.93.    http://www.chartingstocks.net/2009/02/gone-in-60-days-c...  /                                                            Donate to DU and give valentine hearts to your friends!
