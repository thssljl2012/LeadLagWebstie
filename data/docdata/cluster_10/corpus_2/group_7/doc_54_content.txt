They relied too much on borrowed money, lent   too freely to shoddy customers and got taken in by their own   sophisticated financial models.        So you would think the last thing anyone would want to do is   rely more heavily on their judgment in the hope theyll do better   next time.        Unless, that is, youre a banker. Many believe one way to   prevent todays troubles from recurring would be to give banks   more wiggle room over how much money they put aside to cover   loans that might go bad. That would let them build up rainy day   funds when times are good so they can bolster profit during   slumps.        Too bad this kind of smoothing of earnings wont help   restore confidence. It also reflects the kind of its not our   fault song and dance that too many bankers are engaging in,   both with investors and on Capitol Hill.        If we want banks to store nuts for winter, lets prevent   them from paying out too much in dividends and share buybacks   during good times. Those outlays wouldnt lead to games with   earnings that can give investors a false sense of comfort.        Consider that between 2003 and 2007 Citigroup Inc. paid out   about $44 billion in dividends and about $22 billion buying back   stock. The combined outlay is about four times more than its   current market value, and much more than what the government has   shelled out to keep the bank afloat.                               Little Faith        A little restraint back then might have left Citi in better   shape today. Instead, investors wind up with little faith in   banks books. Their numbers are so dubious that Treasury   Secretary Timothy Geithner now wants special stress tests to   figure out which banks can survive without more government   handouts.        Whats amazing is that after all this, bankers want even   more leeway over reserves for potential soured loans, one of the   most subjective areas of the balance sheet. Thats because these   estimates involve guesswork about borrowers and economic   conditions, now and in the future.        Some bankers believe onerous rules regarding the way these   reserves are calculated prevented them from building up enough of   a buffer before the current crisis exploded.        The problem is these reserves can easily be used by banks to   manage their numbers, or manipulate earnings.        The financial crisis is giving new life to this debate.   Former Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig argued during a   meeting last week of a body called the Financial Crisis Advisory   Group that banks need much more flexibility over reserves.                            Bankers Know Best         Dont second guess the judgment of executives when it comes   to these estimates, he told the group, which was formed last year   to consider financial reporting issues arising from the market   turmoil. Let banks build reserves as high as they want, said   Ludwig, who from 1993 to 1998 headed the agency that regulates   U.S. national banks.        The catch is that banks already have leeway in how they   build reserves; they can add to them when there is broad evidence   a loan might become delinquent, not just when it actually happens   or is about to.        A group of U.S. bank regulators put out guidelines in   December 2006 to remind banks of this. The regulators did this   because reserves had fallen so low at many banks.        While banks let reserves shrink at a time when delinquencies   were falling and home prices soaring, the fear was that many were   deliberately tamping down reserves to help meet expectations for   soaring profits during the boom.                                Game Room        Plus, history has shown that too much freedom over loan-loss   reserves isnt such a good thing. Speaking at the same crisis-   group meeting, Dennis Chookaszian, former chief executive officer   of CNA Insurance Companies, pointed out that in the early 1970s   banks had the latitude some now seek. This was curtailed, he   added, because it gave banks too much flexibility to set   earnings.        The dilemma is how to avoid such abuse while letting   regulators push reluctant banks to be better prepared. David   Tweedie, head of the International Accounting Standards Board,   suggested that regulators require banks to hold on to some or all   of their after-tax profit, which can be used for dividends or   stock buybacks.        The idea would be to create an account, or reserve, within   shareholders equity, or the net worth of a firm. This would be   money that banks couldnt draw down without approval from   regulators. At the same time, investors could easily see how much   of a cushion a bank had.        Sure, some investors would cry foul over limits on dividends   and buybacks. Banks themselves would likely balk since many see   dividends as sacrosanct. Even today, after receiving government   bailout funds, banks such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Wells Fargo   &amp; Co., persist in paying dividends even though they should be   conserving capital in case economic conditions worsen.        Another possible hurdle: regulators themselves. They would   have to intervene in bank affairs in a new, more forceful way.        As troubling as that may be, its a better than the kind of   mass sell-off of banking stocks rocking markets today. Or to   openly allow banks to distort their numbers.
