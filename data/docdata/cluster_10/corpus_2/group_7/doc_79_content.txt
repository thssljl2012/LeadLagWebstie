           Bank of America employees have filed a class action lawsuit, claiming the company failed to comply with the law in administering employee retirement funds.     http://www.investmentnews.com/apps/p.../REG/902049987     BofA is the largest bank in the U.S.  The BofA stock price today dropped to its lowest value in more than 20 years, and also supposedly there are "persistent rumors" about BofA being outright nationalized.  A person has to wonder if it might as well be, since U.S. taxpayers seem to be stuck now with the expense of the whole dam' company, anyway.
