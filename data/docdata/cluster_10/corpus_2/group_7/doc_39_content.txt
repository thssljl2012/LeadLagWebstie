                             Link....    Quote:       CIA Nominee Panetta Received $700,000 in Fees          WASHINGTON -- The White House's nominee for Director of the Central  Intelligence Agency, Leon Panetta, has earned more than $700,000 in speaking and  consulting fees since the beginning of 2008, with some of the payments coming  from troubled financial firms and from a firm that invests in contractors for  federal national security agencies, according to financial disclosures released  Wednesday.  Mr. Panetta received $56,000 from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. for two speeches  and $28,000 for a speech for Wachovia Corp., according to disclosures released  ahead of Thursday's scheduled Senate hearing on Mr. Panetta's nomination.   Both Merrill and Wachovia reported big losses last year and were acquired by  larger firms. The Wachovia honorarium was dated October 30, and the last Merrill  Lynch honorarium was dated October 11, according to disclosure forms filed by  Mr. Panetta in connection with his nomination. At the time, Bank of America had  agreed to a rescue of Merrill Lynch; Wachovia had agreed to be acquired by Wells  Fargo &amp; Co.  &gt;  Mr. Panetta also received a $28,000 honorarium from the Carlyle Group, a  private equity firm that owns companies doing business with national-security  agencies of the U.S. government. Carlyle holds a majority stake in the  government consulting arm of Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., which works for the CIA  and other agencies. A Carlyle spokesman said Mr. Panetta was paid to speak at an  investor conference and that the matter was unrelated to Booz Allen or any other  defense contractors.  &gt;
