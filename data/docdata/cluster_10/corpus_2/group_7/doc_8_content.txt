         Yup, that was how it appeared and was reported.  I guess I am questioning if he did a good job :-) From the outside it looks like they did their due diligence to come up with Ken Lewis.  But, it is a difficult thing to replace a leader.  McColl was great at acquisitions.  But, as he exited he seemed to point to Ken as someone better at serving customers.     In 2001 McColl said.  "As president and COO, Ken has provided the leadership that has begun our transformation from a company that grows through mergers and acquisitions to a company that grows by attracting, retaining and expanding customer relationships. "Ken Lewis' leadership is what this company needs to achieve the goals we've set for customers, associates and shareholders," McColl said.  "I congratulate Ken and have great confidence that he and his management team will lead Bank of America to great success."    I can't help but wonder if Ken has been trying to emulate Hugh's ability to pull together blockbuster deals and make them work.  From Hugh's quotes it sounds like he intended Ken to be a customer champion.  There are obviosuly a lot of smart people at BAC.  It is hard to say how much influence one man has in a comapny of 200k employees.  Soc (Who worked for BAC many years ago, heard Ken and Hugh speak, and was never as impressed with Ken)
