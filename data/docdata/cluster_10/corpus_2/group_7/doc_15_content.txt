    http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/meltdown  / FRONTLINE investigates the causes of the worst economic crisis in 70 years and how the government responded. The film chronicles the inside stories of the Bear Stearns deal, Lehman Brothers collapse, the propping up of insurance giant AIG, and the $700 billion bailout. Inside the Meltdown examines what Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke didnt see, couldnt stop and havent been able to fix.      At least we're starting to get some more in depth explanations.
