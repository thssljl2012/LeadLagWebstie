Pension Deficit Disorder [Companies who have a large number of employees with defined-benefit retirement plans warrant some added scrutiny these days. Fortunately, many of the companies discussed on this board are not in this group.] http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123438982726574581.html FEBRUARY 12, 2009 By JOHN JANNARONE Investors already have seen their equity holdings hammered by the economic crisis. But, in some cases, they are discovering that companies are exposed to the down cycle twice over. Operating profits are collapsing. But pension deficits also are ballooning because of the stock-market dive. Absent a sudden market recovery, those will likely be made up in hard cash, undermining profits for years to come. S&amp;P 500 companies had a combined pension deficit of $376 billion at the end of 2008, according to Bank of America. Many companies with defined-benefit plans had more than half their assets in equities at the end of 2007. If all that was in the U.S., they still lost 40% last year. Falling interest rates, meanwhile, increased the present value of pension obligations for some. [I.e., lower interest rates mandate a lower time discounting of future pension obligations, which raises the present value of such obligations and lowers shareholders equity on the balance sheet.] Shares of technology-services company NCR fell 15% Feb. 5 after the company said it would contribute $120 million to its pension in 2009 and another $200 million to $250 million in 2010. NCR, with a $1.6 billion market capitalization, previously disclosed that 66% of its $3.4 billion in U.S. pension assets were in equities at the end of 2007. The pension headache is hitting companies already under huge pressure to cut costs. Caterpillar recently announced 20,000 job cuts and warned that it may post its first quarterly loss since 1992. Caterpillar's U.S. pension had $10.4 billion in assets at the end of 2007 -- $700 million less than its obligations. Caterpillar's pension assets likely shrank by about $2.8 billion last year, assuming the 70% of its portfolio dedicated to equities fell 40% and, generously, the 25% invested in debt rose 5%. The company says it will contribute close to $1 billion to its pension this year. But that could still leave a hole of as much as $2.5 billion. Others might follow suit. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber had U.S. pension assets worth $4.5 billion at the end of 2007, when liabilities totaled $5.1 billion. With 68% of its portfolio in equities and the rest in debt, Goodyear's portfolio may have lost $1.1 billion last year. The company, with a market value of $1.7 billion, plans to announce its earnings Feb. 18. Some are postponing the reckoning. Under the Pension Protection Act, companies only need to show progress toward closing their deficits over a seven-year period -- so they don't need to start injecting cash immediately. If there was a sudden turnaround in the economy and equity markets, high-deficit companies would get a double boost. But the last large pension deficit in 2002 was less than half as large, and still took five years of healthy markets to correct. Investors should assume that deficits will soak up large amounts of hard cash for years to come.
