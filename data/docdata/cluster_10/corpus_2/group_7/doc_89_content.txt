As everyone looks to Pappa Gov to solve all our problems, here's an interesting question... Is the Fed Reserve "too big to fail"?? Fed looks like one more shaky bank After gobbling up the questionable collateral of the financial giants, the central bank's vaults are filled with paper assets that likely aren't worth what they once were. Citigroup (C, news, msgs) is too big to fail. American International Group (AIG, news, msgs) is too big to fail. So is Bank of America (BAC, news, msgs). If $25 billion is not enough, shovel in $20 billion more in taxpayer money. Still not enough? Guarantee that taxpayers will pick up the tab for losses on $100 billion, $200 billion, $300 billion in shaky assets. There's no choice, right? Keep shoveling the cash into the black hole, because if we stop, the whole U.S. economy -- wait, make that the whole global economy -- will fall into disaster. But how about the Federal Reserve, the key conduit for so many of these taxpayer billions? Is it too big to fail? Bet you've never even thought about that question. Or what it means to anyone who lives in the United States. But you should. http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/JubaksJournal/fed-looks-like-another-shaky-bank.aspx
