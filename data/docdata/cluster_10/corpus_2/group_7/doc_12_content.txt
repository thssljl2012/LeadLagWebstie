 Goldman Sachs in a report Tuesday ranked banks by a measure called the "Texas Ratio," a comparison of bad loans to capital. The ratio was used in the 1980s and 1990s to help predict bank failures. All of the banks Goldman Sachs listed were below the 100 percent danger zone. Bank of America was No. 7 on the list with a ratio of 38 percent. The worst was Ohio-based Huntington Bancshares at 66 percent. _________________ Today is the Tomorrow you worried about Yesterday!
