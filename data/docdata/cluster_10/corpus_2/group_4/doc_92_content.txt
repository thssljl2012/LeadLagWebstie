It&amp;#039;s a risk I am willing to take and now that we&amp;#039;ve reached this level, the longer this fear and uncertainty lasts the better it is for me.                       Same goes for me. There&amp;#039;s pretty much no doubt (in my mind) that this is a short term crisis and in 5yrs time I&amp;#039;ll look back and see that fantastic prices available currently on soild blue chip stocks.      Is the market on the verge of recovery yet - doubt it. Could the blue chips fall further - probably. But since I don&amp;#039;t know what&amp;#039;s going to happen to their price exactly, I&amp;#039;m happy to continue loading up whilst they&amp;#039;re below the cost of funds.       For example I bought some CBA this week. Will that have further writedowns of bad debt - almost certainly. But it&amp;#039;ll still be a much bigger better stronger bank in 5yrs time, and that&amp;#039;s all I care about. I do appreciate different investors have different time frames. Ok it might slide to $30, but with small position I take relative to my assets, it can&amp;#039;t hurt me (I don&amp;#039;t plan on selling and I&amp;#039;m not subject to margin calls), plus I get to buy more at the lower price and the whole time the dividend keeps getting better.      Some may think this is foolish, but I honestly don&amp;#039;t think CBA will be anything other than a stronger, bigger company in 5yrs whose dividends have increased far beyond what they are today. In the end, that&amp;#039;s the only reason I&amp;#039;m buying into the market. Could have saved a few months and 10% price slide? Oh well.
