 If you are a Barclays shareholder, worth a look.     http://boards.fool.co.uk/Messages.asp?bid=50190     &amp;#039;Just to make us all feel even worse and by comparison I understand that if Lloyds pay their government prefs back within 6 months they will only pay a 1% premium and even if they don&amp;#039;t manage that they can pay the prefs back any time they are able. I presume they could achieve that with a swift post merger disposal. This makes our 14% fixed for 11 years look catastrophic.&amp;#039;      &amp;#039;Why don&amp;#039;t the smaller shareholders (myself included) demand an extraordinary general meeting on a Vote of No Confidence in the board. If sufficient swell can be created it might, just might, make the board take the interests of their shareholders more seriously.&amp;#039;
