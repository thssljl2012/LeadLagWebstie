          I personally won&amp;#039;t touch a bank, REIT and few insurers at this moment. But I&amp;#039;m passing this on as I know there are people on this board looking over banks to snap up on the cheap    http://online.barrons.com/article/SB122549956508489915.html?...   INVESTORS ARE WRESTLING WITH BANK stocks because many look richly priced, based on depressed 2009 earnings estimates. The bulls expect a strong 2010 and 2011. &amp;amp;quot;During the past two credit cycles, bank stocks bottomed a full year before credit losses peaked,&amp;amp;quot; says Barclays Capital banking analyst Jason Goldberg, who likes the sector. For instance, in late 1990, they bottomed about a year before credit losses peaked. Investors are afraid that if they wait until credit turns in 2009 or 2010, the stocks will already have rallied.  While the elite of PNC, Wells Fargo, US Bancorp and JPMorgan have done well, there appear to be better values in the financial sector, including regionals like Fifth Third (FITB), Marshall &amp;amp;amp; Ilsley (MI), KeyCorp (KEY) and Synovus (SNV). Outside banking, battered life insurers beckon, including Prudential Financial (PRU) and MetLife (MET), both of which trade below book value. While insurers are exposed to weak markets through huge investment portfolios, they don&amp;#039;t have banks&amp;#039; leverage -- or risks.  Property-and-casualty insurance stocks got a lift recently amid expectations of an end to the slide in commercial premiums. Yet, Allstate (ALL) and The Travelers Companies (TRV) still trade at or under book value, while two of the strongest insurers, Ace (ACE) and Chubb (CB), trade at modest premiums to book and at less than 10 times projected 2009 profits. Depressed asset managers like Franklin Resources (BEN) and AllianceBernstein (AB) trade for 10 to 15 times projected 2009 profits.
