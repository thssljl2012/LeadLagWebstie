      Quote:                          Armegeddon is priced in.                        quote of the year      Markets should reach their low before the actual economy does if they are still able to accurately gauge the damage.      Main thing is to break the downward spiral, so long as hedge funds or someone big still needs more money they&amp;#039;ll be selling and value wont matter.        The barclays funding should be seen as pretty good news even if the shares tanked anyway, one to watch.  Hbos is selling more assets possibly, any news like that means alot I think
