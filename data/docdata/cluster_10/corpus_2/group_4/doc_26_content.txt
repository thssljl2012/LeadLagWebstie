         The reasoning of those buying the protection especially if you are a pension fund or trustee with a fiduciary responsibility:  Who ever thought AIG, the world&amp;#039;s largest insurance co, could go bust writing unregulated derivatives contracts? BRK is also writing derivative contracts and has already suffered massive losses. If it could happen to AIG.....  So why not CYA and buy the CDS insurance?
