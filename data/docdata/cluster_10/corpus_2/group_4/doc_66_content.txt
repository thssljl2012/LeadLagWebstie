 DCTH Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              1.9+ million shares dumped by 4 funds so far in November    http://www.mffais.com/dcth.html     Winslow Management Company Llc          11/14/2008           Sold All -682,000  Straus Capital Management Llc                 11/14/2008          Sold Some -551,401  Citadel L P                                               11/14/2008          Sold Some -39,784  Barclays Global Investors Uk Holdings Ltd  11/12/2008          Sold Some -650,508      The worst part is the remaining 3 funds still hold a combined 1,568,316 shares. Maybe Delcath should look at an orderly buyout of these shares. It&amp;#039;s either that or we could hit the .50 level or worse IMHO.    Flying Tarpon&amp;#039;s continued positive posting seems to further exacerbate this meltdown and he&amp;#039;s certainly reinforcing my thesis from September. Plot his post dates on the daily price chart and watch the correlation. (+ post) = (- PPS)
