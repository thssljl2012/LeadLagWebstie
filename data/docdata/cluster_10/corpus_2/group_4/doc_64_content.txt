SHUFFLING ECONOMIC DECK CHAIRS ON THE SS TITANIC    Now its official: the US Treasury wont buy up toxic debt after all.  Buying up bad debt was the entire rationale used to convince Congress  to bailout Wall Street and the big investment banks. Without it,  Paulson and Bernanke proclaimed, the US economy would likely  collapse. Paulson even went so far at the time to say that it  wouldnt do any good to inject liquidity directly into banks if these  bad debts werent secured first. But, thats exactly what he did after  Congress gave him carte blanche powershe loaded nine insider banks  with additional billions so they would be in a position to buy up  other troubled banks. Then Paulson bailed out the money market funds  (funneling the money through JP Morgan), and added another $40B  injection to insurance giant AIG (on top of $110B), which allowed it  to keep paying out on its derivative losses for credit default swaps  (promises without backing to insure debt against default). Congress  kept waiting for the bad debt buyout but it never came. Neither did  the promised oversightspecific reports to Congress mapping out where  the money went and to whom. A few in Congress are demanding an  accounting, but the Fed is refusing to answer. The US treasury has  already spent $3.45 trillion on the bailoutnot $700B as the public  believesand the end is nowhere in sight. Its time for some answers  before acquiescing to Paulsons plea to trust me again.
