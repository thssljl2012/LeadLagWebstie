         Seems to me the Arab infusion is a good deal.  I can&amp;#039;t believe they have invested without executing due diligence and checking the books for toxic assets, particularly after their earlier investments have fallen so much. Dividends will be resumed in 2009, much earlier that the other three UK banks. Cost is lower given the rate paid to the investors is tax deductible vs the other three banks&amp;#039; cost is not. And what about being a &amp;#039;preferred&amp;#039; bank for a lot of Mid East deals? Might not be openly expressed but it has to happen - keep our investment alive and well.   Still perhaps I&amp;#039;m being naive, the market certainly didn&amp;#039;t share my optimism but perhaps next week....?  Z
