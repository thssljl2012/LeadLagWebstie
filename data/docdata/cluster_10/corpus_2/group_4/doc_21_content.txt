         Dave,  &amp;amp;quot; Agreed elem, I can&amp;#039;t understand people who tell themselves that a paper loss is not a loss, imv, it is a loss and calling it a paper loss is just ducking the reality that the shares you bought are not worth what you paid for them any more. &amp;amp;quot;   &amp;#039; In that case you make a loss every time you buy shares - stamp duty and the transaction costs mean that at that particular instant you have lost money. &amp;amp;quot;  Agreed, and there&amp;#039;s also the bid/offer spread to consider as well.    &amp;amp;quot; But you buy in the expectation that that paper loss will be reversed either fairly quickly if you are trading or later if you are a longer term investor. If I thought Barclays was about to go bankrupt then yes I&amp;#039;d sell and take the loss but I don&amp;#039;t think that appears likely at the moment. Also if I thought the share price wouldn&amp;#039;t recover for twenty years then I&amp;#039;d cut my losses but as you can see from my name I&amp;#039;m only a minor bear with a bit of bull thrown in. :) &amp;amp;quot;   That may be so, but a side issue to the side issue we were on*, namely, what is a loss.  Anyhoo, I&amp;#039;ve given my little speech so as to not disrupt the board from agonising over Barclays recent business, I&amp;#039;ll leave it there.  Have a great weekend.  awbMaven  * - ;-)
