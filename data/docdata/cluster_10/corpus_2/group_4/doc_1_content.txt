Quote:                         Gentlemen   Some of you have expressed interest in understanding more of what is going on with the worlds credit crisis / crisis of confidence. What follows is a thought provoking article, whether you understand it fully and/or agree with it or not (I suggest you print it out). While it is by no means an exhaustive description, and you might also have to read it a couple of times to understand it, I have circulated it because it encapsulates many of the western worlds present banking problems in brevity (whether the thesis is correct or not). For those of you whom this is of interest to, hopefully it will be thought provoking. If so, I can share other elements of the problem with you, even thought I dont pretend to understand it all.   But first, a couple of key concepts:      Basel I and Basel II   Basel I was written in 1988 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which recommends certain standards and regulations for banks. The main recommendation of this document is that in order to lower credit risk, banks should hold enough capital to equal at least 8% of its risk-weighted assets. Most countries have implemented some version of this regulation.   Basel II was written in 2004 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and makes more detailed recommendations for banks, building on the previous Basel I document. Basel II includes recommendations on three main areas: risks, supervisory review, and market discipline. Many countries and banks have started implementing the guidelines set out in Basel II, although it may take as long as the year 2015 for full implementation.   Critically, under Basel I residential mortgages carried a blanket 50% risk weighting. Under Basel II, banks can set their own risk weightings based on the history of defaults in their own mortgage books. Some argue that the impending change to Basel II was a factor in the sharp growth in mortgage lending globally over the last 4  5 years, which in turn was a factor that boosted house prices globally into what many saw as a bubble situation.   In New Zealand for example, ANZ National has set its average risk weighting under Basel II at 26% (the lowest of the NZ banks). With its mortgage book at NZD $49.1 billion at 31 March 2008, this means its capital requirements to cover 8% of risk weighted assets have fallen from $49.1b*50%*8% = $1.96b under Basel I to $49.1b*26%*8% = $1.02b. You can see as a proportion of total mortgages, the banks capital backing has the scope to fall from roughly 4% to 2% (not dissimilar to the US banks  but thats another story).      Credit Default Swap    A credit default swap is a specific kind of counterparty agreement which allows the transfer of third party credit risk from one party to the other. One party in the swap is a lender and faces credit risk from a third party, and the counterparty in the credit default swap agrees to insure this risk in exchange of regular periodic payments (essentially an insurance premium). If the third party defaults, the party providing insurance will have to purchase from the insured party the defaulted asset. In turn, the insurer pays the insured the remaining interest on the debt, as well as the principal.      How AIG&amp;#039;s Collapse Began a Global Run on the Banks    By Porter Stansberry   October 4, 2008    Something very strange is happening in the financial markets. And I can show you what it is and what it means...    If September didn&amp;#039;t give you enough to worry about, consider what will happen to real estate prices as unemployment grows steadily over the next several months. As bad as things are now, they&amp;#039;ll get much worse.    They&amp;#039;ll get worse for the obvious reason: because more people will default on their mortgages. But they&amp;#039;ll also remain depressed for far longer than anyone expects, for a reason most people will never understand.    What follows is one of the real secrets to September&amp;#039;s stock market collapse. Once you understand what really happened last month, the events to come will be much clearer to you...    Every great bull market has similar characteristics. The speculation must  at the beginning  start with a reasonably good idea. Using long-term mortgages to pay for homes is a good idea, with a few important caveats.    Some of these limitations are obvious to any intelligent observer... like the need for a substantial down payment, the verification of income, an independent appraisal, etc. But human nature dictates that, given enough time and the right incentives, any endeavour will be corrupted. This is one of the two critical elements of a bubble. What was once a good idea becomes a farce. You already know all the stories of how this happened in the housing market, where loans were eventually given without fixed rates, without income verification, without down payments, and without legitimate appraisals.    As bad as these practices were, they would not have created a global financial panic without the second, more critical element. For things to get really out of control, the farce must evolve further... into fraud.    And this is where AIG comes into the story.    Around the world, banks must comply with what are known as Basel II regulations. These regulations determine how much capital a bank must maintain in reserve. The rules are based on the quality of the bank&amp;#039;s loan book. The riskier the loans a bank owns, the more capital it must keep in reserve. Bank managers naturally seek to employ as much leverage as they can, especially when interest rates are low, to maximize profits. AIG appeared to offer banks a way to get around the Basel rules, via unregulated insurance contracts, known as credit default swaps.    Here&amp;#039;s how it worked: Say you&amp;#039;re a major European bank... You have a surplus of deposits, because in Europe people actually still bother to save money. You&amp;#039;re looking for something to maximize the spread between what you must pay for deposits and what you&amp;#039;re able to earn lending. You want it to be safe and reliable, but also pay the highest possible annual interest. You know you could buy a portfolio of high-yielding subprime mortgages. But doing so will limit the amount of leverage you can employ, which will limit returns.    So rather than rule out having any high-yielding securities in your portfolio, you simply call up the friendly AIG broker you met at a conference in London last year.    &amp;amp;quot;What would it cost me to insure this subprime security?&amp;amp;quot; you inquire. The broker, who is selling a five-year policy (but who will be paid a bonus annually), says, &amp;amp;quot;Not too much.&amp;amp;quot; After all, the historical loss rate on American mortgages is close to zilch.    Using incredibly sophisticated computer models, he agrees to guarantee the subprime security you&amp;#039;re buying against default for five years for say, 2% of face value.    Although AIG&amp;#039;s credit default swaps were really insurance contracts, they weren&amp;#039;t regulated. That meant AIG didn&amp;#039;t have to put up any capital as collateral on its swaps, as long as it maintained a triple-A credit rating. There was no real capital cost to selling these swaps; there was no limit. And thanks to what&amp;#039;s called &amp;amp;quot;mark-to-market&amp;amp;quot; accounting, AIG could book the profit from a five-year credit default swap as soon as the contract was sold, based on the expected default rate.    Whatever the computer said AIG was likely to make on the deal, the accountants would write down as actual profit. The broker who sold the swap would be paid a bonus at the end of the first year  long before the actual profit on the contract was made.    With this structure in place, the European bank was able to assure its regulators it was holding only triple-A credits, instead of a bunch of subprime &amp;amp;quot;toxic waste.&amp;amp;quot; The bank could leverage itself to the full extent allowable under Basel II. AIG could book hundreds of millions in &amp;amp;quot;profit&amp;amp;quot; each year, without having to pony up billions in collateral.    It was a fraud. AIG never any capital to back up the insurance it sold. And the profits it booked never materialized. The default rate on mortgage securities underwritten in 2005, 2006, and 2007 turned out to be multiples higher than expected. And they continue to increase. In some cases, the securities the banks claimed were triple A have ended up being worth less than $0.15 on the dollar.   Even so, it all worked for years. Banks leveraged deposits to the hilt. Wall Street packaged and sold dumb mortgages as securities. And AIG sold credit default swaps without bothering to collateralize the risk. An enormous amount of capital was created out of thin air and tossed into global real estate markets.    On September 15, all of the major credit-rating agencies downgraded AIG  the world&amp;#039;s largest insurance company. At issue were the soaring losses in its credit default swaps. The first big write-off came in the fourth quarter of 2007, when AIG reported an $11 billion charge. It was able to raise capital once, to repair the damage. But the losses kept growing. The moment the downgrade came; AIG was forced to come up with tens of billions of additional collateral, immediately. This was on top of the billions it owed to its trading partners. It didn&amp;#039;t have the money. The world&amp;#039;s largest insurance company was bankrupt.    The dominoes fell over immediately. Lehman Brothers failed on the same day. Merrill was sold to Bank of America. The Fed stepped in and agreed to lend AIG $85 billion to facilitate an orderly sell o...
