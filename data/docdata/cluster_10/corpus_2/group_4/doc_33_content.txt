Now consider  how  Wikipedia  describes a  Ponzi  scheme:             A&amp;amp;nbsp;Ponzi  scheme&amp;amp;nbsp;is  a  fraudulent  investment&amp;amp;nbsp;operation  that  involves  promising  or  paying  abnormally  high  returns  (profits)  to  investors  out of  the  money  paid in  by  subsequent  investors,  rather  than  from net  revenues  generated  by any  real  business.&amp;amp;nbsp;  It is  named  after&amp;amp;nbsp;Charles  Ponzi...One  reason  that the  scheme  initially  works so  well is  that  early  investors   those  who  actually  got paid  the  large  returns   quite  commonly  reinvest  (keep)  their  money in  the  scheme  (it  does,  after  all, pay  out much  better  than any  alternative  investment).  Thus  those  running  the  scheme  do not  actually  have to  pay out  very  much  (net)   they  simply  have to  send  statements  to  investors  that  show how  much the  investors  have  earned  by  keeping  the  money in  what  looks  like a  great  place to  get a  high  return.  They  also try  to  minimize  withdrawals  by  offering  new  plans to  investors,  often  where  money is  frozen  for a  longer  period  of  time...The  catch is  that at  some  point  one of  three  things  will  happen:              (1)&amp;amp;nbsp;the  promoters  will  vanish,  taking  all the  investment  money  (less  payouts)  with  them;              (2)&amp;amp;nbsp;the  scheme  will  collapse  of its  own  weight,  as  investment  slows  and the  promoters  start  having  problems  paying  out the  promised  returns  (and  when  they  start  having  problems,  the word  spreads  and more  people  start  asking  for  their  money,  similar  to  a&amp;amp;nbsp;bank  run);              (3) the  scheme  is  exposed,  because  when  legal  authorities  begin  examining  accounting  records  of the  so-called  enterprise  they  find  that  many of  the  &amp;#039;assets&amp;#039;  that  should  exist do  not.&amp;quot;                 Looking at  outcomes 1,  2, and 3  above,  heres where  we are  today.&amp;amp;nbsp; The  promoters  have clearly  not vanished  as in  outcome 1.&amp;amp;nbsp;  In fact,  they are  behaving as  if they know  they have  nothing to  fear.&amp;amp;nbsp; As  over $2  trillion of  taxpayer  money is  rapidly  infused  through  Federal  Reserve  loans and  over $125  Billion in  U.S.  Treasury  equity  purchases to  keep these  firms from  collapsing,  the  promoters  are standing  at the elbow  of the  President-Elect  in press  conferences  (Citigroup  promoter,  Robert  Rubin); they  are served  up as  business  gurus on the  business  channel CNBC  (former AIG  CEO and  promoter,  Maurice  Hank  Greenberg);  they are put  in charge of  nationalized  zombie firms  like Fannie  Mae (Herbert  Allison,  former  President of  Merrill  Lynch); they  are paying  $26 million  and $42  million,  respectively,  for new digs  at 15  Central Park  West in  Manhattan,  where their  chauffeurs  have their  own waiting  room (Lloyd  Blankfein,  CEO of  Goldman  Sachs;  Sanford  Sandy  Weill,  former CEO  of  Citigroup,  who put his  penthouse in  the name of  his wifes  trust,  perhaps  smelling a  few pesky  questions  ahead over  the $1  billion he  sucked out  of Citigroup  before the  Fed had to  implant a  feeding  tube).          We are  definitely  seeing all  the signs of  outcome 2:  the scheme  is  collapsing  under its  own weight;  there are  panic runs  around the  globe  wherever  Wall Street  has left its  footprint.&amp;amp;nbsp;            But outcome  3 is the  most  fascinating  area of  departure  from the  classic  Ponzi  scheme.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Legal  authorities  have,  indeed,  examined the  books of  these firms,  except for  one area  well  discuss  later.&amp;amp;nbsp; They  found  worthless  assets along  with debts  hidden off  the balance  sheet  instead of  real  depositor  funds.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Instead of  arresting  the  perpetrators  and shutting  down the  schemes,  Federal  authorities  have  developed  their own  new schemes  and pumped  over $2  trillion of  taxpayer  money into  propping up  the firms  while  leaving the  schemers in  place.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Equally  astonishing,  Congress has  not held any  meaningful  investigations.&amp;amp;nbsp;  This has  left many  Wall Street  veterans  wondering if  the problem  isnt that  the firms  are too big  to fail but  rather too  Ponzi-like  to  prosecute.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Imagine the  worldwide  reaction to  learning  that all the  claptrap  coming from  U.S.  think-tanks  and  ivy-league  academics  over the  last decade  about  efficient  market  theory and  deregulation  and trickle  down was  merely a  ruse for a  Ponzi scheme  now being  propped up  by a U.S.  Treasury  Department  bailout and  loans from  our central  bank, the  Federal  Reserve.          Fortunately  for American  taxpayers,  Bloomberg  News has  some  inquiring  minds, even  if our  Congress and  prosecutors  dont.&amp;amp;nbsp; On  May 20,  2008,  Bloomberg  News  reporter,  Mark  Pittman,  filed a  Freedom of  Information  Act request  (FOIA) with  the Federal  Reserve  asking for  detailed  information  relevant to  whom the  central bank  was giving  these  massive  loans and  precisely  what  securities  these firms  were posting  as  collateral.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Bloomberg  also wanted  details on  contracts  with outside  entities  that show  the  employees or  entities  being used  to price the  Relevant  Securities  and to  conduct the  process of  lending.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Heretofore,  our opaque  central bank  had been mum  on all  points.          By law, the  Federal  Reserve had  until June  18, 2008 to  answer the  FOIA  request.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Heres what  happened  instead,  according to  the  Bloomberg  lawsuit:&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  On June 19,  2008, the  Fed invoked  its right to  extend the  response  time to July  3, 2008.&amp;amp;nbsp; On  July 8,  2008, the  Fed called  Bloomberg  News to say  it was  processing  the  request.&amp;amp;nbsp;  The Fed rang  up Bloomberg  again on  August 15,  2008,  wherein  Alison Thro,  Senior  Counsel and  another  employee,  Pam Wilson,  informed the  business  wire service  that their  request was  going to be  denied by  the end of  September  2008.&amp;amp;nbsp; No  further  response of  any kind was  received,  including  the denial.&amp;amp;nbsp;  On November  7, 2008,  Bloomberg  News slapped  a federal  lawsuit on  the Board of  Governors of  the Federal  Reserve,  asserting  the  following:          The  government  documents  that  Bloomberg  seeks are  central to  understanding  and  assessing  the  governments  response to  the most  cataclysmic  financial  crisis in  America  since the  Great  Depression.&amp;amp;nbsp;  The effect  of that  crisis on  the American  public has  been and  will  continue to  be  devastating.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Hundreds of  corporations  are  announcing  layoffs in  response to  the crisis,  and the  economy was  the top  issue for  many  Americans in  the recent  elections.&amp;amp;nbsp;  In response  to the  crisis, the  Fed has  vastly  expanded its  lending  programs to  private  financial  institutions.&amp;amp;nbsp;  To obtain  access to  this public  money and to  safeguard  the  taxpayers  interests,  borrowers  are required  to post  collateral.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Despite the  manifest  public  interest in  such  matters,  however,  none of the  programs  themselves  make  reference to  any public  disclosure  of the  posted  collateral  or of the  Feds  methods in  valuing it.&amp;amp;nbsp;  Thus, while  the  taxpayers  are the  ultimate  counterparty  for the  collateral,  they have  not been  given any  information  regarding  the kind of  collateral  received,  how it was  valued, or  by whom.            As evidence  that  Bloomberg  News is not  engaging in  hyperbole  when it uses  the word  cataclysmic  in a Federal  court  filing,  consider the  following  price  movements of  some of  these giant  financial  institutions.&amp;amp;nbsp;  (All current  prices are  intraday on  November 12,  2008):             American  International  Group  (AIG):&amp;amp;nbsp;  Currently  $2.16;  in May&amp;amp;nbsp;  2007,  $72.00          Bear  Stearns:  Absorbed  into  JPMorganChase  to avoid  bankruptcy  filing;  share  price in  April  2007,  $159          Fannie  Mae:  Currently  65  cents;  in June  2007  $69.00          Freddie  Mac:  Currently  79  cents;  in May  2...
