         &amp;amp;quot;You mean, on their way to bankruptcy and oblivion, these frauds had record profits? &amp;amp;quot;  AIG is still making money hand over fist in the insurance business....  So are the other medium and smaller banks......  It was Fannie and Freddie who started and abetted the subprime mess, and it was Congress that systematically &amp;#039;urged&amp;#039; under force of law the lower ing of lending standards....  And it took 2 to tango...for every derivative product sold, it took a willing buyer.  So far, no one has been accused of &amp;#039;fraud&amp;#039; in the CDO/SIV market......  By the way, Merrill Lynch went bust....as should some other banks and investment houses... but some of them got swallowed up....which is the way it should happen.....and likely will.  The investment companies have been profitable for 100 years......  GM Hasn&amp;#039;t made a dime making cars for 30 years...and never will at the current rate......and current legacy costs....  t.
