Here&amp;#039;s a country that the yield is over 80% if you want to buy their debt, because no one thinks it has a chance of being repaid...one option is this country could go into default.&amp;amp;nbsp; If that happens, the countries currency is worth zip/zero/nada.    &amp;amp;nbsp;       By Lester Pimentel and Daniel Cancel    Nov. 14 (Bloomberg) -- Ecuador will miss a $30 million interest payment due tomorrow, opting to use the 30-day grace period to decide whether to honor the debt as a tumble in oil prices erodes the South American country&amp;#039;s revenue.     The price on the 12 percent bonds maturing in 2012 plunged to as low as 14 cents on the dollar, sending yields over 100 percent, as investors braced for the first sovereign default since the global financial crisis deepened in September. Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s cut the country&amp;#039;s rating three levels today to CCC-.     President    Rafael Correa   , who has threatened to default on debt he deems ``illegitimate&amp;#039;&amp;#039; since the 2006 campaign, is waiting on legal opinions before determining how to proceed with the payment on the $510 million bond, Finance Minister    Maria Elsa Viteri    said at a news conference in Quito.     ``It&amp;#039;s up to the president to analyze the alternatives,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Viteri said. ``All options are on the table.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;     Ecuador&amp;#039;s finances have come under strain as oil, which accounts for 60 percent of the country&amp;#039;s exports, has plunged 61 percent from a record high in July to $57.23 a barrel.     Ecuador, which last defaulted in 1999, needs an oil price of $95 to cover all the spending in its budget and a price of $76 to avoid depleting its $6.3 billion of foreign reserves, according to Barclays Capital Inc.     ``They are burning reserves,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Eduardo Levy-Yeyati, an emerging-markets analyst at Barclays. ``The question is whether they will keep paying if oil prices don&amp;#039;t recover.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;     Debt Fraud     Correa, a 45-year-old economist who laces his speeches with phrases in the native Quechua language, said on Sept. 29 that his government may not pay debt deemed ``illegitimate&amp;#039;&amp;#039; by an auditing committee. Earlier that month, he called the committee&amp;#039;s preliminary findings ``harrowing,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; saying some of the debt was fraudulently contracted.     Ecuador&amp;#039;s foreign debt totaled $10 billion as of September, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. That&amp;#039;s equal to less than 25 percent of its $44 billion annual gross domestic product.     Correa, who earned his Ph.D. at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, won a landslide victory in November 2006 after promising to rewrite the constitution and boost spending on the poor. He said in September that he&amp;#039;d suspend debt payments before trimming spending on education and health care.     ``The willingness to pay is obviously not there,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said    Alberto Bernal   , an emerging-markets strategist for Bulltick Capital Markets in Miami.     `Extreme&amp;#039; Move     While the drop in oil has crimped revenue, the government still has enough money to service its debt, Bernal said. Viteri said at the news conference that the government has the cash to make the $30 million payment on time.     ``The government still has liquidity,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Bernal said. ``Not paying $30 million sounds extreme. It&amp;#039;s too early to kick the table.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;     The yield on the 2012 bonds, which were issued as part of a restructuring in 2000, surged 13.29 percentage points to 82.79 percent at 2:20 p.m. in New York, according to JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp;amp; Co. The yield climbed to as high as 108 percent earlier today.     The bonds&amp;#039; price sank 5 cents on the dollar to 20 cents after plunging 17 cents yesterday. The bond traded at 99.5 cents on Sept. 8, a week before the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. deepened the global economic slump that has throttled demand for crude oil.             thread start
