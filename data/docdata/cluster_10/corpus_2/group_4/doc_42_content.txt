I do not know how long it will take for investors to wake up to the reality that things are now out of control. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that most calculators do not go up to the trillion mark, but most Americans are truly oblivious to what is going on around them. It seems as if they believe that some sort of divine intervention will fend off the inevitable. In three separate plans the Treasury is spending US $700 billion, while the Fed is spending US $1.4 trillion, and no one seems to question where this money is coming from. Just as a piece of general information, the Fed does not have US $1.4 trillion to spend, but why let a little detail like that hold you back.      The Fed can cut rates again, and I am sure they will. Both the Fed and Paulson can print money until hell freezes over, and it seems like they are, but it will not solve the problem. The problem is that the United States sold almost US $500 trillion in derivatives to the rest of the world, and there is little or nothing to back that up.      With $12 trillion in debt most of it owed to Foreigners, We are also facing $60 + Trillion in entitlements and two Presidential Candidates promising even more spending, we are at war on two fronts and the American people are in deeper debt as a percentage of their income than they have ever been.            Hang on to your physical,  it is just a matter of waiting .    Like most of you I am not counting on anything paper that I have bought.    Sooner or later there will be a bolt to the gold door, more sooner than later IMHO.       Anyone selling their physical now,  either silver or gold needs to have their head examined. Either gold will prevail or all economic rules will have been canceled.       Does no one else find it incredible that with the miners at these prices that there has been no mergers or takeovers?            Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Gold is for rich guys -- buying physical gold, that is. The metal&amp;#039;s highest and best investment use is as insurance policy against a currency collapse. For that purpose, you need a lot of it, stored around the world. Owning 20 or 30 coins is nice but won&amp;#039;t protect your standard of living in a world where dollars are dust.       Gold isn&amp;#039;t even a reliable hedge against inflation. It reached $850 an ounce in January 1980, a price not seen again until January 2008. During those intervening 28 years, gold plunged and reared but lost more than half of its purchasing power. For a 1980 investor to break even after inflation, gold would have to reach $2,200.       It might, but how long did you plan to wait?       For the average investor, gold boils down to a speculation on higher prices. The latest run-up started in August 2007, when the housing market visibly started falling apart. From $652, it raced up to $1,003 an ounce last March, zig-zagged back to $747 in September, jumped to $905, then slid to $772 as of yesterday.       Hedge funds drove the market but individuals jumped in, too. So far this year, investors have purchased 611,000 newly minted, one-ounce U.S. gold coins, compared with 315,000 in all of 2007.       ``We&amp;#039;ve seen a switch in appetite, with investors moving from futures to physical gold, either owning it directly or going through exchange-traded funds,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; says Suki Cooper, an analyst at London-based Barclays Capital.       Coins purchased strictly for their gold value, not their numismatic value, are known as bullion coins. Many countries mint them -- South Africa (Krugerrand), Canada (Maple Leaf), China (Panda), Austria (Philharmonic) and Australia (Kangaroo), among others. The U.S. Mint makes Buffalos and American Eagles. For investment purposes, you want the one-ounce size.       Supply Shrinks       That is, if you can find them. The yearlong run on bullion has dried up the supply of coins for immediate delivery. Everything was out of stock last week at the online dealer onlygold.com
