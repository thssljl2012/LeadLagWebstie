         No one can be sure where is the bottom and how long the market will stay there. But I&amp;#039;m sure that BH will be much better off with this market turmoil than without it. On insurance, BH will have less competition because competitors like AIG are in big trouble and can command higher premium. On investment, WEB can buy lots of $1 for 50-80 cents (despite stock price halved, I think the warrants on GE and GS still worth a lot of money). And looking at the operating business earnings from last Q, they stand the storm very well and will emerge stronger as well. Just this market turmoil will increase BRK intrinsic value by 10-20%.
