          Selling will just crystallize a loss.   yes, but a loss is a loss, if you continue to hold it must be because you believe there will be a recovery   Buying more seems idiotic - the deal seems to be worse than that for those who took up the government offer.   I dont think that&amp;#039;s true, the rate is better on the government offer, but the quantity of shares would have been substantially higher. 7bn is what Lloyds require, Barclays would have been closer to RBS by the governments definitions.   Hence holding but not committing any more money seems the best option.   Perhaps, but some us us are new to Barclays and looking to see if it&amp;#039;s worthwhile joining in :-)
