 SPNC Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0               Institutional Holdings: Old 13f Friends are Back...       jmso, not investment advice. do your own work and draw your own conclusions if any of my comments matter to you.    The September 13f filings are a delight for longs.    Arbor bailed out entirely (again --shoo fly), and fido sold out 503k shares. Good riddance.    But check out the longs coming back to the shares and or adding seriously after the September 5th news and then spending some time with mgmt to get comfortable the downside isn&amp;#039;t zero.    We already talked about WFC&amp;#039;s 13g last week which reflected an add of ~1.5m shares (more than the 1.05m reflected a/o the 9/30/08 cutoff. Barclays and ING also added, making it such that 3 of the top 5 did so.    On page two of the listing (the next 20 institutional owners), 15 of 20 added or put on new positions, and each firm on the page holds at least 100k shares. A few favorites include Deefield&amp;#039;s timely return (905k new); Diamondback returning (465l new); Samlyn Capital, a new name I think (270k new); and Goldman, who just fired their analyst (now 373k after adding 178k).    Other color is that between holders number 6-17, 9 of those eleven came on new or added.    Just a hunch, but i suspect after &amp;quot;doing the work&amp;quot; and talking to mgmt, they all decided SPNC wasn&amp;#039;t going bkr after all (if not apparent, i&amp;#039;m joking as spnc has no debt).    nice...
