The biggest problem with Canadian Shareowner is that you have to buy their prescreened stocks and ETFs. This wouldn&amp;#039;t be a problem for if they allowed me to purchase  Vanguard&amp;#039;s ETFs rather than Baclay&amp;#039;s iShares. The only difference between the ETFs offered by Vanguard and Barclays is that the fees charged by Vanguard are much lower then the fees charged by Barclays.                      Interesting.  Your post more or less confirms what I was thinking--although I&amp;#039;m not at the 100k level yet...      Anyone else have any comments or experiences?
