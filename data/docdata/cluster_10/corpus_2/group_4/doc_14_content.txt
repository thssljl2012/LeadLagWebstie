 Oh dear. Yet another RED sunrise in the Land of Oz.....    Japan finally capitulates and announces &amp;amp;quot;R&amp;amp;quot; word.    Not unsurprisingly following that auspicious announcement,     Our financials today - hammered (CBA now almost down to $30! graph looks a tad nasty)  Our materials today - hammered  Our ... almost everything - hammered      All Ords 3,500 coming right up (down to 3615 ATM)? Is that a triple crown Bull Trap from mid-Oct to mid Nov?
