           US government rescues Citigroup The US government has agreed an eye-watering rescue package for Citigroup that will see it backstop $306bn (207bn) of the Wall Street bank&amp;amp;#8217;s problem assets and inject $20bn of capital.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/3511317/US-government-rescues-Citigroup-financial-crisis.html   By Jonathan Sibun and Amy Wilson Last Updated: 5:53PM GMT 24 Nov 2008   The latest move by the US Treasury to help its ailing financial sector comes after Citigroup&amp;amp;#8217;s share price fell 60pc last week as fears grew over its future.   The terms of the agreement - announced just before midnight on Sunday in the US - will see Citigroup absorb the first $29bn of losses it sustains on mortgages, loans and other problem assets. The Treasury will stand behind 90pc of any further losses up to $277bn, with Citigroup absorbing the balance.   In return for the capital injection and guarantees, the Government will receive $27bn of preferred shares in the bank, paying an 8pc dividend.   The latest government intervention - which follows moves to save insurance giant AIG and mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - is focused on bolstering stability in financial markets and helping to restore economic growth, the The Treasury, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said in a joint statement.   The preferred stock will come with warrants to allow the Treasury to buy up to 254m Citigroup shares at $10.61 each, allowing taxpayers to profit if the bank&amp;amp;#8217;s stock rallies following the government&amp;amp;#8217;s investment.   Citigroup will also be forced to cut its quarterly dividend to just 1 cent a share for the next three years, down from the 16 cents it paid last quarter.   The moves will give Citigroup $40bn of capital relief via the $20bn injection, $3.5bn of recognised capital via the preferred stock issue and a further $16bn of relief from the $306bn asset guarantee.   The bank said the latest injection - which follows a $25bn issue of preferred stock to the government last month - would leave it with a tier one ratio of 14.8pc.   Compensation for Citigroup chief executive Vikram Pandit and other top managers will also be overseen by the government with any rewards for long term performance or bonuses submitted to the Treasury for approval.   &amp;amp;#8220;This weekend, the US government and Citi worked together in an unprecedented way to address market confidence and the recent decline in Citi&amp;amp;#8217;s stock price,&amp;amp;#8221; said Mr Pandit. &amp;amp;#8220;We reached an agreement based on an innovative market solution to further strengthen our capital ratios, reduce risk, and increase liquidity. We appreciate the tremendous effort by the government to assure market stability.&amp;amp;#8221;   The intervention - which follows talks between bank officials, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke over the weekend - came amid mounting concern that the share price decline could prompt a run on the bank, which has $2 trillion of assets and operations in more than 100 countries.   Citigroup was understood to have approached its existing sovereign wealth fund shareholders from the Middle East and Asia to gauge their appetite for buying additional stakes in the bank.   Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit told staff last week there were no plans to break up the company, and also ruled out the sale of the Smith Barney brokerage unit. The bank did announce plans to cut a further 52,000 jobs globally and also said it would take about $80bn of so-called toxic assets onto its balance sheet.
