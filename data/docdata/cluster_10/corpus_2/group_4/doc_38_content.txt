And guess what?                                that news came on september 18th and it was kraft replacing AIG in the DJIA. That was because of foreclosures in the housing market starting to erode AIG&amp;#039;s MBS insurance earnings.     Not to mention after the down tick, the DJIA rallied and broke its previous resistance level to end at 11388.     The news which caused Stock Futures to decline was the proposal of a bailout on October 2nd.    The actual complete trend reversal of the DJIA came on October 12th of 2007 when the DJIA peaked at 14093.
