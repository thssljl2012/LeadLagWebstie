          You would hope that Barclays become the bank of choice for businesses in the middle east from now on...a high tarrif but worth it?   I remember years ago we tried to build a presence there and very much like our experiences in the US it all came to a sticky end. Of course there was a different mentality then amongst middle east borrowers; &amp;#039;what you mean we have to repay the debt&amp;#039;.  There was a bit in the paper today that made me sit up. In effect two investors have been allowed to build a near 30% stake in a major UK bank without paying any sort of premium.
