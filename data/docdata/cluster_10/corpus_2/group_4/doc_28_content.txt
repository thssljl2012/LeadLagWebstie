 FNM Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Citigroup Chief Pandit to Reduce Headcount by 50,000     By Zachary R. Mider and Bradley Keoun                       Nov. 17 (Bloomberg) --    Citigroup Inc.   , the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by market value, plans to eliminate more than 50,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of the workforce, and cut expenses by 20 percent from their peak as the global economy contracts.     Chief Executive Officer    Vikram Pandit    already reduced headcount this year by 23,000 through job cuts and the sale of business units, leaving the New York-based bank with 352,000 employees as of Sept. 30. The company intends to winnow that down to about 300,000 in the ``near term,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; according to a    presentation    on the firm&amp;#039;s Web site. Pandit, 51, was scheduled to announce the plan to employees today.      Annual expenses will fall to about $50 billion in 2009, according to the presentation. Expenses in the past four quarters totaled $62 billion.      ``Continued asset and expense reductions, while positive, are indicative that the operating environment has been and is expected to continue to be challenging,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Barclays Capital analyst    Jason Goldberg    said today in a report.     Citigroup slumped 19 percent in New York    trading    last week and is down 69 percent this year, after four straight quarterly losses totaling $20 billion. The shares declined 35 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $9.17 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at 9:44 a.m.      Banks and brokerages worldwide have shed almost 160,000 jobs since the subprime mortgage market&amp;#039;s collapse last year sparked a credit crisis.      &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;              Depression: Unemployed: Typical picture capturing the number of people who were unemployed and looking for a job.
