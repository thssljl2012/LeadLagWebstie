Lehman Hasn&amp;#039;t Tapped The Discount Window  Posted by John Carney, Sep 11, 2008, 4:33pm    Whatever else is going wrong at Lehman Brothers,  the firm hasn&amp;#039;t had to tap the  Fed &amp;#039;s primary dealer credit facility.  A few moments ago the  Fed  released the latest numbers showing that the discount window for investment banks hasn&amp;#039;t had any drawings at all. This news was somewhat telegraphed by the successful commercial paper offering from Lehman earlier today.     Commercial banks, on the other hand, are borrowing heavily from the discount window.      Update:   There has been some speculation that Lehman cannot tap the discount window, either because it lacks adequate collateral or because the  Fed  has deemed that it is no longer eligible because it is not an ongoing concern. Our sources tell us that this is flatly wrong. The  Fed  takes a wide variety of collateral, which it values at prices far higher than the going rates in the markets. Lehman has plenty of junk in its trunk to trade for  Fed  ducets. And the &amp;amp;quot;going concern&amp;amp;quot; thing just hasn&amp;#039;t come up and its highly unlikely that the  Fed  will turn off this money spigot on that basis.    -----------------------------------------------      Bank of America In Preliminary Talks For Lehman  Bid   Posted by John Carney, Sep 11, 2008, 4:10pm    We&amp;#039;ve known for most of the day that Lehman Brother has been actively shopping itself in a desperate attempt to avoid catastrophe. Now names of potential buyers are starting to come in.   The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Bank of America is in talks with Lehman.     Perhaps most interesting is the Journal&amp;#039;s reporting on who isn&amp;#039;t participating.  Up until just a few minutes ago we were hearing rumors that HSBC could  put  in a  bid  over night, despite earlier denials from the bank. Now the Journal says no  bid  is expected from HSBC. Others who aren&amp;#039;t &amp;amp;quot;expected to participate&amp;amp;quot; include Goldman Sachs, France&amp;#039;s BNP Paribas, Germany&amp;#039;s Deutsche Bank, and Spain&amp;#039;s Banco Santander. Barclays is a maybe.         http://www.dealbreaker.com/
