          Agreed elem, I can&amp;#039;t understand people who tell themselves that a paper loss is not a loss, imv, it is a loss and calling it a paper loss is just ducking the reality that the shares you bought are not worth what you paid for them any more.    In that case you make a loss every time you buy shares - stamp duty and the transaction costs mean that at that particular instant you have lost money. But you buy in the expectation that that paper loss will be reversed either fairly quickly if you are trading or later if you are a longer term investor. If I thought Barclays was about to go bankrupt then yes I&amp;#039;d sell and take the loss but I don&amp;#039;t think that appears likely at the moment. Also if I thought the share price wouldn&amp;#039;t recover for twenty years then I&amp;#039;d cut my losses but as you can see from my name I&amp;#039;m only a minor bear with a bit of bull thrown in. :)  Dave
