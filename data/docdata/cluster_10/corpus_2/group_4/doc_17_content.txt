 I think DCA  gets a bad name through misuse rather than being a bad trading vehicle .       If used wisely, it can actually take a bit of heat out of a trade by :-   a) Lowering the initial potential loss via position sizing   b) Takes the pressure off those whos Technical Analysis is ok, but not great, by making the Entry a little less critical.       The main problems I see, are those using averaging down probably dont have any entry and exit criteria.      An Investor might try something like the following . Obviously a Trader would have a slightly different approach (Mainly shorter Time Frames)      1) Each lot purchased should be no more than 2% of Trading Capital (ie $100,000 Account .. Only purchase in $2000,00 lots   2) You must still set a Stop Loss on the original purchase (Can be set pretty wide due to the lower amount of capital used to initiate the trade .. (Perhaps up to 50% of T/V=$1000.00 .. =1% of Capital )    3) Only average down on heavyweights such as BHP, CBA, WPL etc. (Specs require a different approach)   4) Only average down on Pivot lows which have signaled a reversal  (Possibly the most important rule imo..N.B. You would never actually buy the second Average Down lot if the Technical Analysis criteria was not met (Pivot bottom- reverse etc)    Therefore maximum exposure would still only be 2% of T/C if the stock goes belly up   5) If the original purchase gets into profit quickly, simply average up . When in profit, you can obviously use shorter time frames for the pivot lows to take advantage of the trend (Trading as opposed to Investing)       All only my observations and opinions and obviously  Rules have to be fine tuned to suit the individual, but happy to be proven wrong .       PS Personally, Id be pretty wary of averaging down more than a second time .. That leaves the loss on a belly up stock at a maximum 4% Capital loss, which is bearable considering it wont happen very often on heavyweight stocks.
