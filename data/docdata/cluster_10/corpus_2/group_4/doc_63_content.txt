Rothschild hires three M&amp;amp;amp;A bankers from Lehman   Mon Oct 27, 2008 8:16am EDTPost Your Comments   All Comments Email    Print   Share  Reprints   Single Page   Recommend (0) [-] Text  [+] Featured Broker sponsored link   Trading will never be the same.LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Boutique  investment bank Rothschild has hired three M&amp;amp;amp;A bankers from  Lehman Brothers in a sign that some smaller banks remain confident  even as the credit crisis ravages their larger rivals.      Rothschild, a more than two centuries old family-owned business,  said it had appointed Antonio Villalon as co-head of its Global  Financial Institutions Group (FIG).      &amp;quot;We are seeing significant demand for our FIG-related independent  advice,&amp;quot; the bank said on Monday.      Boutique banks have an opportunity to expand now that only two  major investment banks -- Morgan Stanley (MS.N: Quote, Profile,  Research, Stock Buzz) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N: Quote, Profile,  Research, Stock Buzz) -- have survived the credit crisis  independently, while others have been bought or have failed.      Rothschild also named Stephen Fox as co-head of its UK FIG, while  Philippe Le Baquer joined to work on FIG deals in continental  Europe and on cross-border deals.      All three bankers joined from Lehman Brothers, which filed for  bankruptcy in September. Most of Lehman&amp;#039;s assets have been sold to  Barclays (BARC.L: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) and Nomura  (8604.T: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz).      Rothschild has advised on the Dutch government&amp;#039;s 10 billion euro  ($12.44 billion) recapitalisation of ING Groep (ING.AS: Quote,  Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) and the sale of Lehman&amp;#039;s Asian  operations to Nomura, amongst other deals, it said.
