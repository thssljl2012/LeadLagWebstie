           Two insurance companies I&amp;#039;d be hot for right now are AIG and CV Starr. AIG&amp;#039;s not going anywhere, our government buying them out proved that, so if you can pick some up at $2 it&amp;#039;s almost a guarantee it&amp;#039;s going to see double digits again.      CV Starr is just a hunch, but if you research it a little you&amp;#039;ll see why I like it.
