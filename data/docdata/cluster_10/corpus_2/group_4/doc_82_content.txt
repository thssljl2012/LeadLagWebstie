          So lets go to the Middle-East and sell our souls to them, even if the terms are worse, than what is on offer from Her Majesties Government.    The deal that Barclays have done is actually better that what was on offer from the Treasury.  The headline rate of interest may look high (at circa 14%) compared to the 12% rate that the Treasury are getting on their prefs but the instrument that Barclays have issued is tax deductible and so on a post-tax basis Barclays are actually paying less.  Also the instrument that they&amp;#039;ve issued (&amp;amp;quot;Reserve Capital Instruments&amp;amp;quot;) is marginally inferior to the preference shares that the Treasury were suggesting and gives them more flexibility.  The comment being passed amongst bankers is that Barclays couldn&amp;#039;t afford to take the Government&amp;#039;s offer othwerwise they&amp;#039;d have lost a huge (enormous) chunk of the earnings from Barclays Capital.  Barclays are one of the biggest tax avoiders in the industry, see:   www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/special-report/article.html?in_ar...   If the Government had become a big shareholder in Barclays then would they have continued to support Barclays&amp;#039; tax avoidance business?  JakNife
