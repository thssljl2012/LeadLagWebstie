 continued   &amp;quot;The primary government security dealer banks are like a private club,&amp;quot; Bolser told WND. &amp;quot;You get to stay in the club as long as you take the repurchase agreements and enter the markets to implement Fed monetary policy the way the Fed wants it implemented. Violate the unspoken rules, and you risk being thrown out of the club.&amp;quot;   Yesterday&amp;#039;s $18 billion addition to the repurchase agreement pool caused the total amount of the outstanding repurchase agreement pool to remain below the DJIA 30-day moving average in a clear trend.   Bolser used this data to predict the Fed was manipulating the stock market lower, a controversial prediction when most economists see the Fed&amp;#039;s emergency actions to reduce the target Fed Funds rate 1.25 percentage points lower  over an eight-day period  that ended with last Wednesday&amp;#039;s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.   &amp;quot;Ultimately, the government is in the business of inflating the dollar,&amp;quot; Bolser said, &amp;quot;so the Fed is trying to engineer a recession, in order to cushion the pernicious effects of its own inflation.&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;In my view, the government intentionally desires a deep recession not unlike that of the 1930s,&amp;quot; he continued. &amp;quot;The Fed, however, dissembles, attempting to display the opposite impression with its rate cuts.&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;Cutting rates will not boost the economy in an environment where the credit bubble has burst and banks are afraid to lend,&amp;quot; he explained. &amp;quot;But decreasing the repurchase pool will push the economy down, especially when the primary banks execute monetary policy in accordance with the wishes of the Fed to short the market with future contracts that push the indices down.&amp;quot;   Bolser argued the Fed&amp;#039;s ability to manipulate the market by increasing or decreasing the pool of available repurchase agreements amounts to a &amp;quot;stealth methodology&amp;quot; where the Fed can now depress the market, while implementing a policy of lowering interest rates, which most economists would see as trying to stimulate economic growth and the stock market.   &amp;quot;You have to remember the primary goal of the Fed is to support the bond market, which the Fed has done for quarter century,&amp;quot; Bolser stressed. &amp;quot;The Fed needs a strong bond market so the Treasury can sell the enormous amount of Treasury securities, especially to China, that we need to sell to finance what this year may be as large as a $400 billion dollar budget deficit calculated on a cash basis.&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;As a result, the friend of the Fed is the bond speculator,&amp;quot; he added.   Among the U.S. banks and securities firms currently on the list are Bank of America Securities, Cantor Fitzgerald, Countrywide Securities, Bear Stearns, Daiwa Securities America, Goldman Sachs, Greenwich Capital Markets, HSBC Securities (USA), J.P. Morgan Securities, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch Government Securities, and Morgan Stanley.   Also on the list are France&amp;#039;s BNP Paribas Securities, Great Britain&amp;#039;s Barclays Capital, Switzerland&amp;#039;s Credit Suisse Securities, Japan&amp;#039;s Mizuho Securities, and Germany&amp;#039;s Dresden Kleinwort Wasserstein Securities.   &amp;quot;These dealers are the foot soldiers of the Fed, as it implements monetary policy,&amp;quot; Bolser said.   Studying Bolser&amp;amp;#8217;s &amp;quot;Repos/DOW&amp;quot; chart from Dec. 7, 2007, through yesterday, a broad correlation between the downward movement in the Fed repurchase agreements pool totals and the DJIA as seen by tracking the 30-day moving average is clear.      &amp;quot;With this strategy, the Fed hopes we won&amp;#039;t experience the extreme &amp;#039;stag-flation&amp;#039; we had in the late-1970s,&amp;quot; he argues. &amp;quot;The Fed hopes to induce a recession to manage downward  stock prices  and commodity prices, including oil, gold, copper, and lumber, as well as the overall consumer demand for retail goods.&amp;quot;      &amp;quot;Stag-flation&amp;quot; is an unusual economic situation combined when economic stagnation is combined with inflation, much as the economy is currently experiencing, such that economists fear we are entering a recession while food and energy prices continue to rise sharply.
