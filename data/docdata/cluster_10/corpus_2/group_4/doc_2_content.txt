   Peak oil obviously is not the cause of this economic disaster.        Actually, I will make a prediction.  Have you noticed a certain trend about the largest corporations?  They are getting in trouble, and it&amp;#039;s going from mortgage industry, to insurance (AIG), to investment banking, to commercial banking, and now the auto industry.  What do they all have in common?  They are all merging, selling themselves or looking for bailouts.  The bailout is the interesting part because once the government bails out an institution, that institution de facto becomes government owned (indirectly).        Peak oil is not really going on.  What&amp;#039;s going on is a massive corporate restructuring, with the Fed and the U.S. Treasury at the top of the pyramid.          Next in line are the retailers, oil companies, and pharmaceutical companies.  I believe that oil will get extremely low, on the order of $20, and the oil companies will then need bailouts.        It&amp;#039;s a giant ponzi scheme to basically incorporate all of the American industry under one umbrella.  The trend speaks for itself, and it doesn&amp;#039;t look like it&amp;#039;s reversing.        Oil went below $49 today.  If it goes much lower than I think that is enough evidence that peak oil is nothing more than a tunnel-vision myth.
