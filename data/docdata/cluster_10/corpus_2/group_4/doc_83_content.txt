For the most part I agree with you, but banks and financial institutions are designed to be able to handle a certain amount of losses at any one time, but right now they are bending, and some are breaking from the stress of the mortgage defaults.  Now if they have more defaults on the auto company loans, they could be crippled.  If in 2 years the housing crisis is over, they will be able to handle the auto companies defaulting.    I still agree with you though.        .                      This is what I don&amp;#039;t understand.     While I know in principle you are against the bailout, you must realize the logical reasoning behind it.     I&amp;#039;m not all for the bailout either, I wish we didn&amp;#039;t have one, but at this point, without it our economy would be more in the tubes than it already is.     GM won&amp;#039;t be able to establish long-term anything after bankruptcy if there isn&amp;#039;t an economy around to purchase its vehicles, and the American people won&amp;#039;t realize this &amp;amp;quot;25 billion saved&amp;amp;quot; if we go into a depression, which means trillions lost in securities markets and from lost opportunity and job destruction, not just in the Auto industry, but in supporting industries like Steel.     Also, while it would be unlikely GM would be able to receive DIP loans at this point in time, once our credit markets start to gain strength, bankruptcy may be a viable option, instead of the USG supporting them, because Debtor in Possession financing will be more widely available.     I also don&amp;#039;t think f1ve quite understands the way Credit Backed Securities work. These are securities issued based entirely in the repayment of financing GM currently has. However, companies like AIG sell insurance on GM&amp;#039;s financing relative to its amount of risk so that if GM does default the securities (bonds) can be paid making them relatively low-risk bonds. Currently the credit rating of GM is CCC, one step above default. If GM c pay down the debt more of these &amp;amp;quot;bonds&amp;amp;quot; will be paid off.
