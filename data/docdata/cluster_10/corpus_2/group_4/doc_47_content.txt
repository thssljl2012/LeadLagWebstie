         Hi,   With the announcement today of the large stakes being taken in Barclays by Middle East investors it went virtually unnoticed that from the second half of next year Barclays intend to start paying quarterly dividends.   With the other good news that profits were slightly ahead of this time last year I was  amazed  the share price went into a steep dive after an initial rally.  I decided that I would take the risk and average down  adding 12,500 shares at prices of 1.56 and 1.64 to my existing holding.  Any private investor complaining they are  not being offered new shares in the fund raising has every opportunity to buy  in the open market.  The way it has been reported in the media looks absurd.  Complaints that they should have opted into the UK Government scheme are plain wrong.  The 14% rate Barclays is paying is tax deductible, in contrast to banks paying 12% in the UK Government scheme.  Barclays will be able to resume its dividends (now on a quarterly basis) much sooner than RBS and Lloyds TSB.  which  should make it attractive to income seekers.  Currently on a pe of about 2.5 I would expect by this time next year Barclays will command a much higher rating. I was not surprised that in the final auction today after two price monitoring extensions the price jumped off  its lows and closed at about 1.79p.  Goldpig
