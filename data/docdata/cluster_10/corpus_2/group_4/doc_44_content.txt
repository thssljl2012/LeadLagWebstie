          I was looking for reasoned argument not just posturing   Could&amp;#039;ve fooled me.....you appeared to be grandstanding.    - perhaps you hold BARC    ROTFLMAO....   or have some other reason for being less bearish on them. If you do you&amp;#039;re not making much of a case for BARC vs rest of the sector.    I&amp;#039;ve made the case in a number of posts over the last year. In sum I think that Barclays&amp;#039; people are likely to have a better grip on the risks and their assets than the others, partly thanks to the background of Diamond and other senior managers.   My case is simple - you&amp;#039;ll soon see a prospectus from RBS &amp;amp;amp; LLOY/HBOS. Meanwhile BARCs books will remain firmly shut.   Why would an investor in ordinary shares want to take BARC&amp;#039;s management&amp;#039;s word for the quality of their assets. Especially as they have been locked out two serious SWF dilutions. How are they to know that they wont get diluted yet again in the months to come. How can they guage the extent to write offs at BARC?   .......they will have to wait for the results in the spring - just as they would have been expecting to! I agree that one SHOULD know what the story is from the others before then - but they&amp;#039;ve been revising their figures so often that I&amp;#039;m not sure one should count on it - especially as they now have the government on the hook. Furthermore I&amp;#039;d think that the management change at RBS is likely to prompt an extremely close examination of their books - and I wouldn&amp;#039;t be surprised to see further kitchen-sinking.  ee [waiting for spring results]
