 hi,   i&amp;#039;m new to shares and need some advice/help   The announcement yesterday about issuing shares has me confused, as i understand it if a company has 100 shares to sell and i buy 10 of them. If they then they release another 100, shouldn&amp;#039;t i be issued with a further 10 so that i maintain my % stake in the company?      If this is correct, (i&amp;#039;m with etrade) will my portfolio jump in number of shares held? or do i have to manually adjust it. (and how do ifind out what numbers need adjusting)      If i&amp;#039;m wrong, ugh, I don&amp;#039;t want to think if i&amp;#039;m wrong, i bought when they were 25.10      Thanks for helping!
