         Firstly, just trying to see what this does for dilution as we small shareholders are not able to buy new shares at 1.53!  I make it that there are 8.37B ord shares now and that worse-case there could be 4.33B extra new shares, making a new total of about 12.70B.  As a very rough guess, at an old 6 per share, Barclays was capitalised at about 50B (for 2006/7).  For this same value we get about 4 per share.  I know this is extremely fag-paper stuff but, in the near term environment, it suggests to me that we will be doing well in the next year or two to see a share price starting with a 3.  Next, the 3B worth of RCIs cost 14% for the next 10 years which is about 420M, after tax.  In old money that&amp;#039;s about 5p knocked off the dividend.  Finally, what&amp;#039;s this going to do to the share price?  Well, there are institutional investors out there who can effectively buy about 1B of new shares at 1.53 (about 12% of the existing total).  If they don&amp;#039;t want to commit new money (and who would!), do you think they may decide to sell at a higher price?  I reckon this is going to drive the price down towards 1.53 - it&amp;#039;s just a question of how close it gets.  So, in the end we may be able to buy at 1.53 afterall!
