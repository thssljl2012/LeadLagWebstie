         So, every day I boot up my Money Software and have a look at the &amp;#039;ol HYP compared to my other investments. I see about half the HYP shares above water (or there abouts) and the rest of my basket cases heavily in the red (based on 3 year holding). It&amp;#039;s been fun watching the decent companies that consumers still need (VOD TATE etc) urge themselves out of the red each day, with the 5% index swings we have seen been happening.   However the following deliquent shares (more than 40% total drop) exist now, in order of trouble (Total Return all in %)  Kingfinsher (-39) ishares FTSE Dividend plus (-40) BT (-41) Lloyds (-50) Rank (-59) Rentokil (-62) Barclays (-64) F&amp;amp;amp;C (-67) DSGI (-71) Banco Santander (-80)  So I&amp;#039;m thinking of cutting my losses on some of these and putting the monies into a ETF tracker. It&amp;#039;s basically a question of which one&amp;#039;s do I think will recoup their losses in say 3 years.   Banks for me have the best chance of recovery, simply becuase the crisis has hit this sector the hardest. However all the non banks (including the ishares HYP type ETF) are the ones I think have no real chance of outperformance. They were just bad picks I think and the index offers a better chance of outperformance now.  what do you guys think? This is to try and avoid a sell low type mistake as I&amp;#039;ll still be channeling the money back into the market.
