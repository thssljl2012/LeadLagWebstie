          So his alternative strategy is presumably to simply replace 401(k)&amp;#039;s with something like the Feds Thrift Savings Plan, to which 3rd party TPAs play no part.   It was my understanding that the TSP is administered by Barclays, and that the funds all have expense ratios, though quite low.  I don&amp;#039;t believe that anyone in the government would actually know how to run a mutual fund or funds, so there is still a third party involved.  foolazis
