          However the following deliquent shares (more than 40% total drop) exist now, in order of trouble (Total Return all in %)  Kingfinsher (-39) ishares FTSE Dividend plus (-40) BT (-41) Lloyds (-50) Rank (-59) Rentokil (-62) Barclays (-64) F&amp;amp;amp;C (-67) DSGI (-71) Banco Santander (-80)  So I&amp;#039;m thinking of cutting my losses on some of these and putting the monies into a ETF tracker. It&amp;#039;s basically a question of which one&amp;#039;s do I think will recoup their losses in say 3 years.  Banks for me have the best chance of recovery, simply becuase the crisis has hit this sector the hardest. However all the non banks (including the ishares HYP type ETF) are the ones I think have no real chance of outperformance. They were just bad picks I think and the index offers a better chance of outperformance now.  what do you guys think? This is to try and avoid a sell low type mistake as I&amp;#039;ll still be channeling the money back into the market.   Don&amp;#039;t do it. The odds are that the ones you decide to dump will be those that recover the most. You are not alone in what you see. Here is my portfolio, showing the gain (loss) on each holding. There are two columns. The first takes the gain or loss when profit has been taken and thus reduced the original cost, the second (rebased) column ignores profit taken, and relates only to the cost of the shares. If the numbers in the two columns are the same, no profit has been taken on that holding.

PFL is the only exception.  I&amp;#039;ve been through this situation a few times in the past, when everything looks red, and you wonder if you&amp;#039;ve done the right thing, but you have. Just wait.  TJH
