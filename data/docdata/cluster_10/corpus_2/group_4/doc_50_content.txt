          At least Barclay owners will get a dividend next year. My guess it will be more than the shareholders think if RBS and Lloyds  sell assets quickly, and badly, to repay the prefs.    Thats a good point! I think RBS/LLOY will be busting a gut to get out of the Government&amp;#039;s clutches - and so there is something to be said for being a capable and potential buyer (at the &amp;amp;quot;right&amp;amp;quot; price). Bear in mind the Lehman deal and the expertise therein  - asset trading might be a major element of next year&amp;#039;s business for Barclays as a whole!  ee
