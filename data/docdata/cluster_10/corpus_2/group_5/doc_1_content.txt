At the same time, falling stock prices in the bank sector will pressure other banks to shore up their equity. That will mean that many will have to seek large capital infusions and investments. That translates to more reliance on foreign banks, sovereign-wealth funds and private-equity firmsinvestors who have the deep pockets to provide such infusions.        Heres how it works. it starts with Tier 1 capital, which is the gauge of a banks health watched by regulators.  It measures whether a bank has sufficient capital to cushion future losses. Tier 1 capital is comprised of common stock, the portion of earnings not paid out as dividends and retained by a company, and disclosed reserves against losses. But with stock prices and earnings down, Tier 1 ratios are under pressure across the industry.  The federal government requires a minimum Tier 1 ratio of 4%, and 8% is typically thought to be robust.        Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group reporting their Tier 1 capital this year. Goldmans Tier 1 ratio was 10.8% and Morgan Stanleys was 12.4% as of the second quarter.      Of course, that was before last weeks market bloodbath, which pulled down the banks stocks. Monday, Morgan Stanley agreed to sell as much as a 20% stake to Japans Mitsubishi UFJ Financial include common equity infusion of at least $7 billion, according to Banc of America Securities analyst Michael Hecht, and as much as $9 billion.      And consider existing commercial banks. Bank of Americas Tier 1, which was 8.25% in July, was expected to slip below 8% with its acquisition of troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial and will likely fall further with the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Bank of America said in late July it would target a nearly 8% Tier 1 ratio in coming quarters. Wachovias Tier 1 was 7.2% before a $3.5 billion preferred stock offering in February was designed to boost it to 7.9%.       In addition, Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst David Trone expects the  Fed  to impose leverage ratios of around 20%, far below the nearly 30-to-one levels at Morgan Stanley, Goldman and other investment banks.         Where will more of this money come from?  Well, regulators just loosened the rules governing how much private-equity firms can own of banks. The  Fed  said private investors can take stakes as high as 33% in banks, and 15% of that can be voting stock. Capital infusions from U.S. private-equity firms could could keep U.S. banks in U.S. hands. Capital infusions from foreign sources could spell more discomfort along the lines of the governments earlier unease when foreign sovereign-wealth funds to investing in U.S. banks. Then again, that unease may disperse in a crisis. Beggars, as they say, cant afford to be choosers.
