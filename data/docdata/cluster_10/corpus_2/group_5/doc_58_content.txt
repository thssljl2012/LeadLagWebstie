How values have dropped: A year ago, the Royal Bank of Scotland paid $100 billion for ABN Amro. That would now buy: * Citibank $22,5 billion (down 74%) * Morgan Stanley $10,5 billion (down 72%) * Goldman Sachs $21 billion (down 67%) * Merrill Lynch $12,3 billion (down 77%) * Deutsche Bank $13 billion (down 71%) * Barclays $12,7 billion (down 71%) And still leave $8 billion change - with which you would be able to pick up General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and the Honda F1 team.
