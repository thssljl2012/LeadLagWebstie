The Wall Street bank known as the &amp;amp;quot;thundering herd&amp;amp;quot; agreed to a $50bn takeover by Bank of America on Monday after a hasty 48 hours of negotiation. The talks were prompted by fears over banking stability arising from  the collapse of Lehman Brothers .      Thain, who was previously the head of the New York Stock Exchange, joined Merrill in December with a mandate to steer the bank out of financial trouble. When he arrived, he was given a $15m signing on bonus. If he leaves in Bank of America&amp;#039;s takeover, he stands to get a further $11m in accelerated stock payouts.      Two former  Goldman Sachs  executives hired by Thain are likely to do even better. Merrill&amp;#039;s head of global trading, Thomas Montag, who joined in August, has already received a $39m bonus. Together with stock options accelerated by a buyout, he could end the year with $76m. The bank&amp;#039;s head of strategy, Peter Kraus, was given a $95m package including bonuses and stock awards to replace his generous compensation at Goldman when he joined in May, according to figures obtained by Bloomberg News.....      full story:  http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/...ecutivesalaries                                       __________________          ********      **      *      **      **           http://www.poodwaddle.com/worldclock.swf             **      *********      **      **
