True to a point. All banks took on more loans than they should have, but some were better about it than others. Bank Of America was much more careful in their selection of loans than banks such as Wachovia and WaMu. I'm not surprised about an article such as this. The victors always get to write history and WaMu will be painted by JPM, WFC and others as one of the rotten apples that spoiled the bunch.
