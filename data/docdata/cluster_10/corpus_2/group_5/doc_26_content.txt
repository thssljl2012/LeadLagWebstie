   Sloth     Angelo Mozilo, the former CEO of  Countrywide Financial , now owned by  Bank of America  ( BAC ,  news ,  msgs ).    Mozilo is one of the most recognizable faces in the subprime-lending fiasco -- a glib, smug, fast-talking salesman to the bitter end, even as his company went up in flames around him. Countrywide issued billions in loans to subprime borrowers whose ability to repay was in doubt, then packaged up the loans as securities and sold them off to banks, hedge funds and other large investors who would later wonder what was in the packages.   As CEO, Mozilo should have made it his business to know. That&amp;#039;s where sloth comes in. Mozilo and all the others doling out subprime mortgages should have taken the time to ensure better risk management. But that&amp;#039;s work.     Also afflicted:  Joe Cassano, the president of American International Group&amp;#039;s financial-products division, and plenty of other high-ranking Wall Street executives.     Here&amp;#039;s the thing about getting paid millions of dollars to manage money: You&amp;#039;re supposed to know what you&amp;#039;re doing. You can&amp;#039;t blame the credit-ratings companies for your bad bets. AAA-rated or not, you made the bet. It&amp;#039;s your job to know the finer points of what you bet on.    The same goes for selling insurance protection. You&amp;#039;d better have a pretty complete and accurate risk profile on whatever you&amp;#039;re insuring, whether it&amp;#039;s an ocean liner or a bond. Clearly, Cassano and a lot of other executives who supervised trading in credit default swaps and mortgage-backed securities were not doing their homework.     Gluttony     Aubrey K. McClendon, the CEO of  Chesapeake Energy  ( CHK ,  news ,  msgs ).    A CEO&amp;#039;s willingness to invest in his own company&amp;#039;s stock is admirable. But CEOs need to stay aligned with the interests of stockholders. When you use margin to leverage your investment to the point where you have to liquidate shares in your own company during a vicious downturn, that&amp;#039;s a case of biting off far more than you can chew. McClendon did exactly that, and he likely has a terrible stomachache as a result.     Also afflicted:  all the speculators in corn futures and the hedge fund managers who believed  Goldman Sachs  ( GS ,  news ,  msgs ) analysts&amp;#039; assertions that oil would hit $200 a barrel this year.
