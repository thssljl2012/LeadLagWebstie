                                                         12 September 2008    Dow Industrial Component AIG Getting a Share-Cut       Probably the most overlooked story of the day is the implosion of insurance giant AIG. The probable reason for this is their exposure to mortgage related insurance AND their CDS exposure to failures in the corporate bonds markets.       There are rumours swirling of some major failures that are imminent. And the Fed and Treasury cannot backstop them all.
