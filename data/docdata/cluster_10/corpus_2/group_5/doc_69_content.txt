                                                           The End of an Era .               -&amp;amp;gt; Posted by   strikerrod   @ 15:18 pm on September 22, 2008            ** The End of an Era on Wall Street    by Michael Lombardi, CFP, MBA     An era came to an end last night, as Goldman Sachs and Morgan   Stanley threw in their towels and asked the Federal Reserve to   recognize them as banks. The investment bank boom on Wall   Street that was led by Bear Sterns, Merrill Lynch, Lehman   Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley has come to an   abrupt end.     Bear Stearns was rescued, while Lehman closed its doors. Merrill   Lynch was bought out by Bank of America; Goldman Sachs and   Morgan Stanley will become regular banks (unless someone buys   them out, too).     Whats the difference between an investment bank and regular   bank? An investment bank takes borrowed capital and uses it for   its investing activities with very little regulation between what it   borrows and what it invests. For example, Morgan Stanley held   $20.00 in assets for every $1.00 of shareholder equity.     Banks are highly regulated (compared to investment banks) by the   Fed and can only lend out a percentage of the deposits they have   on hand from customers. Goldman and Morgan Stanley will now   need to build their deposit base so they can rely on their deposits   from customers instead of using borrowed money.     Goldman and Morgan Stanley are basically going to deposit   banking (using regulated deposits of customers) from investment   banking (using borrowed money to invest). Goldman and Morgan   Stanley already had more than $20.0 billion each in customer   deposits at the end of the second quarter.     What does this all mean for investors like you and me?     Firstly, investment banks are wiped outgone. And so are the big   bonuses on Wall Street. Jobs will be lost. The 25,000 job losses at   Lehman were just the beginning. Expect to see 100,000 white   collar jobs gone from Wall Street. And all those real estate gurus   (including Donald Trump) who told us New York real estate was   immune to a slump are in for a rude awakening.     The days of the highly leveraged buyouts, financed by investment   banks, are gonewhich is a good thing for investors. Maybe we   can all start investing again in companies that actually produce a   product or sell a service. Personally, I believe the withdrawal of   the investment banks makes it safer for investorssomewhat of a   regression to the mean.     As for the stock market, it likes what the Fed and Secretary of the   Treasury are doing for investors. I was around in the days of the   Resolution Trust Corporation (it was set up for the assets of the   savings and loans crisis) and it was a great idea. The Fed is   basically doing the same thing again, only this time with troubled   loans.     The stock market continues to be very resilient. As soon as the   Dow Jones Industrial Average got down below its July low, it   rallied a good 700 points. Trading over the next few days and   weeks will be very important for overall direction.
