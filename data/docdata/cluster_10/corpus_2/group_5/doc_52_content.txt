 Edited on Sun Dec-14-08 01:39 PM by LittleBlue         BofA itself took over troubled institutions like Merrill and Countrywide as subsidiaries, as they are still operated. Merrill is a NY bank recently bought by BofA partially at the behest of the Fed.   Refer to my other statement above on Washington state banks.   "The banks agreeing to receive equity investments from the Treasury include Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp. (including Merrill Lynch), Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Bank of New York Mellon and State Street Corp.    The Bank of New York Mellon is to serve as master custodian overseeing the fund. "  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troubled_Assets_Relief_Pro...    Considering Merrill is a NY bank before it went tits up, and BofA took it for Countrywide (either way it's non-NY), let's take a look:  $10 billion for non NY BofA Wells took about $25 billion Those two are considered not troubled and received very little.  The rest you see up there are are NY banks that are heavily troubled (except perhaps Goldman), plus AIG (which received over 100 billion between TARP and the Fed) Between the Fed bailout (of over 2 trillion) and the TARP bailout (700 billion), those NY banks received the largest share. I daresay it could not be less than 80%, conservatively. Excluding the other heavily troubled banks like Citi, just the AIG loan vs. Wells and BofA makes it a 70% NY thing.   Sorry!
