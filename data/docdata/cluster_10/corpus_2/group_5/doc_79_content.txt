                     AW: TRADING-CAF &amp;amp;#9679; Oktober 2008                                    Merrill Lynch&amp;#039;s quarter shows multibillion-dollar losses            Zitat:                         WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Merrill Lynch &amp;amp;amp; Co. reported a third-quarter net loss of $7.47 billion, or $5.58 a share, wider than the loss of $2.2 billion, or $2.82 a share, registered in the same period during 2007. The New York-based investment firm, which has agreed to be acquired by Bank of America Corp.  (BAC) , generated $16 million in revenue for the latest quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of a variety of write-downs that were partially offset by one-time gains. The company&amp;#039;s loss from continuing operations worked out to $5.1 billion, or $5.56 a share, wider than a comparable loss of $2.4 billion, or $2.99 a share, for the year-earlier third quarter.       The consensus in a survey of 16 analysts by FactSet Research had been for Merrill Lynch to post a quarterly loss of $4.97 a share. &amp;amp;quot;We continue to reduce exposures and deleverage the balance sheet prior to the closing of the Bank of America deal,&amp;amp;quot; said John Thain, chairman and chief executive, in a statement.                                                          __________________       &amp;amp;#9658;   Bundesliga-Tippspiel 2008/09        &amp;amp;#9658;   Champions League Tippspiel
