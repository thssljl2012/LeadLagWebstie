          I know Northern Trust fairly well from my days on the other side of the pond - I would say that the major issue with them is going to be that they are heavily into the custody / asset management side of things - they're a large player in custody (along with places like BoNY Mellon and State Street) and with the way that AUM's have been plummeting, then their AUM based income is going to be very badly hit over the coming few years. It may not have filtered through to Q3 income statements yet, but I suspect that outlook statements in that area would be very negatively phrased.   I'd just like to completely endorse Kirkie's comments on Northern Trust, having had many dealings with them over this side.  FWIW  The US bank I'd be keenest on buying is the BofA/Merrill/Countrywide combination......trouble is I have no idea at what price!!  ee
