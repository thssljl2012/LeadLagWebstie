       Well, we'll see if the Majority Leader is a good short-term-market-caller or not :-). We also have Bank of America laying off 35,000, though all prior layoffs have been greeted by rallies....  Looking at the CHARTS, however, there are a lot of possible reads here, including bearish ones that take us mighty far down (including some that give us new lows). One scenario has any down now being a C wave to last Monday's one day tank. That'd be equal legs at around 838 SPX, but can obviously extend.  I think trying to figure out what this move down is, since I don't expect the futures to recover overnight, is now more important than giving price targets the upside or the downside. Maybe we'll get another Friday rally, of course, and we'll know by the end of the day....
