         The problem with buying the US banks, is that it's not just a specific company play, but a dollar play ....I reckon the dollar is in for the mother of all kickings come the spring.   Ok, so Sterling isn't going to be exactly sought after, but it's had a bit of a drubbing (with perhaps a little more to go)- but it makes little sense to buy a dollar denominated bank stock *now* when sterling is so weak ......then with a dollar drubbing waiting in the wings! Talk about a double whammy (&amp;amp; plus, it's not as if the US banking sector is a buy, hold &amp;amp; relax sector!).  Buying a US Bank stock using Sterling right now (even after the drubbing they've had) should be closely aligned to the risk profile of a Base Jumper.
