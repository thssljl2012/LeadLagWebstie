          Buying a US Bank stock using Sterling right now (even after the drubbing they've had) should be closely aligned to the risk profile of a Base Jumper.    Agreed.  I have always kept some of my 'pot' in dollars and never change from/to Sterling.    I do this because I spend in dollars in the winter (because it is much cheaper to live on a boat in the Caribbean than to run the oil-fired heating at home).  S
