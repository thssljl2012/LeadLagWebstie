WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Recent data suggests that many borrowers who received help with mortgage modifications earlier this year tended to re-default on their payments, a top U.S. banking regulator said on Monday.      &amp;amp;quot;The results, I confess, were somewhat surprising, and not in a good way,&amp;amp;quot; said John Dugan, head of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in prepared remarks for a U.S. housing forum.      &amp;amp;quot;Put simply, it shows that over half of mortgage modifications seemed not to be working after six months,&amp;amp;quot; he said.      Dugan said based on data collected from some of the biggest U.S. institutions, like Bank of America, Citibank and JPMorgan Chase, home foreclosure starts fell 2.6 percent in the three months ended in September.
