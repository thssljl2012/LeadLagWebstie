That may be the case.   Although I also suspect that with Buffet being heavily involved with AIG and insurance in general, he is on the bad side of  many  swaps.     He may be liquifying companies that if gone bankrupt would lose him a lot of money. In essence it's costing him lots now to keep these companies afloat but it'd cost him even more if they went bust.     Although with GS I think that Buffett knows that they're now the top dog on Wall St. hand in hand with JP Morgan Chase   GS knew this %%%* was coming way back in late 2005, early 2006. They're the ones who began speculating in oil futures in 2006  as they pulld their money from many other markets (feeling that they'd go bust). GS made a pretty penny on oil specualtion. Enough to come out on top, so far, after BS and LB fiascos.                                                                                            &amp;quot;Hank Paulson is an arsonist and pyromaniac-in-chief...&amp;quot; -Max Keiser      First World Corruption
