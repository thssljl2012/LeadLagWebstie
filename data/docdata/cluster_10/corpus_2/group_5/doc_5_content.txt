 Eh, I read he told the board to not give bonuses somewhere a few days ago. But barring that, this guy on another board (who hates rich people) probably said it best.    The difference between John Thain and Dick Fuld is that one was in charge of a company that still exists, and another is not. Thain is the garbageman who took out the trash and is the sole reason why Merrill exists at all. His performance saved billions in shareholder value.  He was hired in in late 2007 (started on Dec 1). He came in, said &amp;quot;holy f*****g s*** you guys are about to explode&amp;quot; and probably went around selling subsidiaries and de-leveraging the company to the point where they could actually be sold to Bank of America. The comparison to Lehman Bros is apt because the only difference between the two companies was pretty much CEO performance, they were both in the same pile of s***. Pretty much anything they pay Thain is worth it, even though he was only able to get about 50 cents on the dollar for the company, because the alternative would have been getting zero cents.  That said if you are looking for a reason to hate on the guy he is a gigantic Republican. Huge. He has other, smaller Republicans in orbit around him.
