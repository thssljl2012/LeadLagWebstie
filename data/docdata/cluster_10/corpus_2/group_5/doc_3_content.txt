 http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28069615       (snip)&amp;amp;quot;Taxpayers out billions so far on bank holdings   Some Treasury investments down $9 billion in a month, AP analysis finds      WASHINGTON - Stock intended to eventually earn taxpayers a profit as part of the Bush administration&amp;#039;s massive bank bailout has lost a third of its value  about $9 billion  in barely one month, according to an Associated Press analysis. Shares in virtually every bank that received federal money have remained below the prices the government negotiated.      Even as stocks dropped steadily at the opening bell on Friday in reaction to a larger-than-expected number of job losses, a top Treasury Department official told the Mortgage Bankers Association that the tax dollars are being invested in &amp;amp;quot;very high-quality institutions of all sizes.&amp;amp;quot;      &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;#039;re not day traders, and we&amp;#039;re not looking for a return tomorrow&amp;amp;quot; said Neel Kashkari, the director of Treasury&amp;#039;s Office of Financial Stability, which oversees the $700 billion financial rescue fund. &amp;amp;quot;Over time, we believe the taxpayers will be protected and have a return on their investment.&amp;amp;quot;(snip)      (snip)Most of the Treasury Department&amp;#039;s investments since late October have been in preferred bank stocks, more than $180 billion worth, with investments in giants like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, and many small community banks. But the government also negotiated options to buy up to 1.2 billion shares of common bank stock that was valued at $27 billion.      The Treasury Department said it did not expect these common stock options to be profitable immediately and negotiated them so taxpayers could share in the wealth if the bank stocks recover.      Now, however, the value of that common stock is less than $18 billion. If the government exercised all its warrants to purchase the stock today, it would lose money on 51 of its 53 agreements. Taxpayers would be out $9.3 billion.      The government can exercise its options to buy the common stock anytime over the next decade, but the options were &amp;amp;quot;immediately exercisable,&amp;amp;quot; according to banks&amp;#039; securities filings.      &amp;amp;quot;The markets are saying this plan isn&amp;#039;t going to work for the banks,&amp;amp;quot; said Ross Levine, Tisch professor of economics at Brown University. &amp;amp;quot;They&amp;#039;re asking where this plan is going.&amp;amp;quot;      Potential losses among these common stocks include more than $3 billion for the administration&amp;#039;s biggest deal, a $45 billion injection into Citigroup Inc. The government gave the New York-based giant $25 billion on Oct. 28. In addition to preferred stock worth $1,000 per share, the deal included warrants to pick up 210 million shares of common stock at $17.85. In late November, the White House put together a plan to give Citibank another $20 billion. The deal also included warrants to pick up 254 million shares, with the price set at $10.61.      Citigroup stock has since fallen below $8.&amp;amp;quot;(snip)         in other words, if you&amp;#039;re a US taxpayer prepare to &amp;#039;bend over&amp;#039;                                                                                                                                                                                                   Melonie                  View Public Profile                           Visit Melonie&amp;#039;s homepage!
