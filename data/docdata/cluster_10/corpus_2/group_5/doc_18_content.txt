here is Nov 4 - Nov 20 15 days total. http://stockcharts.com/c-sc/sc?s=SPY&amp;p=D&amp;st=2008-11-04&amp;en=2008-11-20&amp;i=p97130548273&amp;a=156553401&amp;r=8227 As well, I am using measured pattern targets, and those are the targets they give me. I never said when we would get there, just that we could get there. Sooner the better for shorts and puts. I was being conservative. I am actually expecting $SPX 500, so that is SPY @ $50. This is derived from M pattern top on long-term SPY chart. Also SPY day chart has descending triangle pattern that will most likely assuredly bring us back to at least $75 to test the so-called bottom. I will lighten up around spy @ $75 for sure, but save some puts for -75 if we are not close to expiration. Fundamentally I do not think the credit crises is over. I am expecting Morgan Stanley to fail soon, as well as Citibank, and HSBC has the most credit default swaps, they are dropping like a rock. Europe will suffer first starting very soon, they will be in a recession and they will devalue their currency which may cause a resurgence of the US dollar uptrend. Japan is already devaluing their currency. If everyone tries to save themselves by devaluing their currencies to fight deflation, then money will be worth nothing soon which will cause great depression. All in my opinion of course.
