          yeah all of the temps have gone      i think im quite lucky with my role though seeing that as long as stocks and shares exist there will be need for corporate actions staff      real busy at the mo with company liquidations, companies issueing shares to raise capital by rights issues and open offers, companys merging and being bought up by the richer companies looking to gain a fat market share while they can      so fingers crossed it will be ok for me       some companies (hopefully mine) will come out of this depression really strongly.      JP have bought up bear stearns,washington mutual and some others so really going to be the big player along with bank of america.      your job safe due to the merger?
