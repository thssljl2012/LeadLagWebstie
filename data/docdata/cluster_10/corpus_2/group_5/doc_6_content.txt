I don't think so. More Bks May End '09 With Losses As Comml RE Worsens -Analyst 12/11 10:53 AM NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--More large banks are likely to report losses in the fourth quarter and next year, and many will need to cut their dividends, as the loss cycle in commercial loans deepens, UBS analyst Matthew O'Connor said Thursday. O'Connor cut his 2009 earnings estimates by more than half for the banks he still expects to turn a profit next year - he expects seven of the 16 large banks he covers to post full-year losses. His earnings forecasts for next year are now on average 60% below the Street's consensus estimate. "We now forecast a severe credit cycle in commercial and commercial real estate - with losses peaking at 2%-plus for most banks," O'Connor said. O'Connor's estimate cuts come at a time when an increasing number of businesses are laying off employees as they report weaker demand trends that will extend into next year. Bank stocks fell in recent trading, with US Bancorp (USB:$25.70,00$-1.97,00-7.12%) down 6.2% to $25.96 and Wells Fargo (WFC:$27.12,00$-2.07,00-7.09%) down 5.9% to $27.46. The KBW Bank Index fell 3.7% to $ 45.01. O'Connor expects Comerica Inc. (CMA:$19.88,00$-1.06,00-5.06%) , First Horizon National Corp. (FHN:$9.56,00$-0.19,00-1.95%) , Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB:$7.53,00$-0.20,00-2.59%) , Keycorp (KEY:$8.30,00$-0.34,00-3.94%) , Marshall &amp; Ilsley Corp. (MI:$12.3800,$-0.3200,-2.52%) and Regions Financial Corp. (RF:$8.74,00$-0.23,00-2.56%) and Zions Bancorp (ZION:$28.25,00$-0.08,00-0.28%) to post full-year losses for 2009. In addition raising his prediction of commercial loan losses to 2% from 1.5%, he also now sees peak credit card losses at 9% rather than 8% and loan loss reserve builds reaching 2%-2.5% of assets by mid-2009 rather than his previous view of 1.7%. On the other side of the balance sheet, O'Connor expects bank revenues to decline due to lower net interest margins caused by continued competition for deposits, as well as lower revenue from their capital markets businesses and from service fees, both due to weaker market and economic activity. Dividend cuts will also be under review again, O'Connor said, saying it's possible "most (if not all) banks will cut their dividends before the cycle turns." He believes the companies most at risk of dividend cuts in the near term include Bank of America Corp. (BAC:$16.07,00$-0.62,00-3.71%) , Marshall &amp; Ilsley (MI:$12.3800,$-0.3200,-2.52%) , Suntrust Banks Inc. (STI:$27.76,00$-0.62,00-2.18%) and Zions Bancorp (ZION:$28.25,00$-0.08,00-0.28%) . -By Ed Welsch, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5244; edward.welsch@dowjones.com Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http:// www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=OBSC4tG5tv93CjIHwO9G9A%3D%3D.
