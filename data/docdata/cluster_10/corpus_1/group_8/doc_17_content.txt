Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis made headlines last week when he wrote in a memo that the bank 'does not need further assistance today and I don't believe we'll need any more in the future.' Let's just say not everyone is convinced. TheStreet.com notes estimates from an Egan Jones analyst that Bank of America will need an additional $100 billion over the next three months, due to losses stemming from Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch, both of which are still struggling.  Most people assume that further aid would follow the Citi model of boosting the government's stake in common shares and retiring preferred shares. On one hand, Bank of America's TCE was not looking as bad as Citi's. On the other hand, why stick the bank with hefty dividend payments that it will struggle to make?
