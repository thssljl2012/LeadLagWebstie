 NEW YORK - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has agreed to sell the portfolio of New York Stock Exchange market maker Bear Wagner Specialists LLC to Barclays Capital Group, according to a statement released by NYSE Euronext on Monday.  Financial terms were not disclosed.  Specialists are members of an exchange who act as market makers to facilitate the trading of a stock. Bear Wagner was created when Bear Stearns purchased Wagner Stott in early 2001. JPMorgan took on the specialist firm when it acquired the failed investment bank last year.  According to the statement, the deal will make Barclays Capital the largest designated market maker on the New York Stock Exchange, representing more than 850 NYSE-listed issues and roughly 28 per cent of its average daily trading volume.  The designated market maker assignments are expected to shift to Barclays Capital from Bear Wagner in April, depending on regulatory approvals and other customary conditions.  Bank of America Specialist; Barclays Capital; Kellogg Specialist Group; LaBranche and Co.; and Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg Specialists will be the five remaining NYSE designated market makers following the acquisition.  JPMorgan shares slipped 3 cents to close at $15.90 on Monday. Barclays' U.S.-listed shares fell 18 cents, or 5.1 per cent, to finish at $3.33.
