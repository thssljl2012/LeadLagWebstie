New York investigators have been investigating $3.6 billion in bonus pay awarded to Merrill Lynch employees.  The Financial Times has reported a large part of the investigation is concentrating on the extravagant bonuses paid after Merrill Lynch and its purchaser, Bank of America, had accepted billions of dollars in emergency funds from the government.  The probe is also looking into the massive bonus awards paid to traders who are suspected of manipulating the market while in the employ of the banks.  New York prosecutors have already accused Bank of America of shielding information their employees may have to offer.
