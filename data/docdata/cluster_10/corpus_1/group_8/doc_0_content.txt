NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp (News/Aktienkurs) can avoid the fate of rival Citigroup (News/Aktienkurs) and post strong earnings once the turmoil is over, Barron's said.   Shares of Bank of America have sunk 75 percent so far this year, on fears that the largest U.S. bank by assets could follow the steps of Citigroup, whose shares fell below $1 last week hurt by doubts about its ability to survive the financial crisis.   Citigroup shares fell to all-time lows on Thursday underscoring the loss in confidence that the lender can be restored to health despite receiving $45 billion of taxpayer-funded capital since October, and federal efforts to stimulate the economy and lending.   But Bank of America and Citigroup are different, the weekly business newspaper said in its latest edition dated March 9.   Citigroup had to convert preferred shares into common stock to boost its capital ratios, a move that will give the U.S. government up to a 36 percent stake in the bank.   But Bank of America could strengthen its capital ratios by retaining earnings, shrinking its balance sheet, and selling assets.   The bank could raise at least $3 billion by selling assets such as First Republican Bank, a private bank it inherited from Merrill Lynch; Columbia Management and Balboa Insurance.   In addition, the bank is expected to post a profit in the first quarter and in 2009, while Citigroup is seen losing money in the same periods, Barron's said.   Bank of America has been setting aside money to cover loan losses, but the newspaper said that once the crisis is over, those reserves could be converted into profits.   Barron's said Bank of America could generate $25 billion, or $4 a share, in earnings when the economy recovers.   Bank of America shares ended down 0.95 percent on Friday at $3.14 on the New York Stock Exchange.
