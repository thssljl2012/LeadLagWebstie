Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general of New York, on Wednesday claimed Merrill Lynch was misleading Congress over its plans to award billions of dollars in bonuses last December. He also suggested that Bank of America, which was then in the midst of buying the brokerage firm, did little to prevent the payouts.   As part of his investigation into the Bank of America-Merrill deal, Mr. Cuomo disclosed portions of testimony taken from important executives, including Kenneth D. Lewis, the embattled chief executive of Bank of America.   According to the testimony, made public in a state court filing, Mr. Lewis told Mr. Cuomos office that he had not been focused on the timing of the December payouts because he was concerned about some pretty big things going on. He relied on the conservative judgment of his deputies to curb the payouts because of losses at Merrill.  News of the bonuses  about $3.6 billion in total  prompted an uproar. The payments were determined in early December, before the extent of Merrills problems were publicly known, and before Merrill had accelerated the payment decisions weeks earlier than usual.   Mr. Cuomo has subpoenaed senior executive at both companies to determine who knew about the bonuses and when. He is also examining Merrills losses in the fourth quarter, the marks that traders took on their books and whether the bank disclosed adequate information to shareholders before the merger closed.   A New York state judge is considering whether to require Bank of America to provide the names of the top 200 earners at Merrill and the amounts they earned. In a statement on Wednesday, Bank of America said it had cooperated with the investigation and continually offered to provide the bonus information provided they were kept confidential.   The court filing provided a few new details in the story line of the poisoned merger.  Mr. Lewis, in his deposition, asserted that John A. Thain, the former chief of Merrill, wanted a $40 million bonus and said that Mr. Thain was told, you would damage yourself with the Bank of America board if you do that, and if you ever wanted a chance to be in the running for my job, then that would eliminate it. J. Steele Alphin, the Bank of Americas chief administrative officer, also said that Mr. Thain had been focused on his personal bonus and raised the issue with Mr. Alphin in September, shortly after the deal was announced. According to Mr. Alphin, Mr. Thain told him: Well, I really think Im worth that. A spokesman for Mr. Thain declined to comment on the specifics of the conversation. But he said that Mr. Thain had never formally requested any bonus from Merrills board, although it is widely known that Mr. Thain did so only after learning he had no chance of receiving one.   Andrea Smith, a human resources executive at the bank, said she learned in early November that Merrills broader bonus pool would be paid out in December, rather than the normal January time frame. The bonuses were determined in early December, the witnesses said. Yet Merrill wrote in a letter to Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, on Nov. 24, saying the firm would not determine the bonuses until the very end of the year.  Mr. Cuomo pointedly claimed that Merrill traders had mismarked their books as of early December in an effort to get higher bonuses. It appears that some of these losses may have been booked by Merrill employees who marked down their portfolios only after their 2008 bonuses were set, the attorney general wrote in the filing. Despite the gargantuan unexpected losses, Merrill did not reconsider its bonus awards and Bank of America did not request or demand that Merrill reduce its bonus pool, he wrote.
