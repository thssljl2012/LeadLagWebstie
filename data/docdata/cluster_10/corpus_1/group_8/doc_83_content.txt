NEW YORK -- New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and Rep. Barney Frank are sending a joint letter to Bank of America's chief executive, Ken Lewis, demanding disclosure of bonus details for Merrill Lynch employees.  Bank of America acquired Merrill Jan. 1.  The attorney general's office is in the middle of an investigation into the timing of $3.6 billion in bonuses Merrill paid employees in December just weeks before it completed its sale to Charlotte, N.C.-based BofA and before announcing it lost more than $15 billion in the fourth quarter.  Lewis and Bank of America have been adamant throughout the investigation about not publicly disclosing details about individual bonuses.  Bank of America was not immediately available to comment.
