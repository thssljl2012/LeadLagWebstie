WASHINGTON -- The head of the agency that insures bank deposits said it has plenty of money to cover any failures but it would like 'a bigger cushion.' Sheila Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., said Monday the agency has set aside $22 billion to cover any projected losses over the next year, leaving $19 billion.  Bair said, however, 'We'd like a bigger cushion. We'd like to be prepared for all contingencies.' She said the agency is increasing its reserves through a hike in insurance premiums paid by U.S. banks and thrifts. Just 2 months into the year, 17 federally insured banks have failed. The FDIC believes U.S. bank failures will cost the deposit insurance fund more than $65 billion over the next four years. The FDIC insures bank accounts for up to $250,000.
