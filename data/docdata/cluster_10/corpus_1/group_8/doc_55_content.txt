An irregularity has been discovered by investment bank Merrill Lynch in its London trading room.  The bank has said a worker in the foreign exchange area has been suspended and the UK markets watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, is investigating possible losses.  Merrill said it discovered the irregularities after reviewing trades the dealer had made.  Merrill was rescued by Bank of America last year after it built up multi-billion-dollar bad debts linked to the US housing market.
