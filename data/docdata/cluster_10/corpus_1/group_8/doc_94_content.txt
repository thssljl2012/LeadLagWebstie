March 3 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co generated $5 billion in profit during the worst year in Wall Street history by trading over-the-counter fixed-income derivatives, Bloomberg said, citing two people with knowledge of the results.   The bank, which reported $5.6 billion of total profit in 2008, has not disclosed earnings for its interest-rate swap, municipal bond and foreign exchange derivatives group, the agency said. The unit was among the most profitable at the New York-based company, it added.   The JPMorgan trading desk may have benefited as the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and JPMorgan's takeover of Bear Stearns Cos left companies and hedge funds with fewer trading partners in the private derivatives markets, the agency said.   Among commercial lenders, JPMorgan dominates OTC derivatives trading, the agency said, citing data compiled by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.   The bank held $87.7 trillion worth of outstanding OTC contracts as of Sept. 30, more than the next two banks, Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc, combined, the agency reported.   JPMorgan could not be immediately reached by Reuters for comment.
