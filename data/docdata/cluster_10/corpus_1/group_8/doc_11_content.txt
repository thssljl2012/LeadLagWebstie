Beneficiaries of bail-out funds from the firm number some two dozen, including the Goldman Sachs group and Germany's Deutsche Bank AG, the paper said.  Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank each received some 6 billion dollars in payments between September and December 2008, to cover exposures they had at the failing insurer.  The names of all AIG's derivative counterparties and the amount of taxpayer money they have received is still not known, but political pressure is mounting for disclosure.  Other firms that have received funds through the bail-out include Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland, and HSBC.
