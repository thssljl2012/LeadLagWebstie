The federal bailout of insurance giant American International Group has benefited at least two dozen U.S. and foreign financial institutions that collected some $50 billion, according to media reports yesterday.  AIG - once the world's largest insurer - is paying money to its counterparties because it had agreed to guarantee them against losses from credit default swaps they had invested in.  Citing a confidential document and people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal said recipients of AIG money include Goldman Sachs and Germany's Deutsche Bank, each of which received roughly $6 billion in payments between mid-September and December 2008.  Also receiving AIG money last year were Merrill Lynch, now part of Bank of America, French bank Societe Generale and, to a lesser extent, Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC Holdings, the newspaper said.
