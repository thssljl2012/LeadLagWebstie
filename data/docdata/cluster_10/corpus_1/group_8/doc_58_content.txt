 reports: The New York Times reports that Bank of America's risk team was forced to swing into action after irregularities were discovered in the trading account of a London-based currency trader.  The newspaper reports that the bank found the irregularities some 3 weeks ago when the trader, identified by the Times as Alexis Stenfors (although Bank of America has not yet confirmed his identity), was away on holiday. Stenfors, 38, is believed to have been suspended pending the completion of an ongoing investigation, and is said to be cooperating as the inquiry proceeds. The trader, who told The New York Times that the matter was a 'misunderstanding', is thought to have sustained losses of up to $120m, although Bank of America's senior management have confirmed that the risks are under control. Stenfors is believed to have bagged a decent bonus in 2008, after apparently reaping profits of some $120m (Hmmm).
