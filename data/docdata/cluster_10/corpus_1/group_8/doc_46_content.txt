Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc., which was recently acquired by Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America Corp., will pay $7 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges it gave day traders improper access to confidential information.  According to the SEC, the information was broadcast on squawk boxes, which are internal intercom systems used by broker-dealers to broadcast order information to traders.  The SEC said from 2002 to 2004, several Merrill Lynch retail brokers permitted day traders at other firms to listen to confidential information on large unexecuted block orders of Merrill Lynchs institutional customers.  The Merrill Lynch brokers put their telephones next to the squawk boxes and let the day traders listen, often for the entire trading day, the SEC said.  The day traders used the broadcasts to trade ahead of the orders placed by Merrill Lynchs customers, the SEC said. The firm lacked written policies or procedures to limit which employees within the firm had access to the equity squawk box, to track which employees had access, or to monitor employees for possible misuse of the order information, said Kay Lackey, associate regional director of the SECs New York regional office. This created conditions that rogue brokers could exploit, as happened here. Merrill didnt admit or deny the SECs allegations. The company agreed to various procedures aimed at protecting customer order information transmitted on the squawk boxes and related technologies.  BofA (NYSE: BAC) bought Merrill Lynch on Jan. 1 for $29.1 billion, including $8.6 billion in preferred stock.
