New York states top legal officer issued subpoenas on Wednesday to seven executives who received tens of millions of dollars in 2008 pay from Merrill By Reuters March 05, 2009 NEW YORK, March 4 - New York state's top legal officer issued subpoenas on Wednesday to seven executives who received tens of millions of dollars in 2008 pay from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. before it was taken over by Bank of America Corp., a person familiar with the investigation said.  Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is seeking information from the executives, top earners at Merrill even as its net loss swelled last year to $27.6 billion.  Last month, Cuomo's lawyers took testimony under oath from former Merrill head John Thain and Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis, part of a probe into whether the firm broke securities laws on public disclosure of executive compensation.
