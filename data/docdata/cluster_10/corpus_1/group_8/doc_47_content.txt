New York investigators looking into pay at Merrill Lynch (NYSE:MER) are examining the possibility that bonuses were used to downgrade traders' portfolios, sources said.  New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has been investigating the $3.6 billion in bonus pay Merrill Lynch awarded employees just before it was sold to Bank Of America. But the point of contention, so far, has been the extravagant amounts paid in bonuses after the banks had accepted billions of dollars in emergency funds from the government.  However, the Financial Times reported Wednesday that the probe is also looking into the massive bonus awards as part of a 'kitchen sink' maneuver, by which traders downgrade their position with a firm in order to post gains later -- in this case, in early January at the start of a new year.  Three former Merrill Lynch executives told the Times that traders had adjusted their positions in late December, but the markdowns were not large enough to constitute a 'concerted effort' to manipulate the market.  In the bonus probe, Cuomo has accused Bank of America of shielding information regarding the use of taxpayer funding.  The bank has said it is protecting its employees' right to privacy. (c) UPI
