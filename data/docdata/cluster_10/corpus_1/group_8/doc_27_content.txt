Investment bank Merrill Lynch is poring over the books of currency traders after an 'irregularity' was found within its trading operation in London.  The bank, now owned by Bank of America, has informed regulators and is working with authorities.  The announcement follows a report in the New York Times that attention was focused on the accounts of Alexis Stenfors, a foreign exchange trader.  H  is losses, when they came to light, were said to have so alarmed management at Bank of America that they examined the books of other traders who were on holiday.  Mr Stenfors recorded a trading profit for the year of about 85 million, according to the New York Times, which quoted him as calling the issue a 'misunderstanding'.  But according to the Financial Times, he has been suspended after racking up more than 284 million in undisclosed losses in recent months.  Neighbours of a house in Mercers Road, Holloway, north London, said Mr Stenfors was a banker and 'a family man' who lived with his two young children.  One said he often visited Sweden and had a nanny who helped look after his children.  A Merrill Lynch spokesman said: 'During a recent evaluation of certain trading positions, we discovered an irregularity.  'We informed regulators immediately and are working closely with authorities to thoroughly investigate the matter.'  Copyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2009, All Rights Reserved.
