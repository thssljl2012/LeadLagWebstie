A top US lawmaker and New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo on Monday demanded that Bank of America disclose details about any 2008 bonuses of more than one million dollars paid to its employees or those of Merrill Lynch. 'Your refusal to reveal compensation information fuels distrust and cynicism at a most sensitive time,' Cuomo and Democratic Representative Barney Frank warned in a joint letter to Bank of America chief executive officer Ken Lewis.  Frank, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, and Cuomo noted that Merrill Lynch paid out about 3.6 billion dollars while Bank of America gave about 3.3 billion dollars.   Bank of America swallowed up Merrill Lynch on January 1 and recently asked a New York state court to keep its pay data confidential at a time when a painful recession has fueled public anger at executive compensation.   Frank and Cuomo said in their letter that the public was entitled to the information because Bank of America has received about 45 billion dollars of a Wall Street rescue package. 'Taxpayers who are footing the bill obviously demand accountability and want to know who received these funds and why,' they said.
