 A judge said Friday he will decide within a week whether Bank of America Corp. has to turn over a list of performance bonuses given to the 200 highest paid employees of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.  State Supreme Court Justice Bernard Fried didn't indicate how he would rule, but during the court hearing he questioned Bank of America's claim that salary information was a trade secret and suggested he was unlikely to order confidentiality merely to save Merrill Lynch workers from a public shaming. He said he planned on issuing a decision by next Friday.
