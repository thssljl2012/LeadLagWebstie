  NEW YORK -- In the end, congressional approval of the government's $700 billion financial rescue plan Friday did little to lift the financial markets from their growing dejection over the obstacles still facing the economy. Wall Street ended an intensely volatile week with the Dow Jones industrials falling 157 points and the major indexes all suffering big losses. The credit markets remained stagnant, with no immediate signs of when lending and borrowing would return to levels even approaching normalcy. Investors had been anxious for resolution on the government's plan to buy up bad assets from banks and other institutions to shore up the financial industry and help resuscitate credit markets. But Wall Street has come to realize passage of the plan is not a quick fix. 'We're three weeks into a severe credit crunch and it's causing untold economic damage to the country,' said Hank Smith, chief investment officer at Haverford Investments. He said while the bill's passage will help Wall Street, the broader effects of the paralysis in the credit markets have yet to emerge. 'It's fairly reasonable to assume that this should help unfreeze the credit markets but what we don't know is what's happened so far. How much of a dent has it put into the economy?' The credit markets indicated increased demand for safety. The yield on the three-month Treasury bill, the safest type of investment, fell to 0.50 percent from 0.70 percent late Thursday. AdvertisementYields have remained low in recent weeks because investors are eager to safeguard their money. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves opposite its price, rose to 3.60 percent from 3.64 percent late Thursday. The Dow fell 157.47 to 10,325.38. The Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor's 500 index fell 15.05 to 1,099.23, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 29.33 to 1,947.39. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 18.27 to 619.40. For the week, the Dow lost 7.34 percent -- its worst weekly loss since July 2002. Meanwhile, the S&amp;amp;amp;P 500 fell 10.8 percent for the week and the Nasdaq declined 9.38 percent. The Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 Composite Index, which measures 5,000 U.S. based companies' stocks, saw an estimated paper loss of about $1.5 trillion for the week, the worst weekly return since the week after trading resumed following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. The dollar slipped against most other major currencies, while gold prices fell. Light, sweet crude fell 9 cents to settle at $93.88 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The insurer American International Group Inc., which took an $85 billion loan from the government last month, said Friday it plans to sell off a number of business units to pay off the loan. The announcement was expected by Wall Street. But it now leaves investors wondering how much AIG will be able to raise from the sales. AIG, one of the world's biggest insurers, Friday didn't specifically disclose all the assets it would sell or the expected prices from the sales. However, the New York-based insurer said it plans to retain its U.S. property and casualty and foreign general insurance businesses, and also plans to retain an ownership interest in its foreign life insurance operations. AIG shares fell 14 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $3.86.
