An unprecedented amount of banking consolidation triggered by the credit crunch  to $2,810bn in the first nine months of the year, although it was not enough to prevent a 24% fall in global M&amp;amp;A. The value of deals among financial institutions in the third quarter reached $132.8bn, accounting for 50% of the years global banking M&amp;amp;A volume, according to Dealogic. From now into 2009, M&amp;amp;A volumes are likely to be led by continued consolidation in the banking sector, said M&amp;amp;A experts. In Q3, banking M&amp;amp;A alone accounted for 15% of all deals  up from 8% in the second quarter, largely due to two deals: Bank of Americas $44.4bn acquisition of Merrill Lynch and Lloyds TSBs $21.9bn takeover of HBOS. Leading the M&amp;amp;A league tables for the nine months through September are: Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Citigroup. Separately,  how paralysis in the lending market is threatening some of the worlds biggest potential takeovers.
