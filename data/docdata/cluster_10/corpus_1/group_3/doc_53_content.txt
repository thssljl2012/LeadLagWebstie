Whilst RBS and HBOS, the main beneficiaries, have been higher this morning, other banking stocks - HSBC and Barclays - have been hit hard as investors pull out their money from now part-nationalised institutions. Clarity has been the watchword of recent weeks, but has remained wholly elusive. It is still not completely clear as to where we stand following the governments pledge to use tax payers money to bail out the UK banks and, throughout this morning, negotiations will be ongoing to see just exactly how much of our own money is required to insure the safety of our own savings. Its ironic that we are now paying our own banks to look after our money when really its probably better off being stuffed under the mattress. We are still looking at a recession that could be much deeper than previously imagined and, as a result, all the other constituents of the FTSE 100 are being aggressively sold off. Pension funds, insurance companies and fund managers are rushing to close positions as things get seriously messy - not just for banking stocks, but all sectors. The audible clamour is the sound of investors are running for the hills. Simon Denham is the founder of spread-betting firm Capital Spreads.
