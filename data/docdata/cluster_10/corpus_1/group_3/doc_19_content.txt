A fresh shockwave from the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers could hit home on Tuesday when complex insurance contracts worth hundreds of billions are settled, it was reported.Around 360 billion US dollars (208bn) in so-called credit default swap (CDS) contracts are due to be paid off following the company's failure.A CDS essentially acts like an insurance policy against defaults on corporate bonds or loans.It is a form of derivative contract, gaining a 'derived' value from the performance of the bond it is based on.But because Lehman went bust, those selling CDSs to insure against default on its corporate bonds will be forced to stump up the cash to buyers.Tuesday is the D-Day for the complex web of transactions. A City source told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Everyone will be watching the situation and wondering what's going to happen.'AIG, the insurance giant which was one of the biggest sellers of CDS products, is thought to have large exposure to Lehman Brothers and was bailed out by the US Government last month.The Treasury has pumped in more than 120 billion US dollars (70bn) into the stricken firm so far.Other insurers of Lehman's debt are thought to be hedge funds, who created and sold CDSs as a lucrative revenue-raising exercise in better times.Although CDSs were originally designed as insurance products to allow investors to hedge against the risk of default, traders have also used them as speculative tools.
