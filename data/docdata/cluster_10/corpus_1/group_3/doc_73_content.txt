What's in it for Main Street?  It's been a tough sell to convince angry critics of the proposed $700-billion bailout that Joanie Paycheck would get anything out of this deal.But Michigan's treasurer told me that a deal must get done soon to prevent a serious recession in the United States -- and even worse fallout in Michigan.Higher unemployment Thought a nearly 800-point one-day drop on the Dow was scary? Here's another ugly number: If nothing is done, Treasurer Robert J. Kleine said Michigan's jobless rate could easily climb above 10%.The state's jobless rate hit 8.9% in August.'It's not a bailout of Wall Street -- it's not a bailout at all. It's a rescue plan for the economy,' Kleine said.Kleine spoke to me at length Tuesday, a day after the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 777.68 points -- or nearly 7% -- on news that the House of Representatives defeated the historic rescue package.The Dow snapped back Tuesday on hopes that lawmakers could rescue the rescue. It gained 485.21 points, up 4.7%, to close at 10,850.66.Kleine said if credit markets freeze up and banks aren't able to lend, a number of bad things could happen: small businesses will be unable to borrow, consumers will find it hard to get car loans, students may find it tough to get student loans, getting a mortgage would be difficult -- and ultimately people would lose jobs.'It's going to result in a very serious recession,' Kleine said.Maybe something like the slump in the early 1980s.Bad news for pension funds Like the rest of us, Michigan's state pension funds lost money in the latest crisis. In the meltdown Monday, the state's pension funds lost $2.3 billion, Kleine said.A chunk of that money was being recovered Tuesday.The State of Michigan manages more than $55 billion in retirement funds for teachers, state troopers, public employees and judges.The collapse of insurance industry giant AIG cost the funds about $70 million.From a year ago, the pension funds are down about 12%, or $8.3 billion. 'The stock market is an important factor. The more important factor is when people start to lose jobs -- and can't borrow money,' Kleine said.He said borrowing costs are already going up.The State of Michigan and related authorities have about $700 million in variable rate bonds outstanding to cover various programs, he said. Less than half of that outstanding amount is in general obligation bonds.The interest rate has gone up from the 3% to 4% range to an 8% to 10% range.If rates stayed so high for a year -- not expected at this point -- he said the borrowing cost would jump by $35 million or $40 million.Local governments, he predicted, would face those serious problems, too. It's too serious of a problem, he said, to simply let financial companies fail.'It's nice to say, 'Let's punish them and let them all fail,' ' Kleine said.But he suggests that Main Street will be even angrier if nothing is done and even more people lose jobs.Contact SUSAN TOMPOR at 313-222-8876 or stompor@freepress.com.
