NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Investors who wagered that Washington Mutual would somehow survive the latest market turmoil may not have to pay as dearly as some had feared.Based on preliminary results of an auction held Thursday, investors who sold default protection on the now-defunct savings and loan will recover 63.625 cents on the dollar, according to Creditfixings.com, suggesting a loss of just over 36%.Final results of the auction will be released later Thursday afternoon and it's possible that the actual settlement will be lower.Brian Yelvington, an analyst with research firm CreditSights, said that the preliminary results from the WaMu were an encouraging sign for sellers.'The initial auction results are not too far off from where [WaMu] bonds were trading in the open market yesterday. The auction mechanism appears to be working well,' he said.The WaMu auction represents the latest peek at the long-ignored market for credit default swaps, which some estimate to be worth $55 trillion.Bondholders, as well as other investors, sometimes purchase these complex financial instruments as a form of insurance to protect against a company defaulting on its debt or going bankrupt.Investors around the world paid a lot of attention to a similar auction for Lehman Brothers on October 10 since it represented an important test of the largely unregulated credit default swap market.Sellers of the company's credit default swaps recouped just 8.625 cents on the dollar, representing a loss of more than 91% on these contracts.Stocks were whipsawed that day and some traders blamed concerns about the auction and the impact it would have on many already struggling banks for much of the volatility that day.Buyers and sellers of Lehman credit default swaps managed to settle those claims earlier this week without any major fallout amongst financial institutions or the broader market, which many feared could happen.Some $5.2 billion is expected to trade hands between investors that bet on a Lehman default, according to the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which handles trades in over-the-counter markets such as credit default swaps.Over 500 parties participated in Thursday's WaMu auction, including major global financial institutions such as Bank of America (BAC, Fortune 500), Barclays (BCS), Citigroup (C, Fortune 500) and Goldman Sachs (GS, Fortune 500).That number dwarfed the more than 350 banks and investors that took part in Lehman's auction. What remains unclear is whether the payments related to the WaMu's credit default swaps will surpass that of Lehman.Yet in some ways, Thursday's auction brings the WaMu tale one step closer to the end.Saddled by toxic home loans, WaMu struggled for months and tried numerous remedies to shore up its problems, including a $7 billion private equity investment and the expulsion of long-time CEO Kerry Killinger.But fallout in the U.S. mortgage market and waning confidence in the company proved too much for the Seattle-based thrift.Washington Mutual (WM, Fortune 500) collapsed on Sept. 29, making it the biggest bank failure in the nation's history. Federal regulators seized the company's banking operations, only to turn around and sell them to JPMorgan Chase (JPM, Fortune 500) for $1.9 billion.First Published: October 23, 2008: 11:04 AM ET
