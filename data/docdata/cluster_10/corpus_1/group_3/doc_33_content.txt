Wachovia Corp. shareholders are breathing a sigh of relief over the Wells Fargo &amp;amp; Co. merger announced Friday morning, and so are some employees.UNC Charlotte professor of finance Tony Plath says the Wells combination is a better deal for everybody, including employees at the Charlotte-based bank. Its 100% better, he says. Because Wells (NYSE:WFC) will be basing its East Coast retail and commercial and corporate banking businesses in Charlotte, Plath believes that will mean fewer layoffs for Wachovia than the deal proposed Monday by Citigroup Inc.Wachovia (NYSE:WB) is the citys second largest employer. It has 20,000 employees here, including about 10,000 at its customer information center in University City, which hosts customer service, operations and information technology jobs.Because San Francisco-based Wells has so few operations on the East Coast, Plath expects the company to keep much of Wachovias infrastructure here. The manner in which this is structured, where youve got almost a dual headquarters, is good from an infrastructure standpoint for Charlotte, he says. Jason Goldberg, a Barclays Capital bank analyst, also sees benefits to Wells. Bottom line, our initial take is this is an attractive transaction for Wells Fargo as it extends its banking franchise into the East Coast, adding new markets to leverage its cross-sell prowess. The combined company will be No. 1 in deposit market share in 17 of its 39 states, including North Carolina. About 93 percent of its deposits will be in states in which it ranks No. 1, 2 or 3.
