 Acting swiftly &amp;amp; Mr Paulson leaves after answering questions at a news conference in Washington.     Anne Davies October 10, 2008 THE US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, has convened a special meeting of the G20, comprised of the world's 20 largest economies including , in Washington this weekend, as US authorities injected another $US38 billion ($55 billion) into the toppling insurance group AIG to keep it afloat. The n Treasurer, Wayne Swan, along with many other finance ministers, will be in Washington for the International Monetary Fund meetings. The G20 meeting is expected to take place on Saturday and will look at ways to urgently co-ordinate stabilisation measures in the markets.Further evidence of the extreme fragility of the markets came on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve announced it would pump the extra money into AIG, on top of the $US85 billion it has already injected into America's largest insurer, and the Dow yo-yoed through a 300-point range, closing down 191 despite a 0.5 percentage point cut in US and European interest rates.In Washington Mr Paulson held a press conference to reassure the markets that he was acting swiftly to put the mechanics in place so Treasury can start using the $US700 billion rescue package approved by Congress last week.Significantly he pointed to his power to inject capital into financial institutions, listing it ahead of the two other powers - to purchase troubled assets, and to insure mortgage-backed securities."The act adds broad flexible authorities to buy or insure troubled assets, provide guarantees and inject capital," he said. "We will use all the tools we've been given to maximum effectiveness, including the capitalisation of financial institutions of every size," he said.Two hours later the Fed announced the additional injection into AIG.There has been a raging debate between economists in the US whether it is better to buy up troubled assets by way of the reverse auction process first proposed by Mr Paulson, or whether the real issue now is solvency, which would require injections of capital.Although Treasury has been working hard on setting up an auction process, Mr Paulson admitted it would be several weeks before it could make its first purchase."We will implement our new authorities with one simple goal: to restore capital flows to the consumers and businesses that form the core of our economy," he said.But the latest injection of funds into AIG is bringing howls from politicians after senior executives confirmed the company's US life insurance arm had spent $US440,000 on a weekend retreat for senior staff, including spa treatments, just after receiving the first injection of taxpayer funds.AIG issued a statement on Wednesday saying that the "business event" was planned months before the September 16 bail-out and that it was held for top-producing independent life insurance agents, not AIG employees.Of the 100 who attended, only 10 worked for the AIG unit hosting the event, it said.     : send photos, videos &amp;amp; tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or  us.
