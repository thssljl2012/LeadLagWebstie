Meanwhile, Lehman will seek early approval of a proposal to sell its Neuberger Berman money management business. Those and other motions are on the agenda for a hearing scheduled at 11 a.m. at bankruptcy court in Lower Manhattan. A number of investment funds using the Harbinger name - which said they are owed more than $250 million - have asked for the right to depose Lehman's Chief Financial Officer Ian Lowitt and examine internal documents for details about any assets transferred in the month before Lehman filed for bankruptcy. Its Chapter 11 filing on Sept. 15 was the biggest in U.S. history. Harbinger is asking that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck allow the inquiry and has argued in court papers that Lehman has not disclosed any information about cash transfers that may have been made among Lehman operating units ahead of the bankruptcy filing. It said a speedy inquiry was important to preserve the assets. 'This is why information concerning the debtors' cash management and alleged transfers is so vital now,' lawyers wrote. Lehman opposes Harbinger's request and called it 'inappropriate, unjustified and destructive,' in a court filing. Lehman's lawyers argued that Harbinger, and others who have seconded its request, are only trying to get what they're owed without regard for the fact that an investigation could be harmful because of the waste of time. Harbinger has been joined by Well Fargo Bank NA, Newport Global Opportunities Fund LP, Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, Fir Tree Value Master Fund LP and others. Partly at issue in Harbinger's request is $8 billion that Lehman Brothers' European business says was wrongly kept by Lehman's parent company, money the European arm felt should have been sent back the day of the filing. The Bay Harbour hedge fund, which joined in Harbinger's request, argued there has been an 'unprecedented lack of transparency.' 'Creditors and the court are entitled to know the facts,' Bay Harbour lawyers wrote. The judge will consider a request from the administrator of Lehman's insolvency in Europe to have limited oversight of cash management. The European unit wants to ensure that there is a separation between money that is part of the estate under Chapter 11 and money that is not. Lehman is also asking Peck to give preliminary approval to a sale of its investment management business to Bain Capital Partners and Hellman &amp;amp; Friedman for $2.15 billion. The deal includes money management firm Neuberger Berman, a 69-year-old name on Wall Street that now manages more than $130 billion of investments. In addition, Peck will consider motions to approve the proposed sale of natural gas and electricity supplier Eagle Energy Partners to EDF Trading for $230 million. EDF Trading is a unit of one of the biggest electricity businesses in Europe. Eagle owes Lehman about $663.9 million. If the sale is approved, Lehman would forgive about $433 million in outstanding debt under the loan. Also on the agenda are motions to employ Weil, Gotshal &amp;amp; Manges as attorneys for Lehman; Alvarez &amp;amp; Marsal North America LLC for a chief restructuring officer; and Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Col &amp;amp; Mosle LLP as litigation lawyers. Peck will also consider the appointment of an equity committee. A hearing to decide whether a creditors committee can investigate JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co., Lehman's biggest secured creditor, has been postponed. Lehman Brothers entered bankruptcy protection on Sept. 15 with assets of $639 billion and debt of $613 billion. It was forced to file for bankruptcy protection under pressure from the shrinking credit markets and a loss of confidence among investors that it could carry on its day-to-day business. The filing marked the end of what was once the nation's fourth-largest investment bank. In addition to a buyout by Barclays Capital of key U.S. banking units, Lehman has agreed to sell its money management arm, Neuberger Berman, to two private equity firms and its Asian, European and Middle Eastern businesses to Japan's largest brokerage, Nomura Holdings Inc.
