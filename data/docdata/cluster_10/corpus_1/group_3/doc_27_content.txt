One group of investors has not been sweating over the state of their funds as the world's financial markets continue to plumb the depths.They are the investors in the capital-guaranteed investment funds offered by the likes of Liontamer, Man Investments and Savings &amp;amp; Investments. Although the government is building towards guaranteeing deposits in institutions such as banks, building societies, credit unions, and even some finance companies, they will not be the first capital-guaranteed investments on the market.Capital guarantees on funds, which assure investors that they will at least get their money back at the end of a fixed term even if the assets they are invested in tank, have been used in recent years as a way of encouraging nervous investors to invest in growth assets such as international equities, specific share sectors such as water or alternative energy stocks or highly specialised funds such as hedge funds.Usually, the guarantee comes at a cost, and investors have to tie up their capital for a fixed term, though many investors have found the price worth paying in recent years with Liontamer having attracted around $300 million with the launch of its 27 funds, and Man Investments' 32 funds now have $A7 billion in them. Liontamer's Janine Starks said the guarantees are looking like money well spent, as it would be about the only fund manager in the country not engaged in trying to reassure worried investors. 'I can honestly say that I haven't had one client call in the last five months. That just speaks volumes.' Liontamer's funds, which generally provide exposure to the rises in indices of global shares, are designed to ensure investors do not lose capital with a guarantee from AA- rated KBC Bank. But they still need markets to go up for investors to see positive returns.Many of the indices against which the firm's funds track are well down on the date the funds were launched, which means markets need to come back a long way just to take those indices back to their starting levels, a floor from which any further rises would start to generate positive returns.For example, the indices behind the Combi Series 5 Fund (a commodities fund) and the Fallen Angels fund (investing in big shares that had fallen a long way), have both plunged since the funds were launched in July - the Combi index by 17.75% and the Angel index by 16.5% to September 30.Both funds mature in 2011. It's not just the more recently launched funds that need market rises. Market sell-offs have been so severe that even funds launched in 2005 need markets to rise to put them back in positive territory.The group is marketing two new funds - an alternative energy fund and a global shares fund - with a new feature setting the starting value of the index behind each as the lowest price in the first six months of their operation.Starks said that meant if there were any further falls in markets in the first six months after launch, investors wouldn't lose out as a result.Starks is also confident Liontamer will have another fund out before Christmas - this time a fallen angels fund investing in banks that have had their share prices hammered. But while Liontamer's funds have generally offered a simple 100% guarantee, Man Investments' funds have a rising capital guarantee, which each year resets locking in half of the rises the fund has posted in the past year, with the guarantee provided by Commonwealth Bank of Australia. That's kept all but its most recent funds in positive territory.Sam Yates, of Man Investments, says the group has never had to call on one of its capital guarantees, and does not expect to now, even though its funds have lost ground in recent months. Man's funds are invested with two investment managers - one which builds funds of hedge funds and the other which invests in futures - both high-risk forms of investing, but which have been successful over a number of years for the manager.But investors need to be wary of guarantees, as all rely on the strength of the companies providing the guarantees, and the terms of the guarantees not being breached.The liquidators of Capital &amp;amp; Merchant, for example, say the Lloyds of London insurance policies which were supposed to indemnify the company against making losses on loans were invalidated by the actions of the company's directors, while the collapse under a sea of debt of OPI Pacific Finance's parent company Octaviar has substantially undermined the value of the loan guarantees it told investors it had. Savings &amp;amp; Investments' Kauri Notes were guaranteed by Merrill Lynch, a once unassailable giant of finance that came close to going bust, but has been rescued. The guarantee will now be honoured by Merrill's new owner Bank of America.* Retail deposits: The government plans to guarantee deposits at eligible institutions such as banks, building societies, credit unions and finance companies.* Kiwi Bonds: Paying 6% for 12 months, 5.75% for two years. Guaranteed by the government.* Term deposits at Public Trust: Pay a fraction more than Kiwi Bonds, but are also government-guaranteed.* Capital-protected funds: Liontamer, OM-IP and Savings &amp;amp; Investments. * KiwiSaver: Westpac's capital-protected growth fund.
