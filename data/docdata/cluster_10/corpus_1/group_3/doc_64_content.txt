[BRIEFING.COM] Stocks have spiked upward, taking the major indices to their best levels of the morning. Following the prior session's sell off, materials (+4.5%) are showing strength, as is energy (+5.2%). Energy is being helped by a 2.0% gain in the price of oil futures, which are now a bit below $96 per barrel.Financials remain in focus, however. The sector is near its session high, up 3.7%.Shares of insurance giant AIG (AIG 4.76, +0.76) are trading higher after the company announced plans to sell assets and focus efforts on its core property and casualty insurance businesses. The restructuring efforts and asset sales will help raise capital to protect against future losses and repay the $85 billion credit line extended by the Federal Reserve. Moreover, with the company's image tainted, it risks losing some of its best assets as competitors chase customers. Focusing on core assets, like its property and casualty business, will help protect the firm going forward.
