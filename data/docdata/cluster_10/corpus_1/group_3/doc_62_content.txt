 By Matt Andrejczak, MarketWatch Last Update: 12:17 PM ET Oct 27, 2008 SAN FRANCISCO (Menafn - MarketWatch) - Lenders for Pilgrim's Pride Corp., which again Monday gave the company another month to sort out its troubled finances, plan to install a chief restructuring officer at the distressed chicken giant. The move is a sign the banks backing Pilgrim's Pride  are looking to take greater control. The chicken company has been working with investment advisors at Lazard and Bain &amp;amp; Company to improve its cash position, either through asset sales or a recapitalization. In a regulatory filing, Pilgrim's Pride lenders, CoBank and BMO Lending Group, said their temporary waiver "requires the company to engage a chief restructuring officer within 10 business days after the company receives a list of candidates for such a position." Chief restructuring officers are hired to run distressed companies, often in bankruptcy. In recent weeks, American Insurance Group and Washington Mutual hired restructuring officers. AIG has gotten almost $100 billion from the U.S. government to keep it afloat, while WaMu became the biggest U.S. bank failure ever a month ago. Separately, Pilgrim's Pride board also amended the company's executive change-in-control agreements, or golden parachute deals, according to the same Securities and Exchange Commission filing. The pacts cover company chairman Lonnie Ken Pilgrim, CEO Clinton Rivers, COO Robert Wright, and CFO Richard A. Cogdill. "Lenders have been constructive and supportive throughout this challenging period and we believe that like us, they are encouraged by recent industry egg set data and the continued decline in grain and other feed ingredient prices," Pilgrim's Pride said in a statement. A company spokesperson couldn't be reached for further comment. Farha Aslam, poultry analyst at Stephens Inc, said Monday she thinks there is a "70%-80% chance" that Pilgrim's Pride can sell assets to avoid bankruptcy. Crushed by high prices for corn, weak chicken-breast prices, and industry oversupply, Pilgrim's Pride lost $197 million through the nine months ended June 28. And the ongoing global credit crunch is likely to weight further on U.S. chicken producers. On Monday, Aslam also cut her full year profit targets on chicken producers Sanderson Farms  and Tyson Foods . Aslam estimates dark meat prices could drop up to 34% to 35 cents a pound by mid-November as the export market slows and the U.S. dollar gains strength against the Euro and other foreign currencies. She said the U.S. chicken will have to cut production even more. Pilgrim's Pride shares rose 7% to $2.33 in midday trading. The stock is down 92% for the year.     addthis_pub addthis_logo //addthis_logo_background //addthis_logo_color addthis_brand //addthis_options 'favorites, email, digg, delicious, myspace, facebook, google, live,   google_ad_client google_ad_width google_ad_height google_ad_format google_ad_type google_ad_channel google_color_border google_color_bg google_color_link google_color_url google_color_text Most popular stories        (typeof sawsanantondababneh news research economy business finance middle east UAE Saudi arab jordan amman dubai profits libor interest currency dollar euro oil stocks trade        Copyright 2000 All Rights Reserved. for j j++)
