TOKYO - JAPAN'S top broker Nomura Holdings said on Monday that it had agreed to acquire Lehman Brothers' operations in India, giving jobs to 3,000 more workers from the bankrupt Wall Street giant. Nomura, which is already buying Lehman's operations in the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Europe, will take on the failed US bank's India-based back office and IT support businesses for an undisclosed sum. The subsidiaries, based in the financial hub of Mumbai, were not included in the earlier deal because they were under the wing of Lehman's North American business, which is being bought by the British bank Barclays. -- AFP
