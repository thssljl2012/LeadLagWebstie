Barclays Wealth has launched a long-term five-year bond which it is hailing as low-risk alternative to cash investments.  The bond, which offers an interest rate of 5.25 per cent, has been created on the back of the success of the trial of a similar five-year fixed income bond.  The trial product hit its target of making 15 million and has prompted the launch of the latest regular fixed-income bond which hit the market today.  Colin Dickie, director of Barclays Wealth, said: 'The Fixed-Income Bond has been a great success as it differs from most, if not all, products of this type by locking in a high headline income rate for five years.  '[This is] much longer than the high street fixed rate savings bond. It is also very competitive against the rates being offered by Guaranteed Income Bonds over a five-year period.'  The bond is being sold by Barclays Wealth, which is backed by Barclays Bank, via financial advisers. It is not exposed the stock market and offers 100 per cent capital protection on the original investment.
