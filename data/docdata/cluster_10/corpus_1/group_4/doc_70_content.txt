View from the City: Chartists at trading firm Blue Index give argue the case that the next bull market It is said the financial markets are fuelled by two emotions - fear and greed. What we can say with absolute certainty is that we have recently experienced one of the most fraught periods in financial markets in decades. And the latter, fear has been a major factor in most if not all transactions during this time.   But rather than run for the sidelines it is precisely this type of trading environment which offers opportunity. Whether you are a bull looking to buy beaten down blue chips  It may sound strange to suggest that the next bull market has already begun, but this could very well be the case. The simple reason is that sentiment and valuations couldn't really be much lower, and major companies have gone bust effectively bursting the economic bubble we have enjoyed for so long. This also suggests we have now essentially become familiar with the massive extent of the credit crunch meltdown.   In our view, the FTSE 100  True, they may be broken if the doomsters are correct, but there could be rebounds of 20% or more for indices, leading to 50% rises for individual stocks.   The final week of October was a great example of such an opportunity - the month as a whole was the worst in 21 years but there was a rise from an intraday low on October 27th of 3,655 to 4,377. That there could be a 'final' low in the bear market  EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT INVESTING Market dataGet up to the minute info on the markets   Gold  Live data: Latest gold price and charts   Oil  Live data: Latest oil price and historic charts   Banks  Keep up to date with latest bank share data   Share dealing  Buy and sell shares with The Share Centre   Company A-Z  Data, news, comparison tables and more   Winners  The top five crunch-defying stocks   FTSE 100  Detailed price data at your fingertips   Top movers  Chart your company's performance Calculate how fund fees affect your returns   Commentary  Opinion and analysis from our columnists Discuss investing on our message board  The story so far   The state of the financial market has become the subject of every day conversation, with hardly any area in this field left untouched. The question to be asked now is whether after over a year of unravelling, the boom of the first part of this decade has finally been unwound? In terms of sheer value destruction this may be the case. We have said goodbye to countless big-name banks and financial institutions, had near misses with many more, and are now threatening to see countries go bust, led by Iceland.   Against the value that has been destroyed, with many leading indices down a third this year or more, we have seen Governments start to intervene in an unprecedented way in order to try and arrest the slide into recession. Just as unprecedented is the way that those who govern are concerned that the credit crunch doesn't bite too hard. Previous downturns in the 1990's and 1980's provided bitter pill solutions of higher interest rates and tighter monetary policy, but on this occasion we appear to have exactly the opposite, with interest rates that could fall near to zero, plus a binge of spending on behalf of the taxpayer.   The logic is that it would be cheaper to bail out companies before they fall rather than pick up the pieces, but it isn't yet clear where the end game with the blank cheque approach lies apart from the irony of capitalist countries adopting socialist/communist methods to stabilise their economies.   A banking certainty   October 2008 is likely to be seen as the turning point, even if it doesn't mark the end of the crunch. The reason for this is that after over a year of financial uncertainty governments around the world have taken measures to bolster confidence, with a round of interest rate cuts which could eventually see levels approach the 0% level if necessary. Perhaps the most important and dramatic measures apart from the $700bn bailout in the US and 500bn in the UK  echoed by other countries, has been the guarantee of bank deposits.   Recently, for a time it seemed the general public were forced to consider what type of mattress to place their cash under, rather than which bank. However, this issue has now been addressed and a major cause of concern has been alleviated. The stock market cannot escape its bear market until the fate of the banks has been clarified, and in this we now appear to have had closure on this issue. The fate of banks such as HBOS  This report is written by Blue Index: Choosing the stocks   The stocks that follow have been chosen with two main considerations.

However, there is little doubt that the group has secured its future in a way that other banks can only dream of, and clearly shows the bank will have the resources to be able to acquire weaker rivals and/or their businesses if the opportunities arise. There is an opportunity to bottom fish the shares towards the 153p effective funding price, something that would effectively mean buying the shares at 1995 levels.
