 The number of job openings posted online in October kept falling in New Jersey and other finance-dependent states, but stabilized nationwide, suggesting the finance industry hasn't hit bottom yet, according to the Conference Board.New Jersey's online job postings fell 7.7 percent from September to October; New York declined 10.3 percent, California fell 23.8 percent and Illinois dropped 7.9 percent. Most states showed modest gains or losses in online job volume."The October labor-demand data show losses in the financial sector, but the greater impact will likely be in the November numbers," said Gad Levanon, senior economist at the Conference Board. "We are likely to see more widespread deterioration in labor demand over the coming months."One example may be Barclays Capital, which is acquiring much of Lehman Brothers' operations and has disclosed plans to cut 710 New Jersey jobs by Dec. 26.   New Jersey has lost 9,000 jobs in the financial sector in the nine months through September, dropping that sector to a total of 264,300 jobs, according to the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development.  88 people have read this article.
