vox_mundi writes:   (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. plummeted as much as 31 percent and moved toward its lowest level in 62 years after a Deutsche Bank AG analyst downgraded the shares, saying they may be worthless in a year. ''Even if GM succeeds in averting a bankruptcy, we believe that the company's future path is likely to be bankruptcy-like,'' Deutsche Bank's Rod Lache wrote today in a note. The New York analyst recommended selling the shares and cut his 12-month price target to zero. He previously advised holding the stock. The decline shows mounting pessimism that a turnaround will succeed at the largest U.S. automaker amid the credit crisis and the worst sales market in at least 15 years. GM is petitioning the U.S. government for aid after saying last week it may not have enough cash to operate this year. A bankruptcy typically wipes out the value of a company's shares. Barclays Capital and Buckingham Research Group cut their price targets for GM to $1. Bloomberg
