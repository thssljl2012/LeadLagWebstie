Pilgrim's Pride Corp. has been sued on behalf of investors claiming the Pittsburg-based chicken producer misrepresented its financial condition and concealed its capital problems, a San Diego law firm said Thursday.  The lawsuit named Ronald Acaldo as the plaintiff, saying he bought the stock between May 5 and Sept. 24, according to wire reports. However, the document said the lawsuit was filed on behalf of any investors who bought the shares during that period. 'Due to defendants' positive, but false, statements, Pilgrim's Pride's stock closed as high as $26.85 per share in late May 2008,' said the statement from the law firm of Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman and Robbins. A spokesman for the law firm, based in San Diego, said the lawsuit had been filed Wednesday.  The Hartford, Conn.-based law firm of Izard Nobel announced late Thursday it also is planning a class action lawsuit against Pilgrim's Pride. The firm said it has not filed a lawsuit.  A Pilgrim's Pride spokesman said the company does not comment on 'pending or threatened litigation.' The lawsuit by the California firm was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. It claims the company knew but did not disclose that its financial results were 'continuing to deteriorate.' The company's shares traded less than $1 on Thursday, a day after a research report from CreditSights said there was a high probability the chicken producer would file for bankruptcy protection in December.  In mid-day trading Friday, shares were up about 12 percent at $1.11. Pilgrim's shares have traded between a low of 83 cents to a high of $29.59 during the past year.  The stock price low point was reached Thursday before the price ended at 99 cents a share by the end of trading Thursday.  In late September, Pilgrim's warned it expected to report a significant loss and that it could default on a credit covenant as a result. It has since received two temporary waivers from its lenders. 'With the news of Pilgrim's Pride's significant losses, its shares fell to $3.84 per share on September 25, 2008 from $10.26 per share on September 23, 2008, and from the company's Class Period high of $26.85 per share in late May 2008,' the San Diego law firm said in its statement.  Pilgrim's Pride has lost money for nearly a year because of higher costs for feed and fuel, debt obligations, low meat prices and losses on grain hedges.  An independent research firm Friday morning said bankruptcy for the nation's largest chicken producer, Pilgrim's Pride, is 'highly probable.' The East Texas-based company \ whose margins have been hammered by high input costs and weak demand \ also said it will exercise its 30-day grace period in making a $25.7 million interest payment due Nov. 3 on its senior notes.  When that grace period runs out, 'a bankruptcy scenario now seems highly probable,' according to research firm CreditSights. The firm said in a note Wednesday that though the company was able to secure a second temporary waiver, it does little good. 'Although the temporary waiver provides Pilgrim's Pride with another 30 days of life, it appears to be more illusionary than substantive,' the report said. Pilgrim's Pride spokesman Ray Atkinson said the company continues 'to believe Chapter 11 is not in anyone's best interest.' 'We are continuing to work toward a long-term solution to improve our liquidity and to capitalize on our strategic advantages,' he wrote in an e-mail.  Atkinson said CreditSights never contacted the company for comment for its report.  Analysts have been speculating about the probability of bankruptcy for Pilgrim's Pride, though none have been as emphatic as CreditSights, according to wire reports.  Barclays Capital analyst Christopher Bledsoe said last week he thought it unlikely that Pilgrim's Pride's lenders would encourage it to seek bankruptcy protection because much of the industry is hurting.  He said if that happened, the company would have to sell its assets, including chicken products. That would then flood the market\ which the industry is already trying to avoid \ and push prices downward for everyone, including competitors. Banks wouldn't like that because they are lending to companies throughout the industry, so it would just hurt their other customers, he said.  The company carries a large debt load primarily from its $1.3 billion acquisition of rival Gold Kist in early 2007, which made Pilgrim's the nation's biggest chicken producer, just edging out rival Tyson Foods Inc.  The company has said it is working toward a restructuring and addressing industry woes.
