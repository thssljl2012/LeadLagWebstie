But given the huge public resistance to large compensation packages, the Journal reports, Merrills board is reluctant to give Thain a large payout.  According to the Journal, Thain has said he deserves the bonus for steering Merrill through rough waters this year. Though the company has lost more than $10 billion in 2008, Merrill is still standing unlike other Wall Street pillars such as Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns.  And Thain was able to engineer Merrills acquisition by Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), the Charlotte giant thats the No. 4 bank in the Triangle by market share. Shareholders approved the BofA-Merrill deal Dec. 5, and the acquisition is expected to close by the end of the year.  The Journal says that Thain is scheduled to meet with the compensation committee of Merrills board Monday to discuss his request.
