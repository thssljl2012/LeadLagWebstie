Freddie Mac: $100 billion  Wall Street: $700 billion - includes Bank of America (Merrill Lynch), Citigroup, JP Morgan (Washington Mutual), Wells Fargo (Wachovia), Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs etc. As well as $45 billion for Citigroup there's a $306 billion guarantee of bad loans and $800 billion to buy mortgages issued or backed by Fannie, Freddie and others.  Car industry: $200 billion  IndyMac: $8 billion  Stimulus package announced January: $700 billion to $1 trillion  Money market funds: $50 billion  Lehman Brothers (via JP Morgan, post Lehman insolvency): $138 billion  Currency swaps from the Federal Reserve: $620 billion  That's almost $3.652 trillion. Then the Government committed to two new loan programs a fortnight ago worth $US800 billion which, on Forbes accounting, brings the imperial sum of $US8.5 trillion in cumulative commitments, or 60% of the country's forecast GDP.  Some $US3.2 trillion of the $US8.5 trillion has been tapped so far, says Forbes.  Of the $US8.5 trillion, some $US5.5 trillion came from the Fed as its balance sheet expanded exponentially through-out the year - and with little in the way of disclosure. Even Bloomberg was rudely rebuffed on its Freedom of Information requests when it sought to find out what sort of securities the central bank was accepting in return of trillions of dollars in taxpayers' money. (The fact that the Fed is owned, not by the Government but by a bunch of member banks is now dawning, and spawning increasing numbers of sceptics.)  Soaring deficit  The US economy is enormous and on a normal growth trajectory could probably absorb losses and taxpayer bail-outs of such dimensions. What makes it tricky however is the severity of the downturn. The stock market is already off 50%, the housing market down 25% and falling, and then there is the sheer size of the spending which has been sapped from the economy.  Americans helped themselves to $US800 billion a year in home equity withdrawals at the height of the boom. Savings had been extinguished. Add these factors to the money taken out of the consumer economy and on Goldman's reckonings the US Government would have to spend $US2.2 trillion more each year to fill the void. That suggests the deficit could run as high as $US2.7 trillion said a report.
