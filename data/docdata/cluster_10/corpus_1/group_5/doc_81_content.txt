ONeal, Thains predecessor, realized earlier than his peers that U.S. securities firms couldnt survive on their own. He discussed a merger with Bank of America in mid-2007, according to two people familiar with the matter, and he was fired for trying to negotiate a merger with Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia Corp. without prior permission from the Merrill board.  Thain didnt do what he was hired to do, which was to save Merrill Lynch, Hintz said. If the board had wanted to sell the firm, they could have gotten ONeal to do that.
