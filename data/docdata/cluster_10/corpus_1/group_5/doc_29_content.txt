Washington, Dec. 25 (Reuters): GMAC LLC won Feds approval on Wednesday to become a bank holding company, giving it access to the government lending programmes and helping it stave off bankruptcy.  The Federal Reserves approval should allow GMAC to continue financing loans for General Motors.  GM chief executive Rick Wagoner said last week that GMACs difficulties were hammering the auto makers ability to sell cars.  In light of the unusual and exigent circumstances affecting the financial markets ... the board has determined that emergency conditions exist that justify expeditious action on this proposal, the Fed said in a statement.  Analysts said earlier this month that without bank holding status, GMAC could have trouble staying solvent.  But bank status comes at a cost for GMACs majority owner Cerberus and its minority owner GM. Both must cut their stakes in the finance company to comply with the US bank regulations that prevent some companies from owning too big a share of a bank.
