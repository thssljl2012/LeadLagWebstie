NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp said on Thursday it plans to eliminate 30,000 to 35,000 jobs over three years, reflecting its pending purchase of Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co and weaker business activity stemming from the economic recession.  The cuts could affect as much as 11.4 percent of the combined companies' workforce of about 308,000 people, and are intended to help save $7 billion of annual costs.  Bank of America said the cuts will come from both companies and affect all business lines, and in part reflect 'the weak economic environment, which is affecting the level of business activity.' The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said it won't determine the final number of cuts until early 2009, and that as many as possible will come through attrition.  Bank of America employs about 247,000 people and Merrill about 61,000. The merger values Merrill at about $20.5 billion and is expected to close on Jan. 1, 2009, creating the largest U.S. bank by assets.  Financial companies have announced more than 250,000 job cuts this year, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp;amp; Christmas Inc, as losses soared from mortgages, credit cards and securities writedowns.  Bank of America announced its cuts less than four weeks after Citigroup Inc set plans to eliminate 52,000 jobs, or 15 percent of its workforce, by early 2009. 'If you asked me six months ago I would be surprised, but in this day and age, it doesn't look as draconian, especially compared with what Citigroup did,' said Howard Diamond, chief executive of Diamond Consultants, a Chester, New Jersey, recruiter.
