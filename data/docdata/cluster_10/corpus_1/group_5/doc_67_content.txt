HONG KONG -(Dow Jones)- UBS AG (UBS) had sought to sell US$3.1 billion worth of China Construction Bank Corp. (0939.HK) shares owned by Bank of America Corp. (BAC) over the weekend, but the deal was canceled Monday, people familiar with the situation told Dow Jones Newswires on Tuesday.  On Monday, Hong Kong's Chinese-language Apple Daily newspaper cited an unnamed source as saying Bank of America sought to sell 3 billion-6 billion shares in China Construction Bank over the weekend at a discount of 13%-17% to the Chinese bank's closing share price Friday of HK$4.59.  Bank of America spokesman Robert Stickler said in an email to Dow Jones Newswires on Monday that a report in Hong Kong's Apple Daily, detailing the sale, 'is not true.'  'We did not sell anything, I am told,' Stickler added.  An official at China Construction Bank said Tuesday that Bank of America would inform them if the U.S. bank planned to reduce or increase its stake, but he said the Chinese bank hadn't received any such notice in recent days.  He said, however, that 'whether Bank of America cuts or increases its CCB stake is just a short-term measure. We still regard it as a long-term strategic partner.'  The people familiar with the situation told Dow Jones Newswires that UBS had been hired to handle the share sale, which was marketed to European and U.S. funds over the weekend. They didn't provide a reason for the deal's cancellation.  -By Nisha Gopalan, Dow Jones Newswires; 852-2832-2343; nisha.gopalan@ dowjones.com  (Rose Yu in Shanghai contributed to this article.)
