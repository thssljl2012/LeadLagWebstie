LONDON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Hong Kong's Exchange Fund is there to back the local currency but that does not mean the territory will invest entirely in liquid U.S. assets, the head of Hong Kong's central bank said in an interview published on Monday. HK Monetary Authority's Joseph Yam also told specialist-magazine Central Banking that the Exchange Fund has not experienced a backlash against its investments as it is keeping its distance from the sovereign wealth fund label, which he said had a bad connotation all of a sudden. 'The role of the Exchange Fund is very clearly defined in law, and that is to safeguard the exchange value of the domestic currency,' Yam said. 'And that function is reflected in our investment strategy, but that does not mean that we pour every cent of the Exchange Fund... into liquid U.S. dollar assets.' As of end-October, the Exchange Fund had HK$1,338.6 billion ($172.6 billion) in assets.
