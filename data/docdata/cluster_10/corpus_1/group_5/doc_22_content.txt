The chief executive of troubled Wall Street firm Merrill Lynch is seeking a US$10 million (HK$78 million) bonus this year in the midst of a financial crisis which plunged his company into dire straits, US media reported.  John Thain, who took the reins of the securities firm one year ago, has suggested to its directors that he be paid the 2008 bonus but the company's compensation committee is resisting, according to The Wall Street Journal.  The board was to meet to hear Thain's requests for himself and other executives. The firm had billions of dollars in losses this year and avoided collapse by selling itself to Bank of America.
