Cantor Fitzgerald has filed an application with the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for approval to launch an exchange that would allow users to speculate on the financial performance of major films.   The first product would be a 'Domestic Box Office Receipt' contract, according to Cantor, which made the filing with the CFTC at the start of this week.   One of the key aims of the new contracts would be to allow film financiers to hedge their risks, theoretically making the world of film finance slightly less problematic.   Since the credit crisis began, the film industry has been particularly badly hit, with banks once active in the sector, such as Merrill Lynch, which is in the process of being taken over by Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs increasingly taking a back-seat.   If the new exchange is successful, by providing willing counterparties keen to take on that risk, it may help to lead to a revival in financing returning to the sector.   Cantor already runs the Hollywood Stock Exchange a virtual entertainment stock market and believes opening a film exchange would be a popular move. 'It's clear from our conversations within the industry and investment community that there is a tremendous opportunity to introduce this exciting new tool to complement existing film financing alternatives,' said Andrew Wing, president of Cantor Entertainment. 'The market for Domestic Box Office Receipt contracts offers the motion picture industry, investment funds, banks and all other prospective investors a federally regulated trading exchange dedicated to the entertainment industry.' Cantor is hoping to list the first contracts by the end of March, subject to final approval from the CFTC.
