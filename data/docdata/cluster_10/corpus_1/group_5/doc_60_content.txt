Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. Inc. Chief Executive John Thain has requested that he receive no bonus for 2008.  According to a company press release, Thain and four top executives will not seek a bonus because of the current financial crisis. Thains position on his bonus marks a reversal, according to a published report. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the executive was seeking a bonus of up to $10 million. The newspaper cited unnamed sources.  Merrill Lynch (NYSE: MER) is expected to post a loss in the billions of dollars for the year. The board was reluctant to give Thain a large payout because of the sharp public backlash against large compensation packages in an industry thats surviving through a federal bailout, the newspaper said.  Thain engineered Merrills acquisition by Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC). Shareholders approved the deal Friday; its expected to close by year end. The deal had an announced price of $50 billion but is now valued at less than $20 billion because of BofAs declining stock price. BofA, California's largest bank by deposits, will issue 1.7 billion shares of common stock to pay for the acquisition.
