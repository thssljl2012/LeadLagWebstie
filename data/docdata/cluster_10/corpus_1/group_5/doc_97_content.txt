Wells Fargo Bank &amp;amp; Co. is cutting 53 jobs at its auto loan center in Tempe, Ariz. as result of the banks pending merger with Wachovia Corp.  San Francisco-based Wells Fargo and Charlotte, N.C.-based Wachovia are in the process of merging and meshing financial service offerings, including auto loans.  Wells Fargo has ceased indirect auto loan originations from centers in Tempe, Eden Prairie, Minn., and Chester, Pa., said Wells spokesman Steve Carlson in a statement. Some jobs were eliminated at Wells Fargo Auto Finance, affecting team members in indirect sales, underwriting and funding. Other Wells Fargo Auto Finance functions such as auto loan servicing will remain in these three locations, Carlson said. Wells officials would not disclose the number of job cuts at the three U.S. locations or how many workers would be left.  Wells reported the 53 Tempe layoffs to the Arizona Department of Economic Security. Bank officials said the impacted workers have a chance to find other jobs within the combined Wells-Wachovia company. Wells stepped in to merge with Wachovia, which posted a $4.8 billion third-quarter loss, as it was teetering on the brink of collapse. Citigroup Inc. also had been a Wachovia suitor, but the Wells deal moved forward with approval from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank and Wachovia shareholders. Four Wachovia board members have joined the Wells board.  The deal is among a number of titanic rescues on Wall Street and in the banking sector, including JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. merging with Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual Inc., and Bank of America Corp. acquiring Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. Inc. Wells, BofA and Chase also are getting equity infusions via the $700 billion federal bank bailout.
