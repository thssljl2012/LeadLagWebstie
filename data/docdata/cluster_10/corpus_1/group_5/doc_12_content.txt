The Mortgage Bankers Association said Friday that a record one in 10 American homeowners with a mortgage were either at least a month behind on their payments or in foreclosure at the end of September. There were, however, some modest signs of stabilization. The percentage of loans on which new foreclosures were started was 1.07 percent in the third quarter, flat from the second quarter.  U.S. consumers unexpectedly cut back on their borrowing in October as the economy sunk deeper into recession. The Federal Reserve reported Friday that consumer credit fell at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in October. That compared with a 3.1 percent growth rate logged in September, and marked the deepest cutback since August. Economists expected consumers to boost their borrowing by around $2 billion in October from the previous month. Instead, consumer debt dropped by $3.5 billion to $2.58 trillion.  Shareholders of Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp. on Friday approved the investment bank's sale to Bank of America, a move that will create the nation's largest financial-services firm. During a special shareholders meeting in New York, Merrill shareholders approved the sale of the company, bringing to an end the independence of an investment bank founded in 1914. Bank of America shareholders approved the deal later in the day.  The worsening U.S. auto sales slump claimed another 2,000 workers Friday as General Motors Corp. announced layoffs at three  more car factories. The company said it will cut shifts at car factories in Lordstown, Ohio; Orion Township, Mich.; and Oshawa, Ontario, starting in February due to slowing demand for their products. The layoffs amount to 2.4 percent of GM's North American blue-collar work force of 84,000. So far this year, GM has announced 11,000 factory worker layoffs in the U.S.  Intel Corp. could be preparing to lay off as much as 10 percent of its work force and cut its fourth-quarter guidance for the second time, Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &amp;amp; Co. analyst Craig Berger said Friday. Berger wrote in a note to clients that 'recent industry checks' suggest that Santa Clara-based Intel is preparing a large work force reduction that could be as high 83,000 employees, or 10 percent of its global staff. Berger said Intel could save $1 billion a year from a new restructuring and by reducing or eliminating some raises and bonuses because of the company's performance.
