General Motors Corp   Bank of America Corp   Capital One Financial   JPMorgan Chase and Co  MARKET GIVES BACK GAINS  The Dow  loading...    [ Loading...   ()  ] fell on Thursday on dimming prospects for an automaker bailout, while bleak comments about the banking sector from JPMorgan's CEO prompted investors to sell financial shares.  Most of the drop came late in the afternoon, but the day was governed by a steady stream of dismal corporate and economic news, including word that initial claims for unemployment benefits hit a 26-year high. The pullback was another setback for those Wall Street pundits who argue that stocks hit their bottom late last month.  Strategy Session with the Fast Money Traders  The story starts with the jobless numbers, says Pete Najarian. The news is awful. But its not so dire out there. The VIX  loading...    [VIX Loading...   ()  ], Wall Street's favorite measure of fear, finished flat.  Jamie Dimon scared investors and they took profits, adds Guy Adami.  The SRS  loading...    [SRS Loading...

And dont chase the coal stocks  loading...    [KOL Loading...   ()  ], adds Najarian. They wont continue on a straight line higher, they will come back.  DIMON DROPS FINANCIALS  JPMorgan Chase  loading...    [ Loading...   ()  ] led the financials lower after CEO Jamie Dimon told CNBC that the bank has had a 'terrible'' November and December, blaming the 'normal culprits'mortgages, credit, and high-yield bonds and loans.  He also said JP Morgan has used its portion of government bailout money to lend aggressively on a variety of fronts.  Though Dimon said his institution is in solid shape, he said the economy was facing many challenges ahead, primarily from unemployment. He said aggressive attempts to lower mortgage rates will be necessary to pull real estate from its slump.  The credit story has not improved over the last week, muses Karen Finerman. But the stocks have. Im short Capital One  loading...    [COF Loading...   ()  ].  I wouldnt short the retailers, adds Jeff Macke. Youd be late to the game.  Remember, celebrated short seller Bill Fleckenstein is shutting down his short trades, adds Guy Adami.

()  ] said on Thursday it plans to cut up to 35,000 jobs over the next three years. The reductions are coming from both companies and affect all lines of business and staff units. They also say the reductions will eliminate redundancies due to the merger with Merrill Lynch.  That cant be a good thing for real estate in the areas where the job cuts are most severe, says Karen Finerman.  ----------------  AUTO RESCUE UNDER FIRE  Prospects for passage of a $14 billion auto industry rescue package dimmed Thursday amid strong Republican opposition, despite urgent appeals by both President-elect Barack Obama and the Bush White House.  Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell came out against the legislationthe product of a hard-fought behind-the-scenes compromise between the majority Democrats and the White House.  Although a vote was expected to go up on Thursday night, neither Dems nor GOP leaders in Congress were optimistic that something would pass, explains John Harwood.  Its difficult to get a deal but it probably isnt over, he adds.  Right now GM  loading...    [GM Loading...   ()  ] is a trading vehicle, says Guy Adami. Deal or no deal I would not hold this stock for the long term.  ----------------  WILL FALLING DOLLAR HELP STOCKS?  The dollar fell on Thursday, as investors overcame their fears about the global credit crisis amid improving credit conditions and sought currencies with higher yields.  The dollar hit seven-week lows versus the euro and yen. It was dragged lower by data suggesting a further rise in unemployment, which should add pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again, further diminishing the dollar's appeal.  Moves in the dollar are directly related to moves in commodities, says Pete Najarian. The XLE  loading...    [XLE Loading...   ()  ] and OIH  loading...    [OIH Loading...

()  ] surged more than 10 percent on Thursday, settling at nearly $48 a barrel after the OPEC president called for more 'severe' production cuts.

[US@GC.1 Loading...   ()  ] bounced from lows to hit a 1-week high on Thursday while copper futures also held onto gains.  Pressure in commodities happened because hedge funds needed to liquidate their positions, says Jon Najarian. I think were going to see moves to the upside in 2009.  And if youre looking for a trade, keep an eye on gold stocks such as Gold Fields  loading...    [GFI Loading...   ()  ], Barrick Gold Corp  loading...    [ABX Loading...   ()  ] and Yamana  loading...    [AUY Loading...   ()  ], counsels Najarian. Options action suggests they could go higher in the first few months of next year. If the hedge funds werent liquidating I think gold would be around $900 an ounce.  Im curious to find out how much demand destruction has occurred versus supply destruction, muses Karen Finerman.  And keep an eye on infrastructure, counsels Jons brother Pete. Nucor  loading...    [NUE Loading...   ()  ] took off like a rocket and I like the direction.
