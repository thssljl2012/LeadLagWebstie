Bank of America Corp.s money-market funds touted as safe havens for investors have turned into a major headache for the big bank. The banks losses from shoring up money-market funds are approaching $1 billion this year. Burned by a series of bad investments in their bid to get juicy returns, these money-market funds have required capital support from Bank of America to protect investors from losses. And instead of subsiding, the pain appears to be escalating for the bank on some fronts, according to a recent regulatory filing.  Through the first nine months of 2008, Bank of America says it lost $886 million from providing capital support and from buying troubled assets held by a family of money-market funds run by its investment management arm, Columbia Management Group LLC. These cash funds, whose assets under management totaled $175 billion at the end of September, are largely run by a Boston-based team headed by Paul Quistberg, a former Putnam Investments executive hired earlier this year. Columbia Management declined to make any executives available for comment.
