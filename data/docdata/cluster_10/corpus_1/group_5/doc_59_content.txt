Another round layoffs at Bank of America. This time high level executives may be at risk of losing their jobs. Sources tell our news partners at the Charlotte Observer- that just days after one group of upper level executives were let go, more may be leaving soon.   Experts say these cuts are reaching into levels that often aren't impacted by reductions. UNCC finance professor Tony Plath says, 'this is the second level of cuts. It will go deeper. It won't be at the complete senior management level at the executive ranks. But probably a couple of steps down from that level. And it will be more inclusive and involve more people.' Bank of America is not saying which executives will be out of a job.
