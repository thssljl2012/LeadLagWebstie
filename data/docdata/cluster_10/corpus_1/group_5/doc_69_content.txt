NEW YORK, Dec 30 (Reuters) - U.S. loan issuance in 2008 tumbled to $764 billion, down 55 percent from $1.69 trillion in 2007, as a global credit crunch tightened credit to American businesses, according to data from Reuters Loan Pricing Corp. Investment-grade loans fell to $319 billion, down 52 percent from 2007's 658 billion, while leveraged loan issuance slid to $294 billion, down 57 percent from $689 billion in 2007, RLPC reported on Tuesday. JPMorgan was lead arranger for U.S. loans in 2008, with $198.5 billion, or 26 percent market share, followed by Bank of America, with $137.4 billion, or 18 percent market share, and Citigroup, with $116 billion, or 15 percent market share. Institutional loans were especially hard hit as collateralized loan obligations disappeared from the market. Loans purchased by institutional investors slid to $69.6 billion, down 84 percent from 2007's $425.8 billion.
