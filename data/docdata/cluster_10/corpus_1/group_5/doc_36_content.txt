Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is taking aim at Merrill Lynch, saying the struggling firm plans to reward it's CEO with a $10 million bonus.  In a letter to the company's Board of Directors Monday, the state's top lawyer said he's shocked by the reports after an 'abysmal' fiscal year where Merrill Lynch lost $11 billion and was taken over by Bank of America.  Cuomo said that under the firm's criteria for performance-based bonuses, the amount seems unjustified.  Merrill Lynch declined an opportunity to comment on the letter.  Meanwhile, the Attorney General's office is conducting a general investigation into Wall Street compensation.
