Bush wants to prevent 'body blow' Bill failure raises bankruptcy spectre Global markets rattled THE Bush administration says it may be willing to give emergency aid to the teetering US car industry, keeping open the prospects for a bailout the day after Congress failed to approve a deal.   Warning of dire consequences for the recession-hit US economy if the once-mighty carmakers collapsed, the White House - in a reversal of policy - said it was ready to consider dipping into a $US700 billion ($1 trillion) Wall Street bailout fund to help keep the companies afloat. 'The current weakened state of the economy is such that it could not withstand a body blow like a disorderly bankruptcy in the auto industry,' White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said.   Democratic leaders and the main US car workers' union appealed to President George W. Bush's Republican administration - now in its final weeks before turning over to Democratic President-elect Barack Obama - to provide emergency funds after a Senate deal to save Detroit's Big Three collapsed in acrimony yesterday. The failure of the $US14 billion bailout plan in Congress sent markets reeling around the world.   Shares in Toyota, the world's biggest carmaker, lost a tenth of their value, and European automakers also closed sharply lower.   But signs that the White House and US Treasury Department were prepared to mount a last-ditch effort to help the carmakers buoyed Wall Street, and large initial losses were mostly recouped.   Analysts say that without quick help, two of the country's major car manufacturers - General Motors and Chrysler - could face bankruptcy.   In response to the company's many struggles, GM said it would cut its first-quarter North American production by 60 per cent.   Treasury had pledged to pump $US250 billion into banks, but so far has only disbursed $US155.3 billion, with another $US10 billion for Merrill Lynch on hold pending its merger with Bank of America.
