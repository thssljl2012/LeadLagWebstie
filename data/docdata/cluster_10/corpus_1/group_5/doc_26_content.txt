Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. said Monday it will be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Dec. 25.  The move is in line with the U.S. investment bank's plan to become a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corp. on Jan. 1.  In September, BoA agreed to buy Merrill Lynch, a major U.S. investment bank hemorrhaging losses arising from the subprime mortgage fiasco.  The major securities house's stock was first listed on the TSE in November 1986.
