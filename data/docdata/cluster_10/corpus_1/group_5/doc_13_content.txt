As the world falls into depression, the Chinese are not exempt. One should, therefore, always pay attention if a leading Chinese businessman speaks more frankly than one might expect.   In recent weeks there have been suggestions that the West may be pulled out of the recession by Chinese help. China has one strong qualification for this role: the country has a lot of money, with about $2 trillion of currency reserves.   They also run a surplus on foreign trade. The Chinese have the capacity to invest.   Last week, Mr Lou Jiwei made an important speech in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, it dispels any illusion that China will audition for the role of the knight in shining armour who might rescue the West from the dragon of recession.   Mr Lou is certainly capable of making a contribution if he decides to do so. He is the chairman of China's largest  He used to have great optimism about investing in America. His fund invested 2.1bn ($3bn) in private equity fund The Blackstone Group. Unfortunately, Blackstone shares have fallen by about 80% since Mr Lou made his investment. I do not think he could have foreseen this fall unless he had predicted the closure of Lehman Brothers and the panic of the past five months.   Mr Lou told the Clinton Global Initiative Conference: 'Right now we do not have the courage to invest in financial institutions because we do not know what problems they may have... the policies of the developed nations on their financial institutions are not clear. Until they are clear, I don't dare to invest in them. What if they go bust? I will lose everything. We don't want to look at only the advanced or developing countries, we also want to look at emerging countries.'   I do not see that Mr Lou can be criticised. He might have run less risk in the past six months if he had invested in Asian emerging markets  In Britain we have no right to criticise the Chinese, who have made fewer mistakes than we have, but we need to understand their position. After America, China now matters most to the world economy.   Yet China depends on the West, just as much as the West depends on China. China is still an emerging market, though an extremely large one. At the beginning of the recession, the Chinese thought the credit crisis was a sickness of the West. China tended to overlook the old trading maxim that no one prospers when their customers are in trouble. An American recession was always bound to lead to trouble for the Chinese.   This recession has now produced a dangerous global deflation, which is hitting prices in all areas. Some countries have been hit more than others, but none has escaped the recession. That was also true of the Great Depression in the Thirties, and it is again the case now.   Indeed, I see little reason for governments, who were reluctant to accept the 'R' word of recession, still refusing to use the 'D' word of depression. In its universality, intensity and momentum, the recession of 2008 is the worst slowdown of the world economy since the Thirties. That is a depression.   How to spot a recession           This depression started in the first half of 2007. There had been preliminary signs of weakening confidence, and it was not until early August that a fully fledged housing and banking crisis emerged in America, followed immediately by Britain. Other countries, particularly in Europe, had a similar bubble in housing prices, but that had not yet burst.   The depression has spread from North America and Britain to most of the rest of the world, to Europe, to Japan, to the oil and commodity-producing countries. As their exports to America fall, China's growth rate has fallen, too.   Even the initial crisis of housing and banking in America has not been resolved. Some commentators believe the first sign of a real recovery will come in the American housing market, but that still looks far away.   The central banks have followed the conventional policy of cutting interest rates to counter the depression. In the past 20 years Alan Greenspan, when he was chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, cut interest rates whenever he became concerned about the risk of recession, and he was usually successful. Perhaps he merely postponed necessary corrections, which led to the crisis that happened after he left office in January 2006.   This time simply reducing central bank rates has had little effect. The attempts of the American and British governments to refinance their banks have also had limited impact, though the panic might well have been worse if they had not been willing to defend their banking systems.   In manufacturing, the worst damage has been done to an alreadyweakened automobile industry on which many other industries and jobs depend. People have delayed buying cars, and there is no sign of recovery. Interest rates have now been reduced to very low levels, making saving unattractive.   America and Britain, though not the old-fashioned European Central Bank, are considering the injection of unfunded subsidies - money that has yet to come into the coffers. This could undermine British credit and affect the Government's ability to borrow.   This is an alarming period for a frightened world, certainly the worst crisis of the past 75 years. It is testing the will and skill of governments and businessmen. Recovery will eventually come, but it is probably two or three years away. Until then, Britain's economic task is survival.
