BUSINESS DIGEST  BAILOUT FUND   U.S. House committee chief backs expanding use of money WASHINGTON A key House Democrat is pushing to get the second half of the $700 billion rescue fund released next month, before President-elect Barack Obama is inaugurated.   Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he is preparing legislation to require that some of the money be spent for specific purposes, such as stemming foreclosures and reducing mortgage rates.   Frank's bill would also impose tighter restrictions on the second $350 billion of the bailout funds, including requiring banks to report on their new lending every quarter and toughening limits on executive compensation. 'I don't want to wait until Obama,' Frank said. 'I think we can do it now.' HEAVY MACHINERY   Caterpillar to trim managers and executive pay, freeze hiring  Caterpillar Inc. said it will cut executive compensation by up to 50 percent next year because of slower demand amid the global economic downturn.   The company also said it was offering voluntary buyouts to about 25,000 U.S.-based managers and support employees and had instituted a global hiring freeze.   Caterpillar has expanded dramatically in recent years, driven partly by demand from infrastructure projects in developing countries.   The company announced last week that it would open a plant in Seguin.   INSURANCE   To pay back government loan, AIG selling unit at discount CHARLOTTE, N.C. American International Group Inc. said it will sell its Hartford Steam Boiler unit to German reinsurer Munich Re for $742 million as the embattled insurer divests itself of units to pay back a U.S. government bailout loan.   The purchase price is considered well below HSB Group Inc.'s value estimated at between $1 billion and $2 billion by the Financial Times.   INVESTMENTS   Treasury Department sells 2-year notes at all-time low WASHINGTON The Treasury Department said it auctioned $38 billion in two-year notes at a yield of 0.922 percent, an all-time low. The rate was down from 1.269 percent at the last auction of two-year notes on Nov. 24. The Treasury Department auctioned $27 billion in three-month bills at a discount rate of 0.040 percent, down from 0.050 percent last week. Another $27 billion in six-month bills was auctioned at a discount rate of 0.285 percent, up from 0.270 percent last week. The discount rates reflect that the bills sell for less than face value. For a $10,000 bill, the three-month price was $9,999.00, and a six-month bill sold for $9,985.67.
