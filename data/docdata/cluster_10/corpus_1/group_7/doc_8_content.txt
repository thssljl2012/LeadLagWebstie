Dayton Business Journal - by Mark Calvey DBJ Contributor  Related News  Growing talk on Wall Street sees Wells Fargo slashing its dividend as regulators take a harder look at the ability of big banks to weather worsening economic conditions.  Wells pays a quarterly dividend of 34 cents, or $1.68 annually, that yields more than 10 percent.  Earlier this week, J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) slashed its quarterly dividend 87 percent, to a nickel from 38 cents. At the time, analysts speculated that the move might trigger dividend cuts at Wells, U.S. Bank (NYSE: USB) and PNC Financial Services Group, (NYSE: PNC) which recently purchased Clevelands troubled National City.  Wednesdays Wall Street Journal added to the buzz with a Heard on the Street column that said Wells might have been too generous in boosting its dividend last year.  Wellss ratios are hardly impressive as it is, and look anything but bulletproof in the face of rising credit losses and huge economic uncertainty, the Wall Street Journal reported, noting that the banks Tier 1 capital ratio stands at 7.9 percent vs. 10.9 percent at J.P. Morgan Chase. The newspaper noted that Wells Fargos tangible common equity, a more conservative capital measure that Wells doesnt disclose, stands at an estimated $34 billion, or 2.68 percent of tangible assets. J.P. Morgans ratio is 3.8 percent.  A Wells Fargo spokesman said the bank cant comment on speculation.  Wells Fargos Tier 1 capital ratio fell 2.3 percentage points, to 7.9 percent, at the end of last year after taking several accounting hits to reflect Wachovias bad loans and other problems.  In announcing last years fourth-quarter results, the bank said, Given our strong balance sheet and business momentum, the board of directors declared a common stock dividend of 34 (cents) per share.  The San Francisco banking companys also noted that Wells Fargo Bank has the highest credit rating currently given to U.S. banks by Moodys Investors Service, Aa1, and Standard &amp; Poors Ratings Services, AA-plus.  As Wells (NYSE: WFC) digests Wachovia, Chase could have its share of trouble on the horizon, given its huge exposure to credit cards and the mess it has to clean up with the purchase of the failed banking operations of Washington Mutual.
