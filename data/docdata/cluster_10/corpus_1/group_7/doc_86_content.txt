TOKYO, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Japan's SFCG Co Ltd, a high-interest lender to smaller companies, said it has filed for bankruptcy protection with 338 billion yen ($3.6 billion) in debt on bad real estate-backed loans and tightening credit.   SFCG, which had borrowed heavily from foreign banks including Lehman Brothers, has also been slammed by tighter interest rate regulations in the consumer lender industry, forcing it to repay previous interest that was deemed too high.  It filed for court protection under the civil rehabilitation law, citing an inability to cope with mounting losses in its mainstay secured loans businesses on rising bankruptcies, sinking property prices, and weak demand for new loans.  Creditors to SFCG include Citibank, HypoVereinsbank, Shinsei Trust &amp; Banking Co, and Orix Trust and Banking Corp.  Shares of SFCG were untraded amid a glut of sell orders at 1,092 yen, down 15.5 percent from the closing price on Friday. The Nikkei average was down 2.6 percent.
