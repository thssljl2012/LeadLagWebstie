Earlier in February 2009, Citigroup announced its intent to sell its Nikko Cordial Securities, the Japanese brokerage unit. Only a few weeks later, the company may also be now considering to divest its Japanese investment banking unit, Nikko Citigroup. We think the potential for continued divesting of non-core (post the repeal of Glass-Steagall) remains high given Citigroup's current talks with federal regulators to increase up the government's stake (up to 40%) in the 3rd-biggest U.S. bank in terms of assets.
