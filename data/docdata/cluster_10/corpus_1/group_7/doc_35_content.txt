Gross: Nationalizing Banks the Wrong Solution  _uacct                        Gross: Nationalizing Banks the Wrong Solution Tuesday, February 24, 2009 3:41 PM  Article Font Size N  Nationalizing banks would be the wrong approach for the U.S. government and one that could "create an instability policy-makers should not want to risk," Bill Gross, chief investment officer of the giant bond firm PIMCO, said on Tuesday.   "The U.S. and global financial systems require credit creation and foreclosure prevention, not bank nationalization," Gross wrote in his March investment outlook newsletter.   In terms of investment strategies, Gross said PIMCO "continues the current theme of 'shake hands with Uncle Sam' -- buying agency mortgages, and other developing areas of government policy support in the credit markets."   He said the jury is still out on whether the U.S. economy faces a recession -- a relatively brief downturn -- or a more extreme depression.   Gross said that nationalizing banks for the United States was not as simple as the approach taken in the past by Sweden to cope with a banking meltdown.   "Their successful approach revolved around a handful of banks, but we have 7,500, as well as many savings and loans and credit unions, which would have to be flushed into government hands," he said.   "If you thought Lehman Brothers was a mistake, just stand by and see what nationalizing Citigroup or Bank of America would do."   Gross cited a need to "further capitalize systemically important banks via convertible bonds held by the government, which unfortunately dilute shareholders' interests."   "The goal of future policy should be to recapitalize lending institutions while maintaining the basic infrastructure of credit markets. Outright nationalization and haircutting of creditors will do just the opposite."   As the financial crisis grinds on, "there is fear on foreign shores that even U.S. agency debt may not be honored and that U.S. Treasury debt itself, when 'repoed' as in prior years, may now suffer from counterparty risk," Gross said.   "Global willingness to accept American dollars is being tested ... Watch the dollar. If it falls hard, there may be nothing policymakers can do to restore the ensuing financial chaos."   Posing a rhetorical question of whether the United States is in a "recession" or a "depression," Gross said "we don't know yet."   "The deflation that normally accompanies a depression is dangerous not because prices are going down, but because the 'for sale' sign goes up on the credit markets which have always made capitalism possible, he said. "Policy-makers are attempting to prevent that. We shall see."
