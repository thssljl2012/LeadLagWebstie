WASHINGTON, Feb 25 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday there was no plan to nationalize troubled U.S. bank Citigroup  'Nationalization to my mind is when the government seizes the bank, zeros out the shareholders and begins to manage and run the bank, and we don't plan anything like that,' Bernanke said during his semi-annual testimony to Congress.
