Citigroup, Bank of America and other big banks fell Wednesday following a two-day rally as investors await details of the government's stress-test plan. NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- The two-day rally in bank stocks ran out of steam Wednesday morning as Wall Street awaited further details on how the government planned to assess the health of the nation's leading lenders.Shares of struggling financial giants Bank of America (BAC, Fortune 500) and Citigroup (C, Fortune 500) fell 4% and 10% respectively. Other large banks were also lower, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM, Fortune 500) and Wells Fargo (WFC, Fortune 500), which lost 1% and 4% each.Bank stocks, as well as the broader market, soared Tuesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke downplayed fears that the government may have to step in and nationalize some of the country's largest financial institutions.Fears that the government may need to take over some troubled banks have hammered shares of Citigroup and Bank of America.Hoping to address the underlying health of many of these struggling financial institutions, federal regulators and the Treasury Department are expected to outline plans aimed at stress testing the biggest banks later Wednesday.The results of those tests could take weeks, experts note, but regulators have stressed that it would help identify which banks may require additional government support.
