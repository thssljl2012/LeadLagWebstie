Brokerage firm Merrill Lynch 'secretly and prematurely' paid $3.6 billion (2.5 billion) worth of bonuses to its employees shortly before it was acquired in a fire sale to prevent the firm's collapse, New York's attorney general has said.  In a letter to US lawmakers, Andrew Cuomo said the company had acted with the 'apparent complicity' of Bank of America, the company that bought out Merrill Lynch in September shortly before receiving a government bailout of its own, Bloomberg reports.  He added that the bonuses had been confined to a 'select group' of employees, with the top four recipients sharing $121 million. In all, 696 people received bonuses of at least $1 million.  At the time of the payments, both Merrill Lynch and BoA must have been aware of the company's 'disastrous' Q4 and annual results, the letter stated.  Mr Cuomo said this raises the 'disturbing question' of whether Merrill Lynch and BoA timed the bonuses to effectively 'force taxpayers to pay for them' through the government's bailout funding.  A statement from Merrill Lynch said the bonuses were proposed by management and sanctioned by its compensation committee while it was still an independent firm.  The $50 billion takeover Merrill Lynch created the world's biggest brokerage, with client assets of around $2.5 trillion.
