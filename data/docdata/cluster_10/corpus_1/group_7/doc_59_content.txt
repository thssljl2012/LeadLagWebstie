 Bank of America ruled out the need for fresh government aid or nationalisation, according to a memo by chief executive Ken Lewis, published in the Wall Street Journal at the weekend. 'Bank of America does not need any further assistance today, and I am confident we will not need any ... in the future,' says the memo. 'I believe our company has more than enough capital, liquidity and earnings power to make it through this downturn on our own from here on out.' - Sapa-AFP
