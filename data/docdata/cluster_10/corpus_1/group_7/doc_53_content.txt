HONG KONG (Reuters) - The U.S. government may end up holding as much as 40 percent of Citigroup's common stock, the Wall Street Journal reported on its website, citing sources familiar with the plans.  Citigroup executives are hoping the talks with U.S. federal officials will result in a stake closer to 25 percent, the Journal reported.  The paper, citing a spokesman at the U.S. lender, also reported that Bank of America is not discussing a larger ownership stake for the U.S. government.
