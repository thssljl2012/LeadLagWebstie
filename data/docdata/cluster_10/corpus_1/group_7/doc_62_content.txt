The current leaning of the futures market points to a modestly higher open for the broader market. That's nice to see for many participants given the prevailing trend, yet it is still little consolation given the scope of recent losses.  Reportedly, the news that the government might boost its stake in Citigroup (C) to as much as 40% by converting its preferred shares into common stock is driving the early buying interest.  Such talk is quelling concerns that festered Friday about a total nationalization of the bank. It's cold comfort really, but when you've been experiencing sub-zero temperatures for an extended length of time, even 20 degrees can feel warm for a bit.  Bank of America (BAC) is getting a sympathetic lift in pre-market action that is helping to prop up the futures market.  There isn't a lot of other specific corporate news of note this morning. Once again, it seems all headlines of import are being exported from Washington.  President Obama discussed over the weekend an aim to cut the budget deficit in half by the end of his first term in office; Treasury Secretary Geithner is supposedly going to announce more details this week with respect to his bank rescue plan; and there is a report that outside advisers to the U.S. Treasury have talked about lining up $40 billion in bankruptcy financing for General Motors (GM) and Chrysler should they need it.  With the government changing the investment landscape on what seems to be a weekly basis, the adverbial hurdle to investing grows higher as such intervention makes it difficult to determine where, when, why and how to invest in this environment.  It will be a good day when the market doesn't have to constantly turn its attention to Washington to get its directional signals.   Today it appears as if Washington is providing a good vibe, but in the grand scheme of things, we wouldn't consider this a good day for investors.
