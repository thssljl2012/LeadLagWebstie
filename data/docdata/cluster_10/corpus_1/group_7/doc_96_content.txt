Bank of America has ruled out the need for fresh government funds or nationalization, according to a memo authored by CEO Ken Lewis and published in the Wall Street Journal on Saturday.  'Bank of America does not need any further assistance today, and I am confident we will not need any further assistance in the future,' the memo read.  'I believe our company has more than enough capital, liquidity and earnings power to make it through this downturn on our own from here on out,' he said.  Lewis' comments came after Bank of America's share price was pummeled during trading last week following rumors that the US government could nationalize the bank and rival Citigroup.  The bank's share price had traded as low as 3.28 dollars a share last week -- the lowest level in 24 years -- before a slight uptick to 3.79 dollars at the end of Friday trading.  A string of commentators including the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan had advocated nationalization as the 'least worst option' as markets continued their meltdown.  In the memo to staff, Lewis warned 'the recession is continuing to worsen and that rising credit costs will continue to put great pressure on our ability to generate earnings.'  But in a glimmer of hope he added that by the middle of the first quarter trading activity had 'vastly improved' versus Q4 2008 and the corporate debt market was showing improvement.  According to Lewis Bank of America's purchase of Merrill Lynch -- which was an early casualty of the sub prime crisis -- was starting to show 'some benefits.'
