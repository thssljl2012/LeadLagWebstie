 NEW YORK, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp has agreed to provide about $7.7 million to settle allegations by Colorado that it improperly marketed subprime and other high-risk mortgages in the state.  Colorado had accused Countrywide of deceptively putting borrowers into high-risk, high-cost loans that quickly became unaffordable once low introductory rates expired and monthly payments increased dramatically.  John Suthers, the state's attorney general, in a statement said the settlement will allow about 6,800 borrowers to benefit from loan modifications, including by lowering their interest rates to as low as 3.5 percent for five years.  Countrywide did not immediately return a request seeking comment. The company was the largest U.S. mortgage lender before being acquired by Bank of America Corp (BAC.N  Suthers said the settlement calls for about $2.1 million of savings from waivers of late fees and prepayment penalties, and $1.2 million for relocation expenses. He said another $4.4 million will compensate borrowers who had made no more than six payments before finding their loans were no longer affordable.  Countrywide has settled similar allegations with several other U.S. states. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Bernard Orr)   Thomson Reuters 2009 All rights reserved
