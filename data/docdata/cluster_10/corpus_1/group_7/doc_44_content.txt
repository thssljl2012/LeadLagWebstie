NEW YORK, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management, a unit of Bank of America Corp, plans to cut less than 10 percent, or fewer than 1,000, support staff positions in its branch offices, Dow Jones Newswires said on Monday, citing people familiar with the situation.   The cuts will include some client associate and sales assistant positions, and the branches have more than 8,000 support staff, the newswire said.   Bank of America has previously said it plans to eliminate as many as 35,000 jobs in connection with its Jan. 1 purchase of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. A bank spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
