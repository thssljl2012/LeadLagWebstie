DUBAI: For brokers at places like Merrill Lynch, AG Edwards and UBS, the roller coaster ride may soon get rougher, according to analysts. Merrill's herd of about 15,500 brokers is suffering the indignity of working alongside traditionally less prestigious counterparts at Bank of America, which acquired Merrill in January.  Wachovia bought AG Edwards before being sold to Wells Fargo on Dec. 31. And at UBS, which acquired PaineWebber in 2000, brokers there have had to contend with speculation that their unit could be put up for sale.  Yet these companies, along with a broad swath of smaller wealth managers, may face more upheaval, likely in the form of mergers, joint ventures or unit sales, analysts said. 'It's possible that some of the units that were picked up through the major acquisitions will not ultimately fit,' said Elizabeth Nesvold, managing partner Silver Lane Advisors, an investment bank. 'Invariably we will see dispositions.' For potential acquirers, wealth management businesses, which basically handle investments for individual investors, are especially attractive as a steady source of revenue at a time when initial public offerings are rare, mergers are scarce and trading risk must be lowered. But as the financial crisis persists, banks face the challenge of cutting costs, shielding brokerage operations from the rest of their troubles and fighting the flight of financial advisers to rivals and networks of independent brokers.  In some cases, Morgan Stanley's pending joint venture with Smith Barney, a unit of Citigroup, could be a model for future deals. Last month, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay Citigroup $2.7 billion to take a 51 percent stake in the joint venture, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. Aside from lifting Citigroup's capital and diversifying Morgan Stanley's income, the venture is expected to generate $1.1 billion in savings. 'Most firms have reduced whatever costs they can without starting to cut into muscle, which means shrinking client services or business lines,' said Eric Weber, chief operating officer of Freeman, a financial services advisory firm.  Referring to information technology and human resources, he added, 'Merging businesses means you don't need two general counsels, or two heads of IT, or two heads of HR.' Mergers or joint ventures could also help shield the advisory business from the rest of the issues at a company. 'There is probably something to be said for the ability to separate advisory and retail businesses from more institutional businesses and sell-side activities,' said Mark Halverson, global head of the asset management services practice at Accenture, the consulting company. 'It's something that I know a lot of firms are at least considering.' Recent deals have also broadened the gap between the industry's giants. Merrill-Bank of America, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney (assuming that the joint venture is approved) and Wachovia each handle $1 trillion to $2 trillion in client assets, compared with $518 billion at UBS, the Swiss bank.  UBS had discussions late last year with Morgan Stanley and with Wachovia about deals involving its U.S business. But no deal emerged and UBS intends to stick with its U.S. brokerage.  Marten Hoekstra, chief executive of UBS Wealth Management Americas, said last week that the bank was looking to recruit advisers to take advantage of the turmoil. Although he would not rule out small acquisitions, Hoekstra said expansion through hiring appeared more attractive now. 'Organic growth will have higher payoff over five years than acquisition opportunities,' he said. Brokerage combinations come with their share of risks, too. Deals tend to prompt an exodus of advisers, which pushes companies to provide generous retention payments. Moreover, businesses do not always fit together smoothly. 'Every time you see another merger, we get a flood of phone calls,' Barnaby Grist, a managing director at Schwab Advisor Services, which provides custodian and operational services to independent brokers. 'The retention rates go down in these very large firms because they are so inflexible.' Companies also face many challenges in the current environment, possibly making it tougher for merged brokers to work. Analysts warn that the financial crisis and recession could keep many investors on the sidelines. Commissions and brokerage fees would very likely decline. 'It all comes down to issues of size, scale and operating leverage,' said Weber, the executive at Freeman. 'If 20 to 50 percent of your revenue just vaporized because of the market downturn, you need to get costs in line.'
