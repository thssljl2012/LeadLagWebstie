Edwards, the roller coaster ride may be just beginning.  Merrill's thundering herd of roughly 15,500 brokers is suffering the indignity of working alongside traditionally less prestigious counterparts at new parent Bank of America Corp (BAC.N)  Wachovia Corp bought AG Edwards before the bank fell on hard times and succumbed to a fire sale to Wells Fargo &amp; Co(WFC.N). And at UBS, brokers at the former PaineWebber have had to contend with speculation that their unit could be put up for sale.  Yet these firms, along with a broad swathe of smaller wealth managers, may face more upheaval, likely in the form of mergers, joint ventures or unit sales, experts said.  'It's possible that some of the units that were picked up through the major acquisitions will not ultimately fit,' said Elizabeth Nesvold, managing partner of investment bank Silver Lane Advisors. 'Invariably we will see dispositions.'  For potential acquirers, wealth management businesses -- basically handling investments for individual investors -- are especially attractive as a steady source of revenue at a time when initial public offerings are rare, mergers are scarce and trading risk must be toned down.  But as the financial crisis persists, banks face the challenge of cutting costs, shielding their brokerage operations from the rest of their troubles and fighting the flight of financial advisers to rivals and networks of independent brokers.  In some cases, Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) pending joint venture with Citigroup Inc's (C.N) Smith Barney could be a model for future deals.  Last month, Morgan Stanley agreed to pay Citi $2.7 billion to take a 51 percent stake in the joint venture, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. Aside from boosting Citi's capital and diversifying Morgan Stanley's income, the venture is expected to generate $1.1 billion in savings.  'Most firms have reduced whatever costs they can without starting to cut into muscle, which means shrinking client services or business lines,' said Eric Weber, chief operating officer of Freeman &amp; Co, an advisory firm focused on financial services. 'Merging businesses means you don't need two general counsels, or two heads of IT (information technology), or two heads of HR (human resources).'  Mergers or joint ventures could also help shield the advisory business from the rest of the issues at a firm.  'There is probably something to be said for the ability to separate advisory and retail businesses from more institutional businesses and sell-side activities,' said Mark Halverson, global head of Accenture's asset management services practice. 'It's something that I know a lot of firms are at least considering.'  ORGANIC GROWTH  Recent deals have also broadened the gap between the industry's giants. Merrill-BofA, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney and Wachovia each handle between $1 trillion and $2 trillion in client assets, compared with $518 billion at UBS. Continued...
