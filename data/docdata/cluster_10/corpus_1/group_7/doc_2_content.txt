US bank shares  on Thursday on fears the government will have to nationalise troubled institutions such as Citigroup and Bank of America. BofA shares slid 14% to $3.93, their lowest since 1984. Citi shares were down 13.8% to their lowest since 1991. The KBW banks index fell to its lowest level since 1992. In the debt markets, Citis bonds were trading at distressed levels. Some banks are believed to be in talks with regulators over plans that would provide them further capital injections but stop short of outright nationalisation.
