NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Citigroup is in talks that could result in the U.S. government increasing its stake in what was the country's most valuable bank, a source said, and the Wall Street Journal said taxpayers could own as much as 40 percent of the ailing lender's common stock.  But the Journal, citing sources familiar with the talks, said Citigroup executives hope discussions with U.S. officials will result in a government stake closer to 25 percent.  The administration of President Barack Obama has not indicated whether it supports the plan, the report said.  A source familiar with the situation told Reuters that talks were ongoing between Citi and regulators that could increase the government's stake.  Citi is discussing with U.S. officials a scenario under which a substantial portion of the $45 billion in preferred shares held by the U.S. government, amounting to a 7.8 percent stake in Citigroup, would convert into common stock, the Journal reported.  The plan would not cost further taxpayer money, but other Citi shareholders would see their stakes diluted and the government would have much larger influence over Citi.  The New York Times reported on its website that the plan being contemplated at Citi could pave the way for similar moves at other big banks.  Separately, the Financial Times said Citigroup was pressing the U.S. government to agree on a new capital injection that would increase the authorities' stake in the bank to about 40 percent, but stop short of outright nationalization.  U.S. stock futures rose 1.2 percent, and Treasuries fell, after the reports on Monday. 'It's a sign of relief that the move at least removes some of the uncertainty around the banking sector,' said Tony Morriss, senior markets strategist at ANZ Investment Bank, in Sydney. 'They are certainly moving much faster this time and it can be taken as a commitment that some banks are too big to fail and the economic consequences too bad to contemplate.'
