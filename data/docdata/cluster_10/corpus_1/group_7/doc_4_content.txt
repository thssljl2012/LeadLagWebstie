FRONTLINE's 'Inside the Meltdown' investigates the causes of the worst economic crisis in 70 years and how the government responded. Chronicling the inside stories of the Bear Stearns deal, Lehman Brothers' collapse, the propping up of insurance giant AIG, and the $700 billion bailout, veteran FRONTLINE producer Michael Kirk (Bush's War) examines what Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke didn't see, couldn't stop and haven't been able to fix. 'Many Americans still don't understand what has happened to the economy,' Kirk says. 'How did it all go so bad so quickly? Who is responsible? How effective has the response from Washington and Wall Street been? Those are the questions at the heart of 'Inside the Meltdown.'' TV Guide calls 'Inside the Meltdown' a '... must-see look at the financial mess affecting us all.' Rolling Stone says it is '... far and away the best account of the collapse on TV.' And USA Today calls the film '... illuminating and sobering... like being a fly on the wall.'
