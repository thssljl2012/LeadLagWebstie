Anchor BanCorp Wisconsin Inc. has a $116 million debt to U.S. Bank National Association, and if it doesnt raise capital to pay off that debt, it might not survive, the company reported in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.  AnchorBank, which is not related to Wayzata-based Anchor Bancorp Inc., must pay U.S. Bank nearly half of the debt on March 2, according to the SEC filing Tuesday. If the debt is not paid, U.S. Bank, based in Minneapolis, could seize AnchorBank in a foreclosure proceeding since the debt is secured by stock. Failure by us to meet our payment obligations to [to U.S. Bank by March 2] could have a material adverse affect on our business operations, AnchorBank warned in the filing. If U.S. Bank refuses to renew or refinance the revolving line of credit, it could result in our insolvency if we are unable to repay the debt. Besides refusing further credit to AnchorBank, U.S. Bank could seize the outstanding shares of [AnchorBanks] capital stock ... which have been pledged as collateral, AnchorBank reported in the filing.  This could impair AnchorBanks ability to continue as a going concern. AnchorBank has several branches in the western-Wisconsin portion of the Twin Cities metro area. The loan from U.S. Bank financed AnchorBanks acquisition in 2007 of parts of S&amp;C Bank, based in New Richmond-Wis., which gave AnchorBank its western Wisconsin presence.  AnchorBank reported losses of $167.3 million in its fiscal third quarter, ending Dec. 31, because of problem loans.
