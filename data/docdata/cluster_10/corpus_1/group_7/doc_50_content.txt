(Adds details on number of support staff, recent layoffs of rookie brokers, closing share price.)  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management, a unit of Bank of America Corp. (BAC), plans to cut less than 10%, or under 1,000, support staff positions in its branch offices, according to people familiar with the situation.  The cuts, which will include some client associate and sales assistant positions, come as Merrill recently let go several hundred rookie brokers based both on performance and an effort to reduce costs.  The firm has also lost several key executives, including former Chief Executive John Thain; Robert McCann, former head of the wealth management unit; and Greg Fleming, former chief operating officer and the No. 2 executive at Merrill.  The firm has more than 8,000 support staff in its branches.  Bank of America, which completed its acquisition of Merrill Jan. 1, has been hammered by a financial crisis and weak economy, and the Charlotte banking giant's stock has also been plagued recently by fears of nationalization. Monday, however, Bank of America's shares rose for the second straight session on news of insider stock purchases, and comments dismissing a nationalization plan.  In December and January, Merrill had let go some financial advisers who had been with the firm less than two years, based on performance objectives. New brokers have had an especially difficult time building up client asset levels to reach performance goals, given the plunging stock market.  'My view is you need support staff just as much, or more, in this environment, ' said a Merrill Lynch broker in the northeast U.S.  Bank of America shares closed Monday up 76 cents, or 12%, at $6.89.  -Brett Philbin, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5393; brett.philbin@dowjones.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires 02-09-09 1654ET Copyright (c) 2009 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
