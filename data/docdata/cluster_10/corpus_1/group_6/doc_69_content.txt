 WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus on Friday unveiled a $275 billion package of tax cuts and incentives aimed at boosting the struggling economy and the panel will consider it on Jan. 27.  The package, which has many similarities to legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives, had about $30 billion in tax breaks and incentives aimed at creating energy jobs.  With $1 trillion deficits expected for the next several years, the measure would also increase the federal government's borrowing authority to $12.14 trillion from $11.315 trillion, according to a summary issued by Baucus' office.
