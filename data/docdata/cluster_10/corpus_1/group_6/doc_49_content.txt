Article from:   Dow Jones Newswires  ANOTHER week, another bank bailout and another drop for the Wall Street stock market.  US stocks rose on a volatile session to limit losses on the week as strength for Intel offset a drop for the latest recipients of Government assistance, Bank of America and Citigroup.  Bank of America tumbled $US1.14, or 14 per cent, to $US7.18, bringing its losses for the week to 45 per cent.  BofA posted a $US1.79 billion ($2.7 billion) quarterly loss and receiving another $US20 billion injection of Government funds to help absorb losses from its recent acquisition of Merrill Lynch.  The largest US bank by assets was once seen as a strong hand in the financial crisis, and in mid-September was confident it could digest Merrill Lynch without government assistance.  Citigroup shed US33c, or 8.6 per cent, to $US3.50 for losses of 48 per cent on the week. Citi reported an $US8.29 billion fourth-quarter loss.  Chief executive Vikram Pandit split the financial conglomerate in two, with one segment focused on conventional banking and the other used as a 'bad bank,' or repository for bad assets.  The Government also guaranteed losses on more than $US400 billion of assets for Citigroup and Bank of America.  Another bank that was a buyer during September, taking over some of Lehman Brothers operations, Barclays, saw its US listed shares fall $US1.15, or 14 per cent, to $US7.25, though it pared losses after saying its 2009 profit would likely exceed Wall Street estimates.  Analysts cited fears that another round of capital injections from the UK government could dilute Barclays shares. The Times of London newspaper reported that the UK government is considering fresh measures to get banks lending - including capital injections. Barclays and peer HSBC Holdings have so far refused government cash.  Shares of HSBC Holdings, a banking giant originally set up by the British in Hong Kong, fell US38c, or 0.9 per cent, to $US39.95.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68.73 points, or 0.84 per cent, to 8281.22, though it finished the week with a loss of 3.7 per cent. The broad Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index added 6.38 points, or 0.76 per cent, to 850.12, off 4.5 per cent on the week.  The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite added 17.49 points, or 1.16 per cent, to 1529.33, helped by strength in the semiconductor sector. The Nasdaq lost 2.7 per cent on the week.  Intel was the second strongest stock on the Dow, adding US45c, or 3.4 per cent, to $US13.74. The gains came even though the chip giant said fourth-quarter revenue fell 23 per cent to $US8.23 billion and forecast a sharp contraction in profit margins in the first quarter.  Its shares fell 2.9 per cent on the week.
