FELIX SALMON has been at the hub of a long and excellent debate on the merits of nationalisation as a solution to the current banking crisis. Today he asks a pointed questionmight nationalisation be contagious?  But let's say that the government took over Bank of America and/or Citigroup, wiping out shareholders and probably preferred stockholders as well. What would happen to JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo? Would their stocks plunge in fear that they, too, might get nationalized, with their stock going to zero? And would such a plunge end up becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy?  That certainly is a possibility. On the other hand, exclusion from a round of nationalisation ought to serve as a strong signal of the financial wherewithal of the surviving banks. What's more, it's probable that any bank which survives the crisis un-nationalised will emerge with market share and reputation enhanced. This, it seems, was the case with Handelsbanken, which managed not to catch nationalisation from Nordbanken and Gota, and came through in an enviable competitive position. It's possible that shareholders might flock to a non-nationalised bank, pushing it toward greater, rather than less, security.  In fact, there will probably be some event horizon should there be a round of nationalisation, such that solvent banks on one side are strengthened by the act and solvent banks on the other side are sucked into the nationalisation vortex. And a problem remainshow certain can we be that most of the remaining large banks are on the healthy side of that horizon?  If we can't answer that question in a satisfactory fashion, then we should tread very carefully on the nationalisation front (recognising, as always, that there are serious risks to not nationalising, as well).
