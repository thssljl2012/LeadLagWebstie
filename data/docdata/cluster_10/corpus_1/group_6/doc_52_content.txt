ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. - Thousands of New Mexicans could be eligible for help with their mortgages thanks to a settlement with Countrywide Financial Corp.  Attorney General Gary King says the settlement agreement will help many people avoid foreclosure and the loss of their homes.  Countrywide, which was acquired by Bank of America Corp. last year, has agreed to provide loan modifications to nearly 397,000 borrowers nationwide.  The agreement settles allegations that Countrywide used unfair and deceptive tactics in its loan-origination and servicing activities, which left borrowers in structurally unfair and unaffordable loans.  King says more than 8 percent of all Countrywide mortgage loans in New Mexico are delinquent or facing foreclosure.
