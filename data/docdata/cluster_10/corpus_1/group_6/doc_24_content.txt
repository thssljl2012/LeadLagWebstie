U.S. stocks slumped in recent trade as a tumble for Barclays late in London's session weighed on a financial sector that was already damped by renewed government efforts to prop up ailing banks that could dilute shareholders. Barclays shares were off nearly 30% on the NYSE recently, though there wasn't concrete news to explain the drop. Notably, Barclays is at the forefront of U.K. banks with exposure to asset-backed securities, noted James Hughes, a trader at CMC Markets. Also, the Times (of London) newspaper reported Friday that the U.K. government is considering fresh measures in the U.K. to get banks lending - including capital injections - and that an announcement could be made early next week. Barclays and HSBC Holdings have so far refused government cash. After trading up nearly 130 points at its morning high, the Dow Jones Industrial Average recently slid 70 points, or 0.8%, to 8141. The index is being hurt by heavy declines in most of its financial components, with several traders noting the late drop for Barclays spurred much of the recent activity in large banks. As for U.S. firms, Citigroup was off 3% after some morning gains after the government moved to back $400 billion of its assets. Citigroup also reported an $8.29 billion quarterly loss and said it would split into two business units, with one made up of brokerage and retail asset management, local consumer finance and a special asset pool. Shares in other financial blue chips fared much worse. Bank of America tumbled 15% after reporting a $1.79 billion loss and receiving a $20 billion injection of government funds to bolster its balance sheet. 'There will be some price to pay for all of the things the government is doing right now. You can't just wave a magic wand and everything is better,' said Barry Ziskin, chief executive of Z-Seven Fund. The capital injection into Bank of America and the guarantees for them and Citigroup are 'still treating the symptoms,' said Michael Darda, an economist with MKM Partners in Greenwich, Conn. 'The underlying cause is falling home prices and highly leveraged households,' he said. Darda ran some data on the last 'bottom' for financial stocks, and the broad market after a banking crisis, January 1991. Back then, the inventory of houses on the market was far less than it is now, and interbank borrowing rates were much closer to Treasury rates. In other words, the banks are still working their way through this crisis. And some traders are beginning to mistrust 'bailout rallies' as 'artificial bottoms,' as was the case earlier Friday. They are reluctant to buy into these moves until the stock market can rally on something other than a report of government intervention. 'With government bailouts, the market reacts positively at first - and then a couple of weeks later, we realize this is an even bigger mess than was before,' said Joe Saluzzi, head trader at Themis Trading. Saluzzi believes the S&amp;P 500 may eventually dip below 700 before this bear market is over. The broad measure was recently off 8 points, or 1%, to 835, hurt by a 6% slide in its financial sector. The only two categories up were utilities and consumer staples, which are both traditional safe-haven bets. Other market yardsticks moved from early gains to losses. The small-stock Russell 2000 was off 2% to 453.62. The technology-oriented Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.9% to trade at 1498, its losses held in check by a 1% rise in Intel after the world's top chip maker reported a 90% profit drop, in line with analysts' estimates. -Contact: 201-938-5400
