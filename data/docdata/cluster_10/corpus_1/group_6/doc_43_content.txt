Bank of America's board of directors is expected to meet with CEO Ken Lewis to address a number of issues, including the bank's struggle to handle the losses of recently-acquired Merrill Lynch and the ouster of Merrill's CEO John Thain.  Wells Fargo, which merged with Wachovia last year, will also release its fourth quarter report, an announcement that could impact future layoffs.  'What we're really waiting to see is how deep the losses on the Wells Fargo side, not the Wachovia side, how deep the losses on the Wells Fargo side are likely to be, said UNC Charlotte economist Tony Plath. And if they're deeper than expected, then I would expect that we're going to see an acceleration in the way that they lay people off.'  US Airways, whose largest hub is in Charlotte, will also release its fourth quarter report Thursday.
