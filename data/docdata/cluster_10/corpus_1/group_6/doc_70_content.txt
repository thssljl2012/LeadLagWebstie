NEW YORK (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C - News) named Richard Parsons as its chairman, in the latest management change to shake the U.S. bank that has been walloped by the credit crunch.  Parsons, 60, will succeed Sir Win Bischoff effective February 23, the bank said in a statement. Bischoff, 66, will not stand for reelection to the board and will retire from Citi later this year.  Bischoff's departure follows the exit of Robert Rubin, a former U.S. Treasury Secretary who does not plan to seek reelection to the board. Rubin earlier this month resigned from his role as senior counselor at Citigroup. '  (Reporting by Dan Wilchins; editing by Carol Bishopric)
