Mike Mayo of Deutsche Bank asked, 'So, were you able to walk away from the Merrill Lynch deal, I mean if it was so much worse as of mid-December, couldn't you say, hey, let's renegotiate or let's do something?  Lewis replied: Well, let me just kind of take you through that. It's a very legitimate question. As we saw the anticipated fourth-quarter losses accelerating, we did evaluate our rights under the merger agreement and during that time we spoke to and were in close coordination with officials from both the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. The government was firmly of the view that terminating or delaying the closing of the transaction could lead to significant significant concerns and could result in serious systemic harm, and a repricing, assuming it could be agreed, would have a new stockholder vote both at Bank of America and at Merrill Lynch and therefore would have been delayed by at least a couple of months, and that would have led to considerable uncertainty and could have well cost more than the repricing we would have saved. And I think in recognition of the position of Bank of America was in, both the Treasury and the Federal Reserve gave us assurances in December that we should close the deal and that the government would provide the assistance we've been talking about. So particularly ringing - putting a fencearound some of the assets that we were most concerned about. And so in view of all of those considerations, and in view that strategically, Merrill Lynch remains a solid franchise, we just thought it was in the best interest of our company and our stockholders, and the country, to move forward with the original terms and the timing.  Mayo responded: So what I think I hear is you're kind of helping out the country, doing a little bit of a favor, so why in turn is the company put in some chains in terms of the executive compensation limits, and it seems like the regulators got tougher on Bank of America as a whole, because you went out of your way to kind of make Merrill Lynch work. Or am I misreading something here?  Lewis came back with: Well, I think you have to think about it in a broader perspective, that you can't - that there are going to be issues with others, and there have been issues with others and we did think we were doing the right thing for the country, but at the same time, from the government's perspective, they've got to have some template and not have us be seen as played with favoritism.
