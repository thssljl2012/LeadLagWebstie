WASHINGTON  In a move that would help troubled homeowners, Citigroup agreed to support legislation that would let bankruptcy judges cut mortgage rates for at-risk borrowers, leading Congressional Democrats said on Thursday.  Financial industry lobbyists, however, said the plan was flawed and vowed to fight legislation aimed at easing up on homeowners facing foreclosure.  Members of the House and Senate said Citigroup had agreed to drop its opposition, providing no future mortgages are covered by the law.  Citigroup, which is receiving more than $300 billion in bailout assistance, says that it was open to measures that would help homeowners. Citi shares this legislations goal to help distressed borrowers stay in their homes, and believes it will serve as an additional tool to the extensive home retention programs currently in place to help at-risk borrowers, Vikram S. Pandit, the chief executive of Citigroup, wrote in a letter released Thursday night.  The revised bill that Citigroup endorsed would allow bankruptcy judges to adjust the principal payments or interest rates on existing loans.  Judges could also extend the terms on mortgage loans, according to the language of the bill, which would force lenders to take losses without a say in bankruptcy court proceedings.  Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said he and fellow backers of the plan see it as a way to create more voluntary negotiations between struggling homeowners and financial institutions. So far, voluntary programs have proved ineffective, Democrats said.  Citigroup had been part of the Bankruptcy Coalition of the Financial Services Roundtable, an industry group, since it aggressively lobbied for changes to the bankruptcy code in 2005. The coalition  a group of major trade associations and lenders like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo
