Thain was Merrill Lynchs CEO when Bank of America agreed to buy the company in a hastily arranged deal late last year. Bank of America Chairman and CEO Ken Lewis then tapped Thain to be the head of the combined companys global wealth and investment management business.  But sentiment against Thain turned after Bank of America learned Merrill Lynch had preliminary losses in the fourth quarter of more than $15 billion. That shocker stunned Lewis and the rest of the banks board of directors. The revelation came just a couple of weeks after Bank of America closed the Merrill Lynch acquisition on Jan. 1.  A Wall Street veteran with Goldman Sachs pedigree, Thain was fired after a brief meeting with Lewis Thursday morning, according to published reports.  Cable news channel CNBC reported that Thain spent lavishly in early 2008 to remodel his Merrill Lynch office in Manhattan. Merrill hired Thain to replace CEO Stan ONeal, who was fired after billions of dollars of credit losses piled up at the brokerage in 2007.  To replace Thain, Lewis named Moynihan, a veteran Boston banking executive, as president of global banking and global wealth and investment management. Moynihan, 49, joined Fleet Financial Group in 1993 as deputy general counsel.  Moynihan had been general counsel of Bank of America. Before the bank acquired Merrill Lynch, Moynihan ran global corporate and investment banking for Bank of America.  His primary residence has remained in Wellesley even though much of Moynihans work of late has been based in New York. Its unclear to what degree his new appointment may swing some of Bank of Americas power base in wealth and investment management back to Boston. He has excelled at everything we have asked him to do. Lewis said in a press release. Lewis emphasized that the change in leadership in no way reflects a significant change in direction for the global banking or wealth management units.  Moynihan joined Bank of America in 2004, following the banks takeover of FleetBoston Financial. At Fleet, he led brokerage and wealth management after leading Fleets Internet strategy.
