CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Bank of America Corp. reported a $2.39 billion fourth-quarter loss on Friday, but financial experts say that the news is not as bad as expected. 'I know that sounds like a big number but in light of what other banks have disclosed this year it's not a significantly large number,' said Tony Plath, a leading economist and professor at UNC-Charlotte.   Plath says most people thought Bank of America's fourth-quarter earnings were going to be a lot worse. 'The losses the bank has experienced are manageable,' he said. Plath says that is why the bank decided to release the numbers a few days early. 'The bank wisely chose to end the drama and the suspense, lay their cards on the table rather than make us wait until Tuesday where people would expect the worst and things would continue to deteriorate,' Plath said. The banks stock had plummeted when word broke that it had requested a second round of government bailout money -- $20 billion -- to help deal with the losses is absorbed from Merrill Lynch. The bank confirmed Friday that it will get federal help. 'The bank is fine,' said Charlotte Mayor Pat McCrory.   McCrory said the city should be fine, too. 'I'm still very confident that Bank of America is going to be strong in the end and Charlotte will remain strong,' he said. So what happens to credit card customers? 'If you make your payments on time and you still have your job, the answer is likely nothing,' Plath said. He says most people who bank at Bank of America will not notice a difference as a result of Friday's announcements.
