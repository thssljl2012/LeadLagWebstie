Bank of America Corp. is selling part of its stake in China's second-largest bank, China Construction Bank Ltd. said Wednesday, in a sale that could be worth up to $3 billion as the U.S. financial company raises money to cope with turmoil in its home market.  Bank of America will sell 5.62 billion shares it holds in China Construction Bank, the Chinese bank said in a statement. It gave no financial details but Construction Bank shares were trading at 4.24 Hong Kong dollars (54 U.S. cents) on Wednesday morning in Hong Kong, which could make the deal worth up to $3 billion.  Phone calls to Bank of America's Asian headquarters in Singapore were not answered.  Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, bought 9 percent of Construction Bank in 2005 for $3 billion and paid $1.9 billion in May to raise its stake to 11 percent. It was not immediately clear what proportion of Construction Bank shares it would own if the sale announced Wednesday goes ahead as planned.
