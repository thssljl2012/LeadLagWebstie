Bernard Madoff's alleged massive financial fraud has sparked more outrage as news circulates a major US bank may have cashed out early, while other investors were left high and dry.  The New York Times reported that JPMorgan Chase suddenly began pulling its money out of two hedge funds that invested with Madoff last fall before Madoff was arrested, but did not tell investors.  According to the newspaper, JP Morgan said its potential losses related to Madoff are 'pretty close to zero.'  A JP Morgan Chase spokeswoman did not return several calls seeking comment.  As lawyers and investors digested the story, they began questioning how big players may have been able to protect themselves from Madoff, while small investors were left exposed.  Keith Dutill, a partner at law firm Stradley Ronon Stevens &amp; Young, said investors who bought the leveraged notes issued by JP Morgan Chase are very angry and want to know what the bank knew and when it knew it.  US officials arrested Madoff last month after he allegedly told his sons his investment-advisory business was 'one big lie.'
