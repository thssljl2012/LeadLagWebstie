As his company's stock was falling 29 percent on Tuesday, Bank of America Corp. chief executive Ken Lewis was spending $1.2 million to buy 200,000 shares of the Charlotte bank's common stock, according to a securities filing today. Five other bank directors, including lead director Temple Sloan, also made stock purchases on Tuesday. A bank spokesman declined to comment.   Bank of America's stock has been slammed in recent weeks by the need for a new round of government aid and the disclosure of a $2.4 billion fourth-quarter loss. Chief executives and directors can buy stock in their company as a vote of confidence in future performance, but the move doesn't always work out.   Wachovia CEO Ken Thompson bought 100,000 shares of his company's stock in November 2007 but lost his job in June as the company grappled with massive loan losses and a falling stock price. Thompson's successor, Bob Steel, bought 1 million Wachovia shares in July, but the stock later took a steep dive. When Wells Fargo &amp; Co. bought Wachovia last month, they gave shareholders a fraction of a Wells Fargo share for each Wachovia share.   On Tuesday, Lewis bought his shares at prices ranging from $5.98 to $6.06. In afternoon trading, Bank of America shares are up nearly 22 percent to $6.22.   The bank also disclosed today that Lewis bought 86,000 shares of preferred Bank of America shares for about $2 million in November.   The other directors who made purchases were Sloan (41,800), former Lowe's Cos. CEO Robert Tillman (200,000); John Collins (31,600); William Barnet (30,000); Jackie Ward (16,800).
