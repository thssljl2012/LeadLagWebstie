Bob Diamond, president of Barclays, has decided not to attend the World Economic Forum at Davos, after a volatile fortnight for the British bank. A Barclays spokesman confirmed that Mr Diamond would not make an appearance at the event, but declined to comment on the reasons why.   Mr Diamond is one of a number of bankers who will not attend the 39th annual World Economic Forum, including Vikram Pandit, the chief executive of Citigroup, the embattled American bank, and John Thain, the former head of Merrill Lynch and now the former head of global banking securities and wealth management at Bank of America.   While Mr Diamond will not go to Davos, Marcus Agius, the chairman of Barclays, is still expected to attend the forum.
