The name of the game is greed. And your tax dollars are at work.  While individuals struggle to make ends meet, greedy executives and their companies will use the bailout money to stay very comfortable. E.G. Jay Wintrob, of AIG, earned $2.5 million last year. Other executives will get more than $500,000 to stay through 2009. Peter Kraus of Merrill Lynch will get a golden parachute of $25 million for two months on the job. Capital One Financial CEO Richard Fairbanks: $73.1 million in pay last year. Bank of America chief Kenneth Lewis, $23 million last year.  Neither bank has indicated it will cut CEO pay.  We were told these businesses were losing money, Well, we know where some of it went. So be happy that these greedy people and these businesses were bailed out. Average tax-paying workers like us can rest easy knowing these executives won't be having to tighten their budgets or join the unemployment line.  George Weber, Augusta
