Posted: 3:04 am  January 8, 2009  Bank of America's CEO Ken Lewis started doling out pink slips yesterday to rank and file staffers as part of a plan to slash workers at the Charlotte, N.C.-based financial institution.  Sources told The Post that BofA began laying off staff in the behemoth firm's investment bank and capital markets group as it aims to eliminate as many as 35,000 staffers. It's unclear exactly how many employees were cut.  In early December, Lewis announced that BofA planned to wield the ax liberally over a three-year period as it sought to trim the fat resulting from its merger with Merrill Lynch, which was wrapped up last week.  BofA already cut some 20 or so high-ranking staffers in mid December. However, the bank is now kicking off a deep round of cuts in earnest that are expected to last through the end of the month, sources told The Post. One staffer feared that the layoffs would be a large drain on morale.  Earlier this week, Merrill Lynch's Robert McCann, the private wealth president, resigned and is being replaced by Merrill veteran Dan Sontag.  Lewis is bracing for pretty dour near-term economic conditions, which portends ill for banks of all-stripes. That includes peer institutions JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, which withstood last year's carnage.
