'So let me get this straight. Our Merrill partners lost almost 8 times as much as we did last quarter (half of which seems to have appeared out of nowhere), and yet they still have a 50 / 50 chance of getting our jobs ? Chalk that up as yet another win for them. I think that every Merrill employee should personally line up to kiss John Thain's golden parachute. That man has done wonders for them!'. Merrill lost $15.31bn in the fourth-quarter, taking its 2008 full year pre-tax loss to around $40bn.  And another reader has written in wondering how firms go about selecting who gets the chop. He wonders whether it is just co-incidence that a certain large European bank appears to be axing London-based staff who have been employed for less than 2 years, and thus are cheaper to get rid of.  Finally, The Mail-on-Sunday reports that UK Treasury officials are said to be incensed that Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has a $3.7bn exposure to Russian oligarth Leonid Blavatnik, who owns bankrupt chemical giant LyondellBasell. The monies were originally loaned by ABN Amro, which RBS acquired last year. The deal for ABN Amro, done at the top of the market, is now regarded as one of the worst M&amp;A transactions of all time, and Sir Fred Goodwin, RBS's CEO at the time, has now been dubbed the 'world's worst banker'.
