The Business Review (Albany) - by Mark Calvey  Related News  Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis said in a memo to employees Tuesday that hes recommending the board not award 2008 bonuses to himself and other senior executives.  This was a difficult decision because we have worked hard and made progress on many projects that will create value for our company in future years, Lewis said in the memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Nonetheless, we are a pay-for-performance company.  Lewis is recommending that he and his direct reports not get bonuses for 2008. Other senior executives are likely to receive lower bonuses.  Bank of America is expected to report disappointing quarterly earnings later this month as the recession deepened late in 2008.  Bank of America shares lost two-thirds of their value and the dividend was cut in half last year as the financial turmoil took its toll on the banking industry. Lewis took advantage of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression to buy Merrill Lynch and Countrywide Financial, giving the largest bank in California top franchises in brokerage and mortgage businesses.  Lewis took home $24.8 million in total compensation last year, 11 percent less than in 2007.  Bank of America is the second-largest bank in St. Louis with $7.9 billion in deposits. BofA is one of the largest banks in the Albany, N.Y., area, with 42 branches and $1.3 billion in deposits.
