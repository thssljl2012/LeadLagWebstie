NEW YORK (MarketWatch) - Before its acquisition by Bank of America Corp., Merrill Lynch had its hand in a wide range of businesses including asset management, investment banking and, of course, mortgage securities. While each of those businesses held different values, there was little disagreement about what the most important part of Merrill was: its retail brokerage. Known as the 'thundering herd,' Merrill's retail brokerage was the biggest in the U.S. market. It had 16,000 financial advisers on the ground and the biggest pot of retail investor money on Wall Street. The retail brokerage was the main reason Bank of America (BAC:BACNews , chart , profile , more Last: Delayed quote data Analyst   Create alert Insider   Discuss   Financials Sponsored by:, , ) CEO Ken Lewis decided to spend nearly $50 billion to buy Merrill, even as the target's stock price was tumbling. Bob McCann, who has led the brokerage since 2003, is stepping down, signaling a rift between the new owners and the culture at the acquisition. McCann was the de facto leader of the brokerage arm after Stanley O'Neal was ousted in 2007 and replaced by an outsider, John Thain. See full story. Though Merrill and B of A are likely to cite the deep bench of leadership at the brokerage arm, there's no denying that there are serious obstacles to a comfortable integration. B of A is a commercial bank run on efficiency. Merrill is a Wall Street shop where risk and the ability to land business are rewarded handsomely. McCann also was losing influence in an institution that was becoming one of the biggest in the world - a stark change for someone used to setting the course for a smaller Merrill. His departure says the deal, consummated Jan. 1, isn't working for him. In turn, that tells the rest of the thundering herd, that it may be in their best interests to walk too.
