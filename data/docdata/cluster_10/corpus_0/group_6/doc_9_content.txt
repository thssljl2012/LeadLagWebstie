TPMMuckraker   Talking Points Memo   Merrill Paid Billions In Bonuses, As New Owner Sought More Bailout Dollars  And THEN THEY ASKED FOR MORE BAILOUT MONEY!  And they received.  I can't say "Fuck these guys" loud enough.   It's got stiff competition, but Merrill Lynch may have just wrapped up the prize for the investment bank that best exemplifies Gordon Gekko's famed articulation of the Wall Street creed: "Greed is good."  The Financial Times reports (sub. req.) today that in early December, Merrill, which months earlier had agreed to be bought -- rescued, really -- by Bank of America, decided to pay out $3-4 billions in bonuses.  The bonuses were handed out on an accelerated schedule -- at least a month earlier than in previous years. And they were agreed to just days before Bank of America, realizing how much in toxic assets Merrill had on its books, went to the federal government asking for more taxpayer money to help it digest Merrill -- money that was eventually forthcoming.
