In September, Bank of America wanted to show that, with its acquisition of Merrill Lynch, it knew what it was getting into. Now Bank of America is wants to show it had no idea what it was getting into.  The about-face naturally puts the spotlight on the investment bankers&#8211;Fox-Pitt Kelton and J. Christopher Flowers&#8211;who advised BofA Chief Executive Ken Lewis on the deal. And at the center is Christopher Flowers, a former Goldman Sachs &#038; Co. banker and prominent investor in banks and financial-services firms, who reverted to his old guise of investment banker to advise Bank of America on its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. (Flowers also owns Fox-Pitt Kelton.) It isn&#8217;t unheard-of for investment bankers to advise both buyer and seller. Still, Flowers&#8217; position is somewhat unusual because his familiarity with Merrill Lynch came partly from having kicked its tires on behalf of his own buyout firm just before Bank of America bought it. Now that the Merrill Lynch acquisition has generated $15 billion in unexpected losses in the fourth quarter alone, some are wondering how Lewis&#8211;and Thain&#8211;could have been assured that Merrill was in better shape than expected and should command a $29-a-share acquisition offer. Here are Lewis&#8217;s own words from the September announcement of the deal: &#8220;J.C. Flowers or Chris Flowers is someone weve known for quite some time. We&#8217;ve done several deals with him. We know his firm very well, and it was fortunate that we did because his firmhe and his firm had done quite an amount of due diligence on Merrill Lynch fairly recently, and it was very, very extensive. They had looked at the marks very comprehensively, so this allowed us to have him and team as an adviser, and just update the information they already had. So that was one of the key ingredients to being able to do this as quickly as we did.I will say that Chris [Flowers'] comment was its night and day from the time we first looked at it to now. He was very complimentary of what John [Thain] and his team had done in terms of dramatically reducing the marks, in many cases not onlynot reducing the marks but getting rid of the assets, which is the best thing to do, so a much lower risk profile than he&#8217;d seen earlier on.We actually thought Merrill Lynchs capital structure was very good and had a lot more of a base of common equity than some others we had seen, so it looks good.&#8221;  William Cohan also reported in Fortune here that Lewis had credited Flowers with helping get the deal done: &#8220;&#8216;[Flowers] had done quite an amount of due diligence on Merrill Lynch fairly recently,&#8217; Lewis said. &#8216;It was very, very extensive. They had looked at the marks very comprehensively. This allowed us to have him and his team as an adviser, and just update the information they already had. That was one of the key ingredients to being able to do this as quickly as we did.&#8217; Flowers was very complimentary of what Thain and his team had done in terms of shedding assets including Merrill&#8217;s 25% stake in Bloomberg and a $30.6 billion portfolio of troubled, mortgage-backed securities for 22 cents on the dollar.&#8221; Flowers and FPK provided advice to the Bank of America board and pinpointed the 70% premium that BofA paid, according to Bank of America&#8217;s public filings: Each of FPK and J.C. Flowers also calculated that, based on the exchange ratio and such market prices, the implied value of each share of Merrill Lynch common stock in the merger reflected a premium of 70% to Merrill Lynchs September 12, 2008, closing price on the NYSE, a premium of 8% to Merrill Lynchs one-week closing price on the NYSE, and a 62% discount to Merrill Lynchs fifty-two week high trading price on the NYSE. Flowers received a generous fee for his advice, sharing in a $20 million pot with FPK, which had received $29 million in fees from Merrill Lynch in two years, according to the filings:  Bank of Americas board of directors selected FPK and J.C. Flowers because of their respective expertise, reputation and familiarity with Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, and because their senior professionals have substantial experience in transactions comparable to the merger. As compensation for their services in connection with the merger, Bank of America has agreed to pay FPK and J.C. Flowers fees in an aggregate amount of $20,000,000, of which $5,000,000 was due upon delivery of their respective opinions and the remainder of which is contingent upon the consummation of the merger and related transactions. Over the past two years, FPK and its affiliates have received underwriting compensation from both Bank of America and Merrill Lynch in the approximate aggregate amounts of $3,168,000 and $28,925,000, respectively. Flowers didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. FPK chairman Leonard Caronia declined to comment.
