Jessica Papini reports: Merrill Lynch &#038; Co. is going out with a bang.  When Bank of America, Merrill&#8217;s buyer, announced earnings Friday, it provided preliminary fourth-quarter results on Merrill. Merrill&#8217;s $15.3 billion loss would have been a massive $9.62 per diluted share, according to preliminary numbers.  The fourth quarter would have been the sixth consecutive quarterly loss for the investment bank. For the combined six quarters, Merrill stacked up $39.1 billion in losses.  Bank of America and Merrill Lynch had a shotgun wedding in September, as the financial crisis intensified and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection. Merrill Lynch has been selling off troubled assets for the past few months, and it is difficult to see an end in sight. Now, Bank of America, which also acquired Countrywide Financial last year, has to deal with integrating the two firms, putting its balance sheet in danger. To help close the Merrill acquisition, the government is buying another $20 billion in preferred stock from Bank of America, and will backstop up to $118 billion in toxic assets, three-quarters of which come from Merrill.  &#8220;Bank of America perhaps provided the market with stability with the help of the government to buy Merrill Lynch, but has now created problems of its own,&#8221; said Joseph Battipaglia, head equity strategist for the private-client group at Stifel Nicolaus.  Merrill Lynch, which last reported as an independent company in the third quarter, had dismal preliminary numbers in the fourth quarter. Merrill Lynch had net revenues of negative $12.6 billion. Bank of America said Merrill&#8217;s losses were &#8220;driven by severe capital markets dislocations.&#8221;  It remains to be seen how many more troubled assets will have to be written off Merrill&#8217;s book. &#8220;Everything is unraveling now,&#8221; said Mr. Battipaglia. The residential market, followed by the commercial real-estate market, and the high-yield market, he said.  Merrill Lynch had significant write-downs in the fourth quarter including $1.1 billion in commercial real-estate loans, a $1.7 billion loss on private equity and principal investment holdings, and a $1.9 leveraged finance loss driven by several concentrated commitments.  Merrill&#8217;s commodity business and investment banking remained relatively strong. Investment banking revenue was $718 million, down 4% over the third quarter and global wealth management, which was alluring to Bank of America&#8217;s Chief Executive Ken Lewis, had net revenues of $2.6 billion, as fees held up well despite the declining market.
