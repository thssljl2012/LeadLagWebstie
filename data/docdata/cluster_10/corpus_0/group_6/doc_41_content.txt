AP - Bank of America and the Treasury Department are near an agreement that will provide $15 billion to $20 billion in new government support to the banking giant, a source close to the discussions said Thursday. This source said that the injection of fresh capital will come from the government&#8217;s $700 billion rescue fund and will be similar to assistance provided last November to Citigroup.
