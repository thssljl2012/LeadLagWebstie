Night: Windy Citigroup share prices is still around 3 dollars... have incurred losses. Wonder if I should sell them off or wait. How long should I wait? Will it ever rise to at least 9 bucks? Bank of America share prices are now around 6 dollars.... have also incurred losses. Made impulsive decisions and averaging losses. Who says averaging is the way to go???! It only increases your losses! What stocks should I invest then? Asian Stocks?
