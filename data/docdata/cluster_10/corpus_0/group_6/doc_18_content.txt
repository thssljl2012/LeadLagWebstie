Obama and his advisers are flirting with a bank nationalization.  We are assured that such a nationalization would be temporary in nature, but the impact it would have on our capital markets would be irrevocable.  Once Citi is nationalized, its cost of borrowing plummets. To the extent that it continues to operate (and enabling it to continue to operate is the whole point of nationalizing it), it now has a competitive advantage over non-nationalized banks. Moreover, the assumption is that it will be re-privatized in short order minus its problematic assets  a neat trick that competing banks cant pull off. That gives them a further competitive advantage. Finally, equity shareholders in other banks will have the precedent of the Citi nationalization staring them in the face as they contemplate their own investment. How sure are they that Bank of America, say, will make it if Citi didnt?  The nationalization of Citi makes the failure of the next-weakest large bank vastly more likely for all of the above reasons. But if BofA fails, the effect on the next weakest bank is even more dramatic.  What&#8217;s sad is that I think some in this country (like, oh I don&#8217;t know, Obama and the Democrats) wouldn&#8217;t mind the banks being nationalized at all.  All the better to promote their dream of every single American with a government subsidized mortgage.
