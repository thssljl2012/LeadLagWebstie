Ah, this whole $87 K rug thing just gets better and better. Talking Points Memo has their list of John Thain&#8217;s Top Ten Greatest Moments. My favorite is number five. 5. The In-Retrospect-Ill-Advised Ski Trip In mid December, Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis learns that Merrill&#8217;s fourth quarter losses will be much larger than expected. Lewis gets the bad news not from Thain himself, but from the transition team handling the merger &#8212; perhaps because, after the losses surface, Thain takes off for his ski house in Vail. (A &#8220;person familiar with the matter&#8221; tells the Journal, hilariously, that Thain was &#8220;working and available&#8221; while in Vail.)
