The chairman of Citigroup, Sir Win Bischoff, is to quit next month as the US bank responds to pressure for a change of leadership in the face of mounting alarm about soaring losses on the credit markets.Sir Win, the most senior British banker on Wall Street, announced his departure as leading US financial institutions scrambled to avert a fresh collapse of confidence in their solvency.Senior executives at JP Morgan and Bank of America spent millions of dollars on shares to demonstrate their own long-term optimism. Banking shares bounced higher by between 20% and 30% in New York, reversing a rout in prices on Tuesday.Citigroup's new chairman will be the former Time Warner chief Richard Parsons, who is currently the bank's senior non-executive director. The change is the second high-profile departure this month, swiftly following former treasury secretary Robert Rubin's retirement from Citigroup's board.A former head of Schroders, Bischoff, 66, took the helm of Citigroup in late 2007 when the bank's board ousted its long-serving boss, Charles Prince, as the first signs materialised of the firm's deep exposure to the credit crunch.Along with Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram Pandit, Sir Win initially advocated a strategy of keeping the company intact as an all-round financial supermarket combining high-street banking, investment banking, a brokerage and an asset management arm.But after losing $8.29bn in the final quarter of 2008, Citigroup announced on Friday that it was splitting its operations into two managerial units, to separate high-risk assets from everyday commercial operations.In a memo to employees tonight , Bischoff said he had always envisioned a "limited tenure" as chairman. He acknowledged the "significant losses we and others in our industry have suffered, to the dismay of our shareholders, our people and not least myself". Buthe added: "The heart of Citibank and Citigroup in its many manifestations still beats strongly and the pride that so many of us feel in this fine institution is undiminished."Tuesday's inauguration day collapse in banking stocks had prompted fears that Wall Street could be heading for a repeat of the market meltdown which followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September.But a degree of calm was restored with the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovering to rise 279 to 8,228 points.A regulatory filing revealed that JP Morgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, bought 500,000 shares on Friday at a cost of nearly $11.5m.Similarly, Bank of America's boss, Ken Lewis, bought 200,000 shares yesterday for $1.2m and his boardroom colleagues picked up a further 313,000 shares.Citigroup's stock bounced by 31%, JP Morgan surged by 25%, Bank of America leapt 30% and Goldman Sachs jumped by 18% in yet another day of highly unusual lurches in the market value of institutions once viewed as stable.CitigroupUS economyUnited Statesguardian.co.uk &copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009   Use of this content is subject to our Terms &amp; Conditions   More Feeds
