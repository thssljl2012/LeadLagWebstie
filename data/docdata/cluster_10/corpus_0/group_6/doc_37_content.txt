I am getting close to leaving for Colorado to go skiing.  Will be gone for a few days.  The market at this point on a short term technical basis is oversold.  Once the Citigroup and Bank of America numbers come out I would not be surprised to see a sharp rally tomorrow or into Tuesday (Markets closed n Monday for MLK).  I am not positioning for it.  I think it will be short and do not know for sure it is coming.  We are oversold but if October taught us anything we can become much much more oversold.
