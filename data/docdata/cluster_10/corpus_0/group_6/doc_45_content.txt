Predictions from the start of a year are not a bad place to begin and thanks to my chums at Transact for their view here:  January 2008: the five biggest investment banks in the US are Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Three have disappeared (completely or have been subsumed into another organisation) and none exist solely as investment banks. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the world's largest independent mortgage houses. Now, the US government is the world's largest mortgage house. AIG is the biggest insurance company in the world. Now it is basically an agency of the US government. December, the National Bureau of Economic Research http://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions.html admits that the US has been in recession since December 2007. In the UK, Northern Rock, RBS and Lloyds TSB (and HBOS) have effectively been nationalised.
