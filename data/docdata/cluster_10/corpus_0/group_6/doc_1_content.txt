     &#0160;Ken Lewis paid up for Merrill Lynch, and he knew it, saying as much at the time.&#0160; But it was such a great opportunity!!! However, he may actually have bitten off more than the bank could chew given Merrill's losses, and they nearly didn't go through with the deal telling the folks at the Treasury Department as much in mid-December.&#0160;&#0160; That's when discussions about more funding apparently began.&#0160; And it looks like it's TARP to the rescue,&#0160; potentially ponying up billions more taxpayer funds.&#0160; So thanks Ken Lewis.&#0160; You knew up front that you overpaid for Merrill and now we, the taxpayers, get to foot the bill after the fact.
