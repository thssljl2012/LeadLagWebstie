With its additional $20 billion bailout of Bank of America, the federal goverment becomesthe bank&#8217;sbiggest shareholder. Like everything else it does, the government is terrible at portfolio management. Whereas other investors look for strong companies with earnings growth, the government invests onlyin crappy companies. As of this writing, BOA is trading off 14% since the government announced its latest big investment.Its big stake in Citigroup isn&#8217;t doing so well either.
