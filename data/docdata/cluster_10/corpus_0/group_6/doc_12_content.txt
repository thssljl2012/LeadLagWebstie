STORY: The ax keeps swinging at beleaguered financial giant Citigroup. 52,000 jobs will disappear by way of layoffs, the sale of units, and attrition, the company said on Monday.  And this new target comes on top of the 23,000 jobs already cut through September.  Like many of its peers, Citigroup has lost big on risky home loans gone bad. Citigroup's loss - $20 billion so far this year.   And as CEO Vikram Pandit nears his first year anniversary, investors are losing patience. In a town hall meeting with staff, Pandit outlined plans to slash costs and spend no more than $52 billion next year.    But growing revenues is a different story. Last month Citigroup lost a major opportunity when Wachovia was snapped up by Wells Fargo. Analysts say there are very few buyable banks out there with Wachovia's $418 billion in deposits.   It's been a tough road for investors. Citigroup's stock started 2008 at $29 and late last week it broke below $10. That's the first time the stock has been in the single digits since Citigroup was created in 1998 by the merger of Travelers insurance company and Citibank.   The company is now worth less than $50 billion, barely twice the $25 billion received under the Treasury's $700 bank bailout plan.
