Fund managers can&#8217;t sit on their cash forever.  That is one guiding principle that helped a group of banks, led by J.P. Morgan Chase, find nearly 400 buyers for high-yield, or junk, bonds sold by Cablevision Systems, MetroPCS and Fresenius Medical Systems. They combined timing, aggressively discounted pricing and old-fashioned salesmanship to complete the offerings, according to people familiar with the offerings. The result? Each drew more demand than the underwriters could fill.  Cablevision aimed to raise $500 million in last week&#8217;s sale; it drew $3.5 billion in demand from fund managers and so boosted the offering to $750 million. MetroPCS drew $3.5 billion in demand for this week&#8217;s offering of $300 million of debt; banks increased the size to $550 million. And Fresenius drew $5.5 billion in demand for a planned $650 million offering, which encouraged the banks to raise that to $800 million.  The banks on the Cablevision deal included J.P. Morgan as the lead bookrunner along with Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse Group and Deutsche Bank. On the MetroPCS deal, J.P. Morgan again led, while Bank of America and HSBC Holdings were bookrunners. On Fresenius, J.P. Morgan led a U.S. offering, while Deutsche Bank led a simultaneous offering in Europe. Credit Suisse and BNP were bookrunners.  Deal Journal broke down how the banks used timing, pricing and strategy to sell the bonds. Why? Because while investor receptivity to such deals is no guarantee that the high-yield markets will stay open, it does show increased investor tolerance for debt. That could be a boon to companies waiting for the credit markets to open in order to finance mergers and acquisitions. Timing: At the end of the year, fund managers&#8211;like everyone else&#8211;get nervous about performance and bonuses. As a result, they tend to sit on their investments and hoard cash. That has been especially true in the credit crisis. Fund managers froze up from September to December, particularly buyers of high-yield bonds, as prices in the market were so low it wasn&#8217;t worth selling anything in their portfolios. But weak markets meant the value of their holdings was largely declining, raising the percentage of cash at many funds to as much as 10% of the total portfolio. Of course, cash doesn&#8217;t generate returns. So J.P. Morgan surmised that fund managers would increase their appetite for deals in January, according to people familiar with the matter. &#8220;The inclination to spend becomes a huge catalyst the more that cash gets built up at these firms. We thought that 10% cash is a very high balance, and we thought it was untenable,&#8221; said a person close to the situation. Pricing: Banks are kind of like retailers: to sell inventory, they sometimes have to offer discounts. At the height of the financial crisis last fall, high-yield bonds were selling at prices that baffled veterans&#8211;as low as 22 cents on the dollar. That caused potential sellers to wait for higher prices&#8211;and buyers to wait until prices fell. Knowing that a compromise had to be made, the banks strategically priced the yields on the three offerings at least one percentage point higher than where each company&#8217;s debt was trading in the markets. Because prices move inversely to yields, that meant it would cost investors less to buy the new debt than it did to buy existing bonds. &#8220;Nothing changed at Cablevision in a day, but you could still buy new bonds cheaper than the ones already there,&#8221; said one person familiar with the offering. Cablevision&#8217;s bonds sold at 88.8 cents on the dollar to yield 11.35%; MetroPCS&#8217;s offering was priced at 89.5 cents on the dollar to yield 11.8%, and Fresenius&#8217; two offerings were priced at about 93 cents on the dollar to yield 10.25% to 10.5%. Such yields might seem high, but yields at the end of last year had rocketed as high as 16.5%.  Salesmanship: The underwriters reached out to just a few hedge funds. Instead, they looked for buyers among asset managers, insurers and other investors. Even so, getting a deal done was as much a numbers game as anything else. J.P. Morgan called all 300 of its high-yield customers to sell each deal. The banks only modestly increased the size of the offerings in the face of even stronger demand, because they wanted to create even more demand by giving the impression that the deals were popular; the lower supply would force some fund managers to buy more bonds after they started trading, which would boost prices. &#8220;If you ask me for $100 million of high-yield bonds, and I actually fill the entire order, it will scare the hell out of you,&#8221; explained a person close to the deal. &#8220;So I don&#8217;t allocate the full amount to anybody unless I&#8217;m absolutely desperate.&#8221; In the end, there were 150 buyers for the Cablevision bonds, 125 for MetroPCS, and 175 for Fresenius. The underwriters held conference calls to find buyers for the Cablevision and MetroPCS offerings, but went on a roadshow&#8211; in-person visits with fund managers&#8211;to sell the Fresenius bonds.
