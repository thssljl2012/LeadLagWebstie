Wachovia Bank has been bought by Wells Fargo and the airwaves are full of commercials saying that Wachovia is Wells Fargo. However, if a Wells Fargo customer goes into a Wachovia branch, he or she will no more be able to make a transaction than a Citibank or HSBC customer. This is a casualness with accuracy which we should not expect from a bank or any major corporation. Just saying "is" does not make it so!
