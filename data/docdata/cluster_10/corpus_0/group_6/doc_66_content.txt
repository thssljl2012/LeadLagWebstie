Citi Throws Weight Behind Cram-Downs By PAUL JACKSON January 9, 2009 In a move that clearly caught much of the financial and mortgage markets by surprise late Thursday, Citigroup, Inc. (C: 6.75 -5.73%) agreed with key legislators on a plan that would allow bankruptcy judges to modify the terms of mortgages during debt restructuring. The move is a surprising break from the financial industrys long-standing and strong stance against allowing so-called mortgage debt cram-downs. Citi Throws Weight Behind Cram-Downs : HousingWire    financial news for the mortgage market. Tom here - I highly recommend you read the entire article that Paul wrote about cramdowns and Citibank. Here&amp;#8217;s the two main reasons you should be concerned about them:  It&amp;#8217;s long been conceded that instituting a cram-down legislation (where a bankruptcy court can change the principal amount of a mortgage) will cause higher rates. Why? Because suddenly there&amp;#8217;s a new dynamic in the equation and there&amp;#8217;s the likelihood that the principal amount of mortgages is not what they originally planned. When there&amp;#8217;s an added element of uncertainty, then there&amp;#8217;s an added element of risk. Added risk equals higher rates.  Tom here with an update. Read this article at Bloomberg and you&amp;#8217;ll see that it only applies to existing loans. Therefore, I don&amp;#8217;t think it was have a huge impact on mortgage rates going forward. However we&amp;#8217;ll need to watch and make sure that doesn&amp;#8217;t become an issue.  If you read what Paul wrote, I think there&amp;#8217;s a very interesting and disturbing link between what is being proposed and the fact that Citibank has a $306 Billion loan guarantee from you and me. There will be additional losses to the bank because of the cramdown rules and Citi was the first to agree to them. Why? Is it because Citi won&amp;#8217;t have to pay for them, we will?   This isn&amp;#8217;t the last that we&amp;#8217;ll be hearing about cramdowns, that&amp;#8217;s for sure. What do you think?
