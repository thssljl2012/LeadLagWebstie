After redirecting $15 billion from taxpayers directly to executives as bonuses--just weeks ago--Former Merrill Lynch chief executive John Thain will resign from Bank of America effective today.http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28793175/Merrill paid out about the same bonus amount as the money it lost in the second half of CY2007--$12 billion.  Good work, boys!Also, more extravagance is reported, such as a $87,000 for a rug (a rug!) and $35,000 for a 'portable commode' (!)Now's the time when we need some big populist senator to haul his ass to Congress.
