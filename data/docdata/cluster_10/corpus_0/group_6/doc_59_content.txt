Among those getting dragged down with the banks Friday were credit-card giants Visa and Mastercard, and both companies were seeing frenzied activity in the options market as investors put money down in the hopes of a quick profit by the end of the day, when monthly options expire. Earlier in the session, KeyBanc analyst Anurag Rana downgraded Visa, MasterCard and Heartland Payment Systems to neutral from buy, citing big declines in card purchase volume at Bank of America, Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase.  &#8220;Based on this spending data, volume declines could be more substantial than what we believed were our conservative assumptions,&#8221; Mr. Rana writes. For example, for MasterCard, we were forecasting a U.S. credit/charge volume decline of 5% in 2009, but in light of JP Morgan&#8217;s 7.6% charge volume decline, Bank of America&#8217;s 17% credit card purchase volume decline, and Citi&#8217;s 15% purchase sales decline in North America, this decline could be greater.&#8221;  Shares of Visa fell 7% to $45.90 a share while Mastercard was off 4.1% a share, and Heartland was down by 4.5%. The options activity reflects a bet that the stocks are going to worsen dramatically by the end of the day, and given the market&#8217;s recent history, that&#8217;s not out of the question. According to Frederic Ruffy, options strategist at Whatstrading.com, the activity in Visa is already three times as large as the usual average by this point in the session, and Mastercard options activity doubles the usual.  More than 3,500 Visa put options at the $45 strike have changed hands, exceeding open interest of 3,054 contracts, suggesting new positions. The options are trading at 20 cents each, so the stock would have to hit $44.80 in order for such a bet to be profitable.  &#8220;At one point they shot up to 70 cents, and the stock never went below $45.21,&#8221; says Bill Lefkowitz, chief options strategist at vFinance Investments. &#8220;People are looking for a disastrous day in these companies and would just be all on fallout from the banks.&#8221;  Mastercard activity was similar in its bearishness. More than 3,000 put options at the $120 strike price changed hands, but the price at that strike declined, suggesting sellers who believe that at $124.20, an additional move of $4.20 is unlikely.
