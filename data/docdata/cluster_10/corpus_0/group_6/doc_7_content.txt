Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis is recommending to his board that he and his top executives not receive bonuses for 2008, according to an internal memo Lewis sent to BofA employees Tuesday. A bank spokesman confirms the authenticity of the memo. In the memo, Lewis said the decision was difficult, given that some of the companys 2008 accomplishments  such as its recent purchase of Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. Inc.  will create value in future years. But he expects BofAs full-year performance to fall short of expectations. The banks stock price dropped 66 percent in 2008. And with its third-quarter earnings, the company said it would cut its dividend 50 percent. Charlotte Business Journal This is a P.R. move. I think most people realize that. I&amp;#8217;m certainly not going to complain about it, though. In the same respect, I am not going to shower Mr. Lewis with praise either. He and his top level staff may be foregoing their millions in bonuses for this past year, but they&amp;#8217;ve already bent over everyone in America when they accepted billions in TARP money, OUR money, from the Feds. And always, as a reminder, your local Charlotte Congress critters Mel Watt (D-NC-12) and Sue Myrick (R-NC-9) voted to give BofA your money.
