No conflict if interest here. Nope. None. The Pacific Investment Management Company has been hired to advise the U.S. government on the value of $118 billion of assets guaranteed in the bailout of Bank of America Are they advising the government or Bank of America? Surprisingly, PIMCO doesn&#8217;t support nationalization. You don&#8217;t fucking say! Previously: it seems the US government goes to PIMCO (the biggest bond investor on the planet) on how to solve the credit/bond market issues and PIMCO is &#8220;perfectly&#8221; positioned for the bailouts - that they essentially advocate. Imagine that. It is sort of like Government Sachs of the West Coast.
