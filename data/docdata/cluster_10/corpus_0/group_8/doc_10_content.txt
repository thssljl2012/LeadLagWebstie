 John Gavin of Disclosure Insight has written a letter to FASB opposing its proposal to refine mark-to-market rules. Like John, I hope FASB sees the light. It has been said that changing MTM rules would be like giving inmates keys to their own prison. Seems to me banks already have keys&#8212;to their own cells certainly, and to every other door inside the prison. After all, they have wide latitude to mark most assets to model (level 2) or to myth (level 3). Modifying mark-to-market gives them the key to the front gate as well. From John: Our letter includes&#8230;a study we published only about 10 days ago entitled, &#8220;Bank Goodwill Impairment Study.&#8221; Using goodwill as a proxy for overall balance sheet integrity, we found reason to question the&#8230;balance sheets for at least 70% of 50 of the largest banks trading in the US. That&#8217;s largely because a full 70% did not impair goodwill (at all) at year-end despite a significant percentage of them trading below book and even tangible book values (we called Bank of America the poster child in that regard and provide analysis of why their $80+ billion in goodwill is desperately in need of impairment). This is the list of all the people/entities that have submitted comments to the FASB thus far. No surprise here, the majority are from the banks who have clearly organized themselves to keep the heat on the FASB. Ours is letter #38. It appears we are the only independent investment research firm taking a stand on this. The study attached to the letter (pages 4-15) includes some great data tables. I highly recommend it.
