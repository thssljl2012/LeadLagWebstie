     Lawyers for Merrill Lynch/Bank of America said that if the disclosed which employees who were paid $3.6 billion in bonuses just before Merrill Lynch merged with Bank of America, it will cause "grave and irreparable harm." (Read: it would be bad for business and the recipients will get their asses kicked.)Bloomberg reports:Bank of America today filed documents in state court in Manhattan to intervene in a case brought by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to compel former Merrill Chief Executive Officer John Thain to testify about the bonus recipients.   Neither the individual names nor the job titles bear any reasonable or relevant relationship to Cuomos investigation, the firms argued in the documents. Nor is there a reasonable or relevant reason to disclose such information to the general public. Right. Except, who was it paying for the bailout again?
