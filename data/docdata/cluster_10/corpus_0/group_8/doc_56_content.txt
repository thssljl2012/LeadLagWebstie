 Look what BAC CEO Ken Lewis had to say today:Bank of Americas request for $20bn of government money to prop up its acquisition of Merrill Lynch was a tactical mistake that made the bank appear as weak as Citigroup, Ken Lewis, BofAs chief executive told the Financial Times on Monday...BoA received an initial $25bn from the Treasury in September. It requested a further $20bn at the end of December as the scale of Merrills losses eclipsed BofAs initial forecasts.In hindsight, it was a tactical mistake because it put us in the same category as Citigroup, said Mr Lewis. We could still have had 8 per cent tier 1 capital after a $15bn loss but we wanted a cushion.Mr Lewis said that it would have been better to request only $10bn for that purpose. He said that could have helped to curtail investor fears that further problems were in the offing.http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/50000286-074f-11de-9294-000077b07658.htmlThen give the $10 billion back!
