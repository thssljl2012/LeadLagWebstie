   &#8230;Much of the debate is semantic. But underneath it are at least two big issues. Who bears losses? How does one best restructure banks?  Banks are us. Often the debate is conducted as if they can be punished at no cost to ordinary people. But if they have made losses, someone has to bear them. In effect, the decision has been to make taxpayers bear losses that should fall on creditors. Some argue that shareholders should be rescued, too. But, rightly, this has not happened: share prices have indeed collapsed. That is what shareholders are for.  Yet the overwhelming bulk of banking assets are financed through borrowing, not equity. Thus the decision to keep creditors whole has huge implications. If we accept Mr Bernanke&#8217;s definition of &#8220;nationalisation&#8221; as a decision to &#8220;wipe out private shareholders&#8221;, we can call this activity &#8220;socialisation&#8221;.  What are its pros and cons?  &#8230;The four biggest US commercial banks &#8211; JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and Wells Fargo &#8211; possess 64 per cent of the assets of US commercial banks (see chart). If creditors of these businesses cannot suffer significant losses, this is not much of a market economy.  Typically excellent analysis by Martin Wolf. Holders of bank credit (like us) are just a bit interested in this question&#8230;
