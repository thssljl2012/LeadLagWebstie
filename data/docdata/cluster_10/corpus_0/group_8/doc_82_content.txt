Citigroup Inc. demanded that Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Wachovia Corp. terminate a $15.1 billion takeover agreement announced today, saying it breached an exclusive deal that Citigroup reached earlier this week.                                                                                      Wells Fargo's deal to take over Wachovia, based in Charlotte, N.C., would be worth $15.1 billion.       Citigroup dropped as much as 15 percent in New York trading after Wells Fargo said it would buy Wachovia in an all-stock transaction. Citigroup announced a $2.16 billion offer for parts of the company four days ago.         "Citi has substantial legal rights regarding Wachovia and this transaction," the company said in a statement. "Wachovia's agreement to a transaction with Wells Fargo is in clear breach of an exclusivity agreement between Citi and Wachovia."         The Citigroup deal, which included assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., would have pushed Citi to third place among U.S. bank networks, behind Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase. The proposal didn't include Wachovia's brokerage and mutual-fund businesses.         "Citigroup loses an attractive, accretive deal, complete with government assistance," David Trone, an analyst with Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller in New York, said today. "The deal was struck at the eleventh hour and clearly had not been formally completed."         "The FDIC stands behind its previously announced agreement with Citigroup," FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said. "The FDIC will be reviewing all proposals and working with the primary regulators of all three institutions to pursue a resolution that serves the public interest."                                           U.S. bank regulators said they haven't evaluated Wells Fargo's deal.         The Wells Fargo transaction values Wachovia at $7 a share, the companies said in a joint statement.         "It provides superior value compared to the previous offer to acquire only the banking operations of the company," Richard Kovacevich, 64, chairman of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, said in a statement. "Wachovia shareholders will have a meaningful opportunity to participate in the growth and success of a combined Wachovia-Wells Fargo that will be one of the world's great financial services companies."         Wachovia shareholders get 0.1991 shares of Wells Fargo common stock for each share they own. Wells Fargo expects charges related to the acquisition of about $10 billion, and the company said it will issue as much as $20 billion of new securities, mostly common stock.         Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the company headed by Omahan Warren Buffett, is now Wells Fargo's biggest shareholder, owning about 9 percent of the stock.         Wells Fargo said it would acquire all of Wachovia's businesses, preferred equity and banking deposits. Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins said in the statement that the acquisition will add to earnings per share by the third year after completion and should produce an internal rate of return of at least 15 percent.
