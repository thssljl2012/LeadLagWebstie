Considering what he's been through in the past 14 months, John Thain may regret the day he left his old job running the New York Stock Exchange.    And this could only make it hurt worse: Duncan Niederauer, Thain's successor as CEO of NYSE Euronext, received a 21 percent bump in total compensation last year, despite the fact that the exchange swung to a loss and its share price fell by 80 percent.   According to an SEC filing on Monday, the NYSE Euronext paid Niederauer $9.2 million in total compensation for the year. The package included a $4 million cash and equity performance bonus. He was supposed to receive $5 million, but the company cut its bonus pool by 20 percent to reflect the adverse business conditions.   The NYSE Euronext lost $738 million in 2008, compared to a profit of $643 million in 2007. Niederauer has aggressively cut costs and launched new initiatives while the company continues to digest its recent acquisition of Euronext.   Of course, even though John Thain didn't get the $10 million bonus he allegedly wanted from Merrill Lynch for orchestrating its sale to Bank of America, he was still well compensated for jumping ship from the NYSE. He was among the highest paid CEOs in 2007 with $83 million in compensation and his salary for 2008 likely dwarfed Neiderauer's.   by Megan BarnettRelated LinksThe Taming of Merrill LynchExchange-Traded Derivatives: Why Stop at CDS?Mattresses Officially Overstuffed
