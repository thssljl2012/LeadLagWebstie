State and federal regulators seized a Loganville-based bank Friday &amp;mdash; making it the third Georgia-based financial institution to fail this year and 20th nationwide amid the economic downslide. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said The Community Bank's total deposits of $611.4 million will be acquired by the Bank of Essex in Tappahannock, Va. Bank of Essex paid a $3.2 million premium for those deposits, and the FDIC predicted the seizure would cost the Deposit Insurance Fund between $200 million and $240 million. Bank of Essex also purchased $84.4 million of the $681 million in total assets The Community Bank had on its books. The FDIC will keep the remaining assets to dispose of later.
