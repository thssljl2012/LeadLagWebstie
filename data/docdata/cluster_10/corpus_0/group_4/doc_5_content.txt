      Not looking good for one of the largest mortgage lenders in the country.via ClickOnDetroit.comDETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said the troubled mortgage industry and frozen credit markets have raised doubts that the mortgage business of its GMAC financial arm can survive.The automaker said Monday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that market developments have raised substantial doubt about the viability of Residential Capital LLC.The filing said the value of Residential Capital's mortgage loans have deteriorated due to weak housing prices, delinquencies and defaults. It also is having trouble raising capital.GM owns 49 percent of GMAC LLC.GM also says in the filing that Delphi Corp., its former parts-making operation that was spun off in 1999, may not be able to emerge from bankruptcy protection.GM shares hit a 62-year low after being downgraded by analysts. The stock closed down $1 at $3.36 after sinking as low as $3.02.Ford was down nine cents and closed at $1.93, while Toyota was up 63 cents and closed at $69.15.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Said the Bush administration should consider expanding the $700 billion bailout to include carmakers.The Big Three could receive about $50 billion in bridge loans.Michigan Congressman John Dingell criticized the Bush administrations move to pump more of the allocated $700 billion bailout money into AIG Insurance Company.The Treasury Departments decision to assist AIG may or may not be necessary to the overall health of our economy, but one thing is certain: as the federal government continues to help prop up Wall Street, it cannot afford to ignore main street and blue collar jobs," said Dingell.Dingell said the domestic automakers should receive some of that money."While AIG may employ 100,000 people worldwide, GM, Ford and Chrysler directly employ more than double that number here in the U.S. In fact, one in 10 U.S. jobs are tied to the domestic automobile industry and is said to support around five million jobs across all fifty states."Not good at all.To Top Of Main PageLabels: Big Three, Collapse, Credit Crisis, Real Estate Industry
