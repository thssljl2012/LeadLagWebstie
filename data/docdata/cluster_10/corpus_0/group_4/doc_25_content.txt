Bought put options on Citigroup and Bank of America Tuesday...puts on Citigroup sold too early (unbelievable, C dropped to single digit in a matter of a few days), only made a little bit money on Citi puts, but kept Bank of America puts till this noon, sold all of them at almost perfect bottom! market tumbled, put prices rocketed! the prices were changing so fast, in a few seconds, i earned $300 less..but still sold at a very good price. I should have bought call options on SP500 index immediately after I sold all of my puts and then could have caught the upward reversal..lack of experience...wrote down notes tonight, next time hope to catch both sides of the trend...If so, the return should have been 400% or above!
