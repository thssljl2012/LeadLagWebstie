It's two months into Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.'s historic bankruptcy, and hundreds of creditors are still complaining about the unprecedented lack of transparency in the case. Since the outset, asset sales have been rushed through the bankruptcy court with little or no notice, and creditors are still trying to get to the bottom of a series of cash sweeps among dozens of Lehman's affiliates immediately before and after the 3 a.m. filing on Sept. 15. Some creditors say they don't even know where their money is and where to pursue a claim.But one creditor, at least, has only itself to blame for money lost within Lehman's black hole. Deutsche Bank AG has sued Lehman in an attempt to recover $72.5 million that it accidentally transferred to Lehman more than a week after the bankruptcy filing.  In the suit, filed on Tuesday with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, Deutsche said it meant to transfer the money to Bank of America NA, but due to a "clerical error," the funds ended up at Lehman.  Lehman has refused to return the money, according to the complaint, because Deutsche owes Lehman and its affiliates at least $290 million. - John Blakeley
