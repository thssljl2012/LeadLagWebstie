Corporations are buying other corporations all the time, domestically and internationally. The best consolidation of data suggests that more than half of mergers and acquisition don't work.  The toughest question to ask, other than the one that has to be asked before the buyout/merger (can we fit together?) is whether to absorb the new entity or keep it separate. Keep it separate means to leave the main staff in place with its own human resources department and existing personnel practices.The question comes up with the recent bank acquisitions: Bank of America/Countrywide/Merrill, J.P.Morgan Chase/WAMU, Wells Fargo/Wachovia.&amp;#0160; I have a gut feeling about each of these mergers because I was a financial person in an early part of my life and I dealt with each of these organizations.To me the key question is: can the leader of the merged entity be replaced by a horizontal transfer or does it have to be an internal promotion.&amp;#0160; Make the wrong choice and fail.The cases where I have seen merger/acquisitions succeed and fail have been where banks took over other types of financial organizations such as investment banks, mortgage banks, savings and loans, stock brokerages, sub-prime lenders, other banks, leasing companies, personal loan companies and trust companies.   The first part of this list investment banks, mortgage banks, savings and loans, stock brokerages and sub-prime lenders have been mostly failures from my experience and the latter part have been mostly successful.&amp;#0160; The reason is that the acquiring bank can move its own people into management of the types of business in the latter part of the list and the managers will have enough experience to succeed in the new entity,The failures of the first part of the types of business list arise immediately if the effort is based on absorption, since no one in the acquiring bank is likely to know the new company's business...and management is not a ubiquitous tool, it is a highly context specific skill.&amp;#0160;   Where the merged entity is kept separate and promotion occurs from within the merged company the merger can work under one condition: the merged entity must report directly to the acquirers Board of Directors. In essence that is how a diversified company such as GE works.&amp;#0160; The internal knowledge of a merged company must be preserved as a distinctly separate entity for the company to function.&amp;#0160; The best thinking on this subject is Henry Mintzberg: Mintzberg on Management.My opinion on the three bank mega mergers mentioned above: Wells will do best; B of A might succeed with Countrywide but not with the Merrill Lynch part of the acquisition; I doubt the whole J.P.Morgan cluster will stay together.
