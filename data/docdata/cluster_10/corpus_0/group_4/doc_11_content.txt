First caveat -- I am not a bankruptcy lawyer. &amp;nbsp;All I know about Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 is what I read in the newspapers. &amp;nbsp; But I think the best option for carmakers -- and for the federal government -- is to let GM go into Chapter 11 bankruptcy. &amp;nbsp;Robert Reich had a good blog entry on this last week: When a big company that gets into trouble is more valuable living than dead, there used to be a well-established legal process for reorganizing it - called chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. Under it, creditors took some losses, shareholders even bigger ones, some managers' heads rolled. Companies cleaned up their books and got a fresh start. And taxpayers didn't pay a penny. So why, exactly, is the Treasury substituting government bailouts for chapter 11? Even if you assume Wall Street's major banks and insurance giant AIG are so important to the national and global economy that they can't be allowed to fail, that doesn't mean they have to be bailed out. They could be reorganized under bankruptcy protection. True, their creditors, shareholders, and executives would take bigger hits than they're taking now that taxpayers are bailing them out. But they're the ones who took the risk. We didn't. The Treasury seems to have lost sight of its real client. Its client is not the creditors, shareholders, or executives of any of these firms. Its sole client is the American people. It would be different if Main Street was getting something out of all this. But credit still isn't flowing to small businesses or distressed homeowners, and unemployment is skyrocketing. There's more at stake for Main Street when it comes to General Motors and other automakers now teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, because two and a half million households depend directly or indirectly on them for their paychecks. But the best way to protect all these people is not to pay off the automakers' creditors, shareholders, and executives, with no strings attached. Recall that when the government bailed out Chrysler in the early 1980s, a third of its employees lost their jobs. In exchange for government aid, the Big Three's creditors, shareholders, and executives should be required to accept losses as large as they'd endure under chapter 11, and the UAW should agree to some across-the-board wage and benefit cuts. The resulting savings, combined with the bailout, should be enough to allow the Big Three to shift production to more fuel efficient cars while keeping almost all its current workforce employed. Ideally, major parts suppliers would adhere to the same conditions. Remember: The underlying goal is to help Americans through this crisis and come out of it with a stronger economy. And what a tragedy it would be if the government spends so much on these bailouts there isn't enough money left for the next administration to help average people get affordable health insurance, send their kids to good schools, and find good jobs -- including jobs rebuilding the nation's crumbling infrastructure and finding alternative sources of energy. It's not the big guys who need rescuing. It's the small. Right now, the government has its priorities upside down. http://robertreich.blogspot.com/ And that's where more and more commentators come down. &amp;nbsp;Just take this sampling from the New York Times today... One of the best summaries of why Chapter 11 would be best is found in http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11... where Andrew Sorkin starts by noting that the $10 billion that GM wants would be gone by February at current rates. &amp;nbsp;He recommends a bankruptcy in which a scaled-down GM merges with a scaled-down Chrysler, the two companies discard brands, coming down to Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick, Jeep, and some version of Chevy and GMC and Dodge RAM that would produce a line of pickups. &amp;nbsp;Thousands of auto workers would lose their jobs, but thousands more would keep them. &amp;nbsp;Auto workers' average compensation package -- including health care and retirement -- is presently $70 an hour. &amp;nbsp;That translates into $140,000 a year, take-home. &amp;nbsp;That would get scaled back -- something that can be done in Bankruptcy Court but not outside of it. &amp;nbsp;The executives who drove the companies into the ditch would have to find another business to fail in; they could be given the boot in Bankruptcy Court. &amp;nbsp;Shareholders would lose their equity, but that's how markets work. &amp;nbsp; The primary argument that is being used against forcing GM into bankruptcy is that "Chapter 11 reorganization inevitably leads to Chapter 7 liquidation." &amp;nbsp;Sales would plummet, because who wants to buy a car under a warranty that seems likely to outlast the company giving the warranty? &amp;nbsp; The subtext is -- don't put us in bankruptcy because the Bankruptcy Court has the power to: ** &amp;nbsp;Restructure labor contracts, including the best health-care plan in the country ** &amp;nbsp;Eliminate or greatly reduce pension obligations ** &amp;nbsp;Restructure contracts with suppliers and dealerships ** &amp;nbsp;Force creditors to accept pennies on the dollar for the debts ** &amp;nbsp;Eliminate what shareholder equity remains In other words, no one wants bankruptcy because it's going to hurt. &amp;nbsp;Which is really kind of the idea, isn't it? In http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11... , the author reflects on the attempt by the government of Great Britain to prop up the failing British Leyland. &amp;nbsp;The British government spent $16.5 billion (inflation adjusted) and still the company burned through the money and went into bankruptcy in 2005. &amp;nbsp;By then the business was too far gone, and despite earlier protestations that British Leyland was too important to the British economy (or psyche) to be allowed to fail, it not only failed, but it was split up and its car lines sold to other companies. &amp;nbsp;Jaguar and Land Rover were sold to an Indian consortium, and MG was sold to the Chinese, and British Leyland was no more. &amp;nbsp;The lessons? &amp;nbsp;Don't throw good money after bad. &amp;nbsp;No business is "too big to fail." &amp;nbsp;Life goes on. In http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11... , the author notes that the estimates of economic doom and gloom should one of the Big Three fail do not take into account the reality that there are other car manufacturers in the United States; Honda and Toyota and Nissan, for example, all make cars in this country, and if they had the opportunity to sell more, many of those parts makers and tire sellers and dealerships now associated with GM would probably be able to re-associate with one of those companies. Auto executives are testifying today and tomorrow before Congressional committees considering their bailout proposal. &amp;nbsp;It should be interesting.
