Hooooooo boy. The American financial crisis is deepening. Bank of America&amp;#8217;s stock is getting killed. It&amp;#8217;s now in the teens and heading lower&amp;#8230;and BAC is supposed to be one of the good ones! To make matters worse, I&amp;#8217;m already 100% invested. I bought on the way down, but I didn&amp;#8217;t think it would KEEP going down. Not this long, and especially not this much. All I can do is hold my nose until we come out of this. God help us all.
