For over a month, I have given you the names of companies on my due diligence list &amp;#8212; Bank of America, Citgroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Heinz, Campbells, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson andProctor &amp;amp; Gamble. With many of these now trading at very nice lows due to the pullback in the market, I&amp;#8217;m finding some of these names somewhat irresistible to snatch-up a piece of &amp;#8212; even though I have an eye towards mid-February next year as being a prime buying time. But you know the score &amp;#8230; Don&amp;#8217;t base any of your investment decisions on any of my ramblings &amp;#8212; do your own due diligence &amp;#8212; or at least enough research to pick the right professional to do it for you.
