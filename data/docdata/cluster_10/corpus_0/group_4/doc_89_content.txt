From portfolio.com..."America, we have a problem. Citigroup is the largest bank in America,with a balance sheet of over $2 trillion -- and it's also the mostdysfunctional. Since Vikram Pandit took over, Citi has lost not only$20 billion but also more than 70% of its market capitalization,making it now worth significantly less than, say, Genentech....Citi might well turn out to be Hank Paulson's largest and biggest headache."http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/11/13/citis-desperate-straits?tid=true
