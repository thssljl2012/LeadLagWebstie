The other big trade was the economy. As the U.S. and global economy slows down, retailers, techs and a variety of materials and industrials will suffer. Investors showed their concerns over the economy today, hammering down many of these stocks down.Here are a few big losers from today:Financials - obviously, financials depended on the bailout plan more than others, at least in the immediate future: Bank of America Corp.
