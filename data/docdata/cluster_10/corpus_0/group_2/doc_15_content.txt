I just heard from one of my many friends at Nokia, Lauri Hirvonen, who coordinates Nokia's interests with Dot Mobi. He had some fresh numbers. Dot Mobi has already sold a million domain names and is now the fastest-growing web domain category. A good example of who is doing it, is Bank of America, whose bofa.mobi site has enabled the Bank to connect with a million of its customers already..&amp;nbsp; Yeah, this is a cool and dynamic industry to be in..&amp;nbsp; Thanks Lauri for hte update, keep up the great with Dot Mobi.
