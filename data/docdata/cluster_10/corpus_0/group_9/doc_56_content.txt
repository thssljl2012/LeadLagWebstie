 Was Bank of America Entrapped I dont really think this is what happened. I think that Bank of America may have had deep ties to Merrill Lynch and eventually decided to buy the company in order to have an actual, fully experienced, well known investment bank under its wing. After making the deal, the financial crisis hit and Bank of America was probably told they could keep Merrill and still get bailout funds. If the Treasury and the Fed told them to keep Merrill Lynch, I think there definitely had to be some deep links between the two companies. In other words, Merrills fall would cause problems at Bank of America. In any case, this has now turned into some detective story. It sounds very strange that two high profile people actually force another high profile person to do anything it didnt want to do. Cuomo in New York:  Now, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has revealed that Mr. Lewis said the Treasury secretary at the time, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, put pressure on him to complete the Merrill merger while keeping quiet about the losses until an additional government bailout. This raises serious questions whether the government caused the company to violate the federal securities laws. Notice that this is not a federal official. It is NY State Attorney General Mario Cuomo. Im not saying that Lewis would lie to him, I just think he might tell the story in a way that Cuomo would not understand. I think he should really talk to the SEC or whoever overseas the mergers of the companies. I still think that Lewis wanted to add Merrill Lynch to Bank of America. After all, Citigroup had purchased Smith Barney, also another old investment bank. It was a competitive movebuy an actual investment bank and avoid reinventing the wheel. I think Cuomo should really let the Feds handle this one.
