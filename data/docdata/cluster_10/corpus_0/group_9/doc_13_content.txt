Up until about 2006 or so, to work at J.P. Morgan Chase was to experience the feeling that you were part of the blanding of banking.        In Wall Street's testosterone-fueled pecking order, the company's name might have evoked prestige of the past, but it lost that after it merged with Chase Manhattan in 2000. The esprit de corps of the place was all but obliterated, even if the pay was still pretty good.        In other words, it certainly was no Goldman Sachs. I worked at Goldman for two years after college. Despite perhaps being the most unenthusiastic investment banker in history&mdash;I'd had my Jack Kerouac moment around the time I was offered the job, and accepted it only because I had student loans to repay&mdash;I actually liked working there. Why? Not because I liked what I did. Rather, it was because I had a job that I knew so many other people would kill for.        Even after the downturn started, the media was still awash in stories about how Goldman Sachs was a modern-day version of the Illuminati, all but secretly controlling the government, and, thorough its foresight and power, crushing its competition with apparent nonchalance. Goldman employees were different than the rest of us.        In a word, they were, well, better.        But something has changed, at least in the status perceptions of Wall Streeters. Goldman Sachs is no longer the Goldman Sachs of the financial world. J.P. Morgan Chase is.        Sure, Goldman reported blockbuster results in April and followed them with an in-your-face equity offering of $5 billion that was intended to help pay back TARP funds from the government.        But pay no heed. This is not the Goldman of times past. That's because J.P. Morgan chief Jamie Dimon has navigated the shoals of the economic and financial crisis so adeptly that it is his bank, and not Goldman, against which all others are now compared. Let us count the ways.        In the first quarter of 2009, J.P. Morgan's investment bank led the industry's much watched "league tables" in the most important capital-raising categories. More companies raised debt and equity through J.P. Morgan than anyone else.        While Goldman Sachs claimed to have won the mergers and acquisitions footrace, they had to perform a sleight of hand to get there, changing the criteria from deals that were announced during the quarter to deals that were actually completed. Most Wall Street firms play with the inputs to try and find a way to claim they're No. 1. Goldman never used to, but they're doing it now.        When Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley decided&mdash;while fearing for their own existence&mdash;to transform themselves into bank holding companies in September (bringing with it the ability to access the Federal Reserve's discount window), they essentially brought to an end the era of the standalone investment bank.        Goldman used to be special. Now, Goldman is merely a far smaller bank than J.P. Morgan. Sure, their results beat analyst expectations by nearly double in April. But their revenues only rose 13 percent. J.P. Morgan's top line gain? A cool 48 percent. More to the point, J.P. Morgan's investment bank brought in $1.4 billion in revenue in the quarter, tops on Wall Street.         Goldman had, for a time, the most badass leader on Wall Street in Hank Paulson. But Paulson is long gone.        Beyond generally seeming mealy-mouthed, the company's current CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, has of late been styling himself a little like Jamie Dimon, in particular in his late-to-the-game calls for compensation reform among the country's most overpaid paper-pushers.        But Dimon actually exudes real confidence instead of merely putting it on as a public-relations costume. Goldman's co-president, Jon Winkelreid, recently resigned in the wake of a bailout by his company because he was somehow&mdash;and this is really just extraordinary&mdash;insolvent. This despite being paid more than $100 million over the past decade.       Goldman Sachs is no longer the Goldman Sachs of the financial world. J.P. Morgan Chase is.    But most tellingly, it used to be that at the scene of every Wall Street hit-and-run, people would whisper that Goldman had been seen driving away from the wreckage. When talking of the fall of the giant hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Wall Streeters always talked about how Goldman pretended to want to save them only to end up trading against all of LTCM's positions.        But last fall, when Lehman Brothers failed and Merrill Lynch jumped into the arms of Bank of America, there was no talk of Goldman. Instead, everyone whispered about how J.P. Morgan and Jamie Dimon had been ruthless with both in terms of collateral calls, pushing both to the brink&mdash;actually, pushing Lehman over the brink&mdash;of insolvency. (J.P. Morgan, of course denies that it was the proximate cause of any of this.)        "The way he is conducting himself while all these companies are in distress is shocking," one Wall Streeter told me at the time. "And he can't hide behind layers of management. At a time like that, there's no way, if you're going to do something that severe, that it comes from somebody other than him."        That Wall Streeter, mind you, was a partner at Goldman Sachs.
