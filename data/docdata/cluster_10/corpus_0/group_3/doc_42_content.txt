 We have always said, if you really want to learn how a bond trades, put a few $ billion on the books and have at it!&amp;nbsp; This morning, analysts at Bank of America are stating that the $29 billion of fabulous bonds the Fed took in on the the Bear Stearns take over, are approximately $6 billion underwater.&amp;nbsp; In the portfolio, the Fed has about $7 billion of securities (some in CDO form I believe) where the underlying collateral is backed by Alt-A mortgages.&amp;nbsp; As we have said many times before, Alt-A is often worse than subprime as the underwriting on the loans basically consisted of having the borrower sign the loan documents and the bank cutting him his check!&amp;nbsp;   The next lesson the Fed is going to learn is the difference between "Fair Value" accounting and what we call "Mark-to-Model".&amp;nbsp; I am sure they have these assets on the books at a price of 80-00.&amp;nbsp; The market value is probably 60-00.&amp;nbsp; They can hold the assets at 85-00 until 75% of the loans default, and the losses on disposition of the collateral come out around 40%!&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Then they can learn what the term "impaired" means.
