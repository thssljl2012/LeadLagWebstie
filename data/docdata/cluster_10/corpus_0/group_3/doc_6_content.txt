Yesterday, 9/29, was a very bad day for the economy world wide.&amp;nbsp; US stocks fell almost 10% across the board, the single largest point fall (777 points) in the history of the Dow Jones.&amp;nbsp; $1.2 trillion (American) was lost yesterday when the market took a dive.&amp;nbsp; Oil plummeted.&amp;nbsp; Something you may not know - the United Arab Emerants no longer accept US dollars for oil, but rather the Euro.&amp;nbsp; As the $700 billion bail out was denied, European investors in US stock panicked and the Euro went way down.&amp;nbsp; The value of the Euro drove down the price of oil. Which at any other time would be a great thing, except for the reason as to why it happened this time. Today, the market rose about 50% of the amount it fell yesterday.&amp;nbsp; This has restored some slight hope, but it's what we call a 'dead cat bounce.'&amp;nbsp; Which means exactly what it implies.&amp;nbsp; A dead cat may bounce just once...&amp;nbsp; Tomorrow the market will fall again.&amp;nbsp; Or maybe the next day.&amp;nbsp; Sadly, it's all&amp;nbsp;coming down around us. Wachovia patrons will notice that ATM machines will accept deposits but will no longer give cash.&amp;nbsp; Lots of people are reporting their inability to withdraw funds from their accounts.&amp;nbsp; Monday morning, Wachovia was trading at around $0.72/share. That's bad.&amp;nbsp; It closed Friday at $10/share.&amp;nbsp; $10 was its 52 week low.&amp;nbsp; Citibank has plans to buy.&amp;nbsp; We'll see. Credit is all but halted.&amp;nbsp; Bank of America, the largest&amp;nbsp;bank in the country, may cancel all its' customers' credit cards in the morning.&amp;nbsp; May.&amp;nbsp; That's one thing i've heard. JP Morgan is doing very well.&amp;nbsp; But they recently bought out Chase-Manhattan, Bear Stearns, and Washington Mutual (the latter was purchased for $1.5 billion, a company with $300 billion plus in assets).&amp;nbsp; Buying all these banks are great for the customers of those banks, but only add to the bad faith debts of JP Morgan. Bank runs are gaining speed.&amp;nbsp; The market crashed in 1929 because of runs on the bank, people running to get their money out before it all collapsed.&amp;nbsp; America got a running start on banks early last week. Watch the market fall today.&amp;nbsp; Watch for a bank holiday which will happen for no good reason.&amp;nbsp; When that happens, go buy food. Lots of it. It's going to be a bumpy ride, folks. Hold on.
