In what is no doubt a testament to its stellar record of providing only the most state-of-the-art and dependable of online banking experiences (insert laugh track here), Bank of America stands to maintain its No. 1 position atop the Internet banking world despite the fact that several of its competitors are gobbling up acquisitions like so many breath mints. From a comScore press release: &amp;quot;Bank of America will likely continue to have the largest number of online customers compared to merged Chase/WaMu or proposed Wells Fargo/Wachovia or Citi/Wachovia across both liquid deposit account customers as well as online customers of any kind, even though the bank mergers will result in a large percentage of new additive customers.&amp;quot; What is this likely to mean for BoA customers? Business as usual, unfortunately.
