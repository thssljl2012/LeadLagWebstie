Hills Bank is really getting on my nerves with how unreliable their online banking is (and how it's only unreliable after hours, so you can't call for help).What is a good Iowa bank?  I wish there were WaMus here because I loved having WaMu before, but alas, no WaMu. :(  And I have a history of issues with Bank of America, so nix on them as well.
