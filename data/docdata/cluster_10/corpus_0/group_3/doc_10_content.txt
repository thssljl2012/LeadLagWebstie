http://www.amazon.com/Age-Turbulence-Adventures-New-World/dp/1594201315 I am going to start reading up this book starting next week once I am done with &amp;#8216;The Snowball - Warren Buffett and the business of life&amp;#8217;. While critics are holding Greenspan responsible for advocating ARM&amp;#8217;s way back in his testimony to Congress in 2004 and his keeping of interest rates low from the days of the dot com bubble burst, I still admire Greenspan for what he did for the US economy. Its easy to criticize the Federal reserve Chairman but what were the Wall Street companies and their hugely overpaid CEO&amp;#8217;s doing? Who will track Dick Fuld (CEO of the now disgraced/bankrupt Lehman Brothers that sold itself to Barclays some weeks back) or who will track the activities of Merrill Lynch&amp;#8217;s ex-CEO who was fired or who will track the activities of AIG&amp;#8217;s ex-CEO who insured a whole load of CDS that nearly sunk AIG. Will post my review once done but it will take some time to read up both books!
