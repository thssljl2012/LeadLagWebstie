Daily Real Estate News October 9, 2008  Rep. Frank to Banks: Modify Mortgages U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass, sent a letter to the country&amp;#8217;s largest banks urging them to take a lesson from Bank of America and work with troubled homeowners to restructure loans. Bank of America, which purchased Countrywide Financial Corp., announced plans this week to spend nearly $9 billion to give troubled borrowers substantial interest rate reductions, reductions in principal, and waivers of late fees or repayment penalties.  Frank urged Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co., and Wells Fargo &amp;amp; Co. to follow suit. &amp;#8220;It is essential that every mortgage servicer firmly commit to implement plans for immediate mass modifications based on, or stronger than, the measures Bank of America/Countrywide has undertaken,&amp;#8221; Frank said.
