Another white-knuckle week, with Congress as volatile as Wall Street.  The big bailout package finally passed but big questions still remain on details. Warren Buffett came to the rescue, pumping cash into Goldman Sachs and GE. Wachovia flip-flopped and is now hitching its wagon to Wells Fargo (and for lots more money) over Citigroup. The unemployment rate held steady at 6.1 pct for September, but the economy lost 159,000 jobs. And the Dow fell more than 800 points for the week to its lowest close since October 2005. With $700 billion to buy toxic securities, the US government will be one of the worlds largest asset managers.  It will be interesting to see how Wall Street will now price the derivatives, which seems to have always been a problem with the mortgage-related assets for some time. What the bailout does not address, however, is the ailing housing industry, the crux of the problem all along, and the monthly jobs report Friday certainly underscored the weakness in housing, autos and other backbone industries.Another Type of Jobs ReportAmid all the big headlines, the SEC said last week it is investigating the origin of a false report on a CNN citizen journalist Web site that Apple CEO Steve Jobs had a heart attack.  Apple stock dropped more than 5 percent on the posting, which Apple called not true.Ouch!As if the Wachovia news was not bad enough for Vikram Pandit, the Citigroup CEO, William Smith, a New York money manager with Citi shares, publicly called the Citi executives the Keystone cops, saying only Citigroup could let it slip away.  Over the weekend, Citi execs were reportedly meeting with attorneys over a possible lawsuit, alleging that Wachovia violated an exclusivity agreement. Thats bad news for Citi, indeed, but also for New York, with a West Coast bank picking up the assets (just like Charlotte-based Bank of America picked up Merrill assets).Lehman Filing Hits PR, Too The Lehman Brothers bankruptcy filing has not only hurt other financial institutions but also public-relations firm Kekst &amp;amp; Co., which is stuck with an unpaid bill of $400,000 for advising Lehmans CEO Dick Fuld.  Another ouch.
