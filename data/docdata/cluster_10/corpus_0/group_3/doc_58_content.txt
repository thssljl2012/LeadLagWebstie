     By Hal Eddins, Capital Investment Counsel, &amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; &amp;#0160;I wanted to put out a quick note to let you know our opinion about the current market conditions.&amp;#0160; What an October and were not even halfway through the month yet!&amp;#0160; At the market lows this past Friday, the Dow had peeled off 27.5% from its close on September 30th.&amp;#0160; Mondays nearly 1000 point rally helped but the Dow remains down 28% from where it started the year.  My stock market career began 21 years ago.&amp;#0160; The events of the past three weeks are the first that come close to that 22% one day crash on October 19, 1987.&amp;#0160; Those of you who have heard me speak over the last several years know that the price of option volatility (the VXO) is a recurring theme in our approach.&amp;#0160; To briefly recap, in normal markets, we would tend to be buyers of stocks as the VXO approached the upper 30s and sellers of stocks as the VXO approached the high teens.&amp;#0160; The theory behind this goes that as volatility rises, it shows a high price is being paid for the protection offered by option puts.&amp;#0160; When people are willing to spend irrational amounts of money to protect their portfolios, it generally means that we are close to the end of the selling pressure.  When stocks bottomed in 2002 before making their 2003 bull run, the VXO spiked to a level of 56.&amp;#0160; On September 11, 2001 as terrorists flew a plane into the &amp;quot;Twin&amp;#0160;Towers&amp;quot;,&amp;#0160;the VXO hit a high of 58.&amp;#0160; To show just how high our current level of fear is, as the Dow hit Fridays low of $7882, the VXO printed a level of 103!&amp;#0160; On the back of Mondays rally, fear finally began to recede and the VXO is currently at 60-more than double its normal levels.   One of the most important characteristics of stock investing is to be one step ahead of the markets. &amp;#0160;An investor wants to zig while others are zagging or vice versa.&amp;#0160; In other words, you want to be selling before the declines begin and buying before stocks begin their run up.&amp;#0160;   The upshot of all this means that our current environment is likely to prove to be an important opportunity to invest at multi year lows.&amp;#0160; The Dow is recently hit levels that it not only saw in 2002 but also 1998.&amp;#0160; Think of all the advances since 1998 that have occurred in the business world.&amp;#0160; Its almost as if investors are getting a do over.&amp;#0160; Another chance to buy companies that literally changed the world.&amp;#0160; One no longer has to play what if.&amp;#0160; As in what if I had bought Costco before they changed retailing?&amp;#0160;&amp;#0160; As in what if I had bought Nokia before they began dominating the world cell phone market?&amp;#0160; Unfortunately, your what if with Apple Computer is a little more limited.&amp;#0160; You cant buy Apple at the price before they came out with the I-POD, but you can buy Apple at the same levels as when they came out with the I-PHONE.   In addition to the names listed above, we are buying the best and brightest in American business.&amp;#0160; The names include United Parcel Service (UPS $54), General Electric ($22), Johnson and Johnson ($61), New York Times (NYT $14), Bank of America (BAC $22) and Wal Mart (WMT $50).  Now you may be thinking, this is all well and fine but what does it have to do with me?&amp;#0160; Many of you may focus on the insurance side of the business, but Id wager that many of your clients also own stock portfolios at other firms.&amp;#0160; Id also be willing to wager that they are down fairly significantly in the last few months.&amp;#0160; Its a great opener to find out how happy they are with their current asset manager.&amp;#0160; At Capital Investment Counsel, we would be happy to evaluate any of these accounts.&amp;#0160; There is no commitment on the clients part and no work on your part other than asking the question: how is your portfolio doing?&amp;#0160; If you have an account youd like for us to evaluate, you can email me directly or contact Kurt Dressler.&amp;#0160; Were happy to help in any way we can.&amp;#0160; Its a rough market for everyone, but the important thing is to continue and take advantage of what the market offers you.&amp;#0160; In closing Ill leave you with this quote from Rocky Balboa of the Rocky movies:  &amp;quot;The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows. It is a very mean and nasty place. It will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me or nobody is going to hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit, it is about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much can you take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done!&amp;quot;  &amp;#0160; Disclosures: Past performance is not indicative of future results.&amp;#0160; This material is not financial advice or an offer to sell any product. &amp;#0160;The actual characteristics with respect to any particular client account will vary based on a number of factors including but not limited to: (i) the size of the account; (ii) investment restrictions applicable to the account, if any; and (iii) market exigencies at the time of investment.
