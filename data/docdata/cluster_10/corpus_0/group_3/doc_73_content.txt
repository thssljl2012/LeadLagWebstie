New York  Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has been making headlines because he has strong-armed AIG into trying to recover outrageous bonuses and other perks while its financial condition was not so great.    Cuomos leverage (so to speak) arises from, among other things, laws forbidding fraudulent conveyances and similar transactions.  Fraudulent conveyance law is a complex, if vital, corner of debtor-creditor law.  It essentially says that a company cannot convey property for less than reasonably equivalent value if it is insolvent, undercapitalized, or the like.  If  you're in financial trouble, the saying goes, "you must be just before you are generous."  Among other things, this means that if a company like AIG was paying bonuses (or redeeming stock) while it was in fact in distress, those who received AIGs cashlike Joe Cassano, who was paid millions for running AIGs brilliant credit default swap shop--should have to pay it back unless they gave AIG "reasonably equivalent value."  Gifts are axiomatically not supported  by any (much less reasonably equivalent) value.  But if AIG is Cuomos only target, hes thinking WAY TOO SMALL.  Todays New York Times reports the following grim milestone:  All of the combined profits that major banks earned in recent years have vanished:  In the case of the nine-largest commercial banks  Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Washington Mutual and Wachovia  profits from early 2004 until the middle of 2007 were a combined $305 billion. But since July 2007, those banks have marked down their valuations on loans and other assets by just over that amount.
