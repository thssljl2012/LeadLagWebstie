Only in todays market can the Dow have one of its biggest gains ever, on a day when consumer confidence logged its worst readings since its been followed.  After the Dows nearly 900-point rally today, on what seemed like nothing but loads of bad news, youre right to stand back and wonder what in the world to make of this absurd volatility  and more importantly, how to invest around it.  The short, easy, and honest answer is that this volatility is spectacularly unreasonable, and youre foolhardy to try such an approach.  Think about it: Only a few weeks ago, the Dow soared an equally impressive amount  936 points  sending a wave of euphoria over markets, as if our troubles were behind us. Within days  poof! The gains were gone. Theres little reason to jump for joy over todays gain, either. Call me a party pooper, but the bad news in the economy hasnt disappeared, my friends.  In the banking sector alone, the likes of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup all gained well into double-digit percentages today. Thats spectacular if youre a leveraged hedge-fund manager trying to meet margin calls, but completely irrelevant if youre a long-term investor looking to own good companies for a long period of time.  During these tumultuous times, the most important thing to keep in mind is that the long term is your only hope for success, and the cacophony of short-term madness weve experienced has absolutely nothing to do with where well be three, five, or 10 years down the road.  Sit back. Marvel at the madness. Bottom-fish when things get ugly.  Thats about all you can ask for these days. - The Motley Fool
