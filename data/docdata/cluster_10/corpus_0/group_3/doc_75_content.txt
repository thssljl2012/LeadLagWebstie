The Financial Services Roundtable and the Consumer Federation of America asked the Department of the Treasury today for a piece of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act money, the bailout money, to help banks and card issuers reduce the credit card balances for borrowers who don&amp;#8217;t qualify for other government assistance like repayment plans.  So far, the Treasury spent $125 billion of the bailout money to buy stock in banks and bank holding companies: Citibank: $25 billion JP Morgan Chase: $25 billion Wells Fargo: $25 billion Bank of America and Merrill Lynch: $25 billion Goldman Sachs: $10 billion Morgan Stanley: $10 billion Bank of New York Mellon: $3 billion State Street: $2 billion  Should the government also provide money to credit card issuers to forgive debt for consumers who don&amp;#8217;t have the means to pay?  If so, the most likely recipients will be Discover and Capital One, as well as Citibank, Bank of America, and JP Morgan Chase, who have already received a portion of the bailout.
