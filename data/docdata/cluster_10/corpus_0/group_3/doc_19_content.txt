AIG said &amp;quot;We can do that for you&amp;quot; and they started selling Credit Default Swaps as fast as they could print them up so the banks and hedge funds could go play in the debt markets with no downside. Yeah right. &amp;quot;Here at Cloud Cukoo Land we believe...&amp;quot;. Sure the CDS's had provisions that if AIG was downgraded, the insurer would post collateral to guarantee their guarantee. AIG was the largest insurer. In 48 hours it will be unrecognizable.AIG is trading at $3.03 down 36% premarket.Reality bites.     Posted by climateer at 5:05 AM
