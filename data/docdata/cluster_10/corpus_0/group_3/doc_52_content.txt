It's plain that the current financial crisis is worsening in spite of--or perhaps because of--the Treasury rescue plan.The strains in financial markets are becoming more, rather than less, severe in spite of the nuclear option of a $700 billion package: Interbank spreads are widening and are at a level never seen before; credit spreads are widening to new peaks; short-term Treasury yields are going back to near-zero levels as there is flight to safety; credit default swap (CDS) spreads for financial institutions are rising to extreme levels as the ban on shorting of financial stock has moved the pressures on financial firms to the CDS market; and stock markets around the world have reacted very negatively to this rescue package.Financial institutions in the U.S. and in advanced economies are going bust. In the U.S., the latest victims were Washington Mutual (nyse: WM - news - people ) (the largest U.S. savings and loan) and Wachovia (nyse: WB - news - people ) (the sixth largest U.S. bank). In the U.K., after Northern Rock (other-otc: NHRKF.PK - news - people ) and the acquisition of HBOS by Lloyds TSB (nyse: LYG - news - people ), you now have the bust and rescue of Bradford &amp; Bingley; in Belgium you had Fortis (other-otc: FORSY.PK - news - people ) going bust and being rescued over the weekend; in Germany, Hypo Real Estate, a major financial institution near bust, has also needed rescue.So, this is not just a U.S. financial crisis. It is a global crisis hitting institutions in the U.K., the Euro-zone and other advanced economies (Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, Canada etc.).more...
