While the mega banks like Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and J. P. Morgan Chase (JPM) buy up their failing competitors like Countrywide, Merrill Lynch (MER), Washington Mutual  and Wachovia (WB), small independent bankers are trying to retain their small business customers.   Indeed, with the increase in FDIC protection for bank customers to $250,000 on savings and checking accounts as well as certificates of deposit, independent banks may win some small business clients away from the big, impersonal national chains. Its well known that the financial conglomerates like Citigroup (C) havent been particularly successful, to put it mildly.    Therefore, the recent and pending acquisitions by BAC, WFC and JPM may not only make them less attractive to investors but also to small businesses and wealthy individuals.    But, then, these companies didnt get where they are by serving only big organizations. And they may actually win a greater share of the small business market. Its hard to predict.
