 One of our readers pointed out to us this weekend that his supposedly low risk "Vanguard Short-Term Bond Fund" contained Credit Default Swaps (CDS).&amp;nbsp; This was news to him and to us because I happen to have some of that fund in my 401k.&amp;nbsp; Good chance you do too.&amp;nbsp; Guess who our mutual fund wrote default protection on? Give up? Ok, LEHMAN BROTHERS.&amp;nbsp; Oops.&amp;nbsp; Luckily the position is small but still, nowhere in the fund description or fund investment strategy did it mention taking exposure to corporate names synthetically,via CDS.&amp;nbsp; I think that's a bit deceptive especially since ,by writing CDS on Lehman to Bank of America (BAC was listed as the counterparty), you have some risk to BAC too.&amp;nbsp; It's not huge, but there is still the performance issue of BAC not paying you the agreed upon spread.&amp;nbsp; Also, after watching the food fight Friday that took place coming to a agreement on the payout protection writers had to make on Lehman protection, it certainly isn't the most transparent process.&amp;nbsp; It's not like a bond you can just sell.&amp;nbsp;   Anyway, we found the CDS way back in the fund's semi-annual report.&amp;nbsp; Other than being a line item it was not mentioned anywhere else.&amp;nbsp; There are other CDS, almost all non-financial names.&amp;nbsp; The point though is, in times like these, it's a bit of dirty pool not telling investors that the fund is using credit derivatives to take credit exposure.&amp;nbsp; If I were you, I would ask my friendly manager at Fidelity, PIMCO, etc., if they have CDS in their bond funds, if so how much and a list of names they have written protection on.
