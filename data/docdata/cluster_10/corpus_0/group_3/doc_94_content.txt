The company synonymous with the word investment bank -- Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. -- is now a bank holding company and has applied for a New York state banking charter, New York Gov. David A. Patterson said Monday, The New York Times reports. The move suggests Goldman is not interested in national consumer-focused business but rather managing assets for high-net-worth individuals, according to the Times. The strategy would differentiate Goldman from its commercial bank competitors: Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp. The four operate under a national banking charter, which allow them to open branches across states without separate applications. - Gerald Magpily   See New York Times article
