Are credit cards the next collapse?First came trouble with mortgages, then home equity loans and commercial real estate. Now, banks are starting to worry about credit cards.As the economy slows and unemployment rises, consumers are defaulting on credit-card payments more often. And though that trend is unlikely to create a crisis in line with the mortgage fallout, it's still a headache for banks that are already hurting.U.S. banks charged off 5.47 percent of all credit card loans in the second quarter, according to the Federal Reserve, representing some $50 billion that they'll likely never collect. That's up from 3.85 percent the year before, and that is a movement that's on the radar of Ken Lewis, chief executive of Charlotte's Bank of America Corp.Asked in a recent TV interview if credit-card debt would be the next shoe to drop for the banking industry, Lewis replied: It, in some ways, already is, adding that such losses have risen pretty substantially.Laura Nishikawa, an analyst at the Innovest ratings agency, predicts that banks such as Bank of America and New York's Citigroup Inc. could be hit especially hard by credit-card defaults. That's because those banks, which offer both consumer and investment services, have been depending more heavily on money made on consumer services such as credit cards as the returns in investment banking grow increasingly unpredictable.To be sure, credit cards don't represent a huge portion of assets for most banks. For example, they comprise about 14 percent of all consumer loans and leases at Bank of America, the country's largest credit-card issuer. The main problem, Nishikawa said, is that everyone is so weak after what happened with mortgages that another blow to a consumer product would be hard to handle.Consumer groups have long complained that credit-card issuers push cards onto people who don't need them or can't afford them. They say that rising credit-card defaults  just like mortgage defaults  are largely the fault of banks who lent to risky borrowers.Innovest estimates that about 30 percent of Bank of America's credit card loans are to subprime borrowers  second only to the failed Washington Mutual Inc., which had almost half of its credit-card loans held by subprime borrowers.Innovest also estimates that more than half of Bank of America's credit cards are high-limit cards  second only to American Express Co. (Innovest classifies high-limit cards as those with lines of more than $10,000.) Nishikawa says that combination could prove toxic for Bank of America, which may have lent more than (borrowers) can be expected to pay back.Bank of America's charge-offs, or loans it doesn't expect to collect on, increased to 6.14 percent of all credit-card loans, or $1.24 billion, in the third quarter. That's up from 4.61 percent the year before.source: charlotteobserver.com
