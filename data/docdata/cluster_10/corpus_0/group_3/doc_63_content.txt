 Stocks slid Wednesday morning upon disappointing economic news amid another Senate vote on a revised government financial bailout package. Automatic Data Processing showed a decline of 8,000 private sector jobs in September. The Institute for Supply Management reported manufacturing activity is at its lowest level since October 2001. Regional banks such as National City Corp. recovered slightly Tuesday. Moody's placed National City on review for possible downgrade, citing significant exposure to real estate-related credit costs earlier this week. In other financial news, a wave of investors are expected to demand their investments back from hedge fund managers after disappointing returns. Meanwhile, Google Inc.'s shares were reset at $400.52 after Nasdaq said the share drop to $341.43 was due to "erroneous orders." - Maria Woehr                Troubled Wall Street        Prices at 10:00 am EDT                 Name       Price at          open       Price          at 10:00am       Change       Mkt cap                 J.P.
