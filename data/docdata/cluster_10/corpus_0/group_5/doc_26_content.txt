     From the Trib's own alert news service we get,Media conglomerate Tribune Co. has filed for bankruptcy protection, pressured by high debts.  The Chicago Tribune's parent company was working with bankruptcy advisers at investment bank Lazard and law firm Sidley Austin to weigh financial options, sources told the Chicago Tribune for this morning's paper.   Tribune Co. has been struggling under a $13 billion debt load since real estate magnate Sam Zell took the company private last December in an $8.2 billion leveraged buyout. The company faces a deadline today on $70 million of unsecured debt it took on before Zell's deal.Let them sink.&amp;nbsp; They sealed their fate by prying open the Ryan family's child custody case in 2004.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The only way they could survive now would be to make columnist John Kass the man-in-charge and assign every reporter and columnist to follow Kass' courageous lead and turn this city's slimy and corrupt boulders over, shine the light on the scattering political cockroaches beneath.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  The only thing is along the way, the Trib bought a friend who's moving into the White House.&amp;nbsp; Watch for none other than Barack Obama to find a government way to rescue his promoters, perhaps as America's first federally-funded and owned national newspaper -- reorganized as the &amp;quot;United States of Obama's Pravda,&amp;quot;
