 From Clusterstock.com Thain Asked for $40 million! This is&amp;nbsp;perfect for the "You want to know why we are where we are?" category!&amp;nbsp; I have to hand it to Thain.&amp;nbsp; In&amp;nbsp;August we, along with just about everyone&amp;nbsp;else in the blogosphere, were pounding Thain for releasing earnings, saying he was comfortable where his CDOs were marked and that capital levels were fine....and then nine days later taking a $5.7&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;loss on the sale of a chunk of&amp;nbsp;those CDOs and announcing a new capital raise!&amp;nbsp; Suddenly a month later, he&amp;nbsp;GETS MERGED with Bank of&amp;nbsp;America (a&amp;nbsp;firm that&amp;nbsp;had&amp;nbsp;cut Merrill's trading lines a few days prior) the same weekend that Lehman went under and Thain becomes a&amp;nbsp;hero!&amp;nbsp; The only thing Thain did was not be as big of an A-Hole as Dick Fuld!&amp;nbsp; Bank of&amp;nbsp;America had to take somebody and Merrill was the better company and Thain was less of a headache! $40 million!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You know what.&amp;nbsp; It is exactly one year ago that Richie and I made this!
