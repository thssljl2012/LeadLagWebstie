Bank of America Corp. CEO Ken Lewis received the title Banker of the Year -- the second time American Banker bestowed the honor on him -- despite his bank's flagging shares and the overall industry's distress. As a matter of fact, just issuing awards to bankers amid the worst credit crisis and banking panic since the Great Depression seems odd. Then again, we're talking about banking, an industry in which executives thought it was perfectly fine to take bonuses even as they were taking government welfare. On the bright side, American Banker had the good sense to ask FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair to roast Lewis (and the rest of the industry) at Thursday night's honorarium. - Matthew Wurtzel See a summation of Lewis' comments at ceremony from Reuters   See a summation of Bair's speech from FT Alphaville
