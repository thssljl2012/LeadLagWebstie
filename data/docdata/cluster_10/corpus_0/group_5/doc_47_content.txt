         Well, this bailout surely convinced people that GM won't eventually go bankrupt.  A 59 percent interest rate means that people loaning GM money want to get their principle back quickly.  Compare this to the interest rates at Bank of America (1.9%), Morgan Stanley (1.5%), JPMorgan Chase (1.6%), or AT&amp;T (6.1%).Labels: bailout
