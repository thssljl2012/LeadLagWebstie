       The big news today at Merrill Lynch was the announcement that 30,000 to 35,000 heads will be cut as a result of the merger with Bank of America. In absolute terms, this number pales in comparison only to the figure announced by Citi some weeks back. This email "greeting" came as a shock only to the uninformed few as news of the same have been spreading in CNBC and other channels for quite some time now. In this instance, it is actually the media who breaks this news before the company itself. I find this rather disturbing, not simply because of the possibility of losing employment but that the news was communicated to the employees weeks after it leaked to the public. Heads have reportedly been cut as early as this week in Equity Research, though the final number for the layoffs will be finalized early next-year. By early next year, I hope they mean March. It probably won't take long before this tempest rolls into our meager division.   I am praying for more time.
