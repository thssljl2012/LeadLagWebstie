On Monday (December 8th) the Wall Street Journal reported that Merrill Lynch CEO, Jeff Thain requested a $10M bonus. I was speechless! Mr. Thain believes he deserved this bonus for &amp;#8220;holding-the-loss-line&amp;#8221; at Merrill to a staggering $11.67 BILLION melt down and then astutely arranging the pennies-on-the-dollar sale to Bank of America. Sheez, I could have done that with one eye closed and neverdo balance my check book! Jeff Thain Being ever so &amp;#8220;wise&amp;#8221; and picking up on the backlash &amp;#8220;buzz&amp;#8221; he announced the very next day a sudden humbleness-change-of-mind (do you think the public anger and condemnation helped?) and retracted the request for this $10M taxpayer subsidized bonus! Has Mr. Thain ever once put his (mis)management and chicanery into human terms? We don&amp;#8217;t need to be an economist to understand the games. It&amp;#8217;s getting harder and harder to underestimate the executive management intelligence in the financial/banking sector. Photo courtesy AP.  All Rights Reserved  Northwest Harley Blog
