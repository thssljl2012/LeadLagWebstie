Interesting that Gov. Rick Perry is so dead-set against government bailouts, as we reported today, but he gave out millions in Texas taxpayer dollars to corporate predatory lenders who helped cause the economic crisis in the first place. Perry has doled out millions from his state Enterprise Fund to businesses that say they'll produce jobs in the state.  Perry awarded $20 million to Countywide Financial. The company subsequently ran into legal trouble because of its predatory loans and, as the economy turned south, was subsequently bought up by Bank of America (which happens to be one of the big federal bailout recipients).  Then there was Washington Mutual. In 2005, Perry gave a $15 million handout of taxpayer money to the nation's largest savings and loan. Again, the promise was jobs. Instead, WaMu foundered and federal regulators had to step in (and ultimately get swallowed up by JPMorgan Chase) - but only after the ailing lender's political fund made campaign contributions to Perry.   Rick Perry with WaMu executive at 2005 news conference, touting the $15 million in taxpayer dollars given to the lender to create jobs. So far, not so many.  As for the promised jobs, A Perry spokesman said the governor still hopes they'll come. And if they don't? The spokesman says they'll just have to pay back the money -- presumably with federal bailout dollars.
