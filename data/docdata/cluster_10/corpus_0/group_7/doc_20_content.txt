Margaret Carlson on Bloomberg dot com asks a question (emphasis added): I learned that 696 individuals at Merrill Lynch &#038; Co. got bonuses last summer. You remember Merrill Lynch, the once-proud institution that on the eve of its implosion was bought by Bank of America Corp., a company that later got billions of dollars in government bailout money.  I would very much like to locate Employee 697. If 696 people who helped destroy the company still got at least $1 million each for their effort, imagine what No. 697 must have done NOT to get it.
