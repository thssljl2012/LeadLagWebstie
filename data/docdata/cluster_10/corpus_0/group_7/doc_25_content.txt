If financial markets continue under severe stress over the next two years, CreditSights, a research company, estimates the nation&#8217;s six largest banks could see losses totaling $524 billion, reports the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s DealBook. Here&#8217;s more: The future losses for some banks are staggering by CreditSights estimates: Wells Fargo, $119 billion; BofA, $99 billion; JPMorgan, $124 billion; Citi, $101 billion; Goldman Sachs: $47 billion; Morgan Stanley, $34 billion. Economist Paul Krugman, commenting on CreditSights&#8217; numbers for the New York Times, says Citi, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan would need a combined capital injection of $450 billion to offset projected losses of equal value. Meanwhile, their combined market cap (the value implied by their stock price and shares outstanding) last week totaled around $200 billion. With numbers like that Krugman says it is hard to rescue big banks without giving a handout to current shareholders. He thinks government should seize any banks shown to be insolvent by the Treasury Secretary&#8217;s new stress test; wipe out current shareholders; clean up banks&#8217; balance sheets; and sell the cleansed bank to new investors.
