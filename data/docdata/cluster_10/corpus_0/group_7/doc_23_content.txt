News Friday that the $787 billion stimulus package passed in the House of Representatives was not enough to stimulate the dismal stock market as the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued its fall, sliding 82.35 points to close at 7,580.14. One deal stock that is in desperate need of some kind of positive stimulation is American International Group Inc. The ailing insurer announced Friday that its AIG Financial Products Inc. subsidiary sold two groups of financing contracts for oil and gas well companies for $60.5 million. The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that the company has also put its Japanese headquarters building on the block, which is said to be able to nab over $1 billion. Shareholders did not seem too impressed at these relatively small sales considering the $60 billion government loan that hangs over AIG's head. AIG's shares Friday continued to dip below the $1 mark, closing down 5.56% at 85 cents per share.   The beaten-down banks, which have received so much from the government, now will have something taken away. Buried in the stimulus bill is a provision that eliminates new tax breaks available to merging banks. Bank of America Corp. and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. took the news particularly hard, closing down 5.11% to $5.57 per share and down 5.73% to $24.69 per share, respectively.   The struggling automakers, which have also taketh from the government, are being asked to giveth ... a plan on how they will be profitable. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank sent letters Friday to the heads of Chrysler LLC and General Motors Corp., urging them to describe specifically how they will position their companies to become competitive and profitable. GM shares buckled under the pressure, slipping 5.66% to $2.50. - Michael Rudnick
