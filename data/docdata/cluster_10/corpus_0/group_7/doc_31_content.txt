As Big Brother government continues to inject more and more into the ailing banks, the fear of nationalization is griping Wall Street. Meanwhile, Sen. Lindsey Graham,R-S.C., did not do much to ease investor fears of a government banking takeover as he said on Wednesday that nationalization is an option to address the banks that fail to meet U.S. Treasury's planned stress tests. Fear of nationalization was coupled with analyst expectations that credit card defaults may exceed 10% in 2009, which could take a particularly hard toll on the bottom lines of Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. The one-two punch sent BofA shares down 14% to close at $3.93 per share. Citigroup, which is the most likely candidate for nationalization, plummeted 13.75% to close at $2.51 per share. Even J.P. Morgan, which isn't a likely nationalization candidate, wasn't immune to the chatter as shares dropped 4.23% to $20.60.Not all was lost in the banking sector. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. climbed 1.79% to close at $86.01 following a report from BofA analyst Guy Mozkowski that the company is back in the black after raising fees it charged to customers for trades.   The financials dragged down the broader market as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 89.68 points, its lowest level in six years. - Michael Rudnick                  Troubled Wall Street        Prices at approximately 4:00 pm ET                  Name       Price at          open       Price          at 4:00 pm       Change       Mkt cap                 J.P.
