 This NBER Working Paper by Takeo Hoshi and Anil K Kashyap was revised December 2008. In short it concludes that the US political process seems to be reproducing many of the Japan mistakes. Abstract:  The U.S. government is using a variety of tools to try to rehabilitate the U.S. banking industry. The two principal policy levers discussed so far are employing asset managers to buy toxic real estate securities and making bank equity purchases. Japan used both of these strategies to combat its banking problems. There are also a surprising number of other similarities between the current U.S. crisis and the recent Japanese crisis, The Japanese policies were only partially successful in recapitalizing the banks.  We explain why that was the case and then compare the current U.S. plans with those pursued in Japan. While the U.S. plans are still in flux, it appears that U.S. is at risk for running into some of the same problems that hobbled the Japanese policies.  Megan McArdle and Matthew Yglesias have more discussion on this.
