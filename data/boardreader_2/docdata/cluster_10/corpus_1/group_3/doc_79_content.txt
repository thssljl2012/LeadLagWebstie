SOUTHFIELD, Michigan: General Motors Corp, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler may be forced into bankruptcy by slowing economies and dwindling US auto sales, Standard &amp;amp; Poors analyst Robert Schulz said yesterday.Macro factors could overwhelm them at some point even with the three biggest US automakers committed to turnarounds, Schulz said in a Bloomberg Television interview. S&amp;amp;P said on Thursday it may cut GM and Ford debt deeper into junk on forecasts for 2009 auto demand falling to the lowest since 1992.GM, Ford and Chrysler are under pressure as the worsening global credit crisis makes it harder for buyers to get loans and dealers to finance their operations. US industrywide sales tumbled 27% in September, the most in 17 years.With all three companies working to boost cash, any bankruptcy filing would be a last resort, not a strategic decision, said Schulz, who is based in New York.We dont see that as something they would choose, he said. Schulz said the trigger for a forced restructuring under bankruptcy protection would be based on the automakers ability to preserve liquidity as sales decline.Operating-cash needs at GM, Ford and Chrysler are substantial, so if it looked like they were going to be pushing toward that number because of these operating losses and cash usage, thats sort of the point where theyd have to consider bankruptcy, Schulz said.S&amp;amp;P said on Thursday that its debt ratings for GM and Ford, already at six steps below investment grade at B-, may be lowered again because the automakers face a serious challenge in 2009.GM shares will fall further, Barclays Capital analyst Brian Johnson said in a report yesterday, reducing his stock price for the Detroit-based automaker to $4.
