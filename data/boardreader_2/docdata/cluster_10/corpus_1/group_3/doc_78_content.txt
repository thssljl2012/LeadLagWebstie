The real estate services firm, CB Richard Ellis made its case at a breakfast held in the companys Park Avenue offices yesterday that Manhattans office market wont tank despite a crisis of historic proportions in the financial sector.A string of collapses, government bailout, emergency takeovers and reorganizations over the past two months has remade Wall Street and caused fears that the credit crunch, which has persisted for over a year, could worsen, cutting off capital to businesses of all types and thrusting the economy into a deep recession.The problems are particularly distressing for Manhattan, not only because the city is a center of business whose fortunes rise and fall on the health of the economy but also because financial firms are its biggest space using tenant. Real estate experts feared that large tracts of office space could be dumped on the market by recent events like the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the emergency takeovers of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch and the government's bailout of AIG, which reports indicate could now be dismantled.Worse yet, if the crisis escalates further, more firms could plunge into insolvency, casting off space in mass and further putting strain on rental and occupancy rates.But Simon Wasserberger a senior vice president at CBRE said that the citys real estate market had seen such low vacancy rates in recent times that even large layoffs wouldnt bring rents crashing down.Wasserberger said that if the city lost 150,000 jobs, more than what he said most experts predict will be let go, the average vacancy rate in Manhattan would rise to 12.5%. Thats more than double its current rate of 6.1% according to CBRE data, but far from the deterioration that past recessions have caused in the city Wasserberger said, which brought vacancy levels into the high teens and beyond 20% in some areas of Manhattan.A more likely scenario is that the city will lose about 100,000 jobs Wasserberger said, layoffs that will result in more modest amounts of sublease space and other availabilities. Vacancy would climb to just below 10% and cause a commensurate - but far from dramatic - weakening in average rental rates.So far, there have been encouraging signs that the tumult wouldnt cast off as much space as feared. Stephen Siegel, a CBRE executive who is one of the firms leading brokers, said that Lehmans acquisition by Barclays and the purchase of the Lehman unit Neuberger Berman by a private equity partnership would preserve most of Lehmans operations and prevent its offices from being dumped on the market.The sale of Neuberger Berman unit not only took that space off the market, theyre negotiating for two additional floors in that building, Siegel said. Theyre not subletting, theyre growing.Neuberger Berman is located in 605 Third Avenue. Barclays purchased Lehmans headquarters, 745 Seventh Avenue, as part of its deal to absorb the company and has said that it will continue to occupy that building in full. Only space that Lehman had at 399 Park Avenue is expected to come available, a fraction of the companys Manhattan footprint.But even Siegel, who termed himself a cautious optimist, admitted that there were still unanswered questions.We suspect there will be less leasing velocity, Siegel said. We dont know what will happen with Merrill, how much of that space is taken away because they dont use the units, how much of that comes to midtown because Bank of America wants them near where they are?Bank of America purchased Merrill Lynch for $50 billion in September as Merrill was negotiating to extend its lease at the World Financial Center. Real estate experts have murmured how much of Merrills operations the bank will shed even though the merger was thought to produce little redundancy.Bank of America also has the option to bring some of Merrills operations into a space in midtown it is vacating, 114 West 47th Street, a building near the banks new headquarters at One Bryant Park. Such a move would create vacancy downtown, which could be gaining space due to AIGs troubles, a firm that has over a million square feet in Lower Manhattan.Still, Siegel rattled off a number of leasing deals that are happening in the city and said that things werent as bad as they seemed.A single industry has been shattered here and changed for all time, financial services, Siegel said. But we are in a city that in the last ten to fifteen years at minimum has become extremely diverse from a business perspective.Frankly theres still a lot going on so I tend to be a cautious optimist. This is a wonderful city that has tremendous resiliency.
