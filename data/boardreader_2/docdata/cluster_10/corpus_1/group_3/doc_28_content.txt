SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Citigroup Inc. has become the latest large bank to back away from the crumbling mortgage industry, slashing the number of outside mortgage brokers it does business with and cutting 500 related jobs. Citigroup Inc. (C:CNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) , which is locked into a pitched battle with Wells Fargo &amp;amp; Co. (WFC:WFCNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) over Wachovia Corp. (WB:WBNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) , is cutting back on its wholesale mortgage business as part of a restructuring plan announced Tuesday. A Citigroup spokesman stressed that the firm is not abandoning the wholesale mortgage business, but is 'redefining' it. Citigroup will cut the number of outside mortgage brokers it does business with around the U.S. to 1,000 from about 9,500. The plan also involves laying off roughly 500 sales and operations employees. Citigroup will consolidate its 'retail volume' business in St. Louis, Dallas, and Southfield, Mich., the spokesman said. Citigroup shares rose more than 1% to $15.31 in late trading. A number of banks have abandoned the wholesale mortgage business, as the industry has collapsed as borrowers defaulted and related financial instruments crumbled, setting off a domino-like effect throughout the financial-services industry. While signs of the growing problem became evident years ago, the full effect has only recently become evident, as some of the U.S.'s largest financial, insurance and mortgage institutions crumbled. The federal government seized mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNM:FNMNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) and Freddie Mac (FRE:FRENews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) last month, and then took over tottering insurance giant American International Group Inc. (AIG:AIGNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) Last week, Congress enacted a $700 billion rescue package aimed at reviving the damaged financial markets.  Citigroup has proven to be among the more resilient financial institutions, as the credit crisis has claimed a number of its contemporaries in recent weeks, including storied Wall Street brokerages Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ:LEHMQNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) and Merrill Lynch (MER:MERNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) , and banks including Washington Mutual and Wachovia. Citigroup is vying with Wells Fargo to acquire Wachovia, which boasts a significant retail presence. According to a published report, Citigroup is pondering a deal that would have it taking Wachovia's branches in the Northeast, with those in the southeast going to Wells Fargo, though negotiations are continuing.  Earlier this week, Citigroup and Wells Fargo agreed to a suspension of litigation related to their battle over Wachovia. After Wachovia and Wells Fargo last week announced a $15 billion merger agreement, Citigroup sued to block the deal, arguing that it had exclusive rights to negotiate with Wachovia.
