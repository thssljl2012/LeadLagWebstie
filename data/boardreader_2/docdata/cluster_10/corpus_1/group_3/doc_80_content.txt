General Motors, Ford and Chrysler may be forced into bankruptcy by slowing economies and dwindling US car sales, a Standard &amp;amp; Poor's analyst says.'Macro factors could overwhelm them at some point'' even as the three biggest US carmakers vow to stick with their turnaround plans, Robert Schulz, S&amp;amp;P's lead car industry credit analyst, said. The companies said they had no plans for a bankruptcy filing.His assessment underscored the pressure on GM, Ford and Chrysler as the worsening global credit crisis makes it harder for buyers to get loans and dealers to finance their operations. S&amp;amp;P said yesterday it may further trim credit ratings for GM and Ford on forecasts for 2009 auto demand falling to the lowest since 1992.With all three companies working to increase cash, any bankruptcy filing would be a last resort, not a 'strategic'' decision, Mr Schulz said.'We don't see that as something they would choose,'' he said.Mr Schulz said the ttrigger for a forced restructuring under bankruptcy protection would be based on the carmakers' ability to preserve liquidity as sales decline.Industrywide US sales slid 27% last month, the most in 17 years.Not an option'Bankruptcy is not an option GM is considering,'' spokeswoman Renee Rashid-Merem said, reiterating comments made on Thursday. 'It's not in the interests of our employees, stockholders, suppliers or customers.''GM rose 24 cents, or 5%, to $US5 at 3.42pm in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, while Ford dropped 6 cents, or 2.9%, to $US2.02. GM slumped to a 58-year low yesterday and Ford closed at its lowest since 1982. Chrysler is closely held.Operating-cash needs at GM, Ford and Chrysler are 'substantial, so if it looked like they were going to be pushing towards that number because of these operating losses and cash usage, that's sort of the point where they'd have to consider'' bankruptcy, Mr Schulz said.S&amp;amp;P said yesterday that its debt ratings for GM and Ford, already at six steps below investment grade at B-, may be lowered again because the carmakers face a serious challenge in 2009.Barclays Capital reduced its target stock price for GM to $US4 today, with analyst Brian Johnson in Chicago citing dwindling global car demand.GM's cash needs'With car sales stalled in the US and beginning to contract in the rest of the world, we believe GM's cash needs are increasing,'' Mr Johnson wrote in a note.
