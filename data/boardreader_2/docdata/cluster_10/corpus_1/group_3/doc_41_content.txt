Lehmans: Further job cuts Photo: GETTY PricewaterhouseCoopers said the staff were told yesterday. Tony Lomas, one of the PwC partners who is leading the administration, said: 'It is extremely disappointing that despite exhausting all avenues these jobs could not be saved.' PwC last week struck a deal to sell Lehmans' equities and investment banking business in London to Nomura for an undisclosed price. Nomura took on 2,500 employees, mainly in London, and bought Lehman's Asia operation. The Japanese bank also held discussions with PwC about buying the fixed-income business, but the talks fell through. PwC has now decided it will not be able to find a buyer for this part of the business.There were 4,500 employees in the four London-based Lehmans businesses which PwC became administrator to when the bank collapsed. It is now left with 1,200. PwC has said some staff are needed until about Christmas to help the liquidate the business to maximise returns for creditors. But more job cuts are expected before that point.Lehmans collapsed just over two weeks ago. Barclays has bought Lehmans' US operation, taking on 10,000 employees. The UK bank is expected to make substantial cuts in that number over time.PwC is fighting for the return of $8bn which was in swept from Lehmans in Europe to its New York central operation in the days running up to the collapse. Mr Lomas added: 'We continue to be focused on maximising the value of recoveries for creditors, whilst minimising the impact on other stakeholders as much as possible.'
