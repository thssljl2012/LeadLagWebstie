  Barclays Capital is combining its family of indexes with those of Lehman Brothers under the Barclays Capital Indexes name, said Waqas Samad, head of Barclays Capital's index products group. "We have been working flat out to integrate these two very complementary index families. We've been in close touch with our clients and partners," Mr. Samad said. "I think they are seeing that we have brought together the best of both worlds in the new, combined Barclays Capital Indexes." In all the Lehman indexes, including the benchmark Lehman Aggregate Bond index, the name Lehman is being replaced by Barclays Capital.  Besides its own indexes, Barclays Capital is continuing to calculate and publish the indexes developed by Lehman Brothers Holdings, which Barclays acquired last month following the investment bank's Sept. 15 filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
