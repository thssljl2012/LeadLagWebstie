Lehman vet introduced Diamond to employees at bankrupt company's New York headquarters.  Barclays Capital announced that Herbert 'Bart' McDade III is departing after assisting with the integration of Lehman Brothers assets.  In September, Barclays agreed to buy bankrupt Lehman's North American investment banking, principal investing, trading and research, private investment management, and fixed income and equity sales businesses. The firm offered jobs to 10,000 Lehman employees.  When the chief executive of Barclays Capital, Bob Diamond, informed Lehman professionals in New York of his firm's offer to purchase the assets, he was introduced by McDade (see related story).  Bart McDade McDade took over as president and chief operating officer of Lehman in June, replacing Joseph Gregory. He had been Lehman's head of equities since 2005.  'Bart has been a tremendous partner in the creation of the enlarged Barclays Capital in recent weeks,' Diamond said in a statement. 'I am very grateful for his critical help and support and wish him the very best for the future.'  A Barclays Capital spokesman said McDade is not granting interviews about his departure.
