Merrill Lynch is working with the authorities to investigate the activities of a possible rogue currency trader in London.  In a statement, the bank, which was saved from collapse last year when it was bought by Bank of America, said it had discovered an irregularity during checks on some of its currency positions in the City.  It said senior managers in the business were 'focused on the issue' and that further risks were under control.  The comment from the bank followed a report in the New York Times naming the trader as Alexis Stenfors, 38, who is still an employee at Merrill Lynch. Stenfors told the New York Times that the issue was a 'misunderstanding' and his lawyer, Ian Ryan, said he was co-operating with the investigation. The report suggested he recorded a trading profit of about $120m.  Merrill lost $13.8bn in the final three months of last year alone. It was forced into the arms of Bank of America in a hastily cobbled together deal over a weekend in September when it became clear the bank was likely to share the fate of the now-defunct Lehman Brothers.  Bank of America bosses are demanding to know why many losses at Merrill did not appear on the books at the time of the deal.  larger   smaller  Email  Recipient's email address  Your first name  Your surname  Add a note (optional)  Your IP address will be logged  Share  Contact us  Contact the Business editor  Report errors or inaccuracies: userhelp@guardian.co.uk  Letters for publication should be sent to: letters@guardian.co.uk  If you need help using the site: userhelp@guardian.co.uk  Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard:  +44 (0)20 7278 2332  Merrill Lynch    Banking    Email  Recipient's email address  Your first name  Your surname  Add a note (optional)  Your IP address will be logged  Share  Contact us  Contact the Business editor  Report errors or inaccuracies: userhelp@guardian.co.uk  Letters for publication should be sent to: letters@guardian.co.uk  If you need help using the site: userhelp@guardian.co.uk  Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard:  +44 (0)20 7278 2332  About this article This article was first published on guardian.co.uk at 14.48 GMT on Friday 6 March 2009.
