Bank of America Corp. chief executive Ken Lewis received no bonus, restricted stock or stock options in 2008, according to a securities filing today.  Lewis earned a salary of $1.5 million and other compensation of $275,125, according to the company's annual proxy. The bank had previously said that neither Lewis nor his direct reports would receive a bonus for 2008, a year that saw the bank turn a profit but also seek billions in government aid.   Under Securities and Exchange guidelines, Lewis made $6 million in 2008, counting salary, restricted stock and other compensation. That's because the SEC requires companies to tally the amount of restricted stock expensed in 2008, which for Lewis came to about $4.3 million for stock granted between 2005 and 2007.  In comparison, Lewis had total compensation of about $17 million in 2007, under SEC guidelines. The Observer doesn't count stock option grants towards total compensation because the value is realized in the future. Lewis did not exercise any stock options in 2008. .
