(AP File Photo/Lawrence Jackson)   More Information  Bank of America Corp. will suffer grave and irreparable harm if Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. employees paid $3.6 billion in bonuses just before the firm's acquisition by the bank are publicly identified, its lawyers said.  Bank of America on Thursday filed documents in state court in Manhattan to intervene in a case brought by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to compel former Merrill Chief Executive Officer John Thain to testify about the bonus recipients.Neither the individual names nor the job titles bear any reasonable or relevant relationship to Cuomo's investigation, the firms argued in the documents. Nor is there a reasonable or relevant reason to disclose such information to the general public.The information Cuomo seeks would provide a road map revealing which business lines the banks believe to be most valuable and enable competitors to poach the bank's top talent, Bank of America argued in the court filing.  Disclosure of the information would also cause internal dissension and consternation, pose security risks for the exposed bankers and their families, and cause employees to leave, according to the filings.  On Wednesday, Cuomo subpoenaed seven people who received bonuses at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said a person familiar with the matter.  Thain and Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis previously testified in Cuomo's office about the bonuses awarded before the Jan. 1 merger.Bloomberg  An investment group affiliated with a coalition of unions on Thursday called for Bank of America Corp.'s board to remove chairman and chief executive Ken Lewis, citing disastrous missteps as leader of the nation's biggest bank.  In a letter to lead director Temple Sloan, the CtW Investment Group noted the 90 percent decline in the Charlotte bank's stock since Lewis agreed to buy Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in mid-September and the ongoing controversy over the payment of $3.6 billion in bonuses to Merrill employees before the deal closed Jan. 1. Removing Mr. Lewis is now a necessary prerequisite to restoring (Bank of America's) credibility with shareholders, regulators and the public, William Patterson, CtW's executive director, wrote in the letter. If Lewis is not ousted, the group will call on shareholders to vote against the re-election of Lewis, Sloan and corporate governance committee chairman Thomas Ryan at the April 29 shareholders' meeting.   The letter adds to the shareholder ire aimed at Lewis, CEO since 2001. Nearly two dozen shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the bank over the Merrill deal.   In January, Sloan issued a statement supporting Lewis. Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri declined comment.   Lewis has said that he considered backing out of the acquisition in December as Merrill's fourth-quarter losses mounted. But he proceeded under the urging of government officials. In a Financial Times interview this week, Lewis called it a tactical mistake to accept $20 billion in government aid to help stabilize the acquisition. He has said the bank doesn't need any more capital to weather losses.   CtW works with pension funds affiliated with Change to Win, a coalition of unions with 6 million members. The Service Employees International Union, a vocal critic of the bank, is among the participants. The unions hold 33 million Bank of America shares, less than 1 percent of the bank's shares outstanding.  Last year, CtW expressed concern about risk management practices at Bank of America and other big banks. CtW said it met with Sloan last spring and he assured the group that the board was diligent in its management oversight. Rallying shareholders to oust directors is a difficult task in corporate America.  Separately, Bank of America director Meredith Spangler will not stand for re-election in April because she will reach the mandatory retirement age of 72. Spangler of Charlotte, on the board since 1988, is the longest-serving director. She and her husband, Dick, are the largest individual shareholders in the bank with 32 million shares.   Bank of America shares closed down Thursday more than 11 percent to $3.17. .
