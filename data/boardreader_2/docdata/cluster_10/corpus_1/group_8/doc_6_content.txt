Bank of America Corp. today said it discovered an 'irregularity' in a trading position and is working with regulators to investigate the matter. 'During a recent evaluation of certain trading positions, we discovered an irregularity,' a bank spokesperson said. 'We informed regulators immediately and are working closely with authorities to thoroughly investigate the matter. Senior managers of the business are focused on the issue and believe the risks surrounding possible losses are under control.' The investigation follows the Charlotte bank's Jan. 1 acquisition of New York-based Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. The purchase gave Bank of America a much bigger investment banking and brokerage operation but it's also brought concerns about riskier trading businesses. Prior to the deal closing, Merrill posted a fourth-quarter loss of more than $15 billion.
