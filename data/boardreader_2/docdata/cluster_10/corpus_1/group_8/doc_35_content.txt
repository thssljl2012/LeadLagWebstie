New Yorks attorney-general issued subpoenas Wednesday night to seven executives from Merrill Lynch, each of whom received a bonus of more than $10m for 2008, calling on them to give depositions about the payments. Six of the seven men have stayed on with Bank of America which took over Merrill on Jan 1. Prosecutors from the office of Andrew Cuomo have been investigating the early payment of $3.6bn in cash bonuses at Merrill since late January.
