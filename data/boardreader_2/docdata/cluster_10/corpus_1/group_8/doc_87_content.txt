 Despite $27.6bn in losses in 2008, the firm's 10 highest-paid bankers took $209m in cash and stock last year, $8m more than the top 10 got in 2007.  Here's the list:  Thomas Montag, now head of global sales and trading at Bank of America - $39.4m (plus $50m in stock to replace the equity he gave up when he left Goldman Sachs)  Andrea Orcel, Merrill's top European investment banker - $33.8m  Peter Kraus, ex-head head of strategy at Merrill Lynch - $29.4m  David Goodman, now co-head of global commodities at Bank of America - $16.5m  David Gu, head of Merrill's global rates unit - $16.5m  Fares Noujaim, now head of Bank of America's Middle East &amp; Africa operations - $15m plus  David Sobotka, now global head of prop trading over at Bank of America - $13m  Finally, Bloomberg reports that New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has subpoenaed all seven of the above, as he tries to establish who knew what, when about the $3.6bn in bonuses Merrill paid its staff in December. And Bank of America asked a state judge Wednesday to order Cuomo to keep details of individual bonuses secret. The bank said that 'disclosing such highly sensitive and confidential information to the public will cause grave harm and severe competitive disadvantage'.
