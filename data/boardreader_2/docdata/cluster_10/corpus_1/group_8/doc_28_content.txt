 The N.C. Attorney General's office said Bank of America Corp. has been responsive to an investigative demand issued last month and is cooperating with the probe.   Attorney General Roy Cooper asked the bank to provide information by today on bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. employees before the Charlotte bank's Jan. 1 acquisition of the New York firm. The probe also is focused on Merrill's bigger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss of more than $15 billion and the bank's receipt of government assistance. Attorneys in our office are reviewing the information provided as part of our ongoing investigation, Noelle Talley, a spokeswoman for Cooper, said today.   Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri said the company is cooperating and continuing to provide information as requested. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is also investigating the $3.6 billion in bonuses paid to Merrill employees in December. . @Nyx.CommentBody@  Disclaimer  The Charlotte Observer is pleased to be able to offer its users the opportunity to make comments and hold conversations online.
