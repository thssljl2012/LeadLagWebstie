Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis has tried to differentiate his bank from the thoroughly impugned Citi. For a while, Lewis seemed to be successful. But as the bank's woes mount, many are lumping the two together. While Lewis maintains that Bank of America does not need another recapitalization the way Citi does, there are plenty of skeptics.  Here's one way to look at it. The latest injection of public funds into Citi was prompted by a low tangible common equity to assets ratio. Before the recap, it stood at 1.5 percent, notes The Motley Fool. Bank of America's stands now at 2.6 percent, which is the lowest of the big TARP banks. So is it high enough to keep Bank of America from the public trough? Hard to say. But with the economy souring, it is certainly not out of the question.
