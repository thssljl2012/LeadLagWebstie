NEW YORK  Bank of America Corp.s CEO is now calling his request for $20 billion in government money to support the acquisition of Merrill Lynch a tactical mistake. Ken Lewis also said he would stay on as CEO until the bank pays back all of its $45 billion in government funding, which could take two or three years.  Lewis made the comments to The Financial Times on Monday, and spokesman Robert Stickler later confirmed the remarks. Stickler noted in an e-mail that Lewis will be 65 in about three years.  The news came as Bank of Americas shares plunged alongside other bank stocks Monday. Bank of America shares dropped 32 cents, or 8.1 percent, to $3.63. On Feb. 20, shares hit a 26-year low of $2.53.  Lewis told the Financial Times that taking $20 billion from the government in January made Bank of America Corp. appear as weak as Citigroup Inc. He took it because he wanted a cushion of capital as his company absorbed the ailing investment bank Merrill Lynch, but he should have requested $10 billion instead, the CEO said in the interview.
