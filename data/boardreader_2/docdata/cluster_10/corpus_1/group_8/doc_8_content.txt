Investment bank Merrill Lynch is poring over the books of currency traders after an 'irregularity' was found within its trading operation in London.  The bank, now owned by Bank of America, has informed regulators and is working with authorities.  The announcement follows a report in the New York Times that attention was focused on the accounts of Alexis Stenfors, a foreign exchange trader.
