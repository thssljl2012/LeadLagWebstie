 Bank of America Corp. didn't pay its CEO Ken Lewis or any of its other top executives a bonus last year, like most major U.S. banks, saying its 2008 financial results didn't meet its expectations.  Lewis received the same salary as he did the year before, $1.5 million, as well as $275,125 in perks such as air travel, which was up slightly from the prior year. Lewis had received a bonus of $4.25 million in 2007.
