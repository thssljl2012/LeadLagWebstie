Change to Win Investment Group on Thursday asked Bank of America Corp.s board to fire its chairman and chief executive, Ken Lewis, over missteps regarding the companys Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. acquisition and a plummeting share price.  The activist investor group, which holds about one-half of 1 percent of the banks shares, told Bank of Americas board in a letter Thursday that Lewis failed to back away from the merger once the size of Merrills losses became clear, failed to disclose Merrills losses in a timely manner and allowed Merrill to pay $3.6 billion in bonuses to employees.
