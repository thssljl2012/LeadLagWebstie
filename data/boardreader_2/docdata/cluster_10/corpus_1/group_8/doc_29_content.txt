Bloomberg reports: New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo subpoenaed seven people who received bonuses at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said a person familiar with the matter.   Cuomo is probing $3.6 billion in bonuses given Merrill employees just before the firm merged with Bank of America Corp. on Jan. 1. Former Merrill Chief Executive Officer John Thain and Bank of America CEO Kenneth D. Lewis previously testified in Cuomo's office about the bonuses.   The seven executives will be asked questions about their individual bonuses, their communications with Thain and the timing of the bonuses, the person said. The person said the seven bonus recipients who were subpoenaed were Andrea Orcel, David Sobotka, Peter Kraus, Thomas Montag, David Gu, David Goodman and Fares Noujaim.   Scott Silvestri, a Bank of America spokesman, declined to comment. He said the bank doesn't comment on subpoenas.
