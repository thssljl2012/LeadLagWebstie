Bank of America vowed to sue a former employee if he cooperates in a state probe of $3.6 billion in Merrill Lynch bonuses doled out just before the bank took over the faltering firm.  Attorney General Andrew Cuomo Friday asked a judge to reject the bank's efforts to obstruct his ongoing investigation. Cuomo cited an e-mail threat to Greg Fleming, a former Merrill exec he subpoenaed Thursday in his probe of a flurry of bonuses that came just before the taxpayer-financed takeover.   Fleming was warned not to reveal 'confidential, proprietary information of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch regarding bonuses,' in an e-mail from Bank of America's lawyer, Lewis Liman, sources said. The message went to Fleming's lawyer, Jonathan Polkes. 'Bank of America and Merrill Lynch intend to hold your client Greg Fleming to all of his obligations to keep that information confidential including from regulators' unless a judge orders otherwise, the e-mail continued.   David Markowitz, chief of Cuomo's investor protection bureau, told a judge the e-mail threatened to sue Fleming 'to keep the subpoenaed information from the attorney general.' 'Bank of America is seeking to prevent witnesses from testifying,' Markowitz wrote, contending that the obstruction is interfering with other 'various federal and state investigatory agencies' and members of Congress. Markowitz's letter did not specify which agencies, and Cuomo's office declined to comment.   A spokesman Friday insisted the bank was merely trying to keep information about bonuses from being made public. The bank claims this information is proprietary and would be useful to its competitors, a claim Cuomo says is without merit.   Fleming's lawyer did not return a call seeking comment.
