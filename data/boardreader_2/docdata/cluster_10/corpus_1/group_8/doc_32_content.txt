NEW YORK, March 4 (Reuters) - New York state's top legal officer issued subpoenas on Wednesday to seven executives who received tens of millions of dollars in 2008 pay from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co before it was taken over by Bank of America Corp , a person familiar with the investigation said.   Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is seeking information from the executives, top earners at Merrill even as its net loss swelled last year to $27.6 billion.  Last month, Cuomo's lawyers took testimony under oath from former Merrill head John Thain and Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis, part of a probe into whether the firm broke securities laws on public disclosure of executive compensation.
