Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said yesterday it is examining some irregularities in London trading accounts and has informed regulators, but believes the risk of possible losses is 'under control.' The company disclosed it was investigating trading, following a report in The New York Times that a London-based foreign exchange trader lost more than $120-million (U.S.) while others may have lost hundreds of millions more on derivatives trading. 'During a recent evaluation of certain trading positions, we discovered an irregularity. We informed regulators immediately and are working closely with authorities to thoroughly investigate the matter. Senior managers of the business are focused on the issue and believe the risks surrounding possible losses are under control,' Merrill Lynch said in a statement. Questions about the accounts arose last month at Merrill, which was acquired by Bank of America Corp. in January, the Times report said.
