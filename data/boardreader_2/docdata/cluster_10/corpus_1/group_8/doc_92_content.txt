Search  Query:  Independent.ie Web Search  Merrill Lynch is in talks with regulators after uncovering a trading 'irregularity' in London amid heavy losses, adding to questions about the health of the business bought by Bank of America in an emergency rescue last September.  The company is particularly looking at losses generated by Alexis Stenfors, a London-based foreign exchange trader who had earlier reported a trading profit of $120m (94.7m) for the year, the New York Times reported. Others lost hundreds of millions on credit derivatives, the paper said.  The losses went undetected when Bank of America shareholders approved the merger in early December and Merrill paid out $3.6bn of bonuses.  'During a recent evaluation of certain positions, we discovered an irregularity,' the bank said in a statement without giving details. 'We informed regulators immediately and are working closely with authorities to investigate the matter.'  It added: 'Senior managers of the business are focused on the issue and believe the risks surrounding possible losses are under control.' Mr Stenfors worked at Merrill from 1995 after four years at Calyon, the securities arm of Credit Agricole.  His authority to trade was removed on February 25, according to UK Financial Services Authority records. The regulator did not immediately return calls.  Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, has been forced to cut its dividend, take a government bailout and make plans to cut 35,000 jobs after losses related to the purchase of Countrywide Financial last year and Merrill, completed in January.  New York-based Merrill, the investment bank and retail brokerage, reported a $15.3bn loss in the fourth quarter after trading losses and writedowns of toxic assets.
