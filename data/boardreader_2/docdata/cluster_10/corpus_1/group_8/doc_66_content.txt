New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is asking a judge to reject Bank of America's request to keep information confidential about bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch employees weeks before the investment firm was sold to Bank of America.  Charlotte-based Bank of America wants a temporary confidentiality order expanded to cover anyone who testifies on individual bonuses granted by Merrill.  In a request Friday to a New York State Supreme Court judge, Cuomo said Bank of America has refused to provide details of individual bonuses and threatened lawsuits against individuals who might provide the information.  Cuomo's office has been investigating the timing of $3.6 billion in bonuses Merrill paid to employees, before it was purchased by Bank of America and announced a more than $15 billion fourth-quarter loss.
