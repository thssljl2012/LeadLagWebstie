Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. Inc. chairman and chief executives has asked for a bonus of as much as $10 million, but the company's compensation committee is balking at his request, a source told The Wall Street Journal.  The board at the soon-to-be merged New York-based company is set to meet today to hear his formal bonus recommendations for himself and other senior executives.  A few months ago, Merrill was considering giving Mr. Thain a $30 million bonus, according to people familiar with the matter, because he helped avert what could have been a much larger crisis at the firm, the report said.  That number has since come down in recent talks with various board members and Mr. Thain has recently indicated to committee members that $5 million to $10 million is more reasonable.  New York state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo disagrees.  On reading the Journal report he warned Merrill not to pay significant bonuses to Mr. Thain or other top executives.  Mr. Cuomo called report nothing less than shocking.  The payment would come as thousands of Merrill employees face losing their jobs as the firm prepares to be acquired by Bank of America Corp. Merrill already cut 4,000 jobs earlier this year.  Merrill has posted net losses of $11.67 billion this year and is about to complete its acquisition by Bank of America Corp. later this month.  On Friday, shareholders of both companies separately approved the deal.  The deal, which Mr. Thain orchestrated on the night of Sept. 15, came as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. of New York filed for bankruptcy.  A call to Merrill was not immediately returned.
