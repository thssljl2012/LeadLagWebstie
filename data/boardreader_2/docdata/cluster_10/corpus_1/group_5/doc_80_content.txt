Bank of America (BAC:  ) fell in pre-market trading, on plans to reduce its workforce by between 30,000 and 35,000 positions over the next three years.  The stock was down 76 cents just after 8:20 am ET, dropping to $14.15. If pre-market losses hold, the stock will open at its lowest level in a week.  Thursday, Bank of America said that it expects to cut about 30,000 to 35,000 positions over the next three years, citing the impact of the pending merger with Merrill Lynch (MER) which is expected to close on Jan. 1, 2009, and the weak economic environment. Since the company has not completed its analysis, the final number will not be determined until early 2009.   by RTT Staff Writer  For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rtt.com Share Article:
