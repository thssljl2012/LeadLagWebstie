While banks worldwide buckle or even crumble under the pressure of a global recession, John Thain is still shooting for the starsas far as his paycheck goes, at least. The Merrill Lynch CEO is pushing for a 2008 bonus of up to $10 million after a year that brought Wall Street to a rebuilding stage but left the financial services firm relatively well off, having successfully negotiated a merger with Bank of America earlier in the year.  The Merrill Lynch board of directors meets today to discuss Thains request, which will accompany his general recommendations for bonuses across upper management. Though the investment bank lost $11.67 billion this year, they fared far better than most Wall Street firms, largely due to their announced acquisition by Bank of America in September.  The BofA-Merrill merger, which netted Merrills owners about $21 billion, received shareholder approval on Friday. Merrill shareholders will receive 0.8595 BofA shares for each Merrill share they own when the deal goes through. The merger will establish BofA as the countrys largest bank.  Thains bonus request hinges on the success of the BofA deal, which very well may have averted crisis at the investment bank. Though shareholders may agree, Merrills compensation committee is reluctant, according to the Journal.  Merrill Lynchs compensation committee consists of Armando M. Codina, Virgis W. Colbert, Aulana L. Peters, and chairman John D. Finnegan.
