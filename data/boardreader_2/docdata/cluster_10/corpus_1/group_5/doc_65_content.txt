Bank of America is considered one of the country's healthier banks, and its decision illustrates how widespread the wave of layoffs hitting the United States is. The country lost more than half a million jobs in November alone.  New York-based Citigroup Inc. has been slashing jobs the most - by next year, Citigroup expects to have shrunk its work force by 75,000, or 20 per cent, since its headcount peaked in late 2007. JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. is shedding about 7,000 employees, or 10 per cent, of its investment bank staff, and cutting 9,200 jobs at Washington Mutual Inc., the bank it acquired in September. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, are reducing their staffs by about 10 per cent.  The shotgun deal between Bank of America and Merrill, valued at $50 billion when it was initially announced in September, was struck as the solvency of investment banks was in grave doubt, and kept Merrill from a complete meltdown like the one suffered by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which was forced to file for bankruptcy. Shareholders of both companies voted to approve the deal last week and it is expected to close by Jan. 1.  Bank of America shares fell $1.78, or 11 per cent, to close at $14.91 on Thursday, while Merrill shares fell $1.43, or 10 per cent, to $12.67.  In after-hours trading, Bank of America shares rose 12 cents to $15.03, and Merrill shares rose a penny to $12.68. - AP Business Writer Ieva Augstums in Charlotte, N.C., contributed to this report.
