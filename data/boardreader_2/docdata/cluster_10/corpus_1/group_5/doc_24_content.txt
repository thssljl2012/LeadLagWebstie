SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- The chief executives of Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. will forgo their customary bonuses for 2008, as their firms seek to avoid public-relations fiascos. The online edition of The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, reported Monday that Morgan Stanley's John Mack decided to forgo his bonus because it 'would send the wrong message.' The report noted that Morgan Stanley (MS:MSNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) has accepted $10 billion from the U.S. government in return for an ownership stake, as it and other Wall Street firms struggle to cope with the economic downturn. Merrill Lynch's John Thain, the Journal reported, had originally lobbied Merrill's board for a bonus between $5 million and $10 million, saying that his shepherding of the firm into a merger with Bank of America Corp. (BAC:BACNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) in September saved it from a worse fate. However, that prompted New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo to announce that such a bonus would be 'unjustified.' Merrill announced late Monday that Thain will not get a bonus for 2008. In addition, Merrill's other four top executives, including Gregory Fleming and Robert McCann, will also go without bonuses, the firm said in a statement. 'Mr. Thain and the other executive officers believe this is the appropriate recommendation to the board for the Merrill Lynch shareholders and Merrill Lynch employees given current economic and market conditions,' the firm said. This will be the second year in a row that Mack forgoes a Morgan Stanley bonus. Analysts expect the firm to post a loss for the fourth quarter, and its shares have tumbled 70% so far this year. Merrill Lynch, for its part, had been hit hard by the credit crunch, and as a result was effectively forced into a hasty merger with Bank of America. Shareholders of the firms approved the merger Friday.  While board members agreed with Thain that the merger was the 'right move,' they were also were mindful of the fact that executives at Goldman Sachs Group (GS:GSNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:  , , ) , which performed better than Merrill, were denied bonuses, according to the Journal. In addition, as much as 20% of Merrill's employees are expected to soon lose their jobs. John Letzing is a MarketWatch reporter based in San Francisco.
