CHARLOTTE - Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis said the bank is in the "final stage of our analysis" of planned job cuts in the wake of its acquisition of Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co., according to media reports.   The Charlotte Observer reported his comments at a Charlotte Chamber of Commerce event last week. "We'll have something pretty soon," the newspaper quoted him saying.   Lewis reportedly declined to comment on a recent CNBC report that there could be as many as 30,000 layoffs coming as the bank looks to trim the operating costs of a combined Bank of America and Merrill by 10 percent through 2012.   Citing unnamed sources, CNBC had previous suggested that 10,000 jobs might be eliminated.   The Observer report said Joe Price, the bank's chief financial officer, has indicated that much of the savings will come from job cuts at both companies, particularly in back-office and support functions and overlapping roles.   That should be of particular interest in Rhode Island since Bank of America's back-office operations are spread across three major locations, the newspaper said: Charlotte, New York and Rhode Island.   Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) is one of the world's largest financial institutions, with clients in 175 nations, including 98 percent of the U.S. Fortune 500 and 80 percent of the Fortune Global 500. In the United States alone, it serves more than 56 million consumers and small businesses via more than 5,700 retail offices and 17,000 ATMs. To learn more, visit www.bankofamerica.com.
