Bank of America (BoA) has announced that it will be cutting its global workforce by between 30,000 and 35,000 during the next three years.  The cull takes into account the groups integration of Merrill Lynch, which is in the process of being acquiring for $50 billion, the takeover having been agreed during the desperate hours that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers, in September.  The enlarged group will become the biggest bank by assets in the US, employing around 308,000 worldwide and the 11% reduction in staff reflects cost savings to be achieved by the merger (said to be around $7 billion annually) and a weak economic environment.  Further details will be available in the New Year, although it is understood that the cuts will be across both businesses and will affect all areas of operation.  The news comes less than a month after Citigroup revealed plans to cut 52,000 jobs by the second half of 2009.  The 15% reduction in staff numbers is in addition to the 23,000 jobs axed since the beginning of the year.
