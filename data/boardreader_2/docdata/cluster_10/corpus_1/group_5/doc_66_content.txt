Bank of America Corporation is likely to shed a significant number of positions over the next three years, due to a pending merger with Merrill Lynch and the weak economic environment.  Both factors are being cited by management of the company who expect to have a final plan for the position shedding to be in place early in 2009.  It has been estimated that around 30,000 to 35,000 positions will be lost over the next three years.   The reductions will come from both companies and will affect all business and staff areas.
