 Shareholders of Merrill Lynch and Bank of America on Friday approved the investment banks sale to Bank of America, a move that will create the nations largest financial-services firm.  The move transforms Bank of America into a business befitting its name. A strong investment bank has been the only missing piece for the Charlotte-based bank, which has struggled to build one from within. A series of bad bets in the investment banking unit over the past year have sunk companywide profits.  The deal is expected to close by the end of the year, pending regulatory approvals.   @Nyx.CommentBody@
