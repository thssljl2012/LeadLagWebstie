From 247wallst.com  The board of Merrill Lynch (NYSE: MER) is fighting with CEO John Thain over whether he should get a bonus. The board will probably win. It is the board. And, since Merrill has been sold to Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), members don't have to look Thain in the eye any more. They can take their board fees and pay for a trip to the Netherlands Antilles.   The board is wrong about Thain. He wants $10 million and he earned it.
