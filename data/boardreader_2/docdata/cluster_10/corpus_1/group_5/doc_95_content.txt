The head of the third-largest investment bank on Wall Street, the soon-to-disappear Merrill Lynch, changed his mind and has disdained any bonus for this year. Good move. He doesnt single himself out as a greedhead. Merrills chief, John Thain, had suggested to directors of the firm that he get a $10 million bonus for 2008 for having arranged the takeover of his firm by Bank of America. What was he thinking? That he deserved a reward for pursuing the only strategy that could keep Merrill from running off the cliff?  The business world badly needs to evolve a new ethic of executive compensation, and if it fails to do so, Congress may try to impose new rules - a prospect that makes the blood run cold. Morgan Stanley, the No. 2 investment bank, is showing the way. The top three executives are getting no bonus; the echelon below them will see bonuses cut by 75 percent, and 7,000 employees have been warned that the usually deferred portion of their bonuses will not be paid at all if, after three years, anything they have done has caused the firm to restate its results. (The top officers of No. 1 Goldman Sachs also are not getting bonuses.)  Bonuses should be separate from profit-sharing, awarded only for unquestionably excellent performance and not determined by an executives friends. Clawback provisions like Morgan Stanleys should be universal.  Merrill paid Thain a signing bonus of $15 million a year ago and guaranteed a pay package of $50 million to $120 million over several years, a guarantee that is still in force. He wont need to buy bread from the day-old rack.
