NEW YORKNew York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has subpoenaed  Chief Executive Ken Lewis as part of an investigation into whether the bank misled investors about losses and executive bonuses at , The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.  The Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, also reported that former Merrill CEO John Thain was questioned by investigators on Thursday about the bonuses that were paid in late December, just days before Bank of America completed its purchase of New York-based Merrill.  Spokesman for Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America and Cuomo's office could not be immediately reached for comment late Thursday.  Last week, Cuomo said in a letter sent to U.S. House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank that the $3.6 billion in bonuses . executives received was irresponsible.  The payments came as Merrill was on the brink of reporting a more than $15 billion fourth-quarter loss. It was among the hardest hit by the ongoing credit crisis.  Cuomo said in the letter to Frank that Bank of America was apparently complicit in the move to award bonuses before Merrill's fourth quarter loss was announced.  Last week, Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri said in a statement that Merrill Lynch was an independent company last year, and its board of directors had ultimate approval over how much to pay employees.  Lewis reiterated that stance when questioned about the Merrill bonuses during Congressional testimony, saying he had 'very limited' involvement in the decision making regarding the payouts.
