Bank of America Corp. appears headed for some fireworks around April 29. Thats the tentative date for BofAs 2009 annual meeting. Given the companys recent woes and plunging stock price, the gathering promises to be a heated one for Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis and the companys board of directors.  Since mid-September, when BofA announced plans for its $29 billion purchase of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc., its stock price has dropped about 80%. BofA shares closed Tuesday at $5.56 per share. The 52-week high, hit nearly a year ago, was $43.60.  The losses at Merrill and BofAs need for a second round of government bailout money have left shareholders livid with Lewis.
