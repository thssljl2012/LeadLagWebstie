Merrill Lynch dished out a combined $121 million to the top four bonus recipients at the firm, right before Merrill was acquired by Bank of America Corp. Sheesh. Talk about shady timing.

'One disturbing question that must be answered is whether Merrill Lynch and Bank of America timed the bonuses in such a way as to force taxpayers to pay for them through the deal funding,' Cuomo wrote in a February 10 letter to Frank. The letter became public yesterday, the day that the chief executives from the eight largest U.S. banks faced the ire of lawmakers at a committee hearing in Washington.
