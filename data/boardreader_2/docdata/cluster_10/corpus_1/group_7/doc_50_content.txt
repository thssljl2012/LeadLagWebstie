CHARLOTTE, N.C. (UPI) -- Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Ken Lewis said government assistance for the U.S. financial giant had put a ripple in executive decision making.  'Obviously, with some of the second-guessing, etc., the degree of difficulty is heightened at a time you wouldn't want it to be,' Lewis told the Charlotte (N.C.) Observer.  Lewis said the bank intended to pay back the government funds 'as soon as humanely possible.'  The government has invested $45 billion in Bank of America, $20 billion of which was to help with the purchase of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. But, Lewis said he completed the purchase of Merrill Lynch only after the federal government 'strongly advised' him to, the Observer reported.  Under terms of the federal bailout, banks must pay the government dividends of 5 percent, which increase to 9 percent if the loans are not paid back after 5 years.  However, banks were also told they could not begin repayments for three years.  'In the meantime, we are using these funds to support the U.S. economy by extending credit to individuals and businesses,' Lewis said.
