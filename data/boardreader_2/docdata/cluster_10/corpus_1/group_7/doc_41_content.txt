Merrill Lynch paid nearly 700 employees more than $1 million in 2008, even though the brokerage firm lost $27 billion, according to a report in the New York Times.  The report said the payments, made just before Merrill Lynch was sold to Bank of America in December, have already stirred anger for being paid earlier than usual. 'Merrill chose to make millionaires out of a select group of 700 employees,' Andrew Cuomo, the attorney general of New York State, wrote in the letter to the House Financial Services Committee.
