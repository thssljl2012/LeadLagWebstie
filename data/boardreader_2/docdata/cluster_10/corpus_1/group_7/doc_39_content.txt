Lawmakers grilled the CEOs of the top eight U.S. banks Wednesday with questions on why fat bonuses were paid and lending hadn't improved despite the banks having taken $165 billion of taxpayer money since October. 'Why do you need to be bribed to have your interests aligned with the people who are paying your salary?' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services. 'Why do you need bonuses? Can't we just give you good salaries?' Frank and other lawmakers called on the bankers to commit that they will stall all foreclosures for at least the next three weeks as Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner hammers out a plan on how to address the issue. Citigroup and Bank of America agreed.
