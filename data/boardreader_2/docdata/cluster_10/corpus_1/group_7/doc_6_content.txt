Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis has received a subpoena from the New York state attorney general's office in connection with Merrill Lynch's payment of employee bonuses before the companies merged Jan. 1, according to a report late Thursday.  The Wall Street Journal, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter, reported that Lewis received the subpoena late last week. It said investigators took testimony all day Thursday from Merrill CEO John Thain.  New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has been investigating the $3.6 billion in bonuses that Merrill paid in December, shortly before the New York investment bank was bought by Charlotte-based Bank of America. He has also been investigating whether investors were properly informed about Merrill's finances. Cuomo said last week that Bank of America acted with "apparent complicity" in Merrill's bonus plan. Bank of America has said those bonus decisions were made by Thain and other Merrill officials. Lewis ousted Thain in January after the bonus payments were made public and it was revealed that Merrill's losses were greater than previously anticipated.  The Journal, citing a person close to the matter, said regulators were eyeing Lewis' testimony before Congress last week, when he said he had "no authority" over Merrill's bonuses, even though they were detailed in the companies' merger agreement. Bank of America declined to comment on the subpoena, the Journal said.  Bank of America chief administrative officer Steele Alphin and bank executive Andrea Smith were also subpoenaed, the Journal reported. The bank's stock, which traded at more than $40 a share a year ago, slumped to a new low of $3.93 on Thursday.
