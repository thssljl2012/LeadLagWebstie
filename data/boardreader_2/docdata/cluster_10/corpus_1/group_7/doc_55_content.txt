 Bank of America Corp. job cuts hit home again in Charlotte today, with higher-level employees in technology and operations losing their positions in locations around the country, sources told the Observer.   The Charlotte bank in December said it was eliminating 35,000 employees companywide over three years as part of its Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. acquisition and a weak economy. Bank of America has declined to give specifics on the departments and cities where it's eliminating jobs.  Spokesman Scott Silvestri today said the job cuts are ongoing. The process has started, he said. Since December, Bank of America has filed one layoff notice with N.C. officials, signaling 139 job cuts at a Ballantyne location. After the Merrill acquisition, Bank of America had about 301,000 employees. . @Nyx.CommentBody@  Disclaimer  The Charlotte Observer is pleased to be able to offer its users the opportunity to make comments and hold conversations online.
