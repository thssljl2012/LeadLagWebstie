THE CREDIT CRISIS HAS opened a rift in the financial industry, as bankers at small community institutions try to convince a skeptical public that they're still viable and open for business despite numbing losses for some of the biggest players.  Community bankers who serve small geographic areas say they're suffering from an image problem hastened by tottering giants like Citigroup and Bank of America, and nonbank financial firms such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Bros. and AIG.  'There's a big difference between the bankers in this room and Wall Street,' Edward Yingling, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, said during a conference last week in Phoenix with roughly 1,000 community bankers. Perceptions that most or all commercial banks are nearing bankruptcy 'are simply not true.'  Nor did most firms engage in heavy subprime lending, derivative investments or other strategies that deviated from traditional banking, Yingling said, adding that community bankers also are battling misconceptions that most received federal bailout money and have stopped lending.  'In 2008, despite the recession, bank lending actually increased, but you wouldn't know it,' he said.  Bankers at the conference didn't express many expectations for a quick recovery for the industry or economy.  Elizabeth Duke, a member of the Federal Reserve board of governors, predicted foreclosures will remain 'elevated for some time' and urged bankers to make efforts to work with borrowers to modify loans on easier terms.  Duke noted foreclosures have spread to rental homes, often resulting in evictions for tenants.
