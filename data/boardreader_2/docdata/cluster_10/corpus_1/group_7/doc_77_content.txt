The US government may end up holding as much as 40% of Citigroup's common stock, the Wall Street Journal reported on its website, citing sources familiar with the plans.  Citigroup executives are hoping the talks with US federal officials will result in a stake closer to 25%, the Journal reported.  The paper, citing a spokesman at the US lender, also reported that Bank of America is not discussing a larger ownership stake for the US government.  The euro jumped to the day's highs against the US dollar and the yen on the report, climbing 0.5% to $US1.2883 and 0.6% to 120.17 yen.
