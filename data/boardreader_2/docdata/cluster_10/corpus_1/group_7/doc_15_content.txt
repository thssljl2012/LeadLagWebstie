CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Bank of America Corp. CEO Ken Lewis capped off a week of defending his bank and his role in it on Friday by firing back against reports that his company could be in danger of nationalization.  'It's absurd,' Lewis said in an interview on CNBC.  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and other top officials are close to finishing a plan to overhaul the government's $700-billion financial rescue fund.  Lewis said the banking giant would not need additional federal funding.
