MIRAMAR, Fla. -- Two South Florida banks are joining some of the country's largest lenders in temporarily halting foreclosures as the federal government tackles the housing crisis.  The announcement comes just as President Barack Obama prepares to sign into law the most sweeping economic package in decades, a rescue plan that provides financial incentives for people to start buying again, from first homes to new cars.  On Wednesday, Obama is expected to reveal another part of his plan, one designed to help millions of homeowners fight foreclosure. But some South Floridians will not have to wait until Wednesday.  Coral Gables-based BankUnited said it is halting foreclosures for at least a month. More than 1,000 homeowners are expected to hear from the bank that their homes will not be foreclosed. The announcement will affect 1,400 homes in Florida, which is worth about $426 million in mortgages.  Fort Lauderdale-based Bank Atlantic is also following suit after Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and major banks JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. said they were halting foreclosures for at least a month."I think it would be a good thing at least for the time being giving things being as uncertain as they are with the bailout," one South Floridian said.Others said it's just a temporary solution."It's some kind of a band-aid," another resident said. "It's not going to resolve. I think the patients are sick, but they are still avoiding treatment."Florida is second in the U.S. with the highest foreclosure rate. It is one of four states -- along with California, Nevada and Arizona -- that accounted for nearly half the nation's 2008 foreclosures, according to RealtyTrac Inc.  Those four states make up 50 percent of the home foreclosures in all of the U.S.  More than 2.3 million homeowners faced foreclosure proceedings last year, an 81 percent increase from 2007.
