CHARLOTTE, N.C. Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Ken Lewis capped off a week of defending his bank and his role in it on Friday by firing back against rumors that his company could be in danger of nationalization.  'It's absurd,' Lewis said in an interview on CNBC, adding that he knows of no government officials who have talked about nationalizing the bank.  Speaking generally about the banking industry, Lewis reiterated the strength of his Charlotte, N.C.-based company, saying that BofA would not need additional federal funding.
