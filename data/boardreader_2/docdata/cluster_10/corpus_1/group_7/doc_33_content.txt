The son of a butcher, Angelo Mozilo co-founded Countrywide in 1969 and built it into the largest mortgage lender in the United States. Countrywide wasn't the first to make exotic mortgages to borrowers with questionable ability to repay, but it did, in its all-out embrace of such sales, legitimize the notion that practically any adult could handle a big, fat mortgage. In the wake of the housing bust, which toppled Countrywide and IndyMac Bank (another company Mozilo started), the executive's lavish pay package was criticized by many, including Congress. Mozilo left Countrywide in the summer of 2008, after its rescue-sale to Bank of America. A few months later, B of A said it would spend up to $8.7 billion to settle predatory lending charges against Countrywide filed by 11 state attorney generals.
