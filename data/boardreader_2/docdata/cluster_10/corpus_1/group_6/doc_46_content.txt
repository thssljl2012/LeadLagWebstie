U.S. stock market report 1006 ET 13Jan2009 Citi sees Internet penetration growth in 2009 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Citi Tuesday said it had a cautious outlook for large cap Internet stocks in 2009, seeing 'very muted growth' for advertising, retail and travel. The group 'remains heavily consumer discretionary spend dependent -- hence, severe recession risk,' it said.  Despite that, the firm also argued that penetration rates should continue to rise across advertising, retail and travel segments, 'generating relatively robust top-line growth for leading Internet companies, especially market share gainers like Amazon, Google and Priceline.'

The markets were also impacted by comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who said the Fed still had tools to prevent balance sheet shrinkage, and by crude oil, which erased early losses to trade modestly higher.  The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3 percent to 8,451.87 while the S&amp;amp;P 500 slid 0.4 percent to 867.25 and the Nasdaq was down 0.2 percent to 1,536.54.

It expects capital ratios will remain under pressure.  The firm slashed its earnings outlook for several large banks, including Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, among others. For the current fiscal year, JPMorgan sees earnings of 89 cents a share for Bank of America, a loss of $3.25 a share for Citigroup and earnings of $1.95 a share for Wells Fargo. It previously saw earnings of $2.76 a share, a loss of $1.71 a share and earnings of $2.22 a share, respectively.

Reuters Messaging: ryan.vlastelica.reuters.com@reuters.net 0847 ET 13Jan2009-ML: 2009 will be as hard on CMBS as 2008 was ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Merrill Lynch on Tuesday said it expected 2009 to be as hard a year for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) as 2008 was. 'Our outlook is for property values to fall and CMBS credit problems to ratchet up as the economic landscape is negative,' it wrote.  The firm sees a further decline of about 20 percent in commercial real estate values and said that financing would be difficult to obtain. 'Even if available, is likely to have lower leverage. We think this and a poor economic environment will send cap rates higher and they could eventually reach 9-10 percent.'
