Bank of America Corp. told employees today that it will continue using the Merrill Lynch name and bull symbol for its wealth management and brokerage businesses.  The Charlotte-based bank, which bought Merrill Lynch on Jan. 1, will use both names -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- for the company's combined corporate, commercial, investment banking and capital markets operations. These businesses will carry Bank of America's familiar 'flagscape' symbol, which has been in use since 1999.  The bank had previously indicated that it planned to hold onto the Merrill Lynch brand tied to the firm's 'Thundering Herd' of stock brokers. A bank spokesman said the final decision came after months of market research. 'Our research showed that while the Bank of America brand dominated the consumer, small business and commercial businesses, the Merrill Lynch brand dominated the wealth management and brokerage business, and each brought strengths to the corporate and institutional businesses,' Bank of America's chief marketing officer Anne Finucane said in a memo today.  Bank of America's corporate name and logo will stay the same and remain affixed to bank branches and credit cards. The bank also will continue to use the Columbia name for its asset management arm and the U.S. Trust brand for its private bank.  Bank spokesman Joe Goode said the new brands will be rolled out as the businesses are fully integrated.
