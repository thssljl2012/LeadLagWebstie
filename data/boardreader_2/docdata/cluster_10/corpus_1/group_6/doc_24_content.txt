Bank of America Corporation has completed its purchase of Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co., Inc.  'We created this new organization because we believe that wealthmanagement and corporate and investment banking represent significant growthopportunities, especially when combined with our leading capabilities inconsumer and commercial banking,' said Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis. 'We are now uniquely positioned to win market share and expand our leadership position in markets around the world.'  Bank of America will have the largest wealth management business in the world with approximately 20,000 financial advisors and more than $2 trillion in client assets. Global investment management capabilities will include approximately 50 percent ownership in BlackRock Inc., which at September 30 had $1.26 trillion in assets under management. Bank of America had $564 billion in assets under management in the same period. Black Rock has operations in north Wilmington.  The agreement is expected to be followed by job reductions throughout Bank of America that also reflect  slowdowns in businesses, such as credit cards. Bank of America is projecting $7 billion in cost savings. Bank of America will face a delicate balancing act in cutting costs and holding on to top-performing brokers.  Under terms of the agreement, shareholders of Merrill Lynch received .8595 shares of Bank of America common stock for each common share of Merrill Lynch.
