- Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) today reported full-year 2008 profit of $4.01 billion compared with net income of $14.98 billion a year earlier.  The Earnings after preferred dividends and available to common shareholders were $2.56 billion, or $0.55 per diluted share, down from $14.80 billion, or $3.30 per share.  In the fourth quarter of 2008, the company had a net loss of $1.79 billion compared with net income of $268 million a year earlier. The net loss applicable to common shareholders was $2.39 billion, or $0.48 per diluted share, down from net income of $215 million, or $0.05 per share, in the same period in 2007. Results include Countrywide Financial, which Bank of America purchased on July 1, but not Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc., which was acquired on January 1, 2009.  Fourth quarter results were driven by escalating credit costs, including additions to reserves, and significant writedowns and trading losses in the capital markets businesses. These actions reflect the deepening economic recession and extremely challenging financial environment, both of which significantly intensified in the last three months of 2008.  Global Consumer and Small Business Banking and Global Wealth and Investment Management were profitable, paced by Bank of America's successful and expanding deposit business. Negative results in Capital Markets and Advisory Services masked the profitability in Business Lending and Treasury Services within Global Corporate and Investment Banking.  Bank of America ended 2008 with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 9.15 percent.  Merrill Lynch preliminary results indicate a fourth-quarter net loss of $15.31 billion, or $9.62 per diluted share, driven by severe capital markets dislocations.  In light of continuing severe economic and financial market conditions, the Bank of America Board of Directors has declared a first-quarter dividend of $.01 per share payable March 27, 2009 to shareholders of record as of March 6, 2009.  Combined, these actions strengthen Bank of America and will allow the company to continue business levels that both support the U.S. economy and create future value for shareholders.
