The federal government is considering a fresh multibillion-dollar aid package for Bank of America Corp. to help it absorb losses at Merrill Lynch.  A person with knowledge of the discussions says the new aid package could be modeled along the lines of the financial lifeline that was thrown to Citigroup Inc. in November. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the discussions.  The Citigroup rescue involved a fresh capital infusion and government backing of billions in risky assets held by the bank.
