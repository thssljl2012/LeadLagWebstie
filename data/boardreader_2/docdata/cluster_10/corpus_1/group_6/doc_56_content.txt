'Presently, these companies have market capitalizations that are approximately 10.2 percent of their deposits,' it said, noting that JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup all had ratios below this. The three 'are selling below the cost of replicating their deposit gathering capabilities due to fears of excessive loan losses,' Bove wrote.
