NEW YORK, Jan 8 (Reuters) - President of Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co Inc Greg Fleming is going to leave the bank now that its acquisition by Bank of America Corp has been completed, CNBC reported on Thursday.   Fleming, who was set to head corporate and investment banking after the banks combined on Jan. 1, is instead going to Yale University, CNBC reported.  Earlier this week, Merrill's brokerage head, Bob McCann, announced plans to step down from the company, and on Thursday a senior executive in London, Brent Clapacs, said he was leaving.  Many other Merrill executives have kept their jobs at the bank, including former Chief Executive John Thain, who is now president of global banking, securities and wealth management.
