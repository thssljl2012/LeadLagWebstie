Greg Fleming, head of investment banking at Merrill Lynch, is leaving scarcely a week after it was acquired by Bank of America. Once considered a candidate for the top job at Merrill after the ouster of Stan ONeal in 2007, Flemings exit comes three days after the resignation of Robert McCann, head of Merrills thundering herd of 16,000 financial advisers, and raises questions about the potential for more departures of senior Merrill executives. A culture clash is expected to emerge between executives at BofAs North Carolina HQ and Merrills offices in New York.
