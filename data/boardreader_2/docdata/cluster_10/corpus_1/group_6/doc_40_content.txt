The USA's largest lender in terms of assets, Bank of America Corp, may post a $3.6bn fourth quarter loss and again cut its quarterly dividend, according to a report by Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz, cited by Bloomberg. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based is likely to report a loss of 75 cents a share, compared with an earlier estimate of a 2 cents-a-share profit, Horowitz said. The bank may also reduce its dividend to 5 cents a share from 32 cents, he added.
