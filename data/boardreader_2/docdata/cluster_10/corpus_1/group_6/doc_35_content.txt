CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Bank of America says the former president of Merrill Lynch is leaving after his company was acquired by the Charlotte-based bank.  The Charlotte Observer reported Friday that Greg Fleming had been in line to lead the corporate and investment banking unit at Bank of America, but instead is taking a teaching job at Yale University.  His departure comes a week after Bank of America acquired his New York-based investment firm. Bank of America closed on the $50 billion acquisition last week.  Another former Merrill Lynch leader also has left Bank of America. Bob McCann was picked to lead the combined brokerage unit, but said Monday he was leaving.  Bank of America has said it plans to cut up to 35,000 jobs across the company over three years in the Merrill Lynch acquisition.
