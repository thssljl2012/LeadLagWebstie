According to a regulatory filing, Bank of America sold 400,000 shares of preferred stock and issued warrants to purchase an additional 48.7 million shares of common stock to the U.S. Treasury for a purchase price of $10 billion. According to the filing, the warrants have an exercise price of $30.79.   The sale of the preferred stock and warrants follows Bank of America's merger with Merrill Lynch that had an agreement to sell $10 billion in preferred stock and warrants to the Treasury, but because the companies merged before Merrill could issue and sell them, Bank of America agreed to sell its securities.   Under a prior agreement in October of last year, Bank of America sold $15 billion in preferred stock and warrants to the Treasury.   SOUND OFF!
