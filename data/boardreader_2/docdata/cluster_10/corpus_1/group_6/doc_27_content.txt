Lewis, who has helped navigate the countrys largest commercial bank through a series of mergers in addition to the market turmoil of 2008, claimed that to issue bonuses after having incurred consistent losses would be inappropriate.  Though BofA has suffered five straight quarters of declining profit, the bank has made serious gains throughout the financial crisis, most notably in acquiring rivals Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch. This was a difficult decision, said Lewis, because we have worked hard and made progress on many projects that will create value for our company in future years. Nonetheless we are a pay-for-performance company.  Lewiss recommendation comes on the heels of a number of similar denials at major financial firms where year-end bonuses generally make up a significant portion of executive salary. These other firms include Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley, all of whom have denied bonuses to top managers while leaving lower-level bonuses relatively intact.  Like all financial firms, BofA has suffered through the global recession, with share prices dropping by about 60 percent in 2008. The bank will announce its fourth-quarter earnings on January 20.
