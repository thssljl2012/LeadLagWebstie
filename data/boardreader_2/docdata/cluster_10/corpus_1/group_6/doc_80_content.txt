NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- The news out of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. is not good, but don't blame the bank. It's rough out there in the financial world. The economy is sputtering. Jobs are being lost. The real estate market is on life support. Companies are running into trouble. That's a deadly combination for a bank that makes its living by financing growth for corporations and consumers. For the better part of 2008, J.P. Morgan's (: Last: Delayed quote data Analyst   Create alert Insider   Discuss Financials , , ) results -- $5.3 billion in profits, even with $11 billion in write-downs -- topped the results of competitors because the bank's balance sheet woes were far milder, and also because it was still making money. The bank was doing well enough that Jamie Dimon, chief executive, was able to build his franchise by acquiring two competitors while keeping capital needs manageable. The results announced Thursday suggest J.P. Morgan's balance sheet still isn't of the toxic variety when compared to that of Citigroup Inc. (C:C Last: Delayed quote data Analyst   Create alert Insider   Discuss Financials   , , ) , which analysts expect will post another multi-billion-dollar loss, and Bank of America Corp. (BAC:BAC Last: Delayed quote data Analyst   Create alert Insider   Discuss Financials   , , ) , which may need billions more from the government to stem losses at Merrill Lynch.  The 'acquisition of Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns look favorable and will likely add to profitability in '09,' said Stuart Plesser, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's equity group. 'Capital ratios look strong relative to peers, with a tangible equity ratio of 3.8%, obviating, in our opinion, the need for additional capital at present.'  J.P. Morgan is ready. It just needs the rest of the marketplace, the economy and its peers to follow its lead.
