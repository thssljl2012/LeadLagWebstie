Troubled Bank To Receive Capital, Government Guarantees  UPDATED: 12:31 am MST January 16, 2009  NEW YORK -- Bank of America has reached an agreement for an additional $20 billion in support from the government's emergency bailout fund.  The deal also provides government guarantees against losses on up to $118 billion in troubled assets.  The agreement was announced shortly after midnight Friday following marathon negotiations between the bank and federal officials.  The $20 billion injection of fresh capital will be similar to assistance provided in November to another troubled bank, Citigroup.  Bank of America will use the money from the rescue fund to help it absorb losses at Merill Lynch.  The loan guarantees will cover about $118 billion in loans and other holdings such as securities backed by residential and commercial real estate loans. Most of the holdings were obtained by the bank in the Merill Lynch acquisition.  The injection of fresh capital will come from the government's $700 billion rescue fund and will be similar to assistance provided last November to Citigroup.
