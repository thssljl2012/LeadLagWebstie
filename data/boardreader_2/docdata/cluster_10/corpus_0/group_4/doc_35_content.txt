There&amp;#8217;s also a quote in there that says Citigroup will leave 300,000 jobs intact &amp;#8220;in the near term&amp;#8221;.  Will other company&amp;#8217;s follow suit?  Keep saving your money&amp;#8230;.cut the spending, it&amp;#8217;s going to be a bumpy next 12-18 months.  BBC News US bank Citigroup has announced plans for about 53,000 new job cuts, on top of a previously announced 22,000.  Citigroup said the 75,000 job cuts represented a reduction of about 20% of its staff, leaving it with 300,000 jobs worldwide &amp;#8220;in the near term&amp;#8221;.  The cuts will come from redundancies, the sale of units and natural wastage, the bank said.  Citigroup has lost more than $20bn (13.6bn) in the past year because of the global financial crisis.  It has posted four straight quarterly losses and some analysts believe the bank will not make a profit again until 2010.  Turnaround plan &amp;#8220;Underlying business remains strong and revenues have been stable,&amp;#8221; the bank said.  Citigroup also said its capital position was &amp;#8220;very strong&amp;#8221;.  The bank expects its expenses to be down 20% from peak levels, to about $50bn in 2009, after the job cuts have taken effect.  &amp;#8220;Certainly [the job cuts] will fall particularly heavily on London and New York,&amp;#8221; Citigroup chairman Win Bischoff said at a business forum in Dubai.  Citigroup&amp;#8217;s chief executive Vikram Pandit has come under pressure from critics who have doubted his ability to turn around the company and weather the financial crisis.  Shares in Citigroup dropped 4.4% to $9.10 in early trading. They are down almost 70% this year.  Citigroup, one of the largest US banks, is one of nine financial institutions benefiting from the US government&amp;#8217;s bail-out programme.  The Treasury announced last month that it would be providing cash injections worth $125bn to be shared between Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon, State Street and Merrill Lynch.  original article
