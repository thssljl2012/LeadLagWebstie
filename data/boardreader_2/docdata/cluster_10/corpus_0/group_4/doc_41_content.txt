Over the last 18 months I have successfully negotiated several short sales for my clients...I have been keeping a spreadsheet with all of the lender loss mitigation contact information. Not sure how current all of this information is (these numbers seem to change all the time), but if you are trying to get in touch with your mortgage company's loss mitigation department (sometimes referred to as HOPE Department, Work-Out Department, Short Sale Department, etc. - it's different at each lender), here are some additional numbers to try.American Servicing Company 866-480-5004Bank of America 800-846-2222Carrington Mortgage Services 800-790-9502Chase 800-446-8939CitiMortgage 866-357-0615Comerica 800-437-5822Countrywide 866-880-1232Downey Savings &amp; Loan Association 1-800-824-6902EMC 866-275-6095GMAC 800-627-0128HFC / Beneficial Finance 800-333-5848Homecomings Financial 800-206-2901HomEq Servicing 800-414-0969HSBC 888-648-3124Litton Loan Servicing 800-247-9727Option One Mortgage 888- 275-2648PHH Mortgage Services 800-750-2518Suntrust Mortgage 800-443-1032Taylor, Bean &amp; Whittaker 800-530-2602U.S. Bank 800-365-7772Wachovia 800-282-3451Washington Mutual 866-926-8937Wells Fargo Bank 800-678-7986Wilshire Credit Corporation 888-952-7339
