The proposed government bailouts have too many zeros for me to keep up with. We now hear that Freddie Mac just posted a $25.3 billion loss in the third quarter and needs $13.8 before the end of November to cover obligations. As has been reported the federal government has pledged to provide $200 billion in aide to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It will be interesting to watch and hear the Capitol Hill exchanges between the CEO&amp;#8217;s of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee when they meet next week. The AP reports that &amp;#8220;both companies have been asked to turn over a long list of documents and e-mail messages concerning the risks the companies took in their mortgage investments, accounting, and compensation for the companies&amp;#8217; former CEOs.&amp;#8221;  A few relevant Questions. What&amp;#8217;s your opinion of this government bailout? What happens if we don&amp;#8217;t bail them out? How do you feel about other possible bailouts such as GM and Chrysler? Another major bailout was for that insurance giant AIG. We initially offered $85 billion only to learn that they want an additional $37.9 billion dollars. Should there be a litmus test where some qualify for the handout and others do not? If so how and where do we set the bar?
