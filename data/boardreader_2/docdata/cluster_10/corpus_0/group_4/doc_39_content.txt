                       How do you avoid paying jumbo mortgage rates on a jumbo-sized mortgage?&amp;nbsp;   You go off the beaten path to find a lender, that's how.  It's pretty simple when we break it down. The word &amp;quot;jumbo&amp;quot; is a Wall Street-specific term for home loans larger than $417,000.&amp;nbsp; In certain &amp;quot;high-cost&amp;quot; areas, the number can be as high $729,750.&amp;nbsp;   Lately, though, rates on jumbo mortgages have been awful compared to its cousin, the conforming mortgage.&amp;nbsp; In addition, jumbo mortgages carry significantly higher loan fees.&amp;nbsp;   The price disparity is even worse for so-called &amp;quot;Super Jumbo&amp;quot; mortgages.&amp;nbsp; A super jumbo mortgage is similar to a jumbo mortgage, but bigger.  But the thing is, the terms &amp;quot;jumbo mortgage&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;super jumbo mortgage&amp;quot; -- these are words for a Wall Street-bound loan.&amp;nbsp; They're buckets into which certain mortgages are crammed for purposes of a classification. Just because your loan size exceeds $417,000 doesn't mean that you have to suffer.&amp;nbsp;   Avoiding the high rates and loan fees of a jumbo or super-jumbo mortgage is easy -- all you have to do is keep your loan away from Wall Street.  Because Wall Street created the convention of &amp;quot;jumbo&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;super jumbo&amp;quot; home loans, a non-Wall Street loan isn't subject to the same restrictions.&amp;nbsp; This is why bypassing your neighborhood Big Bank in favor of a smaller, niche mortgage lender could be a sound mortgage decision.&amp;nbsp;   Different from Big Banks, niche mortgage lenders don't package their mortgages for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and this allows them to make their own mortgage lending rules -- some of which look like blasphemy to the Big Bank crowd:  PMI typically not required above 80% loan-to-value  100% of funds needed at closing can be gifted from anywhere  Closing within a LLC or other corporation is permitted  And, on top of that, mortgage rates with niche mortgage lenders smoke what Wall Street has to offer.  I am currently quoting a $2,000,000, 7-year ARM at 5.500 percent from a niche lender in my stable.&amp;nbsp; For comarison, I tried shopping the same product at several Big Banks -- none of them would even look at the loan, let alone try to price it.  And, there are plenty of other examples like this, too.&amp;nbsp;   Consider the following niche lender mortgage scenarios, each of which is carrying a mid-5-percent mortgage rate as of this morning:  $900,000 mortgage with 10 percent down, primary residence  $1.5 million mortgage with 30 percent down, vacation home  $2.0 million mortgage with 30 percent down, primary residence  Again, none of these mortgages are approvable through traditional banks channels including Chase, Bank of America, Citibank, and Wells Fargo.&amp;nbsp; It takes a niche lender to get it done.&amp;nbsp;   Now, finding niche lenders isn't always easy, but it can be worth the extra effort.&amp;nbsp; Mortgage rates are often lower, downpayment requirements are often smaller, and the underwriting process is often smoother.&amp;nbsp; As a mortgage broker, I work with a lot of them.  If you're having trouble finding a bank to service your &amp;quot;large loan&amp;quot;, send me an email anytime.&amp;nbsp; I lend in all 50 states and am sure I can help you find one.
