        Ok , lets cut to the chase , I want to know what the hell Derivatives have to do with the Government &amp;amp; the average American?&amp;#0160;     The sums of money traded are truly staggering and moreover, everyone is involved. For instance AIG the insurance company now being operated by the Treasury and Fed, hold the pension money for many state employees up and down the country. That means money for Teachers, Police, Fire and Health Workers.&amp;#0160;AIG (London) had positions in the Credit Default Swaps (CDS) with Lehman London. When Lehman went bankrupt AIG hit a liquidity problem. Their money was tied up in the now defunct Lehman and lenders who provided the leverage to fund the positions were asking AIG to supply more collateral. It could not pay up and had to be bailed out by the authorities. &amp;#0160;In the end AIG were strangled by a liquidity constraint brought on by a derivative bet gone wrong.The end result of all of this for the average American means among other things a declining value in their 401K's (see yesterday's post). That simply means many people with have to work for longer. Student loans are already harder to get. Auto loans too, in fact any kind of loan for all consumer and investment purposes will contract. If businessman don't get loans, it becomes harder to invest, without investment there can be no growth in GDP and therefore no growth in employment. If consumer cant get loans they cant buy (or not as easily) the products made by the businessman.&amp;#0160;So these are the ways the average American is impacted by the crisis. All of that gives the government of the day a huge problem. It has to be running around putting out fires as the authorities have been doing.
