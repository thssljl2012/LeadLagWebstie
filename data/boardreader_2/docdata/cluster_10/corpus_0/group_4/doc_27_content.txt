Picture this: You give your hard-pressed brother-in-law $15,000 to help him through some financial problems at his business. But lo and behold, he uses abouthalfthat amount to invest in a similar far-away operation.Does that trigger grumbling?Nowsubstitute Bank of America for the in-law, illustrates Grumpy Editor.The U.S. Treasury Department recently decides to pump $15 billion of taxpayer funds into Bank of America in efforts to boost lending in the current credit crisis. Then on Monday, BofA announces it is raising its stake in China Construction Bank Corp. by more than $7 billion.Much like BofA in the U.S., China Construction is a leading commercial bank, providing a range of commercial banking products and services through three principal business segments: corporate banking, personal banking and treasury operations. With 13,629 branches, its products and services include residential mortgages, bank cards what it calls infrastructure loans.Investors and the more than 59 million consumers and small businesses of BofA may be a bit irritated by the action that gives the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank a 19.1 percent stake in the Chinese state-owned bank.Investors are mumbling because BofA in early October cut its quarterly dividend in half --- to 32 cents a share from 64. It marks the first time in 30 years that the bank did not increase its payout. At the time, the nations largest bank by assets said the dividend reduction would save it $1.4 billion a quarter.BofAs shares have fallen about 65 percent in the past year.The bank is digesting the July acquisition of Countrywide Financial Corp. and two months ago it agreed to buy Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in a deal expected to close by year-end.
