 Another day. Another triple-digit loss. Investors bailed from the market as more layoffs in the financial sector surfaced in the wake of the weakened economy. The Dow closed Monday down 223.73, or 2.63%, to 8,273.58 while the Nasdaq declined 34.80, or 2.29%, to 1,482.05. Citigroup Inc. plans to lay off 50,000 while competitor J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. may cut 3,000 from its headcount. Meanwhile, the New York Post reports that CEO Lloyd Blankfein and six of his deputies will forgo their year-end bonuses. The numbers saved is unknown, but if last year's total compensation of Blankfein, two co-presidents and CFO are any barometer, the amount is likely huge. A large percentage of total compensation comprises bonus money. In 2007, Blankfein's total pay was $68.5 billion, co-presidents Jon Winkelried and  Gary Cohn each earned $67.5 billion, and CFO David Viniar was paid $57.5 billion. All four will receive a salary of $600,000 in 2008.  Lastly, shares of life insurer Genworth Financial Inc. dropped 5% after the company said it would acquire small thrift InterBank fsb, with the hopes of receiving aid from the government's $700 billion bailout. - Gerald Magpily  &amp;nbsp;                Troubled Wall Street        Prices at close                  Name       Price at          open       Price          at close        Change       Mkt cap                 J.P.
