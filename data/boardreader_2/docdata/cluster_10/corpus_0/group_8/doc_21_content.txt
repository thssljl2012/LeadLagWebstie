 Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis told the Financial Times that his company didn&#8217;t really need half of the $20 billion in TARP money it got to help ease its purchase of Merill Lynch. He now says it was a mistake for BOA to take that much money because it signaled to the markets that BOA was in the same category as Citi, when in fact it was much stronger financially. He told the Times that he should&#8217;ve asked for only $10 billion, but the company &#8220;wanted a cushion.&#8221;  So the taxpayers wasted $10 BILLION because Bank of America &#8220;wanted a cushion&#8221; to ease its purchase of Merrill Lynch. Which makes one wonder where the government oversight of this and all the rest of the bailout money has been. Obviously the government has been freely handing out too much money. Merill Lynch gave $3.6 billion in bonuses just before its $15 billion fourth quarter losses were announced and just before the deal with BOA was completed. But to have the chairman of Bank of America admit that his company didn&#8217;t need $10 billion it got from Washington is head-spinning. How much of the rest of the TARP money was squandered? We&#8217;ll probably never know.
