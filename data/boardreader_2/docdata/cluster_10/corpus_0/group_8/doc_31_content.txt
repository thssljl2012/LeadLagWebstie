Some numbers are so big you just have to stand back and admire them. An investment banker claiming $550 million of fees in a single year is just such a number. Merrill Lynch Investment banker Andrea Orcel received $33.8 million in cash and stock.  The number is staggering for an industry in which a great year means an investment banker brought in $25 million in fees and $40 million of fees makes a Wall Streeter a star.  Then there is Merrill Lynch banker Andrea Orcel laying claim to bringing in more than 13 times that for his firm, or $550 million in fees, according to this Wall Street Journal article by our colleague Susanne Craig. That earned Orcel a 2008 bonus of $33.6 million&#8211;down just a smidge from the $38 million he received in the M&#038;A boom year of 2007.  Investment bankers&#8217; bonuses are based in large part on the credit the individual bankers claim for the deals they worked on. As today&#8217;s Page One Journal article notes, Orcel won a big one-time bonus of $12 million in 2007 just for advising the Royal Bank of Scotland Group-led $101 billion acquisition of Dutch bank ABN Amro. Yet, considering that multimillion-dollar bonuses are riding on the information, the process of claiming credit at many investment banks isn&#8217;t as formal as one might think. Bankers typically write down the names of the deals they want credit for working on, and their bosses negotiate the yearly compensation from there. There is no exact formula for the link between the fees a banker brings in for his company and his actual compensation, partly because bankers often share credit with other banks and bankers for the mergers they advise on and the capital-raisings they ease through the markets.  Then there are the different fee structures. Companies involved in mergers or acquisitions typically pay their investment banks a little bit less than 1% of the total announced value of the deal. The percentages are higher for capital-raisings, where fees on initial public offerings can be around 7% of gross proceeds, while a big bond sale can bring a bank around 4% of proceeds. Of course, capital-markets fees are much more likely to be spread among more people, since banks have to pay for the big team of bankers, equity and bond market professionals that price the deals, and sales forces that market them to investors.  Orcel is known for advising big European financial institutions on mergers and acquisitions. But last year, many financial institutions&#8211;including Royal Bank of Scotland&#8211;weren&#8217;t buying; they were being nationalized. And while many did complete rights offerings that raised billions of dollars, the fees on those sales would have to be shared with a large team.  Merrill didn&#8217;t disclose the deals on which Orcel was credited for work. And a Merrill representative declined to comment for this post on behalf of Orcel.  So to get a sense of what would go into $500 million of fees, Deal Journal put together a list of the largest fees on the largest U.S. mergers and acquisitions of 2008, regardless of sector. These aren&#8217;t deals Orcel advised on&#8211;they just give a sense of a scale. The numbers come from our friends at FactSet MergerMetrics, which pulled the data from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosures by the companies involved. If a bank&#8217;s fee wasn&#8217;t disclosed, it isn&#8217;t included here. In many cases, more than one bank advised, so we picked the bank with the highest disclosed fee.  Anheuser-Busch on its $54 billion takeover by InBev: $40 million to Goldman Sachs Group Merrill Lynch on its $50 billion acquisition by Bank of America: $25 million to Merrill Lynch&#8217;s own bankers.  Wrigley&#8217;s acquisition of Mars: $46 million to Goldman Sachs, which advised Wrigley Wachovia on its $15 billion acquisition by Wells Fargo: $25 million to Goldman Sachs and $25 million to Perella Weinberg.  Rohm &#038; Haas on its pending $15.3 billion takeover by Dow Chemical: $47 million to Goldman Sachs. Electronic Data Systems on its $13.9 billion sale to Hewlett-Packard: $30 million to Citigroup.  UST on its $10.4 billion acquisition by Altria: $36 million to Citigroup.  NYMEX Holdings&#8217; $9.5 billion sale to CME: $22.29 million each to J.P. Morgan and Merrill Lynch.  Alpha Natural Resources on its proposed $10 billion sale to Cleveland Cliffs: $26 million to Citigroup. Barr Pharmaceutical&#8217;s proposed $7.46 billion sale to Teva: $40 million to Banc of America Securities. Totaling up the fees paid to the lead advisers on the 10 of the biggest deals of 2008 equals only $337 million, a number still $213 million short of Orcel&#8217;s total. And Orcel isn&#8217;t off to a bad start for 2009, having just advised on the merger of troubled French banks Caisse D&#8217;Epargne and Banque Populaire. But even those two struggling banks needed a $7 billion capital infusion from the French government to make their deal work.
