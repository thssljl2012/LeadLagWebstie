Some good work by the WSJ in looking under the TARP. In Saturday's Wall Street Journal, Serena Ng and Carrick Mollenkamp report that Top U.S., European Banks Got $50 Billion in AIG Aid (Pd. subs. req'd). The beneficiaries of the government's bailout of American International Group Inc. include at least two dozen U.S. and foreign financial institutions that have been paid roughly $50 billion since the Federal Reserve first extended aid to the insurance giant. Among those institutions are Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Germany's Deutsche Bank AG, each of which received roughly $6 billion in payments between mid-September and December 2008, according to a confidential document and people familiar with the matter. The story includes a chart that also lists Merrill, Wachovia, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley as well as a variety of Euro banks as beneficiaries of the AIG bailout. Our new Bailout Briefing has more on AIG.
