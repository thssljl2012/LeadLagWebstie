From today's FT:Bank of America's request for $20bn of government money to prop up its acquisition of Merrill Lynch was a "tactical mistake" that made the bank appear as weak as Citigroup, Ken Lewis, BofA's chief executive, told the Financial Times yesterday.If that's the way you feel, then give the money back.  In this market, it would be a supreme show of strength. Mr Lewis said he would stay on as chief until it paid back the $45bn of government money it received under the bank recapitalisation programme, possibly within two to three years - the first time he has signalled plans to leave the company.In the real world, if he borrowed it, and he can't pay it back immediately then, well, he needed it.  I don't really care how he wants to dress it up.  It wasn't a tactical mistake to take the cash, it was the only play he had at the time to keep his business in business.  To say you will "possibly" pay it back in two or three years is to say nothing at all about when you are going to pay it back and speaks directly to your need.However, he expressed regret that an "abundance of caution" had led him to take more aid than he said was necessary to absorb Merrill's $15bn fourth-quarter loss.BofA received an initial $25bn from the US Treasury in September. It requested a further $20bn at the end of December as the scale of Merrill's losses eclipsed initial forecasts. "In hindsight, it was a tactical mistake because it put us in the same category as Citigroup," said Mr Lewis. He said that it would have been better to request only $10bn, which could have helped curtail investor fears that further problems were in the offing.Oh, now I see.  You didn't need the entire $45 billion, all you really needed was $35 billion.  That's much better, I understand now why you are so upset that your company is being lumped together with Citi. Jackass.
