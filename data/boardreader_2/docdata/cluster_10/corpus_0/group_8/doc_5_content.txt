LONDON (Reuters)  U.S. Bank Merrill Lynch has suspended a currency trader in its London office after he ran up suspected losses of more than $400 million, the Financial Times reported.  Quoting people familiar with the situation, the newspapers Saturday edition said the trader has been suspended after trades on Norwegian and Swedish currencies went wrong.   The losses, if confirmed, will cause more financial headaches for Bank of America, the vast banking and investment house that bought Merrill Lynch last September.  In a statement issued earlier on Friday, Merrill said it was investigating an irregularity in its London trading positions.   Senior managers of the business are focused on the issue and believe the risks surrounding possible losses are under control, the company said in a statement.   The sum involved pales in comparison to the 4.9 billion Euros lost by Societe Generale trader Jerome Kerviel in 2007 and the $1.4 billion that Barings trader Nick Leeson lost in 1995, an amount that sunk his bank.
