Determined not to cede an inch to New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) filed court documents Thursday saying that disclosing the identities of the Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. employees who received $3.6 billion in bonus money would do "grave and irreparable harm."BofA is fighting off the New York AG's attempt to force former Merrill CEO John Thain to divulge the recipient's names in an investigation into the bonus money paid out right before the merger between the two banks closed.  According to Bloomberg the filing claims:    The information Cuomo seeks would provide a "road map" revealing which business lines the banks believe to be most valuable and enable competitors to poach the bank's top talent, Bank of America argued in the court filing. Disclosure of the information would also cause "internal dissension and consternation," pose security risks for the exposed bankers and their families, and cause employees to leave.   The bonus issue has haunted Thain and BofA's CEO Ken Lewis for more than two months, as the politicians have sharply criticized the payments ahead of Merrill announcing a fourth-quarter loss of $15 billion. Cuomo quickly launched a high-profile investigation into the bonuses and the merger itself. The issue was also listed as one of the reasons that activist investor CtW Investment Group began calling for Lewis' to step down as CEO Thursday. - George White    See Bloomberg story  See Dealscape story about CtW/Lewis
