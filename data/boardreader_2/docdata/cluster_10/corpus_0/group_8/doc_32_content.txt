 We asked our members what questions they'd ask the Wall Street bankers if they were sitting on a House or Senate panel investigating the bailout. Most of your questions fall into five categories. You want Wall Street bankers to:  justify why they shouldn't be charged with a crime,  defend their huge bonuses,  explain their unfair fees,  tell us where the money went, and  let us know if the failing economy is forcing them to face the same hard choices we're facing. You can vote on which of the five best questions you like the most here.   Meanwhile, today's Wall Street Journal (pd. subs. req'd) has a page 1 story by Susanne Craig called Merrill's $10 Million Men: Top 10 Earners Made $209 Million in 2008 as Firm Foundered. Excerpt: While Merrill staggered, 11 top executives were paid more than $10 million in cash and stock last year, say people familiar with the situation. An additional 149 received $3 million or more. The stock awards, which accounted for much of the compensation, have fallen sharply in value since they were made last year. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has subpoenaed information about Merrill's highest-paid employees in connection with his probe into $3.6 billion in bonuses paid by Merrill in the days before it was taken over by Bank of America Corp. Thus far, Bank of America hasn't turned over the names of Merrill's highest-paid executives, claiming it would help rivals woo its top talent.
