Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s CEO is now calling his request for $20 billion in government money to support the acquisition of Merrill Lynch a &#8220;tactical mistake.&#8221; The AP Well no shit, Kenny. You made a deal with the devil. Did you really think you wouldn&#8217;t get burned? Ken Lewis also said he would stay on as CEO until the bank pays back all of its $45 billion in government funding &#8212; which could take two or three years. I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s the news a lot of people wanted to hear. The Board should force him out. Charlotte&#8217;s economic future is at stake.
