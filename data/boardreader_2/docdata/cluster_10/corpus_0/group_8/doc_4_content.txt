From the CTW Investment Group website:CtW Investment Group Calls On Bank Of America Board To Remove Lewis Or Face Ouster VoteFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEThursday, March 5, 2009CONTACT: Rich Clayton, 202-255-6433WASHINGTON, D.C. -- In a letter to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Lead Director O. Temple Sloan, the CtW Investment Group called on BAC's board to remove Ken Lewis as Chairman and CEO in light of his disastrous missteps. Since the September 15, 2008 announcement of the merger with Merrill Lynch, BAC has:Suffered a 90% drop in share priceAllowed Merrill to pay out $3.6 billion in bonuses, even as the firm was hemorrhaging moneyDenied any active role in determining the size of Merrill bonuses, a claim subsequently contradicted by documents that have emerged in the NY Attorney Generals investigationFailed to timely disclose over $20 billion in pre-tax losses at MerrillFailed to invoke the Material Adverse Effects clause of the merger agreement to protect BAC shareholders from these lossesRemoving Mr. Lewis is now a necessary prerequisite to restoring BACs credibility with shareholders, regulators and the public. If the board refuses to remove Mr. Lewis, CtW will call on shareholders at Bank of Americas Annual Meeting in April to vote against the re-election of Mr. Lewis, Lead Director Sloan and Corporate Governance Committee Chairman Thomas Ryan.
