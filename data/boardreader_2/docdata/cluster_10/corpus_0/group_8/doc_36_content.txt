CHARLOTTE, NC., Mar. 6 (TOTI) --  A group of disgruntled investors is calling for the head of Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis.  Lewis has been at the helm of Bank of America while the company engineered the takeovers of both Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, a $45 billion TARP bailout package, 35,000 layoffs, and a $28 billion quarterly loss.  The Change To Win Investment Group holds 1% of the total BAC stock available.  The group is particularly unhappy about Lewis' decision to go forward with the Merrill Lynch purchase despite them sending him a letter in which they clearly outlined their opposition.    The investor group warned Bank of America's board that if they don't remove Lewis, it will petition shareholders to vote against him being re-elected this year at Bank of America's annual meeting on  April 29.
