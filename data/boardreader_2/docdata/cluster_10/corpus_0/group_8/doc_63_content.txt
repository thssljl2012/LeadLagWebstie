That's right, the bitch is flaming mad (you can tell by the use of the word "stymie"), and not gonna take it anymore.  New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo urged a state judge on Friday to reject Bank of America Corp's (BAC.N) attempt to keep confidential a wide range of testimony about $3.6 billion of bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co employees.  Bank of America wants to expand a confidentiality order on testimony by former Merrill Chief Executive John Thain to cover all witnesses who testify under subpoena in the bonus probe, Cuomo said in a Friday letter to Justice Bernard Fried of the state supreme court in Manhattan.  Cuomo said the bank's request was part of its "continued efforts to stymie" the probe, and should be rejected.  Cuomo asks court to deny Bank of America request [Reuters]
