NY Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has won a legal battle to be able to publicly name employees at Merril Lynch who were given large bonuses last December. Cuomo thinks this means he will also win the battle to release the names of people from AIG. Some of the information is coming out now and it&#8217;s pretty amazing, at Merril Lynch: The four executives who got the most received a total of $121 million, according to Cuomo. The next four got $62 million, and the following six were awarded $66 million. A grand total of 696 Merrill employees received at least $1 million each in bonuses. Compare this to the $165 million that AIG officials received in bonuses. This is made even more amazing considering: Merrill accelerated its normal bonus schedule so the awards took place just days before Bank of America acquired the company at the end of 2008. A couple of weeks later, executives suddenly discovered Merrill was bleeding to the tune of $13.8 billion during the final quarter of the year. The US then gave Bank of America $20 billion to help them with the mess that was Merril Lynch.
