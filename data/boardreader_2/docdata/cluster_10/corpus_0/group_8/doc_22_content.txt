Bank of Americas request for $20bn of government money to prop up its acquisition of Merrill Lynch was a tactical mistake that made the bank appear as weak as Citigroup, Ken Lewis, BofAs chief executive told the Financial Times on Monday. Mr Lewis vowed to stay on as chief executive of the North Carolina-based bank until it paid back the $45bn of government money it received under the US Treasurys bank recapitalisation programme, possibly within two to three years. This is the first time he has signalled his plans to leave the company. If Ken Lewis thinks taking $20 billion of government money was a mistake, we, the American people, will be more than happy to take our money back. Copyright &copy; 2009 Kooks In Suits.
