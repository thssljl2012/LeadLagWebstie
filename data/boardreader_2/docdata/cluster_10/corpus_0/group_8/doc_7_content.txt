  Merrill Lynch probes $400m trader lossBy Adrian Cox and Peter Garnham                     Go To OriginalA Merrill Lynch currency trader has been suspended after racking up more than $400m in undisclosed losses in recent months, raising further questions about the financial health of the investment bank bought by Bank of America  last September.Merrill is poring over the books of Alexis Stenfors, a London currency trader, who was suspended after Norwegian and Swedish currency trades went wrong, according to people familiar with the situation. Merrill is in talks with UK regulators after uncovering what it called a trading irregularity in London.The trading losses are another blow to the once mighty Wall Street firm that made a $27.6bn overall loss last year and was forced to sell to Bank of America to avoid bankruptcy.During a recent evaluation of certain positions, we discovered an irregularity, the bank said in a statement on Friday without giving details.We informed regulators immediately and are working closely with authorities to thoroughly investigate the matter.It added: Senior managers of the business are focused on the issue and believe the risks surrounding possible losses are under control.The New York Times reported the investigation on Friday and said that Mr Stenfors had reported a personal trading profit of $120m for 2008.Mr Stenfors could not be reached for comment and his lawyers office directed calls to Merrill. The New York Times said he had told the newspaper the matter was a misunderstanding and that his lawyer had said he was co-operating with the investigation.The trading loss of $400m would cut into, but not erase, the profits of Merrills rates and currency operations, headed by David Gu, in London. Mr Gus operations are believed to have generated several billion dollars in profits last year.Details of the loss emerged as Andrew Cuomo, New York attorney-general, accused BofA of interfering with his investigation into the payment of bonuses at Merrill Lynch in December, according to a court filing.In the filing, Mr Cuomo said BofA was refusing to comply with a subpoena requiring the bank to provide him with a list of the Merrill employees who received multi-million dollar bonuses in December.
