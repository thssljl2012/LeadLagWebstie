Once again, Bank of America proves that it is out of touch with the country. In it&#8217;s petition filed late Wednesday, Bank of America&#8217;s attorneys urged Justice Bernard Fried to reject New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo&#8217;s demand for data relating to bonuses it gave shortly after its merger with Merrill. It&#8217;s petition stems on their belief that release of the &#8220;sensative&#8221; information would cause them, as CNBC reports, &#8220;&#8221;grave harm&#8221; if it is forced to reveal data about an estimated $3.6 billion of bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch officials.&#8221; Further reporting by Bloomberg reveals a paranoid reaction by Bank of America over the Attorney General&#8217;s requests. &#8220;The information Cuomo seeks would provide a road map revealing which business lines the banks believe to be most valuable and enable competitors to poach the banks top talent&#8221; Once again,a bankpulls a C.Y.A. Let&#8217;s be clear people. These banks have no interest in aiding in the recovery of the nations people, only in mainitaing it&#8217;s ill-gotten bottom line. The country is going to financial hell, without even a pot to relieve itself in, and we&#8217;re still rangling over whether or not a bailed out bank should be compelled to release data?! Well, in the words of Jack Nicholson&#8217;s Joker, &#8220;This town needs an enima&#8221;! And, might I suggest we start with Bank of America!
