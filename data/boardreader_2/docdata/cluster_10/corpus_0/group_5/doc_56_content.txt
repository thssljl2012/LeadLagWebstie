This prediction comes to us from John Train. Who is he? Let&amp;#8217;s just say that he has over 50 years experience in Wall Street investments&amp;#8230;.. &amp;#8230;..I presume that although we are in a severe recession it will not decompose into a full-scale depression, because that is what everyone is afraid of and desperate to avoid. Wall Street likes to say that the market has anticipated five of the last three recessions - the point being that a market crash frightens the authorities into taking necessary action&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230; Investment opportunity is the difference between the reality and the perception. And since many equities are priced as though a depression might be on the way, many of them are attractively priced&amp;#8230;&amp;#8230;. And when should you buy? In or near what I call the Time of Deepest Gloom, if you can spot it. 8 really, really scary predictions - John Train (6) - FORTUNE. So what&amp;#8217;s John saying? A copule of things:  We aren&amp;#8217;t going to get to a full blown depression. The government&amp;#8217;s activities, while not exactly making things rosy at least will keep us from being in big trouble. Many stock prices are assuming a depression and that makes some companies a &amp;#8220;value.&amp;#8221; The time of deepest gloom is when to buy stocks. When is that? Hard to say because so far, things haven&amp;#8217;t started improving yet.  Next time, we&amp;#8217;ll be looking at Meredith Whitney who is the analyst at Oppen heimer who is predicting the demise of Citibank. Stay tuned!
