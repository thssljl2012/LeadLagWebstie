Yay. Against odds and expectations, JP Morgan earned money last quarter. Sure, only 7 cents a share, or $702 million. But that was more than expected by analysts, who had forecast the big banking company to break even.   The bad news is that Merrill Lynch's losses for the quarter are so big that Bank of America needs more bailout money to complete the deal. So the financial bloodbath isn't over. Before the real economy can recover, the financial economy needs to stop cratering. The Merrill Lynch damage shows that hasn't happened. And it probably won't happen until home prices stop falling. Predictions of the restarting of economic growth in the second half of 2009 are looking very optimistic -- and unrealistic.
