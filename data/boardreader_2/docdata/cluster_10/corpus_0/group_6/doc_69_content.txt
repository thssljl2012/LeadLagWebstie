Consider this morning&#8217;s activity as an example of selling the rumor and buying the news, as shares of both Citigroup and Bank of America advanced smartly before the open after both reported poor earnings results amid the lousy global economy.  Shares of Citi were up 6.3% after the company reported a loss of $8.29 billion for the quarter, and said it would cut itself into two businesses, one known as Citicorp, and the other as Citi Holdings, made up of asset management and consumer finance.  Meanwhile, Bank of America shares were higher by 7.6% after it reported a loss for the fourth quarter and nailed down details of a deal with the U.S. Treasury for $20 billion in capital in order to help digest losses at Merrill Lynch, which it acquired at the beginning of the year. The Merrill losses came to $15.31 billion, making it clear why B of A needs the additional capital (though one could argue such a merger probably could have been put off, or something, but never mind that now.)  &#8220;The predilection being shown by the US government to continue to put up the cash and guarantees required to support the too-big-to-fail players is being lapped up by the markets,&#8221; writes Martin Slaney, head of derivatives at GFT in London. &#8220;Despite the worse than expected numbers US stock markets are still expected to open up around 1 per cent, focusing on the bigger-picture ramifications of the funding lifeline.&#8221;
