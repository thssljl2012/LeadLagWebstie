                The talk has not yet begun, but I think this week we could witness the firing of Merrill Lynch head John Thain (and for sure his hopes of succeeding Lewis are out the window) and possibly, although not as certain, that of Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis.I sure do hate what the troubles of Wachovia and Bank of America are doing to the Queen City, Charlotte, North Carolina.
