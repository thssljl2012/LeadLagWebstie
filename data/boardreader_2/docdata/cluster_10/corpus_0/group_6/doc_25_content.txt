It&#8217;s the same old story. Banks need money. Futures are lower in the U.S. with the focus, once again, on the banking industry. Citigroup is readying a break-up of its mammoth financial supermarket model, Deutsche Bank warned of an unexpected loss of about 4.8 billion ($6.3 billion), and HSBC Holdings fell on concerns about capital needs.  Headed into the open, most of the major financial institutions are suggesting a decline, with shares Citigroup down 15%, declining 89 cents to $5.01 a share, after the company officially announced a joint venture agreement with Morgan Stanley for sharing the firm&#8217;s brokerage forces. Morgan Stanley has the option to acquire additional parts of the brokerage over the next few years, leading David Trone, analyst at Fox, Pitt-Kelton to say the deal &#8220;as more a sale of Smith Barney, albeit one that is delayed/staggered.&#8221;  HSBC was down 9.3% after a Morgan Stanley note suggested that HSBC needs another $20 billion to $30 billion in capital. &#8220;We estimate HSBC will have injected $11 billion of equity into its subsidiaries in 2008, leaving surplus capital at the top historically low at a time when the bank would surely prefer to have a bigger buffer,&#8221; they wrote, also adding that the company needs additional funds for certain capital reserves. Deutsche Bank shares lost 9.6% following its announcement. Other large names, such as Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase, were not immune, falling 3.8% and 4.1%.
