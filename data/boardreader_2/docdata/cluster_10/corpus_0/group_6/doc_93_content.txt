Photo Credit: Unknown via Wikipedia; North Atlantic Ocean taken from Surfside Beach, SC on August 9th 2007.On both sides of the Atlantic the markets continue to punish mismanagement teams left and right and banks are flushed into the Atlantic.Citigroup announced a fourth-quarter loss of $8.3 Billion (Citigroup loses $8.3 billion, to split in two; Reuters) and decided to rip the company in pieces and hope that someone will throw money their way. Morgan Stanley was the first to bite the bait (Citigroup - Morgan Stanley Combo; The Path to the Pegasus Letter).Bank of America reported a loss of $1.79 Billion during the fourth-quarter (Bank of America posts first loss in 17 years; Reuters) due to their genius move to snap up worthless Merrill Lynch which said thank you with a $15.31 Billion fourth-quarter loss.Bank of America just received another $20 Billion bailout (Bank of America in need of  more cash; The Path to the Pegasus Letter). The above two are just two examples out of several thousand.The situation is the same in the UK where banks on Sunday where first lured by another offer (UK: banks to get more cash if they pass it on; AP). The government offered banks more tax payers money if they will give it back to taxpayers in the form of loans.In other words the government will take tax revenues and wants to recycle it through banks who need to promise they would give it back to taxpayers. Awesome and so much better then to either cut taxes so taxpayers don't have to pay as much and are able to keep more of their income or just write a check back to taxpayers and avoid the banks.On the other side most UK banks are either semi-nationalized or entirely nationalized which makes the offer ridiculous since the government will simply move taxpayers money from the Treasury into their banks. Regardless on Monday a second bank bailout package was sank into the North Sea (Britain announces 2nd banking rescue plan; AP).Posted by Apollo on January 21st 2009.
