Ahh, sweet revenge. Wachovia accepted a takeover offer from Citigroup in the fall, only to jilt the New York financial conglomerate suddenly in favor of a $12.7 billion offer from Wells Fargo. The split wasn&#8217;t amicable. Now Citigroup has the chance for a measure of revenge served in the cold of winter, as its deal with Morgan Stanley will give it the heft to outpace Wachovia in one of Wachovia&#8217;s crown-jewel businesses: retail brokerage, or the business of catering to the average investor. The business is a point of pride for Wachovia. When the North Carolina bank was on the rocks last summer, one thing it didn&#8217;t want to do was sell its retail brokerage business. A Wachovia spokeswoman bristled at the suggestion last summer, telling Bloomberg, Wachovia is firmly committed to our retail brokerage strategy and has no plans to sell it&#8230;[it] has been and continues to be one of Wachovia Corp.&#8217;s best-performing businesses. It is a core business for Wachovia and integral to our long-term strategy.&#8221; Wachovia wouldn&#8217;t even sell its retail brokerage to Citigroup when the two banks negotiated that ill-fated deal in the fall. Citigroup had to settle for buying Wachovia&#8217;s private bank, which it hoped would boost Citigroup&#8217;s Smith Barney arm in the highly coveted business of advising rich investors. The private bank serves people and families with several million dollars of investable assets.  If Citigroup can make its deal with Morgan Stanley work, the payoff could be sweet. The combination of Citigroup&#8217;s Smith Barney brokerage with Morgan Stanley&#8217;s broker network has created what is&#8211;for now at least&#8211;the largest retail brokerage force in the U.S., with nearly 20,400 financial advisers in 1,000 branches. Citigroup&#8217;s joint venture dwarfs Wachovia&#8217;s brokerage network, which has about 15,000 brokers and 693 offices. Before the deal, Smith Barney had just 11,000 brokers. (Bank of America&#8217;s acquisition of Merrill Lynch creates a Thundering Herd of 20,000 brokers, just a few hundred behind Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.) That is no small cut. Wachovia spent years and billions of dollars building up its brokerage. In 2003 it embarked on a joint venture with Prudential Financial that added over 4,300 brokers, boosting the brokerage ranks to 12,000. In 2008 Wachovia paid nearly $7 billion to acquire the brokerage of A.G. Edwards and its 6,600 brokers. Over the years, of course, some brokers left despite Wachovia&#8217;s generous retention packages, leaving Wachovia with about 15,000.  Of course, Citigroup probably had its eyes on Bank of America Merrill Lynch in moving toward the Morgan Stanley joint venture. Still, it couldn&#8217;t have hurt that it leaps over Wachovia in the process. Wachovia has shown little regret about jilting Citigroup. But now Citigroup has clearly said, as Willy Loman did, that attention must be paid.
