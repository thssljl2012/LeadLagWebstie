Morgan Stanley and Citigroup&amp;#8217;s Smith Barney. Will those crazy kids ever make it work?  Executives of the two firms held two conference calls to describe their strategy for staying together. Deal Journal followed boht. Our hosts are supposed to be James Gorman, Co-President of Morgan Stanley, and Ned Kelly, Head of Global Banking at Citi. You can also check out Deal Journal&amp;#8217;s analysis earlier today of what Morgan Stanley Smith Barney can learn from Wachovia&amp;#8217;s joint venture with Prudential Financial.  Highlights of the Investor Call Terms of the Deal Analyst David Trone of Fox-Pitt Kelton: &amp;#8220;the gross value of the deal looks like $13 billion.&amp;#8221; Gorman: It will be operated as a joint venture. Morgan Stanley will own 51% of the venture, and Citigroup will own 49%. In addition, in consideration of moving Morgan Stanley&amp;#8217;s contribution to a majority shareholding of 51%, Morgan Stanley will pay Citigroup $2.7 billion in cash, and Morgan Stanley will have a majority representation on the Board of Directors of the venture. The joint venture will not include, will not include Citi&amp;#8217;s private bank here or internationally or Nikko Cordial Securities. This deal gives Morgan Stanley the opportunity to increase its share over time and Citigroup the opportunity to realize further value in the outgoing years. The sale of future tranches, if any, will be transacted at fair market value. Morgan Stanley will exchange its Global Wealth Management business platform, which includes our core retail, private wealth management and international private wealth management, into the joint venture. Citigroup, in turn, will exchange United States Smith Barney operations, Quilter in the United Kingdom and Smith Barney Australia for its share of the venture. Ned Kelly: &amp;#8220;After the third anniversary, Morgan Stanley has an option to acquire an additional 14%, after the fourth anniversary, the option to acquire an additional 15%, and after the fifth anniversary, they can acquire the balance. If they get to that point &amp;#8212; in other words, if they get to 80% within a year of that, we would have the option to put the balance to Morgan Stanley.&amp;#8221; Corbat: &amp;#8220;Citi will also recognize a pretax gain of approximately $9.5 billion&amp;#8230; Tier 1 capital roughly $6.4 billion.&amp;#8221; (Morgan Stanley&amp;#8217;s Tier 1 capital, which is the capital base that regulators look at, will drop by 1%). Expected closing is second half of the year. There will be the creation of a new broker-dealer &amp;#8211;Morgan Stanley Smith Barney is the official name &amp;#8212; in which both entities will be contributing. There is no break-up fee or penalty if one of the parties pulls out of the deal, according to Corbat. Size The combined firm&amp;#8217;s estimated pro forma net revenues were slightly under $15 billion at $14.9 billion. Total number of financial advisors are approximately 20,390 or 20,400. 1000 brokerage locations nationally. Headquarters remain in New York.  Keep in mind, however, that the prediction of $1.1 billion in cost savings over the next 18 months &amp;#8212; and estimated overlap at 6.8 million households &amp;#8212; would likely include some broker layoffs. Gorman does not expect client overlap to be a big issue, however, because few clients maintain a relationship with more than one broker.  Why Citigroup Chose This Deal  Glenn Schorr of UBS noted to Citigroup executives, &amp;#8220;On the strategy side, it&amp;#8217;s not what people would have expected, meaning this is one of your theoretically better businesses, lower capital intensive businesses with good long-term solid growth. Why the change? Why the JV structure at this point on one of your better cash flowing, low capital intensive businesses with a call to somebody else?&amp;#8221;  The answer: &amp;#8220;The calls are structured so that effectively they are options, not obligations. As I think you are aware, they are basically three to five years out. So we are going to be a very substantial participant in this venture for at least the next three years, if not beyond. During that period, we obviously get our share of the earnings.&amp;#8221; Translation: Citigroup sold its part of the business in hope of greater earnings for at least the next three years - and if Morgan Stanley increases its portion, Citigroup makes money because MS will have to pay the full market value of the stake to Citi.  Ned Kelly: &amp;#8220;the whole, by its terms, was not for sale&amp;#8230;.So when we thought about it, just in terms of enhancing value going forward, creating an industry-leading competitor and being able to get out..at some point, assuming that that&amp;#8217;s how it&amp;#8217;s resolved, several years, three to five years down the road, it made an awful lot of sense to us to sell the business at this age, where we believe we can contribute to enhanced value over time.&amp;#8221;  Live-Blogging the Call With Reporters 5:45 p.m.: Putative start to the call. But the investor call is running late, so we are informed to wait until 6 p.m. Mozart symphonies keep us company.  6:02: Conference will begin momentarily. Mozart rejoins us. 6:05: The operator makes the necessary introductions. First to speak is Morgan Stanley&amp;#8217;s PR maven, Jeanmarie McFadden, with Mike Corbat, head of Citi&amp;#8217;s wealth management business, and Gorman.  6:07: Reuters asks whether the joint venture will sell products from both Morgan Stanley and Citigroup. Yes, says Gorman. Now, what do the executives have to say about the speculation that this was an &amp;#8220;activist&amp;#8221; move by the U.S. government to push Citi to sell assets? Corbat bristles: &amp;#8220;there was no government pressure for this transaction.&amp;#8221; Gorman adds, &amp;#8220;and not from outside either.&amp;#8221; Funding of the joint venture: $55 billion from Smith Barney and $35 billion from Morgan Stanley side. Profits will be shared pro rata, according to their ownership, which is 49% Citigroup and 51% Morgan Stanley. Gorman says it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;way too early&amp;#8221; to discuss layoffs. &amp;#8220;This is a growth story. We believe this is a business that will take market share.&amp;#8221; The fee structure for clients is yet to be decided.  6:10: Bloomberg is up. Equity research will not be part of the joint venture, although the brokers will have access to both firms&amp;#8217; research. Broker payouts are similar at both firms. Gorman: &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re not doing this to change the payout structure to the detriment of the advisers.&amp;#8221; Corbat says talks started to engage a number of weeks ago and stepped up the last month. Gorman: &amp;#8220;John and Vikram decided to put our heads together and figure this out. We all know each other, which is one of the nice things about this.&amp;#8221; It is true that all the &amp;#8220;Morgan Stanley South&amp;#8221; jokes about Citi are now declared null and void by obviousness. 6:12: Is Citi too big to manage? Corbat dances around the question slightly by saying that Citi is only contributing part of its business and believes that what it is putting in will grow in terms of value, near-term earnings and valuation over time. Corbat: &amp;#8220;We will continue to run our private banks in the U.S. and internationally as well as Nikko and have our bank-branched advisors.&amp;#8221; That last part means that advisers within Citibank branches will remain there and not be part of this transaction. Translation of Corbat&amp;#8217;s speech: Citi isn&amp;#8217;t too big to manage; it just wants to make money like any red-blooded American bank. 6:14:  Four board members from Morgan Stanley, two from Citi.  6:15: Why didn&amp;#8217;t Citi shop it around? Because it didn&amp;#8217;t want to give away the whole business. Corbat: &amp;#8220;Being something that we wanted to do that way, there were limited partners.&amp;#8221; Once they took into account size, culture, and other issues, it really looked like Morgan Stanley was the one. 6:18: Gorman: &amp;#8220;Most financial advisers are hoping to serve client who have $1 million in investable assets,&amp;#8221; but he points out that smaller clients will survive. &amp;#8220;These are very similar organizations in terms of the quality of financial advisers,&amp;#8221; he adds. The deal includes legacy Morgan Stanley brokers as well as Dean Witter group. In fact, Gorman says that Morgan Stanley has grown its group of &amp;#8220;legacy&amp;#8221; advisers by 30%. Gorman: &amp;#8220;To characterize the business as the legacy Dean Witter business is not reflective of where that business is now.&amp;#8221; He declines to comment on their big rival, BofA-Merrill. &amp;#8220;What our competitors do away from us, we can&amp;#8217;t control, so we&amp;#8217;re not going to focus on it.&amp;#8221; 6:20: How will client referrals work? Corbat says they have to work with it. There will be no revenue sharing between Citibank banking services and the joint venture.  6:23: Morgan Stanley just sold the Quilter business; now it&amp;#8217;s buying it back because Quilter is part of Citi. Gorman: &amp;#8220;Life has some funny twists.&amp;#8221; 6:24: Estimate of cost of retention bonuses? Corbat: &amp;#8220;We will put a plan in place and have yet to finalize that.&amp;#8221; 6:25: Gorman says the two firms didn&amp;#8217;t do the deal based on current banking trends: &amp;#8220;If you defined strategy based on the near future, you wouldn&amp;#8217;t build 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 people organizations. These things come back. People don&amp;#8217;t stop investing over the long haul.&amp;#8221; 6:26: The call ends.
