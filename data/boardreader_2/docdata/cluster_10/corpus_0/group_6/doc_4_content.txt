From the Associated Press -     Eighty-three of the nation's 100 largest corporations, including Citigroup, Bank of America and News Corp., had subsidiaries in offshore tax havens in 2007, and some of the companies received federal bailout funding, a government watchdog said Friday.    The Government Accountability Office released a report that said Bank of America Inc., Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley all had more than 100 units in countries that maintain low or no taxes. The three financial institutions were included in the $700 billion financial bailout approved by Congress.    Insurance giant American International Group Inc., which has received about $150 billion in bailout money, had 18 subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. had 50 units and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. had 18; both financial institutions received government bailout money.    Separately, the GAO said 63 of the 100 largest federal contractors maintain subsidiaries in 50 tax havens.
