  Former Merrill Lynch CEO and connoisseur of finely decorated offices John Thain obeyed a judge's order that he spill the beans on Merrill's $3.6 billion in bonuses. See, Thain claimed he wasn't allowed to discuss the extravagant bonuses&#8212;which came right before Merrill announced a $15 billion 4th quarter loss&#8212;which pissed off Cuomo, who then filed a motion to force Thain to speak up.  The Daily News reports, "Dodging a press gauntlet, Thain slipped into the lower Manhattan tower that houses Cuomo's offices through a subway entrance."  But Thain still left through a back entrance, which was perfect opportunity for some photo ops.  Thain's former bosses at Bank of America (which took over Merrill) were also subpoenaed by Cuomo.
