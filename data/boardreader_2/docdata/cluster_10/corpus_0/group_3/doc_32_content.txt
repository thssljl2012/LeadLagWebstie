 Finally there is a decent and principledman amongst the CEOs,Robert Willumstad. Mr Willumstadformer chief executive officer of insurance giant AIG, which the U.S. government took an approximately 80% stake in after giving it an emergency $85 billion loan, was dismissed last week after only about three months on the job.  Willumstad has reportedly told his successor that he has decided not to accept his $22 million severance package, which he is entitled,since AIG shareholders and employees had lost so much money as a result of its meltdown.  BUT then there is this story:  The chief executive of the failed savings and loan Washington Mutual could get US$13.65 million for the 18 days he was on the job, a regulatory filing shows. Alan Fishman was awarded a US$7.5 million signing bonus when he joined the Seattle-based thrift on Sept 7, according to a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing. His employment agreement also provided for a US$6.15 million lump sum payment as severance if he were terminated without cause, the filing shows.  With such &amp;quot;golden parachutes&amp;quot; are CEO's really motivated to save their companies, it appears to me that it is more rewarding for these CEOs to let the companies fail and they have will lots of money without the worries and stress of managing a company.
