Here:  After the House of Representatives rejected a rescue for the financial industry Monday, fears grew that more banks, particularly small and midsize lenders, could run into trouble unless a new plan emerged quickly.  Even shares in the three banks that have survived the crisis as the largest in the industry -- Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup -- fell more than 10 percent Monday as anxiety gripped markets. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which transformed into bank holding companies last week, fell more than 12 percent.  Regional banks were punished even more severely as investors scrambled to figure out which of them might fall next in the absence of a bailout plan. National City Corporation, Downey Financial Corporation and Sovereign Bancorp, lenders pressured by substantial exposure to soured mortgages, were especially hard-hit, falling 63 percent, 48 percent and 36 percent respectively on the heels of the government's seizure Thursday of Washington Mutual, the largest savings and loan.   "With the credit markets drying up and bank-to-bank lending rates through the roof, the ability of these banks to weather the storm is being called into question," said Jim Eckenrode, a banking analyst at TowerGroup, a financial services consulting firm.
