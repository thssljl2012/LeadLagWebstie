The Associated Press and U.S. News and World Report are reporting that former Lehman Brothers CEO Richard Fuld and U.S. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson had a dinner conversation in the Spring of this year&amp;#8230;and apparently&amp;#8230;Richard Fuld left the meeting thinking that Paulson had his Wall Street firm&amp;#8217;s back. In an email that was sent from Fuld to another &amp;#8220;higher-up&amp;#8221; in Lehman Brothers, it seems as though Hank Paulson wasn&amp;#8217;t too worried about Lehman&amp;#8217;s predicament, saying Lehman had a strong brand presence in the world&amp;#8217;s financial circles and that things just needed to be tidied up a bit&amp;#8230;which would come as a result of Hedge Fund regulation and the G7 embracing certain reforms yet to be determined. CLICK HERE TO VIEW A COPY OF THE EMAIL SENT FROM LEHMAN BROTHERS&amp;#8217; CEO RICHARD FULD TO A FELLOW EMPLOYEE AT LEHMAN REGARDING HIS MEETING WITH HANK PAULSON&amp;#8230; Richard Fuld really believed the Treasury Secretary (who was the CEO of Goldman Sachs) was going to look after a fellow Wall Street investment bank and that his company didn&amp;#8217;t have to get too worried about any bad developments that might arise in the coming months.

Because while Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch all received some form of aid and a &amp;#8220;heads up&amp;#8221; from the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Lehman Brothers was left to fend for itself, without any hope of a federal bailout. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson needs to answer a few questions&amp;#8230;immediately. Why AIG and not Lehman Brothers? Why Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and not Lehman Brothers? Those questions might be answered by Paulson by saying something to the extent that Fannie and Freddie were too heavily tied to the mortgage crisis and that AIG held too many insurance products that were tied to all of the subprime/junk mortgage paper that was floating around in the financial markets; in other words, these three entities had way too much involvement in the current crisis and they had to be propped up in order to maintain some semblance of stability in the markets. But why were Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley allowed to become &amp;#8220;bank holding companies&amp;#8221; and participate in the federal bailout&amp;#8230;while Lehman wasn&amp;#8217;t given the same opportunity? Are the Lehman shareholders less important than those of Goldman and Morgan Stanley? What about Merrill Lynch&amp;#8217;s sweetheart bailout by Bank of America (which was aided by the Fed and Treasury)? I realize that Hank Paulson has a ton on his plate right now&amp;#8230;but the American public is still waiting for its answers.
