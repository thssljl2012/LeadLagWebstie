  This is scary. AIG is getting a $37.8B loan of our money. Insurance companies recover losses through investments. Some call them the original hedge fund. Now that investing has become the 21st circle of Dante's Inferno (there's only nine), how could this company be made to become a giant cash reserve by making them liquify their assets? If they sell any stock, nobody's going to buy it. At least, not a long term investor. If one of its customers has a major league loss, that would be really bad. I think that would be a good idea; drop their biggest customers one by one, as soon as possible. It doesn't make any sense to hold that much risk after investing has become the biggest risk of all. Although losses add up, small losses are just that; small. Tags: bailout, credit, crisis, aig
