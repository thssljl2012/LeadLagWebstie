Filed under: Lehman Br Holdings (LEH), Housing, Financial Crisis Oh how the mighty have fallen. With Lehman Bros. in the midst of winding up what&amp;#8217;s left of its operations following its bankruptcy filing, chairman and CEO Richard Fuld has been kicked out of the corner office at Lehman&amp;#8217;s Manhattan headquarters &amp;#8212; and sent packing to to a 41st floor office at 1271 6th Avenue. Lehman&amp;#8217;s building at 745 7th Avenue is now the headquarters for Barclays&amp;#8217; investment banking operations. It has no use for Mr. Fuld. With a flair for drama, The Wall Street Journal sums it up (subscription required) this way: &amp;#8220;Napoleon cooled his heels on Elba. The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala, India. And Lehman Brothers Holdings Chairman and CEO Richard Fuld Jr. will be banished to 1271 Sixth Ave.&amp;#8221; Meanwhile former CFO Erin Callan &amp;#8212; who was pushed out as a sacrificial lamb back in July &amp;#8212; gave her first post-Lehman interview to Fortune, telling the reporter that Mr. Fuld had been brought to tears by the difficulties the company was facing. If you&amp;#8217;re in the market for $15 million worth of Fuld&amp;#8217;s modern art collection, Christie&amp;#8217;s has got you covered.  Read Share This Share This
