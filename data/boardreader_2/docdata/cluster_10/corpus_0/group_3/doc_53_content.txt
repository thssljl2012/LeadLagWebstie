$10 Golden Parachute bonus to whoever did this for humanity: While former Lehman CEO Richard Fuld was testifying before the House Oversight Committee Oct. 6, CNBC reported he had been punched in the face at the Lehman Brothers gym after it was announced the firm was going bankrupt. CNBC and Vanity Fair contributor Vicki Ward said Fuld was attacked at the gym on a Sunday following the bankruptcy.  Frankly, I sat there and listened and Im with the guy who apparently, the day before Barclays announced they were coming in and Lehman had already filed for bankruptcy, went over to him in the gym and punched him because thats how I feel when I, you know, when I watched that, Ward said on the Oct. 6 Power Lunch. I didnt think he was contrite at all, I thought he was arrogant.  From two very senior sources  one incredibly senior source  that he went to the gym after  Lehman was announced as going under. He was on a treadmill with a heart monitor on. Someone was in the corner, pumping iron and he walked over and he knocked him out cold. And frankly after having watched this, Id have done the same too. Basically, someone knocked out the CEO of Lehman Brothers. Whoever you are, you are a true hero.
