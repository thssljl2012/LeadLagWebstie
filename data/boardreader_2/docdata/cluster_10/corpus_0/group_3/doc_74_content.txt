     Okay, so the banks world-wide have gotten trillions in cash over the last month or so, got to be good for liquidity, right?&amp;#0160; Not really, according to this article.&amp;#0160; The NYT piece makes it clear that banks are happy to have the cash thanks, but whilst the market is in meltdown, the money is going nowhere but in the reserves pot.&amp;#0160; &amp;quot;John A. Thain, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch, said on Thursday that banks were unlikely to act swiftly. Executives at other banks privately expressed a similar view. We will have the opportunity to redeploy that, Mr. Thain said of the new capital on a telephone call with analysts. But at least for the next quarter, its just going to be a cushion.&amp;quot;Well, that's money well spent then...&amp;#0160; For another view, check this out:I dont think that the market wants to see that capital being put to work to leverage the business up again, said Roger Freeman, an analyst at Barclays Capital, which acquired parts of the now-bankrupt Lehman Brothers last month. My expectation is its quarters off, not months off, before you see that capital being put to work.Remember folks, the market can stay irrational a lot longer than you can stay solvent.
