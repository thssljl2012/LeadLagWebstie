NEW YORK &amp;mdash; Citigroup agreed Monday to buy Wachovia's banking operations for $2.1 billion in a deal arranged by federal regulators, making the Charlotte-based bank the latest casualty of the widening global financial crisis.The deal greatly expands Citigroup's retail franchise, giving it a total of more than 4,300 U.S. branches and $600 billion in deposits,, and secures its place among the U.S. banking industry's Big Three, along with Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co.But it comes at a cost: Citigroup Inc. said it will slash its quarterly dividend in half to 16 cents. It also will dilute existing shareholders by selling $10 billion in common stock to shore up its capital position.In addition to assuming $53 billion worth of debt, Citigroup will absorb up to $42 billion of losses from Wachovia's $312 billion loan portfolio, with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. agreeing to cover any remaining losses. Citigroup also will issue $12 billion in preferred stock and warrants to the FDIC.
