And then there were four. Only four big home lenders are left standing amid more than a year of financial upheaval. They are Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup. A quick recap &amp;#8212; BofA bought the largest home lender in America, Countrywide; JP Morgan bought the operations of the largest savings and loan in America, Washington Mutual; and Citigroup is buying the operations of Wachovia, which previously got big on the West Coast by acquiring World Savings. Rod Thompson, head of lender First Guaranty Financial Corp. in Santa Ana, said when the crisis is over there will still be enough lenders to provide healthy competition and give consumers a variety of choices. He also sees an opportunity for solid regional banks, such as City National Bank and Union Bank of California, to grow.  City reported a 40% drop in earnings in Q2 to $36 million, and Union Bank reported a $141 million profit, down 15%. But they are still profitable, and that certainly beats losing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars on bad mortgages. Do you think Thompson is right?
