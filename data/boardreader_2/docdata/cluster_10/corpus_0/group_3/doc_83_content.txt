Before this credit crisis the future of the dollar as a world reserve currency seemed uncertain. For a moment there it appeared that the Euro was due to overtake the US $ as the new currency of oil and overall global reserve currency. Now with the credit crisis mess rearing its ugly head in Europe as well and the ensuing economic downturn it seems uncertain as to whether the Euro is in any better fundamental shape than the dollar.  I would argue that both currencies are due for a massive inflationary bout - especially the dollar. Thus this should push the value of gold relative to these two currencies much higher. The financial &amp;#8220;bailout&amp;#8221; plans put forth by many of the world&amp;#8217;s governments are certainly not good for their respective national currencies.  There is also increased demand from China, India, and other developing nations to take into account. Another thing to consider is central bank gold sales. As I&amp;#8217;m sure you&amp;#8217;re well aware of central banks attempt to &amp;#8220;manage&amp;#8221; the price of gold by using the massive gold reserves to drive price up or down. As a group the major central banks still have ample reserves but they are slowly running out of gold to sell and thus slowly but surely once the supply of central bank gold stops yet with demand remaining the same, well, I&amp;#8217;m sure you know what will happen then. Checkout this quote: &amp;#8220;Gold fell some 4% yesterday with forced selling being seen as hedge funds continue to deleverage and pension funds and other passive investors sell the various commodity indices. In addition, reports from Barclays that some European central banks had sold some 7.6 tons of gold during the week, acted to depress the market. Central bank gold sales and leasing of gold have artificially suppressed the price of gold in recent years but with lease rates surging and central banks concerned about financial, economic and systemic contagion, this source of supply is set to dwindle in the coming months&amp;#8221; source: http://www.dailymarkets.com/contributor/2008/10/17/rumors-of-central-bank-gold-sales-could-depress-prices-in-short-term/ Let&amp;#8217;s also not forget that very little new gold is being added to the world&amp;#8217;s total supply.  Last but not least the purest argument for the increase in the price of gold is really simple. It has to do with the fact that gold is a finite commodity, paper money is not. Paper money is infinite in potential supply and history has shown that nearly all currencies are doomed to be destroyed by the inevitable forces of government excess and unsound financial and economic policies. Governments, nations, fiat currencies come and go, yet gold still remains there as the true and proven protector of savings.  The only thing that can turn this ship around would be deflation. If by some miracle the totaly supply of fiat money were to shrink then naturally the price of gold would decrease along with it, but I see little to no evidence of this happening, so for now I still remain confident that gold will once again test new highs.
