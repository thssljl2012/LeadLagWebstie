Meanwhile, in Charlotte, Wachovia narrowly averts failure:  Crushed by its disastrous 2006 acquisition of mortgage lender Golden West Financial Corp., Wachovia succumbed Monday to the global financial crisis, agreeing to sell its banking operations to New York&amp;#8217;s Citigroup Inc. for a mere $2.1 billion in a deal arranged by federal regulators. Yes, Bank of America Corp. still stands on Tryon Street and is now one of the &amp;#8220;Big Three&amp;#8221; U.S. banks. But the Wachovia collapse leaves Charlotte bracing for the worst _ the loss of thousand of high-paying bank jobs that helped turn the state&amp;#8217;s largest city into a booming center of the New South. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;ve been on the winning end of a countless number of bank transactions over the last 25 years,&amp;#8221; said Tony Plath, a finance professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. &amp;#8220;And that has translated into new jobs and homes and construction. Now, we&amp;#8217;re on the losing end. This is a big loss for the city.&amp;#8221; For years, it was Bank of America and Wachovia playing the aggressor, making deal after deal _ including the 2001 merger of First Union and Wachovia that led to the modern-day bank _ as they worked to create a second Wall Street on Tryon. Wachovia has 120,000 employees nationwide, including 20,000 in Charlotte. An involuntary Buffalo homecoming in the works, perhaps?
