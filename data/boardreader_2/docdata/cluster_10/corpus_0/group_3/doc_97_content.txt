Question: How could Wachovia be a potential acquirer of Morgan Stanley a few days ago and now complete a fireside sale to Citi? Plath: Wachovia's pending failure became evident in the market very quickly last Thursday, based on WaMu's failure and subsequent roll-over into JP Morgan. After WaMu failed, investors targeted for sale other banks with significant subprime loan exposure like Wachovia and National City, and news broke that S&amp;P and Moody's were about to downgrade Wachovia's credit rating. With $3.4 billion in short-term debt up for refinancing on Monday, it quickly became apparent that the credit market would not allow Wachovia to refinance its debt at reasonable interest rates, and at that point the uninsured depositors in the bank are rumored to have started withdrawing their deposits (it's important to point out, however, that Wachovia's management denies this point). Without access to short-term credit and facing the possibility of increased withdrawals, Wachovia quickly faced a liquidity crisis by Friday afternoon. At that point the FDIC stepped in and arranged to merge the bank into a stronger partner with a continuing ability to issue short-term debt in the credit market. That partner turned out to be Citigroup.The week before this turmoil occurred at Wachovia, the bank's access to short-term debt in the credit market seemed much more secure. At that point the bank discussed a potential merger with Morgan Stanley that would combine Wachovia's huge retail banking operation with Morgan's equally substantial investment banking operation, forming a universal bank that could rival competitors like Bank of America and JP Morgan in the market. The speed with which Wachovia fell in the last few days points out just how much turmoil exists in our present financial markets, and just how dangerous it is to operate in these markets for large institutions that have been weakened by significant subprime mortgage loan exposures on their balance sheets.
