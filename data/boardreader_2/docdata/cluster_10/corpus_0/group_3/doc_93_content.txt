We are now down to five major US financial institutions that pose some degree of systemic risk to other banks, largely through their derivatives portfolios:  Citibank, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley.  All of these institutions are now commercial banks, subject to Federal Reserve oversight, and with immediate access to Fed liquidity.  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which were the last of the two great investment banks, are now focused on building up a consumer deposit base as a means to avoid large daily borrowings of short term funds. With the obsession going on in Congress over a massive bailout of the market, arent we now really talking about a massive bailout of these five institutions?  Is it really worth all this trouble for just five banks?  Perhaps there are some better ways to handle the problem. Buzzed, Dugg and Heated
