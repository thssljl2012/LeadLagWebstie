Expect more of this sort of thing in the near future:It seems anxiety from the financial crisis is reaching new highs, but the tipping point for one individual came at the Lehman Brothers gym in the midst of the companys collapse.While former Lehman CEO Richard Fuld was testifying before the House Oversight Committee Oct. 6, CNBC reported he had been punched in the face at the Lehman Brothers gym after it was announced the firm was going bankrupt. CNBC and Vanity Fair contributor Vicki Ward said Fuld was attacked at the gym on a Sunday following the bankruptcy.Frankly, I sat there and listened and Im with the guy who apparently, the day before Barclays announced they were coming in and Lehman had already filed for bankruptcy, went over to him in the gym and punched him because thats how I feel when I, you know, when I watched that, Ward said on the Oct. 6 Power Lunch. I didnt think he was contrite at all, I thought he was arrogant.From here, via Doug in this babble thread.
