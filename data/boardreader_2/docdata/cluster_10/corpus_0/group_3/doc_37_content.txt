A roundup of economic news from around the Web. Rate Cuts?: Echoing today&amp;#8217;s Journal story on the increased possibility of a Fed cut in interest rates, Tim Duy on the  Economist&amp;#8217;s View blog wonders what the purpose would be. &amp;#8220;A cut at this juncture may just be doing something to do something. If the Fed sits tight through the rest of this year, they simply have come to the conclusion that rate cuts are ineffective at this point. Does anyone really believe that another 50bp will have anything more than a marginal impact? As long as the credit markets are impaired, rate cuts are almost a sideshow. Without a mechanism to channel large amounts of dollars to consumers, or some other sector of the economy, the Fed can drop rates to zero with little impact. The price of money only matters if you can get some, and getting some is hard to do when the financial sector is deleveraging in an attempt to save itself.&amp;#8221; Central Planning: Writing for the Project Syndicate, Brad DeLong says there hasnt been enough central planning in finance. &amp;#8220;The U.S. Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and other public financial regulatory entities are being pushed toward a further expansion of their roles. The Treasury and Federal Reserve are adding preferred stock to the balance sheets of the US mortgage giants Fannie Mae and FHLBC and the insurance giant AIG in the hope of shoring up their capital cushions and lowering their borrowing costs so that they can buy more mortgages. The Treasury has asked for authority to purchase $700 billion of mortgages to get them off of the private sectors books. Expanding the demand and reducing the supply of these risky assets is a way of manipulating their price. The Fed and the Treasury are walking down a road that ends with making the price of risk in financial markets, along with the price of liquidity, an administered price. This was how central banking got started in the first place: letting the market and the market alone determine the price of liquidity was judged too costly for the businessmen who voted and the workers who could overthrow governments. Now it looks as though letting the market alone determine the price of risk is similarly being judged too costly for todays voters and campaign contributors to bear.&amp;#8221;  Bailout Hedge Fund: Daniel Gross of Slate writes that the bailout is like a hedge fund. &amp;#8220;What&amp;#8217;s most interesting about the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 is just how much it reads like a prospectus for a hedge fund. In the past, hedge funds &amp;#8212; secretive pools of capital &amp;#8212; were open only to qualified (read: rich) investors. But with the stroke of a pen, President Bush will soon make all American citizens investors in the world&amp;#8217;s biggest fund &amp;#8212; and a democratic one at that. Taxpayers won&amp;#8217;t just be the investors. We&amp;#8217;ll own the management company, too. Best of all? For at least a few months, we&amp;#8217;ll have the former CEO of Goldman Sachs run our investment for a very small fee. Call it the &amp;#8216;Universal Hedge Fund.&amp;#8217;&amp;#8221; European Crisis: A host of European economists write an open letter posted on the voxeu blog on the banking crisis. &amp;#8220;This is a once-in-a-lifetime crisis. Trust among financial institutions is disappearing; fear may spread. Last weeks US experience showed that saving one bank at a time wont work. A systemic response is needed and in Europe this means an EU-led initiative to recapitalise the banking sector. Unless European leaders immediately unite to address this crisis before it spirals out of control, they may find themselves fighting over how best to salvage the aftermath.&amp;#8221;   Compiled by Phil Izzo
