         The next short on Citi is $2.5.  They may need to raise more money to cover the liabilities.  In this market, they may not able to raise 10B to 20B cash with 25B market cap.  WFC has only a set of mortgage problem.  Citi has multi set of mortgage problems.  Once the share price goes down to $2 to $3 range, they will be like AIG situation.  I had a friend, a former insurance agent who brought more shares on AIG at $2.5 and stated that it could not wrong at $2.5.    Of course that was when AIG got $85B from government.  Now they had $167B from government.  Most likely they may seek another $25B from Paulson&amp;#039;s 700B to buy them to the first qtr of 2009.  Hope that the recession will be one qtr away and turn around in third qtr in 2009.  Even my lovely bank holding HBC went down to $45.78 today.  It is very plainful to see my 401k balance.  Here is the opportunity to pick a winner in between AIG and Citi in third qtr in 2009.  1000 shares of AIG or 1000 shares of Citi   At this time I will pick AIG.    ipo99
