Yea, just go ahead and ban all shorting and options and see how much the market likes it.  Notice how much the market fell when they restricted shorting last time?  If you don&amp;#039;t like shorting then don&amp;#039;t do it, but the markets need it. Not every company is well run and profitable and some are even down right criminal. Why can&amp;#039;t I bet against shitty companies or ones run by liars, like GS?  I find picking the losers is a lot easier than picking the winners. Try it sometime.  If your looking to Ban something...how about Socialism or Fascism, or Credit Default Swaps or Paulson...or anyone that voted for the theft of more of our money we don&amp;#039;t have.     Short Sellers  Keep the Market Honest      By  JAMES S. CHANOS               We  are currently witnessing one of the periodic financial convulsions that  inevitably follow eras of easy credit and lax regulation. As someone  once said: &amp;quot;Politicians and people who lose money always need someone  to blame.&amp;quot; So who is to blame now? According to the guardians of our  economy, it&amp;#039;s the short sellers, those investors who believe certain  stocks are overvalued for fundamental reasons.              Martin Kozlowski           In the latest of a  series of constantly changing rules announced overnight without public  comment or participation, the Securities and Exchange Commission has  imposed a ban on short selling 799 financial companies through Oct. 2.  But the regulator has yet to put forward any supporting data, or a  clear justification, for this and prior emergency actions against short  selling this summer.    Meanwhile, the causes of the collapse in the financial sector go  ignored. Never mind that months ago short sellers were warning about  the problems we now see undermining American capitalism. In the spring  of 2007, I joined another fund manager in outlining to finance  ministers and central bankers (at a G-7 finance ministers meeting) the  looming crisis in credit structures and overleveraged banks and  brokerage firms. Our audience listened politely, but, as events now  show, failed to take any meaningful action.    These are extraordinary times, and, as participants in the capital  markets, we need to support the commission&amp;#039;s efforts to ensure that  fraud and manipulation have no place in this market. But the haste,  confusion and scapegoating that has ensued may well do more harm than  good. Unfortunately, the recent spate of hurried actions may worsen the  quality of our capital markets at a time when we need to attract  investors -- both pessimists and optimists -- by promoting deep  liquidity, vigorous price discovery and open competition. These are the  key factors in determining the value of securities.    This tale is not a new one. Short selling has been misunderstood and  maligned throughout history. In the 1630s, England banned short selling  after tulipmania collapsed in the Netherlands to prevent a similar  fallout in England. More recently in Malaysia and Pakistan, short  sellers have been faulted for stock-market busts. In the U.S., we&amp;#039;ve  seen how corporate executives have tried to place the blame for their  failures on short sellers instead of on themselves. In the end, short  sellers -- not management -- defended honesty in the pricing of shares  by demanding accountability. Short sellers openly warned about the  problems at Enron, Tyco, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before their  meltdowns. And when it comes to investigating corporate fraud, it&amp;#039;s the  short sellers who are the detectives, while all too often our  regulators practice archaeology. Indeed, my firm was among the first to  raise red flags about Enron&amp;#039;s finances.    The vast majority of equity short sales are market neutral; the  short seller has no fundamental view of a company&amp;#039;s outlook but is  taking a short position to hedge risks. A short seller may want to lock  in a spread, hedge a convertible bond by shorting the same company&amp;#039;s  equity, or add liquidity in mergers by buying the target company and  shorting the survivor.    As Warren Buffett has acknowledged, though, &amp;quot;it&amp;#039;s a tough way to  make a living,&amp;quot; because over time stock markets rise more than they  fall, the transaction costs are high, and the risks great.    Regardless of the reasons why an institution may take a short  position, there is an important fact to keep in mind: Compared to the  total volume of securities transactions, short selling comprises  roughly 4% of total shares outstanding on the New York Stock Exchange.  Short-biased funds make up a small fraction of the $2 trillion managed  by private investment companies.    Still, when times get tough, the accusations fly, even though most  research suggests investors and financial markets benefit from short  selling. Specifically, short sellers act as &amp;quot;safety valves.&amp;quot; Their  transactions help to bring share prices to levels supported by the  fundamentals, decreasing the likelihood of price bubbles. Short selling  also improves market quality and efficiency by narrowing spreads,  improving the speed of price adjustments based on new information, and  pumping liquidity into the market.    In the past, SEC Chairman Christopher Cox and Federal Reserve  Chairman Ben Bernanke have both expressed their views that short  selling is valuable. They make the point that overinflated securities  prices waste valuable capital and harm investors, as occurred in the  dot-com bust in 2001. &amp;quot;We need the shorts in the market for balance so  we don&amp;#039;t have bubbles,&amp;quot; said Mr. Cox.    But in a week when the markets froze, assets became untradeable, and  investor trust plummeted, policy makers rushed to stop the bleeding. In  the unfolding drama, short sellers were an easy target and quickly cast  as the Darth Vaders of Wall Street.    I believe the SEC was tough but balanced with the three initiatives  announced last Wednesday. Broker-dealers who lie about their ability to  deliver borrowed securities should face the consequences under  anti-fraud rules. And, broker-dealers should deliver stocks sold in a  short sale within three days of a trade.    But apparently this was not enough. After last Wednesday&amp;#039;s  announcement, pressure mounted for the SEC to do even more as its  counterpart in London ratcheted up its regulatory responses. By evening  on &amp;quot;Black Wednesday,&amp;quot; the SEC had decided to require investment  managers to publicly report their short positions weekly.    I believe the SEC has every right to obtain and review information  about short positions for market surveillance purposes, but forcing  public disclosure will have serious consequences for the market.  Companies may retaliate against short sellers. Fund managers will lose  their ability to manage assets without revealing their strategy. Other  traders will &amp;quot;pile on,&amp;quot; and may trigger panicky selling if an investor  sees that noted short sellers have shorted the stock.    On Friday, the SEC went even further with its short-selling ban,  following a similar move by the Financial Services Authority in the  United Kingdom. Halting trading activity will only worsen market  conditions and exacerbate volatility, hindering the ability of markets  to do what they do best. Economists have long believed that market  prices are best set by a variety of viewpoints, including by those with  no previous ownership interest. In the financial markets, that latter  group is the short-sellers. As a former SEC chief economist aptly  observed, &amp;quot;To ban short selling is to in effect say that the government  is going to try to determine what stock prices should be.&amp;quot;    For our investors and our country to emerge with strength from these  extraordinarily difficult times, it is imperative that our regulatory  bodies respond in a way that appropriately balances vigilant protection  of investors with open, vigorous competition. Closing down short  sellers will not work to help the U.S. maintain the freest, strongest  and most liquid capital markets in the world.

During the nearly three-week ban on shorting financial shares, the market sank 21.5%. Are regulators after the wrong parties?           By David Bogoslaw          updated  7:00 p.m. ET,   Tues., Oct. 14, 2008                  As the panicked selling in equities markets around the world has  accelerated over the past two weeks, there have been several attempts  to slow the process, including the temporary suspension of trading on  stock exchanges from Moscow to Milan. In the U.S., the Securities &amp;amp;amp;  Exchange Commission banned short-selling -- bets that shares of certain  companies would fall -- on a list of more than 800 financial stocks  whose balance sheets have exposure to risky mortgage-backed securities  and other distressed products.        When the ban,  which lasted 13 trading days, was lifted on Oct. 9, it signaled a  return to business as usual for the financial sector. Shares of Morgan  Stanley (MS), one of the last-standing investment banks, which recently  became a bank holding company subject to tighter government regulation,  sold off with a vengeance, finishing almost 26% lower on Oct. 9 and  dropping an additional 24% on Oct. 10. Insurance stocks such as  Prudential Financial (PRU) and Hartford  Financial Services  Group (HIG) were also among the biggest losers on Oct. 9.          Whether the ban had the intended effect remains open to debate, given  the 21.5% drop in the Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s 500-stock index from the  market close on Sept. 19, before the ban took effect, through its last  day, Oct. 8. And the nearly 33% plunge during the same period in the  KBW Bank Index [BKX], which has a much closer correlation with the 800  names traders were ...
