 Neil... I don&amp;#039;t know that this thread is the place for this and hopefully the mods will let us know, but it is certainly true that what we have been doing should not and cannot continue.  This was a true house of cards or domino thing, triggered by the subprime housing market, that crashed a series of interconnected markets...        Subprime mortgage loans went into mortgage backed securities (MBS) or asset backed securities (ABS), tranches of these or entire securities were used as partial collateral for collaterialized debt obligations (CDO&amp;#039;s), which were also the home for commercial mortgage backed securities&amp;#039; (CMBS) B-pieces.  Soooo, when home loans went bad, the MBS and ABS prices went down,  the loan defaults caused the securities eventually to default, then the CDO&amp;#039;s went down even more and defaulted even faster, because the worst pieces of the MBS and ABS securities went in as the basic collateral to them.  Issuers couldn&amp;#039;t issue more of them.  This meant there was no home for CMBS B-pieces, which drove the spreads wide for CMBS securities and made conduit (stuff going into CMBS eventually) real estate loans much more expensive from a rate (spread) perspective.  CMBS spreads for AAA tranches of the securirties went from a 25 basis points (a quarter of one point) over the index Treasury rate to over 1000 basis points (10%) over.  Eventually, the CMBS market ($200billion a year) stopped.  They are no more.  CDO&amp;#039;s are no more.  Many loans and securities are no more.      So, commercial real estate loans are no longer available except from insurance companies or banks willing to hold them on their balance sheets.  These guys are too conservative, so the lower advance rates and higher rates meant buyers couldn&amp;#039;t pay the same prices for buildings or they wouldn&amp;#039;t meet their investors return hurdles, plus the insurance companies and banks &amp;amp;quot;ran out of money&amp;amp;quot;, since they were being asked to fund their traditional share of about $150b a year, PLUS the $200b a year previously funded by CMBS securities no longer being issued.  They largely ran out of money in about July.           Banks (WAMU), insurance companies (AIG), investment banks (Merrill, Lehman, Bear) who were holding any of these securities have to mark them to market under Federal Accounting Standards Board (FASB) regulations.  If an asset is being held to maturity, as opposed to held for trading, you don&amp;#039;t have to mark it to market.  However, if the asset becomes &amp;amp;quot;impaired&amp;amp;quot;, as in it has no one willing to buy it on the open market, even if its not for sale, it has to be marked to market.  Soooo, AIG holds a lot of this stuff we&amp;#039;re talking about and its performing just fine thank you, but is in a class of security that has been hammered in the market, well, instead of being worth 100 cents on the dollar, its now artificially worth 25 cents on the dollar.  If half of AIG&amp;#039;s assets are re-marked this way, all of a sudden its asset value is waaaaaaay down, the shorts come in, make a huge killijng shorting the stock in a dogpile on the poor company, the stock has plunged and Voila, AIG is bankrupt, though there was nothing really wrong.        Anyway, this isn&amp;#039;t meant to be comprehensive, but is a quick study on what&amp;#039;s been going on and why its a house-of-cards thing.  Its a killer.  But, it wasn&amp;#039;t and isn&amp;#039;t what you see on idiot TV (CNN).  Its far to complicated for Wolf Blitzer to ever understand, if you see what I mean.      Now back to our regularly scheduled programming...         Gordon
