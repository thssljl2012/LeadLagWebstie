 FNM Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 8              Roubini:  GS and MS could go tits up   &amp;quot;After the bust of Bear and Lehman and the merger of Merrill with  BofA I suggested that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs should also  merge with a large financial institution that has a large base of  insured deposits so as to avoid a run on their overnite liabilities.  Instead Morgan and Goldman went for the cosmetic approach of converting  into bank holding companies as a way to get further liquidity support   and regulation as banks  of the Fed and as a way to acquire safe  deposits. But neither institution can create in a short time a  franchise of branches and neither one has the time and resources to  acquire smaller banks. And the injection of $8 b of Japanese capital  into Morgan and $5 b of capital from Buffett into Goldman is a drop in  the ocean as both institutions need much more capital. Thus, the gambit  of converting into bank while not being banks yet has not worked and  the run against them has accelerated in the last week: Morgans CDS  spread went through the roof on Friday to over 1200 and the firm has  already lost over a third of its hedge funds clients together with  their highly profitable prime brokering business (this is really a kiss  of death for Morgan); and the coming roll-off of the interbank lines to  Morgan would seal its collapse. Even Goldman Sachs is under severe  stress losing business, losing money, experiencing a severe widening of  its CDS spreads and at risk of losing most of its values most of its  lines of business (including trading) are now losing money.   Both institutions are highly recommended to stop dithering  and playing for time as delay will be destructive: they should merge  now with a large foreign financial institution as no US institution is  sound enough and large enough to be a sound merger partner.  If Mack and  Blankfein dont want to end up like Fuld they should do today a Thain  and merge as fast as they can with another large commercial banks.   Maybe Mitsubishi and a bunch of Japanese life insurers can take over  Morgan; in Europe Barclays has its share of capital trouble and has  just swallowed part of Lehman; while most other UK banks are too weak  to take over Goldman. The only institution sound enough to swallow  Goldman may be HSBC. Or maybe Nomura in Japan should make a bid for  Goldman. Either way Mack and Blankfein should sell at a major discount  of current price their firm before they end up like Bear and be offered  in a few weeks a couple of bucks a share for their faltering operation.  And the Fed and Treasury should tell them to hurry up as they are both  much bigger than Bear or Lehman and their collapse would have severe  systemic effects.&amp;quot;     http://www.rgemonitor.com/roubini-monitor/253801/the_us_and_global_financial_crisis_is_becoming_much_more_severe_in_spite_of_the_treasury_rescue_plan_the_risk_of_a_total_systemic_meltdown_is_now_as_high_as_ever
