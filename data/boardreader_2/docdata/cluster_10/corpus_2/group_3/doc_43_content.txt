Seems to me that AIG is guaranteeing loans now in default so the  winner is still the guys/companies who sold the (overblown) asset  to the defaulter and the defaulters who now get insurance  assistance. The losers would normally be the lendor but AIG took  the risk instead. AIG was obviously at fault for not assessing  proper risk like all the other Banks.
