 huh ?      Credit default swaps, these paper contracts turn out to be a key culprit in the current crisis, implicated in the demise of the giant brokerage company Bear Stearns, the giant insurer AIG, and perhaps more giants to come.      As of last year, according to an industry group, there were not $62 million, not $62 billion, but $62 trillion worth of credit default swaps out there. That&amp;#039;s more than four times as much as the GDP of the entire U.S. economy.      In total, AIG wrote some $450 billion worth of credit default swap insurance, covering disasters it was sure would never happen, booking profits on almost every swap it sold, paying the average employee of its swap unit a million dollars a year out of those supposed profits, thereby depleting further the way-too-small pool of assets it would have on hand for claims, were disaster to strike.            Sad note for you fans of the premiership.   Now that the Fed owns 80% of AIG, the sweaters of Manchester United are to be changed to read U.S.A. instead of A I G
