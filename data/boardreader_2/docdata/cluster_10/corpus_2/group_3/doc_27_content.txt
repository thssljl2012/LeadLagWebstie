There&amp;#039;s 3 things I learned that we need to understand before we figure out what we have to do going forward:        1) Without the government&amp;#039;s actions, the collapse of AIG could have caused every major bank in the world to fail.        2) Without the credit default swap market, there&amp;#039;s no way banks can report the true value of their assets - they&amp;#039;d all be in default. That&amp;#039;s why the government will enact laws that require the suspension of mark-to-market accounting. Essentially, banks will be allowed to pretend they have far higher-quality loans than they actually do. AIG can&amp;#039;t cover for them anymore. Our &amp;amp;quot;recovery&amp;amp;quot; plan includes false accounting.        3) Without the huge fraud perpetrated by AIG, the mortgage bubble could have never grown as large as it did. Yes, other factors contributed, like the role of Fannie and Freddie in particular. But the key to enabling the huge global growth in credit during the last decade can be tied directly to AIG&amp;#039;s sale of credit default swaps without collateral. This went on for a decade, exacerbating the problem.        I agree with some of the asset allocation suggestions in this thread. But a flight to quality means not only gold, but also to well-capitalized market share leaders who are being undeservedly punished. I have my targets, but every individual needs to find their own comfort level.
