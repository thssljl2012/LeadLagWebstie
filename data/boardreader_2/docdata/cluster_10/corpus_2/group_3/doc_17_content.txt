well, there is much more to it. Last week, the US Fed deposited $70  B into AIG to provide collateral for credit default swaps insurance  that AIG had sold (and now cannot meet payment on them). That means  someone had purchased them, and is now owed $70B. Who is that lucky  someone ? That is unrelated to home sales or stock sales or  business sales of any kind. These are just pure bets between third  parties on whether a bond issuer defaults or not.      It is like you and me betting on whether it will rain tomorrow or  not. Supposedly these bets total $350 trillion.
