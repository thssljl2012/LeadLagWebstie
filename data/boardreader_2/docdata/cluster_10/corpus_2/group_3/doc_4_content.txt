  Golden Parachutes      Though they were at the helm of companies that were bruised or broken by the credit crunch, these 12 CEOs still qualified for big severance packages. Take a look at these subprime CEOs and their golden parachutes, including the one who apparently declined his multi-million dollar exit package. The packages include cash, benefits, stock options and other forms of compensation and are based on company proxy statements.     (Data from James F. Reda &amp;amp;amp; Associates, the prominent independent compensation consultant.)    Alan Fishman    Total:    $19 million   Company:  Washington Mutual    Fishman was paid $19 million  for three weeks of work . He joined WaMu on Sept. 8 and left on Sept. 25, 2008. The bank was seized by the FDIC -- the largest bank failure in US history -- and parts of it were bought by JPMorgan Chase.       Stanley O&amp;#039;Neal     Total:    $161 million     Company:  Merrill Lynch    Merrill Lynch ousted O&amp;#039;Neal from his position on Oct. 28, 2007 shortly after the company reported $8 billion in write-downs. John Thain replaced him as CEO.       Charles Prince       Total:    $105 million   Company:  Citigroup    Prince resigned from his position on Nov. 4, 2007 after the company announced $11 billion in write-downs.       Angelo Mozilo       Total:    $56 million     Company:  Countrywide    Mozilo stepped down from the CEO spot on July 1, 2008 after leading Countrywide for 39 years.

Ken Thompson       Total:    $42 million     Company:  Wachovia    Thompson was removed from his position on June 1, 2008 following questions about a major acquisition as well as heavy losses. Once the fourth largest bank in the US, Wachovia was later bought by Citigroup in Sept. 2008.       Richard Fuld       Total:    $24 million     Company:  Lehman Brothers     Fuld&amp;#039;s four-decade career with Lehman took a hit on Sept. 15, 2008 when the investment bank filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the largest such case in US history.    Correction:  The original caption stated that Fuld&amp;#039;s career &amp;amp;quot;came to an end&amp;amp;quot;, implying he was no longer with the firm, effective Sept. 17, at the time Barclays officially announced it was buying parts of Lehman. In fact, Fuld has remained with the firm since the Chapter 11 filing on Sept. 15. Furthermore, the introductory page to this slideshow feature stated that all of the CEOs pictured had &amp;amp;quot;lost their jobs.&amp;amp;quot;        Richard Syron       Total:    $16 million     Company:  Freddie Mac    Freddie Mac, led by Syron until Sept. 8, 2008, was taken over by the federal government along with Fannie Mae.

John Thain       Total:    $9 million     Company:  Merrill Lynch    Thain served as CEO of Merrill Lynch for less than a year, before Bank of America bought the investment bank for $50 billion on Sept. 14, 2008.

He was replaced as CEO on Sept. 17, 2008 after the company received an $85-billion loan from the federal government in exchange for a 79.9 percent stake in the company.
