       For the most part derivatives are insurance contracts, although some use them as speculation vehicles &amp;amp;lt;g&amp;amp;gt;  When a large financial flood happens, flood insurers get broke, flood victims don&amp;#039;t get paid, real estate drops, cause flood insurance gets very expensive. The latter is really a reflection how derivative collapse influences asset prices.  And then... there are transactions between banks. When a few collapse, they stop trusting insurance someone wrote, and then stop dealing with each other. The market freezes. The credit market froze last week, as insurance contracts written by Lehman, Merrill and AIG were open ended, with nobody on the other side.  In the bond market, for example, when a subprime borrower comes and asks for a loan, while the AAA-rated company insures the debt written, it makes it much easier to get a loan, and there are plenty of buyers of AAA-rated debt  created from a bad borrower. Now the insurance companies collapsed and don&amp;#039;t want to insure anything, insurance got extremely expensive. On top, not many want to insure. So, things collapse below where the bottom would be, should there be no insurers in the first place.
