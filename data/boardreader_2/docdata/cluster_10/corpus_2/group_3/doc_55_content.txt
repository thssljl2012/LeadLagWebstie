 With some of the top banks in the US, Britain, Europe and Japan in trouble or are bankrupt (LEH, WM, WB, etc) and the largest insurance company in the world AIG close to insolvency we are in for a very long depression. Bombardier shares are at a bargain price but so are the shares of so many companies. Bombardier has a P/E of 7.74 with growth, enough cash to pay off their debt and a eye popping $57 billion backlog. However, panic sellers and short sellers are forcing the shares to a new 52 week low. Why? Panic overrules fundamentals and logic. I will be buying more shares.
