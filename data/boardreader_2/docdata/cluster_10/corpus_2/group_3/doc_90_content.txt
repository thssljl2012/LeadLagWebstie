The government told them to invest the surpluses of cash councils and police authorities    , had in excess of their immediate expenditures and stick them in a bank...            Many councils/police forces and local authorities saw the icelandic banks 7-8% interest rate and put it there...            Not realising that the higher the interest rate the riskier the bank happens to be , because they are short on capital and want to recapitalise as soon as possible thus        Higher interest rate = more desparate    Higher interest rate = riskier            B&amp;amp;B was offering 6.7% AER = high risk    A&amp;amp;L was offering 8.1% AER = high risk        etc etc        Now HSBC and Barclays are also in the sh*t , the difference is that HSBC and Barclays are only neck deep in the Sh*t while B&amp;amp;B now defunct , northern Rock , Hbos etc , had vanished below the surface of the pool of sh*t.        And thus they haven&amp;#039;t jumped in on the high interest rate wagon yet and still offer terribly savings rates for their customers...        Its pretty much like Bonds,        AAA bonds = low yield but 0% chance of default    BBB bonds = higher yield but larger chance of default    CCC Bonds and below = junk very high yield but companies of this type fold easily (see GM and Ford).  ____________________ If you wake up at a different time, in a different place, could you wake up as a different person?
