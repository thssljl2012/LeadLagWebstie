 LVLT Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              the core of the crisis?  soc can you comment    i read the article by prem wasta and it seems that he believes the key issue to the crisis.&amp;amp;nbsp; here&amp;#039;s a part of the interview...    &amp;amp;nbsp;     Aren&amp;#039;t the derivatives, or swaps, what sank Wall Street and AIG?    A. &amp;quot;AIG wrote US$450 billion in credit default swaps [in its London office] without any capital or reserves behind these [potential losses of $23 billion] unlike the rest of its insurance business. Rating agencies accepted these. The employees got one-third of profits and 400 [in this swaps division] made an average of US$1 million a year. Derivatives were insurance without anything behind them.&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;This affected Wall Street because AIG then laid off this risk with Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. The others disappeared for the same reason.&amp;quot;       as i recall what you said was that the CDS market didn&amp;#039;t require parties to have collatoral to support their trades.&amp;amp;nbsp; so you have institutions that wrote tons of business then as those bets came(are coming) due, you have 1) a bunch of counterparites that cannot pay the bill, and or 2) a bunch of companies that insured the transactions that cannot pay if the counterparty fails to pay.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    is that a correct assessment of the issue from your perspective?&amp;amp;nbsp; could you clarify or enhance my basic`understanding of the issue?&amp;amp;nbsp; tia.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    thejuice.    &amp;amp;nbsp;
