 Your cartoon shows Fuld with the Barclay&amp;#039;s logo on his hcest. But Fuld isn&amp;#039;t going to be getting a check for Barclays, ever. They&amp;#039;re not giving him a job. Barclays has bought assets from Lehman Brothers in a forced sale (including their HQ, where Fuld no longer works); Those assets aren&amp;#039;t part of Lehman any more. Fuld still works for Lehmans, most of whose assets have since been sold off. Why do you think he&amp;#039;s working for Barclays?  It&amp;#039;s like if YOU went bankrupt, and your house was sold to one person, your car was sold to someone else, and your computer to a third person. you&amp;#039;re left with a few sticks of furntiture and the clothes on your back. That doesn&amp;#039;t make you an agent of the person who bought your house, does it?
