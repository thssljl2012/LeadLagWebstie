They didn&amp;#039;t have CDS exposure, they simply had a portfolio of bad loans.  The problem was with poor judgment about risk. Even by rating agencies, who considered top tranches of CMOs to be as high as AAA. The cap ratio problems that ensued after these investments began for fall are what pinched banks. Blaming this on CDS is an interesting but ultimately misguided attempt to place blame on lack of regulation .                      More then just poor judgement.      How about intentionally understating risk due to conflict of interests. The rating agencies were getting paid to advise how to package the MBS&amp;#039;s in order to get AAA ratings on SUBPRIME debt. Now if I was getting paid lots of money to ensure AAA ratings for AAA MBS&amp;#039;s and I want to continue to get that money, I better rate those MBS&amp;#039;s as AAA.      As for CDS&amp;#039;s it is CDS&amp;#039;s that is causing the most of the international problems. They are the cascade, they are what caused AIG to go belly up, they are part of the 400 trillion derivative market that Buffet called Weapons of financial destruction
