Lehman was an investment bank.  When it failed, the primary losers were those that invested with them.      AIG is hugely different.  AIG is an insurance company, and the banks made investments and bought insurance on this investments from AIG.      If AIG failed, what is described in the article with mark-to-market would have happened many-fold, all over the world.  Every AIG-insured investment would have immediately been unsaleable, or at least only able to be sold at a huge discount to the original price.  As a result, banks all over the world would have failed.      Not just investment banks, but retail banks -- banks that hold your savings and checking accounts.  And when that happened, then the government would have had to step in and pay out billions on FDIC to depositors in those banks.      The difficult thing here is mark-to-market.  Banks are only allowed to count the value that an asset could sell for today.  In normal circumstances, that is fine.  But in a market panic, that is not a good measure of the actual value of the asset.  And the destruction of asset value by market panics is the main driver in those banks that are failing or needing bailouts.  Their mortgage assets will probably pay, but the value which regulation requires them to place on those assets is significantly understating their likely worth.      And if AIG failed, that panic would have been beyond anything we&amp;#039;ve seen yet.
