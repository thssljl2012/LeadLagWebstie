AIG to focus on core insurance units, plans sale of rest - USATODAY.com       After hearing Lehman&amp;#039;s ex-CEO talk yesterday, I bet D.C. is breathing a big sigh of relief that they didn&amp;#039;t help that idiot, and his company, recover.       House panel suggests Lehman execs misled - USATODAY.com    &amp;amp;quot;Until the day they put me in the ground I will wonder&amp;amp;quot; why Lehman wasn&amp;#039;t rescued, Fuld told the panel.       But committee members repeatedly read internal company e-mails and documents they said showed Lehman executives knew of the company&amp;#039;s mushrooming crisis even while they publicly proclaimed its balance sheet strong.       In assessing why Lehman posted record losses the previous 12 months, a June document says the firm &amp;amp;quot;saw warning signs&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;did not move early/fast enough.&amp;amp;quot; Yet on an earnings call days later, executives described the firm&amp;#039;s capital and liquidity position as &amp;amp;quot;never stronger,&amp;amp;quot; said Rep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y. Fuld said he wasn&amp;#039;t familiar with the document.       In mid-September, just days before Lehman collapsed, it was pressed by a partner for an extra $5 billion in collateral for its trades. Yet a day later, Fuld told investors the firm was &amp;amp;quot;on the right track to put these last two quarters behind us.&amp;amp;quot;       &amp;amp;quot;People want to know if you defrauded investors by coming out and saying that,&amp;amp;quot; says Rep. John Mica, R-Fla.       Fuld said he &amp;amp;quot;firmly believed&amp;amp;quot; Lehman was digging out of its mess by reducing its debt and raising capital through the planned spinoff of its commercial real estate unit. &amp;amp;quot;There was certainly no attempt to mislead anyone,&amp;amp;quot; he said.       Committee members also accused Fuld of reaping big payouts even as the firm careened toward bankruptcy. One document obtained by the committee shows the firm&amp;#039;s executive compensation committee approving giving three dismissed executives more than $20 million in severance days before Lehman sought bankruptcy-court protection. Fuld said the payments were justified.      Noting that Fuld has received at least $350 million in salary and bonuses since 2000, committee Chairman Henry Waxman, D-Calif., asked, &amp;amp;quot;Is that fair for a CEO of a company that&amp;#039;s bankrupt to have made that kind of money?&amp;amp;quot;       Fuld said he had 10 million shares of Lehman stock, now worthless, when the company went into bankruptcy court.  (HEY FULD, Congress didn&amp;#039;t ask you how much you didn&amp;#039;t make, they asked you how much you made....moron.)
