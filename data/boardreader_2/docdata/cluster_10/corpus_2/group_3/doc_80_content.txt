The source seems to be legit, as in it is from someone who would know.&amp;amp;nbsp; The buying seems to be from Q2, I&amp;#039;m curious if the number gets update for Q3 soon.&amp;amp;nbsp; I don&amp;#039;t know if it is somewhere on the SEC site, I haven&amp;#039;t found it yet.      toes                     thread start
