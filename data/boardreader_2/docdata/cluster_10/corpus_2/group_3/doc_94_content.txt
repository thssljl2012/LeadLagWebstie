    I&amp;#039;m not so sure we are facing such a huge crises from the CDS market.  The bomb will only go off if default rates go through the roof.  They are rising but we are not in trouble yet.  If we start to see some big names in trouble over the next few months then I agree, we could be facing a financial black hole that makes the banking collapses look like chump change.      Having said that, CDS contracts bought to take out default risk from assets already held wont add to the total losses.  They just move the liability elsewhere.  Its the huge issuance of CDS that has been used by pension funds, hedge funds and the like to get low cost exposure to an asset without having to access the cash markets.  The totals of these contracts add up to many time more than the cash bonds they represent.  Sensible players will have bought and sold protection to net off to little or low exposure (like Barclays have announced their exposure on Lehmans).  The mavericks could be in all sort of trouble.  There is real potential for a black hole in a Hedge fund of LTCM kind of proportions thats for sure.
