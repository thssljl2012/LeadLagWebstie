 There are many factors involved, but here are a few:      1) Credit Default Swaps were created.  Basically, if I&amp;#039;m a bank and I&amp;#039;m giving out loans, Credit Default Swaps allow me to take out insurance on those loans.  If a loan fails, I get paid a certain amount.  It sounds very safe, until you consider that companies were making big bucks off Credit Default Swaps, and insuring massive amounts of SubPrime loans, without the collateral to really pay them off.  One small group in AIG did this, and brought down the whole company.  They apparently escaped regulation because AIG has a good insurance rating and the small group was set up as a bank and not an insurer.      b) Mortgage loans were bundled and sold as investments.  They were considered safe, since mortgages are safe in general, especially when you diversify by geography (i.e. you would never invest in 100 motgages in the same flood zone).  Also, the mortgages were covered by Credit Default Swaps (Actually, I&amp;#039;m not sure about that part).  However, these investments were so popular, that demand went up for them.  So the big banks tried to match the demand by creating more mortgages, and the SubPrime market exploded, going from something like 5% to 25% of all loans in a couple of years.  The investments that contained large numbers of subprime loans were sold the same as any other bundle of mortgages - there was no way for the buyer to distringuish them.      So the SubPrimes start going bad, and the investments start going bad.  AIG goes down rapidly because they have a ton of Credit Default Swaps, unbeknownst to most of the company.  Washington Mutual goes down quickly because the have a ton of SubPrime loans.  etc.  But those are the direct hits.        The indirect hits soon follow:   1) Because these bundles of SubPrime Mortgages are all over the place, including in the investments of companies that themselves have large numbers of investors.     2) Because SubPrime loans helped drive the housing market up, there are a large number of overvalued homes.  Suddenly, people can&amp;#039;t sell their house for a profit, killing in many case their #1 investment.  There are also many people that bought homes as an investment to resell.   3) People that have a subprime mortgage (typically first time buyers with a lack of financial savvy) are trying to pay off mortgages that they cannot afford, and cannot sell the house.  This is an unpredictable group, some give up on the mortgage, some run up credit card debt, some stop paying other bills.
