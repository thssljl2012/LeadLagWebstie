         I&amp;#039;m waiting to see if the Lehmans trust preferred issues continue paying their interest.  These are Lehmans CBTCS preferred issues listed in the Lehman&amp;#039;s stock list in the newspapers or in the WSJ preferred stock list.  Each is effectively a long bond.  The bond is held by Lehmans in trust for the preferred shareholder.  Interest on the bond it paid immediately to the shareholder.  This lets you buy and sell a bond at discount broker commissions with market prices published--very unlike most bonds which are traded OTC with prices not published.  But of course if the bond gets sucked into the Lehmans deal, it is a problem.  So far none of my Lehman&amp;#039;s issues have come to dividend date, but the others from Citibank, MS, and ML are continuing to pay.  I would think that this trust preferred business would be a source of income that Lehmans would try to protect or even sell to Barclays.  But at this time no one seems to know for sure.  The uncertainty risk is certainly there.  No wonder investors are nervous.  Nothing seems to be really safe except maybe Treasury bonds.
