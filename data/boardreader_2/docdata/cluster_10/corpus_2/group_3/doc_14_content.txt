  marinauser, I also followed the related link in the story.   Worth of the Lehman CDO&amp;#039;s was 8.7 cents on the dollar.    91.3 cents was covered by AIG CDS (insurance)      AIG needed the 90 billion from the FED to cover Lehman&amp;#039;s    debt. Because AIG was already essentially broke.    http://seekingalpha.com/article/99619-lehman-s-cds-mess-who-s-on-the-hook          So, if you follow the papered moneytrail, theFED bailed out Lehman   CDO debt , via AIG CDS (insurance) with FED Taxpayer money.       The funny part is the proclamation from the CDO cheif honcho,    Robert Pickel.   This shows that the CDS market continued to function and is liquid.   The only reason the CDS market even still exists is due to the FED loan to AIG.      No the sky did not fall.   The US taxpayer is TEMPORARILY holding it up.
