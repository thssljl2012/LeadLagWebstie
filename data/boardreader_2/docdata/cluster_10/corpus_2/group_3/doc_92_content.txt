ORCHESTRATED - 100% TRUE - as far as I&amp;#039; m concerned.         Also market manipulation - What activity did the SEC temporarily stop  ?         Did Obama know something about the economy we didn&amp;#039;t? Maybe and why?    _________________________________________________________________________    I first said in January or February that the Dems, beside Iraq were going to have to make the economy look bad for the election.     I made a post six months ago, when the Media / Press started frequently talking about our bad economy, despite that most of the fundamentals were good.     Three and Four months ago I said you can turn the economy by fright and fear. Yell Fire in a crowded theater and you create panic. The Press was daily suggesting bad economy.         PROPHECY BY PROJECTION BECOMES REALITY.         Two months ago the Press started saying Recession, Recession.             Obama since he was &amp;amp;quot;nominated&amp;amp;quot; in every speech, talk, news blurb has consistently and relentlessly mentioned bad economy. That has been his primary message. I could question who mentioned it more - The Press or Obama? But both together - one echoing the other did create financial panic with the &amp;#039;General&amp;#039; public.             When the negative screaming about the economy by the Media of &amp;amp;quot;Recession&amp;amp;quot; and Obama&amp;#039;s daily preaching about the economy reached far enough into Publics brain, the financial market started to be affected by fear. The Boil was squeezed until it Burst.  It pushed the Mortgage problem over the cliff and it fell and spilled its contents. .             I have to ask. Why was the first issue and in a way the major issue Obama  has used in every speech he has made been since he became a candidate been our Bad Economy?         Did he know more than everybody else?     Why did the Press start talking Recession before it was even on the horizon?    Did he know there was going to be an effort of making the economy look bad that would help him?         I believe there was a concerted effort to make the economy look bad using the housing maket. But like a cancer once you open it and look inside there is the chance it will spread, as it did.         I THINK IT WENT TOO FAR AND BLEW UP IN THEIR FACE.         With the Stock Market there is little to no reporting to th epublic of who or what is buying and selling how, what, when or where.         As a rule or general  with really large corporations  if you own 5% of the stock you can often control the company indirectly which is why you sometimes see one individual sitting on many company boards.         With the Market  margins are very low for lots of instruments, which allows considerable manipulation if you have a large nest egg.     ___________________________________________________________________________        SHORT SELLING IS DONE BY HEDGE FUNDS         RECENTLY THE SEC BANNED SHORT SELLING TEMPORARILY        INTERNATIONAL BANKS HAVE NOW BANNED SHORT SELLING         WHO DOES SHORT SELLING AND WHO ARE THE PRINCIPAL SHORT SELLERS?        GEORGE SOROS IS     _________________________________________________________________________    WIKIPEDIA         A hedge fund is a private investment fund open to a limited range of investors which is permitted by regulators to undertake a wider range of activities than other investment funds and which pays a performance fee to its investment manager. Although each fund will have its own strategy which determines the type of investments and the methods of investment it undertakes, hedge funds as a class invest in a broad range of investments, from shares, debt and commodities to works of art.        As the name implies, hedge funds often seek to offset potential losses in the principal markets they invest in by hedging their investments using a variety of methods, most notably short selling. However, the term &amp;amp;quot;hedge fund&amp;amp;quot; has come to be applied to many funds that do not actually hedge their investments, and in particular to funds using short selling and other &amp;amp;quot;hedging&amp;amp;quot; methods to increase rather than reduce risk, with the expectation of increasing return.        Hedge funds are typically open only to a limited range of professional or wealthy investors. This provides them with an exemption in many jurisdictions from regulations governing short selling, derivative contracts, leverage, fee structures and the liquidity of investments in the fund. A hedge fund will nevertheless voluntarily limit the scope of its activities via its contractual arrangements with the individual investors in order to give them some certainty surrounding the specific investments that will be invested by the hedge fund itself.        The assets under management of a hedge fund can run into many billions of dollars, and this will usually be multiplied by leverage, meaning that their influence over markets is substantial. Hedge funds dominate certain specialty markets such as trading within derivatives with high-yield ratings and distressed                 TOP 50 HEDGE FUNDS          YOU THINK YOUR DOING WELL WITH A 12% - 20 % RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT?
