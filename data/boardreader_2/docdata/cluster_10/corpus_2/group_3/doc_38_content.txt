         &amp;amp;quot;That seems pretty generous considering what a poor credit risk these guys have shown themselves to be. &amp;amp;quot;  That&amp;#039;s why it is 8%...others would have charged them 12 or 1 5 or 20%!   http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122156561931242905.html   I was wrong...the interest rate is not 8% on the loan to AIG.....the 85 billion buck 2 year loan...it is 8.5% plus LIBOR!!!! (now about 4-4.5%!)......   &amp;amp;quot;he U.S. negotiators drove a hard bargain. Under terms hammered out Tuesday night, the Fed will lend up to $85 billion to AIG, and the U.S. government will effectively get a 79.9% equity stake in the insurer in the form of warrants called equity participation notes.  The two-year loan will carry an interest rate of Libor plus 8.5 percentage points.  (Libor, the London interbank offered rate, is a common short-term lending benchmark.)  The loan is secured by AIG&amp;#039;s assets, including its profitable insurance businesses, giving the Fed some protection even if markets continue to sink. And if AIG rebounds, taxpayers could reap a big profit through the government&amp;#039;s equity stake.  You couldn&amp;#039;t find a deal this good...own 80% of the company, get about 14% interest for 2 years...  And you think we are &amp;#039;bailing&amp;#039; them out at taxpayer expense?  In case you haven&amp;#039;t figured it out, each month the gov&amp;#039;t collects about a billion bucks, repeat, billion bucks in interest on the loan.     The gov&amp;#039;t can borrow at ,what, now 1% for 90 day note?  Or 4% for 5 year note...so it is making 10% on its money above its costs...  heck, hand me a trillion dollars of deals like this!   We can make 10 billion a month in money.....pay for the end of the war in Iraq, and Obama&amp;#039;s new war front in Afghanistan....and elsewhere...plus even pay healthcare for 100,000 new people......  Oh...gee..that&amp;#039;s what the gov&amp;#039;t is doing!...only the libs are too blind to see it!....  700 billion being used to make the gov&amp;#039;t money. buy up Fannie and Freddie bonds for 20c on the dollar, sell them later, make 50% profit or more......by the hundreds of billions......  Obama is blind......   t.
