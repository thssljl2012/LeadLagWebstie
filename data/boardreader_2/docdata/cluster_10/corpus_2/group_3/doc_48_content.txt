The problem with the CDS market is that, hopefully you can follow me here, these banks/brokerages/etc own CDS against a lot of shit paper that they&amp;#039;ve already written down.  A lot of these CDS agreements are insured by AIG and other insurance companies, who may or may not be able to pay in event of a bond default So now we have this other huge asset class that may be worthless too.  Its complex shit and the only person that truly understands it is the geek that invented it.    Weve had several credit events that lead to the execution of CDS agreements over the past few months.  Lehmans failure, obviously, was one.  FNMA and FHLMC being placed into conservatorship was also considered an actionable credit event.  When this happens, the market does lock up but it is for a totally different reason than what is going on in the Commercial Paper (short-term funding) market.  It locks up because all the big boys are trying to figure out how to unwind all the CDS theyre tied into and really dont care about doing anything else at that point in time.    My coverage at Deutsche/Citi/Merrill have told me in the past that for the last 2 years 90+% of their business was CDS.  From a portfolio management perspective, if you have a certain maturity you need to fill and a lack of availablity of the particular bond you&amp;#039;d like to have.  You can use derivitives, such as CDS, to create a synthetic position to meet your needs.  You do not have to actually own the bond to buy a CDS for it, so that is how you can theoretically have $64t in contracts against $5t in paper.    It&amp;#039;s a fawkin mess.  But, the Treasury&amp;#039;s decision to buy CP is completely unrelated to the CDS market.  CDS and CP are no way related.  That&amp;#039;s a whole different can of worms.  I&amp;#039;m much more familiar with the CP markets than I am with the CDS arena, and would be happy to give you my .02 on the CP situation if you want.  I mainly use the CDS market as an early warning signal that the street thinks somebody&amp;#039;s in trouble.  When spreads on CDS start to widen, the smart money is on something bad happening to that particular company.  So, be mindful of GE!      You get mass confusion on Main Street when a reporter tries to explain something they know nothing about to MeeMaw and PawPaw who&amp;#039;ve never even heard the term &amp;amp;quot;Credit Default Swap&amp;amp;quot;.                      So it&amp;#039;s true.    Ask any fucking question about the stock market and it requires a fucking sixteen paragraph answer. It&amp;#039;s such bullshit. It&amp;#039;s all fake propped up overblown cryptic valueless paper or pieces of paper that claim other pieces of paper are equal to invisible future paper.    FUCK YOU ALL    Lunyou
