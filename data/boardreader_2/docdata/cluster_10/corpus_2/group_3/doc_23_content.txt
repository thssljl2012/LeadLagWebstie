 It seems like all this bail out is doing is keeping a a brain dead body on life support. They&amp;#039;ve used up more than 2/3rds in a month. When will it all be gone and then what happens?   I am guessing that this funding is being used by AIG to fund credit default swaps in which AIG sold insurance on now-defaulted paper like Washington Mutual and Lehman bonds.  What makes this situation really bad is that it seems to me that AIG will ultimately default on real insurance claims. What then, another bail out for the government owned AIG corporation?   Like I&amp;#039;ve been saying, we need to nationalize the major banks right now, or form a new congressional bank and issue a new currency pronto.   Financial companies borrow record amount from Fed   http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jC0Js_XMSCt-GDAijc3qIbjuVZIAD93IJJUG0   &amp;quot;...  For the week ending Wednesday, investment firms drew a record $147.7 billion. That was up significantly from $88.15 billion in the previous week. This category was broadened last week to include any loans that were made to the U.S. and London-based broker-dealer subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. On Wednesday alone, investment firms borrowed a record $146.6 billion, breaking the previous record set on Sept. 24.     The Fed report also showed that $122.1 billion worth of loans were made to money market mutual funds &amp;amp;#8212; via banks &amp;amp;#8212; to help the funds, which have been under pressure as skittish investors demand withdrawals.     And, the report showed that the Fed has loaned $61.3 billion to insurance giant American International Group. In mid-September, the Fed said it would provide the troubled company a two-year, $85 billion loan....&amp;quot;  So much for a two year loan. It looks like two months at this rate. I know they have two years to pay it back, but my question is &amp;quot;will they be around in two years?&amp;quot;
