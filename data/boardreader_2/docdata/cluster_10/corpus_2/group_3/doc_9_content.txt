 The Chairman of the FDIC has persuaded Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Wachovia to cease filing new lawsuite against each other for the next 48 hours. That request came after Citigroup filed a $60 billion suit against Wells and Wachovia.     Apparently the FDIC is trying to get Citi and Wells to work out a deal to split up Wachovia between them. Hmmm... We&amp;#039;ll see.     Here&amp;#039;s an interesting development: The Reserve Bank of Australia just cut interest rates 1%. I wonder if Bernanke will cut the fed funds rate and the discount rate tomorrow morning by a similar amount?     The bailout isn&amp;#039;t having much of an effect because Paulson isn&amp;#039;t going to start buying any crappy mortgages, etc., for at least six weeks! By that time, the world as we know it could come to an end -- at least that&amp;#039;s what well known loudmouth Jim Cramer is saying.
