 You have Fuld and the stormtroopers wearing the logo of Barclay&amp;#039;s Bank in the original cartoon.    (Barclay&amp;#039;s latest logo)  But although Barclays bought up most of Lehman Brothers&amp;#039;  assets  they did not buy Lehman Brothers,  the company . So, Dick Fuld does not work for Barclays in any way, shape, or form.   I&amp;#039;m not objecting your making a cartoon of him, I&amp;#039;m not objecting to you painting him as a bad guy, or any of that stuff. I&amp;#039;m just pointing out that he&amp;#039;s not a representative of Barclay&amp;#039;s bank as suggested in your cartoon. It&amp;#039;s like you put a BP logo on the jacket of someone who actually worked for Exxon but has never worked for BP.
