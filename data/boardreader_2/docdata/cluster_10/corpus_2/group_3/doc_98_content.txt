          Newsnight:  Barclays and RBS have 2.4trillion in CDS each. Worldwide cds market 60 trillion. Further defaults and deleveraging....................... writedowns of trillions................ beyond the capacity of the governments to bail out............... 2nd great depression. Could the writing really be on the wall?    FWIW I am just beginning to form the impression that the investing world has moved en masse into some surreal parallel universe in which the  only  thing that matters is the random thoughts of some extremely uninformed scribblers and broadcasters!  The CDS market issues are a case in point, as they have been grotesquely misreported. Yes there are certainly very large incipient problems in the CDS market - but I&amp;#039;m unconvinced that the real picture is anywhere near as gloomy as breathless journalists are seeking to paint it!!  I am still of the view that more financial institutions will go bust over the winter, thanks mainly to property lending but with some contribution from the CDS market. However, I&amp;#039;m also beginning to think that we may be coming out of the woods now re the systemic problems, despite the fact that these have been far worse than even I expected......  ....accordingly I think there is a rising risk of overshooting on the downside, before jouralists and other commentators  finally  get their heads around where the remaining risks lie........  .....and I would therefore not rule out moving some of my pension money out of cash and into shares at some point this year - rather earlier than I would have expected, thanks to what looks like excessive and (recently - ie the last few days only) unjustified uberbearishness in the press that appears to have whipped up an impression amongst fairly ordinary people that the market is now a one-way down bet.  ee
