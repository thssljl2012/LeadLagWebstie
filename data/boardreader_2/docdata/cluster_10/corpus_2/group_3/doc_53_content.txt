The second is its hold to maturity price (If you hold onto it and collect interest and get money back at maturity, and discount the sum of those future cash flows to their present value than what number is that)  The third is the market price (If you examine current market conditions, and take your time, sell it for a reasonable price what should that number be.)                      If these bonds are held to maturity, who is supposed to pay them off and how? In normal bonds the issuer pays, either through assets or by rolling them over. Are the mortgages that back them all supposed to be paid off by then or does the issuer just pay? Would there be a danger that the mature prices was not realistic if there was a significant default rate for the underlying mortgages?    Or would this be handled by insurance from AIG?
