I could call you an antisemite in  every  one of my posts, and I&amp;#039;d be right every time!         Quote:                         We are talking here about AIG.  AIG had an FDIC-insured banking subsidiary.  That was the ONLY portion of AIG that taxpayers were on the hook for.                     Bullshit - AIG owned AGF with $29 billion in mortgage-backed investments, as well as AIG Financial Products. Failure of mortgage-backed investment = failure of banks holding the mortgages.    Note that the FDIC fund only holds $50 billion or so against several trillion dollars of insured funds. The claim was that AIG&amp;#039;s failure would put undue pressure on the deposit insurance fund, not that it would bankrupt it.
