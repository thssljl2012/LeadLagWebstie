 OSTK Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              Re: Credit Default Swaps ???  Hedge Funds will make billions on the collapse of LEH, FRE, FNM, etc.     Q. Fairfax made its windfall buying credit default swaps (protection on bond defaults) then cashed in. Aren&amp;#039;t these swaps sinking many financial institutions who bet the other way? How does this work?    A. &amp;quot;We paid $425 million and bet on credit spreads involving $22 billion over time. We could have lost up to $425 million if our bet was wrong, but those who wrote [sold] these, if they were wrong, could lose the entire $22 billion.&amp;quot;       Q. Aren&amp;#039;t the derivatives, or swaps, what sank Wall Street and AIG?    A. &amp;quot;AIG wrote US$450 billion in credit default swaps [in its London office] without any capital or reserves behind these [potential losses of $23 billion] unlike the rest of its insurance business. Rating agencies accepted these. The employees got one-third of profits and 400 [in this swaps division] made an average of US$1 million a year. Derivatives were insurance without anything behind them.&amp;quot;   &amp;quot;This affected Wall Street because AIG then laid off this risk with Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. The others disappeared for the same reason.&amp;quot;          http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/francis/archive/2008/10/01/wall-street-survival-strategy-101.aspx       &amp;amp;nbsp;    Thanks to panglozz earlier on this board            thread start
