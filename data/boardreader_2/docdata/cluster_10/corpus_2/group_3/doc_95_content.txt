         Newsnight:  Barclays and RBS have 2.4trillion in CDS each. Worldwide cds market 60 trillion. Further defaults and deleveraging....................... writedowns of trillions................ beyond the capacity of the governments to bail out............... 2nd great depression. Could the writing really be on the wall?  On a light note I just invested my monthly drip and collected divis in KAZ, its adds another sector and looks very good on historic earnings and yields 8% (dont laugh its all ive got to go on!) As Dreman said you have to don your helmet and march into the valley of death trouble is I dont know whether I will come out the other side lol.
