  GM in Preliminary Talks With Chrysler, Person Says           By Jeff Green        Oct. 11 (Bloomberg) -- General Motors Corp. is in preliminary talks with Cerberus Capital Management LP&amp;#039;s Chrysler LLC about a possible merger or other partnership, a person familiar with the talks said.        The talks are very early and it&amp;#039;s not clear whether they will result in any agreement, said the person, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. The New York Times reported the talks yesterday and said Cerberus is also holding talks with automakers including Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA, citing unidentified people.        GM, which hasn&amp;#039;t made money since 2004, and Chrysler, which has said it won&amp;#039;t be profitable this year, are under pressure to cut costs and increase liquidity as U.S. auto sales have fallen to the lowest since 1991 and the credit crunch, touched off by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holding Holdings Inc., is making it harder for customers and dealers to get loans.        Cerberus spokesman Peter Duda did not return phone calls. Chrysler spokeswoman Shawn Morgan had no immediate comment. GM spokesman Tony Cervone also had no comment, and Renault spokeswoman Nathalie Bourotte declined to comment.        A combination of GM, which sold 9.4 million units last year, and Chrysler, with 2.7 million, would cement GM&amp;#039;s lead over Toyota Motor Corp. as the world&amp;#039;s largest automaker. GM beat Toyota by only about 3,000 cars and trucks last year and Toyota led by 278,000 in the first half of this year.        Sales Decline        GM&amp;#039;s U.S. sales fell 18 percent in the first nine months of this year and Chrysler&amp;#039;s sales have declined 25 percent in its home market. Both automakers are losing sales as first rising fuel prices and then a credit crunch have curtailed demand.        Shares of Detroit-based GM have tumbled 80 percent this year, valuing the company at $2.8 billion. GM rose 13 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $4.89 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, its first advance since Sept. 30. Chrysler, the No. 3 U.S.-based automaker, is closely held.        New York-based Cerberus said last month that it was trying to buy the 19.9 percent of Chrysler that is still owned by Daimler AG. Daimler wrote down the value of its Chrysler stake at the end of June to 171 million euros ($230 million) from 916 million euros at the end of 2007 as the automaker&amp;#039;s fortunes declined.        Unprofitable        Chrysler said Sept. 25 it will fire about 250 employees as part of a plan to eliminate 1,000 salaried positions by the end of last month. Chrysler said in August that it is trying to sell its Viper sports car brand.        Chrysler, which isn&amp;#039;t required to report financial information, has said it won&amp;#039;t be profitable in 2008. The company said that through June, it earned $1.1 billion before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.        GM and Chrysler also discussed a merger in 2007, people familiar with those talks said at the time. Daimler Chief Executive Officer Dieter Zetsche confirmed in March of that year that the two automakers were in talks about developing models together. Daimler instead sold the majority of the company to Cerberus.        Chrysler already assembles minivans for Germany&amp;#039;s Volkswagen AG in Canada and is scheduled to build a pickup for Nissan Motor Co. in 2011. Chrysler said in August that it had preliminary talks with Fiat SpA about building vehicles in North America for the Italian carmaker. Chrysler has also announced plans for sedans developed with Nissan and China&amp;#039;s Chery Automobile Co.        Demand for Cash        Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s analyst Robert Schulz said yesterday that GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler may be forced into bankruptcy as the global credit freeze damps U.S. sales.        ``Macro factors could overwhelm them at some point&amp;#039;&amp;#039; even as GM, Ford and Chrysler vow to stick with their turnaround plans, Schulz, S&amp;amp;amp;P&amp;#039;s lead automotive credit analyst, said yesterday in a Bloomberg Television interview in New York. The companies said they have no plans to seek bankruptcy protection.        With all three companies working to boost cash, any bankruptcy filing would be a last resort, not a ``strategic&amp;#039;&amp;#039; decision, Schulz said.        ``We don&amp;#039;t see that as something they would choose,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said. Schulz said the ``trigger&amp;#039;&amp;#039; for a forced restructuring under bankruptcy protection would be based on the automakers&amp;#039; ability to preserve liquidity as sales decline. Industrywide U.S. sales slid 27 percent last month, the most in 17 years.        Sumitomo Corp. and Tata Motors Ltd. are among the potential buyers for shares in Mazda Motor Corp. that Ford is trying to sell, Nikkei English News today reported, without saying where it obtained information.        Mazda Stake        Ford, which owns a third of the Japanese automaker, is considering selling some of those shares to raise funds, Nikkei said. A Mazda executive acknowledged the company is preparing for a potential sale by Ford, Nikkei said, adding that Japanese competitors are unlikely to buy the shares.        State-run broadcaster NHK earlier reported that Ford asked Japanese companies to buy Mazda shares from it.        Mazda has nothing to announce, according to a statement the carmaker released in Tokyo today. Ford&amp;#039;s relationship with Mazda ``hasn&amp;#039;t changed,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Ford spokesman Mark Truby said in an e-mailed comment today. The company doesn&amp;#039;t comment on speculation, he said.        Ford dropped 9 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $1.99 yesterday, its lowest since Oct. 5, 1982. The stock has declined 70 percent this year, valuing the company at $4.5 billion.        Operating-cash needs at GM, Ford and Chrysler are ``substantial, so if it looked like they were going to be pushing toward that number because of these operating losses and cash usage, that&amp;#039;s sort of the point where they&amp;#039;d have to consider&amp;#039;&amp;#039; bankruptcy, Schulz said.        `Serious Challenge&amp;#039;        S&amp;amp;amp;P said that Oct. 9 its debt ratings for GM and Ford, already at six steps below investment grade at B-, may be lowered again because the automakers face a ``serious challenge&amp;#039;&amp;#039; in 2009.        Barclays Capital reduced its target stock price for GM to $4 yesterday, with analyst Brian Johnson in Chicago citing dwindling global auto demand.        ``With auto sales stalled in the U.S. and beginning to contract in the rest of the world, we believe GM&amp;#039;s cash needs are increasing,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Johnson wrote in a note. ``Moreover, the downside risk of greater decline in worldwide auto sales driving greater cash needs is increasing.&amp;#039;&amp;#039; _________________ _________                           People Fighting Back              Nader for President 2008
