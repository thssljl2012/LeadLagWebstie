 I know plenty about heraldry - after all I grew up a few miles from medieval castle. But you&amp;#039;re not just using any spread eagle there, rather a symbol associated with a specific bank.   I&amp;#039;m coming to the conclusion, given your &amp;quot;he is now working for Darth Diamond&amp;quot; comment, that you misunderstood what Fuld&amp;#039;s situation was. Because if by &amp;#039;Darth Diamond&amp;#039; you meant Robert Diamond, who is head of Barclays&amp;#039; US operations, Fuld is not working for him at all. Either he winds up Lehman Brothers completely, or if he somehow manages to resurrect it as a much smaller company, then he&amp;#039;ll be the head of that. Barclays have taken over Lehmans&amp;#039; flagship building, but Fuld is already out of there - he&amp;#039;s now working in rented space in the Time-Life building.   http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2008/10/01/exile-for-lehman-...  /
