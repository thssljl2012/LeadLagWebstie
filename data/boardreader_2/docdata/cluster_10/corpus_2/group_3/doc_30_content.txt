          I was sent this and thought some of you might find it interesting. Of course, I don&amp;#039;t know if the facts are accurate.   I think the story is essentially true, but it exaggerates to role of AIG.  AIG wasn&amp;#039;t the only insurance company selling them.  Furthermore, since they aren&amp;#039;t technically insurance policies, any financial company could sell them, and they all did.  Imagine Lehman insuring its subprime mortgages by buying CDS&amp;#039;s from Goldman Sachs, and Goldman insuring its own subprime mortgages by buying CDS&amp;#039;s from Lehman.  What do you get?  A classic Ponzi scheme.  Elan
