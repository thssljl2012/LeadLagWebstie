                 60 Minutes ran a special Sunday...               &amp;amp;quot;They already dwarf what has been lost on those original risky mortgages. As bad as the mortgage crisis has been, 94 percent of all Americans are still paying off their loans. The problem is Wall Street placed its huge bets and side bets with all of those fancy securities on the 6 percent who are not.       &amp;amp;quot;We wouldn&amp;#039;t be in any of this trouble right now if we had just had underlying investments in mortgages. We wouldn&amp;#039;t be in any trouble right now,&amp;amp;quot; says Partnoy.       He says it&amp;amp;#8217;s the side bets.       &amp;amp;quot;You got Wall Street firms, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers. You got insurance companies like AIG. Merrill lost a ton of money on this,&amp;amp;quot; Kroft says. &amp;amp;quot;Everybody&amp;#039;s lost a ton of money. They&amp;#039;re supposed to be the smartest investors in the world. And they did it themselves.&amp;amp;quot;           A Look At Wall Street&amp;#039;s Shadow Market, 60 Minutes: How Some Arcane Wall Street Financial Instruments Magnified Economic Crisis - CBS News                                         The US had already been down this road and outlawed what we now call Credit Default Sawps.             &amp;amp;quot;Bucket shop is a brokerage firm that &amp;amp;#8220;books&amp;amp;quot; (i.e., takes the opposite side of) retail customer orders without actually having them executed on an exchange.[1] These brokerages are also often called boiler rooms. The term is a defined term under the criminal law of many states in the United States which make it a crime to operate a bucket shop. [2] Typically the criminal law definition refers to an operation in which the customer is sold what is supposed to be a derivative interest in a security or commodity future, but there is no transaction made on any exchange. The transaction goes &amp;#039;in the bucket&amp;#039; and is never executed. Without an actual underlying transaction, the customer is betting against the bucket shop operator, not participating in the market. Operating a bucket shop would also likely involve violations of several provisions of US federal securities or commodity futures laws[3].&amp;amp;quot;           http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_shop_(stock_market )          &amp;amp;quot;The result is a huge shadow market that may control our financial destiny, and yet the details of these private insurance contracts are hidden from the public, from stockholders and federal regulators. No one knows what they cover, who owns them, and whether or not they have the money to pay them off.       One of the few sources of information is the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), a trade organization made up the largest financial institutions in the world. Many of them are the very same companies that created the vast shadow market, lobbied to keep it unregulated, and are now drowning because of unanticipated risks.        They are private and largely undisclosed contracts that mortgage investors entered into to protect themselves against losses if the investments went bad. And they are part of a huge unregulated market that has already helped bring down three of the largest firms on Wall Street, and still threaten the ones that are left.          But when homeowners began defaulting on their mortgages, and Wall Street&amp;#039;s high-risk mortgage backed securities also began to fail, the big investment houses and insurance companies who sold the credit default swaps hadn&amp;#039;t set aside the money they needed to pay off their obligations.       Bear Stearns was the first to go under, selling itself to J.P. Morgan for pennies on the dollar. Then, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. And when AIG, the nation&amp;#039;s largest insurer, couldn&amp;#039;t cover its bad debts, the government stepped in with an $85 billion rescue.       Asked what role the credit default swaps play in this financial disaster, Frank Partnoy tells Kroft, &amp;amp;quot;They were the centerpiece, really. That&amp;#039;s why the banks lost all the money. They lost all the money based on those side bets, based on the mortgages.&amp;amp;quot;         http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/...54_page2.shtml                                                                                      Last edited by LukeO; 10-28-08 at  06:59 AM .
