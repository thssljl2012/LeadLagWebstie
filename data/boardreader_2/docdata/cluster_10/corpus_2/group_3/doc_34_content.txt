  The over-the-counter market for the swaps has provided a &amp;quot;significant opportunity&amp;quot; for market manipulation, Cox said Wednesday.  The SEC last month began a sweeping investigation of the market, looking at whether investors used credit default swaps to illegally profit from sharp declines in stocks of financial companies.  A three-week-old SEC ban against short selling in stocks of nearly 1,000 financial companies -- betting that the share prices would fall -- expires at midnight Wednesday.  Members of a House panel on Tuesday accused AIG, the world&amp;#039;s largest insurance company, of opening &amp;quot;a casino in London&amp;quot; when it began dealing in credit default swaps. The Federal Reserve came to AIG&amp;#039;s rescue last month with an $85 billion line of credit, and the company already has tapped it for $61 billion.  The sheer volume of credit default swaps sold by AIG, coupled with rising levels of defaulted mortgage and other debt, threatened the company&amp;#039;s existence and forced the government to bail it out to avoid a catastrophic collapse. If AIG were to fail, the losses would spread to the companies and investors who bought swaps from it.    (same source as above)
