Dear Friends            If youre looking to point blame somewhere for todays financial crisis, theres plenty of options.        Blame former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who responded to the dot-com bust by lowering interest rates, and in effect, creating a subsidy for debt and a bubble in the real estate market.        Or blame the people who had no business taking out mortgages but enthusiastically signed the contract.        Or blame the profit minded lenders who lowered their standards enough to make the loans.        Even better, blame the SEC, which in 2004 gave special exemption to five firms, Merrill Lynch, Bears &amp;amp;amp; Stearns, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers, allowing them to more then double the leverage they were allowed to keep on their balance sheets.        Three of the firms no longer exist.        Whats particularly troubling is that the red flags should have gone up much sooner.        You see, since the dot-com bubble burst in 2001, the United States has been wired in its weakest period of GDP growth then any stretch since the 1950s.  But mysteriously, the bottom lines of banks (through 2007) managed to defy gravity.        Profits, which once accounted for only 10% of the countrys corporate profit pie, swelled to an incredible 40% chunk.        Of course, we now know that banks were stock piling dept instruments and wildly trading them in their own accounts for big-time profits.  Perhaps the most glaring example, and the latest arcane investment sprung on us, is credit default swaps (CDS).        But much like sub-prime mortgages and collateralized dept obligations, most investors know little about them.        Lets take a closer look at these toxic innovations wrecking havoc on Wall Street.  And more importantly, take measures to insulate portfolios from any future financial weapons of mass destruction as Warren Buffet affectionately calls them.            Page 1 of 3        The CDS Death Spiral: A credit default swap is a form of insurance, intended to cover losses to banks and bond-holders when companies fail to pay their debts.        At their core, they function much like a simple homeowners policy that protects against losses from fire and theft.  The buyer (traditionally a bondholder) pays a premium to a seller, in exchange for a promise to cover losses in the event of a credit default.        But in a blink of any eye, Wall Street exploited their simplicity and turned the market for these derivatives into a  $54 Trillion Dollar casing.        Risk speculators (Investment Banks, Insurance Companies, Hedge Funds) who wanted exposure to certain asset classes, various bonds and loans, or security pools such as residential and commercial mortgages, backed securities, but didnt want to own them, now had the means by which to speculate on them.        And speculate they did.        Born out of easy credit terms and losses lending standards, the CDS market exploded, increasing 100 fold over the last seven years.  In 2000, the CDS market was valued at 900 Billion dollars.  Today, data from International and Derivatives Swaps Association tells us it rests at $54.6 Trillion.        Thats bigger then the Stock Market, Treasuries Market and Mortgage Market combined.        So given the size of the market, and the distances effects the failure of this market would have on the economy, why didnt regulations stop the madness?        Because there arent any regulations!!! The CDS market is completely unregulated.  No standard contracts exist.  They arent traded on exchanges.        Nobody guarantees them: No capital requirements are in place.  And no self-regulatory body exists to police them.        Putting a price tag on the unknown.  The incredible volatility youre seeing in stocks and the credit market goes hand in hand with whats happening in the CDS market.  The Fed was forced to rescue Bear Sterns to ensure the Trillions of dollars of credit default swaps on its books wouldnt be wiped out.        Ditto for AIG: There wasnt a thing wrong with AIGs insurance business.  It just couldnt resist dabbling in the CDS market to a tune of about $441 Billion Dollars worth of swaps on corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities.  When the portfolios value plummeted. AIG got caught with its pants down.        Page 2 of 3        And again, the Fed was forced to either bail out the insurance giant or let it default on the credit swaps.  The latter would have catastrophic effects on the whole financial markets.        As far a Lehman goes, the Fed felt that the markets were more prepared for its failure, thus chose not to intervene.        What makes this mess so difficult to sort out, however, is that we cant punch in a ticker symbol on Yahoo!! Finance and get a fair market price of CDS.  So assigning any kind of value becomes a highly subjective process.        Making matters worse, CDS contracts trade freely in the Secondary market, too.  Each contract can go through 15 to 24 trades, creating a virtual spider web of counterparty risk.        Such opaqueness makes it impossible to know:    1. The impact that a single bankruptcy may have no one knew of Bear Stearns $13 Trillion Dollars counterparty risk until it collapsed, or    2. how to accurately reflect this uncertainty into prices.        Not to mention, the rampant speculation all but assures us that the parties holding CDS insurance havent the financial might to pay in the event of mass defaults.        Add it all up, the enormity, the lack of regulation, the uncertainty over prices and credit worthiness, and the Feds intervention was justified.        When innovation outpaces regulation Caveat Emptor.  Its easy to point fingers.  Call for greater regulation, or put the onus on someone else (like the government) to protect us from future greed driven financial over-speculation. Fact is, it will never be enough.        Sadly greed is too powerful a vice.  And the CDS crisis again proves financial innovation will always outpace regulation.        Against that backdrop, the best way for all of us to protect ourselves is to be leery of the next speculative innovation because it will likely be rigged in the favor of the home team WALL STREET.        My advice is, stick to investing in what you fully understand, sound companies with consistently good earnings.  If you look back through history, you wont find a single company that increased its earnings quarter after quarter, year after year, and the stock didnt tag along.        In the end, companies like these, are the only defense one has during times of crisis.
