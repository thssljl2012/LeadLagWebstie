  First of all: I don&amp;#039;t know. The complexity of CDO&amp;#039;s are such that, no matter how often I read the articles, I can&amp;#039;t get a good grasp on what exactly is happening.   ICAN say:   1. You don&amp;#039;t own CDO&amp;#039;s. You own corporate bonds.   2. The corporate bonds you own are  probably  &amp;#039;involved&amp;#039; in theCDO&amp;#039;s being talked about.   What does &amp;#039;involved&amp;#039; mean?   I refer you to an article on CDO&amp;#039;s:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateralized_debt_obligation    and in particular a paragraph which says:    Cash CDOs involve a portfolio of cash assets, such as loans,  corporate bonds , asset-backed securities or mortgage-backed securities. Ownership of the assets is transferred to the legal entity (known as a special purpose vehicle) issuing the CDO&amp;#039;s tranches. The risk of loss on the assets is divided among tranches in reverse order of seniority. Cash CDO issuance exceeded $400 billion in 2006.        So it is likely that the  market value (i.e. theprice at which you can sell the bonds) of the bonds you hold will be altered when this auction takes place even though the bonds themselves are not directly involved.      As to the likelihood that your bonds are called I would say it is slight. The reason is that calling bonds requires the outlay of the face value of the bonds. With the current severe cash crises I don&amp;#039;t think the companies will want to call bonds if they can avoid it. They don&amp;#039;t have the cash to spend.      I DO anticipate that theissuing companiesat some pointwill offer to call the bonds at a  reduction  to face value. i.e. they may offer you, as an example, 40% of face value to get the bonds off their books and improve their balance sheet. Some bond holders will take the offer thinking something is better than nothing.      The reference to &amp;quot;payments on Lehman Bonds&amp;quot; refers, in this instance, to the CDO&amp;#039;s on Lehman Bonds not the bonds themselves. i.e. some institutions (not individual investors) had bought &amp;#039;insurance&amp;#039; on Lehman bonds in the form of CDO&amp;#039;s. That insurance calls for payments to be made in the event the value of the bonds themselves has fallen by a certain amount. These institutions are now expecting the issuers of the CDO&amp;#039;s to pay off on their insurance. This is the 350 billion that is talked about. The issuers may not have the 350 billion to pay off the CDO&amp;#039;s. If this is the case there will be another crises in the making since the companies that issued the insurance (e.g. AIG) may be forced into bankruptcy if they cannot make the payments.      This is a horrible situation which is going to take years to resolve.
