 HANS Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 6              OT: How AIG&amp;#039;s Collapse Began A Global Run    Board:    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Heading out of town but thought I would post this before I go . . .    &amp;amp;nbsp;    One of my subscriptions is to Porter Stansberry&amp;#039;s Investment Advisory . . . an excellent service for those such as me that do not have enough time to dedicate to doing research, charts etc. (at least not as much time as I wish).    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Porter&amp;#039;s October issue was received last evening.&amp;amp;nbsp; In it, he discusses the AIG collapse with particular clarity, the likes of which I have not seen . . . a brief summary follows.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Essentially, the banks must comply with Basel II.&amp;amp;nbsp; These regulations determine how much capital a bank must maintain in its reserves based upon the quality of the bank&amp;#039;s loans.&amp;amp;nbsp; In its infinite wisdom, AIG found a way to circumvent the rules by offering &amp;quot;credit default swaps&amp;quot;.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Assume you are a swiss bank and you have a surplus of deposits.&amp;amp;nbsp; You&amp;#039;re looking to maximize the spread between what you pay on the deposits versus what rate you&amp;#039;re able to lend.&amp;amp;nbsp; You want something safe but also, obtain the highest possible yield.&amp;amp;nbsp; So, you call AIG and inquire as to what it would cost to insure the subprime security.&amp;amp;nbsp; The broker sells you a five year policy insuring at 2% of the face value (the broker gets paid an annual bonus on the policy).&amp;amp;nbsp; This credit default swap is essentially an insurance contract  but is not regulated .&amp;amp;nbsp; As such, AIG did not have to put up any collateral as long as it maintained a triple-A credit rating.&amp;amp;nbsp; Thanks to mark-to-market accounting principles, AIG was able to credit the profit from the five-year credit swap  at the time of sale .&amp;amp;nbsp; This profit was based upon computer models which turned out to be wrong.&amp;amp;nbsp;     &amp;amp;nbsp;    As a result of these actions, the Swiss bank could assure the regulators that it was holding only triple-A credits and therefore, was allowed to leverage itself to the fullest extent possible under the Basel regulations.&amp;amp;nbsp; Meanwhile, AIG could book hundred of millions of dollars in &amp;quot;profit&amp;quot; without having to allocate billions of dollars in collateral.&amp;amp;nbsp; [Unfortunately, some of these triple-A securities the banks were claiming turned out to be worth less than .15 per dollar.]    &amp;amp;nbsp;    On September 15, all of the major credit-rating agencies downgraded AIG from triple-A thus requiring collateral.&amp;amp;nbsp; The initial write down on these losses was reported in the fourth quarter of 11 billion dollars.&amp;amp;nbsp; The losses kept coming and AIG filed for bankruptcy followed by Lehman on the same day.&amp;amp;nbsp; What a lot of people do not know is that Goldman Sachs (GS) was AIG&amp;#039;s largest trading partner.&amp;amp;nbsp; As a result, the moment AIG went bankrupt, GS lost $20 billion.&amp;amp;nbsp; Goldman sought help from Warren Buffet with an infusion of $5 billion in capital and raised another $5 billion in a public offering.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    In order to save the banks, the $700 billion bailout allowed the Fed to change the rules and accept equity as collateral rather than cash.&amp;amp;nbsp; Also, we, the taxpayers, are now paying interest to these banks on the equities that the fed is holding as collateral as a way to infuse cash into these financial institutions.    &amp;amp;nbsp;

   I call this to your attention to note that the carnage&amp;amp;nbsp;may not be over for GS.&amp;amp;nbsp; Interestingly, they announced today, I believe, that they are cutting 10% of their work force.&amp;amp;nbsp;     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Some on this board trade GS . . . be careful.&amp;amp;nbsp; Do your own d.d.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Have a MoN$tEr Day . . .    &amp;amp;nbsp;    LvS    &amp;amp;nbsp;    And with due respect to Paul Harvey . . . now you know the rest of the story&amp;amp;nbsp;
