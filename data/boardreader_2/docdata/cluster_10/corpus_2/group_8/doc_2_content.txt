       Here's a surprise... not.   Merrill Lynch Says It Discovered Irregularity in Trading Unit    -- Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the securities firm acquired by Bank of America Corp., said it uncovered an irregularity during a review of its trading operations.  The bank informed regulators immediately of the discrepancy in certain trading positions, Merrill Lynch said in a statement from London today. The bank said its working with the authorities to investigate further.  Merrill Lynch may have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on currency trading and credit derivatives last year, the New York Times reported earlier today. The losses did not spill into plain view until after Bank of America investors had approved the takeover in December and Merrill Lynch disbursed $3.6 billion in bonuses to bankers, the newspaper said.  Senior managers of the business are focused on the issue and believe the risks surrounding possible losses are under control, Merrill said in the statement.  Three weeks ago, risk officers discovered that a London currency trader who had recorded a trading profit of $120 million for the fourth quarter may instead have lost a large amount, the New York Times said, citing an unidentified Bank of America executive.  The newspaper identified the employee as Alexis Stenfors, 38. He told the New York Times the matter was a misunderstanding and is co-operating with the probe. He remains a Merrill Lynch employee. Calls to his office in London from Bloomberg News werent answered.  Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, posted its first loss since 1991 in January and cut the dividend to a penny after receiving $138 billion in emergency government funds to support the Merrill takeover. Profit for 2008 fell to $4.01 billion from $14.98 billion. The bank is cutting as many as 35,000 jobs to reduce annual costs by about $7 billion.   http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aGbSx7rY_DYU&amp;refer=home   Jim
