  Bank of America said revealing the data could help rivals poach talent, prompt employees to leave because their privacy was violated, cause "internal dissension and consternation," increase security risks for bonus recipients, and give rivals a better idea of which businesses it considers most valuable.       Bank of America sees grave harm from bonus reveal   Reuters      Interesting. The company I work for has something similiar written into one of the "non-compete" forms we sign. Basically, if you tell anyone how much you make, and it's accurate and they report you, you can be terminated. Discussing how much you make tends to cause disruption. It can also cause envy or anger, I'd imagine. Perhaps both at the same time. It also gives away information to our competitors, who can make a better deal based on that information. Really, not a heck of lot different than contract bids.      Hrmmm......lawyers are SMART&gt;
