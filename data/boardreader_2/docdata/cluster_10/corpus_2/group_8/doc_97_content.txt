                                                                                             Merrill Lynch says it had discovered "trading irregularities" in its London accounts that         media reports say total several hundred milliondollars in undisclosed losses.                             The company revealed it wasconducting an investigation following a report in The New York Timesnewspaper Friday that a London-based Merrill employee,         Alexis Stenfors,was stripped of his trading authority last month after losing more than$120 million.                             Other traders may have lost hundreds of millions more on the derivatives markets.                             The company said in a statement Friday that it informed British regulators immediately after finding discrepancies in "certain trading         positions"and that the "risks surrounding possible losses are under control."                             The losses came ahead of the investment firm's takeover by Bank of America.                             Bankof America shareholders approved the merger of the two companies onDecember 5, unaware that Merrill's pending losses for the fourthquarter of         2008 would total $13.3 billion.                             The new allegations -and the timing of their disclosure - will further add to thecontroversy surrounding Merrill's payment of $3.6 billion in         bonuses toits executives just before the Bank of America deal was sealed.                             When the extent of Merrill Lynch's financial problems became clear, Bank of America was forced to ask for a second government bailout to cover         itsabsorbed losses in connection with the merger. It has accepted $45billion in government aid since October.
