 CWEI Message Board Posts          Recs: 3              Banks = no equity YeeHaw    I have always had the suspicion that Wells Fargo's ( WFC ) loan values were  inflated and wrote as much in January .  Wells sits at ground zero of the housing implosion and the fact that  their numbers held up so well was a mystery...unless they were very  slow to take write downs for bad loans. The company's own 10-K reveals  that my suspicion was correct. Numerous banks are equity deficient  which explains the continued weakness in the stocks.    According to  Jonathan Weil at Bloomberg ,       Perhaps  never before have so many banks balance sheets been so patently full  of hot air. Bank of America Corp. last week disclosed that its loans at  the end of 2008 were worth $44.6 billion less than what its balance  sheet said.       Investors may be placing too much  faith in bank's capital ratios. If the bank's own estimates of fair  value were applied to the company's balance sheet the banks would be  technically insolvent. Weil continues:       Bank  of America, for instance, had $35.8 billion of tangible common equity  as of Dec. 31, before it completed its government-aided acquisition of  Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. That figure falls to negative $1.7 billion once  its adjusted so that all financial assets and liabilities are measured  at fair value, using the numbers BofA disclosed in its footnote. The  fair-value version shows BofA needs lots more common equity -- badly.    Wells  Fargos tangible common equity was $13.5 billion as of Dec. 31. On a  fair-value basis, it was negative $133 million. That makes the banks  $40.9 billion stock-market capitalization look awfully rich.    In  total, eight of the 24 banks in the KBW Bank Index had negative  tangible common equity on a fair-value basis, including SunTrust,  KeyCorp, Fifth Third Bancorp, Huntington Bancshares Inc., Marshall  &amp; Ilsley Corp. and Regions Financial Corp.       This  indicates to me that these companies will soon be back at the  government's teat to get more capital injections, further diluting  current shareholders.   http://seekingalpha.com/article/124335-bofa-wells-fargo-no-equity-after-accounting-for-bad-loans?source=front_page_most_popular_articles
