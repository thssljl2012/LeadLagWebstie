Hi David,      The US Treasury, after the Lehman bankruptcy, drew a line in the sand at the G20 Meeting and Declaration on Nov 15, 2008, see: www.jcbcapital.com/g20.htm      Unless the Obama administration changes policy - Banks/AIG that have already received billions of EESA/TARP money may already be deemed too big to fail - they are already recognized as posing global systemic risks. See fixes: www.jcbcapital.com/2008panic.htm      Personally, I think it is unlikely that Congress will nationalize financial institutions - but I could be wrong. The Treasury now owns 36% of Citigroup. Even in the case of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG the Treasury only owns 79.9%.      Geitner and a White house spokepersons continue to repeat that nationalization is not the first choice.
