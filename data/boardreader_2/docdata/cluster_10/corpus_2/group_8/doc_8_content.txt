       Losses at Merrill Lynch could reach several hundred million dollars as inquiry into 'trading irregularities' launched         March 7, 2009 - http://www.timesonline.co.uk/      A trader working for an American investment bank in London has been suspended in an inquiry into "trading irregularities" with losses that could reach several hundred million dollars.      Alexis Stenfors, a currency investor at Merrill Lynch, was stripped of his authority to trade last month after the discovery during a review of its British operations.      Merrill Lynch, which was bought recently by Bank of America, suspended Mr Stenfors, 38, after an examination of his trading book three weeks ago when he was on a skiing holiday.      He joined Merrill Lynch in 1995 after four years at Calyon, the investment banking arm of Crdit Agricole.      There are fears within the bank that it has incurred losses of at least $120 million (85 million) on bets against fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies that went wrong. The extent of its losses have yet to be calculated. Merrill Lynch declined to comment on whether Mr Stenfors is at the centre of the irregularity.      The group said that it had informed regulators immediately of the discrepancy in "certain trading positions".      Mr Stenfors was stripped of his authority to trade on February 25, after Merrill Lynch discovered the discrepancies in his trades, although he remains an employee of the group.      Mr Stenfors could not be contacted yesterday. However,  The New York Times quoted him as saying on Thursday that the matter amounted to a "misunderstanding" and he is cooperating with the investigation.      Mr Stenfors is understood to have recorded a $120million trading profit for the fourth quarter of last year, but is thought to have made a loss at least as big.      Merrill Lynch said: "During a recent evaluation of certain trading positions, we discovered an irregularity. We informed regulators immediately and are working closely with authorities to thoroughly investigate the matter. Senior managers of the business are focused on the issue and believe the risks surrounding possible losses are under control."      Mr Stenfors's alleged losses will fuel the controversy surrounding Merrill Lynch's payment of $3.6 billion in staff bonuses, based on estimates of the bank's performance that were made on December 8 - three days after it was bought by Bank of America. Soon afterwards, Merrill Lynch reported a much larger than expected loss of $13.8 billion for the last three months of 2008.   On Wednesday Andrew Cuomo, the New York attorney-general, issued subpoenas for seven Merrill Lynch executives who allegedly scooped tens of millions of dollars in bonuses even as the bank racked up its huge losses
