           Advertisements [ ? ]                          March 3 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. managed to generate $5 billion in profit during the worst year in Wall Street history by trading over-the-counter fixed-income derivatives, two people with knowledge of the results said.   The largest U.S. bank by market value, which reported $5.6 billion of total profit in 2008, hasnt disclosed earnings for its interest-rate swap, municipal bond and foreign exchange derivatives group. The unit was among the most profitable at the New York-based company, said the people, who declined to be identified because they werent authorized to divulge the figures. JPMorgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau declined to comment.   The JPMorgan trading desk, led by the 38-year-old Matt Zames, who previously worked at hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management LP, may have benefited as the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and JPMorgans takeover of Bear Stearns Cos. left companies and hedge funds with fewer trading partners in the private derivatives markets. JPMorgan emerged unscathed by the disasters on Wall Street and positioned to capture more revenue as trading volumes grew, said Craig Pirrong, a finance professor at the University of Houston.   Its a flight to quality, Pirrong said. They expanded the scale of business, the number of trades people wanted to do with them, and it gave them pricing power.   Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset such as stocks, commodities or interest rates. Over-the-counter refers to a type of private, unregulated derivative contract banks trade amongst themselves or with clients.
