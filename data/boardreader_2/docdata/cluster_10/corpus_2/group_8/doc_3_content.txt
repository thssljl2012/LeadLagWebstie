   Merrill Lynch is working with the authorities to investigate the activities of a possible rogue currency trader in London.    In a statement, the bank, which was saved from collapse last year when it was bought by Bank of America, said it had discovered an irregularity during checks on some currency positions in the City.    It said senior managers in the business were "focused on the issue" and that further risks were under control.    The comment from the bank followed  a report in the New York Times naming the trader as Alexis Stenfors , 38, who is still an employee at Merrill Lynch. Stenfors told the New York Times that the issue was a "misunderstanding", and his lawyer, Ian Ryan, said he was co-operating with the investigation. The report suggested he had gambled away $120m of the bank's money.    Merrill lost $13.8bn in the final three months of last year alone. It was forced into the arms of Bank of America in a hastily cobbled together deal over a weekend in September when it became clear the bank was likely to share the fate of the now-defunct Lehman Brothers.    Bank of America bosses are demanding to know why many losses at Merrill did not appear on the books at the time of the deal.
