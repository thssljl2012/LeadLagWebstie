But Mr Lewis said he would stay on as CEO of the North Carolina-based bank until it paid back the $45bn of government money it received under the US Treasurys bank recapitalisation programme, possibly within two to three years. This is the first time he has signalled his plans to leave the company.        However, he expressed regret that an abundance of caution had led him to take more aid than he said was necessary to absorb Merrills $15bn fourth-quarter loss.         In hindsight, it was a tactical mistake because it put us in the same category as Citigroup, said Mr Lewis. We could still have had 8 per cent tier 1 capital after a $15bn loss but we wanted a cushion.        Mr Lewis said that it would have been better to request only $10bn for that purpose. He said that could have helped to curtail investor fears that further problems were in the offing.         I want to repay the Tarp money before I go anywhere, and by then I think we will be seeing the success of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, he said. It would be very easy to disappear into the sunset but we have to slug through this.          I believe Lewis, but I don't think the market does.  I think B of A stock is poised for a huge jump after positive (or better than expected) results for Q1.  I think the market has given an "I'll believe it when I see it" approach.
