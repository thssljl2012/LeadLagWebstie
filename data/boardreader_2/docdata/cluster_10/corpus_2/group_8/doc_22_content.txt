But Mr Lewis said he would stay on as CEO of the North Carolina-based bank until it paid back the $45bn of government money it received under the US Treasurys bank recapitalisation programme, possibly within two to three years.         So, begs the questions, how will Pfizer get past the 1-year bridge loan lending facility, if banks are getting out of the government borrowing/nationalization process?????????                      Thats if he doesn't find his way into a jail cell first.  Seems like Mr. Lewis refuses to answer specific questions about Merrill Lynch bonuses to NY Attorney Gen. Cuomo.  Slapped his NC ass with a supeona.  Sweet justice would be for all these bankers go to jail and be put in general population.  Also, the difficulty for Pfizer to bridge the short-term loan to the secondary market may not be easy, potentially causing the 4-consortium banks to  have to keep the bridge loans on their books.
