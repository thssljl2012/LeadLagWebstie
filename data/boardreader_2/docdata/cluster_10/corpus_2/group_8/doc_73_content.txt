 Bank of America Corp., the largest U.S. bank by assets, said it offered information on Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.&#8217;s bonuses sought by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who declined to keep it confidential.       &#8220;Bank of America does not believe the attorney general needs the freedom to place private, personal information in the news media in order to conduct his investigation,&#8221; Scott Silvestri, a spokesman for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank, said today in an e-mail.
