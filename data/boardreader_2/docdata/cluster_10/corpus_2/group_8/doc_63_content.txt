In January, for instance, a Merrill mortgage trader set off alarms when he broke the banks rules on bulk purchases for the second time. In February, Mr. Montag called traders in Europe to question them on the way they had hedged their trades.              It would be a tragedy if Bank of America shuts down much of the institutional trading business of Merrill Lynch, but on the other hand, it was trading that brought Merrill down, Mr. Hintz said.   &gt;&gt;&gt;                    http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/06/business/06wall.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss
