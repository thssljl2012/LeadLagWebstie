          WASHINGTON, March 5 /PRNewswire/ -- In a letter to Bank of America (NYSE: BAC - News) Lead Director O. Temple Sloan, the CtW Investment Group called on BAC's board to remove Ken Lewis as Chairman and CEO in light of his disastrous missteps. Since the September 15, 2008 announcement of the merger with Merrill Lynch, BAC has:      * Suffered a 90% drop in share price     * Allowed Merrill to pay out $3.6 billion in bonuses, even as the firm was hemorrhaging money     * Denied any active role in determining the size of Merrill bonuses, a claim subsequently contradicted by documents that have emerged in the NY Attorney General's investigation     * Failed to timely disclose over $20 billion in pre-tax losses at Merrill     * Failed to invoke the Material Adverse Effects clause of the merger agreement to protect BAC shareholders from these losses.    http://finance.yahoo.com/news/CtW-Investment-Group-Calls-on-...
