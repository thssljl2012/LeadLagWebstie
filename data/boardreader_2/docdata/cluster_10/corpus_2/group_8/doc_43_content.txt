 NEW YORK (Reuters)  Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) said it could suffer "grave harm" if it is forced to reveal data about an estimated $3.6 billion of bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch &amp; Co officials in the days before the bank acquired the brokerage.  In a petition filed late Wednesday in a New York state court in Manhattan, the bank urged Justice Bernard Fried to reject New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's demand for the data, which the bank believes should be kept confidential.  ....  Bank of America said revealing the data could help rivals  poach talent , prompt employees to leave because their privacy was violated, cause "internal dissension and consternation," increase security risks for bonus recipients, and give rivals a better idea of which businesses it considers most valuable.   http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090305/bs_nm/us_bankofamer...      Let's take this point-by-point.   Talent? The company's shares are trading at just over $3. Internal advice directed them to buy Merrill Lynch. And this is the result of having talent?   BAC is planning to downsize anyway. So why would they not want employees to leave? Oh Wait! Does this have something to do with talent going away?  Internal dissention and consternation: you mean some people might get their feelings hurt?  Security risks: I guess. To me, just claiming to be a Bank of America executive could put one in harm's way.  If you are a publicly traded company, your rivals can see for themselves which businesses are more valuable by looking at the 10-K reports filed with the SEC.  So I do not buy any of this nonsense.
