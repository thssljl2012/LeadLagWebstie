       Bank of America uncovers new $120 mln Merrill losses:report 7:42 AM ET, Mar 06, 2009 - By Greg Morcroft  NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Officials at Bank of America have recently uncovered at least $120 million of losses attributable to one London trader, and "hundreds of millions" of other losses on derivative trades, The New York Times reported on Friday. According to the report, the losses occurred before Bank of America's rushed acquisition of Merrill Lynch and were missed by bank accountants reviewing Merrill's books. The Times report identified the trader it reported was responsible for the currency losses as Alexis Stenfors. The report said Stenfors told the paper the matter was a "misunderstanding." Regarding the new losses on derivatives, the report said that discussions about how to account for the positions in question were ongoing during Bank of America's acquisition of Merrill, and were not acknowledged until after the deal closed.
