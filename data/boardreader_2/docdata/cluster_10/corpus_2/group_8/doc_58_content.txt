JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has more than $91 trillion in derivatives  40.6 times its total assets  including more than $9 trillion in credit default swaps, the riskiest form of derivatives. The U.S. Comptroller of the Currency has warned that JPMorgan Chase Bank is exposed to extremely large credit risk with its derivatives trading partners: For each dollar of capital, the bank has credit exposure of $4.00  nearly twice the average exposure of Bank of America and Citibank. This makes you wonder why JPM is around $18 and BAC at $3.50
