          Minnesota-based US Bancorp, and Wells Fargo, formed when Norwest, Minnesotas biggest bank, bought San Franciscos Wells Fargo and took its name and head office, represent the conservative Minnesotan approach to banking. Both have sidestepped damage from the credit crisis. Their combined market value on Monday was $138bn, down 6.2 per cent from the beginning of last year.  The market value of Citigroup and JPMorgan, the two biggest New York banks, which have swallowed such names as Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover, Chase Manhattan and Salomon Brothers, was only $123.5bn, down 49.4 per cent over the same period.  As for Charlotte, North Carolina, its two biggest banks, Bank of America and Wachovia, created national retail banks after a buying spree.   Their market cap briefly exceeded that of Citi and JPMorgan last year. But Wells Fargo bought Wachovia in a fire sale. BofAs market value is $63.5bn, down 69 per cent from the two banks combined value a year ago.   This is an object lesson in how to run a bank.     http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/aea318f8-e1ae-11dd-afa0-0000779fd2...   Buffett knows how to pick banks.
