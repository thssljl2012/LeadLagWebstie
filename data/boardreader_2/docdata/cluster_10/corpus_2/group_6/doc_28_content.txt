 BAC Message Board Posts          Recs: 1              Re: Bloomberg: Bank of America May Be the Next Citi, Rosner Says (Update2)      Several people close to BofA said that it had told the government that it wanted to scrap its takeover of    Merrill Lynch    last month after realising the depth of the investment banks losses in the fourth quarter.         If this is true than Ken Lewis was a fool to proceed offering a stock exchange of what.....  .85+- for Merrill.  If true they could have easily renegotiated a much cheaper price.  Blaming government is a cop out at best.  Bac is in trouble and the dividend is toast IMO.            thread start
