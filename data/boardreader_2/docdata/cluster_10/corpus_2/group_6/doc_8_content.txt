Merrill Lynch paid billions in bonuses before bailout                         Merrill Lynch, the loss-making Wall Street bank, paid its staff billions of dollars in bonuses even as it prepared to be taken over by the US government-backed Bank of America.

Merrill paid out an estimated $3 billion to $4 billion in bonuses in December. In previous years, the bank is said to have paid annual bonuses in January or February.   The total compensation bill at Merrill last year is said to have been around $15 billion, a sum reported to be only 6 per cent lower than in 2007.   Of that, between $3 billion and $4 billion is said to have been handed out in bonuses in late December, after the Bank of America takeover had been confirmed. The merger took effect on January 1.   During 2008, Merrill sustained huge losses, forcing its sale to Bank of America.   In the last three months of 2008 alone, Merrill lost $21.5 billion.   In a statement, Bank of America said the decision on the timing of Merrill's bonus round was taken by John Thain, who was chief executive of the bank before it was taken over.   The statement said: "Merrill Lynch was an independent company until January 1, 2009." John Thain decided to pay year-end incentives in December as opposed to their normal date in January. BofA was informed of his decision."     %*&amp;!$#@^...  We paid for those bonuses    !   Even those of us who are unemployed...                                                       __________________
