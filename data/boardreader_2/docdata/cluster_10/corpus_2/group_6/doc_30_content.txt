 BAC Message Board Posts          Recs: 0              Re: Bloomberg: Bank of America May Be the Next Citi, Rosner Says (Update2)    While I am not happy with what has happened at BAC and the other large banks, I think you have to balance your discussion with all the facts.  As noted in the attached link, BAC was apparently going to walk away from the Merrill purchase but was convinced to stay with a promise from the Feds that they would provide more funds and cover losses above an amount that we in the public have not yet been made aware of.  If all of that is so, than it sounds like BAC is getting pissed on by most of the press for buying Merrill at to high of a price when they were also getting their arms twisted by the Fed not to back out.  No win situation.     http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/01/14/ap5922421.html       thread start
