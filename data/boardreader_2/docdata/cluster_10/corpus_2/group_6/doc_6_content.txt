Financials Bring Down the Market, Again; Hoping for an Obama Bounce http://seekingalpha.com/article/115361-financials-bring-down-the-market-again-hoping-for-an-obama-bounce?source=yahoo It was all about the financials again last week. Citigroup (C) reported over $8 billion in losses for the most recent quarter and announced it was splitting up into two entities: one to concentrate on core investment and banking activities, credit cards and high net worth individuals and another to hold all "non-core" businesses like real estate lending, private branded credit cards, various kinds of consumer lending (CitiFinancial, Primerica, student loan and auto lending) and most of the toxic waste currently dragging down the balance sheet. In addition, Citi did a deal to sell majority interest in its brokerage unit Smith Barney to Morgan Stanley (MS). There was a whiff of desperation there as Smith Barney was actually one of Citi's profitable businesses. As if that wasn't exciting enough, we had Bank of America (BAC) receiving another 11th hour bailout from the Treasury. BofA claimed that without it they wouldn't be able to complete the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. BofA then announced a $1.79 billion 4th quarter loss and that didn't even include an approximately $15 billion loss at Merrill. Looks like buying both Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch might not have been such great ideas after all.
