 BAC Message Board Posts          Recs: 0              Re: Bloomberg: Bank of America May Be the Next Citi, Rosner Says (Update2)    I'm not going to argue with you on this but I think it is very possible that BAC may have had more time by Dec to look at Merrill's books and decided the losses were to large to accept.  After all, the original decision to buy must have been contingent on additional due diligence as the entire thing was put together very quickly.  Most purchases like this would have had out clauses should the buyer discover new information.      I also think it is very likely the Feds were twisting arms.  They did it in the first TARP money they sent to the banks where they told them to take it whether they wanted to or not.  Apparently some, like Wells, didn't want it but had no choice.    The Feds are running scared and don't know what they are doing.  They were going to do a forced sale of Wachovia to Citi for $2 billion.  Wells steps in and steals it for $14 billion and now we hear the FDIC sold IndyMac for $14 billion with a cap on the losses the buyers have to absorb.  Does anyone believe Wachovia and IndyMac are anywhere near equivalent organizations?  Give me a break.    Sad state we are in but in the long run this to will pass.  I'm out of here for now.      thread start
