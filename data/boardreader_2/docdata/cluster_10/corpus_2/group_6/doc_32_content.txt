Given our economic outlook, it seems reasonable to consider BofA may be the next Citi, Rosner, a managing director in New York at the investment-research firm, wrote in a note to clients today.     Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank by assets,    JPMorgan Chase    &amp; Co., the second-largest, and Wells Fargo &amp; Co., the biggest U.S. bank by stock-market value, have so far outperformed competitors, posting profits amid the U.S.    housing collapse   , market turmoil and global recession.     Citigroup has received $45 billion of government capital injections and a U.S. guarantee on $306 billion in troubled assets. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Merrill Lynch have received a combined $25 billion from the Treasury Departments plan to shore up U.S. banks, while the lender is also borrowing through other government-backed programs.     The U.S. is close to extending aid to Bank of America to help fund the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, the Wall Street Journal reported.    Scott Silvestri   , a spokesman for Bank of America, declined to comment on that report.     Estimating Losses     Trying to put a number on the banks potential losses is the equivalent of necromancy, Rosner wrote, partly because neither the bank nor Merrill Lynch have detailed their holdings well enough.     The company has been setting aside too little reserves for its    home equity credit lines   ,    commercial lending    and other debt, Rosner wrote. It must also deal with losses tied to the purchases of Merrill Lynch, the third-biggest U.S. securities firm, and Countrywide, the largest home lender, he wrote. The bank may repurchase bad loans Countrywide sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-run U.S. mortgage finance giants, he said.     New York-based bank Citigroup said yesterday that it would cede control of the Smith Barney brokerage to Morgan Stanley as Chief Executive Officer    Vikram Pandit    unravels his empire to further bolster its capital, after $20 billion of net losses over the four periods through the third quarter.     Bank of America, which under Chief Executive Officer    Kenneth Lewis    had $6 billion of profits, may report fourth-quarter net income of 17 cents a share, the average estimate of 12 analysts    surveyed    by Bloomberg. The bank is more likely to post a loss of 75 cents a share, or $3.6 billion, Citigroup analyst    Keith Horowitz    said in a Jan. 11 note to clients.     Predicted Meltdown     Rosner released a paper in February 2007 with    Joseph Mason   , now at Louisiana State University, that said collateralized debt obligations tied to subprime mortgages would soon cause a financial-market meltdown.     Some AAA-rated securities, then valued at about 100 cents on the dollar, later fell to zero. Mortgage-tied CDOs were the largest source of the more than $1 trillion of writedowns and credit losses taken by financial companies, according to Bloomberg data.     In a more severe economic downturn than is likely, Bank of America may need to raise $1.8 billion to offset losses from home loans, credit cards and commercial real estate debt, CreditSights Inc. analyst    David Hendler    said in a Jan. 6 report.     The bank can otherwise meet its capital needs, Hendler said, noting that it recently raised $2.8 billion from selling part of a stake in China Construction Bank and expects $7 billion in annual cost savings from its Merrill Lynch purchase.     San Francisco-based Wells Fargo may need to raise $10 billion and cut its dividend after its acquisition of Wachovia Corp., Atlantic Equities LLP analyst    Richard Staite    wrote today.
