Ahead of the Bell: Analyst cuts estimates on banks Analyst slashes 4th-quarter and 2009 estimates for large banks due to mounting loan losses A JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. analyst on Tuesday cut his fourth-quarter and 2009 estimates for multiple large capitalization banks due to expected increases in loan losses and further write-downs on the value of investments. Analyst Vivek Juneja cut his fourth-quarter and 2009 estimates on Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Fifth Third Bancorp, SunTrust Banks Inc., U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. In a research note, Juneja said he expects large increases in net charge-offs -- loans written off as not being repaid -- to continue through 2009 and into 2010 at all the banks. Commercial real estate, credit cards and commercial loans are likely to drive the increases in charge-offs, Juneja said. Among the banks for which Juneja cut estimates, he expects charge-off rates in 2009 to range between a low of 1.94 percent at SunTrust and a high of 4.16 percent at Citigroup. The charge-off rate is the rate of loans written off as a percentage of the entire loan portfolio. Fourth-quarter profit will be hurt by rising write-downs, Juneja said as the value of some investments such as mortgage-backed securities faltered further during October and November. Juneja now expects Bank of America to lose 16 cents per share in the fourth quarter and earn $1.25 per share in 2009. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, on average, forecast earnings of 15 cents per share for the fourth quarter and $1.79 for 2009. Juneja now predicts a loss of $1.09 per share at Citigroup during the fourth quarter and a loss of 30 cents per share for 2009. Analysts forecast a loss of $1.14 per share for the fourth quarter and a loss of 15 cents per share for 2009. At Fifth Third, Juneja expects the bank to lose 6 cents per share for the fourth quarter and 5 cents per share for 2009. Analysts expect Fifth Third to earn 3 cents per share during the fourth quarter and 44 cents per share in 2009. SunTrust is likely to lose 5 cents per share when it reports fourth-quarter results and earnings of 50 cents per share in 2009, Juneja wrote in the note. Analysts expect SunTrust to earn 15 cents per share during the final quarter of 2008 and $1.12 per share in 2009. Juneja expects U.S. Bancorp to earn 21 cents per share in the fourth quarter and $1.70 per share in 2009. U.S. Bancorp is likely to earn 25 cents per share in the final quarter of 2008 and $1.81 per share in 2009, according to analysts' average estimate. Juneja predicts Wells Fargo will earn 34 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 and $1.80 per share in 2009. The average analyst estimate is for earnings of 35 cents per share for the fourth quarter and $1.74 per share for 2009.
