J.P. Morgan Chase , which brought forward its earnings report by a week, turned up, above 27 in pre-open trade as the New York giant met expectations with a $702 million, or seven cents a share, profit in the fourth quarter. Still, that profit is down from $3 billion in the prior-year quarter. Bank of America (BAC:$10.20,00$-0.45,00-4.23%) slipped 7% as The Wall Street Journal reported it's close to getting billions of dollars more in aid to close its acquisition of Merrill Lynch. Dan Greenhaus, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak, said the government has a duty to help out Bank of America (BAC:$10.20,00$-0.45,00-4.23%) and others that bought troubled financials. "I highly doubt the government, after turning to these companies for help, is going to leave them hanging with the negative repercussions of their shotgun marriages," he said.
