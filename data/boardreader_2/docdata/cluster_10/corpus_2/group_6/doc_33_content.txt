Staite, based in London, downgraded Wells Fargo to underweight from neutral today and said the bank may announce disappointing earnings this year because of the deteriorating economy. Wells Fargo reports fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 28.    With the accelerating decline in house prices in California and surge in unemployment we expect them to suffer significant losses in 2009, Staite wrote. Given the weak economic outlook there is a chance the dividend could be cut as a way to conserve capital.    Wells Fargo shares have outperformed those of its top competitors, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp., in the past year because the company avoided most of the riskiest loans during the credit bubble. The San Francisco-based bank bolstered its quarterly dividend by 10 percent in 2008 to 34 cents a share, while New York-based Citigroup and Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America slashed their payouts.    Wells Fargo spokeswoman Julia Tunis Bernard said the company doesnt comment on analyst reports.    Warren Buffett    The bank, whose biggest shareholder is Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway Inc., completed the $12.7 billion purchase of Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia on Jan. 1. In the three months since the companies agreed to the deal, economists on average have raised their estimates for unemployment to 8 percent by the third quarter from 6.2 percent, Bloomberg surveys show.    Moodys Investors Service cut Wells Fargos debt rating to Aa3 from Aa1 on Jan. 6 on concern the Wachovia deal will hurt earnings. The deal significantly weakened Wells Fargos capital position, Moodys said.    Staite wrote today that Wells Fargos capital ratios have deteriorated significantly because of the acquisition. The companys tangible common equity to risk weighted assets has fallen to 3.6 percent from 6.2 percent, he wrote. Thats after Wells Fargo raised cash to help finance the deal.    This ends WFCs long history of having one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector and now instead it has one of the weakest, Staite wrote.    Wells Fargo fell $1.31, or 5.4 percent, to $23.07 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange as stocks in the U.S. and Europe tumbled. Wells Fargo has dropped 18 percent in the past year, compared with the 57 percent slump in the 24-company        thread start
