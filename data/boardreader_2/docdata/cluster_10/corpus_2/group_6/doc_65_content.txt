                        Is Bank of America the Next Citi?   Posted: 15 Jan 2009 07:42 AM PST    by Joshua Rosner      Joshua Rosner is a managing director at the independent research consultancy Graham Fisher &amp; Co., where he advises regulators and institutional investors on housing and mortgage finance issues            The Department of Treasury sent out an announcement at 5p.m. yesterday titled:   Treasury Provides TARP Funds to Local Banks. Most recipients of last evenings   email announcement probably left it unopened in their inbox or went further and erased   it. It would be understandable for most to think that it was unimportant news that   Treasury gave money to the First National Bank of Tinytown USA.          Had more people opened it they would have realized that Treasury has given Bank of   America and the American Express Company previously promised money. Even   with a shiny new $10 billion from Treasury, the money that they receive for closing the   ill-fated Merrill acquisition, I believe it all but certain that the Company will end up back   on the Treasurys soup kitchen line. The Government, in repeating their mistake with   Freddie Bear, Lehman and Citi, appears to have missed the chance to require BofA to   raise capital and it now appears they are ours.          Ultimately, I expect larger than expected losses will come from inadequate reserves   relative to the risks in BofAs HELOC, construction, commercial real estate and   commercial loan books and also from the poor timing and likely worse modeling of their   acquisitions of Countrywide and Merrill Lynch. Given our economic outlook, it seems   reasonable to consider BofA may be the next Citi. I do wonder if the Government   will approach things differently or take on their obligations without forcing BofA equity   holders to relearn the forgotten price of poor risk-taking in investments. I also wonder if   the government has learned its lesson or will it again push for non-workable openmarket   mergers of toxic, asset-laden, institutions.          So, what is the number one might ask. Any attempt to answer that would be the result   necromancy and not analysis. Neither BofA nor Merrill detailed their structured   exposures well enough for investors to analyze the appropriateness of the values assumed   in their marks or to assess the asset sensitivity to further economic weakness. Moreover,   we do not have enough granularity to assess the sector exposures of their commercial real   estate, their construction lending or their commercial loan books. Moreover, we believe   the real economic fallout is just beginning and, as unemployment rises, losses will   become a moving target.          At the time that BofA took a strategic stakeout position in Countrywide, I stated that it   appeared they were making a bet they could pick a bottom in the housing market. I made   it clear I was analytically on the other side of their housing outlook. It appears they   wrongly believed the housing market and broader economy were independent of each   other.          The speed with which BofA swooped into their Countrywide backstop suggested that   they failed to do a thorough due diligence. Given the terms, I could not believe they   properly modeled how bad losses would get due to Countrywides shoddy underwriting   or the probability of increasing costs and in their servicing business.          Countrywide was the pioneering player that grew for much of this decade by taking risky   mortgage products, designed and tested in California (often by other California players),   and going on the road to sell those products door to door across our country. They were at   the forefront of the now proven to be false belief that: once we sell the mortgage to an   investor or guarantor, either through private label securitization or GSE guarantees, we   no longer own the risk.          By the time that BofA stepped into the morass and committed to fully take Countrywide   they indicated they might not assume all of Countrywides debt. Perhaps they realized   that they had miscalculated the level of losses, but also seeming to believe we were closer   to an economic bottom than we were. At the time BofA also appeared to expect that, as   the largest originator of conforming conventional loans, they would benefit in recovery   because the GSEs were increasingly the only game in town.          We now know that even if the GSEs were the only game in town that game is now a   schoolyard pick-up game and unable to offer much to a former major league player. We   also know that the GSEs, by being the only game, seem to have increasing leverage in   their put-backs of bad loans.          GSE seller-servicer agreements suggest the GSEs claim the right to push losses onto   servicers in cases where mortgage insurers choose not to, or are unable to, pay for any   reason, Unconfirmed sources suggest the GSEs are making claims that lenders were   specifically instructed not to use those systems as the basis for their own lending   decisions and using those standards as the basis to put loans back to various originators.   While these risks seem to expose more than just BofA, their size and ties to the GSEs   seem to suggest they are perhaps the most exposed.          Beyond significant problems in Countrywides residential and commercial mortgage   businesses are the risks of growing losses in BofAs Merrill Lynch acquisition and in   their own commercial and construction books. I would suspect that by late in the second   quarter we will begin to recognize that commercial, construction and corporate loans will   be defaulting, industry-wide, in hockey-stick form. If there is one-thing BofA   shareholders can be thankful for it is that GE Capital had purchased Merrills middlemarket          commercial financial arm in late 2007.   As the problems continue their transition from capital and credit market issues to an   ongoing rationalization of capacity in the real economy we will be increasingly unable to   sneak $10 billion of taxpayer money to band-aid deeply troubled financial institutions.          We will also recognized that, as Japan learned almost two decades ago and equity holders   should have recognized long ago, consolidating bad banks with worse banks without first   stripping away their combined bad assets is a recipe for long term deflation.
