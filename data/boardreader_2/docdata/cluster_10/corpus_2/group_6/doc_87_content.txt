Investors warm to Citigroup breakup Citigroup splits into two banks; investors cheer. Bank of America gets a bailout from the Treasury, but it may not be enough to keep the bank in business. Intel results please the Street. Citigroup (C, news, msgs) announced fourth-quarter losses of $8.2 billion today. The losses amounted to $1.72 per share, far more than the analyst consensus of $1.12 per share. It marks the fifth consecutive quarterly deficit for the bank, which has received a $306 billion government bailout. The U.S. government currently owns about 7.5% of the bank. The bank's management announced that it is to break up into two businesses: Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp is the so-called "good" bank. It is to include the company's private and investment bank as well as its credit card and consumer banking business. Citi Holdings, the "bad" bank, is to incorporate its so-called noncore businesses, including its Smith Barney brokerage and a special pool of troubled assets. "This will help in our ongoing efforts to reduce our balance sheet and simplify our organization, which will enable us to better serve our clients and customers in both businesses without disruption," CEO Vikram Pandit said in a statement. Citigroup's stock has been hammered since it announced the sale of 51% of its securities brokerage Smith Barney on Tuesday to Morgan Stanley (MS, news, msgs) for $2.7 billion, in a move that will create a joint venture unit shared between the two banks. Since October, Citigroup shares have lost 76% of their value. The bank is giving up on the "financial supermarket" approach that its previous managers had implemented. Shares in the bank rose 14.4% in trading today at Frankfurt, Germany.
