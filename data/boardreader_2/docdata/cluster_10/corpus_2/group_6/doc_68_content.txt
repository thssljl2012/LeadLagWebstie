Bank of America Corp., the largest U.S. bank by assets, posted its first loss since 1991 and cut the dividend after receiving emergency funds from the government to support the acquisition of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.         The fourth-quarter loss of $1.79 billion, or 48 cents a share, compared with net income of $268 million, or 5 cents, a year earlier, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said in a statement today. Citigroup Inc. analyst Keith Horowitz estimated on Jan. 11 that Bank of America would post a $3.6 billion loss.         The loss, coupled with the government lifeline of $138 billion, raises doubts about the future of Chief Executive Officer Kenneth D. Lewis, who engineered the takeovers of unprofitable New York-based brokerage Merrill and ailing mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp. during the worst market slump since the Great Depression. Bank of America has plummeted 75 percent in New York trading since the Merrill acquisition was announced in September, falling to the lowest level in almost two decades.         This thing is unraveling so fast Lewis may know his job is lost, said Paul Miller, an analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey Group Inc. in Arlington, Virginia, who has an underperform rating on Bank of America. The management team has lost credibility, he said.         The government said earlier today it will invest $20 billion in Bank of America and guarantee $118 billion of assets to help the company absorb Merrill and prevent the financial crisis from deepening. The agreement is part of a commitment to support financial-market stability, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said in a joint statement shortly after midnight in Washington.
