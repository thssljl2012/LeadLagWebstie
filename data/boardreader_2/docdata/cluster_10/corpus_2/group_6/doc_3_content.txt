Citigroup signaled the end of a decade-long experiment to create one-stop  shopping for financial servicesknown as a "financial supermarket"with  Tuesday's announcement that it was merging its Smith Barney brokerage into a  joint venture with Morgan Stanley [MS 17.85 -1.01 (-5.36%) ].    The deal, which will give Citigroup $2.7 billion in badly needed cash as it  gives up control of Smith Barney, comes as the company still struggles in the  aftermath of the mortgage and credit crisis.    Citigroup's stock [C 4.83 -1.07 (-18.14%) ] plunged below the critical $5  level on Wednesday as investors and analysts worried whether the bank can be  profitable and function effectively as it unravels its business model.    The bank also announced that it will release its fourth-quarter financial  results this Fridaynearly a week ahead of schedulewhere it is expected to  post its fifth straight quarterly loss. JPMorgan Chase [JPM 25.32 -1.03   (-3.93%) ] reports earnings on Thursday, also nearly a week ahead of schedule.    Citigroup CEO Vikram Pandit, who for months supported the financial supermarket  model, is expected to take further steps to simplify and streamline the company.    Pandit's future at the bank may depend on it. Wall Street executives say board  members are growing impatient with Pandit and will be pressuring him for  results.    Citigroup's major shareholders  Profile of banking giant  Follow Citigroup's stock  Many people on Wall Street believe Citigroup could be headed for a larger-scale  dismantling if the federal governmentwhich now has a stake in Citi thanks to  its recent bailouthas its way.    "I think within 12 months, Citigroup no longer exists," said William Smith at  Smith Asset Management, who owns Citigroup shares. He has been calling for a  breakup of Citigroup for years, and believes the government will force that fate  in piecemeal fashion over the coming year.    Citigroup is planning to adopt the equivalent of a "good bank, bad bank''  structure, in which it would slim down to a business model recalling the former  Citicorp, a person familiar with the plan said.    The plan envisions focusing on corporate, investment and retail banking and  keeping a slimmer trading business, while moving unwanted assets and businesses  such as complex debt to a separate structure, the person said on condition of  anonymity.    Citigroup's "bad bank'' would have about $600 billion of assets, close to  one-third of Citigroup's balance sheet, which could eventually be sold or spun  off, the person said.    Assets that could be sold include its Primerica unit, which sells life  insurance, mutual funds and other financial products.    Segregating bad assets has a history of success, said Mike Holland, a money  manager at Holland in New York. "It worked in the savings and loan crisis (in  the 1980s). I'm getting a sense of deja vu, in a good way.''    Citigroup declined to comment on its longer-term plans.    Citigroup was the quintessential financial supermarket, cobbled together over  decades by Sandy Weillthe former CEO who is both lauded for bringing  Citigroup its biggest profits ever and criticized for creating an unsustainably  massive, impossible-to-manage conglomerate.    The idea behind the supermarket is that the average person can do all his  saving, borrowing and investing with one company.    Citigroup had it all, the retail and business banking operations, the investment  banking business, the brokerage, even Travelers insurance.    Whether that one company does it better than a number of specialized companies  does, though, has been the big question facing shareholders since the  deregulation of the banking industry in the 1990s.    And Citi's announcement Tuesday further undermines the idea that one company can  handle such diverse businesses at once.    To be sure, JPMorgan Chase's model is essentially a supermarket, too, but it  does not have as large an international presence as Citigroup has had.

Perhaps more importantly, analysts argue that these banking giants were managed  and integrated much better over the years than Citigroup was.    "The problem with Citi is the model, the execution, the management," Smith said.  "How do you go a decade without integrating?"    Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase also took fewer risks than Citi took when it  came to the now-failed investments in mortgage-backed securities, and so their  losses were much less than the big financial supermarket suffered.    Weill, helped by the force of his personality, made the concept work during his  years at the helm, although he presided over the spinoff and sale of the  Travelers businesses starting in 2002.    Options and HSBC: Memories of Lehman, Bear Stearns  Slideshow: Famous Last Words from Financial Execs    The company, whose stock price is now only about a tenth of what it was just two  years ago, has struggled since Weill retired in 2006.    In late November, Pandit called the financial supermarket "the right model," and  that Citigroup's strategy is "to be the world's truly global universal bank."    Days later, the government lent the embattled bank $45 billionmore than other  big banks have receivedand agreed to absorb the losses on a huge pool of  mortgages and other assets.    Citigroup and Morgan Stanley plan to combine Citi's brokerage, Smith Barney,  with Morgan Stanley's wealth management business. The deal was announced after  the close of stock trading.    The capital from the Morgan Stanley deal, however, is likely not enough to make  up for upcoming losses. And if the government decides it does not want to  continue propping up banks like Citigroup, its dismantling could accelerate.    The new administration could "come to the realization that the whole economy  does not hinge on the banks," said Octavio Marenzi, head of financial  consultancy Celent. "Banking is important. The banks themselves are not."

Most institutional investorspension funds, endowments and the likeare  prohibited from owning stock worth less than $5.    Citi stock is a staple of many such funds and could be battered even further  should they decide to jettison the stock if it remains below that crucial level.    Citi's stock [C 4.90 -1.00 (-16.95%) ] tumbled below $5 Wednesday as  investors worried that that the bank's attempts to shed assetssuch as the  Smith Barney brokerage unitwon't raise enough capital to offset continued  losses.    While many fund and index managers could choose to wait until the end of the  quarter to decide what to do with Citi, some might act earlier should there be a  pervasive belief that the stock won't regain its value.    "My impression is if they really felt they had a fiduciary duty it's probably  something they would do immediately," said analyst and venture capitalist Peter  S. Cohan. "They might be looking at the trajectory of the stock in anticipation  of it going down."    Citi is expected to post a loss approaching $10 billion for the fourth quarter,  and many investors are wondering how it will weather the storm.    While the company's net capital position could help mitigate some of the  negativity, there will be a strong temptation for institutional investors to  dump the company should it continue to struggle.    But the company's market cap remains close to $30 billion and it is a recipient  of federal bailout funds, putting it in a stronger position to continue than  some of the other large banks that have folded in the past year.    "You probably would see fund managers, if they really like Citi, to hold out for  the qu...
