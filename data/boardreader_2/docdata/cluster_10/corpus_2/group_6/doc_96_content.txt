  Short View: Frightening financials     By John Authers         Published: January 15 2009 19:06   Last updated: January 16 2009 00:21         Thursday was back to 2008  extreme volatility and a baffling market turnround, predicated on terror towards the financials.        The S&amp;P 500 fell 3 per cent, only to rebound 3.3 per cent from there and close up 0.1 per cent for the day. Bank of America and Citigroup, once the two biggest US banks, fell 28 and 26 per cent respectively, but then regained 26 and 30 per cent before selling off once more. Citi closed off 15 per cent, BofA 18 per cent.         What happened? The morning sell-off reflected a bet in the market that both huge banks were to suffer a lost weekend where they would negotiate fresh help from the government. Given the lousy assets on their balance sheets, Citis attempt to split itself up and BofAs travails swallowing the broker Merrill Lynch, this was a sensible bet.        There were several similar episodes in 2008, when markets dared the government to do something. Weekend-negotiated rescues for mortgage agencies in July, and for Citi in November, prompted major rallies  even though those deals both proved not enough to solve the underlying problem. So traders may have decided to bet on a satisfactory outcome.         How significant is this? Bulls can point out that it happened on the biggest trading volume of the year. At its low, the S&amp;P remained 10 per cent above its low during the panic over Citi last November, which many believed would be retested at least once.         Bears can say that Citi and BofA had terrible days, and remain down 50 and 41 per cent since early last week. The Vix index of stock volatility rose to its highest close in more than a month, so anxiety is rising.         If the market survives Fridays results from Citi and JPMorgan, and likes whatever deal emerges for the big banks, the reversal could look very significant. But if this latest banking crisis cannot be satisfactorily resolved, the turnround will look premature.
