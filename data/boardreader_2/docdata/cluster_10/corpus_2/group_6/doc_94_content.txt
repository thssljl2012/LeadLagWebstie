           Advertisements [ ? ]                         GAO: Many Bailout Recipients Operating in Tax-Haven Countries By Mike Lillis 1/16/09 2:21 PM   Want to lower your taxes and maybe get a bailout?  Incorporate.  The Government Accountability Office released a report today indicating that 83 of the 100 largest U.S. corporations  including many that are benefiting from Washingtons many taxpayer-funded bailouts  operate subsidiaries in countries known to be tax havens. Additionally, 63 of the 100 largest publicly-traded federal contractors have similar subsidiaries in the same spots, according to the report.  And that might not be all.  According to the GAO:       {T}he SEC only requires public corporations to report significant subsidiaries, so the number of subsidiaries in jurisdictions listed as tax havens or financial privacy jurisdictions for each corporation or federal contractor may be understated in this report.    Browsing the list of companies, youll find many of the same names weve heard in recent months connected to federal bailouts. For example, American International Group, which was bailed out last year to the tune of roughly $150 billion, has 18 subsidiaries in eight tax-haven countries, including Bahrain, Switzerland and Bermuda, the GAO found.  Bank of America  which received a $138 billion lifeline today, on top of $15 billion its already received under the Wall Street bailout (not to mention $10 billion injected into Merrill Lynch ahead of its acquisition by BoA)  operates 115 subsidiaries in 11 tax-haven countries, including Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands.  The list goes on.  more...   http://washingtonindependent.com/26083/gao-many-bailout...                         ...
