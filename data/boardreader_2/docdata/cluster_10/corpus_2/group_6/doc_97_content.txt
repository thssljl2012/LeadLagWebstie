         the opinion is  "Near Term Remains a Challenge, But BAC Can Weather the Storm"  It is expressed about BAC = Bank of America  It is expressed by a Smith Barney research analyst.  It is based on the idea that TARP funds will tide BAC over in the medium term (2-5 years) when, so the tacit hope seems to be, raising funds for the bank will be less of a stretch.  I have compared the charts of BAC and LLOY and find they are equally miserable.  I have not determined whether BAC has a discussion board at the Fool.  ghu
