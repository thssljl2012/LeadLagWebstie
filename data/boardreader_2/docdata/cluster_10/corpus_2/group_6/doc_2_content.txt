Citigroup, Morgan Stanley to merge brokerages    Citigroup Inc (C.N) agreed to merge its Smith Barney brokerage with Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) wealth management unit, a big step in the possible dismantling of what was once the world's largest bank.    The joint venture will create the largest U.S. brokerage, known as Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, with more than 20,000 brokers and $1.7 trillion in client assets.
