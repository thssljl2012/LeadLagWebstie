"He didn't know that Merrill was in such bad shape"    Ken Lewis is the President and CEO, it is his GODDAMN job to know what he is buying!!!                    http://investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=4352&amp;mn=2355&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=6471751           Msg : 2355 of 2356     1/14/2009 8:36:52 PM                       Author:    newalias                     send pm      add member to favs      ignore      recommend                                                                                                            Recs: 0                Is this so bad?      "Any possible arrangement might protect Bank of America from losses on Merrills bad assets. There would be a cap on the amount of losses the bank would have to absorb with the federal government being on the hook for the remainder, according to one person familiar with the matter."       No, it's not good that they need more cash, but this may not be so bad.                                      http://investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=4352&amp;mn=2348&amp;pt=msg&amp;mid=6471202         Msg : 2348 of 2356     1/14/2009 7:29:00 PM               Author:    Satman49               send pm      add member to favs      ignore      recommend                                                                   view thread ,   thread start         In response to  msg 2347  by  harleyjokim                           Recs: 0         Re: Bloomberg: Bank of America May Be the Next Citi, Rosner Says (Update2)      While I am not happy with what has happened at BAC and the other large banks, I think you have to balance your discussion with all the facts. As noted in the attached link, BAC was apparently going to walk away from the Merrill purchase but was convinced to stay with a promise from the Feds that they would provide more funds and cover losses above an amount that we in the public have not yet been made aware of. If all of that is so, than it sounds like BAC is getting pissed on by most of the press for buying Merrill at to high of a price when they were also getting their arms twisted by the Fed not to back out. No win situation.        http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2009/01/14/ap5922421.html                      thread start
