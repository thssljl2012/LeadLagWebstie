 Print          Bank of Americas Merrill Takeover May Be Tough Deal (Update2)  Email   Print   A A A   By Josh Fineman  Dec. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Bank of America Corp. Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lewiss takeover of Merrill Lynch &amp;amp;amp; Co., the capstone of more than $100 billion in acquisitions hes made since 2001, may prove the hardest to digest.   Lewis, 61, called Merrill the ideal long-term fit when the deal was announced on Sept. 14. He will generate fees from Merrills 16,850-strong sales force and says he can slash $7 billion of costs with the combination, approved by Merrill shareholders today and likely to close by the end of the month. The firms $2.8 trillion of assets would vault it over Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp;amp; Co. as the No. 1 U.S. bank.   Bank of America shares have dropped 58 percent since the all-stock purchase was struck, and Merrill is down 30 percent, valuing the $50 billion deal at $19 billion. Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz wrote Dec. 2 that the firms may have combined writedowns of $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter and had $56 billion of high-risk assets at the end of September.   There are some hand grenades on the balance sheet that are going to blow up on Bank of America, said James Ellman, a former Merrill Lynch money manger who is now president of San Francisco-based SeaCliff Capital LLC. The cost savings are going to be nowhere near what theyve already promised.   Cloudy Forecast   The sagging economy has also hurt. Three months after striking a deal with John Thain, CEO of New York-based Merrill, on the same weekend that Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sank into bankruptcy, Lewis said on Dec. 3 that his own banks outlook was too optimistic.   If someone had told me a year ago that things would be worse in December 2008 than in December 2007, I would have thought that person was half crazy, he said at a conference in Charlotte, North Carolina, the banks hometown. Lewis doesnt expect a recovery until the second half of 2009.   U.S. companies slashed payrolls at the fastest pace in 34 years last month, the Labor Department said today. The jobless rate rose to 6.7 percent, the highest level since 1993. Bank of America shares fell 17 cents to $14.17 as of 9:50 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.   Merrill, founded by Charles Merrill in 1914, went public in 1971 and in 1974 introduced its corporate logo -- a bull. Thain, 53, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker and New York Stock Exchange head who replaced CEO Stan ONeal following $2 billion of losses, struck the deal with Lewis to avoid becoming another casualty of the subprime crisis. Thain will oversee corporate and investment banking and wealth management, making him a potential successor to Lewis.   Death of a Friend   A merger was one of few options that will allow the company to continue its operations, proxy adviser RiskMetrics Group said in a Nov. 24 report.   Its really like the death of a friend, said Winthrop Smith Jr., 59, a former head of Merrills international brokerage and the son of a former Merrill CEO, who attended Merrills shareholder vote in New York. Its greatest legacy was bringing Wall Street to Main Street. They really democratized investing.   Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri declined to comment on whether the firm will retain the Merrill logo. People familiar with the companys plans said in October that Bank of America plans to keep the Merrill brand. Shareholders of Merrill endorsed the plan today, Merrill said. Bank of America shareholders vote on it later today in Charlotte.   Thundering Herd   Bank of America, already the nations biggest home lender and home-loan servicer, will become the largest brokerage firm in addition to being the biggest bank by assets. Now second to JPMorgan by deposits, the new firm may end up the No. 1 by that measure once Merrills deposits are added.   The chief draw for Lewis was Merrills brokers, who manage $1.6 trillion for customers. Merrill said last month that 99 percent of its top-selling brokers agreed to sign retention packages.   Wrapping together a sales force nicknamed the thundering herd with Bank of Americas 247,000 employees wont be easy, said Greg Donaldson, director of portfolio strategy at Donaldson Capital Management in Evansville, Indiana, which manages about $350 million.   The bankers all think the brokers are too highly paid and the brokers all think the bankers dont work hard enough, said Donaldson, who holds Bank of America shares and formerly worked at the retail brokerage unit of National City Corp.   Job Cuts   While many of the top-performing brokers at Merrill will stay, others wont be so lucky. Thain said in October that thousands of jobs would be cut. Richard Bove, an analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann Inc., said in October that Merrill may eliminate 10,000 jobs after the merger.   Lewiss acquisitions include the purchase of FleetBoston in 2003 for $48 billion and credit-card issuer MBNA Corp. for $35 billion in 2006. Bank of America became a leader in home lending and credit cards after buying Countrywide Financial Corp. Lewis said in Charlotte that card-borrowing is likely to decline as consumers pull back on spending.   The companies hes been acquiring all make sense strategically, Ellman said. But the timing and price almost always seems to be off.
