Thain is leaving?  I thought he was going to run the merged operations of Bank of America and Merril, that he title was to be President of Global Banking, Securities and Wealth Management.    I&amp;#039;m not saying he should get a bonus or not but I think you&amp;#039;d agree that it is possible that because of Thain&amp;#039;s actions investors of Merrill Lynch might have salvaged more of their investment than they would have, right?
