Good post from Yahoo: UPDATE 2-Bank of America, Wells Fargo need more equity - analyst Dec 10 (Reuters) - Banking giants Bank of America Corp (BAC.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) and Wells Fargo &amp;amp; Co (WFC.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz) may need to raise billions of dollars in common equity and face a high risk of a dividend cut, a banking analyst at Atlantic Equities said and downgraded both the stocks. &amp;quot;I know where you can get $4.4B in cash, $2B in tax refunds, a NOL for $20B that you can carry forward, and a bunch of subsidiaries. You can get this for alot less in common stock than it will take by just issuing new shares. Plus you can pay the debt off over time. Lets see WFC is at $29.19 and BOA is at $16.64. So to raise $6.4B in cash it would take roughly 219M shares of WFC and BOA 384M shares. If they assume the preferreds, pay the debt off over time, and give commons say $3 a share. That would equate to a 1 WFC to 10 WAMUQ or a 1 BOA for 5.5 WAMUQ. This would be 170M shares for WFC or 309M for BOA. The interest on the debts is 75 million and they can be paid off over time. Preferreds get reinstated with dividends. Come on boys what are you waiting for. Oh and guess who showed up at our Bankruptcy hearings .. you guessed it BOA and WFC.&amp;quot;
