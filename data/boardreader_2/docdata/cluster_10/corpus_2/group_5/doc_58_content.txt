                        Cost of Banks    Barry Ritholtz      19 Dec 2008          Consider that one year ago Royal Bank of Scotland paid US$100 billion for ABN Amro. That seemingly impossible amount would now buy:          Citibank $22,5 billion (74% down)   Morgan Stanley $10,5 billion (-72%)   Goldman Sachs $21 billion (-67%)   Merril Lynch $12,3 billion (-77%)   Deutsche Bank $13 billion (-71%)   Barclays $12,7 billion (-71%)      And still leave $8 billion change - with which you would be able to pick up General Motors, Ford, Chrysler and the Honda F1 team.
