                                                         The Great Bank Rush of 2008: What&amp;#039;s the Money For?                                                                             by: Ronald  Pires                                                      posted on: September 29, 2008                                     So many in the media seem to have swallowed the Kool-Aid that this bailout is necessary (or that the economy will self-destruct in mere days), but is it really?          IndyMac ( IDMC.PK ), Countrywide ( CFC ), Washington Mutual ( WM ), Merrill Lynch ( MER ), Lehman ( LEH ), AIG ( AIG ), Bear Stearns ( BSC ), Fannie ( FNM ) and Freddie ( FRE ) have all bitten the bullet, and the economy is still (sort of ... mostly) standing. JPMorgan ( JPM ) and Bank of America ( BAC ) seem to have developed voracious new appetites for new subsidiary operations, and Goldman Sachs&amp;#039; ( GS ) and Morgan Stanley&amp;#039;s ( MS ) (simultaneous) announcements that they are converting to bank holding companies seems to imply that they too have their stomach juices churning for new goodies.           So who&amp;#039;s left? Who&amp;#039;s hurting? Where is this great self-immolation going to come from? The fact is that it isn&amp;#039;t.           A week ago we learned that we had to cough up $700 billion in a few days with no strings attached, when just a week earlier no one knew a thing about this lurking monster. Now, a week later, the world still hasn&amp;#039;t ended and, well ..., maybe a third up front, and they won&amp;#039;t pay their execs so much, and maybe a little equity stake for the taxpayers, and yeah, we all can watch things real close too. Hmmm. Maybe we&amp;#039;ll even get some mortgage renegotiations tossed in? That would be nice.           Stop right there. No way on that last point. No mortgage renegotiations. The banks say it mustn&amp;#039;t be done, and that tells us something very important. Since mortgage renegotiations are hands down the best way to put REAL value back into this troubled paper (and would be the most palatable solution for the public), the only reason there is for the banks insisting that this not be in the bailout is that the banks don&amp;#039;t want these properties returned to their owners, and they don&amp;#039;t want to keep them either. That means that the banks simply want to raise cash quickly. But for what?  What&amp;#039;s the money for?            Two weeks back on Black Monday, the market jumped off a cliff and Bank of America swallowed Merrill Lynch whole. It was such a big news day with so many stories that a little tiny item, but for a single sentence buried nine paragraphs down in a  Financial Times  article, went entirely overlooked. The sentence read,   &amp;amp;quot;The Fed also suspended rules that prohibit banks from using deposits to fund their investment banking subsidiaries.&amp;amp;quot;     THAT  should have been the day&amp;#039;s headline , and everything that has happened since can be explained by that sentence.       The sentence of course refers to our FDIC-insured deposits.  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 ended the strict separation of these deposits from unregulated investment banks, but even after that, only 30% of a bank&amp;#039;s deposits could be used to back it&amp;#039;s investment subsidiaries, and only 10% could back any individual subsidiary . Any more than that, even in the heydays of deregulation fever, was considered too risky to be backed by FDIC insurance.       All that went out the window on Black Monday.  Merrill Lynch needed to be bought quickly and Bank of America was interested, but there was a problem. JPMorgan had gotten billions to back Bear Stearns&amp;#039; bad paper during that takeover, and Bank of America needed a similar deal. Trouble was that back during the Morgan-Bear deal, the government had $900 billion sloshing around in its accounts, but by Black Monday there was only $100 billion left that had not already been promised, and that couldn&amp;#039;t be spared. In other words, the Fed had run out of money. That&amp;#039;s when the deal was struck. Bank of America could use  ALL  of its FDIC-insured accounts as backing for Merrill&amp;#039;s bad paper. The sale was made. Bank of America had its prize.         Of course, the Treasury couldn&amp;#039;t just do this rule change for Bank of America; they had to do it for everyone, and all of a sudden, the entire landscape of banking had changed. Every bank that had FDIC-insured deposits was now worth a lot more money because its insured assets could now be effectively collateralized and used to back investment banking operations. Within days, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, seeking to stake their claims to the vein of gold that Bank of America had mined, converted from investment banks to bank holding companies. The Great Bank Rush of 2008 had begun.....              full story:  http://seekingalpha.com/article/978...#comment-268471                Kommentare lesen                                      __________________          ********      **      *      **      **           http://www.poodwaddle.com/worldclock.swf             **      *********      **      **
