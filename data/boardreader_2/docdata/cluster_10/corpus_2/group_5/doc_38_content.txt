People gonna need `em, more layoffs...         December layoffs exceed 100k     December 12, 2008: Job cuts continue to mount in December as recession deepens.         Quote:                         The second week of December was another brutal one for jobs, as Bank of America and at least 20 other companies announced more massive cuts.  &amp;quot;The recent news does not bode well,&amp;quot; said Rich Yamarone, director of economic research at Argus Research. &amp;quot;This is the reason it's going to be the longest recession we've had in post World War II history.&amp;quot;      The week got off to a rough start on Monday when Dow Chemical said it would eliminate 5,000 positions and close 20 plants. In addition, Belgian-based brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev said it would reduce 1,400 positions; 3M also reported 1,800 cuts.  On Tuesday Sony, Danaher Corp., Wyndham Worldwide, the National Football League and Principal Financial Group announced job cuts totaling another 14,400 positions. Novellus Systems and electronics gaming company EA also announced staff reductions without specifying a number of employees.      On Wednesday, Office Depot unveiled its plan to cut about 2,200 jobs; British mining company Rio Tinto said it would cut 14,000 jobs worldwide; and SKF, a Swedish manufacturer of bearings, revealed plans to lay off 2,500 workers globally.  Thursday was particularly bad, thanks to news that Bank of America  plans to slash up to 35,000 jobs over the next three years as it absorbs Merrill Lynch and contends with the deepening recession.
