                                                         21 September 2008             Goldmans Sachs and Morgan Stanley To Become Bank Holding Companies                    American Banker      Goldman, Morgan Become Bank Holding Companies, Ending Era     By Steven Sloan    Sunday, September 21, 2008       Last two major investment banks to be regulated like commercial rivals       WASHINGTON  A week after Lehman Brothers collapsed and Merrill Lynch put itself up for sale,  the two remaining investment banks  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley  won approval Sunday from the Federal Reserve Board to convert to bank holding companies .      The Fed said its approval was subject to a five-day antitrust waiting period but  the announcement effectively ends the business of standalone investment banking and dramatically changes the landscape of Wall Street .   ( Time for the confidence men to cash in their chips and either leave town or go straight, more or less - Jesse)         To help Goldman and Morgan transition to traditional banking  which carries with it, among other things, tougher capital standards   the Fed said it would allow the firms to pledge the same types of collateral at the discount window as their commercial counterparts . Since the Fed opened the discount window to investment banks in March, the firms have mostly only been able to post highly rated securities as collateral. Now, Goldman and Morgan can send a broader range of collateral to the Fed, including mortgages.      The Fed said the same rule will now also apply to Merrill, which made a deal last week to sell itself to Bank of America Corp.  (That makes sense - Jesse)        In addition to the broader collateral rule, the conversions could also be beneficial by  allowing Goldman and Morgan to raise money by taking in insured deposits.   The move also subjects them to more oversight from the Fed, which regulates bank holding companies.    (That&amp;#039;s FDIC coverage baby. Think the banks that have been toeing the line all these years will be jealous and pissed off? You bet. - Jesse)          In a release Sunday night, Goldman said that since spring the Fed has been reviewing the firms &amp;amp;quot;liquidity and funding profile, capital adequacy, and overall risk management framework.&amp;amp;quot; Goldman said its Tier 1 capital ratio at Sept. 30 was 11.6%.      Goldman did not say what sort of banking charter it would use, but  Morgan Stanley said it plans to convert its Utah industrial bank to a national bank charter. Morgan Stanley said it had more than 3 million retail accounts and $36 billion in bank deposits as of Aug. 31 . It did not reveal its Tier 1 capital ratio.       Morgan said it would &amp;amp;quot;pursue initiatives to expand the retail banking services it offers its retail clients and build a stable base of core deposits. &amp;amp;quot;                          Posted by Jesse   at  11:16 PM                                               __________________          ********      **      *      **      **           http://www.poodwaddle.com/worldclock.swf             **      *********      **      **
