Here in Charlotte, NC, BofA headquarters city, the local press reported the news  http://www.charlotteobserver.com/business/story/68 ...  but so far there's been no editorializing on the potential for a lawsuit nor on the perception, wrong or right, that Lewis would rather keep his job, shareholders be damned, then do what was good business for his employer and bosses. It's scary to me as a Charlottean with BofA a major local employer. Already we took a hit when Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia. What next in this 10.7% unemployed city? The shareholders meet Wednesday. I wish I had some BofA stock so I could attend--but on the other hand I'm teaching three classes Wednesday and would probably opt for my bosses' welfare (my students welfare) rather than my own. But I'm just small fry.
