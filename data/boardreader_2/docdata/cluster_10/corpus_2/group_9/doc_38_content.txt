Paulson asked Lewis to come to Washington that evening to discuss the matter.    ///    Bank of Americas attempt to exit the merger came to a halt on December 21, 2008. That day, Lewis informed Secretary Paulson that Bank of America still wanted to exit the merger agreement. According to Lewis,   Secretary Paulson then advised Lewis that, if Bank of America invoked the MAC, its management and Board would be replaced
