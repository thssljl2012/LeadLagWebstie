We're seeing alot of smoke and mirrors from the banks and financial sector( where the government has taken control) and speculators are running the market up, but there's weakness everywhere else .                      Some of the story is coming out on BofA and Merrill Lynch. Bernanke and Paulson strong-armed BofA's Lewis:      "At a meeting that evening Secretary Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, Lewis, Bank of America's CFO, and other officials discussed the issues surrounding invocation of the MAC clause by Bank of America. The Federal officials asked Bank of America not to invoke the MAC until there was further consultation. There were follow-up calls with various Treasury and Federal Reserve officials, including with Treasury Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke. During those meetings, the federal government officials pressured Bank of America not to seek to rescind the merger agreement. We do not yet have a complete picture of the Federal Reserve's role in these matters because the Federal Reserve has invoked the bank examination privilege.     Bank of America's attempt to exit the merger came to a halt on December 21, 2008. That day, Lewis informed Secretary Paulson that Bank of America still wanted to exit the merger agreement.  According to Lewis, Secretary Paulson then advised Lewis that, if Bank of America invoked the MAC, its management and Board would be replaced "    Text of Cuomo letter on Merrill Lynch takeover - MarketWatch      (MAC: material adverse event)     Read Cuomo's entire letter. Bernanke and Paulson heavily pressured Lewis to screw BofA's shareholders and bondholders.
