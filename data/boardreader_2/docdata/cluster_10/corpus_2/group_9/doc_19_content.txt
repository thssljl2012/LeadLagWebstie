This article is a little too passive for my tastes.  I prefer the shorter AP article:       http://finance.yahoo.com/news/BofAs-...-15012902.html       "CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (AP) --  New York 's attorney general says government officials pressured Bank of America's CEO Ken Lewis to complete the bank's purchase of Merrill Lynch and threatened his job security.      A letter from  New York  Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office released Thursday said Lewis testified in February that former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke threatened to oust Bank of America's management if the bank tried to back out of buying the investment bank."
