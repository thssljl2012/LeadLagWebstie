Heard on NPR on the drive home that the SEC is looking in to possibly prosecuting Bernanke and Paulson for strong-arming Ken Lewis of Bank of America into going along with the buyout of Merrill Lynch!      Lewis is saying that Paulson was under orders from Bernanke to force him to accept the deal, or else, and then lie about the Merrill Lynch's losses.       On NPR, they were saying that if true, this is criminal and Bernanke and Paulson could face criminal charges!      This couldn't come at a better time! This should provide even more support for H.R. 1207!       Marketwatch: Bernanke and Paulson look foolish          Quote:                         As for Paulson, his legacy is further tarnished by the heavy-handed tactics charged by Lewis. Paulson's alleged wishes that the backroom agreement would not be a "disclosable event," or that he would remove the board of a public company, suggest power run amok.       Bernanke's reputation is tarnished worse. He stepped aside and let Paulson play bad cop even though he clearly had doubts about how the Bank of America situation was being handled. Bernanke still leads the Fed.       But his influence and judgment have suffered self-inflicted wounds.
