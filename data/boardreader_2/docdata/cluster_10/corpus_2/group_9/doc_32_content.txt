Explosive news out Thursday: Government officials acted like thugs last December, twisting Ken Lewis' arm until he agreed to keep Merrill Lynch. And Lewis sold out Bank of America (BAC) shareholders in order to keep his job. The details came out after New York's attorney general began investigating last year's merger between Bank of America and Merrill Lynch -- particularly the big bonus payments Merrill gave after the deal was done. The investigation (full report here) found that Lewis wanted out of the Merrill deal -- seeing as how Merrill's financials were garbage. In fact, Merrill had lost several billion dollars in the two weeks after the merger was approved by B of A shareholders.
