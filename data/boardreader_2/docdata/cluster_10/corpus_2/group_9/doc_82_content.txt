         Hi Guys,    http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/25/business/economy/25bank.ht...     On Friday, Morgan Stanley came forward with its own analysis of which banks might need to raise capital, the latest in a series of private estimates being tallied to allow gambling investors to position themselves to profit from fluctuations in the stock prices of the banks.  The report identified SunTrust, KeyCorp and Regions Financial  all major regional banks  as those that the government would probably determine needed billions in additional capital. Bank of America and Wells Fargo fall into a gray zone, the report said. Earlier this week, Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods, a boutique investment bank, said all of the 19 banks might need a total of $1 trillion of fresh capital.    The prospects of the remaining lenders are even more unclear. Their fate rests wherever federal banking regulators draw the line on how much capital is enough to provide a cushion. Big credit card lenders, like American Express and Capital One, have huge numbers of customers defaulting on their bills, but they typically set aside more money to cover losses than traditional banks. The BB&amp;T Corporation of North Carolina, PNC Financial and Wells Fargo all showcased their ability to generate earnings in the first quarter, but face a coming wave of heavy losses. MetLife Bank, which is part of the insurance giant, is also a wild card.    Sold my BBT last Friday on the big run-up, so that's now in cash.   rk(still a bank bagholder)
