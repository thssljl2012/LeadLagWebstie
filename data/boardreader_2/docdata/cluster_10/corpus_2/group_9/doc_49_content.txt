           Key loss assumptions in the 'adverse' scenario of 10.3% unemployment:  8.5% losses on first-lien mortgages 11% on HELOCs 8% on C+I loans 12% on CRE [typical range of experts is 10-20%, or more] 20% on CCs.  Apply these figs to the banks we've been talking about.    All right let's use the Y-9C reports from 12/31.  That's because we get standardized reporting and detailed categorization of loans that I'm not always finding in the individual earnings releases.  In a few weeks, the 3/31 data will be up and we can update the numbers -- although by then we may have the stress test results in some form. Note that delinquencies are 30-89 day accruing, 90+ day accruing and non-accruing loans for these stress test categories only.  I feel that by comparing the generic loss rates to the actual delinquencies in these same categories, one gets a feel for credit underwriting quality.  USB seems way ahead in this regard, WFC and JPM are close together with BAC and C bringing up the rear among the big banks.                       2-YR LOSS vs BANK              DELINQUENCIES  Wells Fargo            57.2% JPMorgan Chase         57.3% Bank of America        62.4% Citigroup              68.6% US Bancorp             41.4%    Wells Fargo    2-year Loan Loss Analysis  Loan Category              Total         2-year                            Loans         Losses  First-Liens              $248,579        $21,129 ex: Govt-guaranteed                     ($ 6,767) HELOCs                   $103,812        $11,419 C&amp;I                      $184,957        $14,797 CRE                      $ 85,985        $10,318 Credit Cards             $ 23,960        $ 4,792   Total 2-year Loss                        $55,688 Total Delinquencies                      $31,867 (57.2%)    JPMorgan Chase 2-year Loan Loss Analysis  Loan Category              Total         2-year                            Loans         Losses  First-Liens              $168,072        $14,286 ex: Govt-guaranteed                     ($ 2,597) HELOCs                   $111,502        $12,265 C&amp;I                      $151,237        $12,099 CRE                      $ 24,102        $ 2,892 Credit Cards             $ 94,051        $18,810   Total 2-year Loss                        $57,756 Total Delinquencies                      $33,104 (57.3%)    Bank of America 2-year Loan Loss Analysis  Loan Category              Total         2-year                            Loans         Losses  First-Liens              $280,724        $23,862 ex: Govt-guaranteed                     ($   998) HELOCs                   $112,745        $12,402 C&amp;I                      $188,846        $15,108 CRE                      $ 53,592        $ 6,431 Credit Cards             $ 81,274        $16,255   Total 2-year Loss                        $73,060 Total Delinquencies                      $45,600 (62.4%)    Citigroup       2-year Loan Loss Analysis  Loan Category              Total         2-year                            Loans         Losses  First-Liens              $151,591        $12,885 ex: Govt-guaranteed                     ($ 3,356) HELOCs                   $ 31,404        $ 3,454 C&amp;I                      $153,270        $12,262 CRE                      $ 12,568        $ 1,508 Credit Cards             $ 79,722        $15,944   Total 2-year Loss                        $42,598 Total Delinquencies                      $29,210 (68.6%)    US Bancorp       2-year Loan Loss Analysis  Loan Category              Total         2-year                            Loans         Losses  First-Liens              $ 34,106        $ 2,899 ex: Govt-guaranteed                     ($   641) HELOCs                   $ 15,318        $ 1,685 C&amp;I                      $ 41,983        $ 3,359 CRE                      $ 19,494        $ 2,339 Credit Cards             $ 13,520        $ 2,704   Total 2-year Loss                        $12,345 Total Delinquencies                      $ 5,110 (41.4%)    wabuffo
