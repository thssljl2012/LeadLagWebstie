Bank of America Corp. said Sunday that it isn't discussing a larger ownership stake for the government. "There are no talks right now over common stock conversion issue," said Bank of America spokesman Robert Stickler. "We see no reason to do that. We believe the goal of public policy should be to attract private capital into the bank, not to discourage it."
