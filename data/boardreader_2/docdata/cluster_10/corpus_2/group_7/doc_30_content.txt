Cohan, a former senior-level M&amp;A banker on Wall Street, is the author of The Last Tycoons: The Secret History of Lazard Freres &amp; Co.

No wonder they have no credibility.  So why are our largest money-center banksyou know, the ones that are supposed to be the survivors of the financial crisis, like JPMorganChase, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Wells Fargoin the process of a further, and possibly fatal, meltdown? Last week alone, Citigroups stock fell by one-third, JPMorgans fell 13 percent, and the shares of Bank of America and Wells Fargo each fell by 25 percent.  With apologies to economist Nouriel Roubini, the Dr. Doom of the financial crisis, the reason for the continuing collapse in the financial sector is not that the prospect of nationalization looms large for these money-center banks, although if that were to happen, shareholders would be wiped out in much the same fashion as those of AIG. Rather, the reason for the downward spiral is that, incredibly, some 20 months into the crisis, credibility is still the most acute problem facing the banks. We still dont know the extent of the toxicity of the assets on their books and, in many cases but not all, we no longer trust the people who run these institutions to tell us the truth about the danger lurking therein. Until the trust in these institutions is restored, and soon, there can be no equity or franchise value, regardless of whether the government or the existing shareholders owns the equity.  It shameful that Bank of America chairman and CEO Ken Lewis has no capacity to admit that his decision to buy both Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch was beyond irresponsible.  And frankly, at the moment, why should we trust these erstwhile leaders? Some of these are the very menwould that a few women were in charge!who got us into this mess in the first place. Not only should many of them been dismissed months ago, but they also seem unable to fess up to their collective roles in the disaster.  more...   http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-02-...
