  quote:    Stressing Out The Banks    Tim Geithner's plans to separate weak banks from strong are freaking out financials. What to expect.  The Treasury Department's plan to stress-test the capital levels of the top 15 U.S. banks is seriously stressing out the financial markets.  The goal is to find out whether the banks would have the capital they needed to continue to lend and absorb more losses if the economy were to weaken more than expected. Some outside observers of the Treasury's new Financial Stability Plan said last week it seemed likely the regulators were imposing stricter capital standards on banks, though the Treasury denied raising that bar.  Uncertainty over the plan is taking its toll on banks. Shares of the top U.S. banks, those that will have to submit to the stress testing, fell sharply Tuesday, including 11% declines in shares of Citigroup (nyse: C - news - people ), Bank of America (nyse: BAC - news - people ), and Goldman Sachs (nyse: GS - news - people ); a 12% decline in JPMorgan Chase (nyse: JPM - news - people ); and 13% declines in Morgan Stanley (nyse: MS - news - people ) and Wells Fargo (nyse: WFC - news - people ).  The administration is "so scared of looking silly and being taken advantage of by Wall Street that they're being excessively cautious," says Reed Auerbach, a structured finance attorney at McKee Nelson.
