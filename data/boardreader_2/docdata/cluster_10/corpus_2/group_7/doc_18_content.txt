Analysts at Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods said Thursday that by their estimate, 11 of the nation's biggest banks face the need to sell up to $116 billion of new common stock to meet capital requirements under a U.S. plan to stress test the industry.       And, Goldman Sachs, in it own research report late Wednesday said that the planned government intervention is better for lenders than for borrowers. Goldman also said it expects bank losses to continue, and that in their estimate the sector has recorded only half the losses it must take.       "We forecast $2.1 trillion of losses from U.S. credit this cycle, or a roughly 9% cumulative loss rate," Goldman said. "About $1.1 trillion of losses have been announced to date, or about half of our total estimate, with about 80% of these losses showing up at US institutions and the remainder showing up primarily in Europe," Goldman concluded.       Bank and financial sector are again losing confidence that the government and industry will be able to come up with a plan to solve the banking crisis, and they are expecting continued losses and stresses at banks.       CNBC's Charlie Gasparino reported on Thursday that Goldman Sachs earlier this week had a meeting with several big private sector investors and clients to discuss the plan unveiled Monday by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.       Part of that plan called for the private sector to partner with the government to buy up troubled assets from the banks.       Gasparino reported that Goldman and other attendees at the meeting are concerned with the lack of detail about the plan, and they are said to believe that more details and faster action are called for.    "Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., Bain Capital LLC, Perry Capital, Putnam Investments, and Citadel Investment Group LLC were all reported to be at the meeting.       Among U.S. banks, Regions Financial lost 10%, while Fifth Third fell 14%. Shares of Wells Fargo dropped 12%, and J.P. Morgan declined 7%. Bank of America shed 9%, and Citigroup was off 6%.
