By Larry Swing Overnight Global News    Global stock markets are trading at 5-week lows with The European DJ Stoxx 50 this morning down -0.23% and March S&amp;Ps down -3.00 points (-0.36%). Asia-Pacific stocks closed sharply lower today with Japan -4.92%, Hong Kong -3.37%, China -0.02%, Taiwan -4.44%, Australia -4.27%, Singapore -3.44%, South Korea -6.12%, India -3.45%. Nov Japanese machine orders, an indicator for capital spending in the next 3 to 6 months, tumbled by a record -16.2% m/m, the biggest decline since the survey began in 1987. Japan's Advantest Corp., the world's number-one maker of memory-chip testing equipment, fell 9.8% while South Korea's Samsung Electronics, the world's largest television maker, lost 6.1%. Asian banking shares declined as well with Woori Financial, operator of South Korea's second-largest bank, plunging 11%, Mizuho Financial Group, Japan's third-largest bank, dropping 5.5% and Fubon Financial Holding, Taiwan's second-largest listed financial services company, losing 6.9%. Slumping metals prices and surging metal inventories are taking their toll on global mining companies with BHP, the world's largest mining company, losing 6.6%, Rio Tinto Group, the third-largest, plunging 8.2% and Australia's Alumina falling 8.5%. Japanese aluminum stockpiles climbed 17% in Dec to a 3-year high while LME copper inventories have risen 14% this year to a nearly 5-year high. South Korea's largest automaker Hyundai Motor slid 10% and its affiliate Kia Motors slumped 11% after Fitch Ratings today cut both companies debt to junk levels on waning global auto sales. In Europe today, ASML, Europe's largest maker of semiconductor equipment, fell over 4% and dragged other European tech companies lower after saying revenue this quarter will be between 180 and 200 million euros this quarter, lower than the company's Dec forecast of 250 million euros. European inflation dropped to a 2-year low of +1.6% y/y in Dec, giving the ECB enough cover to cut interest rates as the market expects a 50 bp cut today at the conclusion of their policy meeting.   Unemployment claims Today's weekly initial unemployment claims report is expected to show an increase of +38,000 to 505,000, more than reversing last week's decline of 24,000 to 467,000. Meanwhile, weekly continuing claims are expected to rise +9,000 to 4.620 million, adding to last week's surge of +101,000 to 4.611 million. Initial unemployment claims have fallen sharply from the recent 26-year high of 589,000, but remain in high territory that indicates that layoffs are still running at a high level. Continuing claims last week hit a new 26-year high and are now just mildly below the record high for the series of 4.713 million posted in 1982. That indicates how quickly the ranks of the unemployed are adding up, thus causing general despair and a sharp cutback in spending.   PPI Today's Dec PPI report is expected to decline by 2.0% m/m, adding to the sharp decline of 2.2% m/m seen in November. The Dec core PPI (ex-food and energy) is expected to show a small increase of +0.1% m/m, matching November's increase of +0.1% m/m. On a year-on-year basis, the PPI plunged from the 17-1/2 year high of +9.9% in July 2008 to the +0.4% level seen in November. The record low for the PPI is 2.9% posted in 2002. Today's Dec core PPI report is expected to ease to +4.1% y/y from the 19-1/2 year high of +4.2% y/y in November. The PPI figures will continue dropping sharply in coming months, illustrating that the Fed at present is mainly facing a threat from deflation.   NY and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index Today's manufacturing indexes from NY and Philadelphia are expected to show little change and remain in deeply-negative territory, illustrating the recessionary conditions in the NY and Philadelphia manufacturing areas. Today's Jan Empire manufacturing index is expected to show a small increase of +0.8 to -25.0, more than reversing December's small decline of 0.4 to 25.8. Today's Jan Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index is expected to fall 2.1 points to 35.0, reversing part of December's modest upward rebound of +6.4 points to 32.9. The US manufacturing sector as a whole is clearly in recession and is suffering not only from weak domestic demand but also from a drop-off in overseas demand for US manufactured exports  Overnight U.S. Stock News    March S&amp;Ps this morning are down -3.00 points as shares of Apple and Bank of America tumble.

Apple (AAPL) fell 7.7% in after-hours trading yesterday after CEO Steve Jobs said he will take a medical leave of absence until June.
