  Read it and weep, Phil Gramm. Huge props to Think Progress for showing me that I am not, in fact, making up the economic frustrations I deal with every day. Here are the '10 Reasons Why Your Economic Pain Is Not Mental':HOUSING FORECLOSURES INCREASING: As a result of the subprime lending crisis, &amp;#8220;housing foreclosures nationwide were up 50% in June compared with the same month in 2007.&amp;#8221; In California alone, foreclosures have reached an average of 500 per day.HOMELESSNESS INCREASING: The number of homeless over the age of 50 are &amp;#8220;steadily increasing.&amp;#8221;HEALTHCARE COSTS RISING: According to a report by the Government Accountability Office, &amp;#8220;health-care costs are growing much faster than the economy.&amp;#8221; Costs are rising so significantly, some Americans are delaying retirement.GAS PRICES RISING: The national average gas price is $4.09, up 33% from this time last year. Gas prices are now expected to hit &amp;#8220;$4.25 by the fall and then stay at more than $4 a gallon until the end of 2009.&amp;#8221;JOB LOSSES INCREASING: In the first six months of this year, a total of 438,000 jobs have been lost, bringing unemployment to 5.5%. The CEO of Bank of America commented, if unemployment continues to rise, &amp;#8220;all bets are off.&amp;#8221;FOOD COSTS RISING: &amp;#8220;U.S. food prices rose 4 percent in 2007&amp;#8243; making it the fastest rise in 17 years and, as a result, food stamps have considerably less buying power.HEATING AND ELECTRICITY COSTS RISING: Heating oil costs across the north are expected to be &amp;#8220;up 60 percent from last year&amp;#8221; and utilities across the country are &amp;#8220;raising power prices up to 29%.&amp;#8221;REAL WAGES DECLINING: &amp;#8220;Slower wage growth and faster inflation has led to falling real hourly and weekly earnings for most workers.&amp;#8221;LEISURE SPENDING DECLINING: As a result of the rising cost of living, Americans are &amp;#8220;tightening their belts and thinking twice about spending extra bucks on entertainment and leisure products.&amp;#8221;VALUE OF DOLLAR DECLINING: The dollar &amp;#8220;has been declining steadily for six years against other major currencies, undercutting its role as the leading international banking currency.&amp;#8221;438,000 jobs lost as the cost of living skyrockets. We need change QUICKLY. The average American knows that. John McCain and his buddies continually show a lack of knowledge and a shocking disregard for the economic issues that face millions of families. It could get a lot worse. If McCain wins in November I'll eat my hat.
