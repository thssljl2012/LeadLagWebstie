  The Federal Reserve put into force liquidity measures with repeated interest rate cuts and lowered interest rates for banks for overnight loans from 2,25% to 2% (Fed Funds rate) and the discount rate from 2,50% to 2,25% (Federal Discount rate), taking into account the poor economic growth of only 0,6% on an annualized basis in the first quarter, declines in consumer spending, housing prices and business investment, along with spreading unemployment reaching 5,5% in May, staying steady at 5,5% in June and expecting to peak 6,4% in 2009. With the US economy in a serious slowdown, dropping consumer confidence to the lowest in 28 years, falling again sharply in June, as anxious shoppers grapple with surging food and fuel costs and sales of new cars and trucks plunged to their lowest level in more than a decade, there is an increasing awareness that the US economy is exposed to economic contraction, entering into a soft recession, but might still grow up to 1,3%  - the IMF sees zero US growth - this year, reviving only gradually to hit 2% in 2009, while world growth in the present year could reach 4,1%, but also fall below 3%, a level some consider would represent a global recession. The European Central Bank/ECB, alarmed about inflation trends, especially with oil prices soaring to unpredictable highs, combined with a lower growth increasing stagflation fears in the Eurozone, raised its main interest rate from 4% to 4,25% and considering rising inflation risks another rate increase to 4,5% in September is still possible. Especially oil (energy) and gold (metals) and other commodities, such as agricultural commodities, are used as hedge against inflation and the weakening Dollar, as rising commodity prices will offset dollar declines. Since the subprime mortgage crisis Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF), flush with cash thanks to high oil prices and surging Asian exports, already injected almost 9 Billion on recapitalizing the rich world&amp;#8217;s biggest investment banks (Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, UBS, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Standard Chartered, HSBC), &amp;#8216;the rescue of capitalism&amp;#8217; 11%  to ,09 Billion amid credit losses, withstanding the turmoil in the credit market better than other banks, as Morgan Stanley reported also a second quarter net income of ,026 Billion, but down from ,363 Billion/57% a year ago. Citigroup posted a ,5 Billion second quarter loss, reporting mortgage and credit related costs of 1,7 Billion, having lost more than 7 Billion in the last three quarters and taken about 5 Billion in writedowns and increased credit costs since mid-2007. Merrill Lynch reported for the same period a ,65 Billion loss, taking ,4 Billion in additional writedowns of troubled assets, posting losses of about 9 Billion for the past four quarters, having taken a total of 6,1 Billion in writedowns since the beginning of the crisis, and is planning the sale of its 20% Bloomberg stake worth about ,43 Billion and its controlling interest in Financial Data Services with an enterprise value of about ,5 Billion to raise capital, not selling for now a portion of its 49% Black Rock stake worth some 0 Billion, even as more bad debt is on the horizon; Wells Fargo, the biggest bank of the west Coast, said second quarter profit dropped 23% to ,75 Billion, a smaller decline than expected, while J.P.Morgan Chase posted a 54% plunge to  Billion for its same period net income, down from ,23 Billion a year earlier, saying it will take total charges and other related expenses of about 0,5 Billion to clean up the balance sheet of Bear Stearns, the troubled investment bank bought earlier this year, but resisting better a tough market and credit environment. Bank of America, which acquired the troubled mortgage giant Countrywide earlier this year, reported a second quarter net income of ,41 Billion, down 41% a year ago, tripling credit loss provisions to ,83 Billion from ,81 Billion last year, as further charge-offs are expected for several more quarters. willingness to take a partial loss on loan/s, an overhaul of the Federal Housing Administration, stronger regulations of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, giving them a permanent authority to increase home loans from 17.000 to 25.000, 5 Billion in housing-related tax incentives, including a refundable tax credit of up to .500 or 10% of the purchase price for first home owners on purchase of unoccupied housing to slow the fall of plunging home prices, an amount of 50 Million to expand counseling for borrowers to prevent foreclosure, establishing stricter disclosure rules and payment requirements for lenders, a Housing Trust Fund to cover expenses related to the foreclosure rescue plan for three years to be used to create affordable rental housing and a ,9 Billion emergency aid to stabilize hard-hit communities by purchasing vacant and foreclosed properties. Due to their unprecedented losses, 1 Billion in the last nine months, expecting new quarterly losses as foreclosures continue, the Treasury Department took two steps to stabilize and rescue troubled housing finance companies, which could cost over 5 Billion for the next two years, making plans to increase the amount they can borrow from the Government and enabling the Government to directly invest in the firms if conditions get worse, suggesting the creation of a new regulatory agency the Federal Housing Finance Agency; United Nations officials say the food crisis, worsened by soaring energy and food prices, could cost up to 0 Billion, emerging the impact of biofuels on food prices as a critical issue to government policies diverting food crops to energy use, and putting some nations in the difficult position to guarantee food for the poor and maintain economic growth. The largest share of final demand at around 70%/4 Billion, comes from jewellery, accounting India, the world&amp;#8217;s largest gold jewellery market by volume for around 555 t, followed in terms of consumption demand by the United States, the global second largest gold jewellery market with 306 t, China with 302 t, the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Dubai), Turkey and Italy.Crude oil 23,43 per barrel - 07/27/08     (Investment Banks price forecast 50,- up to 00 a barrel, OPEC President Khelil was quoted oil price could rise as high as 70 per barrel this summer, before pulling back, while OPEC mentiones an oil price range from 13 a barrel to as high as 86 a barrel by 2030, and GAZPROM, Russia&amp;#8217;s gas monopoly, predicted oil price could hit 50 a barrel in 2009. But there are also a few predictions oil price could fall below 05 in 2009, as soon as geopolitical tensions in oil producing countries cease.) &amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;-2.b) OilThe soaring crude oil price reflects tight inventories, shortage of refinery capacity, nervousness about political and military tensions in oil producing nations, refiners paying record premiums for the high quality crude oil they use to produce diesel and petrol, a decrease in the Dollar&amp;#8217;s value and above all, a flood of investments especially from pension and hedge funds, flowing into commodities, including oil, viewed as an attractive alternative investment to Dollars and hedge against the weaker US-currency. oil supply is enough and high oil prices are not due to a shortage of crude. According to the International Energy Agency/IEA global demand in 2008 will grow about 890.000 barrels a day to 86,87 Million barrels a day with a major oil demand of nearly 5,5% from China, and slow down in 2009 increasing by 860.000 barrels a day to 87,73 Million barrels a day, reaching 89,2 Million barrels a day by 2010, coming 51,8 Million barrels a day from NON OPEC oil production and 37,4 Million barrels a day from OPEC nations, rising oil demand by 2030 to 113,3 Million barrels a day. Global oil output reached 86,64 Million barrels a day in March and 86,11 Million barrels a day in April, the shortfall beeing taken out of the big inventories, about 3,5 Billion barrels in the OECD countries, which does not include China. OPEC will spend up to 60 Billion over the next four years to increase oil production capacity and is somehow worried that future oil demand might not be strong enough to justify huge investments to rise further output, increasing production cost, insisting that availability is not an issue but the real issue is deliverabilty of the required oil. The organization is considering that the current rise in oil prices is in nobody&amp;#8217;s interest and that we have to follow the evaluation of the Dollar, as the crude oil price is tied to this currency, because 1% fall in the Dollar means four Dollars more in the price of oil! Experts predict the oil market will remain tight and a nearing peak of the world oil production is going to signal at least a temporary end of cheap oil, requiring to price oil realistically to control demand. China/-3,77 is also net oil importer, while Canada/ 1,01 is a smaller net oil exporter. Canada has over 170 Billion barrels of recoverable bitumen from oil sands with today&amp;#8217;s tecnology and Alberta oil sands with an estimated total bitumen reserve between 1,7 Trillion and 2,5 Trillion barrels, more than the total OPEC oil reserves of about 900 Billion barrels, are for decades not considered part of the world&amp;#8217;s oil reserves because the oil there wasn&amp;#8217;t economically extractable at prevailing prices but could become the most important source of new oil in the world in coming years. There are also expectations Arctic may hold as much as 90 Billion barrels or 13% of the world&amp;#8217;s undiscovered oil and 30% of the world&amp;#8217;s undiscovered gas reserves. the greatest increases were expected from Russia and Brazil, however Russia, the world&amp;#8217;s second biggest oil producer, shows actually a declining oil production, and some believe that the per...
