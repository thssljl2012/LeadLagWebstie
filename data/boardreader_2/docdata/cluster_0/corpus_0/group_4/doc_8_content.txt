Thursday 20 November 2008by: Jack Healy, The New York Times              Markets tumbled for a second consecutive day, closing at a five-year low. (Photo:    UPI)     Wall Street doubled down on its losses on Thursday, just    a day after financial markets closed at their lowest point in nearly six years.     In a day dominated by fear and uncertainty, financial markets plunged in late    trading, carving new lows, in a melee of selling that cut across every sector    of the market. Energy companies took the heaviest blows as the price of crude    oil fell below $50 a barrel, and financial stocks sank sharply on fears that    billions in government aid have done little to cure the financial and credit    crises.     "The market can only take so many punches," said Quincy Krosby,    chief investment strategist at The Hartford. "This market needs a break.    It needs clarity. The question is, when and how much?"     No one had an answer on Thursday afternoon.     The Dow Jones industrial average set another new low for the year on Thursday,    shedding 444.99 points or 5.5 percent to close at 7,552.29. The wider Standard    &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell an even steeper 6.7 percent, adding    to its losses after tumbling 6 percent on Wednesday.     After Thursday, the S.&amp;P. index had dropped beneath its bear-market lows    of 2002, and was lower than any point since 1997.     As stocks hopped from red to green and back again before beginning their final    spiral, investors continued to seek cover in safe havens like Treasury notes    and gold, driving those prices higher. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury    dropped to 3 percent in a sign of how many investors are seeking shelters for    their money.     And a new report that jobless claims had crested to their highest levels in    16 years reminded investors that the frail economy continues to weaken.     "We think it's going to continue to go lower," said Ryan    Detrick of Schaeffer's Investment Research. "We don't think    people are scared enough. They're just not showing enough fear. People    are numb to this, they're almost immune to it."     Financial shares, which took the brunt of Wednesday's losses, continued    their bad streak on Thursday. Citigroup fell by double digits for a second day,    to less than $5 a share, despite news that Prince al-Walid bin Talal of Saudi    Arabia was increasing his stake in the troubled banking giant to 5 percent.    Citigroup closed down 26 percent.     Financial companies including J.P Morgan, the Bank of America, Morgan Stanley    and Merrill Lynch all lost more than 10 percent.     Shares in America's two largest automakers finished higher after Congressional    leaders said any proposal to bail out the auto industry would fail if it were    put to a vote this week. Democratic leaders from the House and Senate criticized    the executives of Ford, Chrysler and General Motors, and said the automakers    needed to make a more persuasive case that they would be responsible stewards    of $25 billion in federal aid.     On Thursday, new government data reinforced the economic gloom on Wall Street.    the Labor Department reported that new claims for unemployment benefits rose    to a seasonally adjusted 542,000 last week, the highest level since July 1992.    On Capitol Hill, the Senate was expected to take up a bill extending unemployment    assistance to people whose benefits have expired.     Economists said the swelling jobless numbers were creating a vicious circle    between Wall Street's losses and the afflictions of the broader economy.     "The profit drag on corporate America is widening and deepening, and    this is leading to more layoffs and cutbacks in capital spending, which is extending    and deepening the recession," said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist    for J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "We've gotten into a full-blown, self-feeding    downturn."     Investors sold off early Wednesday after confronting data that showed an unexpectedly    large drop in consumer prices, which suggested deflation could become the newest    problem for policy makers. The Dow fell more than 5 percent Wednesday while    the Nasdaq fell more than 6 percent.     "The problem is there is absolutely no silver lining visible,"    said Arjuna Mahendran, head of Asian investment strategy at HSBC Private Bank    in Singapore. "The financial crisis may now be at its tail end and we    are now in a second phase where corporate distress is the key issue. A third    phase may come early next year, when emerging markets will really struggle as    the crisis widens and exports continue to shrink."     Oil prices slipped below $50 a barrel, settling at $49.62 a barrel, down 7    percent.     In Europe, the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue    chips, closed down 3 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London was down 3.2    percent. The CAC 40 in Paris declined 3.4 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt    3 percent     Credit markets remained tight. The so-called Ted spread, the gap between yields    on safe three-month United States government securities and the rate that banks    charge one another for loans of the same duration, was unchanged at 2.11 percentage    points. The spread is well down from its peak of 4.6 points on Oct. 10, but    the improvement in the credit markets has stalled over the last two weeks. Analysts    consider a level of 0.5 point to 1.0 point to be normal.     Asian markets stumbled badly. The Tokyo benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average    finished 6.9 percent lower, taking its loss to the year to nearly 50 percent.    Government data Thursday showed Japanese exports were down 7.7 percent in October    from a year earlier, the steepest decline since December 2001. The drop contributed    to Japan's $665.8 million trade deficit.     While a drop had been expected - overseas consumers have long been cutting    down on spending, and the yen's strength against other currencies makes    Japanese goods more expensive overseas - the amount of the decline does    not bode well for the wider economy.    --------     Bettina Wassener and David Jolly contributed reporting.
