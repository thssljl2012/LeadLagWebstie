                          Whatever games are played                      with us, we must play no games with ourselves.                                                         The                      games played in the stock market seemed to have given way                      for the day  Dhoni&amp;#8217;s                      dazzlers beat the sizzling Sensex! Dhoni &amp;amp;                      Co.'s historic win over Ricky Ponting-led Aussies seemed to                      outperform the events of the day. And rightly so, as we cannot                      ignore the fact that the rally (in the market) came on                      the worst traded turnover in 15 months. For the scores,                      the main indices surged by nearly 6% each, propelling the                      Sensex and the Nifty above 10k and 3k, respectively.                                                             We&amp;#8217;re back                      to the stock market game, which remains unpredictable till                      the end. There are no clear winners here as volatility rules.                      Today, we expect some cooling after Monday's strong rally,                      and weakness across global equities. Most players won't                      like to take undue risks at this stage, with Thursday being                      a public holiday, IIP data scheduled for tomorrow, and non-stop                      bad news coming from the global markets. Like in recent                      sessions, the markets could bounce back too. Wait for lower                      levels before buying. Don&amp;#8217;t try match winning techniques                      for the day. Instead, look at long term strategies to win                      the championship, which means enhancing your portfolio value.                                                                                   The dismal                      volume in the F&amp;amp;O segment on Monday was particularly disheartening.                      This shows that the bulls still don't have enough confidence                      to sustain any meaningful advance. What is needed is a                      strong comeback by the FIIs, which is not likely till risk                      aversion subsides substantially. This in turn hinges on how                      fast the global economy rebounds from what is now being seen                      as a long and painful recession.                                                                                    Back home                      too, things are not looking all that rosy, what with reports                      emerging of the first drop in exports in five years in October.                      Reports say India's merchandise exports are likely to have                      dipped by 15% last month. The official data will be out on                      Dec. 1. Talking of macroeconomics, auto sales slumped in                      September, led by commercial vehicles. The IIP data for                      September will be out and expectations are that it could jump                      to 5-7% from August's paltry 1.3%. Like we mentioned yesterday,                      there is no dearth of bad news, both locally and globally,                      and it is not possible to dwell upon each one of them. All                      one can say in short is that we are in one of the worst                      economic and financial environment in decades. And, the troubles                      may not be over soon and will keep rearing the ugly head every                      now and again.                    FIIs                      were net buyers of Rs923.3mn (provisional) in the cash segment                      on Monday while local institutions pumped in Rs3.77bn.                      In the F&amp;amp;O segment, they were net buyers at Rs2.09bn.                      On Friday, foreign funds were net buyers of Rs603mn in the                      cash segment. Mutual funds were net sellers at Rs817mn on                      the same day.                   US                      stocks sank on Monday, as a raft of bad news hinting at a                      worsening economic situation offset China's big-bang stimulus                      package, and the Bush government's revamped bailout deal                      for insurance giant AIG.                   The                      Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 73 points or 0.8% to end                      at 8,870.54 while the Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 index                      lost 12 points or 1.3% to close at 919. The Nasdaq Composite                      index shed 31 points or 1.9% to 1,616.                   All                      three major US indices had risen in the early trading, before                      abandoning gains and turning lower.                   Market                      breadth was negative. Almost three stocks dropped for each                      that advanced on the New York Stock Exchange.                   The                      government said it was restructuring AIG's bailout plan, buying                      US$40bn in preferred stock, reducing its original US$85bn                      bridge loan to US$60bn, and cutting the interest rate by 5.5%.                      The total reworked deal is worth about US$152.5bn. The reworking                      acknowledges that the initial plan was insufficient to reverse                      AIG's slide.                   Additionally,                      AIG reported a steep quarterly loss of US$24.5bn in the third                      quarter. Shares gained 8%.                   Fannie                      Mae reported a steep quarterly loss of US$29bn. A large portion                      of the loss was due to a change in the way it accounted for                      tax credits. But even excluding that, results were far worse                      than a year ago, due to bad mortgage bets. Its shares fell                      2.7%.                   Citigroup                      is reportedly in talks to buy an unnamed regional bank, in                      the aftermath of its failure to buy Wachovia last month, according                      to The Wall Street Journal. Citi's shares fell 5%.                   A                      number of financial stocks fell, including American Express,                      Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Merrill Lynch.                   Shares                      of leading automakers continued to plunge amid worries about                      their ability to stay afloat without government intervention.                      General Motors (GM) plummeted 23% and Ford lost 4.5%.                   Both                      companies, along with Chrysler, are seeking help from the                      US government. On Friday, GM posted a steep loss and said                      it is running out of cash.                    Deutsche                      Bank said shares of GM were likely worthless and that the                      company might not be able to fund its US business past December                      without the government's help.                   Package-delivery                      firm DHL became the latest corporation to announce massive                      layoffs. DHL said it will cut 9,500 jobs as it ends air and                      ground operations within the US, focusing only on deliveries                      between the US and other nations.                   Circuit                      City said last week that it would cut 17% of its domestic                      workforce and close 150 stores amid the sluggish economy and                      consumer spending slowdown. On Monday, the company filed for                      bankruptcy protection.                   On                      the upside, McDonald's said worldwide sales at stores open                      a year or more jumped 8.2% in October, thanks to overseas                      consumers and demand for cheap food amid the recession. Shares                      gained 1.8%.                   Telecom                      major Nortel Networks reported a quarterly loss versus a profit                      a year ago, and also said it was cutting 1,300 jobs. Shares                      fell 18.8%.                   After                      the close, Starbucks reported weaker earnings and higher revenue,                      both of which missed estimates. Shares declined about 3% in                      extended-hours trading.                   In                      global news, China announced a US$586bn stimulus package,                      aimed at tempering the impact of the global financial crisis.                   The                      dollar gained against the euro and fell versus the yen. COMEX                      gold for December delivery rallied US$11.40 to settle at US$745.60                      an ounce.                   US                      light crude oil for December delivery gained US$1.37 to settle                      at US$62.41 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.                   Gasoline                      prices fell another 1.9 cents to a national average of US$2.24                      a gallon. The decline marks the 54th consecutive day that                      prices have decreased. During that same time period, prices                      dropped by US$1.61 a gallon, or 41.9%.                   The                      credit market continued to improve. The 3-month Libor                      fell to 2.24% from 2.29% on Friday, a nearly four-year low.                      Overnight Libor inched higher to 0.35% from 0.33% Friday,                      after hitting an all-time low of 0.32% last week.
