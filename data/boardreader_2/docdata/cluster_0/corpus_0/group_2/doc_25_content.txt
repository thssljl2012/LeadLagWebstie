After a nice gain on Tuesday for the stock market, we took another drubbing today.  The DOW finished down 449 points today.  This did help our mortgage rates a little today because of the money coming out of stocks and into mortgage bonds.Yesterday I was surprised to see the rise in interest rates after the Fed decided to leave rates unchanged.

Today we saw rates come down about .125% because of the 449 point drop in the stock market.Here is an article about why the Fed did not do anything with rates.Why the Fed Didn't Cut the Funds Rate
