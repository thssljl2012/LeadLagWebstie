According to Yahoo!Singapore News:NEW YORK - Oil prices tumbled to a seven-month low Monday as the demise of Lehman Brothers and the sale of Merrill Lynch fed expectations of another big liquidation of commodities holdings.Crude's steep decline _ prices tumbled as much as $7 over the weekend _ also came as early signs suggested that Hurricane Ike delivered less damage than feared to the Gulf Coast energy oil and gas infrastructure.The sell-off in oil began Sunday and accelerated Monday as traders digested a day of dramatic upheaval on Wall Street: Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a 158-year-old investment bank, filed for bankruptcy after failing to find a buyer and Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. agreed to be bought out by Bank of America Corp.Lehman, Merrill and other big institutional investors were major participants in the commodities boom of the past year, helping push the price of oil, precious metals and grains to historic highs until a slowing global economy helped bring a halt to the rally.Analysts said investors feared that the upheaval in the financial sector could trigger another round of commodities liquidation _ especially with Lehman likely to unwind its holdings. Other investors may also unload commodities, fearing that the deepening economic crisis will further reduce demand for energy and raw materials futures.Also adding to the selling pressure Monday was a slightly stronger dollar. A rising greenback encourages investors to unload commodities bought as a hedge against inflation or weakness in the U.S. currency.Oil fell despite reports that militants have launched another attack Nigeria's oil infrastructure in a third day of violence.Read the full article at Yahoo!Singapore News- Rejoice for consumers as inflation most likely ease off slightly but with battered market as banks got their "Red Card" one after another by the economic referee, many may need to prepare for the inevitable.The fearsome word that starts with the capital letter "R", yes it's Recession and it may brings it's big brother "D" along for the ride.If "D" comes along, which means economic Depression, then expect more job loss and economic hardship globally. The effects will be much more direct and sudden, companies may face bankruptcies and retails shops may disappear overnight.We had already seen high oil prices caused Canadian Airlines to begin insolvency proceeding and halt their operations.Investment wise, do at your own risk. One of my friend is still sticking with STI Index and another shorting the market effectively making a small fortune for himself at a very high risk.What will happen in this transition period? Many may see this as the greatest opportunity of the life time to get great shares at the lowest possible price but do note that now even banks can be bankrupted...everything is possible now.However, if oil price drops below a certain value...let's say below the cost of production...it's quite possible that non-conventional oil like tar sands, ultra deep sea oil rigs and other expensive technology on old oil fields may suddenly becomes not profitable and may cease to operate.Production will cease and shortages will occur systematically and cause sudden surge in oil prices automatically. This "magic numbers" of the cost of oil threshold can be anything between U.S. $45 per barrel to $90 depending on what kind of technology or non-conventional oil we are talking about.Investors may call this the support value and if broken, we can expect immediate announcement of supply cuts from OPEC or Non-OPEC oil producing countries.Or this may be the trigger point for resource wars when resource protectionism starts to activates when the cost of productions goes beyond the margins of profits to exports and oil exporting countries may limit their exports purposely.Whatever the out comes may be, we might have a period of lower oil prices and volatile economy that may break millions of jobs overnight.Look out for that big Axe overhead!!!
