Housing starts fell 11 percent in July to an annual rate of 965,000, the Commerce Department said today in Washington. The Labor Department reported the producer price index jumped 9.8 percent from a year before. &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s no doubt we&amp;#8217;re in a period of stagflation now,&amp;#8221; said Peter Kretzmer, a senior economist at Bank of America Corp. in New York who formerly worked at both the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Fed Board in Washington. &amp;#8220;A recovery will not happen this year,&amp;#8221; said Russell Price, a senior economist at H&amp;amp;R Block Financial Advisors Inc. in Detroit. &amp;#8220;Not only are mortgage rates creeping up, but financing is becoming more difficult for a lot of people. Builders will continue to pull back.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;The recent burst of cost-push inflation is giving the beast digestion problems that might manifest themselves in the form of a lingering inflationary fever,&amp;#8221; Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said in a speech in Aspen, Colorado, today.
