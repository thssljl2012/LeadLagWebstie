    Challenge is a dragon with a gift in its                   mouth. Tame the dragon and the gift is yours.                   Despite the rise in                   volatility off late,                   the bulls have managed to hold off the challenge from                   the bears. The Sensex is up over 3% over last Friday's                   levels while the Nifty has gained 2.5%. Both the indices                   breached major milestones during the week, but have since come                   off those highs. The Sensex crossed 15,400 but slipped under                   15,000 briefly yesterday. The Nifty on the other hand crossed                   4600 but went below 4500 in intra-day trade yesterday.                    Things have also been                   volatile globally, with markets trying to break out of the                   protracted downturn, but unable to ignore the slew of                   headwinds. The trend is likely to remain choppy over the                   coming days in the absence of any major market moving events. The                   key indices are likely to be rangebound and will face                   resistance at higher levels, as they have rallied around                   20% over the past few weeks. Uncertainty continues over the                   local macro-economic factors and global scenario.                   The recent correction in                   crude oil is the only notable positive for the global markets                   and will continue to drive sentiment. Inflation and rising                   interest rates are the other key factors to watch out for.                   Having said that most of it has been discounted. We expect                   the market to be cautious at open as most global markets are                   down. Given the lack of big-ticket events, things will turn                   volatile later in the day.
