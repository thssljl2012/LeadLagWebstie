Pity poor OPEC. The oil cartel meets in Vienna Friday to try to figure out how to get the toothpaste back in the tube, as it studies a production cut that can halt crude oils price slide.   Saudi oil minister Ali Naimi holds all the cards (AP)  The problem, Barclays Bank says, is that OPEC is actually wrestling with three production cuts. Theres the cut that the oil market thinks it wants to see now. Then theres the production cut the oil market probably needs now. And then theres the production cut that, with hindsight, the market will have actually needed. And theyre all different numbers. The end result is likely to be a rockier roller-coaster ride, Barclays says: The market does not think that OPEC can tighten the market, but ultimately OPEC may well end up over-tightening it. Given that, we see a rising profile for prices next year, with a stronger [second half] as the over-tightening scenario plays out, producing an annual average for WTI of $105.20 per barrel. Even though some OPEC members such as Iran are calling for massive, immediate production cuts, OPECs decision will all boil down to what the Saudis want, argues Platts The Barrel. Which is more important to Riyadh? Keeping fellow OPEC member budgets in good shape, or keeping the world economy from going from bad to worse?
