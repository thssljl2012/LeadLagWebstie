Crude oil futures surged almost 10% Wednesday, breaching $67 a barrel. A delayed response to OPECs announcement of a production cut? Not likely. The market seems to believe that interest-rate cuts in the U.S. and China, and the prospect of rate cuts in other countries, will stave off the worst of the recession and restore oil demand quicker.    Oil-market savior (AP)  The U.S. cut interest rates back to 1% in a bid to jumpstart money flowing through the economy. But oil demand is still grimthe latest data out from the U.S. government showed gasoline demand over the last month was down about 8% from the same period last year. Of course, cutting interest rates might not do the trick. As the WSJ points out, Japan cut interest rates to zero, and still suffered a decade-long slump.  But if the concerted rate cuts do spur an earlier economic recovery, and goose slumping demand for oil, what happens to the price of crude next spring? Barclays Bank is convinced OPEC has already tightened the oil market more than it needed, and is setting the stage for a price rebound next year. And OPEC is still talking about further production cuts before the end of the year. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency is reportedly gloomy about the state of the worlds oil fields.  Would all that crimp oil supplies just as central-bank voodoo jumpstarts demand for oil again?
