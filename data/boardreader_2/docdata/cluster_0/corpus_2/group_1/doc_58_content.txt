                                         Quote:                          Originally Posted by  Real1ty                          Unemployment rate steady in July     August 07, 2008      THE number of people in full-time employment grew by 53,700 in July putting employment figures at odds with other data suggesting the economy is slowing sharply.      The Reserve Bank of Australia indicated this week that it was on the brink of ending a six-year run of interest rate hikes in light of evidence of an economic slowdown.      The total number of people employed in July rose by a seasonally-adjusted 10,900, but part-time jobs dropped 42,800, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said.                                             Whilst full-time employment grew strongly in July part-time work took a dive. Part-time employment falls are usually a harbinger of drops in full-time jobs. That said, this is just one month of data so not much can be read into it. Also the abs has revised the way it does the survey for the employment report and has basically reduced the sample size by about 25%. That means the standard error has increased. So basically, less stock can be put in the current months data and more attention should be placed on the revisions.
