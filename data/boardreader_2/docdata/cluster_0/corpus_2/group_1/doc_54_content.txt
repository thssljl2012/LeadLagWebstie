SYDNEY, Aug 5 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar fell sharply against the U.S. currency on Tuesday after the central bank said there was scope to move towards a less restrictive monetary policy, paving the way for future rate cuts.    The Aussie dollar  fell to $0.9238 against the U.S. dollar, it lowest in nearly four months, and down from $0.9280 before the statement was issued. It has fallen more than 6 percent from a 25-year high of $0.9851 hit in July.    The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept rates unchanged at a 12-year high of 7.25 percent, but said demand was likely to remain subdued and inflation would decline over time.    Australian bond futures rallied after the central bank statement. Three-year bond futures  rose 0.05 points to 94.07 while the 10-year bond contract  added 0.025 points to 93.985.
