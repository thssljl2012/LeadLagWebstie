LONDON (Thomson Financial) - Bank of England rate setters are expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Thursday as they continue to grapple with the twin evils of soaring inflation and a flagging economy.    All 24 of the economists polled by Thomson Financial News believe the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will keep the benchmark Bank Rate on hold at 5.00 percent.    The picture is very murky, however. Annual CPI inflation currently stands way above the BoE&amp;#039;s 2.0 percent target at 3.8 percent and is expected to rise further, but data on all other areas of the economy have pointed to a widespread slowdown, with recession looking an increasingly likely prospect.    Last week&amp;#039;s minutes to the July MPC meeting illustrated just how problematic the debate is, with Tim Besley voting to raise interest rates and David Blanchflower voting for a cut, while the remaining seven preferred to see rates staying unchanged.    &amp;#039;The three-way split in the MPC&amp;#039;s voting in July encapsulates the predicament that the Bank of England is in over a deepening and widening economic slowdown, yet elevated and still rising inflation,&amp;#039; said Howard Archer at Global Insight.    The divided vote leaves open the possibility of a surprise rate move on Thursday, which could be either up or down. The probability of this is low, however, particularly as so far no MPC member has chosen to join Blanchflower&amp;#039;s dovish camp, while the other arch hawk on the committee, Andrew Sentance, failed to join Besley in opting for a hike in July.    Economists are equally divided on the issue of whether interest rates will have changed by the end of the year, and if so in which direction.    Seventeen of the 24 polled believe that the BoE will be inclined to leave rates on hold for the rest of 2008 as high inflation prevents rate setters from cutting borrowing costs while a slowing economy prevents a move higher. Only next year, when inflationary pressures begin to ease will the Bank be in a position to cut rates.    Five, however, believe that the economic slowdown will be severe enough to prompt a rate cut during 2008, most likely in November.    &amp;#039;Until the situation is clear, the BoE will not do anything, but the economic situation is awful and inflation should start coming down in the fourth quarter,&amp;#039; said Neil Mellor at the Bank of New York, who forecasts rates at 4.75 percent by year-end.    To counter this, two believe soaring inflation will force the Bank to raise interest rates, with Monument Securities forecasting rates at 5.25 percent by year-end and Tradindex plumping for two hikes over that period, leaving the Bank rate at 5.50 percent.    &amp;#039;By the end of the year the inflationary pressures will be so great, the BoE will have to put up interest rates,&amp;#039; said Stephen Lewis at Monument Securities.    There is no indication that inflation is moderating in response to unchanged rates, and the longer rate setters fail to raise borrowing costs the more they risk damaging the central bank&amp;#039;s credibility, he argued.
