SYDNEY, Aug 25 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar fell towards recent seven-month lows against a firm U.S. currency on Monday, with investors wary that a global economic slowdown would dent demand for commodities.    * A 5.4 percent drop in crude oil  saw commodities pare some of their gains made earlier last week. Gold and industrial metals also eased and pulled the CRB commodities index  down 2.7 percent. Australia is a big exporter of resources.    * Investors have been unwinding long commodity and short U.S. dollar positions in the past few weeks amid growing concerns that the ripple effect of a slowdown in the United States was spilling over to other major economies. Gloomy British data backed those views [ID:nLM538422].    * By 9:20 a.m. the Aussie dollar  was at $0.8685/88 against the U.S. dollar, down from $0.8788/91 late here on Friday and not far from a seven-month low of $0.8590 struck earlier this month.    * Currency speculators continued to cut long Aussie dollar positions in favour of the U.S. currency. Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed investors cut net long positions to 5,950 contracts in the week to Aug. 19, down from 9,053 contracts a week earlier.[nN22304514]    * Investors have also been cutting their holdings in the Aussie on expectations of a rate cut next month. Futures  are fully pricing in a 25 basis point cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia early next month.    * Expectations of a rate cut offset better risk appetite. Stocks were boosted by falling oil prices, but the Aussie, which usually is bolstered by improved sentiment towards riskier assets, eased to 95.36 yen , from 95.62 yen late here on Friday.    * Australian bonds were lower as higher stock markets dimmed the attraction of less risky government bonds. They tracked U.S. Treasuries which also fell as investors unwound bids for safe-haven government bonds.    * Three-year bond futures  shed 0.045 points to 94.29, while the 10-year bond contract  fell 0.035 points to 94.20.
