WELLINGTON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - The New Zealand dollar  rebounded from one-year lows on Thursday as investors stepped in to buy the high-yielding currency at cheaper levels.    The kiwi fell to a low of $0.6824 on Wednesday as Japanese investors unwound leveraged positions in currencies like the New Zealand and Australian dollars funded in the cheap yen, though it bounced back to $0.7058  in offshore trade.    Bargain hunting, combined with wariness that a currency in freefall could make the central bank think twice about cutting interest rates again, saw the kiwi bob around the $0.70 cent level in local trade.    The market was now eyeing U.S. second-quarter inflation data due later on Thursday for direction, said Tim Kelleher, manager global markets at ASB bank.    &amp;#039;We&amp;#039;ve had a strong week in the U.S. dollar, so if there&amp;#039;s any weakness the kiwi should be able to squeeze a bit higher,&amp;#039; Kelleher said.    At 0500 GMT, the currency was at $0.6991/97, compared with $0.6892/98 in late local trade on Wednesday. It ranged between $0.6970 and $0.7039 in the local session.    Domestic second-quarter retail sales data is due on Friday, with a weak reading likely to bolster the case for a further rate cut at the central bank&amp;#039;s Sept. 11 policy meeting. A Reuters poll is forecasting sales volumes to have fallen 1.6 percent from the previous quarter.    The U.S. dollar racked up its 10th straight day of gains against a basket of currencies  on fears of a widespread slowdown in growth.    New Zealand bonds were flat, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond  unchanged at 6.19 percent.    An auction of long-dated government debt drew a yield of 6.28 percent on NZ$50 million of November 2011 bonds and 6.18 percent on NZ$50 million of December 2017 bonds.
