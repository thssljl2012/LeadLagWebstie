 Chuck Butler from Everbank had this to say about the RBA decision in his newsletter &amp;amp;quot;The Daily Pfennig&amp;amp;quot;:      &amp;amp;quot;The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) printed their last meeting minutes, and they revealed what the markets had priced into the A$... A forthcoming rate cut. Probably at the Sept 2nd meeting. The A$ has rebounded a bit, as the markets had begun t o price in a 50 BPS  rate cut,  whereas the meeting minutes point to a 25 BPS rate cut . However, what I read in the minutes tells me that a  follow up rate cut of 25 BPS  in October is  probably  in the books.&amp;amp;quot;      Cheers,         CanOz
