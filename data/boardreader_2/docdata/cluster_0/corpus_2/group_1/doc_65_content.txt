 Good to see that the Labor Party looks like it could do something in its first year that the Libs couldn&amp;#039;t in the last 7!        Rate cut could come as soon as next month       Renee Viellaris   August 12, 2008 12:00am       HOMEOWNERS could be blessed with mortgage relief for the first time in seven years after the RBA hinted interest rate cuts were imminent.      The Reserve Bank of Australia&amp;#039;s statement on monetary policy showed that although inflation remained high, the chances of a cut to its official cash rate were &amp;amp;quot;increasing&amp;amp;quot;.      It has sparked speculation the RBA could move as early as next month, although some economists predict the relief will most likely be a 0.25 percentage point cut in November.      The RBA has not cut its cash rate since December 2001, instead lashing homeowners with 12 consecutive rises to take it to 7.25 per cent.
