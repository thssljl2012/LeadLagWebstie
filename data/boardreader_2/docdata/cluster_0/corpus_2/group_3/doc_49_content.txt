SINGAPORE, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Gold rose for a fourth straight day on Thursday, rising 2 percent at one point, as oil extended gains and the dollar fell against the euro, which stirred hopes bullion could eventually regain $800 on safe-haven buying.    Other precious metals tracked gold higher, with firmer equities also helping prices move away from their multi-year lows. The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by half a percentage point on Wednesday, sending the U.S. dollar tumbling.    Gold was trading at $763.30 an ounce, up $9 an ounce from New York&amp;#039;s notional close on Wednesday, when it hit an intraday high of $773.40 an ounce.    &amp;#039;I think all the preconditions are there for gold to take a very healthy run. The physical demand for gold has actually exceeded the ability to supply right around the world,&amp;#039; Ian Smith, managing director of Newcrest Mining Ltd, told reporters in Melbourne.    Newcrest is Australia&amp;#039;s largest gold producer.    Gold plummeted to its weakest in 13 months at $680.80 on Friday after investors cashed in to cover losses in stock markets. It has bounced on strong oil, a recovery in equities, a firmer euro and tightness in physical gold supply after a recent drop in prices triggered buying from jewellers and investors.    &amp;#039;My view is that we&amp;#039;re likely to see the gold price continue to move higher in the near term,&amp;#039; said David Moore, commodities analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney.    &amp;#039;I mean it&amp;#039;ll probably follow a fairly uneven path but the underlying trend is for gold to be back above $800 an ounce by the end of this year,&amp;#039; he said.    Gold, which traded around $800 earlier this month, was still below a record high of $1,030.80 hit in March after a rally to a two-month high of $931 on Oct. 10 was met by heavy selling.    Oil rose more than $2 to above $69.50 barrel due to the dollar weakness after the Fed cut interest rates, which in theory boosts gold&amp;#039;s appeal as a hedge against inflation.    The euro rose against the dollar, recovering from a 2-1/2-year low hit this week, as the oil rally spurred investors to pick up currencies battered during a rapid slide in recent months from record highs near $150 in mid-July.    &amp;#039;The dollar seems to be on the downside and that helps gold. But I would say gold will still be trading in a very wide range of $700 to $800 an ounce,&amp;#039; said a dealer in Hong Kong.    Japan&amp;#039;s Nikkei average climbed more than 6 percent on bargain hunting.    Two of the world&amp;#039;s leading gold miners reported big drops in quarterly earnings on Wednesday as soaring costs for fuel and raw materials ate into margins already narrowed by a slumping gold price.    Platinum was trading at $821.50 ounce, up $28.00 from New York&amp;#039;s notional close.    New York gold futures added $9.9 an ounce to $763.9.
