TOKYO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - The yen fell against the euro and the Australian dollar on Monday as a crisis summit planned for next month helped the market to regain some stability and prompted investors to pick up the recently battered currencies.    South Korea was the latest country to join efforts to help stabilise markets, while the Dutch government agreed to pump some 10 billion euros ($13.41 billion) into ING, the country&amp;#039;s largest listed bank.[ID:nLJ592307]    But analysts said safety demand for the low-yielding yen was also intact as worries grew about deteriorating financial conditions in emerging markets after Iceland, Ukraine and Pakistan asked for aid to prop up their economies, slowing the yen&amp;#039;s fall.    &amp;#039;A slew of recent policy actions worldwide has provided some relief to the banking sectors in the major economies,&amp;#039; said Kengo Suzuki, a currency strategist at Shinko Securities.    &amp;#039;But the state of the market remains very fragile with worries mounting about the global economy and emerging markets,&amp;#039; Suzuki said.    The dollar was trading at 101.65 yen, nearly flat from late New York trade on Friday when more bleak U.S. data stoked fears that the credit crisis had knocked the economy into recession and pushed Wall Street shares down.    The Nikkei share average was up 1.8 percent in early trade.    The euro rose 0.3 percent against the yen to 136.73 yen after dipping as much as 0.3 percent in early Asian trade.    The German government has set strict conditions for banks planning to tap into its 500 billion euro rescue package, including limits on manager salaries, according to a draft of the law seen by Reuters.[ID:nLJ241789]    The draft law goes to the cabinet on Monday.    The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.3452 partly due to dollar selling against the Australian dollar, traders said.    The Aussie dollar rose against the dollar and the yen, helped by market speculation that the Australian central bank may not cut interest rates as aggressively as previously thought.    Weekend reports said the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) may hold interest rates steady at a Nov. 4 meeting.    The Aussie climbed 0.8 percent to $0.6965 and was up 0.8 percent against the yen at 70.78 yen.
