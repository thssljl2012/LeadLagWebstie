Crude for November delivery rose $3.09 to $90.92 a barrel in electronic trading on Globex.        Analysts at Sucden Research cited &amp;quot;technical buying and growing  optimism global central banks may cut rates to ease fears, after the  Reserve Bank of Australia slashed interest rates.&amp;quot;      &amp;quot;We seem to be drifting  in and out of panic mode,&amp;quot; said Edward Meir, an analyst at MF Global,  in a research note. He&amp;#039;s not bullish on crude making a stand at current  levels.      Australia&amp;#039;s  central bank implemented a larger-than-expected interest-rate of a full  percentage point amid a worsening financial-markets crisis worldwide.  See Asia Markets.          The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its benchmark policy interest rate by  a full percentage point, ponting to disarray in global financial  markets and mounting evidence of a sudden deceleration in economic  growth among major trading partners in Asia.      The move helped some  other stocks in Asia also rebound or pare losses, by fanning  expectations that other central banks -- including the European Central  Bank and the Federal Reserve -- could participate in coordinated  efforts to get the frozen global credit markets moving by slashing  their own policy rates.  See full story.         The Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar retreated in foreign-exchange  trading, giving back some of the previous day&amp;#039;s gains, after the  surprise rate cut by Australia. Dollar weakness typically boosts  dollar-denominated commodities such as oil and gold.  See Currencies.          On Monday, crude closed at $87.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile  Exchange, down 6.5% and near the session&amp;#039;s low. Prices haven&amp;#039;t seen  levels this low since Feb. 7.      &amp;quot;Buyers are sitting on  their hands, while sellers are liquidating positions and fleeing toward  the safety of cash,&amp;quot; Meir said. &amp;quot;However, despite the recent declines  amid very abnormal market conditions, we think that some commodity  markets -- like crude -- are still overextended, and have more room to  fall.&amp;quot;      Also on the Globex  Tuesday, November reformulated gasoline rose 4 cents to $2.10 a gallon  and November heating oil gained 5 cents to $2.53 a gallon.       Natural gas for November delivery gained 6 cents to $6.90 per million British thermal units.
