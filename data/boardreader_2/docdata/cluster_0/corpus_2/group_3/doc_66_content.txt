Annual inflation picked up to 4.5 percent, from 4.2 percent in August, further above the Reserve Bank of Australia&amp;#039;s (RBA) 2 to 3 percent target band.    * NEWS: The RBA added A$1.57 billion ($1.2 billion) in repurchase agreements, above an estimated daily need of A$1.195 billion, effectively adding A$375 million. That should keep banks&amp;#039; cash cushion with the RBA around an historically high A$9 billion.    ___________________________________  ____________________________    * The Australian dollar hovered just above 14-month lows against the U.S. dollar and held near a three-year trough versus the yen as investors stayed away from higher-yielding currencies amid heightened risk aversion.    * Regional stock markets fell on worries about a global economic slowdown, leading investors to pare leveraged carry trade positions. The Aussie was at 81.52 yen on Friday, not far from a three-year low of 80.97 yen struck offshore.    * Also weighing down on the Aussie were falling commodity prices. The CRB index fell 4.3 percent to its lowest point in a year on Thursday as investors dumped natural resources worried that a slowing global economy would slow demand.    * Shortly after midday, the Aussie had fallen to $0.7765, off a 14-month low of $0.7698 struck offshore, and weaker than $0.7875 late here on Thursday.    * It has lost nearly 8 percent this week on heightened risk aversion and expectations that tight credit conditions will force the central bank to cut rates by a hefty 50 basis points next week. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) decides on interest rates at a policy meeting on Oct. 7.    * Australian bond futures were firmer on safe haven inflows and as investors geared up for a second rate cut in as many months from the RBA early next week.    * Three-year bond futures rose 0.07 points to 95.045, while the 10-year bond contract added 0.045 points to 94.69.
