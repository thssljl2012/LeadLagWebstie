SYDNEY, Oct 8 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar hovered close to four-year lows against the U.S. currency on Wednesday, hurt by expectations of more interest rate cuts amid mounting fears of a sharp slowdown in the global economy.    * The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on Tuesday stunned markets by lowering the cash rate by 100 basis points, double market expectations, and left the door open for more cuts as the deepening credit crisis threatened economic activity.    * Australian bill futures are pricing in chances of more rate cuts by year end, further narrowing Australia&amp;#039;s yield advantage over the United States.    * The spread between the two-year U.S. and Australian government bond yields eased to 280 basis points on Wednesday from 335 points at the start of the week, eroding some of the Aussie&amp;#039;s high-yield appeal.    * By 9:45 a.m. (2245 GMT), the Aussie eased to $0.7120 from $0.7216 late here on Tuesday.    * The Aussie slumped to a four-year low of $0.6970 earlier this week, when it was hammered on fears that a global recession would hurt the nation&amp;#039;s commodity exports and speculation the central bank would cut rates aggressively to cushion the economy.    * Worries about a global slowdown weighed down on stock markets and benefited the safe-haven yen. The Aussie fell to 72.30 yen from 74.22 yen late here on Tuesday, not far from a five-year low of 70.27 yen struck earlier this week.    * The housing finance report for August is out at 11:30 a.m. (0030 GMT), with activity expected to have remained sluggish. Analysts forecast the amount lent to decline by 1.2 percent from the previous month.    * Australian bond futures were firmer, extending gains made the previous day. The yield curve continued to steepen as the short-end outperformed, buoyed by speculation of more rate cuts in the near term.    * Three-year Australian bond futures rose 0.07 points to 95.485, while the 10-year bond contract added 0.02 points to 94.945.
