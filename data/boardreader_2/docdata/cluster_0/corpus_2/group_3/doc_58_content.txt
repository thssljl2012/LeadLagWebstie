 Plummeting oil price suggests worse is to come           * Yuji Okada and Angela Macdonald-Smith       * October 28, 2008     CRUDE oil prices fell for a second day in New York yesterday amid concerns that OPEC&amp;#039;s production cut may fail to arrest a slump in prices as the global financial crisis threatens to reduce energy demand.    The 13 members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed on Friday to lower supply by 1.5 million barrels a day starting in November.    The group is likely to reduce production further if the latest cut does not stabilise prices, Agence France-Presse reported, citing an interview Iran&amp;#039;s OPEC representative Mohammad Ali Khatibi gave on state television.    &amp;amp;quot;I expect prices are not likely to stop falling,&amp;amp;quot; said Go Endo, a commodity strategist at Fuji Futures in Tokyo.    &amp;amp;quot;OPEC may not wait until the next meeting in December. They will probably hold an extraordinary meeting to cut production further.&amp;amp;quot;    Crude oil for December delivery fell 15 cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $US64 a barrel in after-hours electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday afternoon. The contract earlier traded as high as $US64.96.    On Friday, the front-month contract fell $US3.69, or 5.4 per cent, to $US64.15, the lowest close since May 31 last year. Futures are down 31 per cent from a year ago. The front-month contract dropped 11 per cent last week, the fourth straight weekly decline.    OPEC, the International Energy Agency and the US Energy Department all cut their forecasts for growth earlier this month.    &amp;amp;quot;There have been fairly dramatic adjustments to consumption,&amp;amp;quot; said David Moore, a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank.    Prices have dropped 56 per cent from the record $US147.27 a barrel reached on July 11 as sharemarkets declined.    Oil options contracts to sell crude at $US50 by December almost tripled on Friday after OPEC&amp;#039;s decision to slash production failed to allay concerns that the global economic slump is hurting demand.    The MSCI World Index lost more than a quarter of its value this month. This comes as subprime-related credit losses topped $US680 billion and global economic growth slowed. The S&amp;amp;amp;P 500&amp;#039;s 40 per cent loss this year would be the biggest since 1931, as the worst global financial crisis since the Depression deepens.
