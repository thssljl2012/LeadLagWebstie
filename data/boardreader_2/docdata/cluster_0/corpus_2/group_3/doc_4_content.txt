Oil closes below $90 a barrel      NEW YORK (AP) -- Oil prices plunged below $90 a barrel Monday as a  widening financial maelstrom spreads and crimps global demand for  energy.      A barrel of oil has not been this cheap in eight months, suggesting  that the climate in which oil soared to unheard of levels is coming  to an abrupt end.      Crude&amp;#039;s stunning fall comes just three months after prices surged  close to $150 a barrel. Investors, it appears, have little faith  that the $700 billion U.S. rescue plan will provide a quick fix for  the stumbling U.S. economy.      Light, sweet crude for November delivery fell $6.07, or 6.4  percent, to settle at $87.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile  Exchange. It was crude&amp;#039;s fourth straight negative session and its  lowest settlement since February 6.      Oil prices have tumbled 40 percent since peaking at $147.27 a  barrel on July 11. A drop below $85 a barrel -- an almost certainty  in the current environment -- would leave prices where they were in  late October, wiping out all of the past year&amp;#039;s massive gains.      World stock markets plunged Monday amid growing investor anxiety  that the U.S. debt crisis is enveloping Europe. Germany announced a  bailout package Sunday totaling $69 billion for Hypo Real Estate,  the country&amp;#039;s second-biggest commercial property lender. Ireland,  Iceland, Denmark and Greece moved quickly to guarantee bank  deposits to ease consumer anxiety.      The Dow Jones industrial average fell below 10,000 for the first  time in four years, losing as much as 800 points.      &amp;quot;The market is finally acknowledging that this credit crisis is a  global phenomenon and that will equate to lower world oil demand in  the future,&amp;quot; said Phil Flynn, analyst at Alaron Trading Corp. in  Chicago. &amp;quot;People thought the crisis would be contained to the U.S.  and we&amp;#039;d see oil demand in China and India continue to grow. Now  that just doesn&amp;#039;t seem possible.&amp;quot;      The widening scope of the crisis has forced consumers and  businesses everywhere to cut back on fuel consumption. In India,  domestic oil product sales totaled 2.41 million barrels per day in  August, the lowest level this year, while Japan&amp;#039;s oil demand fell  by 8.4 percent in the same month, according to Barclays Capital  research. In the same month.      In the U.S., the drop in crude prices continued to drag down pump  prices. A gallon of regular shed 2 cents to a new national average  of $3.504, according to auto club AAA, the Oil Price Information  Service and Wright Express.      In other signs the meltdown is spreading, Belgian Prime Minister  Yves Leterme said Sunday that France&amp;#039;s BNP Paribas SA had committed  to taking a 75 percent stake in Fortis NV.      British treasury chief Alistair Darling said he was ready to take  &amp;quot;pretty big steps that we wouldn&amp;#039;t take in ordinary times&amp;quot; to help  the country weather the credit crunch.      Oil market traders are now watching to see if oil prices will sink  to the next key technical level of $85 a barrel, the price for a  barrel of crude when it began its historic run-up late last  year.      &amp;quot;If we take out that area, we could see a major washout of this  market,&amp;quot; Flynn said. &amp;quot;We could be talking $50 or $60 oil.&amp;quot;      If that happens, analysts say the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries may to cut production and keep prices from  falling further.      Iranian Oil Minister Gholam Hossien Nozari on Saturday called on  fellow OPEC members not to pump too much oil.      Traders were also watching currency movements as investors tend to  buy commodities like oil to defend against dollar weakness and a  hedge against inflation, but sell crude as the U.S. currency  strengthens.      &amp;quot;With Europe starting to be in panic mode, the dollar is gaining by  default of the euro weakening and this continues to be a negative  factor for commodities,&amp;quot; said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix in  Switzerland.       http://www.cnn.com/2008/BUSINESS/10/06/oil.prices.ap/index.html?eref=rss_latest
