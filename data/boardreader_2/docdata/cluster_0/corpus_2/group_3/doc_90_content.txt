SYDNEY, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar slipped from offshore highs on Friday, dented by another sharp drop in commodities prices on concerns a global economic downturn would hurt demand for natural resources.    * Australia is a big exporter of commodities and a global recession will pose a significant downside risk to the economy.    * Although stock markets on Wall Street surged late in the session, investor confidence remained fragile after U.S. banks reported huge losses and industrial output in September posted its biggest drop since 1974.    * Also weighing down on the Aussie were expectations of another big rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The federal government announced a stimulus package earlier this week, but investors are still expecting a 50 basis point cut by the central bank to cushion households from the credit crunch.    * By 9:20 a.m. (2220 GMT), the Aussie was at $0.6847 against the U.S. dollar, up from $0.6691 late here on Thursday, but off a high of $0.6943, hit offshore. It struck a 5- year low of $0.6330 struck late last week.    * Against the yen, the Aussie eased to 69.36 yen from an offshore high of 70.55 yen, with investors cautious about riskier assets and leveraged carry trades.    * Domestic export and import price data for the third quarter is out at 11:30 a.m. (0030 GMT). The report is first in the series of data in the lead up to the third-quarter consumer price index on Oct. 22.    * Australian bond futures fell as cash switched from safe-haven government debt back into riskier stock markets. Three-year Australian bond futures fell 0.085 points to 95.41, while the 10-year bond contract shed 0.08 points to 94.65.
