Australia is a big exporter of resources and the export price data showed that a booming terms of trade was underpinning the economy.    * Shortly after midday, the Aussie was at $0.6915 against the U.S. dollar, up from $0.6691 late here on Thursday, with short covering by traders also helping. It struck a 5- year low of $0.6330 late last week.    * The Aussie recovered ground to 70.27 yen, with investors cautiously returning to leveraged carry trades.    * But the Aussie was unlikely to rise much amid expectations of another big rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The government announced a stimulus package earlier this week, but investors are still expecting a 50 basis point cut by the central bank to cushion households from the credit crunch.    * Australian bond futures fell as cash moved out of safe-haven government debt to riskier stock markets. Three-year Australian bond futures fell 0.055 points to 95.44, while the 10-year bond contract shed 0.085 points to 94.645.
