SINGAPORE, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The Korean won, Indonesian rupiah and Philippine peso recovered from their lows on Thursday after the previous day&amp;#039;s coordinated rate cuts by major central banks spurred a somewhat delayed rally in the euro and other high-yielders.    &amp;#039;Everything&amp;#039;s recovering. Euro is up, dollar/yen is up, high-yielders are up,&amp;#039; said a trader in Kuala Lumpur.    Traders suspected heavy intervention from the Bank of Korea, following a rate cut earlier in the day, helped the won rally from 10-1/2-year lows near 1,485 per dollar to levels 8 percent higher.    But as the euro and Aussie rallied alongside a recovery in stock markets, Asian non-deliverable forward markets too pared their bearishness on the local units.    One-month rupiah NDFs dropped to 9,910 per dollar from the day&amp;#039;s high of 10,100, which implied a nearly 5 percent depreciation in the currency, as spot moved to 9,590 from 9,625.    The Singapore dollar was steady around 1.4685 per dollar as traders awaited the central bank&amp;#039;s semi-annual monetary review on Friday, when most analysts expect the current gradual tightening policy stance to be eased.    The ringgit came off a 13-month low of 3.5080 per dollar, while the peso clawed back half a percent from a low of 47.80.    Still, dollar funding costs stayed high in Asia despite the deep and joint rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and central banks in China and Europe, hitting levels as high as 7 percent for overnight funds.    Analysts also remained cautious on the medium term outlook for risky assets, with little sign yet that the global credit crisis had stopped claiming more victims and markets. &amp;#039;Dollar/Asia will continue to move higher,&amp;#039; said Peter Redward, head of Asian strategy at Barclays Bank.    The unwinding of positions and deteriorating current account balances in Asia will keep extending downward pressure on the currencies, he said.    &amp;#039;Higher risk assets will continue to be sold down, so buy the dollar,&amp;#039; Redward said.
