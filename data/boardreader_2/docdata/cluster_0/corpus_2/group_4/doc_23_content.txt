       Giant Mines Scramble to Cut Output  &amp;amp;quot;Mining companies -- which couldn&amp;#039;t dig minerals out of the earth fast enough just a few months ago -- now are struggling to climb out of a very deep hole.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;amp;quot;Metals prices fell 35% in just four weeks last month -- the steepest decline ever recorded, according to Barclays Capital. Prices for palladium, a key ingredient in automobile catalytic converters, are down 70% since midyear as car buyers make themselves scarce. Half or more of the world&amp;#039;s aluminum production is now unprofitable.&amp;amp;quot;  &amp;amp;quot;Nearly every mineral is affected. Molybendum, which gives steel its strength, fell 60% to $12 a pound in the past year. Copper -- recently so expensive that burglars would break into houses not to steal jewelry, but to steal the plumbing -- is off more than 50% since April. Tin smelters across Indonesia, where nearly 25% of the world&amp;#039;s tin is made, are halting production.&amp;amp;quot;   http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122688301012632105.html?mod=testMod
