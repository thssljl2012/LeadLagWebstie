Regional stock markets were higher, taking    their cue from Wall Street, where shares rallied on the U.S.    government&amp;#039;s move to bailout struggling banking giant Citigroup .    * Shortly after midday, the Aussie had slipped to    $0.6469 from a session high $0.6556, which was its best level    since Nov. 19.    * The Aussie dollar had fallen to a one-month low last    Friday, prompting the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to step in    to buy the currency.    * The Aussie also eased against the yen, dropping    to 62.53 yen from a one-week high of 63.70 yen struck earlier in    the session. Yet is was up more than 5 yen from a one-month low    of 56.93 yen struck on Friday.    * Gold prices fell from six-week highs after the U.S.    dollar edged up and investors booked profits. Australia is a big    exporter of natural resources and investors have been unwinding    positions on expectations a global recession will hurt demand for    commodities.    * Australian bonds rose from lows, but were still in the red    as safe-haven inflows eased after stock markets rallied.    Three-year bond futures were down 0.065 points to 96.40,    recovering from a low of 96.35, while the 10-year contract  shed 0.075 points to 95.32.    * Bill futures were lower, but investors are still    betting the RBA would have to cut rates even more aggressively. A    full percentage point is now expected in December, if not sooner.
