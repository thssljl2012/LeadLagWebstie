This was the largest amount ever bought in a single    month and the first net purchase since 2001.    ___________________________________  ____________________________    * The Australian dollar remained under pressure on Thursday    as weakness in stocks kept investors risk-averse, though it found    some support from data showing the central bank bought a record    amount of the currency last month.    * The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) intervened in late    October to buy the currency as it collapsed to 60 cents amid    global market turmoil. It has since intervened again around    $0.6350.    * Analysts said the extent of the intervention showed its    commitment to keeping any fall orderly and might make bears wary    of shorting the currency too far, too fast.    * The Aussie was hovering around $0.6394, having found    support at $0.6360. It had been as high as $0.6597    offshore before U.S. equities sank. The S&amp;amp;amp;P ended down 6    percent on fears of a deep recession    * Aussie also down at 61.25 yen, and away from a    63.86 peak in New York. Renewed flight to the perceived safety of    the Japanese yen has lifted it across the board.    * Destruction of equity wealth and more dire U.S. data  reinforced expectations of more aggressive rate cuts    from the RBA, boosting bill futures.    * RBA Governor Glenn Stevens late Wednesday said Australia    had ample scope to move to an expansionary policy,    both through interest rates and fiscal spending.    * The market is already pricing in a rate cut of at least 75    basis points in the 5.25 percent cash rate at its December    meeting, and further drastic easing to 3.5 percent next year.    * Three-year bond futures climbed 0.055 points to    96.310, having earlier touched a record high of 96.350, while the    10-year contract added 0.06 to 95.215.    * Treasuries were even stronger as U.S. consumer prices fell    a steep 1 percent in October and the Fed signalled a    willingness to ease again.    * Two-year Treasury yields fell to their lowest since 1976    while the spread between Australian and U.S. 10-year yields    widened out to 146 basis points.
