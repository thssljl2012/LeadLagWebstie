SYDNEY, Nov 11 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar was subdued    on Tuesday as risk appetite waned after the euphoria generated by    a huge Chinese stimulus package faded and pessimism about the    global economic outlook returned to dog investors.    * Wall Street stocks fell as worries about the future of    companies like General Motors mounted. GM&amp;#039;s shares fell to    a 62-year low after Deutsche Bank lowered its equity value on the    automaker to zero and a number of brokerages warned the company    was fast running out of cash.    * That prompted a move towards safe-haven assets. The    low-yielding yen regained strength and government bonds rallied.    The Aussie fell to 65.64 yen from 67.93 yen as demand    for leveraged carry trades took a hit.    * By 9:35 a.m., the Aussie was at $ 0.6722 against the    U.S. dollar, down from $0.6866 late here on Monday. It rose as    high as $0.6985 on Monday, not far from a peak of $0.7015 struck    on Nov. 4.    * Fresh evidence that the euro zone was probably slipping    into a recession also dampened appetite for higher-yielding    currencies and riskier assets like stocks.    * The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on Monday cut its    economic growth forecasts and said it would review interest rates    in the months ahead with the aim of preventing a sharper downturn    as the credit turmoil takes its toll.    * A private sector survey on business confidence and    conditions for October is likely to provide further evidence    about slowing demand in the economy.    * Australian bond futures rallied on safe-haven inflows while    December bill futures rose on expectations of aggressive    interest rate cuts next month.    * The central bank cut its cash rate by a larger than    expected 75 basis points to 5.25 percent last week, after a 100    basis point cut in October. Markets are pricing in a 75 basis    point cut next month with some even hoping for a cut before the    December 2 meeting.    * Three-year bond futures were 0.155 points higher at 95.96 , while the 10-year futures contract added 0.165    points to 94.97.
