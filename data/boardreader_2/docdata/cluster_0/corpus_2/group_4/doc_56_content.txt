SYDNEY, Nov 3 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar held above 67    U.S. cents on Monday, but gains were likely to be checked by    worries about a sharp global economic downturn and an aggressive    local interest rate cut.    * The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is expected to cut its    benchmark rate by 50 basis points when its policy board holds its    monthly rate-setting meeting on Tuesday, following a cut of 100    basis points to 6 percent in October.    * Domestic data on Monday will point to a sluggish economy. A    private sector jobs survey for October is due while the    government&amp;#039;s monthly retail sales report and third-quarter house    price index numbers will be released at 11:30 a.m. (0030 GMT).    * By 10:20 a.m. (2320 GMT) the Aussie had risen to    $0.6726 against the U.S. dollar, little changed from $0.6729 late    here on Friday. It has gained over 10 percent since a 5-   year    low of $0.6007 last last month.    * The Aussie lost 15 percent last month as investors unwound    carry trades and dumped currencies of commodity producing    countries on expectations that a global recession would hurt    demand for natural resources. Australia is a big exporter of    commodities.    * The Aussie slipped to 66.06 yen from 66.26 yen    late here on Friday, with risk aversion still dominant despite a    rebound in Wall Street stocks.    * Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on    Friday showed currency speculators increased their short    positions in the Australian dollar. Net short positions increased    to 9,819 contacts in the week to Oct. 28 from 7,234 a week    earlier.    * Australian bill futures were firm, with investors    eyeing more rate cuts after Tuesday&amp;#039;s expected reduction.    * Australian bond futures were lower, as safe-haven inflows    eased. The three-year bond futures fell 0.055 points to    95.455, while the 10-year futures contract shed 0.125    points to 94.695.
