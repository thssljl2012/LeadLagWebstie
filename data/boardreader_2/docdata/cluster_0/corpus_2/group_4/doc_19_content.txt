That   this autumns relatively cheap oil is likely a flash in the panand that triple-digit oil will soon be a permanent fixture again.           &amp;amp;nbsp;    Still out there (AP)          The   Paris-based IEA, energy adviser to rich countries,       is warning       that crude oil will average $100 a barrel between 2008 and 2015 because of a looming supply crunch.   Thats a more pessimistic take than the oil market itself, which prices    forward oil futures contracts    in the $80s (for 2010 and 2011) and around $90 (for 2012 and 2013).       The biggest cause of that coming crunch, the IEA says, is under-investment in new and existing fields   in order to make sure oil production keeps pace with production declines and growing global demand.    Sure, todays cheap oil threatens to    stunt    some    investment   . In fact, the investment retrenchment going on today as cheaper oil prices make marginal oil projects less attractive is surprising in itself: The speed with which the supply side has screamed in pain this time is dramatically faster than in previous price cycles,    Barclays Bank says   .     But thats just the half of it.   An investment slowdown just aggravates an already bad situation  .    To wit:   Even steady investment in new upstream oil projects outside of OPEC would be hard-pressed to keep the world awash in oil,   the bank says. Unlike previous production slumpslike in the early 1990s, when Russia was quaveringseveral countries are simultaneously facing Sisyphean tasks to keep oil production from floundering, including the U.K.,   Mexico, and even Brazil, where deep-water oil fields are proving much trickier and much more expensive than expected to exploit.        Thats the main reason oil prices spiked this year. And its the main reason oil prices will head north again   despite the slowdown, Barclays says:       Perception of a structural mismatch between incremental demand and incremental non-OEPC supplies has proved a primary factor behind the upwards shift of the oil curve in recent years.   The long-term nature of that fundamental imbalance means that its effects are set to outlast the current phase of demand weakness   [] Having oil under the ground does not automatically imply that it is going to flow above ground and the ongoing shift in the location, composition and geography of the worlds resource base has made that link even less precise.         In other words, peak oilers, you may be back in business. For the       rest of you      , business as usual may be a thing of the past.
