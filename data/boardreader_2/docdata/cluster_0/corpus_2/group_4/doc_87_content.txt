SYDNEY, Nov 20 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar came under    pressure on Thursday while bond futures hit record peaks as a    slide in U.S. stocks to five-year lows sent investors fleeing to    the safety of the Japanese yen and U.S. Treasuries.    * Aussie testing major support around $0.6350, having    been as high as $0.6597 offshore before U.S. equities sank. The    S&amp;amp;amp;P ended down 6 percent on fears of a deep recession    * Dealers wary of intervention from the Reserve Bank of    Australia (RBA) given they have bought around $0.6350 previously,    though it has said it is not defending any particular level.    * The monthly RBA bulletin at 11:30 a.m. (0030 GMT) may offer    a clue on how much A$ the central bank bought in October.    * Aussie also slides to 60.95 yen, and away from a    63.86 peak in New York. Renewed flight to the perceived safety of    the Japanese yen has lifted it across the board.    * Destruction of equity wealth and more dire U.S. data  reinforced expectations of more aggressive rates    cuts from the RBA, boosting bill futures.    * RBA Governor Glenn Stevens late Wednesday said Australia    had ample scope to move to an expansionary policy,    both through interest rates and fiscal spending.    * The market is already pricing in a rate cut of at least 75    basis points in the 5.25 percent cash rate at its December    meeting, and further drastic easing to 3.5 percent next year.    * Three-year bond futures climbed 0.085 points to a    fresh record high of 96.340, while the 10-year contract    added 0.05 to 95.205.    * Treasuries were even stronger as U.S. consumer prices fell    a steep 1 percent in October and the Fed signalled a    willingness to ease again.    * Two-year Treasury yields fell to their lowest since 1976    while the spread between Australian and U.S. 10-year yields    widened out to 146 basis points.    * Commodities were mostly softer. Oil lost $1.14 to    $53.25, while the CRB index shed 0.74 percent to 240.56.
