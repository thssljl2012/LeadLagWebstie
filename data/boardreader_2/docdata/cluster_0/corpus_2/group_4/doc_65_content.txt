Estimates ranged    from a deficit of A$500 million to a surplus of A$1.1 billion.    NEWS: Australia slashed economic growth and budget surplus    forecasts due to the global financial crisis. The mid-year review    of budget forecasts said economic growth would slow to 2.0    percent in the year to end-June 2009 while the budget surplus for    the year to end-June 2009 was now projected to be just A$5.4    billion ($3.8 billion) in 2008/09..    ___________________________________  _____________________________    * The Australian dollar slipped from two-week highs after the    government&amp;#039;s move to slash its growth and budget surplus    forecasts added to a bout of profit taking. It had risen to a    2-week peak of $0.7015 in offshore trade.    * Still, the Aussie remained well supported as global risk    aversion eased and investors unwound some safe-haven investments    on expectations that steep interest rate cuts by global central    banks would cushion the world economy from a major downturn.    * Firmer commodities also buoyed the Aussie. Shanghai copper    futures gained more than 3 percent, having risen more than 6    percent in London on Tuesday.    * Shortly after midday, the Aussie was at $0.6952, up    from $0.6638 late here on Tuesday when it fell after the RBA&amp;#039;s    bigger-than-expected rate cut.    * The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut the cash rate by 75    basis points to 5.25 percent, more than expectations of a 50    basis point cut. The Bank of England and the European Central    Bank are also expected to lower rates on Thursday as they try to    cushion their economies from the threat of a looming recession.    * The Aussie rose to 69.32 yen from 65.52 yen late    here on Tuesday, but off a two-week high of 70.51 yen struck    offshore as some wariness crept in ahead of the U.S. presidential    election result. Stock markets are factoring in a win for    Democrat Barack Obama.    * Australian bond futures were lower as safe-haven inflows    took a breather. But bill futures for December extended    gains as investors priced in chances of more aggressive rate cuts    by the year-end from the RBA.    * Three-year bond futures shed 0.01 points to 95.685, while    the 10-year futures contract fell 0.07 points to 94.66.
