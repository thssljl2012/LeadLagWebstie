       Oil rises on surprising industrial output figures         By PABLO GORONDI, Associated Press Writer Pablo Gorondi, Associated Press Writer  31 mins ago AFP/File    Oil prices rebounded Monday on a government report showing a surprise jump in U.S. industrial output.  Crude prices have been falling with almost every economic report suggesting a broad and extended slowdown for big industrial companies and consumers alike.  Light, sweet crude for January rose $1.62, nearly 3 percent, to $59.22 on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the report was released.  In London, January Brent crude rose $1.15 to $55.39 on the ICE Futures exchange.  The Federal Reserve said Monday that industrial output rose 1.3 percent last month, reflecting a return to more normal operations following hurricanes and a strike at aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. the previous month.  Those disruptions along with the weak economy caused industrial production to fall by 3.7 percent in September, the biggest one-month drop since a 5 percent plunge in February 1946.  Dour economic news, however, continued to arrive elsewhere.  Japan, the world&amp;#039;s second-largest economy, said Monday it slid into a recession for the first time since 2001 after gross domestic product contracted at an annual pace of 0.4 percent in the third quarter. It shrank 3.7 percent in the second quarter. Japan now joins the 15-nation euro-zone in a recession, defined as two straight quarters of GDP contraction.  &amp;amp;quot;Markets are very worried about the international economic outlook, about oil consumption,&amp;amp;quot; said David Moore, a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. &amp;amp;quot;As data is released in the U.S., Europe and other countries, investors get a reminder of the economic problems in the developed world.&amp;amp;quot;  Lowe&amp;#039;s said its third-quarter profit fell 24 percent as consumers postponed home-improvement projects and big-ticket purchases as an all-but-certain recession looms. Discount retailer Target Corp. said Monday that a difficult retail environment and weak results from its credit-card segment led to a 24 percent decline in third-quarter earnings.  Oil prices have tumbled more than 60 percent since peaking near $150 a barrel in mid-July.  OPEC President Chakib Khelil on Sunday downplayed the possibility that the group could cut production at a meeting this month.  On Saturday, Iran called on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to reduce output quotas by up to 1.5 million barrels a day a meeting later this month. But Khelil said OPEC, which accounts for about 40 percent of world crude supply, hasn&amp;#039;t yet fully enforced previous quotas and the group needs more data before it decides to cut production.  Iran&amp;#039;s call for more cuts is a &amp;amp;quot;wish,&amp;amp;quot; Khelil said. OPEC, which cut quotas by 1.5 million barrels a day last month, plans to meet for an emergency session on Nov. 29 in Cairo, Egypt, and will meet again in Oran, Algeria, on Dec. 17.  &amp;amp;quot;The short-term trend for oil prices is possibly still to the downside,&amp;amp;quot; Moore said. &amp;amp;quot;But as the OPEC cuts start to take surplus out of the market, this tightening will eventually give support to the oil price.&amp;amp;quot;  Oil prices were down despite a weaker U.S. dollar as investors seemed more affected by falling global stock markets.  By midday in Europe, the FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was down 1.3 percent, Germany&amp;#039;s DAX was lower by 1.5 percent and the CAC-40 in France was off 1.6 percent.  Investors often buy oil futures as a hedge against inflation and a weaker dollar and sell when the dollar gains.   The euro rose to $1.2672 Monday from $1.2602 on Friday while the dollar fell against the Japanese yen to 96.38 yen from 97.57 yen on Friday.   In other Nymex trading, gasoline futures rose 3.42 cents to $1.273 a gallon. Heating oil rose 4.59 cents to $1.8777 a gallon while natural gas for December delivery rose 18 cents to fetch $6.49 per 1,000 cubic feet.   http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/oil_prices;_ylt=Aqs2Tw_AxFsZn_biaz1FNOWRP5Z4
