 HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Asian markets were split on either side of breakeven Tuesday, with Japanese stocks pacing gains as exporters such as Toyota Motor Co. were spurred by the yen&amp;#039;s weakness, while Australian shares cut losses after the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage point to 5.25%.  .....  The Nikkei 225 Average jumped 6.3% to end at 9,114.60, as trading resumed for the first time since Friday, when the benchmark tumbled 5%. The broader Topix index gained 5% to 910.70.  The S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200, which fell more than 2% earlier in the day, ended the day 0.2% lower at 4,215.10 in Sydney. The index narrowed losses as financials such as Westpac Banking Corp. and Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group rebounded after the Reserve Bank of Australia&amp;#039;s sharper-than-expected interest rate cut. Economists widely expected a half-point cut.   ....  In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index reversed declines to end 0.3% higher at 14,384.34.    http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/sydney-retreats-t...
