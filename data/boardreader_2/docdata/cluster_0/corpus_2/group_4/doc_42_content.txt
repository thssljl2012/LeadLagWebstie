Oil Rises Above $55, Global Economy Fears RemainReuters   18 Nov 2008   08:45 AM ET Text Size Oil rose above $55 a barrel on Tuesday, after setting a new near 22-month low as the gloomy outlook for the world economy helped extinguish a brief rally. U.S. light, sweet crude [US@CL.1 55.1 0.15 (+0.27%)] oil for December delivery was lower. It touched a new 22-month low of $54.13, its lowest since January 2007. London Brent crude [GB@IB.1 52.33 0.02 (+0.04%)] also fell. &amp;quot;There was a short-lived rally,&amp;quot; said Christopher Bellew, of Bache Commodities, &amp;quot;But what&amp;#039;s always driving it downwards is the weak fundamentals.&amp;quot; The capture of a Saudi oil tanker by pirates off east Africa had helped spur the market&amp;#039;s brief rebound, he said. Oil has fallen more than 60 percent from its July record above $147 a barrel as the credit crisis has hit the real economy and dampened fuel demand in the United States, the world&amp;#039;s biggest energy consumer and other industrial countries.

China, the world&amp;#039;s second biggest energy consumer, became a net diesel exporter in October for the first time since August 2007, as heavy inventories and higher refinery output reduced import needs. OPEC, source of more than a third of the world&amp;#039;s oil, has so far agreed to remove around 2 million barrels per day from oil markets to try to halt the price slide.
