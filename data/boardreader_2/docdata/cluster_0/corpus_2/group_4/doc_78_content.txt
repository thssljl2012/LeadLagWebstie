SYDNEY, Nov 13 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar was sharply    lower on Thursday, having shed over two U.S. cents and four yen    as equities and commodities were hammered by global growth    worries.    * Risk aversion sent the Aussie tumbling to 60.50 yen , from 64.39 late here on Wednesday, as the Japanese    currency gained across the board on safe-haven flows.    * Aussie fell to $0.6370, from $0.6595 on Wednesday,    as investors fled to the liquidity of short-term U.S. Treasuries.    It also lost ground to the euro and Swiss franc.    * Australian bond futures benefited from the safe-haven flows    and as gloomy global news reinforced expectations the Reserve    Bank of Australia (RBA) would cut rates again aggressively in    December, if not sooner.    * The market is now almost fully pricing in a cut of 100    basis points in December taking rates to 4.25 percent, which    would be the lowest since late 2001. Further easing toward 3.5    percent is priced in for next year.    * Three-year bond futures jumped 0.165 points to    96.220, the highest in at least 16 years, while the 10-year    contract climbed 0.155 to 95.065.    * Stocks on Wall Street sank over 5 percent after Best    Buy warned of a bleak outlook and the U.S. Treasury backed away    from a plan to buy distressed mortgage assets from banks. .    * Commodities took a beating with the CRB index losing    2.63 percent to 245.44, while oil dropped around 5    percent to $55.75 a barrel.    * Australia is a major exporter of resources, so falling    prices and the risk of global recession have a big impact on the    domestic economy.    * The only domestic data on Thursday are average weekly    earnings, a series that rarely moves the market.
