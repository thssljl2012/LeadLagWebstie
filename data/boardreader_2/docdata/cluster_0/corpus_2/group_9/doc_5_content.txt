   Asian Stock Markets Awash In Sea Of Red   Tina Wang  , 04.21.09, 05:25 AM EDT Investors were pessimistic on Bank of America and IBM results out of the U.S., and China Mobile's slower-than-expected earnings.

A string of disappointing financial results from U.S. bellwethers Bank of America and IBM, as well as China's biggest wireless carrier, dissipated investors' hope of revived global demand.     Bank of America    (   BOA   -   news   -   people   ) posted $4.3 billion in first-quarter profit, but largely on earnings from its Merrill Lynch unit. Declines in its other businesses and BOA's allotment of $13.4 billion for credit losses heightened concern among investors. Brokerage house    Nomura Holdings    (   MTU   -   news   -   people   ) slid 3.7%, or 22 yen (22 cents), to 578 yen ($5.89).    HSBC    (   HBC   -   news   -   people   ) sank 5.1%, or 2.80 Hong Kong dollars (36 cents), to 52.15 Hong Kong dollars ($6.73).  Japan's Nikkei 225 shed 2.4%, or 213.42 points, to 8,711.33. The yen continued to strengthen, trading near 98.1525 against the dollar, in a blow to Japanese exporters' earnings.     Toyota Motor    (   TM   -   news   -   people   ) tumbled 3.9%, or 150 yen ($1.53), to 3,720 yen ($37.90).    Honda Motor    (   HMC   -   news   -   people   ) plummeted 4.9%, or 140 yen ($1.43), to 2,730 yen ($27.81).     Sony    (   SNE   -   news   -   people   ) slumped 4.1%, or 110 yen ($1.12), to 2,545 yen ($25.93). IBM's first-quarter sales results suggested demand wasn't coming back soon, as revenue fell a worse-than-expected 11% from a year earlier. First-quarter earnings slid 1%.  Markets fell elsewhere in Asia. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled 3.0%, or 465.02 points, to 15,285.89.  Meanwhile,    China Mobile    (   CHL   -   news   -   people   ) slid 5.1%, or 3.80 Hong Kong dollars (49 cents), to 70.50 ($9.10), after the wireless carrier on Monday posted its slowest profit growth in five years. First-quarter profit climbed a less-than-expected 5.2%, from a year earlier, to 25.2 billion yuan ($3.7 billion).  Shares of    PCCW    (   PCCWY   -   news   -   people   ) remained suspended from trading. On Monday, Hong Kong appeals court judge Anthony Rogers called tycoon Richard Li's $2 billion bid to privatize the telecom giant "outrageous," particularly taking note of Li and China Netcom's plan to pay themselves a cash dividend up to $2.4 billion from PCCW after they take it private. But Rogers is one of three judges, and the court hearing continued Tuesday.
