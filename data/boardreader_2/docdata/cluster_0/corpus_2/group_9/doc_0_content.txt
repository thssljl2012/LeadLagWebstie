    HSBC, Sony and Mitsubishi led the fallers in Asia   UK banks under pressure   Analysts believe financial crisis far from over        Asian stockmarkets fell sharply today after Bank of America pummelled hopes that the  world economy had moved closer to a recovery .    Traders in Japan and Hong Kong were keen to offload shares, sending the Nikkei index dropping by more than 200 points, or 2.3%, to 8711.33, and the Hang Seng down by almost 600 points, a fall of 3.7%, to 15,168.80. Financial stocks and key exporters suffered badly, with HSBC, Sony and Mitsubishi leading the fallers.    Analysts said the sell-off was sparked by Bank of America,  which reported yesterday that it has set aside $13.4bn (9.2bn) to cover credit losses . The prospect of a surge in unpaid credit card bills, mortgage defaulters and commercial banking losses alarmed the markets, which had hoped that the worst of the crisis was behind them.    Despite BoA reporting first quarter profits of $4.2bn, its shares tumbled 24% yesterday, dragging the Dow Jones index down by 3.5%. With the FTSE 100 falling below 4000 yesterday, analysts believe that the stockmarket rally that began in early March may be over.    "Clearly the concern over the banking sector's health affected Asia's stance towards equities," said David Buik of BGC Partners, who warned that the banking sector was still "far from out of the woods" despite BoA making a $4.2bn profit in the first quarter of 2008.    This morning the FTSE 100 was steady in early trading at 3977.85, down 13 points, having dropped 101 points yesterday. But financial stocks kept falling, with Lloyds Banking Group down 7.5% and Barclays losing 5.5%.    Buik warned that the banks could come under more pressure during 2009 as unemployment keeps rising and house prices continue to fall.    "There is every chance that this first quarter for the US banks will be the best one for 2009 and possible even 2010, and in the case of the UK banks' first half year results, will almost certainly be more upbeat than perhaps the second half of the year," he predicted. "If you bother to speak to the average person who runs a flower shop, a dry cleaner or other small businesses of that nature, trade is down by 40% and they are hanging in there."    BoA's chairman and chief executive, Ken Lewis, is also "hanging in there", in the face of shareholder efforts to split the two roles. He has been criticised for the rescue of Merrill Lynch last autumn, but denied that BoA needs more capital to survive the downturn.    Analysts also questioned quite how rosy its first-quarter results were. Jason Goldberg, a banking analyst at Barclays Capital, said that excluding one-off items, the group's performance "looks closer to break-even" than the $4.2bn profit reported.
