JOHANNESBURG, Jan 15 (Reuters) - South African markets remained on the back foot on Thursday, with stocks notching up a seventh consecutive day of losses, tracking weaker global stocks, and the rand hovering near a one-month low to the dollar.    The Johannesburg Top-40 index of blue-chip stocks ended 2.08 percent lower at 18,345.99 points, its lowest close since Dec. 8, while the All-share index dropped 1.92 percent to 20,441.93 points.    'Commodity prices and world markets ... that's what the whole market is driven by at the moment,' Tubby Goodwin, a trader at Investec Securities said.    European Shares fell and Wall Street opened more than two percent lower as banking shares dropped, knocked by concerns about funding for Bank of America and Citigroup.    Gold Fields Ltd, the world's No. 4 gold producer, was down 9.19 percent to 77.37 rand in Johannesburg and Harmony Gold dropped 2.89 percent to 92.50 rand.    Petrochemicals group Sasol lost 3.63 percent to 284 rand as the oil price fell more than 2 percent.    The rand pared gains in a volatile session late in Johannesburg as the dollar firmed against the euro after the  European Central Bank's cut its benchmark interest rate by 50  basis points to 2 percent.    The local currency was trading at 10.18 against the dollar at 1545 GMT, 0.1 percent weaker than its previous close in New York, after earlier touching 10.25, just off Wednesday's one-month low.    It had rallied to 9.9666, in line with a brief euro rally against the dollar.    'It's been pretty volatile with good (dollar) selling between 10.20 and 10.25 ... it did track the euro to some extent but it has also out-performed the euro,' a Johannesburg-based trader said.    Exporter dollar sales helped cap losses, while weak equity markets would likely keep the unit vulnerable in the short term with strong resistance at around 10 to the dollar, traders said.    BANKS FALL    South African government bonds were mostly firmer, particularly at the short-end of the curve.    Manufacturing activity, as measured by Investec's purchasing managers index, edged higher in December but stayed near November's record low, showing a sector under strain and backing the case for more domestic rate cuts.    However, a larger than usual auction for next week may point to an expected rise in the supply of paper in the market.    The yield on the benchmark 2015 bond was down 9.5 basis points at 7.695 percent compared to the close on Wedensday, when it jumped sharply, while the 2036 yield was up 2.5 basis points at 7.625 percent.    On the bourse, South African banks were weaker in line with those in Europe and the U.S. -- Deutsche Postbank lost 15.5 percent and Barclays down 3.7 percent -- although traders this may merely have been a correction after recent gains.    'I think our banks have run probably a little hard on interest rate expectations and we are just seeing some profit-taking,' Investec's Goodwin said.    South Africa's second-biggest bank by assets FirstRand  lost 7.07 percent to 14.59 rand and Absa Bank fell 2.77 percent to 107.10 rand.    Shares in MTN Group -- which announced it had formed a co-operation agreement with fixed-line firm Neotel  to build a fibre optic cable network for up to 2 billion rand -- rose 3.58 percent to 99.50 rand.
