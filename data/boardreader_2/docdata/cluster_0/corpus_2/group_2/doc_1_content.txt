TOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - The dollar stayed within sight of a 10-1/2-month high against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday, as the weakness in other major economies continued to give a relative edge to the U.S. currency. The euro and sterling were off their lows hit the previous day but dealers were still looking to close positions ahead of monetary policy decisions by both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England on Thursday.    The euro could test a seven-month low while sterling could slip below a 2-1/2-year low against the dollar if technical levels are challenged during the day.    The Australian dollar hovered near one-year low against the dollar and five-month low against the yen before Australia&amp;#039;s second-quarter gross domestic data is released at 0130 GMT.    Investors were cutting back on currencies which had risen over the past few years such as the Australian dollar and the euro against the yen, on bleak long-term outlooks for these currencies, traders said.    &amp;#039;Investors are unwinding positions in the cross/yen on the growing view that these currencies have now entered a medium- to long-term downtrend,&amp;#039; said Hiroshi Yoshida, a trader at Shinkin Central Bank.    Recent moves in stock markets -- rising early but giving up gains later -- suggest they were also entering a medium- to long-term downtrend in line with a weaker global economy, spurring risk aversion among investors, he said.    &amp;#039;There are downside risks to the cross/yen and players are looking to sell on their rebounds,&amp;#039; said Motonari Ogawa, director of forex trading at Barclays Bank in Tokyo.    The market will be driven by cross/yen moves while oil prices were also key, he added.    The dollar index  was up 0.1 percent at 78.101, near a 10-1/2-month high of 78.310 hit on Tuesday. The index has gained about 9 percent since mid-July.    The Australian dollar was down 0.3 percent against the yen at 90.62 yen , not far from a five-month low of 89.80 yen. The Aussie was also down 0.3 percent against the dollar at $0.8339 , also not far from a 1-year low of $0.8270 hit on Tuesday.    Economists surveyed by Reuters expect second-quarter Australian gross domestic product growth to slow to 0.4 percent quarter-on-quarter from 0.6 percent in the first quarter.    The euro was down 0.1 percent to 157.62 yen , falling as low as 157.12 yen, not far from a five-month low of 157.00 yen hit on Tuesday.    The euro eased 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.4502  after falling to a seven-month low of $1.4466 on Tuesday, while sterling was also down 0.1 percent at $1.7815 , off a 2-1/2-year low of $1.7778 hit on Tuesday.    The dollar gained on Tuesday as crude oil tumbled to as low as $105.46 per barrel  as Hurricane Gustav had limited impact on energy infrastructure.
