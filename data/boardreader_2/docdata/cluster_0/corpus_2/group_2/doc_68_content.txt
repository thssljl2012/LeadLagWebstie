 CWEI Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 2              Hong Kong market reversal   The HSI went from -1354 to -4.      Hong Kong Reverses Decline  A WALL STREET JOURNAL ONLINE NEWS ROUNDUP  Article  Comments  MORE IN WORLD MARKETS     Hong Kong shares reversed a more than 7% decline to end flat after a coordinated effort by central banks to pump liquidity into global money markets.    Tokyo&amp;#039;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average slipped 2.2% to close at 11489.30, the index&amp;#039;s lowest point since June 2005. The Nikkei has so far lost 5.9% this week.    The declines in Asia came after the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 4.1% to its lowest close in almost three years, down 7.1% so far this week, after the government&amp;#039;s bailout of insurer American International Group failed to restore investors&amp;#039; confidence in banking stocks following the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings. U.S. financials were hard hit: Washington Mutual fell 13%, Citigroup 11%, Wachovia 21%, Morgan Stanley 24% and Goldman Sachs 14%.    &amp;quot;As the credit crunch continues to spread, institutional investors are trying to dump shares as Hong Kong has good liquidity,&amp;quot; said Castor Pang, a strategist at Sun Hung Kai Financial.    Among major banks in Japan, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group lost 6.6% and Mizuho Financial Group fell 4.3%. Brokerage shares were also weak. Daiwa Securities Group skidded 7.1% while Nomura Holdings dropped 6.4%.    Sony sank 8.7% on selling partly due to a rating cut by Goldman Sachs to &amp;quot;neutral&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;buy.&amp;quot;    Elsewhere, Australia&amp;#039;s S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 slumped 2.4% to end at 4607.30, while South Korea&amp;#039;s Kospi slid 2.3% to finish at 1392.42, surrendering gains from the previous session. New Zealand&amp;#039;s NZX 50 index fell 3.4% to 3158.92.    &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s very much &amp;#039;follow-the-leader&amp;#039; rule being in effect right now,&amp;quot; said Howard Gorges, vice chairman at South China Brokerages in Hong Kong. &amp;quot;There is too much uncertainty still, but there is quite a good chance that we are close to the bottom. Once people feel that the worst problems have been dealt with and that the coming problems are relatively minor,&amp;quot; the markets were likely to stabilize, Mr. Gorges said. &amp;quot;We aren&amp;#039;t there yet,&amp;quot; he added.    However, several markets did come off their lows for the day with China shares making a good intraday recovery. Traders said markets there were factoring in a possible bounce on Wall Street later, though for now U.S. stock futures were only a little higher in screen trade.    The mainland&amp;#039;s Shanghai Composite Index had a wild day, falling 0.8% after being down more than 6% at one point, though concerns persisted about the outlook for both the domestic and global economy. Bargain-hunting and short-selling helped pare losses late in the session.    The rebound in Shanghai helped Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng Index initially fell 7.7%; recently, it was down 0.8%. Earlier, the index fell below the 16500-point level for the first time in two years.    Shares of Citic group companies fell in Shanghai and Hong Kong after CNBC reported that the Chinese group was in talks with Morgan Stanley for a possible deal. Shares of China Citic Bank Corp. lost 5.5% in Hong Kong and rose 6.7% in Shanghai on bargain-hunting in oversold banks. However, a person close to Citic said there was &amp;quot;no truth&amp;quot; to the reports.    Concerns that credit markets could dry up because of the ongoing crisis in the financial sector also hurt shares of real-estate and property companies as well as steelmakers. Shares of Mitsubishi Estate lost 6.2% in Tokyo and CapitaLand shares fell 7.1% in Singapore, while Cheung Kong dropped 7.2% in Hong Kong. Among steelmakers, Nippon Steel shed 5.2% in Tokyo while shares of Posco dropped 2.8% in Seoul.    With banks increasingly gun-shy about lending to each other and funding costs rising, central banks continued to pump cash into money markets. The Bank of Japan injected another 2.5 trillion ($23.9 billion) and the Reserve Bank of Australia 803 million Australian dollars ($637.6 million).    &amp;quot;The situation remains fluid, except in interbank markets, where lending has frozen solid,&amp;quot; said analysts at DBS Bank in Singapore. &amp;quot;The fact the Libor-OIS spread is wider than ever before says something about current credit market sentiment.&amp;quot;    Asian credit default swaps were setting record-high levels with the Markit iTraxx Asia ex-Japan high-yield index quoted at 750 basis points compared to 690.20 basis points Wednesday.    Elsewhere, Singapore&amp;#039;s Straits Times Index was down 4.5% for its lowest level since July 2006, Malaysia&amp;#039;s KLCI had shed 3.9% and Philippine shares closed with a 4.3% decline to a 10-week low; Thailand was down 5.1%.    Taiwan shares were helped off their early low as the Taiwan Stabilization Fund said recent falls had met the criteria for the fund to intervene in the market, which it would do as needed.
