SINGAPORE, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Oil rose above $116 a barrel on Monday, as a quarter of U.S. crude production was shuttered because of Hurricane Gustav, while Asian stocks were stung by the technology sector, which anticipated slower global demand.    Gustav was expected to strike land west of New Orleans, on the Louisiana coast, only days after the sombre anniversary of Hurricane Katrina&amp;#039;s devastation in 2005, though the storm was not expected to strengthen significantly once it made landfall. [ID:nN31518910]    The U.S. dollar rose against major currencies, extending last month&amp;#039;s biggest rally in more than a decade, on the view the U.S. economy is likely to recover quicker than other major economies that are probably still shrinking. The dollar&amp;#039;s rally was striking since it took place with oil prices also rising, which showed the crude market&amp;#039;s singular focus on Gustav.    &amp;#039;This is definitely a dangerous storm but I think most of the market is in a wait-and-see mode,&amp;#039; said Gerard Burg, a commodities analyst at National Bank of Australia in Melbourne. &amp;#039;Investors are a lot more cautious now given the general bearish sentiments in the market.&amp;#039;    The October U.S. light crude contract climbed 83 cents in early Asian trade to $116.29 a barrel, though was only $5 from an August low. U.S. markets are closed on Monday for a holiday.    Japan&amp;#039;s Nikkei stock index  fell 1.2 percent, weighed by shares of tech companies like TDK Corp  and electronics parts maker Kyocera Corp .    Stark comments about slowing global demand for technology from the world&amp;#039;s second-largest computer maker Dell Inc , which knocked U.S. stocks lower on Friday, dealt a blow to a sector whose valuations have been among the hardest hit by the bear market.    Outside of Japan, Asia-Pacific stocks  were down 2 percent, eyeing August&amp;#039;s lows.    South Korea&amp;#039;s KOSPI  fell almost 3 percent to the lowest since March 2007, led by shares of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  and LG Corp .    Investors pulled money out of funds across the board last week, though financial sector funds attracted new money, according to EPFR Global, a Boston-based firm that tracks $10 trillion in assets.    Fund outflows from 17 of the 24 equity, sector and fixed income groups watched by EPFR totaled $7.6 billion.    All emerging market fund groups recorded outflows last week, with emerging market equity funds posting outflows for the 11th time in the last 12 weeks.    &amp;#039;Appetite for exposure to emerging markets has been eroded by a sharp correction in commodity prices during the third quarter of 2008, a string of downward revisions to economic growth forecasts and painfully high inflation rates in several key markets including Russia, India, South Africa and Argentina,&amp;#039; the firm said in a research note released over the weekend.    The dollar strengthened against both major and emerging market currencies, ahead of a busy week of central bank meetings, including the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Reserve Bank of Australia.    The euro was down 0.4 percent at about $1.4637 , on its way to testing a six-month low around $1.4570 hit last week.    The dollar was largely unchanged against the yen, at 108.42 yen .    Sterling fell 0.4 percent to $1.8050  after Britain&amp;#039;s finance minister told a newspaper the country&amp;#039;s economic downturn might turn out to be the worst in 60 years. [ID:nLU732328]    Last month, the U.S. dollar index  on the ICE Futures Exchange rose 5.4 percent, the largest monthly rise since January 1997.    Japanese government bond prices fell ahead of a 10-year benchmark auction on Tuesday. September futures tumbled 0.68 point to 137.69  after falling as low as 137.51.    Some overseas investors were also booking profits after a sharp JGB rally last month, traders said. The benchmark 10-year yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, jumped 7 basis points to 1.475 percent , up from a 4-month low of 1.400 percent hit on Friday.
