 DNDN Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 3              Wall St. Woes Push Global Stocks Lower (UBS hit hardest, down 7.2%)   By MATTHEW SALTMARSH and KEITH BRADSHER  NYT September 16, 2008      PARIS  Stocks in Europe and Asia tumbled Monday and U.S. futures and the dollar slid as the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch battered investor confidence.     In one of the most dramatic days on Wall Street in recent memory, Merrill Lynch agreed Sunday to sell itself to Bank of America for roughly $50 billion to avert a deepening financial crisis, while another prominent securities firm, Lehman Brothers, said it would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.     The humbling moves dented confidence in the markets in Europe where banks and insurers bore the brunt of fears about more write-downs in the financial sector and the possible need for government support.     Shares in UBS of Switzerland, the European bank hit hardest by mortgage-related losses, fell 7.2 percent.     Confidence has really collapsed, said Yann Azuelos, fund manager at Meeschaert, an asset manager in Paris. With the rescue of Fannie and Freddie, we thought the worst had passed. Now we know it hasnt.     He was referring to the U.S. Treasurys decision this month to take control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant mortgage lenders.    In Europe, the Dow Jones Stoxx 600 Index declined 3.4 percent to 270.81 points, while the FTSE fell 3.8 percent and the CAC-40 in Paris lost 4.1 percent. Stock markets in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and China were closed for holidays, tempering losses in Asia although other markets there declined. The benchmark Taiwan index shed 4.1 percent.     U.S. stock index futures were down sharply, suggesting that shares would drop when trading opened in New York on Monday morning.     The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, combined with the potential insolvency of the insurer American International Group threatens to saddle financial institutions around the world with new losses. Those could come if Lehmans creditors dump its toxic investments onto markets, forcing investors who own similar securities to downgrade their value, or if A.I.G.s contracts in credit default swaps, a type of insurance for securities, become worthless.     Mr. Azuelos said investors were starting to fear that not only European banks but also insurers would be caught up in the turbulence. Axa, the giant French insurer, fell 8.6 percent to 20.33 euros and Alllianz of Germany was off 5.3 percent at 104.62.     Today is the day historians will be writing about in years to come, said Andy Lynch, a fund manager at Schroder Investment Management in London. The only thing that this comes near to during my career is Russia defaulting in 1989. But that was much shorter in time and the world economy was in a healthier state.     The dollar fell against the yen to 105.69 as investors reduced so-called carry trades, where funds are borrowed in a country with low interest rates and used to buy assets where returns are higher, earning the spread between the two.     The euro pushed higher, reaching $1.448 before settling back to $1.425 in intraday trading.     Bonds prices moved higher as investors sought the safety of fixed-income markets. U.S. Treasuries surged, sending two-year notes up the most since January. The yield on two-year notes dropped 37 basis points, to 1.8 percent. The 10-year German bund yield fell 19 basis points to 3.98 percent.     To help Wall Street brace for Lehmans bankruptcy, the Federal Reserve widened the collateral it accepts for emergency loans to securities firms. A group of 10 banks that includes JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup separately formed a $70 billion fund to ensure market liquidity.     Major European central banks said on Monday that they were braced to intervene to stabilize money markets after the upheaval on Wall Street.     In Asia, the biggest financial markets were closed for a major holiday, but those indexes that were open were punished. Markets were closed on Monday in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Seoul and Shanghai.    Peter Redwood, the director of Asian currency and economic research in the Singapore office of Barclays Capital, said in the longer term, the latest difficulties in the United States are likely to hurt Asian markets.     This is an increase in risk globally, he said, adding that this was, unambiguously negative for Asia and for capital outflows from Asia.     Macquarie Group, the biggest Australian investment bank, fell 11 percent after The New York Times reported that A.I.G. was seeking a $40 billion bridge loan from the Federal Reserve. Centro Properties, the shopping mall owner facing a Sept. 30 deadline to repay some of its debt, plunged 25 percent to 7.9 Australian cents after a planned U.S. asset sale fell through.
