AIG rescue fails to calm         Yesterday&amp;#039;s $US85 billion ($107 billion) rescue of insurer AIG by the Federal Reserve failed to calm a crisis of confidence. Fears linger that Morgan Stanley - one of only two big investment banks left standing - may be next in line for a merger.         The Dow fell almost 450 points and the Nasdaq fell nearly 5 per cent in its worst day since the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001 as rattled investors worried about who could be the next victim of the global credit crisis. There were similar falls on Monday night after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.          There were also heavy losses on the London, Paris and Frankfurt markets.           Who&amp;#039;s next?          Morgan Stanley shares sank 24.2 per cent overnight to $US21.75 as investors worried whether it would survive as an independent investment bank in the current environment.         Shares of the other remaining major US investment bank, Goldman Sachs, dropped 13.9 per cent to $US114.50 and at one point fell below $100 for the first time in more than three years.         &amp;amp;quot;The fear is, &amp;#039;Who is next?&amp;#039;&amp;amp;quot; said John O&amp;#039;Brien, senior vice president at MKM Partners. &amp;amp;quot;It almost feels like people scour the books and say, &amp;#039;Who is the next likely target that we can put a short on?&amp;#039; and that spreads continuous fear.&amp;amp;quot;         Trouble spreads to Britain         The UK&amp;#039;s biggest mortgage lender, HBOS reached a merger deal with its rival Lloyds TSB, British media reported after lender&amp;#039;s shares plummeted for a third day running.         HBOS - the owner of BankWest - confirmed it was in &amp;amp;quot;advanced talks&amp;amp;quot; with Lloyds TSB, and the BBC and Sky News later reported that a deal had been struck, saying an announcement was expected early tomorrow.         Prior to the reports of the takeover talks, HBOS shares had nosedived 52 per cent to a low of 88 pence, its third successive day of heavy losses.
