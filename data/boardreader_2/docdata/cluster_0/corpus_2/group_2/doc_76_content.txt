SYDNEY, Sept 8 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar recovered from two-year lows against the yen and rebounded from one-year troughs against the U.S. dollar on Monday, after the U.S. government moved to rescue two major housing finance companies.    * The move shored up appetite for riskier assets and higher-yielding currencies. Australian bond futures tumbled as safe-haven inflows took a breather and funds sought more riskier assets like stocks and commodities.    * The U.S. government&amp;#039;s takeover of the ailing mortgage companies was prompted by worries over their shrinking capital and was the latest in a series of emergency steps taken by officials to prop up the wobbly housing sector [nN07479172].    * The Aussie leaped to 90.03 yen , from near 88.00 yen late on Friday, when it touched a two-year low of 84.98 yen. It firmed to $0.8343 U.S. cents , rising from $0.8171 late here on Friday.    * But the Aussie&amp;#039;s advance was curtailed by comments from the central bank governor who kept the door open for more cautious rate cuts in the near term [nSYD298057].    * The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) trimmed its key cash rate by 25 basis points to 7.0 percent last week, the first easing in seven years. Investors are pricing in nearly a 80 percent chance the central bank will cut rates by a quarter of a percentage point again next month.    * Three-year bond futures  slid a hefty 0.165 points 94.315, while the 10-year bond contract  shed 0.170 points to 94.23 as investors dumped safe-haven assets on the U.S. move to take over the government sponsored entities.
