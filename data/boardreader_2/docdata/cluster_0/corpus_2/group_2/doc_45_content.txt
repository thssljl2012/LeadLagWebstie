          http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/26/news/economy/gasshortage_oke...    ...As of this week, more than a dozen refineries around Texas City and Port Arthur were not operating at full capacity and, according to the Department of Energy, six refineries, with a combined capacity of 1.6 million barrels a day, were still not running at all.   A bigger problem But while the current shortages can be traced directly to the two hurricanes, the severity of the problem points out a bigger issue: The U.S. has been operating for a while with razor-thin spare gasoline capacity.   In its most recent Weekly Oil Data Review, Barclays Capital pointed out that the U.S. gasoline inventory has reached its lowest level since August 1967, when demand was a little more than half its current level of 9.3 million barrels a day. At 178.7 million barrels, inventories are 21.6 million barrels below their five-year average...   Hey, Ike could have been worse, but if this is what a Category II storm hitting in the &amp;amp;quot;right&amp;amp;quot; spot does, it appears we&amp;#039;ve missed another bullet.  If Kyle were to veer a tad to the south and slam the Mid-Atlantic in the early part of the week and take some of New Jersey refinery capacity offline we&amp;#039;ve got another real emergency brewing.  I have this real sinking feeling that 1979 will be looked at as good times in comparison to 2009.
