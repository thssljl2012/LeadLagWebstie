LONDON (MarketWatch) -- European shares traded in a tight range on  Thursday morning, with Axa leading insurance-sector advancers,  while banks lost ground in another day of uncertainty over U.S.  plans to stabilize the financial sector.      The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index rose 0.2 to 266.25, as  Axa shares climbed 2.2%.      Axa&amp;#039;s chief executive said that there are opportunities over the  next few months.      &amp;quot;The growth of our activities is still a little difficult. We have  made provisions on some of our assets but less than others. The  situation today will offer us opportunities to reinforce our  positions in the next few months,&amp;quot; said Henri de Castries.      Also in the sector, shares in re-insurer Swiss Re rose 1.7% after  it stuck to its cycle targets for earnings per share growth and  return on equity.      The company said that its investment portfolio remains sound  despite financial market challenges.      Miners also rose, with shares of Anglo American up 2.5% and shares  of Xstrata up 1.2%. Gold prices ticked higher in electronic  trading, with December futures up $4.80 at $899.80 an ounce.      Of national indexes, the French CAC-40 index rose 0.1% to 4,118.80,  the German DAX 30 index traded flat at 6,053.34 and the U.K. FTSE  100 index lost 0.3% to 5,080.85.      U.S. stocks closed mostly lower on Wednesday as indecision over the  Bush administration&amp;#039;s bank bailout plan weighed on investors. See  Wednesday&amp;#039;s U.S. Market Snapshot.      Banks declined in Europe, with shares of Lloyds TSB down 4.2% and  shares of Deutsche Bank down 1.6%.      Natixis shares dropped 8.6%. The French lender said that it reached  a take-up rate of 97% for its 3.7 billion euros rights issue. The  shares had been offered at 2.25 euros each, a 62% discount to the  lender&amp;#039;s share price when it announced the plan.      Away from financials, shares of German sportswear maker Adidas rose  1.7%.      Competitor Nike Inc. (NKE) said late Wednesday that its net income  for its fiscal first-quarter 2009 fell to $510.5 million, or $1.03  a share, from $569.7 million, or $1.12 a share, a year ago.  Earnings per share came in ahead of forecast.      &amp;quot;The order backlog growth is a positive sign for the sporting goods  industry in general and indicates that sales growth does not  necessarily fall off a cliff after the Olympic Games,&amp;quot; noted  analysts at Equinet.
