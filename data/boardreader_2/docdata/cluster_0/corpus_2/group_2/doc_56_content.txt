 CWEI Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 0              S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200, All Ords pare gains on US bailout risks                         September 26, 2008              LOCAL  shares had pared gains to be only slightly up by early afternoon on  concerns about political wrangling over the US bailout plan.     The  benchmark S&amp;amp;amp;P/ASX 200 Index was up 6.5 points, or 0.13 per cent, at  4933.9, having earlier been 1 per cent higher on the back of Wall  Street&amp;amp;#8217;s gains overnight.   The broader All Ordinaries was up 4.9 points at 4965.7.     &amp;amp;#8220;The fact that the rescue plan on Wall Street may have hit another  stumbling block has seen local investors pull out a little bit after  starting up by about 1 per cent on open,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; CommSec market analyst  Juliette Saly said.     Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve chairman Ben  Bernanke rushed back to Capitol Hill as lawmakers sought to salvage the  $US700 billion ($840 billion) rescue plan for the beleaguered US  financial sector.   The Republican rank-and-file is opposed to  the plan, despite a bipartisan group of top lawmakers earlier  announcing &amp;amp;#8220;fundamental agreement&amp;amp;#8221; over the rescue proposal.    The domestic banking sector remained firm.   Commonwealth Bank  was up 55c, or 1.25 per cent, to $44.60, National Australia Bank had  gained 34c, or 1.36 per cent, to $25.33, ANZ had risen 17c, or 0.97 per  cent, to $18.70 and Westpac had added 9c, or 0.38 per cent, to $23.95.   Macquarie Group was down 63 cents to $38.62 after announcing plans to sell its investment lending business in Australia.   Ms  Saly said Babcock &amp;amp;amp; Brown was a stand-out performer, up 25 per cent  on open. By early afternoon, it was 15c, or 6.33 per cent stronger at  $2.52.   &amp;amp;#8220;The materials sector is one of the drags on the market today, down about a third of one per cent,&amp;amp;#8221; she said.   &amp;amp;#8220;The  information technology sector is also down by about 1 per cent,  utilities are off by about half a per cent and the property trust  sector is also weaker.   &amp;amp;#8220;Consumer staples is the best sector, up by more than 2 per cent.&amp;amp;#8221;   Base metal prices were modestly higher on the London Metal Exchange overnight but nickel and gold fell slightly.   The  big diversified miners were mixed, with BHP Billiton down 4c to $36.36,  while its takeover target Rio Tinto was up 62c to $102.48.    AAP
