SYDNEY, Sept 9 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar gave up the previous day&amp;#039;s gains on Tuesday to fall towards recent one-year lows as investors steered towards the U.S. currency on the U.S. government&amp;#039;s move to rescue two ailing major mortgage giants.    * The action restored investors&amp;#039; confidence in the U.S. financial sector and boosted U.S. stocks. But demand for leveraged carry trades faltered and the Aussie eased against the yen to 88.15 yen from 90.22 yen late here on Monday when the bailout of Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac  eased some of the severe risk aversion that gripped markets recently.    * By 9:30 a.m. (2330 GMT), the Aussie had eased to $0.8162/66 from $0.8315/17 late here on Monday and not far from a one-year low of $0.8028 struck late last week.    * The Aussie has lost considerable ground since mid-July, weighed down by a softer domestic rate outlook, heightened risk aversion and lower commodities prices. Australia is a big exporter of commodities.    * Investors await Australian July retail sales and housing finance data due at 11:30 a.m. (0130 GMT). A Reuters poll forecast a monthly rise of 0.5 percent for retail sales while housing finance was expected to have been flat.    * Recent domestic data has been sluggish, prompting the central bank to cut interest rates last week for the first time in seven years. But Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Glenn Stevens suggested on Monday he was in no rush to cut interest rates further [ID:nSYD331424].    * As a result, markets have trimmed chances of a rate cut at the next central bank meeting early next month. Investors are pricing in a 75 percent chance of a 25 basis points cut in October, down from around 83 percent at the end of last week.    * Australian bond futures reversed Monday&amp;#039;s steep losses. They tailed U.S. Treasuries which rallied on mortgage-related buying of longer-dated government bonds by investors shuffling portfolios.    * Three-year bond futures  gained 0.100 points to 94.46, just a day after posting their biggest daily fall in three months, while the 10-year bond contract  added 0.135 points to 94.385.
