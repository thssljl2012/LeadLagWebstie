    Australia jobless rate surprises with 5-month low         SYDNEY, Sept 11 (Reuters) -  Australia&amp;#039;s jobless rate  fell to a five-month low in August as employers created a lot more jobs than expected even as the economy cooled, giving policy makers extra reason to be cautious in easing interest rates.      Thursday&amp;#039;s labour report showed employers hired a net 14,600 more workers in August, topping expectations of a modest 5,000 rise. Even more surprising, the jobless rate dropped 0.2 percentage point to 4.1 percent, stunning analysts who had predicted an increase to 4.4 percent.      &amp;#039;These numbers are saying to us that the unemployment situation is still quite tight in the economy,&amp;#039; said Rob Henderson, chief economist markets at nabCapital.  &amp;#039;There is yet to be any sign of a significant deterioration in the labour market,&amp;#039; he added. &amp;#039;It&amp;#039;s an ongoing reason for the Reserve Bank to be cautious.&amp;#039;      The  Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)  last week  cut its cash rate by 25 basis points to 7.0 percent , the first easing in seven years, saying the economy was slowing enough to curb inflation.  Yet the central bank has also been assuming a slowdown in employment and a rise in the jobless rate would help keep wages and inflation in check.      Earlier this week, RBA Governor Glenn Stevens said that, going by past history, the jobless rate could rise by as much as 1 percentage point in the coming 12 to 18 months.

It was this bleaker outlook that led the  central bank of New Zealand  to cut its rates by a larger-than-expected 50 basis points to 7.5 percent on Thursday (see).        SLOWDOWN STILL SEEN        &amp;#039;But if we don&amp;#039;t get weakness in employment soon, the RBA may start to re-think its game plan,&amp;#039; added Redican.      Interest rate futures still pointed to a 80 percent chance of a cut to 6.75 percent in October, though that was down from 93 percent before the jobs figures, which also won the Australian dollar a brief respite from recent heavy selling pressure.      Analysts also cautioned against reading too much into the monthly data. Due to budget cuts, the Australian Bureau of Statistics cut the labour force survey sample by 24 percent in July, making it  more volatile and less reliable . Leading indicators of the labour market, like job advertisements, were also pointing to a coming slowdown.      &amp;#039;Most of the forward looking indicators point to a much more material slowing in jobs growth toward the end of this year,&amp;#039; noted Scott Haslem, chief economist at UBS.      Yet, analysts also noted that media reports of falling unemployment could well lift consumer spirits, and so  spending . A key survey of consumers out on Wednesday had already shown a marked improvement in sentiment following last week&amp;#039;s rate cut.      And the drop in the jobless rate was in stark contrast to the situation in the  United States  where the unemployment rate rose to a five-year high of 6.1 percent in August.      &amp;#039;The jobs machine cracks on and tells you that the underlying economy still has a bit of life in it and that&amp;#039;s really the key for the consumer part of the story,&amp;#039; said Michael Blythe, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank.  &amp;#039;The recent numbers are more in line with the idea that there&amp;#039;s scope for easing the policy brakes, but you certainly don&amp;#039;t want to put your foot on the accelerator,&amp;#039; he argued.
