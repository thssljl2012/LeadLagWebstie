Sector Snap: Analyst says steel prices yet to  peak    By The Associated  Press    Last Updated: 03:01 PM EDT Jun 30, 2008          NEW YORK (AP) _ Shares of steel producers rose  Monday after an analysis of the sector concluded that  the price of the commodity has significantly further  to  climb.        Barclays Capital analyst Amrita Sen said demand for  the commodity has yet to peak  which means this  year&amp;#039;s price increases will likely be followed by  more such  gains.        &amp;amp;quot;The recent surge in steel prices can in no sense be  seen to have peaked, given the tightness in the scrap  and raw material market,&amp;amp;quot; the analyst  wrote.        Sen specifically cited infrastructure development in  both China and India as driving increased steel  demand.
