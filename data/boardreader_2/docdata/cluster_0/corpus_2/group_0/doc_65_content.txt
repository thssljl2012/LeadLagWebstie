New home sales fall        http://business.theage.com.au/new-ho...0701-2zoy.html    Chris Zappone    July 1, 2008 - 12:17PM       New homes sales fell 5% in May, a sharp drop from a 0.1% decline in April, in a sign that 12-year high interest rates are slowing residential home buying activity.      House sales dropped 5.3% following a 0.2% fall in April, while multi-unit sales plummeted 4.8 percentage points. Sales of multi-unit dwellings hit a 2.4% decline in May after lodging a 2.4% increase in April, according to the Housing Industry Association, the trade group which produced the report.      &amp;#039;&amp;#039;New home sales results for 2008 to date confirm a renewed cyclical weakness evident across a range of leading housing indicators, a finding that should surprise nobody given the aggressive tightening in monetary conditions seen over the last 12 months,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; HIA Chief Economist, Harley Dale, said in a statement.       NSW led the decline, with home sales falling 9.4% in May .    Victorian home sales fell 6.8% for the month, followed by Western Australia, which edged down 4.9%.      South Australian homes sales eased 2.7%, while in Queensland, they were off only 2%, according to the HIA survey, which is drawn from a sample survey of the top 100 residential builders in Australia.      The HIA report comes hours before the Reserve Bank of Australia will meet to decide whether to change the cash rate of 7.25%. The announcement, which will be covered by BusinessDay, will be made at 2:30 pm.      In other news, Australian manufacturing activity contracted in June for the first time in five months as companies struggled with rising fuel prices and high interest rates, a report shows.      The Australian Industry Group/PricewaterhouseCoopers performance of manufacturing index fell by 4.2 index points to 47 points in June.      The number was below the 50 point level, which separates an expansion from a contraction, for the first time since January.      Australian Industry Group chief executive Heather Ridout said the fall in manufacturing activity was not unexpected.      &amp;#039;&amp;#039;Pressures on manufacturers from factors such as the high dollar and interest rates and the weaker global economy are being compounded on the supply side, by rapid increases in the costs of fuel and other key inputs such as steel and agricultural goods,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; she said.      &amp;#039;&amp;#039;As well, exporters are still finding it tough in this appreciating Australian dollar environment.      &amp;#039;&amp;#039;Economic policy will need to strike a fine balance between engineering a slowdown in inflation and avoiding too sharp a slowdown in economic growth and employment.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      Mrs Ridout said the decision by South Pacific Tyres last week to shut its factory in Melbourne in part reflected the cost pressures faced by businesses and the difficulty in competing with low-cost, emerging economies.      The resources-boom state of Western Australia reported a strong rise in activity, but the story was gloomy in the rest of the nation.      Manufacturing activity expanded in just two sectors in June, compared with six in May.      Production, employment and new orders fell sharply in June but inventories stayed firm.       czappone@fairfax.com.au
