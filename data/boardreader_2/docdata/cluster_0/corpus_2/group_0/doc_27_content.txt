......          Follow the oil, not the  futures    This reasoning holds obvious appeal for those  looking for a scapegoat. But there is little evidence  to support it. For one thing, the surge in investment  in oil futures is not that large relative to the  global trade in oil. Barclays Capital, an investment  bank, calculates that index funds, which have  especially exercised the politicians because they  always bet on rising prices, account for only 12% of  the outstanding contracts on NYMEX and have a value  equivalent to just 2% of the worlds yearly oil  consumption.        More importantly, neither index funds nor other  speculators ever buy any physical oil. Instead, they  buy futures and options which they settle with a cash  payment when they fall due. In essence, these are  bets on which way the oil price will move. Since the  real currency of such contracts is cash, rather than  barrels of crude, there is no limit to the number of  bets that can be made. And since no oil is ever held  back from the market, these bets do not affect the  price of oil any more than bets on a football match  affect the  result.        The market for nickel provides a good illustration  of this. Speculative investment in the metal has been  growing steadily over the past year, yet its price  has fallen by half. By the same token, the prices of  several commodities that are not traded on any  exchanges, such as iron ore and rice, have been  rising almost as fast as that of  oil.        Speculators do play an important role in setting the  price of oil and other raw materials. But they do so  based on their expectations of future trends in  supply and demand, not on whims. If they had somehow  managed to push prices to unjustified heights, then  demand would contract, leaving unsold pools of  oil.        The futures market does sometimes signal that prices  are likely to rise, which might prompt speculators to  hoard oil in anticipation. But it is not signalling  that at the moment, and there is no sign of hoarding.  In the absence of rising stocks, it is hard to argue  that the oil markets have lost their grip on  reality.        Some claim that oil producers are in effect hoarding  oil below the ground. But there is also little sign  of that, either among companies or countries: all big  exporters bar Saudi Arabia are pumping as fast as  they can.          It takes two to  contango    Despite their dismal reputation, the oil speculators  provide a vital service. They help airlines and other  big oil consumers to hedge against rising prices, and  so to reduce riska massive boon amid the economic  turmoil. By the same token, they provide oil  producers with more predictable future revenues, and  so allow them to expand more confidently and borrow  more cheaply. That, in turn, should help to lower the  price of oil in the long run. Any attempt to curtail  speculation, by contrast, is likely to make life  harder for firms and oil more  expensive.
