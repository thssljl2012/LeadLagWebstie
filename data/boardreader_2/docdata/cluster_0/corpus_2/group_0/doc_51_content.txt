 Edited on Tue Jul-29-08 01:43 PM by Ghost Dog         (I&amp;#039;ve been busy elsewhere all day).  Note that first thing in the morning over here (around closing time in Asia) the panorama looked like this:    Asian Stocks Decline on Profit, Growth Concerns   Asian stocks fell to the lowest in more than a week after forecasts from Toyota Motor Corp. and Tokyo Electric Power Co. deepened concern that slowing economic growth and higher energy costs will hurt earnings.  Toyota, the world&amp;#039;s largest automaker by market value, dropped as record U.S. gasoline prices eroded overseas sales and Japan&amp;#039;s jobless rate unexpectedly rose. Tokyo Electric, Asia&amp;#039;s biggest utility, declined the most in a week. Commonwealth Bank of Australia led financial companies lower after Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. announced more writedowns and the International Monetary Fund said there is no end in sight to the U.S. housing slump.  ``Company earnings globally are on a long downward trend as we adjust to the new realities,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Takashi Kamiya, who helps oversee $16 billion as chief economist at T&amp;amp;D Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. ``Banks and consumers overextended themselves in the housing bubble and now that is coming back to bite them.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.8 percent to 130.61 as of 4:08 p.m. in Tokyo, set to close at the lowest since July 18. Six stocks retreated for each that rose. Financial stocks accounted for 36 percent of the index&amp;#039;s decline.  Japan&amp;#039;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 1.5 percent to 13,159.45.  Shipping companies retreated, led by Nippon Yusen K.K. and Hanjin Shipping Co., after Lloyd&amp;#039;s List said trade between Asia and Europe fell for the first time in seven years in June . All Asian markets declined except for Sri Lanka.   /...  http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;amp;sid=aBh...     Australian banking sector crumbles   The global credit crunch deepened yesterday as ANZ Bank of Australia warned its annual profit could fall by as much as 25% and hiked its bad loan provisions, triggering a massive share sell-off in the country&amp;#039;s financial services sector.  In a scenario that may sound familiar to Canadians, the resource-heavy Australian economy has been flying high in recent years as skyrocketing commodity prices and booming real estate combined to boost growth across most sectors.  But as in this country, the party may be coming to an end.  ANZ, Australia&amp;#039;s fourth-largest bank, said net earnings could fall by A$800-million ($783-million) after taking A$1.2-billion in provisions in the second half because of deteriorating credit conditions and a softening economy.  News of the provisions -- totalling A$2.2-billion for the full year -- caused the shares to drop more than 10%, the biggest one-day decline in 21 years.  ANZ&amp;#039;s troubles come after National Australia Bank surprised the market on Friday with loan-loss provisions of A$830-million for collateralized debt obligations linked to U. S. subprime mortgages.  Unlike National Australia Bank, ANZ&amp;#039;s problems are mostly homegrown, caused by deterioration in the country&amp;#039;s housing market -- which, like Canada&amp;#039;s, is taking a breather after several years of dramatic growth -- along with a weakening economy.  Since NAB&amp;#039;s Friday announcement, Australia&amp;#039;s five largest banks have together surrendered more than A$27-billion of market value.  /...  http://www.nationalpost.com/todays_paper/story.html?id=...     Global markets are strained   WASHINGTON - Global markets are still under strain from the U. S. housing crisis, and financial instability almost everywhere is making it tougher to raise interest rates to combat inflation, the International Monetary Fund said yesterday.  &amp;quot;Global financial markets continue to be fragile and indicators of systemic risk remain elevated,&amp;quot; the IMF said in an update of its semi-annual Global Financial Stability report.  At the moment, a bottom for the U. S. housing market is not visible.  Polls show economic worries lead voter concerns by a wide margin. After a week out of the country meeting world leaders and discussing foreign policy, Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama said he is anxious to shift gears to high gas prices, home foreclosures and bank failures.  &amp;quot;People are worried about gas prices, they&amp;#039;re worried about job security, they&amp;#039;re worried about their retirement fund as the stock market goes down,&amp;quot; Mr. Obama told a gathering of minority journalists in Chicago on Sunday. &amp;quot; People are understandably concerned about the immediate effects of the economy , and that&amp;#039;s what we will be talking about for the duration,&amp;quot; he said.  /...  http://www.nationalpost.com/todays_paper/story.html?id=...     In Japan, new signs of worsening economy   TOKYO - Japan&amp;#039;s economy showed more signs of deterioration as government data revealed Tuesday that the unemployment rate inched up and consumers tightened their purse strings amid rising food and oil prices.  Japan&amp;#039;s jobless rate in June climbed to 4.1 percent from 4.0 percent in May, the highest level since last September, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications said.  In another sign, the ministry said Japan&amp;#039;s household spending in June dropped 1.8 percent from a year earlier, marking the fourth consecutive monthly decline.  Global rises in energy and food prices prompted consumers to be thrifty in those areas. Household spending on food dropped 3.6 percent, while outlays for clothing dropped 13.8 percent from a year earlier. Health and medical expenses also shrank 11.9 percent, according to the ministry report.  /...  http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080729/ap_on_bi_ge/japan_e...     European Factors - Shares set to join global sell-off    LONDON, July 29 (Reuters) - European shares were set to fall sharply on Tuesday, after U.S. and Asian equities tumbled overnight on intensifying concerns about a fragile financial sector.   At 0634 GMT, futures for the Eurostoxx 50 STXEc1, Germany&amp;#039;s DAX FDXc1 and the French CAC 40 FCEc1 were down between 0.9 and 1.1 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst index  lost 0.9 percent in the previous session.   Asian stocks tumbled on Tuesday after Merrill Lynch (MER.N: Quote, Profile, Research, Stock Buzz), the third-largest U.S. investment bank, said it would take a $5.7 billion writedown related to bad debt, draining confidence in the unstable sector. Merrill Lynch shares fell 4.9 percent in extended trade on Monday.   &amp;quot; No one is expecting Merrill to be the last to reveal skeletons in the cupboard and come out with the begging bowl ,&amp;quot; Oliver Stevens, head of dealing at IG Index, said in a note. &amp;quot;The first one to fail is likely to go the way of Bear Stearns and I doubt it&amp;#039;ll be the last,&amp;quot; he added.   In the previous session major Wall Street indexes slid about 2 percent on fears of more credit and housing market turmoil and as major companies posted a mixed bag of results.  /...  http://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idINL9122522...
