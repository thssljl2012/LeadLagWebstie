  Oil price surges above $143 a barrel for first time    LONDON, England (AP) -- Oil prices have surged above $143 a barrel for the first time.      Light, sweet crude for August delivery rose $3.31 to $143.52 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, by midday in Europe.      On Friday, crude futures spiked to a record $142.99 a barrel in New York before closing at $140.21.      David Moore, a commodity strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia says the main factors before today&amp;#039;s rise are the weak U.S. dollar and geopolitical tensions, particularly surrounding Iran.      Traders are digesting reported comments from the commander of Iran&amp;#039;s Revolutionary Guards, who warned that if his country is attacked, Tehran would strike back by barraging Israel with missiles.      In a report published Saturday in the conservative Jam-e-Jam newspaper, Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari said that if Iran were provoked, it would also move to control a key oil passageway in the Gulf.       http://edition.cnn.com/2008/BUSINESS/06/30/oil.peak.ap/
