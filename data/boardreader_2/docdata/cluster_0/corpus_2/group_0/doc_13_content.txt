 Attempts of EURUSD to move up is rebuffed at the level at $1.5870/80. In this moment the currency pair is quoted at $1.5872, testing interest to sell at the level of $1.5840/30. A break below may pave a way to further bids at the Wednesday and intraday low at $1.5810/00. If this level is broken through, it is not worth excluding a deep correction, but technical analysts from Barclays Capital said that the single European currency keeps the potential to rise. Barclays noted that EURUSD remains above supports at the level at $1.5750 that protect bearish movement, and speaks about a target of movement to $1.65/70. Analysts pay attention to surging risk of fall of the Euro, if bull trader can not protect the support at $1.5750 and take the last break above $1.60 for fault that points out to the potential of a serious correction.
