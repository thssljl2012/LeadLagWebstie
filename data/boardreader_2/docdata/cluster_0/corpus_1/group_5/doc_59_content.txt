Stock markets en route to big losses after automaker bailout failure  The Canadian Press  TORONTO - Stock markets are headed for a plunge after the proposed US$14-billion bailout of the Detroit-based automakers crashed and burned in the American Senate.  Recession worries are intensifying amid fears the woes of the automakers will sweep through the wider economy, especially ravaging suppliers of parts and raw materials. General Motors and Chrysler have said they could run out of money within weeks without government help.  Adding to job-loss fears was word that Bank of America expects to cut as many as 35,000 jobs over the next three years. More glum economic numbers are expected (at 8:30 a.m. ET) when the U.S. Commerce Department releases retail sales data for November.
