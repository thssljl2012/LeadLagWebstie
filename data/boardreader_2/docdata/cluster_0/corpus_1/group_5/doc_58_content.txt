NEW YORK - Steel stocks fell in Friday premarket trading after the Senate failed to pass a rescue package for carmakers General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and privately held Chrysler LLC.  The companies consume vast amounts of U.S.-produced steel, and the Senate action has increased the likelihood that one or more of the automakers will seek protection from creditors. General Motors and Chrysler have said they could run out of cash within weeks without government help. Ford has said it has enough cash to make it through next year.  Exacerbating investor concern was more bleak economic data  the Commerce department said retail sales fell 1.8 percent in November  the fifth straight monthly decline and late Thursday Bank of America Corp. said it would cut up to 35,000 jobs over the next three years.  Stock market futures plunged and in premarket trading Friday, United States Steel Corp. was down 6.2 percent and AKS Steel Holding Corp. fell 16.5 percent.  Still, investors and analysts who track the steel industry said U.S. steel makers are less dependent on U.S. automaker demand than they used to be.'The belief is not that GM is going away but just that it is going to keep stamping out cars under the protection of bankruptcy,' Peter Sorrentino, manager of Huntington Funds said Friday in a phone interview.'(Many investors) have already factored in a prepackaged bankruptcy as well as a big drop in production. Factories won't stop running. Plus we may get a big infrastructure spending bill early next year.'KeyBanc analyst Mark Parr said in a client note Friday that U.S. steel makers are showing 'incredible resilience,' and have gotten better about keeping production in line with demand.
