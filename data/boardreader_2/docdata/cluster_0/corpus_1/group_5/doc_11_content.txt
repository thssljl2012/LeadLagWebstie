THE Australian stock market has closed lower on the back of weaker resources and banking sectors after Wall Street eased at the weekend.  At the 1615 AEDT close, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 58.3 points points, or 1.61 per cent, at 3557.4 points, while the broader All Ordinaries index was 54.9 points, or 1.55 per cent lower, at 3492.3 points.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was down 56 points at 3543 points on a volume of 12,630 contracts, according to preliminary calculations.  ABN Amro Morgans private client adviser Craig Walker said trading was relatively quiet given the lead-up to Christmas. 'We didn't get much of a lead from the United States markets on Friday, and our market is down around 60 points so it's probably a little bit worse than what you may have anticipated,' he said. 'But it's probably just people exiting positions before the Christmas break.' Mr Walker said another fall in the oil price had affected most energy stocks, and consumer staples stocks were lower reflecting a lack of confidence among consumers.  In the resources sector, global miner BHP Billiton fell 28 cents to $29.64 while Rio Tinto was down $1.61 at $37.40.  Coal seam gas (CSG) explorer Pure Energy Resources skyrocketed $1.49, or 50 per cent, to $4.47 on news it had agreed to be taken over by CSG producer Arrow Energy in a cash-and-scrip deal valuing the target at about $490 million. Arrow Energy sagged 24 cents to $1.95.  Manganese miner OM Holdings shed seven cents to $1.00 as it closed out some foreign currency hedges that expire next year, realising a mark-to-market loss of $13.1 million.  Oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum was 30 cents richer at $32.75 and Santos descended 67 cents to $13.62.  Among the major banks, National Australia Bank dumped 39 cents at $19.61, ANZ gained 22 cents at $14.86 and Westpac fell 53 cents to $16.78.  Commonwealth Bank retreated 74 cents at $27.06.  A Commonwealth Bank spokesperson declined to comment on whether the Australian Securities and Investments Commission was investigating whether the bank had breached its continuous disclosure obligations over its $2 billion capital raising last week.  The concern arose when the bank said it expected a rise in expected bad debts, but did not notify the market as a whole.  On Wall Street on Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index lost 25.88 points, or 0.30 per cent, at 8,579.11.
