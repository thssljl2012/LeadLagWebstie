European markets sank sharply on Friday after the bailout talks for the embattled US carmarkers collapsed and JP Morgan said it had a terrible November and December, knocking the banking sector. "We are down across the board today after the failure last night to agree an automaker bailout. We have seen a lot of investors taking their profits and watching and waiting. With the weekend to come and some presents to be bought, who came blame investors from taking their well earned gains from this week," said Joshua Raymond, Market Strategist at City Index. Shrinking car industry hits French output - Dec-10In mid-morning trade, the pan-European FTSE Eurofirst 300 fell 4 per cent to 820, in Frankfurt, the Xetra Dax lost 4.1 per cent to 4,569.79, in Paris the CAC 40 dropped 4.9 per cent to 3,145.55. In France, Renault lost 7.2 per cent to 17.54, while Peugeot shed 5.6 per cent to 12.57. In Germany, BMW lost 4.1 per cent to 21.51, Daimler shed 7.2 per cent to 23.27 and car-part manufacturer Continental lost 6.1 per cent to 35.11 on worries that a possible collapse of GM and Chrysler would knock suppliers globally. The US is the biggest market for BMW and the second-biggest for Daimler's Mercedes-Benz. Both carmakers have factories there, and they and other German brands control about 7 per cent of the American market. "GM and Chysler previously expressed that they are running out of cash at the end of the fourth quarter 2008. This will have severe implications for the global supply chain. We estimate that the Big-3 have among their debt trade payables to suppliers of some $50bn globally, hitting a financially weak supplier base," said Commerzbank. JP Morgan's CEO said that November was a "terrible trading month" adding that December also looked bleak, which slammed battered banking stocks. News that Bank of America plans to slash 30,000 to 35,000 jobs over the next three years dealt another blow to the sector. BNP Paribas tumbled 9.5 per cent to 42.30, Credit Agricole lost 8.7 per cent to 14.17 while UBS and Credit Suisse lost 8.2 per cent to SFr14.46 and 8 per cent to SFr29.66 respectively.
