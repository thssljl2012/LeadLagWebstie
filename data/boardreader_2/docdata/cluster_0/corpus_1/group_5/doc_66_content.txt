HONG KONG (XFN-ASIA) - Share prices finished the morning higher as bargain-hunting emerged after steep falls on Friday due to worries over the fate of the US auto bailout plan. Sentiment improved today after Wall Street shook off the news of the bailout plan stalemate to close moderately higher on Friday, and after China unveiled a new 30-point plan to stimulate domestic consumption. The Hang Seng index closed the morning up 452.46 points or 3.1 pct at 15,210.85, off a low of 15,120.39 and a high of 15,386.90. Turnover was 25.4 bln hkd. The Hang Seng China Enterprises index gained 189.44 points or 2.4 pct at 8,101.20. Local property counters led the charge on continued hopes that local lenders will cut their interest rates in step with a widely expected easing by the US Federal Reserve later this week. China stocks, particularly retailers, attracted some interest after Beijing announced a new stimulus package. It includes a 17 pct increase in money supply next year and a 4 trln yuan increase in total lending this year. The State Council said the measures were designed to 'counteract the blow of the international financial crisis, expand domestic demand, and bolster financial support to ensure stable and relative fast economic development.' However, local bank BOC Hong Kong (Holdings) Ltd fell over 6 pct after announcing Friday that it expects a 'considerable' decline in earnings this year. It is to receive a 2.5 bln usd loan from its mainland parent, Bank of China, to help it 'meet its business development needs and to weather the economic uncertainties arising from the global financial turmoil.' China Construction Bank also fell, giving up nearly 4 pct, after reports that its strategic investor Bank of America plans to place up 3.0 bln usd worth of the mainland lender's H-shares. The property sub-index surged 855.38 points or 5.02 pct to 17,892.05, while the financial sub-index was up 445.66 points or 1.9 pct at 23,485.35. 'Share prices rebounded on bargain-hunting after Friday's steep falls. A late rally on Wall Street on Friday and Beijing's announcement of new economic stimulus measures over the weekend helped lift market sentiment,' said Peter Lai, a director at DBS Vickers. 'Continued expectations of interest rate cuts also pushed property counters higher,' he said. 'However, again, this will be merely another technical rebound rather than a fundamental turnaround as we are not out of the woods yet,' Lai said. 'There are still many uncertainties on the economic front... you also have a looming credit-card bad debt crisis now,' he said. Lai sees strong resistance around 16,200 on the benchmark Hang Seng index. 'Upside room for share prices is very limited from current levels. The best you can see is a range-bound move in the near term,' he said. Dennis Poon, head of research at South China Securities, said the new stimulus measures announced by China over the weekend helped improve sentiment and encouraged buying of mainland banks and retailers. In a statement posted on its website late Saturday, China's State Council said money supply will be increased by 17 pct in 2009, a substantial rise over the 15 pct rate in the year to this October. To support domestic consumption, initiatives in support of first-time homebuyers and low-cost housing projects will be launched and the development of a car loan business will be encouraged, it added. However, new bad economic data capped gains of China-related shares. The National Bureau of Statistics said today that industrial value-added output in November was up 5.4 pct year-on-year, slowing sharply from 8.2 pct in October, the lowest non-holiday result since the series started in 1999. Poon also noted expectations for interest rate cuts by local banks. However, he warned that a reduction in Hong Kong rates was not a foregone conclusion, noting that HSBC and other local banks had recently raised their mortgage rates. Among large-caps, HSBC was up 2.65 hkd or 3.2 pct at 84.9, China Mobile gained 2.6 hkd or 3.3 pct to 81.1, China Life climbed 0.85 hkd or 3.7 pct to 23.9, Hong Kong Exchanges &amp;amp; Clearing was up 3.1 hkd or 4.2 pct at 76.3, and Hutchison Whampoa was up 1.2 hkd or 3 pct at 41.7. Local property firms outperformed on rate cut hopes, with Cheung Kong gaining 2.75 hkd or 3.5 pct to 80.75, Henderson Land up 1.65 hkd or 5.7 pct at 30.65 and Sun Hung Kai rising 3.50 hkd or 5.7 pct to 65.35. China financials attracted some interest on expectations that expanded lending will boost their earnings. ICBC gained 0.08 hkd or 1.9 pct to 4.35, Bank of China was up 0.03 hkd or 1.3 pct at 2.42, China Merchants Bank gained 0.32 hkd or 2.1 pct to 15.52 and China CITIC Bank was up 0.05 hkd or 1.8 pct at 2.8. China Construction Bank lost 0.18 hkd or 3.9 pct to 4.41 on reports that strategic investor Bank of America plans to place up to 3.0 bln usd of CCB H-shares. The shares will be sold at a discount of 13 to 17 pct to their last closing price of 4.59 hkd per share, the Apple Daily said, quoting unidentified sources. Bank of America denied the reports. Mainland retail counters were higher, with Parkson Group surging 0.45 hkd or 5.8 pct to 8.16, Intime Department Store soaring 0.22 hkd or 11 pct to 2.22 and Belle International up 0.07 hkd or 2.0 pct at 3.61. South China Securities' Poon said China automakers posted sharp gains on relief after the Bush administration said it would find funds to support America's troubled automakers after the Senate refused to allocate more money on Thursday. 'Most Chinese automakers have joint venture projects with their US counterparts and moves to prevent the latter from going bankrupt have been received positively by many investors,' Poon said. Dongfeng Group surged 0.21 hkd or 10.3 pct to 2.25 and Brilliance China jumped 0.025 hkd or 6.3 pct to 0.42. BYD Co gained 0.48 hkd or 6.2 pct to 11.92 following a report that it would unveil today an electric car intended for mass production in China. The Wall Street Journal reported that the company will present to the media in Shenzhen the battery-powered F3DM, capable of being charged from household power outlets. The car has been marketed to potential fleet customers and will be available to consumers from the end of this month. Among mainland property firms, China Overseas Land rose 0.66 hkd or 6.4 pct to 11.0, Guangzhou R&amp;amp;F Properties was up 0.16 hkd or 2.3 pct at 7.05 and Country Garden gained 0.05 hkd or 3 pct to 1.73. Among local banks, Hang Seng Bank rose 3.1 hkd or 3.0 pct to 107.80 and Bank of East Asia surged 0.52 hkd or 3.1 pct to 17.5. BOC Hong Kong (Holdings) fell 0.55 hkd or 6.042 pct to 8.55 after announcing Friday that it expects a 'considerable' decline in this year's earnings as a result of the impact of the global slump and increased volatility in financial markets. It also said it reached a preliminary agreement with its corporate parent Bank of China to draw down by December 23 a subordinated credit facility of 2.5 bln usd.
