At 1200 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was up 36.3 points, or 1.03 per cent, to 3,567.7, while the broader All Ordinaries index gained 33.1 points, or 0.98 per cent, at 3,501.3.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was 92 points lower at 3,558 on a volume of 8,849 contracts.  The stock market will close around 1430 AEDT and will not trade again until Monday, December 29.  CMC Markets corporate dealer Andrew Knight said the Australian market's move upwards on Wednesday was surprising given that US markets were lower overnight, and pre-Christmas trading was typically thin.  'The banks on the whole are seeing a bit of buoyancy coming in but there's no volume behind it,' he said.  'The consumer staples (stocks) and the telcos seem to be standing out at the moment, but apart from that it does seem to be driven by a bit of sentiment coming into the market after two down days this week.'

Commonwealth Bank surrendered 14 cents to $26.90 as it said it would acquire up to $4 billion of mortgages originated by Wizard Home Loans.  On Wall Street overnight, stocks fell in thin trading as US growth and housing data showed that the US economy continued to struggle.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average index lost 100.28 points, or 1.18 per cent, to 8,419.49.  The broader Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 index was 8.47 points, or 0.97 per cent, lower at 863.16.
