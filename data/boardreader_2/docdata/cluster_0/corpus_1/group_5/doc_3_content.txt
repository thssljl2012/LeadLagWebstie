SYDNEY, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Australian shares reversed early gains on Tuesday as losses in top miners including BHP Billiton Ltd outweighed gains in the largest banks, such as Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index fell 12.3 points to 3,545.1 points by 0015 GMT. Investors said the market was in a listless trade ahead of the year-end holidays, although they will likely stay away from banking stocks when trading picks up next year due to the ongoing turmoil in financial markets. 'People are winding down their activities in the market before the holidays,' said Albert Hung, chief investment officer at Alleron Investment Management. 'But people will try to avoid financial services stocks until there are signs of easing in the credit crunch,' Hung said. New Zealand's benchmark NXZ 50 index was down 0.26 percent at 2,672.8 points. STOCKS ON THE MOVE * Australian electronics and furniture retailer Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd added 0.9 percent to A$2.37 after it said its sales in the 28 days to Dec 21 rose 8.7 percent, but that retail margins were under pressure. 0027 GMT * Banks gained, with Commonwealth up 0.8 percent at A$27.28 and National Australia Bank up 1.2 percent at A$19.85. 0027 GMT * BHP led losses, falling 1.6 percent to A$29.17 on concerns about demand for metals. Fellow miner Rio Tinto Ltd fell 1 percent to A$37.04. Both companies' London-listed shares had fallen, with a rate cut by China failing to overcome demand worries. 0020 GMT (Reporting by Koh Gui Qing) ((Guiqing.Koh@thomsonreuters.com; Reuters Messaging; guiqing.koh.reuters.com@reuters.net; +61 2 9373 1821)) DIARIES &amp;amp; DATA: IPO diary &amp;amp; data Asia earnings diary U.S. earnings diary European diary Australia diary Wall Street Week Ahead Eurostocks Week Ahead ................................................................
