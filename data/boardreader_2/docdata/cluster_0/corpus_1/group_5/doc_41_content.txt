U.S. stocks rebounded from early weakness to flirt with positive territory on Thursday, with energy stocks rising as crude oil prices surged another 11% on a weak dollar and expectations of upcoming production cuts.  The energy sector jumped 4% as crude oil futures rose $5.12, or 11.6%, to $ 48.57 a barrel, extending a rally from the previous session.  The rest of the market, however, remained flat to negative amid ongoing concerns about a bailout for the U.S. auto industry. Late Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a $14 billion federal loan package to the Big Three automakers in a 237-170 vote.  'The bill now has to go through the Senate where it is expected to face a tougher challenge,' said Robert Kavcic, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 20 points, or 0.2%, at 8,782, off a morning low of 8,617.  Among blue-chips, shares of Chevron Corp. (CVX) jumped 4% and those of Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) rose nearly 2%.  Weighing on the Dow, shares of General Motors Corp. (GM) slumped 6%, while away from the Dow, Ford Motor Co. (F) shares fell 4%.  Financial blue chips were also under pressure, with JP Morgan Chase (JPM) off 4.5%, Citigroup (C) down 5% and Bank of America (BAC) down 3.6%.  Also on the Dow, household products giant Procter &amp;amp; Gamble lowered its sales growth forecasts for the current quarter. The company, however, said it still expects to meet its previously earnings forecasts and its shares rose 0.6%.  The S&amp;amp;P 500 index (SPX) rose 1.9 points, or 0.2%, to 901, while the Nasdaq Composite (RIXF) fell 0.4 points, or 0.1%, to 1,565.  By sector on the S&amp;amp;P, energy led the gains, followed by health care, up 2.7%, and utilities, up 1.1%.  The telecommunication sector was also under pressure, down 0.8%. Shares of Sprint Nextel Corp. (US-S) slumped 13% after Moody's Investors Service cut the company's unsecured debt to 'junk' status. The downgrade comes as the telecom carrier's market position has weakened significantly and as Sprint Nextel continues to seek a turnaround in its wireless operations, the debt-rating agency said.  Also on the telecom front, the $41 billion leveraged buyout of Canadian carrier BCE Inc. (BCE) ended after auditors KPMG concluded the company that would have emerged from the deal wouldn't be solvent.  Separately, discount retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) fell 1% after reporting on Thursday that fiscal first-quarter net income was about flat, reflecting bargain-hunting shoppers looking for deals in a downbeat economy. Same store sales edged up 1% and total sales rose 3.6%.  More economic gloom  Stocks first came under pressure after the Labor Department reported that initial unemployment claims jumped to a 26-year high last week.  First-time filings for state unemployment benefits jumped by 58,000 to a total of 573,000. The number of people collecting unemployment benefits rose by 338, 000 to 4.43 million, also the highest since late 1982, the Labor Department said. The 338,000 increase in the week ending Nov. 29 was the most since 1974.  Separate reports showed that import prices fell and the U.S. trade deficit unexpectedly increased.  The dollar came under heavy selling pressure, falling 1.3% against a basket of six major counterparts in recent action. Besides the weak U.S. reports, the dollar came under pressure against a sharply higher euro following comments from European Central Bank member Axel Weber, who said that  A weaker dollar tends to boost dollar-denominated commodities, such as crude oil and gold, as it makes them cheaper to buy for holders of other currencies. Besides oil's surge, gold rose 2.5%, helping to lift the shares of some miners such as Freeport McMoRan Copper &amp;amp; Gold.  Stocks closed higher Wednesday on Wall Street, boosted by progress on the bailout, though opposition to the plan from several Senate Republicans shaved earlier gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended the session up 70 points, while the S&amp;amp;P 500 gained 10 points and the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 18 points.
