The Wall Street Journal on Monday reported Merrill's chief executive, John Thain, has suggested to directors that he receive a 2008 bonus of as much as $10 million, but the company's compensation committee has balked at the request.  New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo told the board of Merrill Lynch on Monday that the reported bonus of $10 million for Chief Executive John Thain 'appears unjustified.' Cuomo said in a letter to the board that Merrill Lynch has lost more than $11 billion over the year and that 'the performance of Merrill's top executives throughout Merrill's abysmal year in no way justifies significant bonuses for its top executives, including the CEO.'
