The Australian sharemarket bounced back at noon as strong resources stocks helped the market shrug off a negative lead from Wall Street.  At 1200 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was up 20.8 points, or 0.58 per cent, at 3,625.1, while the broader All Ordinaries was up 20.6 points, or 0.58 per cent, at 3,554.3.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index contract was up 18 points at 3,633 on a volume of 15,770 contracts. 'Given the American market was down, we've seen a strong movement upwards as the day has unfolded,' Austock Securities senior client adviser Michael Heffernan said. 'The very strong movers have been the resources stocks with both BHP and Rio really sprinting.' Rio shares rose $1.01 cents, or 3.03 per cent, to $34.36 and BHP Billiton shares lifted $1.07, or 3.76 per cent, to $29.52. 'But the highlight of the morning was the re-starting of trade in Westpac after their capital raising - of course they went down about eight per cent, which is what the other banks did yesterday,' Mr Heffernan said. Commonwealth Bank will place $750 million of shares with Merrill Lynch and use the proceeds to redeem its PERLS II securities in March 2009.  CBA shares lost 65 cents, or 2.17 per cent, to $29.35, National Australia Bank increased 11 cents to $20.01, Westpac fell $1.51, or 8.45 per cent, to $16.37 and ANZ advanced 15 cents to $14.25.  In news on Wednesday, upmarket leather goods maker and clothing retailer OrotonGroup said sales have risen in fiscal 2009 and it seeks further cost cuts.  OrotonGroup shares were steady at $2.20.  Wesfarmers, which owns Coles, was 46 cents, or 2.78 per cent, higher at $17.02 and Woolworths rose 24 cents, or 0.9 per cent, to $26.87.

Agribusiness and automotive products supplier Futuris shares were steady at 79 cents after it completed the sale of its shareholding in Amcom Telecommunications.
