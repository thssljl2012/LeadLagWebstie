Bangkok: Asian markets plunged on Friday after a proposed US government rescue of Detroit's ailing automakers collapsed in the Senate, intensifying fears about a protracted global slump.  More dire economic data from the US - a vital export market - and news of deep job cuts at Bank of America also added to the gloom.  Japan's Nikkei 225 stock average tumbled 484.68 points, or 5.6 per cent, to 8,235.87, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slid 5.9 per cent to 14,692.79. South Korea's Kospi fell 4.4 per cent.  The dollar sank to a 13-year low against the yen, dropping as low as 88.16 yen, and oil fell below $46 (Dh168.8) a barrel. Investors were rattled after a $14 billion bailout for Detroit's struggling Big Three automakers failed to get approval in the US Senate. The collapse came after bipartisan talks on the auto rescue broke down over Republican demands that the United Auto Workers union agree to steep wage cuts by 2009 to bring their pay into line with US plants of Japanese carmakers.  The bankruptcy of any of the big American automakers would deal another blow to the world's largest economy, already in recession, and ripple through export-dependent Asia, as well as global financial markets. 'The automobile sector is a fundamental industry for both the US and Japan, and a failure would be a major blow to Japan as well,' said Nagayuki Yamagishi, a strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities in Tokyo. 'The bailout failure is just the beginning.' US stock index futures pointed to a sell-off yesterday on Wall Street. Dow Jones industrial index futures were down 286 points, or 3.3 per cent, at 8,311 and S&amp;amp;P 500 futures slid 37.30 points, or 4.3 per cent, to 837.20.  Hopes for the US auto industry now appear to rest with President George W. Bush agreeing to tap a $700 billion Wall Street bailout fund for emergency aid. General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC have said they could be weeks from collapse. Ford Motor Co says it does not need federal help now, but its survival is far from certain. 'If a company such as General Motors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection it could strike the Dow below 8,000 again,' said Jackson Wong, investment manager at Tanrich Securities in Hong Kong.  News about the rejected auto bailout sent the dollar as low as 88.16 yen - its lowest level since August 2, 1995 - before it recovered some to 89.70 yen.
