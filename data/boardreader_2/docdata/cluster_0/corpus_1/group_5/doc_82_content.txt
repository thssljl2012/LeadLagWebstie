SYDNEY, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Australian shares extended declines on Tuesday as losses in top miners Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton Ltd outweighed gains in the largest banks, such as Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index fell 1.5 percent, or 52.7 points, to 3,507.4 points by 0115 GMT. New Zealand's benchmark NXZ 50 index was down 0.64 percent at 2,662.7 points. STOCKS ON THE MOVE * Global miner Rio Tinto Ltd fell 5.2 percent to A$35.440 as dealers said they sold the stock on concerns a long and deep global recession will cut demand for commodities and drag on the firm's earnings. BHP was down 4.3 percent at A$28.37. 0313 GMT * Stockland Group, Australia's second-largest real estate trust, rose 5.7 percent to A$3.92 as dealers said the stock looked cheap after its weak performance this year. Stockland is down 53.4 percent this year, underperforming a 44.6 percent drop in the key S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index. Shares in Stockland trade at 8.6 times their 2009 earnings, slightly cheaper than the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index's 9 times, but pricier than the sector average of 4.3 times, Reuters data showed. 0311 GMT * Westfield Group, the world's top shopping-mall owner by market value, rose 3.4 percent to A$13.11 on investors' hopes the government's stimulus package will boost consumer spending over the year-end holidays, and temporarily boost the firm's business. 0307 GMT * Australian fund management firm HFA Holdings plunged 48 percent to a record low of A$0.050 after it said on Tuesday it had halted redemptions from three of its investment funds due to deteriorating liquidity in the funds' underlying investments. HFA said redemptions were halted on Dec 22 in the HFA Diversified Investments Fund, the HFA Octane Fund and the HFA Octane Fund Series 2. 0110 GMT * Australian electronics and furniture retailer Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd added 0.9 percent to A$2.37 after it said its sales in the 28 days to Dec 21 rose 8.7 percent, but that retail margins were under pressure. 0027 GMT * Banks gained, with Commonwealth up 0.8 percent at A$27.28 and National Australia Bank up 1.2 percent at A$19.85. 0027 GMT (Reporting by Koh Gui Qing) ((Guiqing.Koh@thomsonreuters.com; Reuters Messaging; guiqing.koh.reuters.com@reuters.net; +61 2 9373 1821)) DIARIES &amp;amp; DATA: IPO diary &amp;amp; data Asia earnings diary U.S. earnings diary European diary Australia diary Wall Street Week Ahead Eurostocks Week Ahead ................................................................
