President-elect Barack Obama was thinking only about Americans and the U.S. economy when he pledged to ramp up public works spending in a big way to combat rising unemployment and plunging economic growth  but the Canadian stock market was the bigger winner.  The S&amp;amp;P/TSX composite index closed at 8567.12, up 450.09 points, or 5.6 per cent, its biggest gain so far in December. Commodity producers led the way, after commodity prices surged on the premise that infrastructure development will require energy and metals. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of 19 commodities rose 5.2 per cent, the biggest one-day gain since Nov. 24. In particular, crude oil rose $2.90 (U.S.) a barrel, to $43.71.  EnCana Corp. rose 9.3 per cent, Canadian Oil Sands Trust rose 12 per cent, Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. rose 14.1 per cent and Barrick Gold Corp. rose 7.1 per cent. Financials also went along for the ride, with Royal Bank of Canada rising 3 per cent and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce rising 7.1 per cent.  In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8934.18, up 298.76 points, or 3.5 per cent. The broader S&amp;amp;P 500 closed at 909.70, up 33.63 points, or 3.8 per cent. Oil producer Exxon Mobil Corp. rose 3.9 per cent, Bank of America Corp. rose 17.1 per cent, JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. rose 9.4 per cent and General Electric Co. rose 5.8 per cent.  It wasn't a good day for defensive stocks that typically perform well during bad economic times though. McDonald's Corp. fell 2.9 per cent and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. fell 1.1 per cent.
