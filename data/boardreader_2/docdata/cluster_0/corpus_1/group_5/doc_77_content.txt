The decline came even as official data showed that Japan's gross domestic product decreased by a price-adjusted 0.5% during the July-to-September period from the previous quarter, or 1.8% in annualized terms. The decline was bigger than the 0.1% quarter-on-quarter drop in preliminary figures released last month.

Exporters led the gains in Tokyo, with Isuzu Motors (ISUZY) rising 6.6% and Elpida (ELPDF) soaring 10.7%.  Shares of Nintendo (NTDOY) surged 6.8% after Reuters reported sales of the company's popular Wii gaming consoles more than doubled during the Thanksgiving holiday week in the U.S. compared with the year-ago period.

In Sydney, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AU) slumped 7.1%, while National Australia Bank (NABZY) lost 2.8%. Trading in Westpac shares was halted.  The U.S. dollar bought 93 yen in Asian currency trading, compared with 93.04 yen late Monday.  January crude-oil futures advanced 34 cents to $44.05 a barrel in electronic trading, on top of the $2.90, or 7.1%, surge to $43.71 a barrel in the regular session Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
