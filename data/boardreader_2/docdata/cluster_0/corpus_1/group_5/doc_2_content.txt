BANGKOK - ASIAN markets plunged on Friday as a US government rescue of Detroit's ailing automakers collapsed in the Senate and the perilous state of the world economy was underlined by more dire economic data and deep job cuts in the United States.   Japan's Nikkei 225 stock average was down 491.33 points, or 5.6 per cent, to 8,229.22 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slid 6.9 per cent to 14,537.21. South Korea's Kospi fell 4.5 per cent while markets in Singapore, Australia and India fell between 2 per cent and 4 per cent.   The dollar fell below 90 yen and oil also dropped below $46 a barrel.   Investors were rattled after a $14 billion (S$20.8 billion) bailout for Detroit's struggling Big Three automakers failed on a procedural vote. The collapse came after bipartisan talks on the auto rescue broke down over Republican demands that the United Auto Workers union agree to steep wage cuts by 2009 to bring their pay into line with Japanese carmakers.   The bankruptcy of any of US automaker would deal another major blow to the American economy, already in recession, and ripple through export-dependent Asia, as well as global financial markets.   'If a company such as General Motors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection it could strike the Dow below 8,000 again,' said Mr Jackson Wong, investment manager at Tanrich Securities in Hong Kong.   'Even though China's government has been announcing plans to support the markets and the economy, Asia would follow Wall Street down,' he said.   Hopes for the US auto industry now appear to rest with President George W. Bush agreeing to tap the $700 billion Wall Street bailout fund for emergency aid. General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC have said they could be weeks from collapse. Ford Motor Co says it does not need federal help now, but its survival is far from certain.   Auto stocks in Asia plummeted on the news.   In Tokyo, Toyota Motor Co. dived 10.6 per cent and Honda Motor Co slid 12.9 per cent. South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co shed 8.5 per cent and Kia Motors Corp was off 8.4 per cent.   There was also more grim jobs data from the US with new unemployment benefit applications reaching their highest level since November 1982 and Bank of America Corp announced it expects to cut 30,000 to 35,000 jobs over the next three years.   The Dow Jones industrial average Thursday fell 196.33 points, or 2.2 per cent, to 8,565.09.   Futures pointed to a sell-off on Friday on Wall Street. Dow futures were down 286 points, or 3.3 per cent, at 8,311 and S&amp;amp;P 500 futures slid 36 points, or 4.2 per cent, to 838.   The past week of gains in world markets was 'more predicated on hope than reality,' said Mr Arjuna Mahendran, head of Asian investment strategy at HSBC Private Bank in Singapore.   'This has been a typical bear market rally. It's been based on very high expectations of Mr Obama's fiscal stimulus plan. It's been based one expectations and nothing else,' he said.   President-elect Barack Obama last weekend flagged a massive stimulus package for the US economy once he takes office in late January, pledging the largest public works programme since the creation of the US interstate highway network a half-century ago.   In currency trading, the dollar fell to 89.66 yen from 91.43 yen late on Thursday in New York.   Oil prices retreated after jumping the previous day. Light, sweet crude for January delivery fell $2.41 to $45.57 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange by midafternoon in Singapore.   KUALA LUMPUR  The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index (KLCI) futures contracts on Bursa Malaysia Derivatives were lower at mid-day, tracking the lower cash market, dealers said.   Spot month December 2008 declined 12 points to 847.0, January 2009 and March 2009 lost 14.5 points each to 841.0 and 831.0 respectively while June 2009 went down 15.5 points to 811.0.   Turnover stood at 4,048 lots.   The underlying KLCI fell 12.2 points to 848.48.   TOKYO  Japan's Nikkei stock index closed down 5.56 per cent on Friday after the US Senate failed to pass a rescue plan for ailing automakers, raising fears of fresh turmoil on Wall Street.   The Nikkei dropped 484.68 points to 8,235.87, with automakers and other exporters falling sharply after the dollar sank below 90 yen for the first time in 13 years due to fears of a collapse of the Big Three US carmakers.   SHANGHAI  Chinese share prices fell 1.69 per cent by midday on Friday due to concerns about weak fourth quarter earnings and Beijing's lack of new economy-boosting measures, dealers said.   Investors remained worried after the government released worse-than-expected November macroeconomic figures over the past week without providing any fresh policy cues, traders said.   'Investors prefer to sit on (the) sidelines, and (wait) to see what Beijing could do to boost the economy over the weekend,' Mr Zhou Lin, an analyst at Huatai Securities, told Dow Jones Newswires.   The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and B shares, was down 34.43 points at 1,997.25.   The Shanghai A-share index lost 36.09 points, or 1.69 per cent, to 2,097.42, while the Shenzhen A-share index shed 13.68 points, or 2.14 per cent, to 626.55.   HONG KONG  Hong Kong share prices opened down 2.1 per cent on Friday, following Wall Street's fall on worries over an auto industry bailout, dealers said.   The benchmark Hang Seng index was down 326.20 points at 15,287.70. -- AFP, BERNAMA, AP
