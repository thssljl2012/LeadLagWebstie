'Despite the increasingly challenging environment we believe MDME is well positioned -- the company operates a low risk costing strategy, has $14 million of cash on its balance sheet and according to management has a fully utilised staff base until well into (fiscal year) 2010,' the broker says. 'Furthermore, we would highlight that MDME's expertise in gold and uranium process plants, two commodities that have thus far proven to be relatively resilient to the downturn in global commodity prices,' it adds. The broker also says, however, it will bring down its 2009 numbers in light of the fact the Metorex Kinsenda copper project - which the broker had expected to contribute about $5 million of earnings in the second half - has been suspended. Numis has its recommendation and target price under review.

Euronav shares rise as much as 6.7 percent 9.40 euros after hitting a 2008 low of 8.25 euros on Dec. 2. Shares in Norwegian peer Frontline trade up as much as 13.9 percent and the U.S.'s Overseas Shipholding Group Inc is expected to rise at open, KBC Securities analyst Wouter Vanderhaeghen says. The gains are due to improved daily rates for the VLCCs used by the crude oil shipping sector. Average daily rates soared 67 percent last week to almost $73,000, according to Vanderhaeghen. The market is now differentiating between the oil shipping sector, which Vanderhaeghen says remains promising, and the dry bulk shipping sector, which has seen its daily rates nosedive in a market plagued by consistent overcapacity. 'The fundamentals for the oil tanker sector are better, or healthier, than the outlook for dry bulk,' Vangerhaeghen says.

Both stocks outperform a 5.8 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx construction and materials index.

Societe Generale says in a research report the main risk to Enel is partner Acciona's sale of 25 percent of Spain's Endesa for 10.8 billion euros under a put option. Enel is already majority owner of Endesa. The bank says Enel could cut its debt taken on to buy Endesa by 2.5 billion to 3 billion euros by selling gas and power networks. A listing of renewables unit Green Power in the second quarter of 2009 could cut debt by the same amount, it says. Enel would have the 'financial headroom' to buy the stake in Endesa, it says, but cites Forbes.com as saying last month that both companies have decided against an early break-up of their pact. Enel last week denied a report in Spain's El Mundo newspaper, saying it had offered Acciona 12 billion euros for the stake.

'The entire insurance sector is up but Aegon gets an extra swing from the ING note,' says Rob Koenders, an asset manager at Harmony Vermogensbeheer. ING analyst Albert Ploegh says in the note that Aegon is 'deeply discounted', adding that its diversified earnings make it less cyclical than its peers. 'We see it as a good play on a bond market recovery,' he says.

Five-year CDS are bid at 17.5 percent upfront and offered at 18.5 percent upfront, according to Markit data. Fitch on Friday said it may cut Lafarge's BBB rating, citing concerns that weak trading conditions will deteriorate even further in 2009, resulting in lower cash flow generation. Four credits, including Lafarge, in the 125-name Europe iTraxx investment-grade index are now trading upfront, Markit data shows. The other three are Swiss-based commodities firm Glencore, car parts and tyre maker Continental and British engineering company GKN .
