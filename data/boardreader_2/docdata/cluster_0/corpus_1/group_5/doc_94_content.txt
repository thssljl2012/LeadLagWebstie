MELBOURNE, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Australian shares slid 1.7 percent, defying Wall Street's rally, as bank shares sank after Westpac Banking Corp announced a $1.7 billion share sale and investors feared other equity raisings were on the cards. Following a three-day rebound in the banking sector, investors were taking profits to buy up the new Westpac shares. 'The capital raising by Westpac has dragged a lot of funds out of the market,' said Shaw Stockbroking dealer Jamie Spiteri. Alongside Westpac, top steelmaker BlueScope Steel was on a trading halt ahead of announcing capital management plans, which weighed down on other industrial stocks, including coal-to-groceries conglomerate Wesfarmers Ltd. 'It's a reminder that there's still going to be an ongoing call for additional capital, maybe not this side of the new year, but possibly on the other side of the new year,' said Spiteri. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index fell 61.9 points to 3,569.7 by 2358 GMT, following a 4.1 percent rally on Monday. While Westpac was on a trading halt for its share placement, priced at an 11 percent discount, at A$16, shares in Commonwealth Bank of Australia slid 6.9 percent to A$30.55, and National Australia Bank and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group fell around 2.6 percent. That took the shine off gains in miners, with heavyweight BHP Billiton up 4.5 percent at A$28.42 and Rio Tinto up 2.8 percent at A$32.94, spurred by hopes a massive U.S. infrastructure spending plan would boost demand for metals. New Zealand's NZX50 rose 0.8 percent to 2,721.3.
