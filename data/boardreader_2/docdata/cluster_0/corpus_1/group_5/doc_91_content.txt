THE share market opened strong in early trading after Wall Street gained on Friday, on hopes the US government will act further to lift the economy out of recession.  At 10.13 (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index had added 63 points, or 1.81 per cent, to 3553, while the broader All Ordinaries index increased 57.9 points, or 1.69 per cent, at 3485.1  Cameron Securities client adviser Adrian Leppinus said the local market was cautiously following the US higher, given that Friday's rally on Wall Street had been very late in the day.  'The volumes are still small so people aren't convinced they should get in yet,'' Mr Leppinus said.  He said share prices were getting to levels where people would get a good return from dividends alone, compared with cash deposits, where returns had been eroded by falling interest rates.  'It's getting to the point where people are saying they need to invest so they are looking for places where they can get fully franked dividends,'' Mr Leppinus said.  The big banks, which include three of the five biggest companies, all gained.  Commonwealth Bank rose 2.6 per cent to $31.69, National Australia Bank increased three per cent, to $20.40, Westpac added 40 cents to $17.25 and ANZ advanced 21 cents to $14.81.  Resources however were a mixed bag.  BHP Billiton, the biggest company on the exchange pushed the market higher, rising 55 cents to $26.70.  But rival miner Rio Tinto fell 60 cents to $31.40.  The price of gold in Sydney was $US757.75 per fine ounce, down on Friday's close of $US767.20.  Among gold stocks, Lihir was four cents lower at $2.21, Newcrest added six cents to $25.14, while Newmont was untraded at $4.65 after going ex dividend.  The oil price also slumped to a four-year low on Friday, helping transport stocks.  Light, sweet crude for January delivery fell $US2.86 to close at $US40.81 a barrel in New York.  Toll Holdings gained 5.1 per cent to $5.82, Transurban Group increased 4.5 per cent to $4.83 and Qantas rose 3.2 per cent to $2.29.  In the US stocks gained despite the news that the world's biggest economy lost more than half a million jobs last month. Stocks reversed early losses and closed sharply higher as the data raised hopes that Washington will again step in to help the economy.  The Dow industrials jumped 3.09 per cent to 8635.42.  Broader stock indicators also advanced. The Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 index rose 3.65 per cent to 876.07 and the Nasdaq composite index rose 4.41 per cent to 1509.31.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index contract was up 46 points at 3569 on a volume of 4917 contracts.
