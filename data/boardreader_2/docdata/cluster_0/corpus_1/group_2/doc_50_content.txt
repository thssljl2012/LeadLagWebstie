Bank of Queensland (BOQ) has reaffirmed that full-year earnings will grow ten per cent and says it has no exposure to Lehman Brothers, American International Group (AIG) or Merrill Lynch. 'Our financial year ended on 31 August and we fully expect to hit our guidance to the market of ten per cent normalised cash earnings-per-share (EPS) growth,' BOQ managing director David Liddy said in a statement.BOQ reported in April that first-half normalised cash earnings per share (EPS) rose ten per cent to 43.4 cents. Net profit rose 19 per cent to $57.8 million for the half year to February 29, 2008.Mr Liddy said the Bank had recently succeeded in raising $309.5 million through a 2.5 year syndicated loan which had wide support from Asian and European institutions.BOQ said AIG Australia was an underwriter of a number of insurance policies held by the Bank.But it had no exposure to the US-based parent company, which was taken over by the US Federal Reserve this week to prevent a 'disorderly failure' of AIG. BOQ also said it had no exposure to Lehman, which filed for bankruptcy on September 15, or to Merrill Lynch, which agreed to a takeover by Bank of America.The bank has no exposure to any troubled Gold Coast-based property development groups.Shares in Gold Coast-based developer Raptis Group Ltd are suspended from trading currently while the group seeks a funding injection.Shares in BOQ fell 54 cents, or four per cent, to $12.96 as of 1109 AEST Thursday as financial shares were dumped by investors on concerns more financial companies will be hit by the market turmoil.At 1117 AEST, the ASX 200 Financials index was down 4.35 per cent.
