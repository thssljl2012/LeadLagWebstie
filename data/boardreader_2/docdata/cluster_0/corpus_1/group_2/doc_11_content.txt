ABN Amro Morgans private client adviser Trent Muller said the local market started positively today but turned south in the afternoon, led by futures trading. 'There's a bit of nervousness about how the US market will treat the AIG rescue. AIG is a Dow (Dow Jones Industrial Average index) component,' Mr Muller said. 'It will most certainly be down tonight as a result of the dilution of shareholders' equity and that will potentially offset some upside on other financials.' He said investors were also asking themselves which company would be next to find itself in trouble. 'Most people are still very defensive in their investment policies these days, and they're waiting for a clear sign that we're reaching the bottom.' The US Federal Reserve today announced it would provide AIG with an $US85 billion ($A107.08 billion) rescue loan to save it from bankruptcy amid fears of a catastrophic meltdown of financial markets.
