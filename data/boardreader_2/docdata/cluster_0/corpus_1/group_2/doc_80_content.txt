LONDON: European markets were fighting back on Wednesday in hugely volatile trade, picking up from Asia as investors digested the unprecedented bailout of US insurance giant AIG and the likely rescue of Britain's HBOS bank. Dealers said the US government's decision overnight to take over AIG, for fear its collapse would spark even more turmoil, reassured investors somewhat but the emphasis was on safety first as the credit crunch claimed more victims. Global stock markets were left reeling after US investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on Monday, sparking near panic that more companies would have to be rescued. HBOS, Britain's biggest home loan provider, announced on Wednesday that it was in advanced talks that could lead to an offer from rival Lloyds TSB. After a rollercoaster ride earlier in the week, HBOS shares fell 4.95 per cent to 173 pence while Lloyds TSB jumped 10.01 per cent to 307.75 pence. "The overnight bailout of the US insurer AIG has reassured markets that some financial institutions are too big to be allowed to fail after all," said Capital Economics analyst Julian Jessop. London's FTSE 100 index of leading shares was up 0.59 per cent to 5,055.20 points in mid-afternoon trade, while Frankfurt clawed back 0.02 per cent and Paris was up 0.73 per cent. Investors were eagerly awaiting the reopening of Wall Street at 1330 GMT. In Asia, an equities rally ran out of steam and some markets turned sharply lower on persistent worries over the health of US financial institutions. Hong Kong closed down 3.6 per cent while Shanghai lost 2.9 per cent on concerns over the impact of the US financial turmoil on the Chinese economy. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei-225 index closed up 1.21 per cent, recovering some lost ground.
