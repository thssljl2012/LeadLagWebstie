Bondswere standing tall by noon on Wednesday as the improved rand and some easing of the global and local equities pressure aided institutional and fund management sentiment to an extent.A dealer noted, though, that there was still plenty of uncertainty as to how events would unfold and exactly where the rand was headed next.By 12.16am the short-term government R153 bond was at 9.750% from its close of 9.770%. The medium-term R157 was at 9.010% from 9.080% before and the long-term R186 was bid at 8.700% from Tuesday's close of 8.765%.The rand was last at R8.1219/$ from a previous R8.1294/$.'The currency has come back again and it is nice to see some equity indices in the green. The currency was at 8.25 last night and is now stronger, so bonds strengthened on the back of that with some institutional and fund buying,' said a senior bond dealer.'However, after the earlier buying things have slowed down a bit. We will continue to watch the currency,' he said.The dealer added that while the AIG action was 'quite positive around the world', some investors were asking how many 'bullets' the Federal Reserve had left.Dow Jones Newswires reported that the dollar is lower in Europe on Wednesday as the rollercoaster ride in the financial sector rages on.The dollar edged lower against the euro after the Federal Reserve's rescue of troubled US insurance giant AIG injected a fresh burst of appetite for risk into the market.The Fed also surprised investors somewhat by keeping rates on hold at 2%, but indication that the Fed would be willing to step in if conditions worsened helped ease disappointment.Analysts, however, don't expect this new-found optimism to last.'It would be a brave investor who believes the marginal improvement in risk appetite overnight is the beginning of a longer trend, especially with the money markets still gummed up,' said Daragh Maher, deputy head of global foreign exchange strategy at Calyon in London.'Instead, the conflicting forces of bad US financial sector news and resultant repatriation flows will likely keep the US dollar around current levels,' Maher said.Indeed, sentiment took a sharp hit on renewed fears of the health of the UK's largest mortgage lender HBOS (HBOS.LN), whose shares plummeted, wiping out sterling's earlier gains against the dollar.The pound also fell sharply against the euro on these concerns.HBOS shares soon staged a recovery, however, on news reports of a possible merger with UK bank Lloyds TSB (LYG).Foreigners were net buyers of R215.944-million worth of South African bonds on Tuesday after net sales of R2.202-billion worth of local bonds on Monday, Bond Exchange of South Africa statistics show.Nominal cumulative volume was R185.858-billion on Tuesday from R48.985-billion on Monday.
