LONDON (MarketWatch) -- European shares dropped to a level not seen since 2005 on Tuesday, after ratings downgrades threatened the survival of U.S. insurance giant AIG, Goldman Sachs revealed a sharp drop in third-quarter earnings and funding worries sliced another 30% from the value of U.K. mortgage bank HBOS. The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index (ST:SXXP: news, chart, profile) dropped 3.5% to 261.30 - a three-year low for the index -- with banks performing poorly again. Shares of Britain's top mortgage lender, HBOS (UK:HBOS: news, chart, profile) , dropped 31.3% as investors fretted about the company's ability to fund its lending.  UBS (UBS:UBSNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) , the Swiss giant that's had to take the largest write-offs of any European bank, fell 19.9% and Royal Bank of Scotland (UK:RBS: news, chart, profile) shed 11%. 'At the moment, every dollar of profit that financials make is going to providing a buffer against the possibility that tomorrow a particular financial institution may find itself in the crosshairs of market sentiment,' noted John Haynes, senior equity strategist at Rensburg Sheppards. The U.K. FTSE 100 index (UK:UKX: news, chart, profile) also fell to a three-year low and was last down 3.8% at 5,005.50, while the German DAX 30 index (DX:1876534: news, chart, profile) fell 2.6% to 5,906.05 and the French CAC-40 index (FR:1804546: news, chart, profile) fell 2.6% to 4,060.79. The Russian RTS index slumped 10.5% to 1,453.26, hurt by a big drop in oil prices. Markets globally were focusing on the move by Moody's Investors Services and Standard &amp;amp; Poor's to downgrade their ratings on American International Group (AIG:AIGNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) , a move that could threaten its survival. AIG lost more than 60% of its market value on Monday and shares looked set to drop again on Tuesday.  U.S. stock futures were also pointing to another slide on Tuesday, after Goldman Sachs (GS:GSNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) reported a 71% drop in third-quarter profit and the Commerce Department reported the first drop in consumer prices since October 2006. See Indications. The Federal Reserve meets Tuesday to make a decision in interest rates. A month ago, the Fed signaled strongly that its next move would be to raise interest rates, not cut them. But that was before the seizure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, before the extraordinary collapse of Lehman Bros. early Monday, and before the weekend fire sale of Merrill Lynch.  'The market is hoping that maybe with the Federal Reserve meeting today there might be a 25 to 50 basis point interest rate cut. Futures are discounting a 70% chance that there will be a 25 basis point rate cut,' said Philippe Gijsels, senior strategist at Fortis Bank. Assessing Lehman exposure Beleaguered European financials were also attempting to detail their exposure to Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy. (LEH:LEHNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) . French bank Natixis (FR:012068: news, chart, profile) , down 15.8%, said late Monday that it has a net risk of Lehman's signature of 21 million euros, 34 million euros of mark-to-market exposure, 40 million euros of counter-guarantee exposure and 14 million euros of counterparty risks. Santander (STD:STDNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) shares fell 3.8%. It said that it has direct exposure of 11 million euros to Lehman Brothers. It also has a 44.6 million euros position in Lehman derivatives. Shares in insurer Aegon (AEG:AEGNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) (NL:30370: news, chart, profile) fell 7% after it said it has around 265 million euros ($376 million) of fixed income exposure to Lehman Brothers but doesn't hold any common equity in the failed firm. Aegon said the ultimate effect of a default by Lehman on its capital and net income will be substantially lower than 265 million euros due to taxes and recovery values. The insurer said it continues to have a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity. In another twist to the Lehman saga, shares in U.K. bank Barclays (BCS:BCSNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst Create alertInsiderDiscussFinancials Sponsored by:, , ) (UK:BARC: news, chart, profile) fell 5.5% after it said that it is in talks with Lehman Brothers to buy certain assets 'on terms that would be attractive to Barclays shareholders.' See story. Barclays said on Monday that it had ended talks to buy the entire firm. Oil down Light sweet crude futures fell another $3.89 to $91.89 a barrel, pressuring energy firms such as Eni (IT:ENI: news, chart, profile) , down 3.3%.

VW shares rose 2%, one of just five advancers in the DAX 30. Sarah Turner is a markets reporter for MarketWatch in London.
