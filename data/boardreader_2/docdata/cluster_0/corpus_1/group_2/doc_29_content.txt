Repercussions from the collapse of Lehman Brothers yesterday have been felt throughout markets around the world. The S&amp;amp;P closed 4.71% down at 1192.7, while the Dow Jones index lost 4.42% and the Nasdaq closed 3.6% down at 2179.91. Speculation that insurance giant AIG could be the next to go under contributed to stock market woes. AIG saw its debt downgraded by the ratings agencies, which affected European markets, notably insurers. The DJ Stoxx 50 opened 2.05% down while the FTSE EuroFirst 300 recovered some of the ground lost after Monday's announcement, falling 1.75% today after its 3.6% slide yesterday. Asian markets that had been closed for a public holiday yesterday saw shares hit by 5% falls in a rebound from US financials. The FTSE 100's top losers this morning include HBOS, Barclays and RBS, dragging the index down to open at 5126.5, a 1.49% drop. HBOS lost 7.2% in early trading as its share price slipped to 215.75. Meanwhile the price of brent crude oil fell to $91.95 a barrel this morning, further compounding concerns the credit crunch is set to do more damage to the global economy.
