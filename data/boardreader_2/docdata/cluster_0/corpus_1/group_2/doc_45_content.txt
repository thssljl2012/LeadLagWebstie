HONG KONG -- Asian stocks ended mixed Wednesday following an early rally that was led by confidence after the U.S. Federal Reserve bailed out troubled American Insurance Group (AIG).A day after the region's indices plummeted following the collapse of Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers, Seoul and Tokyo reversed some of their losses but Hong Kong fell to its lowest level in almost two years. Markets opened favorably to gains on Wall Street on Tuesday, which had reacted after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would extend an 85-billion-dollar loan to AIG. The move will give the U.S. government a nearly 80 percent stake in the insurer. Investors were also cautious after the Fed Tuesday held its base lending rate at 2.0 percent, saying the economy was likely to achieve 'moderate' growth over time despite the financial turmoil, dealers said. They had been expecting a quarter point cut. However, the rally failed to keep the momentum and shares began to fall back again. Hong Kong, which had opened 2.1 percent higher, fell back and closed 3.6 percent down, beneath 18,000 points and at its lowest level since October 4, 2006.Singapore also ended near a two-year low, despite a promising opening to the day. Worries of a possible technical recession hitting Singapore were triggered after key exports tumbled 14.0 percent in August from a year ago.Tokyo rallied at the beginning of the day, opening up two percent before settling down to close the day 1.21 percent better off. The gains came as the central Bank of Japan announced it had pumped 5.5 trillion yen (51.6 billion dollars) into the money markets since Tuesday.Seoul, which had tanked 6.1 percent Tuesday, regained some ground and closed almost three percent higher, while the won also made significant gains against the dollar after losing out massively the day before.TOKYO: Japanese share prices closed up 1.21 percent, dealers said. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's benchmark Nikkei-225 index closed up 140.07 points at 11,749.79. The Nikkei paired early gains, ending the morning session up more than two percent.HONG KONG: Shares closed down 3.6 percent, dealers said. The benchmark index plunged 663.42 points to 17,637.19 on turnover was HK$76.23 billion (US$9.77 billion).SYDNEY: Australian shares lost 0.6 percent, dealers said. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 lost 28.6 points to 4,722.2, while the broader All Ordinaries fell 30.1 points to 4,769.7.A total of 1.52 billion shares worth A$6.96 billion (US$5.57 billion) was traded, with 614 stocks down, 420 up and 314 unchanged.
