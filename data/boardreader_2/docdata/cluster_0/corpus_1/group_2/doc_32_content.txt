US stocks are tipped to open lower as investors digest the rescue of insurance giant AIG and another grim set of housing data.Futures are pointing to a fall of more than 120 points for the Dow, with Nasdaq and the S&amp;amp;P predicted to open down about 16 points apiece.Traders say markets remain unimpressed with the action taking so far to shore up financial markets and expect more problems before any line can be drawn under the current crisis. The Fed announced last night it would inject $85bn into AIG to keep it afloat.Any relief that AIG has been saved is likely to be tempered by The Commerce Department's latest housing figures. They showed both building permits and housing starts declined in August by more than expected. Building permits fell to an annual rate of 854,000 in August and housing starts declined to 895,000.Oil prices rebounded by more than $3 to $94 per barrel as traders took heart from the AIG rescue.
