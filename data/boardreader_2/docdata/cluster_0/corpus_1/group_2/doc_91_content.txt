US shares plunged today after the Federal Reserve's massive bailout of insurance giant AIG failed to calm a financial market storm and investors rushed for safe haven assets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 451.88 points (4.09 per cent) to 10,607.14 at the closing bell in the second massive loss in three sessions. The Nasdaq composite nose-dived 109.05 points (4.94 per cent) to 2098.85 and the broad-market Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 index lost 57.57 points to a preliminary close at 1156.03.The market action came after the US Federal Reserve agreed to a loan of up to $US85 billion ($107.08 billion) to stave off collapse at Amercian International Group to help limit financial market contagion. But Aaron Smith at Economy.com said market nerves were not calmed. 'Widespread market disruptions continue,' he said, citing a massive flow into oil, gold and short-term Treasury bills. 'This is evident in an unprecedented flight to quality. Investor concern is also growing about the Fed's ability to support markets in the future as the central bank's own balance sheet is reduced.'
