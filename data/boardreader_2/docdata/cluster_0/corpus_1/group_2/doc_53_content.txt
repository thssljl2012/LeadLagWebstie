LONDON (ShareCast) - The US government's bailout of insurance behemoth AIG caused another massive sell-off Wednesday sending Wall Street crashing to its lowest since 2005. Investment banks were the biggest casualties, with Morgan Stanley losing a quarter of its value and Goldman Sachs a fifth. JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America also felt the pain. The Federal Reserve's decision to take an 80% stake in American International Group (AIG) in return for an $85bn loan from the government had investors wondering who else will need rescuing, seriously diluting private shareholdings. AIG still lost half its value midweek despite guaranteeing its survival, surpassed only by Lehman Brothers, down 53% at the closing bell. The insurer will have to sell off assets to repay the loan. Meanwhile the latest housing figures offered no solace for DIY retailer Home Depot. Building permits fell to a lower than expected annual rate of 854,000 in August and housing starts declined to 895,000, also worse than forecast. Across the markets, the Dow Jones plunged 449 points to 10,609, its second worst fall this year, the tech-laced Nasdaq Composite closed 109 points, or 5% lower, at 2,098, while the broader S&amp;amp;P 500 ended the session off 57 at 1,156. Oil prices rose to more than $6 to over $97 a barrel as the weaker US currency made dollar denominated assets cheaper for foreign investors. But this hit the share price of car-maker General Motors and plane-maker Boeing. In corporate news, higher sales could not prevent Cheerios cereal maker General Mills reporting a fall in profits as higher commodity costs took their toll. Revenue in the quarter to August 24 rose by 14% to $3.5bn, the Minneapolis, Minnesota-based company said, but earnings per share (EPS) slipped to 79 cents from 81 cents. On the bright side, the much rumoured bid from Samsung for Sandisk finally materialised, pushing the share price of the memory card maker sharply higher.
