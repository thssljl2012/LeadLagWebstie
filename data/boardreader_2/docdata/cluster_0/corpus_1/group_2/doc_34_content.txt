Australian stocks were weaker at noon after US shares went into freefall overnight following New York investment bank Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy, the firesale of Merrill Lynch and continuing rumours about the stability of American Insurance Group.At 1200 AEST, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 was 112 points lower, or 2.32 per cent to 4705.7, while the broader All Ordinaries lost 119.3 points, or 2.45 per cent, to 4755.7.The September share price index futures contract was down 129 points to 4698, on a volume of 68,262 contracts.Investors ran for cover after the emergency sale of Wall Street stalwart Merrill Lynch to Bank of America for $US50 billion ($A61 billion) in stock and Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after failing to find a buyer during a weekend of crisis talks.Commonwealth Bank of Australia says it has exposure to the collapsed New York investment bank Lehman Brothers amounting to no more that $150 million.Lehman Brothers' filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission listed ANZ Banking Group as having $85.3 million in exposures via two bank loans worth $US44 million ($A54.4 million) and $US25 million ($A30.9 million), and National Australia Bank with exposures of $28.3 million via two letters of credit worth $US12.5 million ($A15.5 million) and $US10.2 million ($A12.7 million).Westpac says its exposure to Lehman Brothers is less than $A10 million.Aequs Securities Institutional dealer, Ric Klusman, said that, despite the market chaos, the Australian exchange could be a lot worse. 'We're doing pretty well really,' Mr Klusman said. 'Don't forget that we have fallen close to ten per cent in the last week, so we've already built a lot of this in. 'We were down 80 points yesterday, 50 points the day before that, 200 points the day before that,' he said. Commonwealth Bank fell $1.04, or 2.48 per cent to $40.94, NAB lost $1.06, or 4.65 per cent, to $21.76, while ANZ dropped 95 cents, or 5.63 per cent to $15.92.Westpac lost 52 cents, or 2.25 per cent, to $22.63 and its takeover target St George Bank sank 93 cents, or 3.07 per cent, to $29.41.Macquarie Group fell $2.85, or 7.22 per cent, to $36.61, while Babcock &amp;amp; Brown lost 70 cents, or 44.3 per cent, to 88 cents.Overnight, the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled below 11,000 with a loss of 504.48 points, or 4.42 per cent, to 10,917.51, its largest point loss since reopening after the September 2001 terrorist attacks.The Nasdaq composite plummeted 81.36 points, or 3.6 per cent, to 2,179.91 and the broad-market Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 index lost 59 points, or 4.71 per cent, to 1,192.70.Shares in struggling US insurance giant American International Group plunged 61 per cent as investors feared that a life-line from New York authorities, who said the company could borrow some $US20 billion ($A24.41 billion) from its subsidiaries, won't be enough to save the company. 'The big risk to our market is obviously not so much the Lehman's or Merill's deal, which is well known now, it's whether AIG fails, and if AIG fails, it's the world's largest insurance company and everybody has exposure one way or another,' Mr Klusman said. The big miners were relatively stable.BHP Billiton dropped 25 cents, or 0.69 per cent, to $35.80, while takeover target Rio Tinto was down $1.29, or 1.21 per cent, to $105.14.Rio, the world's second largest iron ore producer, has resumed full operations at its Cape Lambert port in Western Australia after a rail car dumper sustained damage.Energy producers declined after crude oil prices fell amid global market jitters stoked concerns about the health of the US economy.New York's main contract, light sweet crude for October, plummeted $US5.47 to close at $US95.71 a barrel.Woodside Petroleum fell $1.94, or 3.73 per cent to $50.06, Oil Search slumped 35 cents, or 5.88 per cent to $5.60 and Santos dropped 89 cents, or 4.73 per cent to $17.91.  2008 AAP Brought to you by
