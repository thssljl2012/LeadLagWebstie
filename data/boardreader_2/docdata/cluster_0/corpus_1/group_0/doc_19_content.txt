 cheered by better than expected U.S. economic data but wary, eyeing a sudden bounceback in oil prices. Shares in mainland China did the best by far, as investors took their cue from the People's Bank of China, which did not indicate further monetary tightening in the statement it released Friday. And stocks in Australia were decidedly the worst performers, depressed by a profit warning from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. The S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index in Australia tumbled by 1.0%, to 4,922.10, Monday, in reaction to Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (other-otc: ANZBY - news - people ) saying it would need to write down more than $1 billion in the second half as a result of ongoing problems with bad debt. (See 'ANZ Crunched') Shares of ANZ Banking Group plummeted by 10.9%, to 15.81 Australian dollars ($15.12), in Monday trading, after the bank said its profit in 2008 would be down 20%-25%, owing to higher provisions for loan losses.In Hong Kong, share prices were modestly firmer early in the day but reversed direction upon the news from ANZ Banking Group, which deflated bank shares. The benchmark Hang Seng index edged off by 0.2%, to 22,687.21.

The H-shares of China Telecom rose 0.95%, to 4.27 Hong Kong dollars (55 cents), while China Unicom H-shares increased by 1.0%, to 15.48 Hong Kong dollars ($1.98).Investors, however, were unsettled by the sight of oil prices suddenly picking up. Light, sweet crude for September delivery rose $1.37, to $124.63 a barrel, rebounding from a seven-week low, during Monday Asian trading hours. The benchmark contract had fallen $2.23 on Friday, to settle at $123.26, after falling as low as $122.50, the lowest since June 5.Japanese stocks started the week marginally higher, following a back-and-forth trading day. In the early going, trading was stimulated by Friday's pickup in the Dow, which rose 0.2%, to 11,370.69, after the U.S. Commerce Department announced that durable goods orders for manufactures such as cars, appliances and machinery rose 0.8% in June, the biggest gain in four months. Another report, which showed that new home sales declined by a smaller than expected 0.6%, also pleased U.S. investors and their Asian counterparts. But caution about upcoming earnings reports from some major electronics firms as well as further U.S. economic data resulted in those early gains largely dissipating.The Nikkei 225 finished Monday up 0.1%, at 13,353.78, off a high of 13,468.94.
