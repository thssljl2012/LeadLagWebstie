 ANZ Australia Total Job Ads Fall 3.0% In June Vs May SYDNEY (Dow Jones)--The total number of job advertisements in Australia fell 3.0% in seasonally adjusted terms in June from the previous month, to an average of 262,705 ads per week, contributing to a 6.2% annual rise, Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., which compiles the data from major newspapers, said Monday. The number of Internet job advertisements fell 2.9% in June from May, contributing to an annual increase of 8.3% in seasonally adjusted terms. The number of newspaper job advertisements fell 3.5% in June from May, contributing to a 17.9% annual fall in seasonally adjusted terms. ANZ co-head of Australian Economics Sally Auld said employment advertising fell in absolute terms but it is unlikely to signal a sustained downturn in employment. 'The risk may be that persistent skill shortages could encourage firms to hoard labor. This should ensure that while labor market conditions soften, the slowdown in employment growth and the rise in the unemployment rate will be reasonably measured,' she said. Job ads are considered an indicator of current business activity and employment trends. The trend series, which further smoothes the data, fell 0.6% in June from May and rose 9.4% on year, ANZ Bank said. -By James Glynn; Dow Jones Newswires; 612-8235-2955; james.glynn@dowjones.com Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http://www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=zWzWhyv77fAzXNFP%2BpXClA%3D%3D.
