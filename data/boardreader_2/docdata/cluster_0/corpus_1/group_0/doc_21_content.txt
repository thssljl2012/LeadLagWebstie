 * Shares rise as oil's drop lifts sentiment * Resources stocks fall on weaker commodity prices (Adds details, comments)SYDNEY, July 23 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose 1.1 percent on Wednesday, as a drop in oil prices bolstered investor sentiment, lifting banks and consumer-related firms, though weaker commodity prices pressured the resources sector.Sentiment in the banking sector has also improved after a raft of stronger-than-expected earnings at big U.S. banks.Analysts said the fall in oil had helped soothe worries about the impact of rising fuel costs on company profits and economic growth, but sentiment was still fragile and a further spike in energy prices would trigger a fresh wave of selling.'You've got the oil prices coming off and the economy is looking slightly less stressed,' said Greg Goodsell, equity strategist at ABN AMRO.'But for these sorts of rallies to be sustained, we'll need the oil price to stabilise and for confidence to return we need losses at various financial institutions to stop flowing out so freely.'The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index .AXJO rose 56.8 points to 5,062.4 by 0054 GMT, after edging down 0.1 percent in the previous session.New Zealand's benchmark NZX-50 index .NZ50 rose 1.8 percent, or 55.89 points, to 3,199.79.
