 CANBERRA -(Dow Jones)- Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said Monday that expected losses on certain assets forecast by Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) are a result of poor investment decisions by the bank.Australia's fourth largest bank by market capitalization earlier Monday said it expects credit provisions in the second half will be around A$1.2 billion, up from A$980 million in the first half, as the deterioration in global credit markets continues. 'I think it is a very sensible thing for the ANZ this morning to make provision for these potential losses. These potential losses come from poor investment decisions taken over a period of years, as well as the fallout from the global financial market events,' Swan told reporters in Canberra.He said the ANZ announcement shows Australia is 'not immune' from global financial market issues.ANZ's writedowns follow rival National Australia Bank Ltd.'s (NAB) warning Friday that it will take a further A$830 million provision against its investments in U.S. residential mortgages. That prompted fellow banks  (WBK) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd. (CBA.AU) to clarify their exposure to residential mortgage-backed securities.Swan said Monday that the country's banking regulators are satisfied that Australian banks have made full disclosure of losses relating to the ongoing credit crisis. -By Rachel Pannett, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-6208-0901; rachel.pannett@ dowjones.com Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http:// www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=8ro1ps7j8xw5pBCRgA4Huw%3D%3D.
