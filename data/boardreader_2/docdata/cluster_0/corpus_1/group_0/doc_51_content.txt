 MELBOURNE, July 29 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB.AX: Quote, Profile, Research) is continuing to perform well in difficult conditions, the head of the bank's Australian operations said on Tuesday.NAB, Australia's biggest bank by assets, booked A$830 million ($795 million) in provisions last week against potential losses on its exposure to U.S. mortgages, sending its share price tumbling. 'While we certainly see some difficulties in some markets, particularly confidence -- people's confidence -- is decreasing, the underlying performance of our business is very good,' NAB Executive director and Executive Australia, Ahmed Fahour said on the sidelines of a grains conference Tuesday.Australia's banks had previously been seen as largely unaffected by global credit ructions, but sentiment took another battering on Monday when Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) (ANZ.AX: Quote, Profile, Research) warned that its profits would fall sharply and forecast more than A$1 billion in bad debt charges.Like NAB, ANZ made a point of reassuring the market that its underlying business was performing well, particularly its personal banking and Asia businesses, in spite of tougher market conditions.NAB shares were down 2.2 percent at A$25.23 at 0059 GMT, compared with a 0.9 percent fall in the wider market . ANZ was down 0.3 percent at A$15.76 while Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX: Quote, Profile, Research) was down 3.6 percent at A$39.61 and Westpac Banking Corp (WBC.AX: Quote, Profile, Research) fell 2.4 percent to A$19.85.NAB has also refunded hundreds of millions of dollars to disgruntled investors who bought into a bond sale just days before it announced a surprise writedown.NAB has refunded a large part of an A$850 million ($814.2 million) bond issue sold early last week, a market source said on Tuesday (see [nSYD210373]).
