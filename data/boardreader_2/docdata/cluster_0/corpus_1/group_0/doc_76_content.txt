 snapping a three-day losing streak. Wall Street's rebound overnight on the back of upbeat U.S. consumer confidence data and a drop in crude oil prices encouraged investors to buy banking stocks, which were hit by credit concerns over the previous few sessions. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index closed up 89.3 points or 1.8% at 4,936 and the broader All Ordinaries index gained 85.4 points or 1.7% to finish at 5,008.7.On the economic front, new home approvals unexpectedly fell in June on high interest rates and rising building costs. The seasonally adjusted estimate for total dwelling units approved fell 0.7% in the previous month to 12,237 units, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday, following a revised fall of 7.2% in May and was worse than the expectations for a 1.0% increase. On an annual basis, building permits were down 7.8% after a revised fall of 0.4% in May. Analysts had been looking for a decline of 4.1%.The Australian dollar fell to a six-week low, hurt by speculation that domestic interest rates could be cut as early as this year and by softer commodity prices.
