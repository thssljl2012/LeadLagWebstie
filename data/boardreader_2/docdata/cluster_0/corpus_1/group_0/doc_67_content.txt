 SYDNEY, Australia-Shares in Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Australia's fourth-largest bank, plunged more than 10 percent Monday after the bank announced that its annual profit could fall by up to 25 percent due to the global credit crisis.While affirming that its underlying business was strong and its 2008 cash profit would be over 3 billion Australian dollars (US$2.9 billion), ANZ said it expected a A$1.2 billion (US$1.1 billion) provision charge for bad debts and other write-offs.This adds to a A$980 million (US$938 million) provision booked in the first half of they year.The bank said the losses were expected to drive its annual cash earnings per share down by between 20 and 25 percent. 'ANZ's underlying business is continuing to deliver a solid performance, and we expect a cash profit of over $3 billion in 2008,' chief executive Mike Smith said. 'However, we need to recognize where we are at with legacy issues in institutional and the change in the economic cycle. 'As the deterioration in global credit markets continues and the slowing of the global economy plays out in Australia and in New Zealand, there are flow-on effects for our commercial portfolios and to a lesser extent the personal portfolios.' ANZ shares were down 10 percent to A$15.97 in midday trading after earlier dropping as low as A$15.40.Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan said the announcement shows that Australia is not immune to global market turmoil but said the banking sector remained strong. 'I think we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that we do have a strong, well-regulated banking sector which is capable of withstanding the fallout from these international developments,' Swan said. ANZ's announcement comes after banking stocks were dragged down last Friday after National Australia Bank Ltd. announced an A$830 million (US$825 million) loss linked to investments in U.S. mortgage debt.
