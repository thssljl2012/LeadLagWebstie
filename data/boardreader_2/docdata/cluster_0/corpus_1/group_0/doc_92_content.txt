 Inflation figures due out tomorrow could provide the cue for the Reserve Bank to lower interest rates later this month, economists say.Both the market and the Reserve Bank are expecting higher food and petrol prices will drive a 1.4 per cent increase in inflation for the June quarter, taking it to 3.8 per cent for the year, up from 3.4 per cent in the previous quarter.A significant weakening in business confidence during the quarter mean the chances of an interest rate cut this month have grown.If inflation was in line or below expectations it 'may open the door to a July OCR (Official Cash Rate) cut', ASB chief economist Nick Tuffley said. 'But only if the Reserve Bank is confident enough that reduced inflationary pressure from the faltering economy will offset any impact soaring headline inflation has on wage and price-setting behaviour. 'With headline inflation reaching for 5 per cent in the third quarter, any decision will be a close call.' The Reserve Bank indicated last month that it would start reducing the official interest rate, now at 8.25 per cent, before Christmas.However, Westpac says it expects inflation to increase 'by an eyebrow-raising' 1.6 per cent in the June quarter, taking annual inflation to 4 per cent and expects it to jump to 5.5 per cent in the next three months.This would prevent the Reserve Bank from aggressively easing interest rates despite the sharp softening in economic growth, Westpac said.The bank said the headline number would be driven by a 'hefty' 2.2 per cent in foreign-traded goods led by the higher cost of petrol, food and international airfares.Westpac agreed with the consensus view that food and petrol would contribute 1 percentage point to the June quarter, 0.3 per cent for food and 0.7 per cent for petrol.Housing-related inflation was expected to add another 0.2 percentage points, with a 2.5 per cent rise in energy prices and a 1 per cent rise in rents driving most of that increase, ANZ said.Economists said the Reserve Bank's focus was on domestic, or non-tradeable inflation, particularly whether the sharp slowdown in demand was resulting in an easing of inflation pressure.Domestic inflation is expected to increase 1 per cent in the June quarter, down from 1.1 per cent in the March quarter, leaving the annual domestic inflation unchanged at 3.5 per cent.ANZ said heavy discounting by struggling retailers could provide some offset to higher-than-expected service sector costs. 'Given the sharp slowdown in sales and high stock levels in the retail sector, aggressive discounting has been the norm throughout the June quarter,' the ANZ said. 'Judging by some of the advertising by major retailers, we could well see an even bigger price decline for retail-related good in the June quarter than what we saw in the March quarter,' the bank said. However, recent surveys show that businesses are trying to pass on cost increases to customers by lifting prices, in defiance of what the Reserve Bank is trying to achieve.If businesses did raise prices, the annual rate of inflation could exceed 5 per cent by the end of this year, ANZ said.The New Zealand Institute of Economic Research's latest quarterly survey out last week showed the worst business expectations for 26 years about the next three months' trading. Despite the poor outlook, the institute urged the Reserve Bank to hold interest rates because a cut would risk letting the inflation 'genie out of the bottle'. The economy was slowing because of drought, rising fuel and food prices and high interest rates.But the ANZ said the Reserve Bank was already prepared to look through the near-term spike in inflation, forecast to reach 4.7 per cent in the September quarter, and tomorrow's inflation figures should not derail expectations of lower rates this year.The Reserve Bank is charged with keeping inflation between 1 per cent and 3 per cent on average over the medium term.
