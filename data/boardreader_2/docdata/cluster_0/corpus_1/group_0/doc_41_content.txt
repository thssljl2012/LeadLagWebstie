 SYDNEY, July 16 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose 1.1 percent on Wednesday, as the big banks bounced back after recent hefty losses, while retailer Woolworths Ltd (ASX: WOW.ax) gained after it stuck to its full-year outlook.The rate-sensitive banking sector also got a lift after Australia's top central banker said it now looked more likely that domestic demand would slow enough to restrain inflation over time, reinforcing expectations that interest rates had peaked [ID:nSYD52148].Despite the rally, market watchers said the outlook for equities remained clouded by credit-market troubles and a worsening outlook for economic growth and company profits amid high oil prices. 'Certainly the banks are cheap but it just seems like a bit of short-covering at the moment. The financial sector in the U.S. continues to be hammered, credit markets are tight and liquidity is tight,' said Savanth Sebastian, equities economist at CommSec. 'Oil is definitely still a key worry for investors. Demand and supply are pretty much in line at the moment and any sort of disruptions to supply will see a spike in the oil price.'
