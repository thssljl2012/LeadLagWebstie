 (Adds details, comments)SYDNEY, July 14 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 0.5 percent on Monday, with top miner BHP Billiton Ltd (ASX: BHP.ax) and banks leading the decline on uncertainty over the impact of high oil prices and financial sector woes on global economic growth.The U.S. Treasury Department and Federal Reserve on Sunday announced sweeping measures to support embattled mortgage lenders Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N, by lending money and buying equity if necessary [ID:nN13387357].However, market analysts said while the move helped head off further steep declines in equity markets, there was still plenty of cause for concern about the health of financial institutions. 'Cleary, steps to shore up (Fannie and Freddie) are a positive, but the fact that they are having difficulties in the first place is just symptomatic of a difficult environment out there,' said Greg Goodsell, equity strategist at ABN AMRO. 'To restore confidence, we need a period of time where we don't hear any more of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac problems or if oil prices come down. We need a period of stability where people can start getting confident that the worst has passed.'
