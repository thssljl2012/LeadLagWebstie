 Australian shares have fallen 0.2 per cent as growing worries about more credit market losses at domestic banks sparked further selling in Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and other financial firms. But the broader market, led by top miner BHP Billiton Ltd, recovered from the previous session's sell-off, capping losses. ANZ, Australia's third-biggest lender, dropped 10 per cent o $15.97 after it said its provisions in the second half were likely to be around $1.2 billion due to the ongoing deterioration in global credit markets. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index fell 10.4 points to 4,960.1 by 1012 AEST, after falling 3.4 per cent in the previous session.
