 Asian stocks extended losses Tuesday after U.S. equities fell amid persistent credit concerns, with banking stocks such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group leading the decline. Stocks got off to a weak start after the Dow industrials ended at a two-year low as the latest plan by the U.S. government to bail out the nation's two biggest mortgage financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, failed to fully convince investors about its effectiveness. 'Washington's moves to shore up confidence in the mortgage companies didn't give as much comfort to investors as previously thought,' said Kwak Joong-bo, an analyst at Hana Daetoo Securities in Seoul. 'Rather, they seemed to view the efforts as confirmation of the gravity of the troubles in the U.S. financial sector.' More time is needed for the market to recover and short-term investors would be better off if they take a conservative stance, said Kwak. 'What investors can do for the moment is just hope that key U.S. investment banks would not deliver earnings shocks.' Wells Fargo &amp;amp; Co. on Wednesday and JPMorgan Chase &amp;amp; Co. on Thursday are expected to report profit declines. Citigroup Inc. -- the nation's largest bank by assets -- is expected to post its third straight quarterly loss. The Nikkei 225 index fell 2 percent to 12,749.98 and the Topix slipped 2.1 percent to 1,253.99. A Nikkei newspaper report that Japan's three megabanks had some 4.7 trillion yen ($44.2 billion) in debt securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as of March 31 added to the gloom. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial lost 4 percent to 939 yen, Mizuho Financial Group Ltd fell 3.5 percent to to 519,000 yen and Mitsui Sumitomo Financial Group lost 3.6 percent to 805,000 yen. In South Korea, Kookmin Bank fell 2.8 percent to 56,400 won and Shinhan Financial Group dipped 4 percent to 43,200 won sending the Kospi down 2.9 percent at 1,514.10. The S&amp;amp;P/ASX was down 2.2 percent at 4,814.40 and All Ordinaries down 2 percent at 4,906.9 with Commonwealth Bank down 3.6 percent at A$38.71, National Australia Bank losing 3.1 percent to A$25.66, and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group off 2.9 percent at A$17.29. The Hang Seng index gave up 3.2 percent at 21,303.44 and the Shanghai composite index was down 2.5 percent at 2,805.92. 'Sentiment on banking stocks is sour. Investors are worried that Chinese banks have investments in the two U.S. mortgage lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,' said Yu Kei Lee, analyst at Core Pacific-Yamaichi in Hong Kong. Concerns about investments in assets linked to the subprime mortgage market in the U.S. resurfaced this month after Lehman Brothers said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would need additional capital.
