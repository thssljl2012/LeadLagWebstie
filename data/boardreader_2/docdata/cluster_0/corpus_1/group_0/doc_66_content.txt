 Sydney July 7 (Reuters) - Job advertisements in Australian newspapers and on the Internet fell sharply June, pointing to a softening in the drum-tight labour market, a survey showed on Monday, further easing the pressure for more interest rate hikes.The total number of job advertisements fell 3 percent in June to an average 262,705 a week, extending a 1.7 percent decline in May. Ads were 6.2 percent higher than in June last year, according to the survey from ANZ Bank.The ANZ survey showed the number of job advertisements in major metropolitan newspapers dropped 3.5 percent in June to an average of 16,593 per week. That followed a 13.5 percent decline in May -- the biggest fall in eight years.Internet job advertisements fell 2.9 percent in June to an average 246,112 per week. That was 11.7 percent up on the same month of 2007. 'While employment growth should ease modestly over the next six months, we do not expect a significant slowing in labour market activity,' said Sally Auld, co-head of Australian economics at ANZ. 'Indeed, the risk may be that persistent skill shortages could encourage firms to hoard labour.' Australia's labour market remains tight, with the jobless rate still near three-decade lows at 4.3 percent, but has been showing tentative signs of moderation.The central bank said last week that signs of a softening labour market, along with subdued consumer demand, had allowed it to keep its overnight cash rate on hold at 7.25 percent after its policy meeting, despite stubbornly high inflation pressures.The government's monthly employment report on Thursday is expected to show that employers returned to hiring in June, after posting the first net decline in jobs in 19 months in May, with a median forecast for the economy to have added a net 10,000 jobs.Some analysts suspect the bounce could be big enough to rekindle the risk of higher rates, although a further decline in June could see the market further discount the risk of another rate hike.(Reporting by Anirban Nag) - bhxInteractive Investor brings you breaking news throughout the day to support your investment decisions.
