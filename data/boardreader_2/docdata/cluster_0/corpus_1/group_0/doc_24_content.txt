 (Adds details, comments)SYDNEY, July 11 (Reuters) - Australian shares edged up 0.2 percent on Friday as stronger oil and metals prices lifted resource firms such as BHP Billiton Ltd (ASX: BHP.ax) , though worries about further credit-related losses weighed down on the financials.The benchmark index .AXJO was set to post its eighth straight weekely loss, the longest such losing streak since July 2002.Market watchers said while a jump in oil prices back above $141 a barrel CLc1 provided a good lift to the resource sector, it has raised fresh concerns about rising inflation, sluggish economic growth and slowing company profits.
