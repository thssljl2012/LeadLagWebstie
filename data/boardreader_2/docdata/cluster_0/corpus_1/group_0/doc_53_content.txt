 SYDNEY, July 8 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 1.4 percent to a near two-year low on Tuesday, with financial firms such as Macquarie Group MGQ.AX hit by credit concerns, while property shares fell for a second day on a bleak earnings outlook.The benchmark index .AXJO has now lost 22.2 percent so far this year, after an 11.8 percent rise in 2007, and has slumped 28 percent since hitting a lifetime high last November.Market watchers said while the index could be due for a bounce soon, it would be hard to see any sustained gains as rising inflation continues to threaten the outlook for company earnings. 'There's going to be a lot of earnings downgrades,' said Neale Goldston-Morris, head of equity strategy at Macquarie Equities. 'The big problem is inflation because the higher the inflation, the lower the earnings multiples need to be for the market.' Other analysts shared his downbeat view, noting a series of global issues that could cast a shadow on the Australian market. 'Now people are reassessing the fact that their assessment of the credit crunch being over was incorrect, that the U.S. economy is indeed very likely to go into a recession and that China might not be able to support the high commodity prices on its own,' said Adnan Kucukalic, equity strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.Australia's benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index .AXJO fell 69.6 points to 4,932.9, based on the latest available data, its lowest level since Aug. 15, 2006 and adding to a 1.6 percent fall in the previous session.New Zealand's benchmark NZX-50 index .NZ50 rose 1.25 percent, or 39.14 points, to 3,160.59.
