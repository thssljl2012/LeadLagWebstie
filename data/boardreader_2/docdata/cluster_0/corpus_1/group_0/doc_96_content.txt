 The Federal Opposition says the Prime Minister must demand an explanation from the banks over their latest interest rate hikes.The Commonwealth Bank and the ANZ today both increased their standard variable home loan rates, independent of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).ANZ has announced it is increasing its standard variable home loan rate by 0.15 per cent to 9.62 per cent.That is slightly higher than the 0.14 per cent rise announced by the Commonwealth Bank earlier today, taking its rate to 9.58 per cent.Opposition Leader Brendan Nelson says the Government should step in. 'The banks are increasing their interest rates under Mr Rudd, but I don't remember them doing that under Mr Costello,' he said. 'The most important thing is the banks have got to explain to Australians - and Mr Rudd's got to put the blowtorch on them to do this - explain to Australians why with such huge profits are they further increasing interest rates.' Smaller lenders St George and Bankwest announced bigger rate rises of 0.2 of a per cent in the last week.The National Australia Bank and Westpac say their rates are always under review, but they have no immediate plans to lift them.But Patersons Securities banking analyst Mark Topy says they are likely to move with the credit crisis set to persist. 'This is a difficult issue and I suppose it is the one that everyone's trying to answer at the moment, my own view is that we have some way to go,' he said. 'There's some of the issues in terms of the slowing economy [that] can be self-fulfilling if the US economy falls further and that's my expectation that it will lead to corporate default.' Mr Topy says hopes the credit crisis were easing have been dashed. 'We seem to have had a false dawn - there was an improvement and a more confident feeling in the air that some of the bad news was behind us, but then there was a next wave of issues coming out in the US banking sector and obviously with equity markets' performance, that has cast the gloom again on financial markets,' Mr Topy said.
