 SYDNEY, July 9 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose 1 percent on Wednesday as comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve helped to calm credit market worries, lifting financial firms such as National Australia Bank Ltd . A steep fall in oil prices soothed concerns about consumer spending, further lifting sentiment, though the fall weighed down on energy firms such as Woodside Petroleum Ltd . Financials were among the biggest gainers, tracking their U.S. peers higher, after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. central bank may extend emergency lending facilities for big Wall Street banks past year-end [ID:nN08193843]. However, despite the rise on the Australian market, analysts said it would be difficult to pinpoint a bottom for the benchmark index , given the threat of rising inflation, sluggish economic growth and slowing company profits. 'It remains to seen whether this rush of blood can be sustained,' said Hans Kunnen, head of investment markets research at Colonial First State. 'Earnings growth is likely to be modest simply because of the pace of the economy. Expectations six months ago were that the economy was booming and that's clearly not the case.' The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index  rose 49.9 points to 4,982.8 by 0045 GMT, after falling to its lowest level since August 2006 in the previous session. New Zealand's benchmark NZX-50 index  rose 1.1 percent, or 35.98 points, to 3,196.57. The most heavily weighted stock, Telecom Corp of New Zealand , was up 2.3 percent at NZ$3.55. STOCKS ON THE MOVE * Financial firms rose as investors drew comfort from Bernanke's comments, which signalled the Fed is determined to stop the housing-inspired credit crisis from causing further damage on the U.S. economy. Among the top banks, National Australia Bank rose 2.7 percent to A$27.07 and Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd  gained 1.8 percent to A$41.45. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd  added 1.9 percent to A$18.95 while Westpac Banking Corp  was up 0.9 percent at A$19.70. Macquarie Group , Australia's top investment bank, gained 4.1 percent to A$47.90. 0037 GMT * Energy firms fell after oil prices  tumbled more than $5 on Tuesday, pushing losses so far this week to about $10, as forecasters said a hurricane in the Atlantic would steer clear of offshore oil platforms and the U.S. dollar gained against other currencies. Woodside Petroleum fell 1.7 percent to A$57.70, Santos Ltd  lost 1.8 percent to A$18.47 and Oil Search Ltd  shed 2.2 percent to A$5.68. 0035 GMT * Insurance Australia Group Ltd  (IAG), Australia's top home and car insurer, fell 1.1 percent to A$3.63 after rising as much as 2.2 percent in early trade. IAG announced a partial exit from its struggling UK operations, taking a charge of A$350 million ($333 million) in fiscal 2008. IAG added it expects its insurance margin to improve to over 10 percent in fiscal 2009, compared with 6-8 percent in the previous year [ID:nSYD14038]. 0034 GMT .ng
