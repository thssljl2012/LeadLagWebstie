 SYDNEY, July 25 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 3.4 percent on Friday, the steepest one-day fall in six months, as further credit-related losses at National Australia Bank Ltd  triggered a major sell-off in the financial sector.Shares in NAB tumbled as much as 14.6 percent, its biggest single-day percentage drop since Oct. 20 1987, after it booked another A$830 million ($798 million) in losses from its exposure to collateralised debt obligations (CDOs). 'The move by NAB has seen worries about the Australian banks return with a vengeance,' said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital Investors.Also denting sentiment in the financial sector, data on Thursday showed sales of existing U.S. homes dropped to a 10-year low, further damaging U.S. financial firms which have been badly hit by the housing slump. 'Anything to do with CDOs just makes everyone so nervous and every time there is bad news about the U.S. housing market, it always generates fresh fears about economic recovery in the U.S,' said Lucinda Chan, division director at Macquarie Equities. 'Consumer sentiment around the globe is at its lowest ever. We all have to ride through this rough patch and it will be a slow and painful ride.' The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index  fell 173.6 points to 4,970.5, based on the latest available data, logging its largest one-day percentage fall since Jan. 22.Still, the index rose 2.7 percent on the week to end nine straight weeks of losses, after better-than-expected earnings at big U.S. banks, coupled with a drop in oil prices, lured investors back into the market earlier in the week.The index has now fallen 21.6 percent since the start of the year after rising 11.8 percent in 2007 and has dropped 27.4 percent from its lifetime high hit last November.New Zealand's benchmark NZX-50 index  fell 1 percent, or 33.06 points, to 3,254.16, taking losses so far this year to 19.5 percent. The most heavily weighted stock, Telecom Corp of New Zealand , rose 0.6 percent at NZ$3.49. FINANCIALS SLUMPShares in NAB ended down 13.5 percent at A$26.56, helping drive the financial services index  down 6.6 percent on the day, its biggest one-day percentage fall in six months.Among the other big banks, Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd  lost 6.8 percent to A$43.25, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd  shed 8.7 percent to A$17.75 and Westpac Banking Corp  fell 3.1 percent to A$22.09.Westpac and ANZ said there was no earnings impact from their CDOs exposure, and CBA said it had no direct exposure to CDOs.The weak U.S. home sales data and a jump in jobless claims added to worries about the health of the world's top economy, denting firms that make a large part of their earnings there.Building material firm James Hardie Industries  dropped 6.1 percent to A$4.65 and Westfield Group , the world's top shopping mall operator, lost 7.6 percent to A$16.15.Fertiliser maker Incitec Pivot Ltd  reversed an earlier fall of over 7 percent to end up 1.7 percent at A$152.14 after it said it had no current plans for an equity raising, dousing media speculation.Centro Properties Group  rose 7.8 percent to A$0.275.Centro has had strong interest from potential buyers for four Australian shopping centres worth over A$1 billion ($960 million), the firm involved in the sale said.($1=A$1.04)(Editing by James Thornhill) ((geraldine.chua@reuters.com; +61 2 9373 1818; Reuters Messaging: geraldine.chua.reuters.com@reuters.net)). ntInteractive Investor brings you breaking news throughout the day to support your investment decisions.
