 THE dollar ended weaker for the fourth successive trading day after ANZ flagged a sharp fall in earnings because of bad debt.The dollar finished the session at US95.56c, down from Friday's US95.82c. It slumped to its daily low of US95.27c just before noon, after ANZ flagged a $1.2 billion bad-debt provision for the second half of fiscal 2008. Australia's fourth-biggest bank also said its full-year cash earnings per share could fall by up to 25 per cent. Westpac chief currency strategist Robert Rennie said the dollar sank after the ANZ news helped weaken risk appetite and the local stock market fell. 'The ANZ news and weakness in the equity market certainly didn't help,' he said. The news from ANZ came after National Australia Bank's Friday announcement of an extra $830 million in provisions on its exposure to troubled US mortgage-backed securities. Mr Rennie said the dollar could sink to US94.50c in coming days if falling crude oil prices continued to weigh down the commodities-driven currency. The dollar was pulled down as the New York price of crude oil fell by 1.8 per cent to a two-month low of $US123.26 a barrel. But the currency recovered in the late afternoon and came close to retesting its morning high of US95.60c as the US dollar lost momentum. The Australian dollar finished at Y102.82, up from Friday's Y102.30, and at 60.82 euro cents, down from E60.97c. The euro finished at $US1.5711, down from Friday's $US1.5715, and at Y169.05, up from Y167.76. The US dollar closed the local session at Y107.60, up from Y106.76. The Australian bond market closed slightly firmer on further credit market concerns but was little changed during the local session. The yield on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was at 6.252 per cent, down from Friday's 6.257 per cent, while the June 2011 bond was at 6.267 per cent, down from 6.293 per cent. On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the September 10-year bond futures contract was at 93.76, up from Friday's 93.755, and the September three-year contract was at 93.73, up from 93.7. Fund manager Ausbil Dexia chief economist John Honan said there was an element of 'flight to safety' price action. Mr Honan said he was not surprised by the subdued reaction to the ANZ announcement. 'I think the Reserve Bank has influenced expectations quite successfully here in Australia,' he said. The 90-day bank bill rate closed at 7.76 per cent, up from Friday's close of 7.73 per cent, while the 180-day bank bill rate was at 7.91 per cent, up from 7.84 per cent. The Reserve Bank of Australia's trade weighted index was at72.8, down from Friday's close of 73. AAP
