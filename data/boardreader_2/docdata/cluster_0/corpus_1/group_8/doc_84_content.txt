) - The stock market in Australia declined for the first day in five trading sessions, led by resources after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on Rio Tinto. Profit booking was evident after the markets rallied in the past four trading sessions, including a 3% gain on Tuesday. The positive closing by the U.S market overnight and the strength in financials helped to limit the losses.   The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 shed 5.6 points, or 0.16% to close at 3,446 while the broader All Ordinaries Index dropped 7.2% or 0.21% to end at 3.386.  Resource stocks led the declines after Goldman Sachs cut the rating for Rio Tinto to 'sell' from 'hold'. The brokerage house opined that Rio Tinto's proposed deal with Aluminum Company of China, or Chinalco, might not materialize due to concerns about the debt levels of the third biggest mining company in the world.  Rio Tinto declined 8.86% following the downgrade, dragging the indices down. BHP Billiton lost 3.45%, Minara Sources declined 5.17% and Riversdale Mining dropped 6.41%.  Oil stocks were mixed, with Santos advancing 1.39%, while Woodside Petroleum and Oil Search lost 1.39% and 0.39% respectively.  Gold stocks also ended on a mixed note, with Lihir Gold advancing 1.32% while Sinoa-Gold and Newcrest Mining shed 4.98% and 2.71% respectively compared to previous day.  Among retail stocks, David Jones soared 9.24% after reporting a 2.4% rise in profit for the first half and affirming that its second-half profit will rise by 5% despite weak economic conditions and bleak forecast. Coles' owner Wesfarmers gained 1.58%. Woolworths, however, bucked the trend, and closed 0.71% lower.  Financial stocks continued to advance on expectations of stability in the banking sector. Commonwealth Bank added 0.77%, ANZ Bank advanced 2.49%, National Australia Bank ended 0.95% higher and Westpac Banking gained 0.51%.   by RTT Staff Writer  For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com
