 (RTTNews) - The major markets across the Asia-Pacific region are trading in negative territory on Thursday after a brief rally in the past two sessions, as optimism about a revival in the banking sector faded out amid deteriorating economic conditions. Investors are more concerned about the outlook for the global economy as stimulus packages rolled out by most countries are yet to bear any fruit.  The positive closing in the U.S market, notwithstanding the volatile trading during most of the session, failed to enthuse investors across the Asia-pacific region. The Dow closed up 4 points or 0.1% percent at 6,930, the Nasdaq closed up 13 points or 1% at 1,372 and the S&amp;P 500 closed up 2 points or 0.2% at 721.

Light sweet crude oil for April delivery dropped $3.38 or 7.39% to finish at $42.33 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
