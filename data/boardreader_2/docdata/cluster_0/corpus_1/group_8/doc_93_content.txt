 (RTTNews) - The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a modestly higher opening on Friday. The session is likely to witness volatility due to expiration of options and futures contract. Commodities have begun to pullback after yesterday's sharp rally. Bleak commentary by Sony Ericsson and Xerox (XRX) could rekindle worries over the impact of the economic downturn on corporate profit growth. In all probability, the markets could witness more profit taking ahead of the weekend or at the best some consolidation around current levels, given the paucity of economic news. Markets could also focus on Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's speech scheduled for the day.  While U.S. stock opened Thursday's session higher on optimism about the Fed's $1.2 trillion spending plan and some better than expected jobs data, buying interest waned not long after the open. The major averages subsequently turned lower over the course of early trading and lingered in negative territory for much of the remainder of the session. Profit taking contributed to the downturn by the markets following the recent gains.  The Dow Industrials ended down 85.78 points or 1.15% at 7,401 and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 7.74 points or 0.52% to 1,484, while the S&amp;P 500 Index moved down 10.31 points or 1.30% at 784.  Financials led the retreat of the Dow Industrials, with Bank of America (BA) (down 9.65%), Citigroup (C) (down 15.58%), JP Morgan Chase (JPM) (down 7.97%) posting steep losses. Other major decliners included Pfizer (PFE) (down 3.86%), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) (down 3.56%), 3M Co. (MMM) and Merck &amp; Co. (MRK) (down 3.86%). However, Alcoa (AA) surged up 16.79%, Caterpillar (CAT) gained 3.42% and General Motors (GM) rose 8.71%.  Among the sector indexes, the Amex Securities Broker/Dealer Index fell 8.09% compared to a 9.06% decline by the KBW Bank Index. A rise in oil prices sent airline stocks lower, with the Amex Airline Index slipping by 5.49%. On the other hand, the Amex Oil Index gained 2.11% and the Philadelphia Oil Service Index rallied 4.64%, while the Amex Gold Bugs Index climbed 7.34%. Buoyed by Oracle's (ORCL) positive results and maiden dividend announcement, the Amex Software Index rose 2.52%.  All eyes are now riveted towards the financial sector, as traders seem resigned to the fact that the market recovery largely hinges on the resurgence in the financial space. After a protracted downturn, the KBW Bank Index has begun to move up on heavy volume since March 10. The subsequent upsurge in the space has helped the index successfully move above its 50-day moving average, which is currently at 27.60. Despite Thursday's retreat, the index held support around this level. The November lows around 32.40 could serve as a major resistance area and therefore, a break above this level is crucial.  Meanwhile, volatility has remained in check, with the CBOE Volatility Index having formed a short-term downtrend since mid-January this year. The index is now sandwiched between its 50-day moving average of 45.66 and its 200-day moving average of 40.89.  On the economic front, initial jobless claims for the week ended March 14th were slightly lower than the expected at 646,000. However, continuing claims rose 185,000 to a new record high of 5.473 million. The report suggests that the job market continues to be weak. However, one can derive some comfort from the fact that the data is a lagging indicator and therefore, will improve after the economic recovery kicks in.  The Philadelphia Fed's manufacturing survey showed that conditions in the manufacturing sector in the region have improved in March from the month-ago levels, although remaining extremely weak. The diffusion index of current activity rose to -35 in March from -41.3 in February, while the new orders index fell 10 points to -40.7, its lowest level since July 1980.  The inventories index tumbled to a record low of -55.6 from -24.3 in the previous month, while the current employment index declined 6 points to -52. The prices paid index fell to a record low of -31.3. Meanwhile, the future general activity index remained positive, but it edged down 1.4 points to 14.5.  A report released by the Conference Board said the leading indicators index fell 0.4% month-over-month in February. The January reading is revised down to show a 0.1% increase from the 0.4% growth reported originally. The largest negative contributors were average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, stock prices, the index of consumer expectations and average weekly manufacturing hours. The lagging and the coincident indicators were down 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively. Currency, Commodity Markets Crude oil futures are slipping $1.01 to $50.60 a barrel after jumping $3.47 to $51.61 a barrel on Thursday. Weakness in the value of the dollar supported crude oil on Thursday and going forward, the downtrend in prices seen since July 2008 could stall when OPEC strictly implements the production cuts it has previously announced.  Gold futures are easing $4.70 to $954.10. The precious metal advanced $69.70 to $958.80 an ounce in the previous session.  On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 95.50 yen after weakening to 94.528 yen at the close of New York trading on Thursday. The dollar is currently valued at $1.3601 versus the euro. Asia Mixed trading was witnessed in the major markets across the Asia-Pacific region on Friday following weak cues from Wall Street, where profit taking dragged the major indices lower despite a rise in commodity, gold prices. The Japanese market was closed for a holiday.  In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index opened lower and declined further in early trading. After the first hour of trading, the selling pressure waned, resulting in sideways movement until late trading, when an intensification of the selling pressure sent the index sharply lower. At the close of trading, the index was down 297.41 or 2.26% at 12,834.  Financial stocks dragged down the market on profit taking. Bank of Communications declined 5.42%, Bank of China fell 4.22%, ICBC or Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China, dropped 5.43%, and CCB shed 5.24%. HSBC Holdings edged down 0.12% and Hang Seng Bank lost 3.06%.  Telecom stocks also showed weakness. Hutchison Whimpoa fell 2.65%, and China Mobile declined 5.40%. Insurance stocks also ended weak.

BHP Billiton, the largest mining company in the world, gained 3.46% and Rio Tinto, the third largest mining company in the world, advanced 3.58%. Among the resource stocks, Oz Minerals surged up more than 11% after Citigroup revised the outlook for the stock to 'buy' from 'hold' in anticipation of the government's approval of the acquisition of the company by China Minmetals Group for a consideration of US$1.8 billion. Oil and gold stocks also advanced  In South Korea, the benchmark KOSPI Index, having opened 3 points higher from previous close of 1,161, traded in positive territory throughout the day in a narrow range of 1,163 to 1,180 amid alternate bouts of buying and selling, and finally ended up 9 points, or 0.74% at 1,172.  In a significant development, the South Korean government, in an effort to arrest the sharp decline of the U.S. dollar against the local currency, has eased the regulations governing overseas borrowing by public companies. A number of private companies are reportedly eyeing the overseas markets for borrowing following the weakening of the U.S dollar. In a statement, POSCO, the fourth largest steel-maker in the world, announced that it has raised US$700 million by selling debt overseas at a rate of 8.95%. The company intends to utilize the proceeds as operating capital.  Steel, shipbuilders and oil stocks led the gains, while financial stocks ended weaker as investors took profits following a recent rally.
