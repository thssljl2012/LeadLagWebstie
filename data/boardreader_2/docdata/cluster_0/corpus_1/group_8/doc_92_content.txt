Australian shares have risen at the opening after Wall Street rallied overnight on stronger-than-expected US housing starts.  In early trade, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 0.8%, or 27.6 points, at 3479.5 - a one-month high, while the broader All Ordinaries index was up 0.7%, or 24.9 points, at 3418.3.  The Australian dollar continued to hold above 66 US cents, trading recently at 66.25 US cents, up from yesterday's local close of 66 US cents. It was also buying 65.43 yen and 50.84 euro cents.  David Joneswas one of the best performers on the market after posting a rise in first-half profit. Its shares were up 26 cents, or 10.5%, to $2.75 in early trade.  The materials sector was down 1.1%, but all other sub-indexes of the market were higher. Financials was up 1.8%, while energy was up 1.6%.  The big banks were all higher. The Commonwealth Bank rose 64 cents, or 2%, to $33.11 and ANZ was up 23 cents, or 1.6%, to $14.66.  NAB added 33 cents, or 1.7%, to $19.26 and Westpac was up 19 cents, or 1.1%, at $17.90.  Investment bank Macquarie Group continued its share surge, adding $1.60, or 7.3%, to $23.45. Suncorp Metway was up 5 cents, or 0.9%, at $5.60.  QBE Insurance was up 57 cents, opr 3.1%, at $18.68 and IAG was down 1 cent, or 0.3%, at $3.49.  AXA Asia Pacific was up 14 cents, or 4.3%, at $3.36 and AMP was up 8 cents, or 1.9%, at $4.39.  The big miners were down despite the Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of commodity prices rising 1.2% overnight.

OZ Minerals was flat at 58 cents, Fortescue Metals was up 2 cents, or 0.8%, at $2.44 and BlueScope Steel was up 10 cents, or 4.3%, to $2.45.  The Dow Jones industrial average gained 178.73 points, or 2.48%, to end at 7395.70 overnight, helped by an unexpected rise in February housing starts and speculation that the Federal Reserve will outline more plans to bolster the economy later today.  'I'm pretty encouraged every morning when I see the Dow closing in positive territory,'' said Shaw Stockbroking private client adviser Todd Kerslake.  Last night's US rally aside, Mr Kerslake said, 'our market has performed well when Wall Street is weaker''.  'Is it a bear market rally or will it be sustained?' he said. 'While it continues upwards, we'll keep our fingers crossed that it is a sustained rally.''  'Speaking to clients, it's a cautious optimism. We'd like to see it continue.''  'If we get two weeks or three weeks of it, it's hard to tell, but more it continues the more the confidence returns and hopefully so do the buyers.''  Mr Kerslake said in recent sessions a number of 'oversold and unloved'' stocks are having their day in the sun, as speculators reconsider their value.  The stronger February housing starts in the US, which came in at 583,000 - more than the 450,000 expected - may also give a 'small uptick'' to local building manufacturers, he said.  'Banking stocks were strong overnight,'' he said, although there could be a little weakness in miners, resulting from layoff annoucements at Caterpillar in the US.  The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index rose 24.23 points, or 3.2%, to 778.12. The Nasdaq Composite Index surged 58.09 points, or 4.1%, to 1462.11.  European stock markets closed lower on Tuesday, with London's FTSE 100 index of leading shares down 6.89, or 0.2%, to 3857.1 points. Continued
