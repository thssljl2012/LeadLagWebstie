LOCAL stocks fell 1.6 per cent today, but fared better than the US and Europe, as a broad sell-off erased the previous session's gains.  The position of the S&amp;P/ASX 200 in early afternoon deals compared with losses of more than 3 per cent on both sides of the Atlantic overnight.   ABN Amro sales trader James Trude said: We didnt end up adding that much yesterday, so we didnt have as much to give back, so thats probably why we arent down as much as the US. After a brief spell in positive territory yesterday - for the first time in five days - the benchmark index was down 50.9 points at 3137.6, while the All Ordinaries was 46.3 points lower at 3102.5.   Losses were concentrated in the telecommunications, financial, mining and industrial sectors as investors reduced their positions ahead of US unemployment data tonight, which is expected to show that several hundred thousand Americans had lost their jobs last month.   Gold and energy stocks were the standout performers, with gains in Lihir Gold, Newcrest Mining, Santos and Origin Energy containing losses in the broader market.  Telstra slumped 4.8 per cent after going ex-dividend, while Commonwealth Bank shed 2.5 per cent, Westpac lost 1.8 per cent, ANZ slipped 1.1 per cent and National Australia Bank fell 0.2 per cent following reports it was planning to cut hundreds of jobs.  BHP Billiton was down 2.9 per cent and Rio Tinto was off 0.4 per cent after copper fell from three-month highs.  Lihir added 4 per cent and Newcrest piled on 2.8 per cent after gold rallied sharply overnight on safe-haven buying.  Santos was up 3.5 per cent and Origin was 0.9 per cent higher.
