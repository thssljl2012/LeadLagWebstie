By Simone Giuliani MELBOURNE, March 12 (Reuters) - Australian stocks eased 0.3 percent on Thursday as concerns over a gloomy economic outlook at home and overseas induced caution, though gains for National Australia Bank offered support. Australia's latest employment report on Thursday showed the jobless rate jumped to its highest level in almost four years last month to 5.2 percent. 'Investors are quite sceptical now,' said Albert Hung, chief investment officer at Alleron Investment Management. 'They are behaving very cautiously...which is prudent because the economy is still in very poor shape and there are no clear signs of recovery yet,' Hung said. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 index dropped 8.9 points to 3,235.5, breaking two days of gains which added 2.8 percent to the index. New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index fell 5.9 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,491.6. The nation's central bank cut interest rates to an all-time low of 3 percent on Thursday, but signalled the easing cycle was close to an end.. NOT DIABOLICAL NAB climbed 2.6 percent to A$16.73. The nation's top lender announced a 25 percent dividend cut, but analysts said the market was happy the update did not contain any more bad news . 'To cut your dividend by 25 percent is bad, obviously, but it could have been a lot worse,' said Todd Kerslake, private client adviser at Shaw Stockbroking. 'The market has been in a situation where it has been putting sell pressure on them for the last few sessions and now they can see that the world hasn't come to an end and it wasn't diabolical,' Kerslake said. NAB's share price has fallen more than 5 percent in the past five trading days while the rest of Australia's top four banks have gained between 5-7 percent. The pattern was largely reversed on Thursday with most of NAB's rivals falling as it gained. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd fell 2.2 percent to A$12.86 while Westpac Banking Corp shed 1.6 percent to A$16.60. Oil producers also slipped after the price of crude oil fell more than 7 percent on demand worries. Woodside Petroleum Ltd fell 2.7 percent to A$35.98 and Beach Petroleum Ltd declined 5.8 percent to A$0.82. Lihir Gold Ltd advanced 4.6 percent to A$2.99 and Newcrest Mining Ltd climbed 2.7 percent to A$31.74 after the price of gold bounced above $900 an ounce. Shares in New Zealand's largest listed retailer Warehouse Group Ltd fell 2 percent to NZ$3.45 after the group reported a 24 percent fall in first-half net profit on weaker sales and one-off costs..
