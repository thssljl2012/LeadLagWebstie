THE Australian share market was stronger at noon with gains in the resources sector and hope that China would stimulate its economy, having a flow-on effect.  At noon (Sydney time), the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 31.4 points at 3,197.8, while the broader All Ordinaries index had added 32.6 points to 3,158.5.   On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was up 29 points at 3,191. 'It's a bit of a weaker session that the futures were pointing to before the open,' CMC Markets analyst David Taylor said. 'There are encouraging signs that China might stimulate its economy and that's helped mining stocks, and gold stocks are down following weak gold prices.' In the resources sector, market giant BHP Billiton gained $1.76, or 6.49 per cent, to $28.87, while rival Rio Tinto was up $2.62, or 6.03 per cent, at $46.09.   National Australia Bank lost 26 cents to $16.94, Commonwealth Bank added eight cents to $27.35, Westpac added 30 cents to $16, and ANZ was up seven cents to $12.52.
