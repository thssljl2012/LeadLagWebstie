Hong Kong shares fell 2.4 per cent on Friday, with HSBC (SEHK: 0005, announcements, news)  dropping to a 13-year closing low as bank stocks dipped globally, while mainland stocks also retreated as Beijing did not announce new stimulus spending as expected.  But mainland lenders China Construction Bank (SEHK: 0939, announcements, news)  and Bank of China rose ahead of the rebalancing of the Hang Seng Index on Monday, which will see a higher weighting for both the stocks. China Construction Bank rose 1.5 per cent while Bank of China climbed 1.4 per cent.  HSBC fell 2.9 per cent to HK$43.50.  The massive sell-off this week has seen the banks shares dive 24 per cent and its market value shrink by US$21 billion after the London-based lender announced a US$17.7 billion rights issue at a deep discount and slashed its dividend.  Its Hong Kong unit, Hang Seng Bank (SEHK: 0011, announcements, news) , slid for a fifth straight day, falling 7.4 per cent to HK$73.60, after the lender reported a sharp drop in second-half earnings on Monday.  The benchmark Hang Seng Index ended 289.72 points lower at 11,921.52, taking the weeks losses to 7 per cent, its worst performance in seven weeks.  We will test November last year lows again, said Peter Lai, director with DBS Vickers. With the Dow and Tokyo market at record lows, there is no way Hong Kong can stay unaffected, Mr Lai said.  Funds have moved to Hong Kong in the past few weeks on hopes of big moves from China but since China has not announced anything tangible we cant stay unmoved for very long, he added.  Other financial stocks were also hit, with local lender BOC Hong Kong (SEHK: 2388) down 5 per cent while Bank of East Asia (SEHK: 0023), where both the CEO and the CFO have resigned, dropped 5.3 per cent to HK$13.32.  You just have to look at how Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Barclays performed on Thursday to understand why banking stocks are down today. Fear has gripped the sector, said Alex Wong, director with Ample Finance.  Canadas top insurer, Manulife Financial, took another tumble, sliding 10.1 per cent to HK$62.30 after its Toronto-listed shares plunged on Thursday.  The stock has lost nearly 50 per cent of its market value in the last two weeks as global markets dropped, hitting the insurers key regulatory capital ratio.  Turnover of Hong Kong shares rose to HK$46.9 billion from HK$43.1 billion on Thursday.  The China Enterprises Index of top mainland firms was down 1.7 per cent at 6,785.47.  Shares in offshore oil specialist CNOOC (SEHK: 0883) fell 3.2 per cent to HK$6.08 as oil prices dropped overnight and stayed below US$44 per barrel in Asian trade on a bearish euro zone outlook.  Asias top oil and gas producer, PetroChina (SEHK: 0857, announcements, news) , shed 2.7 per cent to HK$5.12, while refiner Sinopec (SEHK: 0386) was down 3.1 per cent.  Other commodity stocks also pulled back, partly erasing recent gains, with Aluminum Corp of China (SEHK: 2600) (Chalco) down 3.6 per cent.  But gold miners bucked the downtrend in the broad market even as gold prices eased on Friday after rising 2 per cent overnight on its safe-haven appeal.  Zijin Mining (SEHK: 2899) was up 2.6 per cent while Lingbao Gold gained 6.4 per cent.
