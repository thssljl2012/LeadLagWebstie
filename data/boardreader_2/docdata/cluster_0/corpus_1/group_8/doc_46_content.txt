The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index fell 52.8 points, or 1.64 per cent, to 3166.4, while the broader All Ordinaries shed 45.5 points, or 1.43 per cent, to 3125.9.  Yesterday was the lowest close on the S&amp;P/ASX200 Index since August 2003.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March Share Price Index contract was 9 points lower at 3162 on a volume of 31,596 contracts.  CMC Markets senior dealer Dominic Vaughan said the market was initially down after a negative lead from Wall Street overnight on Tuesday.  'The financials were heavily sold early but have gained some traction, although Commonwealth Bank and ANZ are down over 3 per cent and the two mining heavyweights - Rio and BHP - are both down as well,' he said.  'Negative sentiment still weighs on this market across most sectors, and today's GDP number reinforced that it is going to be another difficult six months for Australian companies.'  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 37.27 points to 6726.02.  Locally, the banking sector was weaker, with ANZ shedding 51c to $12.45, Commonwealth Bank $1.02 to $27.27, National Australia Bank 12c to $17.20 and Westpac 37c to $15.70.
