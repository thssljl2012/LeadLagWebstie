The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 43 points, or 1.35 per cent, at 3,145.5, while the broader All Ordinaries index shed 37.1 points, or 1.18 per cent, to 3,111.7.  It was the S&amp;P/ASX 200's weakest close since mid July 2003.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange at 1617 AEDT, the March share price index futures contract was 29 points lower at 3,140 on a volume of 21,733 contracts.  IG Markets head of institutional dealing Chris Weston said BHP Billiton, Commonwealth Bank and Telstra were among the most heavily traded stocks.  'Financials could not escape the bleak sentiment that was mustered up by their US counterparts ... following a possible Moody's credit downgrade on JPMorgan and Citigroup,' Mr Weston said.  'Our domestic banks experienced a heavy sell-off.'  Commonwealth Bank was down 33 cents at $27.00, Westpac eased nine cents to $15.70, National Australia Bank was three cents higher at $16.80 and ANZ retreated 29 cents to $12.36.  ANZ and Merrill Lynch have reached an in-principle $253 million settlement agreement with the liquidators of failed stockbroker Opes Prime and the corporate regulator.  Meanwhile, US shareholders of ANZ are mobilising as part of a class action alleging bank executives made false statements about the Opes Prime saga to inflate the bank's share price.  Mining giant BHP Billiton gave up 66 cents, or 2.33 per cent, to $27.65 while Rio Tinto was down five cents at $45.70.
