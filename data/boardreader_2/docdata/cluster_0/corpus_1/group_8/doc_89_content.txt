 (RTTNews) - The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a narrowly mixed opening on Tuesday. Of the two economic reports released earlier in the day, the housing market report showed an unexpected increase in housing starts for February. Meanwhile, the producer price inflation data showed an easing in inflationary pressures. Although the reports suggest an improvement, companies continue to relay negative tidings.  Alcoa (AA) announced measures, including a dividend reduction, to conserve cash, while handset maker Nokia (NOK) unveiled plans to cut jobs. That said, Standard Chartered Bank should offer support to the financial space.  U.S. stocks opened Monday's session higher after reassuring comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke about the timeline for the end of the recession and the U.K.'s Barclays that it has fared well thus far this year generated buying interest. However, the major averages showed divergence shortly after the open, with the Nasdaq Composite Index trading in the red, while the Dow Industrials and S&amp;P 500 Index continued to advance till early afternoon trading. The weakness in the technology space was broad based.  Selling pressure set in thereafter, dragging the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 Index lower, with the indexes dropping below the unchanged line in late trading after American Express (AXP) revealed in a filing that its net charge offs rose to 8.70% in February from 8.30% in January. Although the Nasdaq Composite Index made a come back in the afternoon, it fell again to close sharply lower.  The Dow Industrials, which rallied to an intra-day high of 7,428.75 in the session, declined 7.01 points or 0.10% to close at 7,217 and the S&amp;P 500 Index receded 2.66 points or 0.35% to 754, while the Nasdaq Composite Index moved down 27.48 points or 1.92% to 1,404.  General Motors (GM) led the Dow's decline, with a drop of about 7.35%. Intel (INTC) (down 3.06%), American Express (down 3.28%), Home Depot (HD) (down 2.75%) and JP Morgan Chase (JPM) (down 2.78%) were among the other notable decliners. On the other hand, Citigroup (C) jumped 30.90%, Alcoa (AA) rallied 6.81% and Bank of America (BAC) rose 7.29%. DuPont (DD) gained close to 4%.  Among the other sector indexes, the Amex Securities Broker/Dealer Index receded 2.94%.

In the technology space, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, the Amex Disk Drive Index and the Amex Computer Hardware Index declined over 3% each, while the Amex Internet Index lost 2.21%.

On Monday, the Dow Transportation did not confirm the Dow's downward move with a solid advance. Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index rose 1.38 yesterday to 43.74, with the index moving sideways in recent sessions after it rallied off its January lows this year to a short-term peak around 56.65 on January 20th. The short-term trend of the market cannot be predicted accurately, given the fluid conditions in the market, as traders react hysterically to even the slightest hint of problems at financial firms.  That said, the broader trend is pointing mostly towards more losses at least until investor confidence is restored and traders are convinced that a recovery is on the works. Until then, the market should be bracing for the kind of volatility we have been witnessing in the aftermath of the credit crisis.  On the economic front, the New York Fed's manufacturing survey showed that the manufacturing index fell to a new low of -38.2 in March from -30.80 in February.

Meanwhile, the Treasury said yesterday that foreigners sold a net of $43 billion worth of securities in January.  The Federal Reserve's industrial production report showed a 1.4% drop in industrial output. Although auto production rose 10.2% following 4 months of declines, a drop in the output in computer manufacturing, utilities and products, excluding defense, offset the gain. Capacity utilization continued to decrease, with the current rate of utilization being 10 percentage points below the average of 1972-2008.  Meanwhile, the housing market index remained unchanged at 9 in March, according to a report released by the National Homebuilders Association. The index was about 1 point above the record low of 8 in December and January. The index gauging current sales conditions held steady at 7 and the index gauging sales expectations in the next six months also remained at a record low of 15. However, the index gauging traffic of prospective buyers declined 2 points to 9. Currency, Commodity Markets Crude oil futures are receding $0.51to $46.84 a barrel after rising $1.10 to $47.35 a barrel on Monday. On Monday, oil ignored bearish news from OPEC, which opted to hold output levels unchanged after reducing production by 4.2 million barrels per day in 2008. The decision reflected the oil cartel's view to wait for further action only after enforcing stricter compliance with existing production cuts. According to Commerzbank, another cut in production quotas could have harmed OPEC's credibility if it had ultimately not been put into place.  Gold futures are moving $3 to $919 an ounce. In the previous session, the precious metal rose $8.10 to $922 an ounce.  On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 98.882 compared to the 98.318 yen it was worth at the close of New York trading on Monday. The dollar is currently valued at $1.2966 versus the euro.

Yesterday, the euro rose above the $1.30 level for the first time since February.
