British Telecom could be forced to pour an extra 750m a year into the company pension pot if the board of trustees take a severely conservative position.  Even a moderate view could still see annual top-up contributions of about 500m - something that is beginning to weigh heavily on investors' minds. Broker Morgan Stanley today advised clients to get out of the telecoms giant and downgraded it to underweight from overweight. It calculates that the pension fund had a hole of about 6.6bn at the end of last year, but further market falls mean the figure today is probably closer to 8.8bn.  'With pension assets of about 30bn and a market cap of 7bn, Bt's sector-relative and absolute performance will be driven more than ever by market direction,' the bank says. The shares were down 1.8p or 2 per cent at 81.6p. Morgan Stanley has slashed its target to 110p from 160p. It remains pretty bearish on the rest of the sector, trimming targets on Vodafone, down 0.15p at 117.85p, and Cable &amp; Wireless, up 0.1p at 133p.

Plumbing supplies group Wolseley headed the FTSE 100 fallers, down 5.4p at 160p as dealers moaned that its rights issue discount is not big enough.  A possible sale of some pubs owned by Punch taverns renewed interest in the sector. Altium securities analyst Greg Feehely pointed out the divergence in performance between the operators, with some making spectacular gains.  JD Wetherspoon and Mitchells &amp; Butlers have seen their shares rally in the past quarter - Wetherspoon, up 0.5p at 368.5p, has advanced by 48 per cent in the period and M&amp;B, 1.5p ahead at 218p, by 67 per cent. The brewing pub companies have also fared well, with Greene King, 1.75p ahead at 396.75p, up 24.2 per cent and Marston's, 1.25p better at 112p, gaining 31.4 per cent.  Even so, Feehely thinks investors could see further increases. Of the four companies he is picking, M&amp;B and Greene King are rated buys while Marston's and Wetherspoon are seen as holds.
