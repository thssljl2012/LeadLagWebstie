THE share market oscillated between positive and negative territory at noon as investors retreated to the sidelines.  At 12.00pm (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 0.2 points, or 0.01 per cent, at 3154.7, while the broader All Ordinaries index lost 4.7 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 3117.0.   Trading volumes were 'unbelievably poor'' with only $1 billion in turnover by noon, Burrell Stockbroking associate Peter Wright said. 'I've seen $1 billion (in turnover) done by 10.10am,'' Mr Wright said. 'Everyone is sitting on the sidelines, and anyone who wants to sell has sold.''  Uncertainty continues to plague financial stocks, he said.  Australia's major lenders were mostly stronger, with Commonwealth Bank gaining 3.49 per cent, to $27.57, ANZ Banking Group adding 1.36 per cent to $12.70 and Westpac putting 1.7 per cent to $16.17.  NAB was steady at $16.03.  QBE Insurance added 50 cents, or 3.21 per cent, to $16.10 on profit taking and short covering, Mr Burrell said.  Investors were using derivatives and other avenues to bypass the ban on shorting financial stocks, he said.  Base metals are now trading between 25 per cent and 30 per cent above their December lows leading to some traction in the resources sector, Mr Wright said.  Rio Tinto's volume was very low, he said.  By 12.13pm, Rio Tinto gained 20 cents, or 0.42 per cent, to $47.70, on turnover of only 1.8 million, while BHP Billiton slipped one cents, or 0.03 per cent, to $29.11.   Oil stocks were higher, with Oil Search adding 2.28 per cent to $4.94, Santos climbing 2.04 per cent to $16.04, and Woodside Petroleum up 2.2 per cent to $36.70.   But the gold sector lost ground as the gold price retreated.  Lihir Gold fell 3.49 per cent to $3.04, Newcrest Mining dropped 2.87 per cent to $30.50, and Newmont Mining lost 2.17 per cent to $5.86.  The spot price of gold in Sydney was $US918.60 per fine ounce, down $US18.40 on yesterday's local close of $US937.00.  Media stocks were mixed.   Consolidated Media was the only media stock to move higher 2.08 per cent, to $1.96.  Fairfax Media lost 2.37 per cent to 82.5 cents, News Corporation (the parent company of the publisher of news.com.au) fell 3.74 per cent, to $9.01 and the Seven Network dropped 4 cents to $6.07.   Retailers were also confused in midday trading.  Pacific Brands gained 13.3 per cent to 17 cents, surfwear retailer Billabong was down 5 cents at $6.59, and David Jones shed 4.17 per cent, to $2.07.  Woolworths fell 1.91 per cent to $25.22.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was 7 points, or 0.22 per cent, higher at 3156 on a volume of 10,560 contracts.
