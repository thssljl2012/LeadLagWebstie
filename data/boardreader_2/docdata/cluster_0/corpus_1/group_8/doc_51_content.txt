MINERS drove up the share market for the first time in five days after China reaffirmed its 2009 growth target of 8 per cent.  They retreated from their peak, however, after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao made no mention of any new stimulus in his opening address to the National People's Congress in Beijing.   Traders said a large sell portfolio in the market and more disappointing economic data put extra pressure on the market. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 rose 22.1 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 3188.5 after touching 3218.3 in the morning session.   The benchmark index, in the tight grip of a global bear market in equities, is down 14.3 per cent so far this year and is 53.5 per cent below its November 2007 all-time peak of 6851.5.   The All Ordinaries closed 22.9 points higher at 3148.8.   Investors were in a buoyant mood even before the market opened after US and European shares rallied on expectations China would unveil a stimulus package on top of the one announced in November, to boost economic growth.   China did not announce a package, however -- leading some traders to speculate that it might be holding off until the iron ore and coal price negotiations finish later this year, so as to not drive up commodity prices.   BHP Billiton rose 4.4 per cent to $28.30 and Rio Tinto piled on 5.2 per cent to $45.75 after copper rallied to its highest level since late November and Premier Wen said China could achieve 8 per cent growth this year despite the deepening global crisis.   Oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum rose 49c to $34.20 and Santos gained 20c to $14.68.   In gold, Lihir was off 31c at $3, Newmont fell 2c to $6.08 and Newcrest fell 26c to $31.13.   The gold price in Sydney was $US913.10 a fine ounce, up US85c on Wednesday's $US912.25 close.   Phosphate explorer Minemakers nudged up 1c to 40c as it launched a $7.6 million takeover bid for Bonaparte Diamond Mines to increase its geographic diversity to the fertiliser ingredient. Bonaparte eased 0.5c to 3.8c.   Banks were mostly higher after the Australian securities watchdog decided to extend a ban on short selling financial stocks from tomorrow until May 31.   Suncorp Metway rose 8.9 per cent to $5.02, ANZ Bank added 1.6 per cent to $12.65, Westpac was up 0.6 per cent to $15.79 and Commonwealth Bank firmed 0.2 per cent to $27.33.   National Australia Bank bucked the positive trend, falling 2.5 per cent to $16.77.   Telstra fell 3c to $3.34 but was the top-traded stock by volume, 105.6 million shares worth $359.5 million changing hands.   The mood in the market darkened after sharp falls in building approvals and imports in January supported claims Australia was already in recession after gross domestic product shrank by 0.5 per cent in the December quarter after growing 0.1 per cent in the third quarter.   ABN AMRO sales trading head Justin Gallagher said the uncertain economic outlook was keeping the market range-bound as nervous investors bought stocks one day only to take profits the next as they waited for more stability and certainty to return.
