SYDNEY, March 2 (Reuters) - Australian stocks are seen starting lower on Monday after ongoing worries about the global financial sector saw Wall Street fall further on Friday.  U.S. stocks took another battering on worries the government would continue to increase its role in the country's major banks and gloomy fourth-quarter growth data.  Australian March share price index (SPI) futures fell 40 points to 3,276 points, a 68.5-point discount to Friday's close in the underlying share index, when the market ended flat.  Official data on business inventories and company profits for the fourth quarter are due at 11.30 a.m (0030 GMT), while the TD-MI inflation gauge for February is out at 10.30 a.m.  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd  will be in focus after sources told Reuters late on Sunday that it has hired Credit Suisse to advise on a potential $2 billion bid for Royal Bank of Scotland's Asian units.
