Oil prices slid in Asian trade yesterday as fresh turmoil rocked the global financial sector, analysts said. New York's main futures contract, light sweet crude for April delivery, fell US$0.35 to US$39.80 a barrel.  Brent North Sea crude for April shed US$0.60 to US$41.61 per barrel.  The downward revision in U.S. GDP data and high jobless claims data 'are at the core of the economic woes and the ultimate drag on energy prices,' said Phil Flynn, vice president of Alaron Trading Corporation.  The U.S. government announced last Friday that gross domestic product (GDP) shrank at a worse-than-expected 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008, raising renewed fears about energy demand in the world's biggest economy.  Sentiment was also spooked by the U.S. government's latest massive bailout package for insurance giant AIG worth US$30 billion.  'The financial situation, weak manufacturing, weak employment - recession pressures the oil prices, and that's the major concern,' said James Williams, an economist at WTRG Economy.
