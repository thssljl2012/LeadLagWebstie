THE Australian share market overcame a negative start to close higher, boosted by stronger energy and financial sectors, but the volume of trading was low. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 30 points, or 0.95 per cent, at 3184.5, while the broader All Ordinaries gained 21.5 points, or 0.69 per cent, to 3143.2.   On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was 18 points higher at 3167 on a volume of 23,514 contracts. 'There were good leads from the financial stocks in the US,' IG Markets research analyst Ben Potter said. 'The UK (financial sector) wasn't so good, but in the US we saw Bank of America up about 20 per cent, so that's carrying over to Australia.' Energy stocks gained on higher oil prices, which resulted from speculation that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries would cut production levels.   Mr Potter said trading volumes were low as investors sat on the sidelines, spooked by comments overnight by billionaire US investor Warren Buffett that the US economy had 'fallen off a cliff'. Among the major local banks, National Australia Bank lifted 25c to $16.28, Commonwealth Bank strengthened $1.14 to $27.78, ANZ rose 21c to $12.74 and Westpac climbed 55c to $16.45.   In the resources sector, global miner BHP Billiton improved 16c to $29.28 and Rio Tinto was 80c richer at $48.30.   Oil and gas supplier Woodside Petroleum was up $1.18 at $37.09 and Santos jumped 65c to $16.37.   Telstra lost 14c to close at $3.14 as the telco giant said it would begin upgrading its capital cities cable broadband networks in a bid to stem diminishing fixed-line revenue and to show that it had an alternative to the federal Government's broadband plans.   In the gold sector, Newmont dipped 12c to $5.87, Newcrest sagged 65c to $30.75 and Lihir backtracked 10c to $3.05.   The price of gold in Sydney was $US917.35 per fine ounce, down $US19.65 on Monday's close of $US937.00.   Among media stocks, News Corporation was off 31c at $9.05 and its non-voting scrip retreated 30c to $7.97.   Consolidated Media firmed 0.5c to $1.925, while Fairfax eased 1.5c to 83c.   Supermarket chain Woolworths was 57c poorer at $25.14 but Wesfarmers, which owns rival Coles, added 38c to $17.19.   Among other stocks, clothing maker Pacific Brands put on 2c to 17c as it said recently retrenched workers could keep their jobs if a buyer could be found for its premises.   The top-traded stock by volume was property firm Goodman Group, with 95.9 million shares worth $14.76 million changing hands. The shares were 0.5c higher at 16c.   National turnover was 1.14 billion shares worth $3.22 billion, with 350 stocks up, 480 down and 297 unchanged.   On Wall Street earlier yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average index fell 79.89 points, or 1.21 per cent, to 6547.05 as investors were torn between hopes for the financial sector and fears about the slide of the broader US economy.
