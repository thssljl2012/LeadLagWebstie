  LONDON (AFP) London's FTSE 100 index of leading shares struck its lowest level for almost six years on Monday as the market reacted to more bleak news from the financial sector.  Approaching midday in London, the FTSE 100 was down by almost 177 points, or 4.62 percent, to 3,653.29 points -- the lowest level since April 1, 2003 in the wake of the invasion of Iraq.  The FTSE, which was already showing a loss of about 3.0 percent in reaction to news that Europe's biggest bank HSBC was seeking a cash injection of nearly 18 billion dollars, fell further when US insurance giant AIG said it had made a quarterly net loss of 61.7 billion dollars.
