LONDON (ShareCast) - The FTSE 100 is showing the first signs of bottoming out after a brutal morning session which saw it lose 4% of its value.   Shares in the financial sector are hardest hit, with banks, properties and insurers all featuring prominently among the biggest fallers.   HSBCwidely regarded as the healthiest of the UK banks, has turned to shareholders to shore up its balance sheet and has also rebased its dividend payment. The banking giant is to raise in the region of 12.5bn through a fully underwritten rights issue. The new shares will be issued at 254p, on the basis of 5 new shares for every 12 shares currently held. HSBC's shares closed at 491.25p on Friday, the day before the rights issue was announced. Lloyds, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland are lower in sympathy.   Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered is also sharply lower on a read across from the performance of HSBC's Asian business. The company is also rumoured to be in the frame to buy the 53% stake in Nedlloyd currently owned by South African insurer Old Mutual. The rumours do not seem to be helping Old Mutual's share price, either, as it is the worst performing share in the insurance sector with the exception of Legal &amp; General, though the weakness of the insurance sector is more to do with American insurer AIG confirming a near $62bn quarterly loss.   Properties are in full retreat after SEGRO, the company formerly known as Slough Estates, confirmed it is contemplating an equity issue.   Strong demand for university textbooks and high sales of the Financial Times newspaper helped publisher Pearson lift pre-tax profits by a quarter over 2008. Pre-tax profits climbed to 585m from 468m as revenues rose to 4.81bn from 4.16bn.   Hotels, coffee shop and restaurant group Whitbread has warned that sales have turned negative in recent weeks with no clear trading pattern. 'The sales trends we reported in December continued and in recent weeks group like-for-like sales have been predominantly negative, particularly due to lower occupancy in Premier Inn,' chief executive Alan Parker said.   Strong growth in the Middle East, eastern Europe and Australia helped hole digger Keller report a 10% hike in pre-tax profits, but the firm said it was entering tougher conditions. Keller, whihc prepares the ground before construction starts, said pre-tax profits from continuing operations for 2008 climbed to 113.2m on revenues that were up 25% to 1.2bn.   Higher hurricane claims and lower investment income sent profits tumbling at Amlin last year, though the underwriter remains upbeat over prospects going forward. Pre-tax profits for 2008 fell to 121.6m from 445m as its combined ratio deteriorated to 76% from 63%, though still very strong, and returns on its investment portfolio fell from 6.6% to 0.6%.   Persimmon the heavily indebted housebuilder, has renegotiated the terms of its borrowing arrangements. Full details of the revised arrangements will be issued shortly, but the company confirmed it has also signed a new forward start banking facility of 322m which will expire on 31 March 2012.   -equity group Candover Investments has opted not to pay a final dividend after its net asset value per share halved in 2008. Net asset value (NAV) per share plunged to 1026p at the end of 2008 from 2065p at the end of 2007, reflecting the decline in the worth of its investments, which have been valued in reference to the earnings multiples of similar publicly quoted companies.
