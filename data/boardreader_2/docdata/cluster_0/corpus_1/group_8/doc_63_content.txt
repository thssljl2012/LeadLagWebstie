Australian shares are expected to ease this morning after Wall Street ended lower and precious and base metals fell.  Futures in Sydney were down 15 points at 3134. Yesterday, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index rose 9 points, or 0.3%, to 3154.5, while the broader All Ordinaries index gained 10 points to 3121.7.  Lisa Jarvis of ABN AMRO Morgans said she expected a ''generally down day for the market.''  ''BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto might not help us as much as they did yesterday,'' she said. ''BHP was driving the rally yesterday.''  ''At the moment US futures are ever so slightly negative so there's not much to push us up.'' Dow Jones futures, which generate sentiment local investors can look to, were down 12 points to 6516 this morning.  Resource stocks may ease after the closely watched Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of commodity prices fell 0.6% overnight.  The Australian dollar retreated, trading recently at 63.15 US cents, down from yesterday's local close of 63.97 US cents. The dollar was also worth 50.09 euro cents and 62.47 yen.  Ms Jarvis said ''currency is becoming an issue'' for Australian stocks.  ''The Aussie could fall lower on expectations of further interest rate cuts,'' she said.  The local currency has been in a retreat since July when it was at near parity with the US dollar, amid all-time record high commodities prices.  ''A lot is tied up with offshore buying of BHP,'' said Ms Jarvis, including commodities prices and currency values. If those continue to weaken, it could weigh on the Australian market because BHP ''is such a big part of our index.''  Wall Street  With little good economic news or direction from Washington, the pessimism on Wall Street intensified on Monday, sending stocks lower.  The Dow Jones industrial average closed lower overnight after a session in which investors struggled between hopes for the financial sector and fears about the broader economy's slide.  The Dow shed 79.89, or 1.2%, to 6547.05. The S&amp;P 500 index lost 6.85, or 1%, to 676.53, while the Nasdaq composite index had fallen 25.21, or 2%, to 1268.64 - its lowest since 2002.  The main European markets ended higher.  In the UK, Britain's FTSE 100 index gained 11.67 points, or 0.33%, to 3542.4 points, while Germany's DAX was 25.62 points, or 0.7%, higher at 3692.03.  The CAC-40 in France was up 15.16 points, or 0.6%, at 2519.29.  Local news  Local news may be dominated by fresh reports on the employment sector.  The National Australia Bank issues its business survey for February, and ANZ releases its job advertisements survey for February.  The Manpower-Melbourne Institute Employment Report for March is also due.  David Jones chief executive Mark McInnes and Australian National Retailers Association chief executive Margy Osmond announce their response to the second cash bonus on Tuesday morning.
