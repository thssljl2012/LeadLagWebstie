ASX takes a hit after GDP data  Figures worse than expected  THE ASX fell sharply this morning after data showing the Australian economy shrank for the first time in eight years weighed heavily on equities.  By 11.45am (AEDT) , the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 73.6 points, or 2.29 per cent, at 3105, while the broader All Ordinaries index had shed 65.7 points, or 2.07 per cent, to 3105.  The Australian dollar also reacted negatively to the news, trading at $US0.6385 just before the data was released at 11.30am, but falling to $US0.6292 shortly afterwards.  'The market was reacting badly to the negative GDP figures,' said Bell Direct Equities Analyst Julia Lee.  'Wall Street was a bit up and down last night but that's no reason for us to be down by over one per cent,'' Austock Securities senior client adviser and strategist Michael Heffernan said.  'It's been very disappointing, especially in the banking sector, and the resources are lower, as well,'' he said.  Gross domestic product was negative 0.5 per cent in the December quarter, Australia Bureau of Statistics data shows.  The resource sector declined as GDP figures were announced.  BHP Billiton shed 2 per cent to $26.74 while rival Rio Tinto dropped 3.2 per cent to $42.59.  Banks were lower, too.  Commonwealth Bank and ANZ lost around 3 per cent, with Westpac and NAB down 1.5 per cent each.  Energy stocks were mixed at the 10.15am open.  Santos was up 15 cents at $14.90, Woodside was 18 cents lower at $34.05 and Oil Search added 2 cents to $4.82.  Among the retailers, Woolworths was 19 cents lower at $26.63, David Jones lost 4 cents to $2.14 and Coles owner Wesfarmers sank 65 cents to $16.97.  Making news, shares in Lihir Gold have been placed in a trading halt ahead of a $US325 million capital raising by the Papua New Guinea-based miner. Lihir shares last traded at $3.31.  The trading halt is not expected to last beyond the opening of trade on Friday, March 6, Lihir said.  In other gold stocks, Newcrest shed 77 cents to $30.76 and Newmont Mining added 13 cents to $6.21.  At 10.40am, the spot price of gold in Sydney was $US913.75 per fine ounce, down $US13.25 on Tuesday's local close of $US927.00.  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average gave up its earlier gains to close down 37.27 points, or 0.55 per cent, to 6,726.02.  The S&amp;P 500 index lost 4.49 points, or 0.64 per cent, to 696.33, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 1.84 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 1321.01.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was down 22 points to 3149 on a volume of 7469 contracts.
