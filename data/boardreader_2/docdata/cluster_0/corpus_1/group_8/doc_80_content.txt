(RTTNews) - The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a notably higher opening on Wednesday. Global cues are positive, with the Asian markets advancing on the financials-led rally and the European markets trading mostly highly. Additionally, commodity prices are showing some resurgence, leading traders to hope for a recovery in the near future. The rally could also be explained by the extremely oversold conditions. That said, a meaningful recovery seems to be a far cry, given little evidence for an improvement in fundamental conditions.  The parched markets were quenched on Tuesday, when positive tidings from Citigroup (C), whose shares fell below $1 last week, sent the major averages skyrocketing. The Citi news was construed as a signal that the problems faced by the financial firms may slowly be disappearing and therefore, traders were encouraged to buy financial stocks, extending a rally in the space from Monday, following months of underperformance.  The major averages opened higher and rallied sharply in early trading before showing a steady advance over the rest of the session to end with handsome gains. The Dow Industrials gained 379.44 points or 5.80% at close at 6,927, its highest level in a week and recording the biggest 1-day percentage gain since November 21st, 2008.  While the Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 89.64 points or 7.07% to 1,358, the S&amp;P 500 Index rose 43.07 points or 6.37% to 720.  All thirty of the Dow components ended the session higher, with the gains paced by Citi, which rallied 38.10%. JP Morgan Chase (JPM) soared 22.64%, Bank of America (BAC) jumped 27.73% and General Electric (GE) surged up 19.70%, while Alcoa (AA) (up 13.54%), American Express (AXP) (up 14.38%), Caterpillar (CAT) (up 10.83%), DuPont (DD) (up 11.03%) and General Motors (GM) (up 12.50%) were among the other significant gainers.  Among the sector indexes, the KBW Bank Index rallied 15.56% and the Amex Securities Broker/Dealer Index climbed 14.71%. The Dow Jones Transportation Average moved up 7.21% compared to an 8.43% advance by the Amex Airline Index. The S&amp;P Retail Index and the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index gained 7.74% and 12.71%, respectively.  The Amex Oil Index ended up 5.59% and the Philadelphia Oil Service Index rose 6.39%. Among the technology sub indexes, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained 8.07% and the Amex Disk Drive Index rallied 11.44%, while the Amex Computer Hardware Index, the Amex Software Index and the Amex Internet Index rallied over 7% each. On the other hand, the Amex Gold Bugs Index receded 5.91%.  With yesterday's rally, the CBOE Volatility Index, which began a short-term uptrend following a retreat in late January, has been pushed back to a narrow sideways channel. If the index tests a support around the 43.50, we may be in for a period of reduced volatility in the days ahead. On the upside, the index has resistance around 49.60.  On the economic front, the Commerce Department said wholesale inventories at the end of January declined 0.7%, marking the fourth straight month of declines. The drop in inventories reflected large declines in automobile and computers in the durable goods category and drugs and groceries in the non-durable goods category. Wholesale sales fell a steeper 2.9%. Consequently, the wholesale inventories to sales ratio rose to 1.30 from 1.27, marking the highest since level since January 2002.  In his address on Tuesday, Bernanke called for overhauling the rules for biggest financial firms. While suggesting that the U.S. will ensure the capital adequacy of banks, he also reiterated that the Fed should have a role in broader risk management. In a question &amp; answer session that followed, Bernanke said he wouldn't support suspending mark-to-market accounting standards, but he is not against making improvements so that marks at fire price sales do not unnecessarily worsen market swings.  Despite all hopes of a bottom being near, not many are optimistic of a turnaround in economic conditions in the near term. IHS Global Insight expects the fourth quarter and first quarter show back-to-back declines in real GDP of more than 6% at an annual rate. Therefore, the peak-to-trough drop in GDP is expected at 4.8%. The firm estimates that GPD will decline by 3.7% in 2009 and the unemployment rate will peak at 10.3% in the first half of 2010. Currency, Commodity Markets Crude oil futures are trading down $0.56 at $45.15 a barrel after receding $0.80 to $45.71 a barrel on Tuesday.

At the same time, the dollar is valued at $1.2794 versus the euro compared to yesterday's $1.2682. Asia The major markets across Asia-Pacific region advanced on Wednesday on hopes that the global banking sector will recover earlier than expected after Citibank CEO Vikram Pandit said on Tuesday that the bank made a profit in the first two months of 2009 and is poised to report better results for the first quarter. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's assertion that large banks would not be allowed to fail also lifted the sentiment.  Banking stocks led the gains across the markets. Mining stocks also advanced after the commodity prices rose on the London Metal Exchange. However, mixed economic data from China raised fresh concerns. While Fixed Asset Investment in China rose sharply, aided partially by the stimulus plans, exports from the country declined sharply by more than 25% during February following an 18% drop in January, raising doubts about whether the growth story of the Chinese economy will fizzle out or not be sustained. The Chinese Shanghai composite index discounted the weak economic data and closed negative, bucking the uptrend in the rest of the major markets in the region.  The markets in India were shut for a public holiday.   In Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 Index surged up 321 points or 4.6% to close at 7,376. Banking stocks led the rally in the market.

Toshiba shares surged up 9.50% after a business daily reported that the company will likely secure an operating profit of about 100 billion yen for the year ending March 2010, rebounding from the 280 billion yen operating loss expected this fiscal year.  Seiko Epson rose 6% on news that it plans to consolidate three production bases of LCD panel subsidiary Epson Imaging Devices into one by September and stop production at a chip making plant as early as 2011 as part of its restructuring.

In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng Index gained 2% or 237 points to close at 11,931.

In Seoul, the benchmark KOSPI index advanced 3.23% or 35 points to close at 1,128. Banks, commodities and exporters led the gains. A sharp appreciation in the local currency against the U.S greenback and a foreign buying spree also lifted the market sentiment.  Among the other markets, Malaysia's KLSE Composite Index ended down 5 points to 855. Singapore's Strait Times Index advanced 1.33% to 1505, while Taiwan's Weighed Index gained about 1.9% or 89 points to 4760.
