THE Australian share market oscillated between positive and negative territory at noon as investors retreated to the sidelines.  At noon the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 0.2 points, or 0.01 per cent, at 3,154.7, while the broader All Ordinaries index lost 4.7 points, or 0.15 per cent, to 3,117.0.   On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was seven points, or 0.22 per cent, higher at 3,156 on a volume of 10,560 contracts.   Trading volumes were 'unbelievably poor' with only $1 billion in turnover by noon, Burrell Stockbroking associate Peter Wright said. 'I've seen $1 billion (in turnover) done by 1010 AEDT,' Mr Wright said. 'There's a stalemate. 'Everyone is sitting on the sidelines, and anyone who wants to sell has sold.' Uncertainty continues to plague financial stocks, he said.   Australia's major lenders were mostly stronger, with Commonwealth Bank gaining 93 cents, or 3.49 per cent, to $27.57, ANZ Banking Group adding 17 cents, or 1.36 per cent, to $12.70 and Westpac putting on 27 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to $16.17.   National Australia Bank was steady at $16.03.   QBE Insurance added 50 cents, or 3.21 per cent, to $16.10 on profit taking and short covering, Mr Burrell said.   Investors were using derivatives and other avenues to bypass the ban on shorting financial stocks, he said.
