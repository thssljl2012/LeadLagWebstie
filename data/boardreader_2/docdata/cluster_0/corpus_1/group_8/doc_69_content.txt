(Adds information, quotes, updates/adds market levels) SINGAPORE (MarketWatch) -- Asian share markets were solidly higher Wednesday after a rally on Wall Street, with sentiment improving further for beaten-down financial stocks. Analysts though were cautious on the durability of the move, and markets in Asia certainly weren't matching the gains seen in the U.S., with U.S. stock futures largely flat in screen trade. 'Rallies in equity markets overnight are being extended in Asia and are valid reason for investor cheer when good news has been hard to come by of late. (Still), we don't believe the last couple of sessions will have marked a turning point - the global economy is far from out of the woods,' said Societe Generale strategist Patrick Bennett. Japan's Nikkei 225 was the best performer, after declines in the earlier part of the week, rising 4.0%. South Korea's Kospi Composite was 2.8% higher with Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 up 2.3%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index up 3.7%, Taiwan's main index up 2.1%, and shares in Shanghai 0.5% higher. Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 5.8% in its biggest point and percentage gain since late November, led by a rally in financial stocks. Still, 'there are still some serious issues we need to work through, so I would caution against getting too bullish on the back of one big night in the U.S.,' said City Index market strategist Alex Douglas. Among financial stocks in Asia, ANZ Bank was up 3.4% with Commonwealth Bank of Australia up 3.9% and Macquarie 4.9% higher. Japan's Mizuho FG added 7.8% with Sumitomo Mitsui FG up 5.2% and insurer Tokio Marine up 7.9%, while Korea's KB Financial gained 6.2%. In Singapore, DBS rose 5.5% with OCBC up 2.7% and UOB rising 3.5%. HSBC was up 6.6%, extending a recovery from its recent slide which came on news of a planned rights offer. Other banks in Hong Kong were higher: Standard Chartered was up 6.7%, Fubon Bank up 3.4%, Hang Seng Bank up 5.3% and Bank of East Asia gained 5.1%. There was some fallout in the real estate sector in Tokyo after Pacific Holdings said it had filed for court-led rehabilitation with liabilities totaling Y163.65 billion due to fund-raising problems. Nippon Residential Investment was ask-only with the company managed by Pacific Residential, whose major shareholder is Pacific Holdings. But Toshiba jumped 7.7% after the Nikkei reported it was likely to post a group operating profit of about Y100 billion for the year ending March 2010, rebounding from the Y280 billion operating loss expected this fiscal year. China shares were led higher by financial stocks and steel companies, which were being bid up on expectations of an export tax rebate. Still, 'sentiment remains cautious as more macroeconomic data will come out this week,' said Zhang Gang at Southwest Securities. Citic Securities was up 3.9%, Shenzhen Development Bank up 2.7% and Baoshan Iron &amp; Steel 4.4% higher. Australian commodity stocks rose with BHP Billiton up 4.6%, Fortescue adding 4.6% and Rio Tinto 3.1% higher, though gold miners were hit by Tuesday's decline in the price of gold, with Newcrest down 2.1% and Lihir off 6.6%. New Zealand shares were 1.5% higher, led by stocks hurt last month by balance sheet worries, with Fisher &amp; Paykel Appliances up 5.9% and Nuplex up 4.9%. A fall in the U.S. dollar against the won helped some Korean stocks as it would make repayment of dollar-denominated debt easier, with Posco up 4.0%, Korean Air up 3.4% and Hyundai Heavy up 4.6%. The dollar fell against the won to KRW1,482, from KRW1,511.5 Tuesday. Malaysia's benchmark index was 0.6% higher, though not getting much help from news late Tuesday of the government's larger-than-expected MYR60 billion economic stimulus package. Philippine's main index was up 2.3% with Singapore's Straits Times Index 1.6% higher, Indonesian shares up 0.9% and Thai shares up 1.1%. In currency markets the euro was still higher against the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen, amid a better appetite for risk, though it was off its early peaks. The single currency was at $1.2711, from $1.2657 late in New York, and at Y125.09, from Y124.94. The U.S. dollar was around Y98.40, from Y98.74. Risker currencies like the Australian dollar were buoyed with the currency recently around US$0.6470. Rising stocks pushed bonds down with lead Japanese government bond futures slipping 0.12 to 138.48 points. There was also a tightening in the cost of protection on Asia's U.S. dollar bonds, with the Markit iTraxx Asia ex-Japan high-yield CDS index around 25 basis points tighter, from 451.5 basis points Tuesday. Spot gold was on the back foot after sinking below the $900 troy ounce level Tuesday. The metal was recently at 893.55, down $3.75 from New York, while LME three-month copper was down $20 from London, at $3,700 a metric ton. April Nymex crude oil futures were up 13 cents at $45.84 a barrel on Globex, after a $1.36 fall in New York.
