Stock markets sold off across the board today with financials especially hard-hit on U.S. downgrade worries while there was a sense of letdown that the Chinese government hasn't unveiled fresh stimulus measures.  There were also renewed worries about the future of General Motors Corp. Toronto's S&amp;P/TSX composite index lost Wednesday's 183-point advance, falling 185.58 points to 7,629.17.  Investors had waded back into the market on hopes that China would use the start of the National People's Congress' annual session to announce new economic measures, in addition to the US$585 billion in spending outlined in November.  But Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said today the government would help the world's third-largest economy grow by eight per cent this year, but stopped short of promising new measures. 'The Chinese have been doing things; they are the most aggressive and proactive country of significance in the world trying to get their economy going,' said Paul Thornton, investment adviser at Global Maxfin Capital. 'But the fact that a day later 'Oh, it's not happening, we were wrong and all that stuff' ...the market is really trying to grasp at anything to make itself feel better.' The TSX Venture Exchange slipped 1.26 points to 829.69 while the Canadian dollar fell 0.79 cent to 77.62 cents US. New York's Dow Jones industrials dropped 281.4 points to 6,594.44 following a 150-point advance. General Motors' annual report said its auditors have raised ''substantial doubt' about the troubled automaker's ability to continue operations, and the company said it may have to seek bankruptcy protection if it can't execute a huge restructuring plan. GM shares dropped 34 cents to US$1.86 on the New York Stock Exchange. 'Anybody who has been watching has been kind of expecting this to happen and it only intensifies the debate about whether or not they should be getting bailed out,' added Thornton. The Nasdaq composite index gave back 54.15 points to 1,299.59 and the S&amp;P 500 index moved down 30.32 points to 682.55.  There was also February retail data from the U.S. to chew over. The figures weren't as dismal as in January, and Wal-Mart's gains far outpaced expectations.  Wal-Mart also announced it is hiking its annual dividend 15 per cent to US$1.09 a share and its shares ran ahead $1.31 to US$49.80 .

(TSX: ECA) surrendered $1.71 to $48.56.  Investors also took in earnings reports from some of the oilpatch's heavyweights while another company filed for creditor protection.  Natural gas explorer and producer Canadian Superior Energy Inc. (TSX: SNG) says it has filed an application with the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta for protection from creditors under the federal Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. Its shares plunged 20 cents to 29 cents and the TSX said it is 'reviewing the common shares of the company with respect to meeting the continued listing requirements.' Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.
