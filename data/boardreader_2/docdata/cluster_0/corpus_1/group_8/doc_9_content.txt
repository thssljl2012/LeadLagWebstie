SYDNEY, March 11 (Reuters) - Australian stocks rose 1.8 percent to a one-week high on Wednesday, as financial stocks such as Macquarie Group Ltd jumped after Citigroup announced it was profitable in the first two months of 2009. Miners such as BHP Billiton Ltd and Rio Tinto Ltd also got a boost from strong metal prices, but gold miners fell as bullion prices slipped when investors switched out of the safe-haven metal. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 index rose 57.9 points to 3,242.4 points by 2358 GMT, its highest level since March 3, and adding to Tuesday's 1 percent rise. The comments by Citi (see) helped the Dow Jones jump 5.8 percent and gave U.S. stocks their best day in four months. 'Today is the first good day for a long period. You would like to think it's sustainable...it has been sold off for a while,' said Dean Fergie, managing director of funds manager Opis Capital. The index, which tumbled 41.3 percent last year, is down about 13 percent in 2009 and fell to a five-year low last week. The market mood was also supported by news that a key measure of Australian consumer confidence fared better than expected. For details:. New Zealand shares also climbed, with the benchmark NZX-50 index up 1.6 percent at 2,501.9 points.
