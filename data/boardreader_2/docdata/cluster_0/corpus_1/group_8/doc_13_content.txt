 (RTTNews) - Canadian stocks will likely track equity markets abroad sharply lower Monday morning amid lingering concerns about Wall Street financials and the depth of the global recession.  The S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index gained 63.8 points or 0.78% on Friday, ending the session at 8,123.02. A week ago, Toronto's main index set a six-year closing low, and may test that level barring a change of mood on Bay Street.  US markets were poised to kick off March on a characteristically dismal note, with the Dow set to open below 7,000 after insurance giant AIG received another lifeline in the form of as much $30 billion in new government capital, just after posting a record quarterly loss.  AIG reported fourth quarter net loss of $61.7 billion or $22.95 per share, compared to a net loss of $5.3 billion or $2.08 per share in the year-ago quarter.  Global stocks have been hammered on Monday. In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei index and the Hang Seng of Hong Kong fell 3.8 percent. European indexes were down more than 3 percent in early trading.  Back on Bay Street, traders were looking ahead to fourth quarter Canadian GDP data, set for release at 8:30 am ET. Economists were predicting an 3.5-per-cent drop on a yearly basis.  On the earnings front, traders will take in quarterly results from embattled Nortel Networks (NT.TO), Pengrowth Energy Trust, and Vermillion Energy Trust.  Looking ahead, on Tuesday the Bank of Canada will make its latest interest rate announcement. Economists expect the central bank to slash its key overnight rate to 0.5 percent from 1 percent.  by RTT Staff Writer  For comments and feedback: contact editorial@rttnews.com
