LOCAL shares pared steep losses this afternoon, as investors bet on the Reserve Bank cutting interest rates by 25 basis points. Picture: Bob Finlayson Financial markets have fully priced in a 0.25 percentage point cut and anything less than that could see the Australian stock market fall sharply.   The RBA will announce its decision at 2.30pm AEDT.   ABN Amro head of sales trading Justin Gallagher said: The market is rallying on the basis of a 25 basis point cut. If we dont get that we will probably see the market turnaround quite quickly. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 was down 50.3 points, or 1.6 per cent, at 3199.8 after breaking through the previous five-year low and key technical level of 3217.5.   It had touched an intraday low of 3153.5 earlier in the session.   The All Ordinaries was down 50.9 points at 3152.9. Asian markets also opened lower, with Japans Nikkei 225 Index down 1.7 per cent.  was back above US63 cents after falling as low as US62.87c this morning. The local unit yesterday closed at US63.35c.   Investors believe 3000 is the next key technical level for the S&amp;P/ASX 200 and a fall below this would force a readjustment in the worst-case-scenario level, currently 2800.   A sell-off in US and European markets and sharp falls in commodity prices set the negative tone for local shares.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.2 per cent to below 7000 points after insurance giant AIG reported the biggest loss in US corporate history, while data showed manufacturing activity deteriorated in February.   The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index shed 5 per cent, with the banking sector losing nearly 10 per cent after HSBC announced plans to raise $27.7 billion through a deeply discounted rights issue.   HSBC shares plunged 19 per cent.   BHP Billiton fell 60c, or 2.15 per cent, to $27.35, while Rio Tinto lost 78c, or 1.76 per cent, to $43.45.   National Australia Bank lost 10c, or 0.57 per cent, to $17.41, Commonwealth Bank shed 57c, or 2 per cent, to $27.94, Westpac sank 19c, or 1.17 per cent, to $16.11, and ANZ was down 7c, or 0.53 per cent, to $13.03.   Suncorp Metway shares lost 15c, or 3.18 per cent, to $4.56 on a downgrade by Moody's Investor Services to the bank's long-term deposit and debt ratings. Across the board, we are down but as the day goes on there are a few glimmers of hope, ABN AMRO Morgan's director of equities, Bill Chatterton said. Toll Holdings is quite strong and has a good balance sheet, he said. Toll added 22c, or 4.19 per cent, to $5.47, while Brambles put on 18c, or 4.2 per cent, to $4.47.   CSL gained $1.25, or 3.63 per cent, to $35.70.   Additional reporting: AAP
