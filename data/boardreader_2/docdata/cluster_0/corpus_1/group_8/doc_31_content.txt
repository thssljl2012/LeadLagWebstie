The Australian stock market was higher at noon, amid a quiet session due to a public holiday in Victoria, as mining giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto led the way.  At 1200 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was up 24.6 points, or 0.78 per cent, at 3,170.1, while the broader All Ordinaries index gained 24.3 points to 3,136.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was 21 points higher at 3,167 on a volume of 10,013 contracts. 'BHP and Rio are up quite a lot which is driving market,' Wilson HTM client adviser Joseph Pagliaro said. 'Otherwise, its pretty uneventful with Victoria out.' Victoria was marking the Labour Day public holiday on Monday.  BHP Billiton, the biggest company on the stock exchange, rose $1.50, or 5.42 per cent, to $29.15 and rival Rio Tinto gained $2.23, or 4.88 per cent, to $47.93.  Copper prices rose on Friday to take the weekly gain to nearly 10 per cent, as another drop in stockpiles resuscitated hopes of a demand pick-up in China.  Copper for May delivery in New York rose 3.55 cents to close at $1.6890 a pound.  Gold and oil also gained.  Rio also said on Monday that further development of the Oyu Tolgoi joint venture in Mongolia needs to be carefully planned amid the economic downturn, as the company awaits an investment agreement from the government.  Energy stocks rose after crude oil gained on Friday as US oil inventories fell.  Light, sweet crude for April delivery rose $US1.91 to settle at $US45.52 in New York.  Santos gained 44 cents, or 2.89 per cent, to $15.64, Woodside added 60 cents to $36.15 and Oil Search gained six cents to $4.87.  The spot price of gold in Sydney was $US938.4 per fine ounce, up $US0.25 on Friday's local close of $US938.15.  Gold miner Newcrest advanced 88 cents to $31.95, Newmont Mining fell 26 cents to $5.90, Lihir Gold was flat at $3.15.  The banking sector was mixed with National Australia Bank falling 43 cents, or 2.56 per cent, to $16.37 and Commonwealth Bank declining 14 cents to $26.86. Westpac rose 16 cents to $15.86 and ANZ added 11 cents to $12.47.  Meanwhile, the insurers fell again, with QBE losing 78 cents, or 4.79 per cent, to $15.52, Insurance Australia Group declining 12 cents, or 3.73 per cent, to $3.10 and AMP slipping 12 cents, or 3.13 per cent, to $3.71. 'With what happened with AIG (US insurance giant American International Group, which was taken over by the government), our insurers are being slammed,' Wilson HTM's Mr Pagliaro said.  2009 AAP Brought to you by
