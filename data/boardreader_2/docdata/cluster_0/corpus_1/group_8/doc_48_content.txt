THE Australian share market closed at fresh five-year lows yesterday, pulled down by miners and financials, amid fears the economy is heading for recession. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index fell 52.8 points, or 1.64 per cent, to 3166.4, while the broader All Ordinaries shed 45.5 points, or 1.43 per cent, to 3125.9. S&amp;P/200 index was last at this level in August 2003. 'Today's GDP number reinforced that we are heading for a recession of some sort, so the market remained in negative territory after opening lower following a fall in the US overnight,' CMC Markets senior dealer Dominic Vaughan said. 'The financials were sold heavily early on but regained some traction,' he said. 'Negative sentiment still weighs on this market across most sectors, and today's GDP number reinforced that it is going to be another difficult six months for Australian companies.' GDP fell for the first time in eight years, dropping by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent in the December quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday.   Overnight on Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 37.27 points, or 0.55percent, at 6726.02, and the local market responded by opening down almost 2 per cent.   Among the banks, ANZ shed 51cents to $12.45, Commonwealth Bank fell $1.02 to $27.27, National Australia Bank lost 12c to $17.20 and Westpac fell 37c to $15.70.   The mining sector retreat was led by BHP Billiton, down 18c to $27.11, and Rio Tinto, off 55c to $43.47.   Rio Tinto says shareholder opposition to Chinalco's investment in the company is waning, and the miner has left the door open to a future iron ore partnership with former suitor BHP Billiton. Murchison Metals gained 8.5c to 65.5c after China's Sinosteel Corporation increased its stake in the iron ore junior.   Spot gold ended at $US912.25 an ounce, down $US14.75 on Tuesday's local close of $US927 an ounce.   Lihir Gold said it planned to raise $US325 million ($507 million) to accelerate an expansion of its namesake goldmine in Papua New Guinea and to fund growth opportunities in West Africa.   Among retailers, Woolworths shed 32c to $26.50, Wesfarmers fell 94c to $16.68, David Jones lost 8c to $2.10 and Harvey Norman dipped 1.5c to $1.95.   Among media stocks, Consolidated Media Holdings fell 1.5c to $1.935, Fairfax lost 3.5c to 83.5c, and News Corporation shed 23c to $9.53 while its non-voting shares lost 17c to $8.38.   The energy sector was weaker. Woodside fell 52c to $33.71, Santos lost 27c to $14.48 and Oil Search off 3c to $4.77.   However, Arrow Energy put on 10c to $2.53 after the company said it would continue to assess its takeover of Pure Energy Ltd after its partner Royal Dutch Shell accepted a rival bid for the coal seam gas group.   Telstra was the most traded stock by volume, with 78.879million shares worth $266.26 million changing hands as the price fell 7c, or 2.03 per cent, to $3.37.
