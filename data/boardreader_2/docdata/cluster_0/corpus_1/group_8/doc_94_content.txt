At 1017 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 had gained 48.9 points, or 1.34 per cent, at 3,695.5, while the broader All Ordinaries added 47.7 points, or 1.33 per cent, to 3,634.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the June share price index contract was trading up 40 points at 3,705 on volume of 5,492 contracts.  BHP Billiton, which makes up about 12 per cent of the All Ords index, advanced 50 cents, or 1.5 per cent, to $34.28. Rival Rio Tinto gained $1.91, or 3.5 per cent, to $56.61 and iron ore miner Fortescue increased 12 cents, or 4.9 per cent, to $2.59.  The big four banks, together worth about 20 per cent of the All Ords, added to market gains. Westpac rose 12 cents to $19.72, Commonwealth Bank added 64 cent to $35.39, National Australia Bank increased 23 cents to $21.22 and ANZ gained 14 cents to $16.94.  Wall Street rosed overnight after Best Buy Co, ConAgra Foods Inc, and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc all turned in quarterly reports that beat analysts' expectations.  Strong demand for US government debt at the Treasury Department's latest auction also lifted stocks.  The Dow Jones industrial average gained 2.25 per cent to 7,924.56. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rose 2.33 per cent to 832.86 and the Nasdaq composite index added 3.80 per cent to 1,587.00.  Cameron Securities client adviser Adrian Leppinus said investors were starting to think that the bottom had been reached.  'There will be pull backs because the current rise can't be sustained, but when there are, people will come in to buy stocks,' he said.  Mr Leppinus said that investors were now willing to believe companies with better outlook statements.  'Best Buy's result was ordinary but the outlook was hopeful,' he said.  The coal miners had done well on rumours that the coal prices were being settled at rates above market expectations, Mr Leppinus said.  MacArthur Coal gained 25 cents, or 6.4 per cent, to $4.13, New Hope added seven cents to $3.99 and Felix resources rose 35 cents, or 3.7 per cent, to $9.75.  Another stock to add to the market gains was QBE Insurance which rose 92 cents, or 4.8 per cent, to $20.26.  Some of the property trusts also performed well, with Stockland rising 21 censt, or 7.1 per cent, to $3.18, GPT adding three cents, or 7.6 per cent, to 42.5 cents and Mirvac gaining 6.5 cents, or 7.6 per cent, to 92.5 cents.
