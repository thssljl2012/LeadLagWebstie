 (RTTNews) - The major markets across the Asia-pacific region are trading higher on Friday morning, taking cues from Wall Street, where the markets ended higher, led by technology stocks on increasing optimism that the efforts initiated by the U.S. Government will help in reviving the economy earlier than expected. Some degree of profit taking is also being witnessed in the markets after a strong rally in the past few trading sessions.  On Thursday, the Dow closed up 174.75 points or 2.3% at 7,925, the Nasdaq closed up 58.05 points or 3.8% at 1,587 and the S&amp;P 500 closed up 18.98 points or 2.3% at 833.  In the U.S, investors were encouraged by better-than-expected earnings from big consumer brands and strong demand for government debt at the Treasury Department's auction of $24 billion worth of seven-year notes that helped to ease some of the recent concerns about the government's ability to fund its economic stimulus programs.  Despite broader weakness in the U.S. economy, hopes of recovery are slowly replacing the outright pessimistic outlook about the strength of the economy and the market sentiment is changing for the better.
