 SYDNEY, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar pulled away from recent seven-month lows on Wednesday, supported by a rebound in commodity prices and a lower U.S. currency which took a breather from a rally that has lifted it to multi-month highs. * The benchmark CRB commodities index  rose 1.08 percent on Tuesday on the back of a rally in crude oil and gold prices . Australia is a big exporter of resources and the Aussie has been undermined by views that a global economic slowdown would hurt demand for commodities in the coming months. * Aussie seen capped by expectations of a rate cut next month. Minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) Aug. 5 policy meeting released on Tuesday showed the board saw a case for an early easing in monetary policy given an unwarranted tightening in financial market conditions, slowing demand and a bleak global outlook. * By 9:40 a.m. (2340 GMT), the Australian dollar  was at $ 0.8724/26 against the U.S. dollar, up from $0.8652/53 late here on Tuesday, and pulling away from a seven-month low at $0.8590 struck on Aug. 13. * The Aussie inched up to 95.65 yen , from 95.43 yen, but investors remained wary of large positions amid fresh risk aversion and expectations of rate cuts by the RBA. A cut in interest rates will diminish the Aussie's high-yield allure. * Markets  are fully pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut when the central bank's board meets on Sept. 2. * Australian bonds were firmer, buoyed by prospects for rate cuts and safe-haven inflows. Three-year bond futures  were up 0.005 points at 94.335, while the 10-year bond contract  added 0.015 points to 94.235.
