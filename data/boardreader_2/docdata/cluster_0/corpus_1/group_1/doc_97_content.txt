 AUSTRALIAN stocks ended flat on a weak trading day after banks incurred further losses and miners gained marginally. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 closed 3.7 points, or 0.07 per cent, higher at 5011.2, while the broader All Ordinaries added 5.5 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 5087.8. At 1615 AEST on the Sydney Futures Exchange, the September share price index contract was 11 points higher at 4997 on a volume of 22,502 contracts. CMC Markets senior dealer Analyst Dominic Vaughan said Macquarie Group led the financials down after a broking house downgraded the investment bank. There were also concerns the high-profile investor may have to write down or sell off assets. 'There's risk aversion among those stocks,'' he said. Mixed base metal prices overnight had done little to boost the resources sector. Macquarie Group slumped $4.44, or 9.64 per cent, to $41.61. The banks were poorer. ANZ was down four cents to $16.08, Commonwealth Bank fell 72 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to $41.63, National Australia Bank shed four cents to $23.86 and Westpac was off five cents to $22.70. The major miners made slight gains. BHP Billiton improved 14 cents, or 0.34 per cent, to $40.89, while takeover target Rio Tinto added 94 cents, or 0.76 per cent, to $125.00. Share this article
