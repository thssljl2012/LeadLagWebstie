 ANZ has pledged to pass in full to its home loan customers any rate cut the Reserve Bank decides at its next board meeting.The ANZ pledge comes a day after rival National Australia Bank promised to match a 25 basis point cut to interest rates if the RBA eases monetary policy by that amount at its September 2 board meeting. 'It's unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today, this is a pretty simple equation,' ANZ boss Mike Smith said today. 'If funding costs continue at the current levels and the Reserve Bank do actually cut rates, then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers.'
