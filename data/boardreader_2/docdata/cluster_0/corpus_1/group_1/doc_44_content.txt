 SYDNEY, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Job advertisements in Australian newspapers and on the Internet dipped in July, pointing to a moderate easing in strong jobs growth in coming months, a survey showed on Monday.The total number of job advertisements fell 0.3 percent in July to an average 261,936 a week, on top of a 3.0 percent drop in June. Ads were still 5.5 percent higher than in July last year, according to the survey from Australia and New Zealand Banking Corp . The survey showed the number of job advertisements in major metropolitan newspapers fell 5.1 percent in July to 15,739 per week, leaving them 21.7 percent lower on July last year.Internet job advertisments were stable in July at an average 246,197 per week. That was 7.9 percent up on the same month of 2007. 'The overall trend in job advertisements continues to weaken, indicative of a softening in hiring intentions across Australia in 2008,' said Warren Hogan, head of Australian economics at ANZ.The labour market has been resilient in recent months despite steep falls in consumption and business confidence. Firms still report difficulty in finding enough skilled workers, suggesting they will be reluctant to let people go even as the economy slows.Still, leading indicators of employment, including the advertisement series, have been pointing to a drop-off in hiring.The government's monthly report on employment is due on Thursday and analysts are looking for only a marginal rise of 1,250 in July, with the jobless rate ticking up to 4.3 percent.(Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by James Thornhill) . ngInteractive Investor brings you breaking news throughout the day to support your investment decisions.
