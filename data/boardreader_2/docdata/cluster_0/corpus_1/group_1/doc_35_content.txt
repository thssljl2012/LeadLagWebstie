 SYDNEY, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 1.4 percent on Tuesday as concerns about slowing global demand hit oil and metals prices, sparking steep declines in heavyweight resource firms such as BHP Billiton Ltd . The benchmark index  ended off earlier lows, buoyed by rate-sensitive banking shares which extended gains after the Australian central bank said slowing demand meant there could be scope to lower rates in the months ahead [ID:nSYD197756].Analysts said while a drop in energy costs eased worries about rising inflation, it had also fuelled worries that weakening demand for commodities would hurt the resource-heavy Australian market. 'At the moment, people are taking the view that the glass is half-empty, rather than half-full,' said Greg Goodsell, equity strategist at ABN AMRO. 'Rather than looking on the positive side, that weaker commodities take the pressure off inflation, people are seeing it as a product of slower growth.' Other market analysts said, while it was not all doom and gloom for equity markets, ongoing concerns about credit market losses will continue to keep investors on edge. 'Some of the headwinds that we've faced in recent months are actually turning around. We've got the oil price coming off and it looks like interest rates (here) have peaked,' said Eric Betts, equities strategist at Nomura Australia. 'Those are reasons to be a little less negative on corporate profits.' 'But the subprime crisis is still lurking in the background, ready to deal its deadly blows on unwary people.' The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index  fell 67.3 points to 4,820.4, based on the latest available data. The index had fallen as much as 2.6 percent earlier, hitting its lowest since June 2006.The index has now dropped nearly 24 percent since the start of the year after rising 11.8 percent in 2007.New Zealand's benchmark NZX-50 index  fell 0.7 percent, or 23.54 points, to 3,295.68.
