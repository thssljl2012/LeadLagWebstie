 The Australian Industry Group - PricewaterhouseCoopers manufacturing index shows the country's factories are wilting under the pressure of higher rates and a stronger Australian dollar.The index registered 46.9 points in July, little changed from 47 points last month, but remained below the 50-point threshold that separates expansion from contraction. The reading is the lowest since November 2005 when the index dipped to 44.8 points.''The continuing weakness of manufacturing activity is not surprising given that the sector, and the economy more generally, is feeling the ongoing impacts of the Reserve Bank's tightening of monetary policy as well as market based rate rises,' said Australian Industry Group chief executive Heather Ridout in a statement.July outcomes show shrinking production, orders and employment levels, she said. A run-down in manufacturing inventories suggests a continuation in weak demand and further possible falls in production, Mr Ridout noted.'This, together with another fall in new orders, indicates that activity will continue to be soft in the near term,'' Mrs Ridout said.Rate relief delay?Even if the markets are correct in pricing in a November cut in official rates, there's no guarantee commercial banks will pass on the whole cut -- if they reduce rates at all.Commercial banks piled on another 60 basis points to their interest rates this year, in addition to the RBA's two rate increases, blaming the higher cost of raising funds amid the global credit crisis.In the past couple of weeks, ANZ and National Australia Bank have increased their write-downs, indicating they would be looking to repair their profit levels, an effort that would be aided by delaying the passing on of any RBA rate cut.In other words, household budgets already under strain from soaring food and fuel prices are likely to get little relief beyond the tax cuts introduced on July 1.That said, official rates when they start to fall, may drop steadily, so that rate relief for borrowers would not be too far behind the RBA's first move, according to Lehman Brothers economist Stephen Roberts.'When we look out over the next few months, rates will come down and come down a fair way,' he said. 'The missing point in all the noise going on about the first rate cut is that there is going to be a lot of them.'No matter when the RBA acts on rates, the softening economic data will be noted by the central bank.''At the very least, the RBA is likely to spend more time in August's accompanying policy statement discussing the growing downside risk to Australian economic growth,'' said TD Securities' Mr Williamson, referring to the RBA's next board meeting on August 5, when no rates change is expected.
