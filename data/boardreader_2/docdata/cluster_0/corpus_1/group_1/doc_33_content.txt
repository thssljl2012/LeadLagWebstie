 SYDNEY, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Australian investment firm Babcock&amp;amp;Brown Ltd (News)  said on Monday full-year 2008 earnings would not exceed the A$643 million ($569 million) reported in 2007 due to difficult market conditions, sending its shares down over 9 percent. It had previously said it expected 2008 profit of around A$750 million depending on market conditions. It also said on Monday that first-half net profit after tax is expected to be 25 percent to 40 percent below the A$250 million reported in the first half of 2007. 'The volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult,' Chief Executive Phil Green said in a statement. Babcock&amp;amp;Brown's shares fell as much as 9.4 percent after the announcement, and were down 9.1 percent at 0154 GMT, in a wider market that was up 0.7 percent. Many of Australia's major banks and financial firms are under scrutiny after National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB)  and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ)  issued profit warnings, shaking confidence in their ability to weather the credit crunch. Babcock&amp;amp;Brown said the cut in its profit outlook was primarily due to non-cash impairment provisions, particularly in real estate, as well as other corporate&amp;amp;structured finance assets. It will give more detail on the 2008 outlook when it reports its first-half results on Aug. 21.(Reporting by Mette Fraende).ngCOPYRIGHTCopyright Thomson Financial News Limited 2008.
