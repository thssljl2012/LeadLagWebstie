 SYDNEY, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Australian shares edged up 0.1 percent on Monday as financial firms such as Macquarie Group  recovered from the previous session's sell-off, while rising oil prices lifted energy firms.However, growing concerns that a faltering U.S. economy would dent demand for commodities pressured the top miners, while Lend Lease Corp Ltd  dropped on a profit warning, keeping a lid on gains.Market analysts said sentiment was fragile, with concerns about a U.S. recession, high energy costs and slowing company profits remaining key worries for equity markets. 'The still-high oil price, slowing growth virtually everywhere, profit downgrades, inflation worries and the continuing credit crunch are all big short-term headwinds for shares and are likely to ensure a rough ride,' said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital Investors.Adding to signs the U.S. housing slump and high oil prices were hurting the broader economy, General Motors , the top U.S. automaker, posted a $15.5 billion quarterly loss, while a report showed that U.S. jobless rate jumped to a four-year high in July.
