 Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan says National Australia Bank's promise to pass on a future interest rate cut is a major victory for commonsense.NAB chief executive Ahmed Farhour has promised the bank will pass on a 0.25 per cent cut to customers if the Reserve Bank reduces the official cash rate by that amount.He says NAB can afford the cut because the Reserve Bank has strongly signalled it is finished lifting rates.Mr Swan says the other banks should follow suit. 'The NAB has made a very good start today, they made a public commitment to officially reduce rates if official rates are cut,' he said. 'This decision by the NAB now throws down the challenge to all the other banks. 'Other banks should have a good hard look at themselves and look at what the NAB has done. NAB's announcement makes it the first major bank to promise consumers the benefit of any Reserve Bank rate cut.Other banks including Westpac, St George Bank, the ANZ and the Commonwealth Bank have all stood firm against passing on a rates cut, despite significant pressure to do so.Opposition Leader Brendan Nelson says the banks could cut their rates by more than the Reserve rate and he argued they might be able to bring their rates down immediately. 'We know that banks have had to pay more for money over the last six to eight months as a result of the global liquidity crisis,' he said. 'We know that but we also know their margins are extraordinarily healthy and with the coming off of pressure on the price they're paying for money I think they're in a position to pass it on now.'
