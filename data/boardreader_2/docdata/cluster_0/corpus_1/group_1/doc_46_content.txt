 SYDNEY -(Dow Jones)- Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) Chief Executive Mike Smith said Friday that there will be a 'full flow on' to customers of any rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia.The RBA is expected to lower rates 25 basis points at its September meeting but a key cog in an easing cycle will be whether or not retail banks pass on any cuts to customers, analysts say. 'It's unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today, this is a pretty simple equation. If funding costs continue at the current levels and the Reserve Bank do actually cut rates, then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers,' Smith said in an interview, according to ANZ.On Thursday, National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) pledged to pass on,in full, any 25 basis point cut by the central bank at its September meeting. -By Enda Curran, Dow Jones Newswires;61-2-8235-2958; enda.curran@dowjones.comClick here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http:// www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=YInBTselDPW8Kpy5l0wZWw%3D%3D.
