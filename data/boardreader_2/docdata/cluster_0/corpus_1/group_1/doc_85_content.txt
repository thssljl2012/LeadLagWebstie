 SHANGHAI/PERTH, Aug 18 (Reuters) - China's coal exports could fall further in September as higher export taxes take effect, pushing up international prices and giving Australian producers a stronger hand in upcoming contract negotiations.China, the world's largest producer and consumer of coal, on Friday said it would impose an export tax of 10 percent on thermal coal starting Aug. 20, as it seeks to ease a severe power shortage that has forced half the nation to ration electricity.'The move will greatly reduce exports on the spot market. Besides the term contracts, there will be very little exports.' said Judy Zhu, an analyst at Standard Chartered Bank in Shanghai.China also raised taxes on coking coal and coke, key ingredients in steel making.The introduction of the export tax on coal would give Chinese producers such as Shenhua Energy (1088.HK: Quote, Profile, Research)(601088.SS: Quote, Profile, Research) and China Coal Ltd (1898.HK: Quote, Profile, Research)(601898.SS: Quote, Profile, Research) less incentive to sell spot coal cargoes abroad, and they could soon raise term prices, traders said.Coal exports had already slumped by a third in July from June as international prices fell from record highs, although shipments in the first seven months of the year are up 5 percent from a year ago as Chinese producers took advantage of the gap between lagging local prices and hot overseas markets.'This is yet another indicator that China's supplies will be tighter than we had initially expected and should be a boost to Asian coal prices,' said Mark Pervan, a senior commodities analyst at the Australian &amp;amp; New Zealand (ANZ) bank in Melbourne.Steam coal prices at Australia, a benchmark for Asia, snapped a five-week losing streak last week, rising $7.74 to $163.90 a tonne amid supply disruptions in Vietnam and Indonesia after falling from a record $201 a tonne in early July.
