 The Australian dollar was buying $US0.8742 late in trading on 14 August 2008. The currency peaked at $US0.8772 following a rise in the prices of commodities such as crude oil, silver and gold. Tony Morriss of the ANZ Bank says the currency could make further gains as a result of the rise in commodity prices. However, Sue Trinh of RBC Capital Markets warns that the currency could retreat again in the lead-up to the Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary policy meeting in September. The central bank is widely tipped to cut official interest rates by at least 0.25 per cent, while an 0.5 per cent reduction remains a possibility
