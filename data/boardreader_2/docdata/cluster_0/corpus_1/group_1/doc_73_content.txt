 THE ANZ bank yesterday pledged to pass on in full any rate cut announced by the Reserve Bank in September, even if the cash rate falls by as much as 50 basis points, as some analysts predict.The promise goes further than the National Australia Bank which, on Thursday, said they would slice 25 basis points off its rate but stopped short of guaranteeing to pass on any more than that, even if the Reserve Bank cut the cash rate by 50 basis points.But while borrowers may breathe a sigh of relief, the Commonwealth Bank says the respite may be short lived.Australia's biggest bank said that although it will 'probably' pass all of any cut by the Reserve Bank on to its borrowers next month, mortgage rates could start rising again later this year or early next - in spite of any further cuts by the Reserve.'The cost of funds in international markets - where we raise about a third of our capital - is still rising' Ross McEwan, group executive for retail banking services, said.'If that trend continues, and some of our domestic funding costs also rise, as we expect, then we will not be able to pass on any or all of further RBA cuts. Indeed, it is possible that our mortgage rates may start rising even as the cash rate is falling.'And the Commonwealth will not be alone. It says it is in a stronger position than other Australian banks to weather the credit crunch and that its rivals will have to raise their rates too - possibly just months after cutting them.The prediction comes just two weeks after it announced record profits of $4.7 billion - a fact that struggling homeowners find impossible to reconcile with the banks complaints about rising costs.Mr McEwan says maintaining profits and financial stability needs to be the bank's priority, otherwise borrowers will end up paying even more.'People say, why can't you just take less profit and give people cheaper mortgages?' he said.'But if we did, the international credit rating agencies would look at our margins being squeezed and our profits falling, and would probably reduce our AA credit rating which in turn would mean we'd have to pay more for our funds - then we'd have to raise mortgage rates again anyway.'He added that there are only 18 AA-rated banks in the world, and four are in Australia - while banks in the US and UK are being decimated by the global crunch.'Our focus has to be on maintaining that financial stability, especially in such uncertain times. That means our focus has to be on our own costs, not on what the RBA does. If that means that we have to ignore RBA cuts, then so be it. It will be to everybody's benefit in the end.'Rory Robertson, interest rate strategist at Macquarie, says that if the banks' cost of funds keeps rising, it will simply keep cutting the cash rate to offset the banks' costs, and ensure borrowers pay a lower mortgage rate.'If the RBA was cutting rates and the banks were going in the opposite direction, the RBA will cut its cash rate to help bring average rates down.'Ultimately, if the economy needs help with lower rates, the RBA will do what it takes to deliver those lower rates with a sharply lower cash rate.'
