 (CEP News) - The Bank of Japan will be at the forefront of most market-moving activity in the Asia-Pacific next week, with the release of the bank's latest monthly report and interest rate decision.The Monthly Report of Recent Economic and Financial Developments is scheduled for release on Wednesday morning, while the Monetary Policy Board is expected to announce its rate decision on Monday.Calyon chief Japanese economist Susumu Kato expects no change to current 0.50% rates, despite the bank's last hike 18 months ago. He says Japan's economy is in a precarious position right now, much like those of other countries around the world.'All the while [since February 2007], the BOJ has not cut interest rates despite revising down the judgment on overall economic conditions nor has it raised interest rates despite that the core CPI inflation rate has been above the central tendency of its thinking on price stability,' he wrote in a research note.The bank will release its monetary policy meeting minutes from last month on Thursday.On Tuesday, Australian markets will focus on the Reserve Bank of Australia's Board minutes. Economists from ANZ are saying there will be little change from the bank's current party line contained therein.'The August RBA Board meeting minutes are due for release on Tuesday. Short of actually giving the date of the impending rate cut there is little more the RBA needs to say to convince the market of what is coming,' they wrote. 'The minutes next week are only expected to re-affirm the dovish sentiment that has characterized the RBA's recent statements.'Rounding out the list of macroeconomic events next week, June's Westpac leading index for Australia is due out on Tuesday after coming in flat in May.All times in EDTSunday: The Bank of Japan's Monetary Policy Board begins its meeting ahead of Tuesday's interest rate decision.August 17 JP Bank of Japan to Hold Regular Policy Board MeetingMonday:Aside from BOJ rate announcements, other major releases include the Reserve Bank of Australia's August Board meeting minutes.
