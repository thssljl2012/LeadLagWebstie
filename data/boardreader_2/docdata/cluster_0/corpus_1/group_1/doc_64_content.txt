 Employers in Australia are scaling back their plans to hire more staff as the economy slows.The ANZ bank's monthly survey shows there was a .3 per cent fall in the number of jobs advertised in July, after a three per cent fall the month before.ANZ's Chief Economist Saul Eslake says it's possible the unemployment rate will increase from 4.2 per cent to 4.9 per cent over the next year. 'Employers are now scaling back their hiring intentions perhaps quite significantly, and combined with the stepping up in the last couple of months in the number of major lay-off announcements, tends to suggest that the unemployment rate is likely to rise over the year ahead,' he said.
