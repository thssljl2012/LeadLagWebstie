 Stronger than expected private sector spending, announced today, will give the Reserve Bank reason to pause before possibly cutting interest rates next week and giving mortgage holders relief from decade-high interest rates.Spending by private businesses gained 5.7% in the June quarter, higher than expected, following a 2.5% contraction in the last quarter. A survey of 23 analysts by Bloomberg forecast expenditures would grow 2%.The figure will likely push up the June quarter gross domestic product reading, to be released next week, giving the RBA a sense of how fast the economy is growing.The RBA has been trying to balance its fight against inflation which has seen it push the cash rate up to 7.25%, against an economy at risk of slowing too quickly, hitting businesses growth and putting people out of work. RBA-watchers have tipped the cental bank to cut rates when it meets next week, bringing the official cash rate down to 7% or possibly 6.75%.Commercial banks have jacked up their lending rates to an average of 9.6% since the start of the year, blaming the higher cost of doing business brought on by the global credit crunch. Australian banks traditionally track their lending rate changes to fluctuations by the RBA.In recent weeks, ANZ Bank and National Australia Bank have pledged to pass at least some of the cuts along, while Commonwealth Bank and Westpac won't rule out keeping mortgage rates high.The stronger private business spending comes one day after the value of construction for the June quarter fell more than expected, dropping 2.6%, to a near two-year low.czappone@fairfax.com.auBusinessDay
