 SYDNEY, Aug 18 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar hovered just above seven-month lows against a buoyant U.S. currency on Monday as lower commodity prices and worries about a global economic slowdown saw investors toe a cautious line. * Australia is a big exporter of commodities and another sharp fall in the CRB commodities index  on Friday weighed down on the Aussie. Investors have been aggressively unwinding long commodity and short U.S. dollar bets in the past two weeks, sending the U.S. currency to multi-month peaks. * By 9:30 a.m., the Aussie  was at $0.8670/74 against the U.S. dollar, up from $0.8631/36 late here on Friday, but not far from a seven-month low of $0.8590 struck last Wednesday. It has shed nearly 14 percent since it struck a 25-year high of $0.9851 on July 15. * Currency speculators continued to pare long positions in the Aussie. Data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday showed net long positions declined to 9,053 contracts in the week to Aug. 12, from 14,747 contracts a week earlier. [nN15440568] * The Aussie found some support from improved risk appetite. Better-than-expected economic data from the United States lent support to stock markets and leveraged carry trades. [nN15303552] The Aussie firmed to 95.72 yen  from 95.20 yen late here on Friday. It had fallen to a four-month low last week on aggressive selling by Japanese investors. * The Aussie hovered near 10-week lows against the New Zealand dollar  amid strong expectations of a steep rate cut in Australia next month. Futures  are pricing in a better-than-even chance of a 50 basis point cut, while most expect the Reserve Bank of New Zealand to reduce rates by 25 basis points in September. * More clues on the central bank's thinking will emerge from Tuesday's release of the minutes of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) last board meeting held on Aug. 4. At that meeting, the bank kept rates unchanged at a 12-year high of 7.25 percent, but signalled the next move was likely to be lower. * Last week, RBA Deputy Governor Ric Battellino gave the strongest signal yet that a rate cut was coming in September when he said authorities would not wait for inflation to fall before easing policy. * Australian bonds were buoyed by expectations the RBA will lower interest rates in the coming months. They also benefited from firmer U.S. Treasuries, as falling energy prices lessened the chances of higher inflation and interest rates in the world's largest economy. * Three-year bond futures  were up 0.025 points at 94.335, while the 10-year bond contract  was up by 0.05 points to 94.235.(Reporting by Anirban Nag; Editing by James Thornhill)copying, republication or redistribution of Thomson Financial News Content, including by framing or similar means, is expressly prohibited without the prior written consent of Thomson Financial News.
