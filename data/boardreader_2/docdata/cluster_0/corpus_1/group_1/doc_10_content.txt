 NEW YORK Aug 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Thursday as insurer American International Group and Citigroup weighed on the financial sector, while lower-than-expected July sales by Wal-Mart Stores Inc raised concerns about consumer spending and profit outlook.Shares of AIG sank 17.5 percent, their biggest fall in more than two decades, as the world's largest insurer posted its third consecutive quarterly loss. Wal-Mart's stock fell 4.9 percent.Also weighing on the financial sector was Citigroup, which dropped 3.6 percent after the bank agreed to buy back more than $7 billion of illiquid auction-rate securities, settling charges the largest U.S. bank marketed the debt fraudulently.In a sign of economic slowing, a government report showed the number of people filing for first-time jobless benefits in the latest week jumped to the highest level in more than six years. 'We still believe that there is weakness in the economy; however, there is also inflation,' said Rob Stein, managing partner of Chicago-based Astor Asset Management. 'This morning's numbers on jobless claims continued to support the thesis that job creation is minimal, if not negative.' The Dow Jones industrial average was down 112.20 points, or 0.96 percent, at 11,543.87. The Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 Index was down 10.66 points, or 0.83 percent, at 1,278.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 3.01 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,375.36.AIG also reported a general deterioration in its mainstream insurance business. Investors, who had driven stocks higher for two days, took the AIG news as suggesting that fallout from the credit crisis, spawned by the U.S. housing slump, was far from over. 'AIG has dampened the recent momentum,' said Andre Bakhos, president of Princeton Financial in Princeton, New Jersey. 'The bears were looking for a reason to sell and AIG provided it.' News of the Citigroup settlement over the auction-rate debt 'puts pressure on other players like UBS, HSBC, Merrill Lynch, to do the same thing,' said Brian Yelvington, analyst with CreditSights in New York.Wal-Mart's 3 percent rise sales at U.S. stores open at least a year missed Wall Street estimates and was accompanied by a cautious forecast for August. Its shares declined to $57.77.But on the bright side, shares of home builders inched higher after a report by the National Association of Realtors showed U.S. pending home sales unexpectedly rose in June. The Dow home construction index climbed 1.5 percent.U.S. crude oil prices rose about $1 to $119.56 a barrel, trimming earlier gains of more than $3 a barrel.(Additional reporting by Walden Siew; Editing by Kenneth Barry)((Ellis.Mnyandu@thomsonreuters.com; +1 646 223 6085; Reuters Messaging:ellis.mnyandu.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: MARKETS STOCKS tf.TFN-Europe_newsdesk@thomsonreuters.com ms1Interactive Investor brings you breaking news throughout the day to support your investment decisions.
