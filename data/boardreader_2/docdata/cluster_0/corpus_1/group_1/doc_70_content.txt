 HOUSE prices have declined by the sharpest rate in more than three years as home owners struggled with 12-year high interest rates.  house price index - which calculates the average for the country's eight capitals - fell 0.3 per cent in the June quarter. Economists had expected a decline of 1.0 per cent for the quarter. The annual index rate was at its slowest pace in two years at 8.2 per cent, compared with 13.2 per cent growth in year to March. The report adds to a slew of other data showing the economy is slowing sharply, raising speculation the Reserve Bank will cut interest rates before the end of the year. The Reserve Bank holds its monthly board meeting tomorrow, but economists expect it to keep its key cash rate unchanged for a fifth straight month. Perth suffered the biggest drop in house prices, falling 2.4 per cent in the June quarter, and were now dropping at an annual rate of 0.9 per cent. Hobart reported a 2.0 per cent decline and Canberra a 1.4 per cent fall. Darwin had the biggest increase with a rise of 1.9 per cent, while the country's largest housing market - Sydney - rose 0.3 per cent. Other private data also showed the country's job prospects are looking gloomy with businesses further winding back hiring intentions. Job advertisements fell for a third successive month, according to the ANZ bank. It said newspaper and internet job ads fell by 0.3 per cent in July. ANZ co-head of economics Warren Hogan said jobs growth was likely to slow in coming months, and predicted the jobless rate would climb to 4.9 per cent by June 2009, up from 4.2 per cent in June 2008.
