 The ANZ bank says it cannot guarantee that it will pass on in full any Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) interest rate cuts.The Reserve Bank is tipped to cut rates as soon as next month but there are warnings that banks might not pass the full reduction on to customers.ANZ chief economist Saul Eslake says the bank's costs are now determined by factors unrelated to the official rate. 'We would like to pass on in full any reduction in official interest rates,' he said. 'Whether we can do so or not depends on the extent to which a reduction in official rates is mirrored in our overall cost of funds.'
