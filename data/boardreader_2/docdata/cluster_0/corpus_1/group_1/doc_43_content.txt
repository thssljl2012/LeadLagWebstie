 SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian investment firm Babcock &amp;amp; Brown Ltd (BNB.AX: Quote, Profile, Research) warned on Monday its full-year earnings would not beat last year's due to difficult market conditions, sending its shares down as much as 13 percent.The company said full-year 2008 earnings would not beat the A$643 million ($569 million) posted in 2007. It had previously predicted 2008 profit of around A$750 million, while a Reuters estimate of seven analysts expected full-year net profit of about A$670 million.Analysts said Babcock &amp;amp; Brown had finally bowed to the inevitable. 'With consensus for the full year at A$670 million, the market had anticipated a downgrade, albeit we are no closer to gaining comfort with CY09e forecasts,' Citi said in a research note, referring to calendar year forecasts.The group also said on Monday that first-half net profit was expected to be 25-40 percent below the year-earlier's A$250 million. 'The volatile global capital market conditions have made and continue to make business conditions uncertain and forecasting in the short term difficult,' CEO Phil Green said in a statement. Babcock &amp;amp; Brown's shares fell as much as 13.1 percent to a 7-week low and were down 9.9 percent at A$6.13 by 0330 GMT, in a wider market that was up 0.45 percent.Many of Australia's major banks and financial firms are under scrutiny after National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) (NAB.AX: Quote, Profile, Research) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) (ANZ.AX: Quote, Profile, Research) issued profit warnings, shaking confidence in their ability to weather the credit crunch.
