 Crude oil prices jumped on the New York Mercantile Exchange Monday as a tropical storm called Fay tested investors' nerves. Shell evacuated about 360 employees from the Gulf of Mexico oil rigs as Fay moved toward the western coast of Florida with sustained winds of 50 mph, The Wall Street Journal reported. 'There could be some supply disruption issues there so the market is watching this closely,' Mark Pervan, a commodity strategist at ANZ Bank told the Journal. Oil prices jumped $1.80 above Friday's closing price to $114.35 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Heating oil prices fell slightly, down 0.014 cents to $3.111 per gallon. Reformulated blendstock gasoline prices rose 0.004 cent to $2.864 per gallon. Natural gas prices fell 0.196 cents to $7.913 per million British thermal units. The national average retail price of unleaded regular gasoline fell 1 cent from Sunday's price to $3.741 per gallon, the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report said.
