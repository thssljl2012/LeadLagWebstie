 Asian markets, with exception of South Korea, roared back to life Friday, inspired by a stronger than expected revised growth figure in the United States and a forecast-beating industrial output reading in Japan. Stocks ended the day higher across Asia on Friday, after the Dow Jones industrial average rose for a third consecutive day, surging 1.9% on thin volume, to 11,715.18 overnight on Wall Street. Investors, both in the West and in Asia, were heartened by the U.S. Commerce Department's revised gross domestic product growth figure of 3.3% for the April-June quarter, reported Thursday. The revised number compares with an initial reading of 1.9% and soundly beat the market forecast of 2.7%. (See ) A raft of Japanese economic data came out before the market opened on Friday, helping to alleviate worries about the state of the global economy. Japan's industrial output rose a seasonally adjusted 0.9% in July from June, outperforming a median market forecast for a 0.5% decline, as makers of cars, electronics and nonferrous metals boosted production. In addition, the country's unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 4.0% in July, against a consensus forecast of 4.1%, as more jobs were created in the general services and medical/welfare service sectors.Nonetheless, the Japanese government is concerned enough about weak consumer spending that it unveiled a stimulus package after the market closed. The measures were valued at $108 billion, yet only $18 billion of that really represents new spending, and analysts were skeptical about their impact.
