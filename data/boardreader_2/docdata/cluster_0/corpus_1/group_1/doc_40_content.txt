 SYDNEY, Aug 22 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar held near 10-day highs against a stumbling U.S. currency on Friday, bolstered by higher commodities, but remained vulnerable to worries about the financial sector and the prospect of lower interest rates. * Commodities extended their rally, with oil, gold and industrial metals gaining. The CRB commodities index  rose 3.73 percent on Thursday, proving solid support to the Aussie as the country is a big exporter of resources. * By 9:25 a.m. the Aussie dollar  was at $0.8783/85 against the U.S. dollar, up from $0.8735/38 late here on Thursday, but below a 10-day high of $0.8815 struck in offshore trade. * Worries about the financial sector deepened after the country's third-biggest lender, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd  on Friday said a review of its securities lending business had revealed management weakness [nSYU004988]. * Making matters worse was news that Insurance Australia Group  reported an annual loss of A$261 million [nSYD339284]. * These developments come amid fresh worries about the U.S. financial sector as Citigroup cut its third quarter earnings estimates for Lehman Brothers . It also lowered estimates for Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch  and Morgan Stanley  citing expected losses from fixed-income assets [nBNG271027]. * The Aussie was unlikely to go far amid strong expectations of a rate cut next month. Rate futures  are pricing in a 25 basis point cut, the first reduction in seven years. A move will diminish some of the Aussie's high-yield allure. * Aussie eased to 95.31 yen  from an offshore high of 95.87 yen amid lingering risk aversion and expectations of an Australian rate cut that would cut the Aussie's yield appeal. * Australian bonds were lower, tracking losses for U.S. Treasuries which fell after the surge in oil prices renewed concerns about a spike in inflation. * Three-year Australian bond futures  fell 0.05 points to 94.350, while the 10-year bond contract  shed 0.045 points to 94.255.(Reporting by Anirban Nag; Editing by Jonathan Standing)copying, republication or redistribution of Thomson Financial News Content, including by framing or similar means, is expressly prohibited without the prior written consent of Thomson Financial News.
