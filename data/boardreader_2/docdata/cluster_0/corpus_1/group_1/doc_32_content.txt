 SYDNEY -(Dow Jones)- HSBC Bank Australia said Monday it has cut its fixed interest rates on home loans by 35-130 basis points, reflecting the recent fall in short-term funding costs.In a statement, HSBC said new borrowers can benefit from a promotional three- year fixed rate of 7.99%, while standard fixed rates for one, two and three years have been cut to 8.99% and four and five-year rates cut to 8.90%. 'Recent weeks have seen a significant reduction in the medium and long-term cost of fixed rate funds in the commercial market, with yields loosening as the market factors in the expectation of a cut in official interest rates in the coming months,' John Lane, head of home loans, said in a statement.The cuts follow recent changes to fixed rates by other lenders, including Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) and Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AU).All eyes are on whether Australia's major banks pass on lower funding costs, including any cut to the official cash rate by the Reserve Bank of Australia, to variable home loan borrowers.Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan repeated Monday that banks should pass on any future cut to official rates in full to borrowers. -By Lyndal McFarland, Dow Jones Newswires; 61-2-8235-2957; lyndal.mcfarland@ dowjones.com Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http:// www.djnewsplus.com/al?rnd=L30EkQi6Dwrl3caTngbQ3w%3D%3D.
