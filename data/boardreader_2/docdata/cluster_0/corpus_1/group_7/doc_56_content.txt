hrs NEW YORK - US stocks tumbled Friday after the government reported the US economy contracted in the fourth quarter at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, the sharpest fall in 26 years.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 148.15 points (1.82 percent) to finish at 8,000.86.   The Dow earlier had slipped briefly below the psychological 8,000 level, hitting an intraday low of 7,961.99.   The tech-rich Nasdaq fell 31.42 points (2.08 percent) to 1,476.42 and the broad-market Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index retreated 19.26 points (2.28 percent) to 825.88. 'It was a disappointing end to the week, and the month, on Wall Street. Poor economic and earnings reports continued to pile up, sending the S&amp;P 500 to its worst January on record,' said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at Wachovia Securities.   Stocks fell after the Commerce Department reported that gross domestic product (GDP) contracted at a 3.8 percent pace in the 2008 fourth quarter, after shrinking 0.5 percent in the third quarter.   It was the sharpest quarterly decline since 1982 but far less than the consensus forecast of a 5.5 percent annualized drop. 'The headline on this GDP report is not as bad as feared, but the breakdown doesn't provide much encouragement,' said Patrick O'Hare at Briefing.com.   Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the figure was 'very much an illusion' created by an unexpected increase in business inventories. He predicted the 2009 first quarter could contract more sharply.   Christina Romer, chair of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisors, warned the deepening recession highlighted the need for a quick stimulus plan. 'Immediate action to support both the financial sector and overall demand is essential,' she said. Investor sentiment also took a hit from worse than expected January data on manufacturing activity in the Midwest, measured by the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index, and the University of Michigan reading's on US consumer sentiment.   The financial sector was in the crosshairs as investors fretted about the government's approach to staving off economic collapse.   Citigroup was the steepest decliner of the Dow's 30 blue chips, plunging 8.97 percent to 3.55 dollars. Bank of America dropped 2.95 percent to 6.58 dollars.   On the final day of trading in January, a Wall Street adage added to the gloom. The tradition has it that the month of January reflects the direction of the market for the year: the Dow shed 8.84 percent in the month.   Among stocks in focus, Amazon vaulted 17.64 percent to 58.82 dollars. The online retailer reported after Thursday's market close fourth-quarter earnings that beat estimates.   The Dow's two oil majors finished lower after bucking the session's downtrend.   Exxon Mobil, the Dow's biggest component, slipped 0.68 percent to 76.48 after posting a 2008 net profit of 45.22 billion dollars, the largest annual profit ever declared by any publicly listed company, and Chevron fell 0.14 percent to 70.52 after reporting 2008 net profit up 28 percent.   Procter &amp; Gamble fell 6.39 percent to 54.50. The consumer products maker announced in-line quarterly earnings but warned of tough conditions ahead.   Bonds fell back again. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond rose to 2.844 percent from 2.815 percent Thursday and that on the 30-year bond climbed to 3.603 percent from 3.559 percent. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.   - AFP /ls
