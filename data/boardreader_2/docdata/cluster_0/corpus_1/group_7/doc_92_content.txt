Stock markets around the world tumbled this morning amid deepening concern over the health of the banking industry and doubts about the ability of governments to spur a recovery.  The Dow Jones industrial average sank almost 300 points in the first 20 minutes of trading, coming within a whisker of its late-November low. European markets sagged more than 3% while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index fell almost 4%.  Banking stocks were pounded anew in a vivid display of the fears surrounding the sector. Investors were nonplused last week by the lack of details in President Obama's bank-rescue plan, and predictions continue to circulate that some major banks could be nationalized.  As of 7:10 a.m. Pacific, the Dow was down 250.81 points, or 3.2%, to 7,599.60. The blue-chip index fell as low as 7,554.91, less than three points above its 7,552.29 closing low on Nov. 20.  The S&amp;P 500 fell 30.76 points, or 3.7%, to 796.08. The drop below 800 was troubling because many investors had viewed its ability to remain above that mark as a sign of the market's resilience.  Financials were the worst-performing of the S&amp;P's 10 major industry groups, diving 6.7% as all 81 financial stocks skidded. Bank of America Corp. slumped 11% and Citigroup Inc. fell 9%.  The Nasdaq composite tumbled 58.42 points, or 3.8%, to 1,475.94.  walter.hamilton@latimes.com
