The over-all stock market numbers suggested the answer was yes  although some stocks continued Friday's impressive rally in anticipation of big moves on Tuesday.  The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8270.87, down 9.72 points, or 0.1 per cent. The broader S&amp;P 500 closed at 829.89, up 1.29 points, or 0.2 per cent.  Stocks that may have the most to gain from coming announcements by the U.S. administration gained the most, with General Electric Co. up 13.9 per cent and Bank of America Corp. up 12.4 per cent.  On the other hand, defensive stocks fell out of favour. Coca-Cola Co. fell 2.9 per cent, Procter &amp; Gamble fell 2 per cent and Kraft Foods Inc. fell 1.8 per cent.  In Canada, the S&amp;P/TSX composite index closed at 9047.28, up 39.26 points, or 0.4 per cent  unable to hold onto its earlier triple-digit advances after some energy stocks pared their gains and gold producers fell further into the red.  Barrick Gold Corp. fell 4.5 per cent and Goldcorp Inc. fell 3.5 per cent after the price of gold plunged to $892.80 (U.S.) an ounce, down $21.50. Suncor Energy Inc. rose 2.2 per cent and EnCana Corp. rose 2.8 per cent, even though crude oil fell to $39.56 a barrel, down 61 cents.  Most financials enjoyed modest gains, with Royal Bank of Canada up 1 per cent and Toronto-Dominion Bank up 2.2 per cent.
