U.S. stocks fell for the fourth straight week, capping the market's worst January retreat, after companies from Procter &amp; Gamble to Caterpillar and Allstate reported earnings that trailed estimates. P&amp;G, the largest consumer-products maker, declined to a 2 1/2 -year low after revenue dropped more than analysts forecast. Caterpillar, the biggest maker of bulldozers and excavators, had its steepest weekly slump since October after announcing 20,000 job cuts because of the recession. Allstate plunged 19 percent as it reported investment losses that caused the home and auto insurer's first unprofitable year as a public company. 'Earnings are a disaster, and they're just going to get worse,' said Diane Garnick, an investment strategist at Invesco Ltd. in New York. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.7 percent, to 825.88, for the week, leaving the measure down 8.6 percent in January. Its four-week losing streak is the longest since July. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.9 percent, to 8000.86, driving its monthly loss to 8.8 percent. The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.1 percent, to 1476.42, leaving it down 6.4 for the month.  Profits have decreased 38 percent for the 208 companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have released fourth-quarter results since Jan. 12. Analysts forecast that the drop will narrow to 32 percent once the other 292 companies report. In March, they projected a 55 percent earnings surge, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Speculation that the government will buy impaired assets from banks helped limit the stock market's loss last week. Citigroup and Bank of America gained 2.3 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively, two of the biggest gains in the Dow average. Both lenders tumbled more than 47 percent in January. Wells Fargo advanced 19 percent during the week as it said it doesn't need more federal aid.  Yields on Treasury securities climbed as the results of an auction of five-year notes signaled the growing supply of U.S. government debt to finance recovery measures exceeds investor demand. The benchmark 10-year note's yield climbed to 2.85 percent, from 2.62 percent.  The Treasury will auction $29 billion of three-month bills and $29 billion of six-month bills tomorrow. They yielded 0.23 percent and 0.36 percent, respectively, in when-issued trading. One-month bills will be sold Tuesday.
