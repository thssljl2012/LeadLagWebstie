U.S. stocks rallied for a second day yesterday on hopes Washington's stimulus package and a bank rescue plan will bolster the ailing economy, even as data showed the biggest one-month job losses in 34 years. A nearly 12% surge in bank shares led Wall Street higher. Investors anticipate the plan to be announced on Monday by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will shore up banks' balance sheets and spur lending. Bank of America Corp. (BAC/NYSE) soared more than 25% the day after falling to its lowest level since 1984 on investor fears it would have to be nationalized -- a fear that the company's chief executive said yesterday was unfounded. As well, the Senate struggled to craft a hefty stimulus package, with moderate senators trying to trim the US$937-billion price tag.
