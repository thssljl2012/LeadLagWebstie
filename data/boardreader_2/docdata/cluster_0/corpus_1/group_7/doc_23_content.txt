The sharemarket eased today but pockets of strength among top stocks, including a rebound for Fisher &amp; Paykel Appliances, helped ward off the larger falls seen offshore.  Asian stocks slid, with Japan's Nikkei hitting a three-month low, and the euro hit a two-month low against the US dollar as investors scrambled for safety from deteriorating global economic conditions and concerns about European banks.  The NZSX-50 index lost 7.56 points, or 0.28 per cent, to 2672.62, having shed 2.6 per cent yesterday following F&amp;P Appliance's shock debt and profit warning.  Turnover totalled $98.2 million.  Fisher &amp; Paykel said yesterday it was looking for a cornerstone investor and it expected net profit to fall by as much as 54 per cent to between $25m and $30m.  Shares in the iconic company, which reached a record low of 58c before ending yesterday at 65c, closed up 7c at 72 today. 'The rebound (was) mainly to do with the Prime Minister's comments that he would possibly look to support the company, so we have seen a bit of speculative buying on the back of those comments,' said Grant Williamson of Hamilton Hindin Greene.  Prime Minister John Key said it would be unacceptable for an important company such as  to fail because of a temporary crisis.  Among other blue chips, Telecom rose a cent to 250 despite a ratings downgrade by Moody's, Fletcher Building lost 5c to 558, Contact Energy was down 7c at 637, F&amp;P Healthcare was flat at 335, Sky City gained a cent to 282 and Auckland Airport was up 2c at 190.
