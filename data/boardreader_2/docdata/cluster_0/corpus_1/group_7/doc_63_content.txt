SINGAPORE, Feb 10 (Reuters) - CapitaMall Trust fell as much as 6.9 percent on Tuesday, one day after it announced a rights issue to raise S$1.2 billion which analysts described as huge and dilutive in terms of distribution per unit.  A local dealer said the size of CapitaMall's 9-for-10 rights issue led some investors to dump the units rather than cough up more money. 'While widely expected, we believe the rights issue was larger and more dilutive than expected,' UBS said in a report.  The Swiss bank maintained a 'buy' rating on CapitaMall but reduced its target price from S$2.69 to S$1.64.  CapitaMall, Singapore's largest real estate investment trust, on Monday announced a 9-for-10 rights issue priced at S$0.82 per unit, or at a 43 percent discount to the last traded price, to finance debt and pay for asset enhancements.  By 0640 GMT, CapitaMall Trust were down 6.2 percent at S$1.36.   The benchmark Straits Times Index was 0.64 percent higher.  CapitaLand, Southeast Asia's largest developer, surged as much as 8.9 percent on Tuesday after analysts said its planned S$1.84 billion rights issue would give it the financial flexibility for acquisitions.  Bank of America-Merill Lynch upgraded CapitaLand to 'buy' from 'underperform' following the rights call, saying it would put CapitaLand in a good position for opportunistic buys.  A local dealer added that some investors were buying back the stock 'on fact' after selling them during the past three weeks amid rumours of a pending rights issue.  CapitaLand said on Monday announced a 1-for-2 rights issue and said quarterly net profit fell 88 percent..  At 0354 GMT, shares of CapitaLand were up 6.8 percent at S$2.53 while the benchmark Straits Times Index gained 0.42 percent.
