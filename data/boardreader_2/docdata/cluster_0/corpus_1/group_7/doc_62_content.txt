Equity and crude oil markets rose on Monday as a flight to safety eased in anticipation the U.S. Congress will pass an $800 billion (535 billion pound) economic recovery plan and help restore confidence in battered financial markets.  European shares rose for the fourth session in five, wiping out almost all year-to-date losses in an index of top regional shares, and U.S. stocks edged higher.  Crude oil prices inched up after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries said it was willing to cut oil output further if needed to stabilise prices. 'The stimulus package is a supportive structural factor,' said Harry Tchilinguirian, an oil analyst at BNP Paribas in London. 'It should begin to have an impact on the economy in the second half of this year and is an underlying element conditioning sentiment.' A newly energized President Barack Obama began a new drive to win passage of the stimulus package, flying to Elkhart, Indiana, to make the case for it to residents of a city where the unemployment rate has soared to 15.3 percent from 4.7 percent a year ago.  Obama was due to hold his first White House news conference in the evening.  Focus on the stimulus package led the administration to postpone Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's much-awaited announcement of a bank rescue plan until Tuesday.  The dollar, which has benefited from a safe-haven bid recently, fell broadly as investors shrugged off that delay and focussed instead on the positive impact of the rescue plan. 'Currency investors are holding out hope that this bailout package would be positive overall for the global economy and financial markets,' said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT Forex in New York.  The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index off 0.76 percent at 84.634.  The euro rose 0.97 percent to $1.3056, and against the yen, the dollar fell 0.39 percent to 91.62.  Financial shares rose on both sides of the Atlantic as investors dismissed renewed signs of corporate weakness.  Whirlpool Corp said earnings would fall further in 2009 after the world's biggest appliance maker posted a 76 percent decline in quarterly profit.  Bank of America shares rose 11 percent, while the KBW Bank index climbed 2.96 percent.  Regional banks also gained, with Huntington Bancshares climbing 22 percent. Among insurers, Hartford Financial climbed 21 percent.  Before 1 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average rose 12.82 points, or 0.15 percent, to 8,293.41. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index added 3.17 points, or 0.36 percent, to 871.77. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 2.51 points, or 0.16 percent, to 1,594.22.  In Europe a rise in bank stocks was supported by better-than-expected results at Barclays , which rose 10.9 percent after posting a 6.1 billion pound ($9 billion) profit and saying credit market losses were waning.  Other banks on the rise included Deutsche Bank , up 6.2 percent, and Commerzbank , up 8.5 percent. 'Fundamentally the market is positioning itself for a rally,' said Darren Winder, head of macro and strategy research at Cazenove, in London. 'We're halfway through the recession, and we're on very low multiples.' The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares rose 0.5 percent to close at 830.08 points, its highest close since January 13.  U.S. Treasury debt prices eased as investors continued to fret over the impact of a record $67 billion in new government debt to be issued this week, amid lingering worries about how the economic stimulus package will turn out.  The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 15/32 in price to yield 3.05 percent, while the 2-year U.S. Treasury note slipped 3/32 in price to yield 1.05 percent.  Euro zone government bonds also slipped, pushing the 10-year Bund yield to a 2-1/2-month high ahead of a string of new issuance in longer-dated maturities this week.  The 10-year yield rose as high as 3.444 percent, its highest since late November, before pulling back to 3.3407 percent.  The bank-to-bank cost of borrowing dollar funds over three months also eased as investors awaited the unveiling of the U.S. rescue plan for the embattled financial industry.  U.S. light sweet crude oil rose 42 cents to $40.59 a barrel. Spot gold prices fell $19.60 to $890.95 an ounce.
