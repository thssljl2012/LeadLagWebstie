MELBOURNE, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 2.7  percent on Wednesday, led by top miners and energy stocks after  copper and oil prices fell on more signs of a deepening global  recession.  BHP Billiton, the world's biggest global miner, and  rival Rio Tinto both fell more than 4 percent.  'The economic data on the global front continues to get  worse, and the Australian economy is slowing very quickly. So I  think you need to start factoring in further weakness for equity  markets globally,' said Savanth Sebastian, equities economist at  broker CommSec.  While more red alerts emerged on the health of European  banks, Australia's second-largest bank, Westpac Banking Corp , highlighted the resilience of local banks, reporting a  steady first-quarter profit despite a steep rise in bad debts.  Westpac shares fell 2.7 percent, in line with the broader  market, while National Australia Bank and Australia and  New Zealand Banking Group fell around 1.5 percent.  The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 shed 93.1 points to 3,371.2  by 0015 GMT, extending a 1.5 percent slide on Tuesday.  New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index traded down 1.8  percent at 2,624.9.
