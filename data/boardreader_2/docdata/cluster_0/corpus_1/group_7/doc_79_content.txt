(RTTNews) - After showing a notable decline in early trading on Monday, stocks have moved back to the upside over the course of the morning. The major averages have all moved well off their worst levels of the day.  The recovery by the markets is partly due to significant strength that has emerged among banking stocks, which are adding to the substantial gains posted on Friday. Dow component Bank of America (BAC) is posting a notable gain, rising 12.2 percent.  Oil service stocks are also turning in strong performances, benefiting from a notable increase by the price of oil. With crude oil currently up $1.24 at $41.41 a barrel, the Philadelphia Oil Service Index is up 3 percent.  While some strength is also visible among natural gas, tobacco, and health insurance stocks, continued weakness in the gold, healthcare provider, and utilities sectors is limiting the upside for the broader markets.  The major averages have shown a lack of direction in recent trading, but they are currently all posting modest gains. The Dow is currently up 9.63 at 8,290.22, the Nasdaq is up 0.62 at 1,592.33 and the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.93 at 871.53.
