US share prices suffered a 'broad slide' in early trading on Thursday (February 12th) as worries over the adequacy over government plans to stabilise the economy and revive the banking sector drowned out a surprise bounce in January retail sales.  Even with Congress set to enter a second round of voting on the Obama administration's $789 billion (552 billion) economic stimulus package later today, there was selling 'across a broad range of sectors', Reuters stated.  Financial stocks struggled, reflecting investors' continuing concerns about a lack of detail regarding the Obama team's plans to cleanse banks' balance sheets of toxic debts.  JP Morgan shed 6.2 per cent, Citigroup fell almost six per cent and Bank of America saw approximately seven per cent knocked off its share price.  Energy shares were also hurt by a decline in oil prices, with Exxon Mobil and Chevron both shedding more than two per cent.  In recent trading, the S&amp;P 500 Index was down 19.36 points at 814.38. The Nasdaq Composite Index had dropped 24.98 points to stand at 1,505.52.
