 Asian shares rose Thursday, cuing off a late run higher on Wall Street, but markets faded in and out of positive territory in early trade suggesting a lack of clear direction in the near-term. Trading updates and earnings reports from Australian companies largely met reduced expectations, but still affirmed the sharp deterioration in Australia's business environment. Better results in New Zealand gave shares there more of a filip early, but gains were eroded as the session wore on. Japan's export-dependent stocks remain supported by the weaker yen, with the dollar holding above Y97, a three-month high. The yen has reversed course from its overbought levels as fears mount over the health of the Japanese economy. The dollar was last at Y97.51, against Y97.55 late in New York. The Nikkei 225 was last up 0.6% at 7502.41; Australia's ASX was up 0.5% at 3296.3; the NZX-50 was 0.2% higher at 2504.93. South Korea's Kospi Composite outperformed, rising 1.6% to 1084.14. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been off nearly 200 points earlier in the session, ended the day down 80.05 points, or 1.09%, at 7270.89. Banks rose after U.S. officials unveiled details of the Treasury's plan to convert stakes to common stock, although the wider index remained anchored by a bleak housing report from The National Association of Realtors. 'I'm taking some heart in the fact the Dow did seem to find a level last night,' says Southern Cross Equities director Charlie Aitken. 'I may be a few days early, but I feel a bear rally brewing in the U.S.' In corporate news, Australia's largest telecommunications group Telstra Corp. beat forecasts on its first-half net profit, but cut guidance for the full year. The nation's largest property developer, Lend Lease Corp., and Westfield Group, its largest shopping mall owner, posted their expected net losses, while ANZ Group, Australia's fourth-largest bank, said it will probably cut its dividend by 25%. IAG, Australia's largest general insurer, could post only a modest profit on its half year. In New Zealand, PGG Wrightson rose after saying it has agreement with banks to refinance existing loans, while Air NZ was up despite a lower first half, after saying it expects significant improvement in the second half. Nuplex, however, was down sharply after its poor first half result. Oil futures were well up after U.S. gasoline inventories fell sharply, and oil stockpiles appeared close to following suit. April Nymex crude closed 6.4% higher at $42.50 a barrel in New York. The contract was at $42.39 in early Asian trade. Gold, however, continued its slide and was at $951.65 a troy ounce, down 75 cents from the New York close. -Contact: 201-938-5400
