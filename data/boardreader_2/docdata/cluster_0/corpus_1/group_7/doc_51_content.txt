AUSTRALIAN shares opened higher today on the strength of banks and Westfield, defying a negative lead from Wall Street. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 rose 25.6 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 3353.1 in the first half hour of trade, while the All Ordinaries was up 24.5 points to 3306.   Telecommunications was the only sector in the red, after Telstra fell 1.3 per cent to $3.72 after chief executive Sol Trujillo resigned and the telecom posted a dip in first-half net profit to $1.92 billion.   The Big Four banks were riding higher on strong gains in their US and European counterparts after the US Treasury Department outlined its plan on how to help banks of all sizes survive a worse-than-expected downturn.   ANZ lagged gains in its rivals, after the bank said it expected its full-year dividend to be 25 per cent lower than the previous year. ANZ was up 0.7 per cent to $12.59.   Westfield was up 1.5 per cent to $9.90 despite reporting a full-year net loss of $2.2 billion.   Overnight in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had been off nearly 200 points earlier in the session, ended down 80.05 points, or 1.1 per cent, at 7270.89.   A slide in industrial companies such as Boeing had weighed on the Dow after a bleak housing report and offset the strong gains in financial stocks.   The National Association of Realtors said sales of existing homes in the US fell 5.3 per cent in January, the weakest reading since July, 1997. About 45 per cent of home-sales involved distressed property transactions, including foreclosures. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 closed down 1.1 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 1.1 per cent.
