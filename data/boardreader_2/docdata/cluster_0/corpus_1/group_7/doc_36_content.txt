The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 46.5 points, or 1.35 per cent, at 3,402.4 while the broader All Ordinaries index fell 45 points, or 1.32 per cent, to 3,353.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange at 1617 AEDT, the March share price index futures contract was 30 points lower at 3,370 on a volume of 18,235 contracts.  'With all this bad news circling the global economic environment, participants aren't willing to hold positions over the weekend, so we're seeing some good old Friday profit-taking,' IG Markets research analyst Ben Potter said.  'Leading the market lower today are the industrials, financials, material and consumer discretionary sectors.'  Mr Potter said Asian markets were significantly weaker on Friday, 'all pointing towards a very interesting session on Wall Street tonight'.  He said Macquarie Infrastructure Group was a poor performer on the local bourse after brokers UBS and ABN AMRO cut the toll road operator's target price to $1.70 and $2.52, respectively.  Macquarie Infrastructure Group shares were down 11.5 cents, or 8.49 per cent, at $1.24.  The major banks were all weaker. National Australia Bank gave up 39 cents, or 2.12 per cent, to $18.01 as it said its former head of Australian operations, Ahmed Fahour, would cease to be a member of the board and executive committee.  Commonwealth Bank shed 28 cents to $29.57, Westpac retreated 62 cents to $16.38 and ANZ slipped 15 cents to $12.45.  ANZ chief executive Mike Smith says he expects to rising debt among retail customers in the second half of this year and early 2010 as unemployment rises.  The mining giants were mixed. BHP Billiton was up 35 cents at $30.51 while debt-laden rival Rio Tinto dropped $1.49 to $50.29.
