AUSTRALIAN shares rallied 1.1 per cent yesterday as surprisingly good company earnings lifted sentiment in the market.  Despite a mixed lead from Wall Street, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 rose 35.7 points to 3448.9.   The All Ordinaries was up 31.1 points to 3398. EL&amp;C Baillieu director Richard Morrow said investors were relieved to see the US market perform as well as it had, given growing concerns over the bad debts exposure of western European banks to eastern and central European economies. 'Today is just a relief rally,' Mr Morrow said. 'The world is still spinning on its axis and not barrelling out into space.' In the US overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose for the second consecutive session, closing up 0.04 per cent at 7555.63.   The index was, however, within 4 points of its lowest close in 5 1/2 years   CMC Markets senior dealer Dominic Vaughan said the local market rose on the strength of profit results from companies such as Santos. 'It's a case of better than expected numbers,' Mr Vaughan said. 'Investors liked what they saw with the profit results and it gave the market some much needed boost.' Santos closed 1.3 per cent higher at$14.41 after it delivered a significant increase in profit and said it was well placed amid the global economic crisis.   Sims Metal Management rose 4 per cent to $17.27 despite reporting a first-half net loss of $79.4 million, compared with a net profit of $139.4 million a year earlier. Investors focused on the scrap recycling company's comments on signs of improvement in key metal prices and the liquidity of its trading partners. In the resources sector, Rio Tinto rose 2.4 per cent to $51.78 amid growing shareholder unrest over its deal with Chinalco. BHP Billiton dropped 0.5 per cent to $30.16.   The major banks were higher despite big falls in their US counterparts overnight. Westpac gained 3.2 per cent to $17, ANZ rose 1.6 per cent to $12.60, Commonwealth Bank added 2.4 per cent to $29.85 and National Australia Bank advanced 1.4 per cent to $18.40.   IG Markets' Ben Potter said the market's recent strong performance relative to its peers would end soon. 'There is only so long we can outperform,' Mr Potter said. 'Once the support of better than expected company reports dries up, we'll see the local market recoupling with the bearish global trend. There simply aren't enough bullish drivers, especially considering our banks are now more expensive versus their global peers.' But CMC Markets' Mr Vaughan said the finance sector seemed to be good value for investors at the moment, and despite some reports of increasing provision for bad debts he did not think that was something to be afraid of.   The major retailers were stronger. Woolworths added 5c to $27.50, David Jones increased 6c to $2.41 and Wesfarmers added 79c to $17.09.   Additional reporting: AAP
