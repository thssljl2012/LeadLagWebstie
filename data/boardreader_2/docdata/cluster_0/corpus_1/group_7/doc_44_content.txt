AUSTRALIAN shares opened lower today after big falls in US and European markets and further weakness in base metal prices. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 slipped 41 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 3361.4 in the first 20 minutes of trading.   The broader All Ordinaries fell 36.80 points to 3316.2.   Weakness in the diversified mining sector outweighed gains in gold stocks after sharp falls in base metals on Friday.   Copper tumbled to lose nearly 8 per cent on the week while aluminium crumbled to its lowest level in six years in the face of rising stockpiles and a deteriorating economic outlook.   BHP Billiton fell 3.4 per cent to $29.46 and Rio Tinto lost 4 per cent to $48.29.   Newcrest Mining rose 2.9 per cent to $33.97 and Lihir piled on 3.5 per cent to $3.52 after the gold price punched above $US1000 an ounce for the first time in almost a year as investors sought shelter in safe-haven investments.   Banks were a considerable drag on the market after a sell-off in US financial stocks amid rumours the government will nationalise Citigroup and Bank of America, which the White House denied.   European banks weakened as worries intensified over institutions with exposure to the fast-contracting eastern and central European economies.   Commonwealth Bank fell 1.2 per cent to $29.21, ANZ dropped 1 per cent to $12.32 and Westpac slipped 0.2 per cent to $16.35. National Australia Bank firmed 0.5 per cent to $18.10.  BlueScope Steel fell 6.1 per cent to $2.93 despite first-half net profit rising more than threefold to $407 million on increased sales and after taking charges in the previous corresponding period.  But the profit result missed expectations and it forecast underlying full-year result could be a loss if the economy continued to worsen.   Fairfax fell 1.4 per cent to $1.04 after the media group swung to a $365.3 million net loss in the first half after restructuring charges and writing down the value of its mastheads.   Billabong firmed 0.3 per cent to $6.34 after Credit Suisse and Citi upgraded their recommendations for the surfwear retailer on the grounds its share price had been oversold.   Credit Suisse values Billabong at $8.96 a share and has 12-month price target at $9.57 compared with Billabongs closing price on Friday of $6.32.   Billabong last week reported a widely expected 7 per cent slide in first-half net profit.   Caltex slumped 5.7 per cent to $8.30 after Credit Suisse downgraded the stock to underperform from outperform in anticipation of tough conditions in the oil refining sector over the next one to two years.   The oil refiner last week reported a 95 per cent plunge in annual profit and declared no final dividend after the steep fall in the oil price decimated the value of its stockpiles.
