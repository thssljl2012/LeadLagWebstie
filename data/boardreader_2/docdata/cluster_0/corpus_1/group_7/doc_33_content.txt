THE major banks paced declines in the market yesterday amid renewed concerns over the British and European financial sectors. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 closed down 52.6 points, or 1.5 per cent, to 3464.3, while the All Ordinaries was down 49.10 points to 3412.2.   Mixed corporate results, sharp falls in Asian markets and a negative lead from US futures trading also weighed on stocks.   Late yesterday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 3 per cent and Japan's Nikkei 225 was lower by 1.5 per cent.   Dow Jones futures were down 104 points, pointing to a sharp fall on Wall Street last night.   Marcus Padley, publisher of Marcus Today, said investors were nervous about British banks and insurers. He said Lloyds bank fell 32 per cent on Friday and 8 per cent on Monday and there were suggestions it might need to be nationalised. 'There's also concerns about Legal&amp;General in the UK insurance sector, so local insurance stocks are all weaker today,' he said. The Australian dollar also fell yesterday after a sharp rise in the US dollar, particularly against the euro, dragged the Aussie down to US64.14c, the local unit's poorest finish since February 3, when it ended the day at US63.60c.   HiFX senior consultant Derek Mumford said the Aussie backpedalled after the euro broke through a key level against the US dollar during afternoon trade. 'It was nothing specific about the Aussie dollar, it was dragged down I think on the euro move,' Mr Mumford said. NAB led the market lower on concerns Lloyds could be forced to write down more loans made by its unit HBOS after figures showed many of the loans were worth a fraction of their original value. Investors are worried NAB could be exposed to more bad and doubtful debts through its British loan book. Its shares dived 3.7 per cent to $17.88.   At the same time, there are growing concerns over eurozone banks which have loans outstanding in Central and Eastern Europe amounting to $US1.3trillion ($2tn), according to the Bank for International Settlements.   ANZ fell 4.3 per cent to $12.42, CBA dropped 2.1 per cent to $29.01 and Westpac shed 0.9 per cent to $16.78.   In the resources sector, OZ Minerals snagged a spot amid the 10 best performers, surging 17.3 per cent to 64.5c after it agreed to a highly conditional $2.6bn takeover offer from China MinMetals.   BHP Billiton slipped 1.3 per cent to $31.72 and Rio Tinto gave up 1.4 per cent to $50.07.   Pure Energy soared 11.8 per cent to $8.36 after BG Group sweetened its bid to $8 cash, trumping Arrow Energy's increased bid of $3 and 1.57 of its shares per Pure share. Arrow rose 6.7 per cent to $4.76.   PaperlinX was the star performer on the ASX200, soaring 100 per cent to 65c after selling its paper manufacturing division to Japan's Nippon Paper for $600m.   Brambles slumped 14.3 per cent to $4.84 after Macquarie, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Citi downgraded their Brambles recommendations.   Additional reporting: AAP
