(Adds broker comment, stocks on the move)  MELBOURNE, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 2.7 percent on Wednesday, led by top miners and energy stocks after copper and oil prices fell on more signs of a deepening global recession. BHP Billiton , the world's biggest global miner, and rival Rio Tinto  both fell more than 4 percent. 'The economic data on the global front continues to get worse, and the Australian economy is slowing very quickly. So I think you need to start factoring in further weakness for equity markets globally,' said Savanth Sebastian, equities economist at broker CommSec.  While more red alerts emerged on the health of European banks, Australia's second-largest bank, Westpac Banking Corp , highlighted the resilience of local banks, reporting a steady first-quarter profit despite a steep rise in bad debts.  Westpac shares fell 2.7 percent, in line with the broader market, while National Australia Bank  and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group  fell around 1.5 percent.  The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200  shed 93.1 points to 3,371.2 by 0015 GMT, extending a 1.5 percent slide on Tuesday.  New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index  traded down 1.8 percent at 2,624.9.
