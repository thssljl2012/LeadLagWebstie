(Adds comment, updates banks, indices)  SYDNEY, Feb 23 (Reuters) - Australian stocks came off early lows on Monday to stand 1.1 pct lower, as banking shares recovered after a Wall Street Journal report that the U.S. government may acquire up to 40 percent of Citigroup's common stock. [nHKG82766] 'I think that's the rumour that people are running with. Certainly it's helping the market higher, it's certainly helping Japan higher,' said Lisa Jarvis, private client adviser at ABN AMRO Morgans. 'I think obviously what is expected is a rally in the bank stocks in America, and that's reflected in the banking stocks here,' Jarvis said. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 index  stood 1.1 points lower at 3,364.8 at 0315 GMT, having fallen to as low as 3,312.6.  New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index  fell 1.4 percent to 2,540.2.
