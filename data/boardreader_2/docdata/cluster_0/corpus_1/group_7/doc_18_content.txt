Stocks of companies with large US-based businesses also declined because of delays in the US government's rescue bill.  At 1025 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 6.3 points, or 0.18 per cent, at 3,502.3, while the broader All Ordinaries index fell 4.7 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 3,441.1.  The spot price of gold was $US893.95 an ounce, down $US13.75 on Monday's local close of $US907.70 an ounce. Goldminers fell, with Newcrest losing 35 cents, or 1.09 per cent, to $31.85, Lihir declining seven cents, or 2.21 per cent, to $3.10 and Sino Gold retreating 19 cents, or 3.77 per cent, to $4.85.  Among the major banks, Commonwealth Bank of Australia added five cents to $29.99, Westpac fell 21 cents to $16.31, National Australia Bank declined nine cents to $18.81 and ANZ slipped 17 cents to $12.29.  Companies with large exposures to the US consumer market fell before a speech on Tuesday by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner outlining President Barack Obama's plan to overhaul the government's $700 billion financial bailout package.  Republicans and Democrats have been at odds over the plan, which is designed to help pull the economy out of the worst recession in decades.  Westfield fell 25 cents, or 2.21 per cent, to $11.05, Brambles lost 10 cents, or 1.59 per cent, to $6.17, James Hardie declined five cents, or 1.39 per cent, to $3.56 and News Corp dropped 22 cents, or 1.96 per cent, to $11.03.  Macquarie Equities associate director Lucinda Chan said investors were reluctant to trade stocks before the US stimulus package became more certain.  'Everyone still is waiting for more details from the US,'' she said.  That uncertainty, and concern about the US economy's performance had hurt stocks which have a large portion of their business there, Ms Chan said.  'People still look towards the US because it is the biggest economy.''  Ms Chan also said the gold miners had fallen after the price of the metal fell.  Following the gold price is 'much the trend in the gold miners,'' she said.  BHP Billiton, the largest company on the Australian Securities Exchange, fell eleven cents, or 0.33 per cent, to $33.23, while Rio Tinto slipped 92 cents, or 1.86 per cent, to $48.48.
