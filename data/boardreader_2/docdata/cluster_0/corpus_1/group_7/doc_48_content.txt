SYDNEY, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Australian stocks are expected to fall on Thursday, with bank shares seen pressured after Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd flagged a 25 percent cut in its 2009 dividend. The country's dominant telco Telstra Corp Ltd is also likely to be in focus after the company said its controversial boss Sol Trujillo would depart on June 30. March share price index (SPI) futures fell 10 points to 3,317 points, a 10-point discount to Thursday's close in the underlying share index, when the market dipped 0.1 percent. Strong gains in oil prices could boost energy stocks such as Woodside Petroleum Ltd and Santos Ltd, offering some support to the broader market. Westfield, the world's top shopping mall owner, reported a 10.4 percent rise in its operating profit and reiterated its distribution forecasts. Fortescue Metals Group Ld, Australia's third-biggest iron ore miner, will also be in focus as its shares resume trading after Chinese steel mill Hunan Valin Iron and Steel Group bought a 16.5 percent stake in Fortescue for A$1.2 billion. But Fortescue scrapped a planned A$500 million share issue late on Wednesday. ANZ, Australia's fourth-biggest lender, said in a trading update that it would cut its 2009 dividend by about 25 percent and saw full-year cash profit steady on a year ago. Brewer Lion Nathan Ltd has its annual shareholder meeting. New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index rose 0.3 percent at 2,507.3 in early trade. ----------------------MARKET SNAPSHOT @ 2131 GMT ------------ INSTRUMENT LAST PCT CHG NET CHG S&amp;P 500 764.9 -1.07% -8.240 USD/JPY 97.54 0.92% 0.890 10-YR US TSY YLD 2.9373 -- 0.137 SPOT GOLD 950.7 -1.22% -11.750 US CRUDE 42.42 6.16% 2.460 DOW JONES 7270.89 -1.09% -80.05 ASIA ADRS 80.95 -1.32% -1.08 ------------------------------------------------------------- * Wall St falls on economic woes * Oil jumps 6 percent on U.S. gasoline stock draw * Gold drops below $950/oz, volatility seen * Copper ends up as Bernanke boosts sentiment For a digest of the day's business stories in Australian newspapers, double click on ((Australia/New Zealand bureaux; +61 2 9373 1800/+64 4 471 4234)) DIARIES &amp; DATA: IPO diary &amp; data Asia earnings diary U.S. earnings diary European diary Australia diary Wall Street Week Ahead Eurostocks Week Ahead ................................................................
