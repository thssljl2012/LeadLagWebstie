Bloomberg reports today that the stimulus package the U.S. Congress is completing would raise the governments commitment to solving the financial crisis to $9.7 trillion, enough to pay off more than 90 percent of the nations home mortgages.  The Federal Reserve, Treasury Department and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have lent or spent almost $3 trillion over the past two years and pledged to provide up to $5.7 trillion more if needed. The total already tapped has decreased about 1 percent since November, mostly because foreign central banks are using fewer dollars in currency-exchange agreements called swaps.

That measure would need to be reconciled with an $819 billion plan the House approved last month.  In New York, investors were disappointed that the Obama administration, delayed an announcement on its new bank bailout plan until Tuesday.
