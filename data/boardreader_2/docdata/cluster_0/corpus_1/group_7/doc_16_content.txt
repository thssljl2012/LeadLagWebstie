IG Markets head of dealing Oliver Stevens said the local market had not been helped by a speech in the US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner outlining President Barack Obama's plan to overhaul the government's $US700 billion financial bailout package.  'It looked like we were going to open up higher and we just drifted off,' Mr Stevens said.  'We've seen Asian markets and US futures drift off overnight as well.  'It's disappointing.'  Locally, Mr Stevens said company reports had been very weak of late, undermining investor confidence.  'There is concern that we've seen so many capital raisings, which has really shocked the market.  'Everyone seems to have come out asking for money and no one is prepared to believe in a rally until we see an end of that.'
