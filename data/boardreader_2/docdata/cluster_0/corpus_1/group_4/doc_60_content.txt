Australian shares are sliding after W Street plunged almost 400 points in its last hour of trade on more bad economic news.  In early trade, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index had fen as much as 3.2%, or 106.5 points, to 3246.4.  The Australian dollar also sagged, buying 60.9 US cents recently, more than 2 US cents down on yesterday's local close of 63.52 US cents. It was also buying 57.34 yen.  ''The sell-off is across the board,'' said James Drohan of Ord Minnett. ''There is no light at the end of the tunnel at this point and time.''''We're basicy following the US market.''  Jobless claims in the US jumped by 27,000 last week, while the number of American workers filing new employment claims hit a 16 year high overnight. The data shows the US recession will be ''deeper and more prolonged'' than earlier though, said Mr Drohan. And that's driving sharemarkets around the world to new lows.  Commodities plunge  Mining stocks were sharply lower after the closely watched Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of commodity prices fing 4.2%. BHP shares dropped 4.5%, or 95 cents, to $20.15, while shares in Rio Tinto were down 4.4%, or $2.51, to $54.74.  Woodside Petroleum lost 10.1%, or $3.10, to $27.55, and Newcrest Mining was down 2.2%, or 42 cents, to $18.53.  However, shares in Fortescue Metals surged 14.7%, or 19 cents, to $1.48 after it said it had increased sales to China.  ''Everyday investors aren't prepared to watch their investment portfolios continue to drop and they're just going to walk away,'' said Mr Drohan.   ''In this market investors are definitely going to learn a lot about themselves and what they can take and what they can't take.''  ''Anyone who still has a margin lending account, will just be getting margin c after margin.'' ''And that will create forced selling.''  ''It's looking pretty gloomy.''  Dow dives  Banking shares also weighed on the index, with the Commonwealth Bank losing 3.8%, or $1.10, to $28.21, ANZ fell 4.5%, or 58 cents, to $12.42, and National Australia Bank tumbled 3.2%, or 60 cents, to $18.22.W Street zig-zagged in late-afternoon trade as jobs claims surged. It even rebounded briefly on increasing confidence that the US government will provide aid to the auto industry. (See story here)  In the last hour of its session, the Dow nosedived, dropping 436.79 points, or 5.46%, to close at 7560.49.  The Nasdaq shed 70.32 points, or 5.07%, to 1316.10, bringing its value down by half since the beginning of the year. The Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 plummeted 53.49 points, or 6.63%, to a preliminary close of 753.09, the lowest finish in a decade.   The end of the market sell-offs in the US may be driven by hedge fund redemptions, Mr Kerslake said. By 3 pm in the trading day, managers know how much money they must raise to give back to investors who are requesting it, and that sets off a renewed burst of selling.  Rate cut  Expectations of a full percentage point cut to the interest rate solidified overnight, with the market now considering it a near certainty that the Reserve Bank will chop the official interest rate down to 4.25% when it meets in the first week of December, according to Credit Suisse.  A similar index forecasts that the interest rate will have fen to 3% with 12 months.  And there's even a one-in-two chance that the RBA will make a decision outside of its regularly scheduled meetings that occur every month but January.  With the financial crisis forcing economists to reassess the outlook on a weekly basis, analysts haven't ruled out such a move from the RBA, which acted as it did in 1990 and 1992.   A spokesman for the RBA said the bank has no plans to do so, but 'But there's nothing to preclude the bank from meeting in January.'czappone@fairfax.com.au  BusinessDay, with AAP
