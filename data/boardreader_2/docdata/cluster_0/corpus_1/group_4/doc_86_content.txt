 LONDON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - European shares edged up on Friday, recouping losses, as U.S. stock futures stemmed an earlier slide and German stocks gained, fueled by strength in the shares of Volkswagen. By 1306 GMT the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.2 percent at 905.18 points. Germany's DAX was up 1.4 percent, outperforming both Britain's FTSE 100 and France's CAC, which fell between 1 and 1.2 percent., Banks, led by Barclays and HSBC, were still the largest drag on the market, while an 8.7 percent gain in Volkswagen pushed up the auto sector. U.S. stock futures were still showing a loss on the day, trading between -0.6 and -1.7 percent, but recovered from earlier session lows, which in turn helped boost European equities.
