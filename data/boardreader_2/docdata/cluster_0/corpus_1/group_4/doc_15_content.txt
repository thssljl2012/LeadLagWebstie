The Australian stock market was lower shortly after noon, following a weak lead overnight from Wall Street, although the prospect of another cut in official interest rates and a horse race are likely to dominate investors' attention today.  Shortly after noon, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 1.93%, or 81.3 points, to 4140.2. The broader All Ordinaries index was down 1.77%, or 73.9 points, to 4099.1.  Shares were down across all sectors, with the big miners leading the falls. However, some of the banks recoved from earlier losses and were trading higher.  BHP Billiton shares were down $1.24, or 4.1%, to $28.66, Rio Tinto fell $2.96, or 3.6%, to $79.04 and Fortescue Metals was down 7 cents to $2.91.  The banks were mixed, with the Commonwealth Bank down 35 cents, or 0.8%, to $41.49, ANZ up 4 cents, or 0.2%, to $18.54, NAB down 9 cents, or 0.4%, to $25.01, Westpac up 53 cents, to 2.5%, to $22.00 and St George up 50 cents, or 1.7%, to $29.60.  Shares in Macquarie Group were down 95 cents, or 2.9%, to $32.10.  MF Global institutional equities dealer Sam Willis said trading volumes were thin ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia's interest rate decision.  The Melbourne Cup also was preoccupying investors, Mr Willis said.  'Compounding that is (that) we've had a couple of good, strong days and people are happy to take some money off the table,'' he said.  'Coming from our offshore office out of Chicago, they see with the US election ... just (achieving) an outcome is going to buoy the stock market to start off with, but if the Democrats were to win, then there would be even more of a relief rally.  'Then to compound that further, if the Democrats secure more seats in the Senate, we (will) see the stock market being a little stronger.''  Mr Willis said metals were being widely ignored ahead of the US election and amid market turmoil.  'If the Democrats do get in and we see this relief rally, I think metals will be buoyed,'' he said.  The gold miners were lower. Lihir lost 3 cents, or 1.5%, to $1.97 and Newcrest was down 45 cents, or 2.1%, to $20.79.  Energy stocks were also weaker - Santos was down 24 cents, or 1.7%, to $13.74 and Woodside Petroleum lost 85 cents, or 2%, to $41.56.  Among the retailers, Harvey Norman was up 16 cent, or 6%, to $2.86, Wesfarmers was down $1.41, or 5.8%, to $22.94 and Woolworths lost 92 cents, or 3.1%, to $28.71.
