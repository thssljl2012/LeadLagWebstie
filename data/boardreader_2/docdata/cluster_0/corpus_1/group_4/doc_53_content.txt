(Adds details)  By Mette Fraende and Denny Thomas  SYDNEY, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 4 percent on Thursday as concerns about a prolonged global recession triggered sharp losses in leading miners BHP Billiton  and Rio Tinto . Analysts said weak oil prices and fears over the troubled U.S. automakers helped drag down the wider market, which has now lost nearly half its value since the beginning of the year. 'The oil price has been coming off...with a weak market, it's all bringing it back down. There was a lot of talk around that the oil price might even come lower, as demand subsides due to the many countries coming into recession,' said Martin Angel, dealer at Patersons Securities Ltd. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index  lost 146.7 points to 3,352.9, based on the latest available data, off the day's low of 3,340.3, its weakest since February 2004.  New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index  ended down 2.3 percent at 2,644.7. 'You've got the situation with the automakers on Capitol Hill at present trying to get extra funds. If they don't end up getting those extra funds, the market will take that very negatively,' Angel said. Companies geared to global growth such as miners BHP Billiton and its takeover target, Rio Tinto, were hit hard on worries that the global economic slowdown had ended the commodities boom.  BHP tumbled 9 percent to A$21.10 and Rio Tinto 13 percent to A$57.25, but there was some more upbeat news after the close, when Australia's third-largest iron ore miner, Fortescue Metals , said it had secured more Chinese demand for next year.  Miner Territory Resources  fell 31 percent to A$0.10 after it said it faced difficulties selling iron ore on the spot market for delivery in early December because of declining demand from China's steel mills. Oz Minerals Ltd's , the world's second-largest zinc miner and a major supplier of copper, was down 16.7 percent to A$0.53, joining some of its larger peers. The firm warned this week of lower profits and possible asset writedowns.  Australia's largest banks joined the downturn on concerns they might need to further increase provisions due to their exposure to troubled companies such Centro Properties Group  and Babcock &amp;amp; Brown Ltd . Babcock shares were placed on trading halt due to a dispute the company had with a bank. [nSYU005565].  National Australia Bank Ltd , Australia's top lender, slipped 4.4 percent to A$18.82, Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd , the No. 2 lender, lost 5.2 percent to A$29.31. The third largest lender, Westpac  fell 4.0 percent fall to A$15.60, and No. 4 lender Australia and New Zealand Banking Group  closed 5.9 percent down at A$13.00.  Property-related stocks defied the sell-off, after weeks of declines. AustraLand  rose 10.8 percent to A$0.36 and Abacus Property Group  1.8 percent at A$0.28.
