(RTTNews) - The stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region tumbled on Thursday after U.S. stocks hit their lowest levels in more than five years overnight. The Japanese market slumped, with the key Nikkei index losing nearly 7% to trade below the 8,000 mark for the first time in three weeks. Fears about a long drawn and deep recession heightened after the Federal Reserve slashed its U.S. growth forecasts, U.S. consumer prices fell at a record pace last month, and Japan's October exports fell by the most in seven years. Oil prices fell for a fifth day on Thursday amid concerns about a slowing demand.  U.S. stocks tumbled on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average plunging below the 8,000 mark for the first time since 2003. The Dow closed down 427.5 points or 5.1% at 7,997.3, the Nasdaq shed 96.9 points or 6.5% to 1,386.4 and the S&amp;amp;P 500 dropped 52.5 points or 6.1% to 806.6.

Exports for the month were down 7.7% on year, while imports jumped an annual 7.4%.

The Chinese market closed lower, as investors locked in profits from Wednesday's rally. Losses among banks and insurers offset gains among property developers and gold miners. Shanghai-based property developers rose after a report said that the Shanghai government is in the final stages of negotiating an agreement to open a Walt Disney theme park in the city.

On the economic front, the Reserve Bank of Australia said that it had bought A$3.15 billion in net spot foreign exchange transactions in the market in October after 78 consecutive months of net sales of Australian dollars.
