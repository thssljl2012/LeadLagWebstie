The Australian share market closed more than four per cent lower today, led by the miners.  The banking sector was also weaker with three of the majors, Commonwealth Bank and ANZ, revealing big exposures to failed Australian businesses.  The media sector did not escape the carnage with News Corp reporting a 21 per cent downgrade on its full year outlook less than 24 hours after disappointing results from WA Newspapers.  The rout followed an overnight slump on Wall Street as investors worried about the global financial crisis and a US recession. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index slumped 186.9 points, or 4.31 per cent, to close at 4,149.7 while the broader All Ordinaries index declined 180.8 points, or 4.22 per cent, to 4106.5.  Aequs Securities institutional dealer Ric Klusman said the market had slumped because of continuing concern that the world economy was slowing, which would drag down Australia.  Its pretty messy, he said.  The fears for the economy and slowdown in growth are hurting, so BHP (Billiton) is down.  It followed a sharp and bitter US sell-off, and US futures are indicating another fall tonight.  The world's biggest miner BHP dropped $2.40, or 7.59 per cent, to $29.20 while its takeover target Rio Tinto shed $7.56, or 8.73 per cent, to $79.04.  Overnight, commodities including oil and copper tumbled, indicating more fears that demand will slow.  News Corp plunged $3.40, or 21.4 per cent, to an 11-year low $12.50.  He (Rupert Murdoch) didnt help things by downgrading the earnings expectations, Mr Klusman said.  The banks slumped, led by ANZ, on concerns about their exposure to failing companies.
