THE share market opened around 1.5 per cent lower this morning, as resource stocks declined after falls overnight in commodity prices on fears of global slowdown. At 10.20am (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 57.8 points, or 1.46 per cent, at 3903.1 while the broader All Ordinaries declined 56.9 points, or 1.45 per cent, to 3864.9.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index futures contract was 67 points lower at 3926 on a volume of 5730 contracts.  Commodities including oil, gold and copper declined overnight, together with equities around the world, on fears the slowing economy will dent demand for materials.  Light, sweet crude for December delivery fell $US3.08 to settle at $US59.33 a barrel in New York and reached its lowest price since March 2007 in intraday trading.  BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, which produce oil as well as other commodities, both declined.  BHP dropped 48 cents, or 1.67 per cent, to $28.32, while its takeover target Rio declined $2.47, or 3.23 per cent, to $74.02.  Energy producers also fell, with Woodside losing $1.04 to $38.96, Oil Search declining eleven cents, or 2.2 per cent, to $4.88 and Santos slipping 16 cents to $13.47. At 10.24am (AEDT), spot gold in Sydney was at $US732.50 an ounce, down $US13.60 on yesterday's local close of $US746.10.  The gold miners declined, with Newcrest Mining down 72 cents, or 3.25 per cent, to $21.41 and Lihir Gold losing three cents to $1.98.  Austock Securities senior client adviser Michael Heffernan said the poor commodities market, as well as declines in US equities, had caused local shares to decline. 'The resource stocks are getting pounded again,' Mr Heffernan said. 'Rio is in the situation where it does have a bit more debt than BHP, and debt is deadly at the moment, and any company with debt is simply not favoured by the market.' Overnight, Wall Street took another clobbering as the reality hit investors that few industries are safe from the consumer spending slump.  The Dow Jones industrial average shed 1.99 per cent to close at 8,693.96.  The banks, which have led declines in the market this year, were little changed today.  NAB lost five cents to $20.10, Commonwealth Bank rose 23 cents to 35.84, ANZ dropped one cent to $15.67 and Westpac added five cents to $19.35.
