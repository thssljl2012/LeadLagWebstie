LONDON, Oct. 31 (Xinhua) -- Britain's leading share index ended up two percent on Friday, capping its best ever week, despite some big name casualties. The FTSE 100 index rose 85.69 points, or 2.0 percent, to close at 4,377.34, notching up around 700 points on the week. But the benchmark still ended October down nearly 10.7 percent -- the worst monthly loss since the 1987 market crash. Telecoms giant BT was the biggest loser with a 19 percent fall after saying quarterly earnings fro the global services division would be 'significantly below expectations.' Also among the list of wounded, Barclays plunged 13 percent on news that it intends to raise 7.3 billion pounds from overseas rather than accept terms of a government loan. Oil and gas producers led gains as BP was up 2.6 percent, Royal Dutch Shell added 3.8 percent and Cairn Energy rose 3.5 percent. Miners also surged, with Xstrata, Vedanta Resources and Anglo American rising between 6.5 and 9.9 percent. ?
