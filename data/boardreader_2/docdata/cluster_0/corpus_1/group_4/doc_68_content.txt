(Adds details, comments)  By Denny Thomas  SYDNEY, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 2.3 percent on Wednesday as Rio Tinto Ltd  hit a four-year closing low after BHP Billiton Ltd  dropped its takeover offer, while the market's recent rise encouraged some investors to take profits in banks.  BHP rose on relief that it would not have to take on massive debt to buy Rio, but other commodity stocks, such as Woodside Petroleum Ltd , fell due to lower oil prices. 'It's relief that BHP's strong financial position wouldn't be jeopardised by paying a large premium, and effectively a large value transfer from BHP shareholders to Rio shareholders,' said FW Holst analyst Rob Craigie.  The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index  lost 83.4 points to 3,540.0, based on the latest available data, after rising 8.1 percent in the previous three sessions. It had jumped 5.8 percent on Tuesday for its biggest one-day percentage gain since October 1997.  New Zealand shares ended steady at 2,637.9 points.  Rio plunged 34.3 percent to A$42.01, its lowest close since December 2004 and the biggest ever one-day percentage drop, according to Reuters data, after BHP abruptly withdrew its planned takeover (see [nSYD328655]).  BHP rose 3.9 percent to A$27.25.  Woodside, Australia's biggest independent oil producer, dropped 4.8 percent to A$31.90 and Santos Ltd  lost 3.9 percent to A$14.00 pressured by oil's 7 percent fall on Tuesday.  Banks, which led the recent uptrend along with miners, fell back. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd  lost 3.4 percent to A$14.05 and Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd  shed 3.9 percent to A$32.66.  Fund managers said the market could come under pressure due to possible equity raisings, such as one announced by QBE Insurance Group Ltd  on Wednesday, or profit downgrades like the one issued by Qantas Airways Ltd  on Tuesday. 'We're still in an environment where we're probably going to see continued downgrades and equity raisings at the margin. So there's still going to be tough times for a little while,' Tim Schroeders, a fund manager at Pengana Capital said.  Qantas, Australia's top airline, fell 3.1 percent to A$2.17, adding to Tuesday's 3.0 percent loss when it lowered its current fiscal year profit forecast.  Toll road operator ConnectEast Group  sank 24.3 percent to A$0.485 as it resumed trading after raising A$295 million through an institutional share placement. The shares dropped below the offer price of A$0.55 each. Fairfax Media Ltd  rebounded to trade up 0.8 percent at A$1.30 after saying it had no current need to raise equity.  The stock had fallen as much as 13.6 percent earlier in the session, prompting a query from the stock exchange [nSYU005608]. Fairfax linked the fall to speculation of an equity raising.  Elsewhere, NRW Holdings Ltd , an engineering contractor, slumped 37.1 percent to A$0.28 after Fortescue Metals Group Ltd  halted construction work on a rail line from its mine site in Western Australia. Fortescue fell 16.1 percent at A$1.72. ($1=A$1.53) (Editing by Jonathan Standing)
