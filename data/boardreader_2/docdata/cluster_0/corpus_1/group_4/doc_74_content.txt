'It is a bit disappointing, given the US market was wishy-washy, but it wasn't significantly down,' Mr Heffernan said.  When BHP and Rio began trading, he said, BHP could pull the market into positive territory.  'We haven't seen the blockbuster from BHP hit the screens yet.  'I think when that happens we might see a bit of a reversal in the pretty lacklustre performance that we've seen so far.  'It will be like a see-saw with a fat person on one end and a skinnier person on the other ... I think you could say BHP is the fat person.  'So that will hold sway and I think that will cause a net positive injection to the market, more so than the negative from Rio.'  But Mr Heffernan said concerns about global financial markets persisted, as highlighted by BHP pulling out of the deal.  'While it's going to be positive for BHP when it opens, the reason they are withdrawing from it will cause a few qualms for people looking at the long term,' he said.
