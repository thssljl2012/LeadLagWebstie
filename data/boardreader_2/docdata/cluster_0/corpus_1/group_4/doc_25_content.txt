The Australian sharemarket was stronger at noon, up more than two per cent, driven by China's massive economic stimulus plan, which has boosted appetite among local investors for commodity based stocks.  Also, the Reserve Bank of Australia has indicated there is more work to be done in cutting interest rates as it tries to strike the balance between stemming slower economic growth and curbing inflation.  At 1219 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was up 87.4 points, or 2.16 per cent, at 4,138.7 while the broader All Ordinaries index had advanced 85.7 points, or 2.14 per cent, to 4,092.3.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index futures contract had added 46 points to 4,170 on a volume of 24,033 contracts.  CommSec market analyst Juliette Saly said China's plan was equivalent to almost $A900 billion or 86 per cent of Australia's GDP.  'We've heard from Rio Tinto this morning, which will cut its iron ore output by 10 per cent due to slowing demand from China, however, this stimulus plans signals that next year, we may see a pick up in production,' Ms Saly said.  'The entire materials sector is certainly lifting the market and is up by 6.5 per cent.  'We're also seeing some good growth coming through from the energy sector, up by more than four per cent, following a slight pick up in the price of crude oil.'  Mining giant BHP Billiton had surged $1.95, or 6.98 per cent, to $29.88 at 1221 AEDT while its takeover target Rio Tinto had gained $4.93, or 6.82 per cent, to $77.20.

'The financial sector was down by about half a per cent,' Ms Saly said.  'NAB has been placed in trading halt as it tries to raise $2 billion in capital through an institutional share placement offer.  'There are rumour that those shares are being offered at a 10 per cent discount at $20 per share.  'There are concerns other banks may be forced to do the same.
