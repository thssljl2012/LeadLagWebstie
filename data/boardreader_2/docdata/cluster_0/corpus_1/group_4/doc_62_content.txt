Economists warn there are increasing concerns the global recession will be deep and very damaging. The only question on the lips of traders is when will we hit the bottom? 'Any remaining confidence in global markets has been well and truly trampled on today as investors throw in the towel,' said David Evans, an analyst at BetOnMarkets.com. 'After months of bailouts, mini rallies, more bailouts and false dawns, investors have had enough.' 'There has been a panicked flight to quality today as the yield on the shortest-term US treasury bonds sinks to near zero,' he added. 'Money is flooding to what is perceived to the safest haven in these troubled times.'The Australian dollar fell another 3.5 per cent overnight to start todays local session at US61.29c, before falling to a four-week low of US60.80c by 7.40am AEDT.   The Reserve Bank this morning said it had intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the Australian dollar as it fell under US61c. 'Yes, we provided liquidity as on previous occassions,'' an RBA spokesman said. 'We don't disclose when, nor do we disclose the level.''   The RBA last intervened in the foreign exchange market on November 13, when the Australian dollar fell to US63.50c, and on October 28, when the currency fell to a five and a half year low of US60.12c.   In late October, the central bank spent $3.15 billion propping up the Australian dollar, a bigger amount than in early 2001 when the unit hit an all-time low of US47.78c.   with AFP and news.com.au
