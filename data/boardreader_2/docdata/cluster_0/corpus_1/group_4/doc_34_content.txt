World crude oil prices dropped below $57/barrel today after a Bank of England warning about the risk of deflation--a decrease in all commodity prices--stoked fears of stagnating global growth. The cyclical peak for world crude was $137/barrel in July, . The monthly average price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil in the U.S. fell from above $133/barrel in July to about $77 in October, and has slipped even more. EIA has forecast the 2009 price at $63.50. However, Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabr Al-Thani, says that fair crude oil prices of between $70 to $90 per barrel would ensure that expensive oil exploration could continue and help to avert price spikes in the future. Other analysts think thats too high. Phil Flynn, an analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago, now expects the crude oil market will find a bottom of around $50 a barrel or slightly lower in 2009 before prices slowly work their way back up. 'At some point, prices will go back up, but the big question is when, and that's when the economy bounces back,' . Mark Pervan, senior commodity strategist with ANZ Bank in Melbourne is even more bearish, expecting world crude prices to fall to $45 a barrel during the first quarter of next year.
