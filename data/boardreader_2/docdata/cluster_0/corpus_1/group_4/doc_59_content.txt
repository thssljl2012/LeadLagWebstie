Australian shares rebounded from five-year lows as investors wagered that sharp falls this week had made many stocks a bargain.  Entering the last half hour of trading, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index was up 26.8 points, or 0.8%, at 3379.7, after earlier dropping more than 4% to 3217.5 - a level not seen since December 17, 2003. The All Ordinaries also pared its losses, trading up 0.8% for the day, or 25.8 points, to 3358.  David Spry, research manager at FW Holst &amp;amp; Co, said the late-session surge looked like a typical 'bear market rally,' adding 'there are still too many headwinds out there' for the turnaround to be sustained. 'It wouldn't surprise me if the market rallied 500 points starting next week,' he said. Even so, 'until we get transparency on (company earnings) it will be very difficult to get significant upward momentum.' Wall Street provided the main prompt for the early weakness in the local market. Doubts about a rescue package for the big three US car makers and renewed worries about the economy sent the broad S&amp;amp;P 500 share index down almost 7% overnight to its lowest level since 1997.  The Australian dollar also regained ground in recent trading, buying 61.91 US cents, still more about 1.5 US cents lower on yesterday's local close of 63.52 US cents. The Reserve Bank disclosed earlier today that it had intervened to buy Aussie dollars.  Across the region, Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index were both off their lows, trading 0.8% and 4,.5% higher for the day, respectively. The US market was also pointed higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures up 2.3%.  Banks bounce  The Commonwealth Bank recovered all its losses to trade up 68 cents, or 2.3% for the day, at $29.99, while the ANZ Bank was also up, gaining 36 cents, or 2.8% at $13.36. , though, was still 13 cents, or 0.7% lower, at $18.69. Westpac was up 39 cents, or 2.5% at $15.99.
