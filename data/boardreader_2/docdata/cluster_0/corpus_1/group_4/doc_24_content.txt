Australian shares fell sharply in morning trade, erasing all of November's early gains, after investors interpreted big interest rate cuts in Europe as a cause for worry.  In late morning trade, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index sank 164.6 points, or 4%, to 3985.1 points, falling below the mark of 4000 for the first time this month. The S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 closed at 4001 at the end of October, the worst month on record for Australian shares since the crash of 1987.  The Bank of England's huge 1.5 percentage point cut failed to bolster the the British market. Instead it rekindled fears for Australian property values, said Bell Potter Securities' Chris Kimber.  'The rate cut in London is massive,' he said. 'But it makes people worry about the state of our own property market here.'  Drops of 10%-20% in Australian property values may 'look a little more likely,' he said.  The UK obviously needed to make the slash its interest rates to promote growth. '1.5% over there was enough to cause a panic.'  Shares in BHP Billiton led the dive, falling as much as $2.54, or 8.7%, to $26.66, while Rio Tinto fell $9.04, or 11%, to $70.00 after another steep slide on commodity prices overnight with the key Reuters/Jefferies CRB index slumping 4.1%.
