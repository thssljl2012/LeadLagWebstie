On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index futures contract was 181 points lower at 4,184 on a volume of 8,244 contracts.  Falls in commodities prices overnight lowered local resources stocks.

In the US, Wall Street plunged overnight after weak data reinforced fears of a recession in the US economy.

Also, US private firms cut 157,000 jobs in October, with more employees expected to lose work as the US economy contracts, the ADP Employers Services report said.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 486.01 points (5.05 per cent) to 9,139.27 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 98.48 points (5.53 per cent) to 1,681.64, snapping a six-session winning streak.
