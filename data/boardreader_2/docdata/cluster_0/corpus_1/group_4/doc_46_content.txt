THE share market has closed at a fresh four-year low today, with more than $34 billion wiped from the value of the ASX.  The ASX200 lost more than 3.5 per cent lower after falling heavily in afternoon trade, closing 129 points lower to 3523.  The All Ords lost 126 points to 3513, or 3.4 per cent, led down by resource and banking stocks.  Austock Securities senior client adviser Michael Heffernan said Macquarie Bank's interim profit announcement helped to momentarily buoy the market before it slipped into the red.  'It was a mixture of the big boys - the banks and the resources taking no prisoners again, (and) that weighed on the market.'  The market spent the day hovering around 1 per cent lower after a mixed lead from Wall St.  Investment bank Macquarie Group managed to buck the trend, gaining 16.5 per cent to close at $24.00, despite posting a profit decline in its half-year result.  Macquarie shares closed at a five-year-low of $20.60 yesterday.  'The fact that Macquarie maintained its dividend at $1.45 and cut employment costs by 40 per cent, even though profit was down compared to this time last year, that is very character building' Mr Heffernan said.  'That set the tone to the middle of the day, then we just wilted as we usually do.  The big miners were weaker, with BHP Billiton shedding 90 cents, or 3.59 per cent, to $24.20 and rival Rio Tinto losing $5.44, or 7.41 per cent, to $68.00.  The banking sector was mixed, with NAB adding 22 cents to $19.15, ANZ dropping 20 cents to $13.04, Commonwealth Bank falling $1.23 to $30.10 and Westpac dipping 77 cents to $15.55.  Brewer Lion Nathan dipped 35 cents to $8.30 and said its offer to buy Coca-Cola Amatil was 'compelling', as it looked forward to earnings growth this financial year despite the challenging economic environment. Coca-Cola Amatil shed 20 cents to $9.11.  Housing finance broker Mortgage Choice was steady at 80.5 cents after the company said profit in fiscal 2009 was likely to fall by as much as 45 per cent on the previous year, but in line with analysts' forecasts.  Austock Group dipped one cent to 18 cents after the company said its credit exposure to the financially troubled ABC Learning Centres was about $4.4 million.  The retailers were mixed, with Wesfarmers gaining 62 cents to $18.21, Harvey Norman adding three cents to $2.30, David Jones putting on four cents to $2.86 and Woolworths falling $1.65, or 5.91 per cent, to $26.25.
