NZ Dollar Gains as US Stocks Rally, May Resume Slide Nov. 24  The New Zealand dollar halted its downward slide, gaining after U.S. stocks rallied on the nomination of Timothy Geithner as President-elect Barack Obamas Treasury Secretary.   U.S. stocks rebounded on Friday after the nomination of Geithner, seen as a safe pair of hands to handle the economic crisis. The Standard &amp;amp; Poors 500 Index rose 6.3%, paring its weekly decline to 8.4%. In New Zealand, the central bank is poised to slash interest rates as much as 100 basis points next week to help alleviate the impact of what may be the worlds worst slump since the Great Depression. Further rate cuts are likely to extend the kiwis 29% decline in the past six months.      A rebound was always expected to come at some stage, said Khoon Goh, senior markets economist at ANZ National Bank. The long-term trend is still down. The New Zealand dollar rose to 53.84 U.S. cents from 53.19 cents on Friday, and increased to 51.11 yen from 50.63 yen. It fell against the Australian dollar to 84.98 cents from 85.21 cents on Friday.   Goh said the kiwi may trade between 53.25 U.S. cents and 54.50 cents today. ANZ National Bank predicts the New Zealand dollar will end the year in the mid 50s range against the U.S. dollar, though Goh said he doesnt rule out a fall below 50 U.S. cents.   Leaders of the 21-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group, which accounts for half of world output, called for improved corporate governance and backed efforts to thaw frozen credit markets at their summit in Peru. The leaders also promised not to erect new barriers to international trade.  In New Zealand, economic data out this week is expected to tell a story of woe, said Danica Hampton, currency strategist at Bank of New Zealand. Octobers annual trade deficit is forecast to widen to NZ$5.2 billion from NZ$5 billion and residential housing consents will tell of a struggling new housing market.
