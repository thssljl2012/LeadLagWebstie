HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Markets across Asian posted sharp losses Thursday, as stocks were swept away after Wall Street's sell-off and amid concern about rising deflation risks. Declines were led by Japan's Nikkei, which fell more 6%, with Sony Corp. under pressure in a glum session for electronics makers after data showed Japan's exports continue to decelerate. Tokyo's Nikkei (JP:1804610: news, chart, profile) ended 6.9% lower at 7,703.04, diving below the 8,000-point level for the first time since Oct. 29. Japanese exports declined 7.7% in October from a year earlier, their biggest drop in almost seven years, according to data released Thursday by the Finance Ministry. Japanese shares were also pressured after the U.S dollar weakened to 95.27 yen, compared with 95.85 yen in late Wednesday in New York and 96.75 yen there late Tuesday. Brokers said the sell-off in Tokyo was driven in part by a meltdown in the shares of nonlife insurers after an industry leader reported a drop in net income and a lower full-year outlook because of losses on equity holdings. Tokio Marine Holdings Inc.'s (JP:8766: news, chart, profile) shares ended 15% lower after the firm, Japan's biggest nonlife insurer, reported net income for the April to September fell 76% and cut its outlook for the current fiscal year to 43 billion yen from 150 billion yen earlier. Fellow nonlife insurer Sompo Japan Insurance (JP:8755: news, chart, profile) fell 14.7%. 'Clearly it's a dangerous time,' said Masafumi Yamamoto, a forex strategist with RBS in Tokyo. He added that further falls in equity markets could force these insurers to sell overseas funds and repatriate assets, leading to upward pressure on the yen, which could spur new rounds of selling. Australia's S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 ended 4.2% lower at 3,252.90, its lowest closing level since early 2004. The Hang Seng Index (HK:1804580: news, chart, profile) closed 4.3% lower at 12,264.34. South Korea's Kospi ended down 6.7% at 948.69, marking its eighth straight losing session. China's Shanghai Composite closed 1.7% down at 1,983.76. Analsyts said the regional downtrend remained intact as hedge funds were forced sellers of shares to meet investor redemptions. 'It's all about the October lows,' said Benjamin Collett, head of hedge fund sales trading at Daiwa Securities in Hong Kong. 'Investors are hoping we can hold on to the lows that were formed in October, or hold above there; if we don't, the outlook is very, very bad.' The declines follow a sell-off in Europe and U.S. stocks overnight. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($INDU:$INDUNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) fell 5.1% to 7,997, its lowest close in more than five years. The mood was grim after financial giant Citigroup (C:CNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) staged its biggest ever one-day percentage drop and fears about the fate of the Big Three U.S. automakers intensified. Andrew Orchard, an analyst with RBS, said stocks were also being pressured by mounting evidence of stagnant loan growth, noting that M2 money supply growth in Hong Kong fell to 1.8% in October, from 31.7% a year earlier. 'This reduction in credit creation is a sign of additional deflationary pressures that will be exerted eventually,' Orchard said in a note Thursday. New Zealand's NZSX-50 retreated 2.3%, Taiwan's Taiex was down 4.5%, and Singapore's Straits Times fell 3.8%. India's Sensex gave up 4.7%. Bangkok's SET was off 4%, Jakarta's Composite fell 3.7% and Kuala Lumpur's Composite fell 2.1%. Among advancers were telecom-equipment maker ZTE Corp (HK:763: news, chart, profile) . The Hong Kong-listed firm climbed 2.8% as investors bet it could benefit from new equipment spending by mainland wireless carriers as part of the likely 3G licensing at year-end. Comba Telecom (HK:2342: news, chart, profile) , another telecom-equipment provider, saw its Hong Kong-listed shares jump 7.4%. Makers of equipment used to produce semiconductors were lower as industry figures pointed to a 68% decline in October orders. Shares of Tokyo Electron (JP:8035: news, chart, profile) and Advantest Corp. (JP:6857: news, chart, profile) closed down 11.4% and 7.9% respectively. Chipmakers were lower after an industry association forecast global sales would fall 5.6% next year, marking the first decline since 2001. Hynix Semiconductor (HXSEY:HXSEYNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) shares were down 15%. Samsung Electronics Ltd. (SSNGY:SSNGYNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:  , , ) , the global leader in memory chip production, was down 3.3%. In Sydney, Rio Tinto (RTP:RTPNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) (AU:RIO: news, chart, profile) led the commodity sector lower, with its shares falling 13%, while Australia and New Zealand Bank (AU:ANZ: news, chart, profile) (ANZBY:ANZBYNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) retreated 5.9% Consumer-electronics firms such as Sony Corp. (SNE:SNENews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) (JP:6758: news, chart, profile) and Canon Inc. (CAJ:CAJNews, chart, profile, moreLast: Delayed quote dataAnalyst   Create alertInsider  Discuss  Financials Sponsored by:, , ) (JP:7751: news, chart, profile) were also under pressure from the combination of a stronger yen and data that showed that Asian consumers, who had held up fairly well while their U.S. counterparts curtailed spending, were beginning to cut back. Shares of Sony ended 6.4% lower and Canon fell 7%. Japan's trade deficit hit 63.9 billion yen ($667 million), as imports climbed 7.4% on month, according to preliminary Finance Ministry data.
