(Adds comments, details)  Mette Fraende  SYDNEY, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 2.5 percent to a four-year closing low on Monday, with investors disappointed by the efforts of G20 nations to stabilise markets and revive the world economy following a summit meeting at the weekend.  Merger activity, in the form of a $4.9 billion bid for soft drinks group Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd  from Lion Nathan Ltd , provided a bit of support, but not near enough to turn the market around, analysts said. 'It's down after a fall in the U.S. share market on Friday night and a slump in retail sales. That set our market up for a fall, and then there was disappointment regarding the outcome of the G20 meeting,' said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors. 'The ongoing capital raising, with various companies lining up to bolster their balance sheet ahead of the likely difficult trading conditions ahead, is also weighing on the market,' Oliver said. The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index  lost 95.1 points to 3,653.0, based on the latest available data, its weakest close since September 2004, though off an earlier low of 3,616.4. The market had fallen as much as 3.5 percent in thin morning trade.  New Zealand's benchmark NZX-50 index  closed down 0.9 percent at 2,741.9 points.  Shares in Coca-Cola Amatil rose 12.9 percent to A$9.31 after Lion Nathan, Australia's second-largest brewer, made a cash and scrip takeover bid, see: [nSYD350016].  Pulling the market in the opposite direction was ongoing concern over the banking sector.  National Australia Bank , the country's biggest lender, fell 4.4 percent to A$18.93, while the second biggest, Commonwealth Bank , lost 2.4 percent at A$31.33. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group traded down 3.9 percent at A$13.24. 'The market continues to worry about further writedowns and bad debt provisions, and they may be looking at a dilution of their dividend yield as well,' said Dominic Vaughan of CMC Markets.  Other financial shares were subdued, with shares in Macquarie Group , Australia's top investment bank, falling 9.4 percent to A$20.60 ahead of the group's first-half result on Tuesday. 'Their briefing day is on tomorrow so there is a bit of nervousness there,' said David Spry, of brokerage F.W. Holst.  Macquarie's smaller Australian rival, investment firm Babcock &amp;amp; Brown's  saw its shares fall 14.6 percent to A$0.41, after announcements that the group could face losses from its joint venture with GPT Group . Building materials maker James Hardie Industries NV's  shares fell 7.4 percent to A$4.40 after it posted a 26 percent drop in second-quarter operating profit in the face of a housing downturn in the United States [nSYU005531].
