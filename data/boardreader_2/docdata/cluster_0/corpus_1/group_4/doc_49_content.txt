(Adds banks, updates indices)  SYDNEY, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Australian shares fell 0.8 percent on Wednesday as the resumption of short selling in non-financial stocks triggered falls in companies such as Woolworths Ltd , which had outperformed in the recent sharp downturn.  The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index  was down 28.6 points at 3,494.6 by 0402 GMT. The index had risen as much as 1.4 percent in early trade.  New Zealand shares also fell, with the benchmark NZX-50 index  down 0.3 percent at 2,706.3.  STOCKS ON THE MOVE  * Australian banks bucked the downtrend with No. 1 lender, National Australia Bank  rising 3.9 percent to A$19.90, and third-largest, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group  up 5.5 percent at A$13.76.  Westpac Banking Corp  rose 2.6 percent to A$15.96, and Commonwealth Bank , the second largest, was up 0.3 percent A$30.20.  'We are seeing something of a readjustment in prices here today, mainly because of the fact that they have been sold off so heavily in recent weeks,' said Jamie Spiteri, senior dealer at Shaw Stockbroking.  Although the ban on short selling non-financial stocks was lifted, shorting financial stocks is still banned until Jan. 27, which may have been another supporting factor.  'It certainly could be a contributor,' Spiteri said.  0400 GMT  * Australian timber group Gunns  came off earlier lows after saying its proposed Bell Bay pulp mill project in the island state of Tasmania remained on track, dousing earlier speculation that it had collapsed.  Its shares were still down 12.4 percent at A$0.92, but recovered from a low of A$0.83.
