November 03  Close: The New Zealand dollar gained on Monday as firmer stock markets boosted risk appetite, ahead of expected interest rate cuts from central banks across the world.  The kiwi continued its steady climb away from last week's five-and-a-half year low of $0.5352, shrugging off data which showed wages grew at a record pace in the third quarter.  Wage pressure is now seen having peaked and, with the economy in recession, the data did nothing to alter expectations that the central bank will continue to cut interest rates.  'There's a sense of calm returning to markets and we're seeing some risk appetite re-emerging,' said Tim Kelleher, manager global markets at ASB Bank.  Over the weekend New Zealand followed other countries in offering to guarantee wholesale bank lending, while Wall Street shares gained as falling interbank lending rates boosted investor confidence.  At 0400 GMT the kiwi was at $0.5921/27 compared with $0.5868/74 in late local trade on Friday. It largely held in a range between $0.5840-$0.5900 before settling above $0.59 in late local trade.  Investors are now looking to a round of interest rate reviews this week, with cuts expected from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), the Bank of England and the European Central Bank this week.  ASB's Kelleher said the RBA rate review on Tuesday was the next main focus for kiwi dollar traders, with a Reuters poll picking a 50 basis point cut to 5.50 percent.  New Zealand bonds extended Friday's losses as demand for safe-haven government debt eased on firmer stock markets.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond, which moves inversely to prices, closed nine basis points higher at 6.13 percent.  Next Story: Short queue tipped for APN
