Australian shares fell sharply at the open today, threatening to erase all of November's early gains after investors ignored big interest rate cuts in Europe to send markets into steep falls overnight.  In early trade, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 share index sank 148.9 points, or 3.6%, to 4000.8 points.  Shares in BHP Billiton led the dive, falling as much as $2.54, or 8.7%, to $26.66, while Rio Tinto fell $9.04, or 11%, to $70.00 after another steep slide on commodity prices overnight with the key Reuters/Jefferies CRB index slumping 4.1%.  Shares in Fortescue fell 22 cents, or 8.1%, to $2.49.  The Australian dollar also retreated, trading recently at 66.45 US cents, down from yesterday's local close of 67.31 US cents. It was also buying 64.74 yen.  Banking shares also fell sharply. Commonwealth Bank shares fell 82 cents, or 2.1%, to $38.98, National Australia Bank dropped $1.70, or 6.9%, to $23.00, ANZ declined 50 cents, to 3%, to $16.45, while Westpac was down 51 cents, or 2.4%, to $20.49.  Macquarie Group shares lost $2.32, or 7.3%, to $29.48.  On Wall Street, markets were sharply lower for a second day as the post-election glow faded. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.9%, the broader S&amp;amp;P 500 was 5% lower and the Nasdaq Composite was 4.3% off.  European markets also plunged even with the Bank of England's shock 1.5 percentage point slashing of its key interest rate to just 3% - its lowest level since 1955 - and a 50 basis-point cut by the European Central Bank to 3.25%.  London's FTSE 100 share index lost 5.7%, Germany's DAX 6.8% and France's CAC 40 lost 6.4% overnight.  with AAP
