Australian stocks and the dollar have soared after dramatic moves at home and abroad over the weekend to shore up confidence in global markets.Bank stocks were among the biggest gainers today after $190 billion was erased from the Australian stock market last week.The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index jumped as much as 6.1%, or 241.6 points, to 4202.3 at the opening. In afternoon trading, the index was at 4100.3 points, a rise of 139.6 points, or 3.5% for the day, reclaiming less than half of Friday's 8.2% rout.The Australian dollar leapt, gaining more than 4%, or almost 3 US cents to 68.07 US cents before easing in early afternoon trading to 65.75 US cents. Against Japan's currency, it advanced 3.7 yen, or 5.7%, to buy 68.80 yen, and traded recently at 65.55.The rallies may be fleeting, however, given the historic levels of volatility jolting markets and on-going worries about how much economies will be hit by the financial turmoil, said research manager David Spry of F.W. Holst &amp;amp; Co.''The issues arising from the banking crisis are just not going to go away in the short term,' Mr Spry said. ''It's the aftershocks that are really hard to measure. No one really knows how this will transpire.'Prime Minister Kevin Rudd yesterday announced that all deposits in Australian financial institutions would be guaranteed for three years. The government also doubled to $8 billion the funds available to improve liquidity in financial markets.Mr Rudd said the guarantee is aimed at part in ensuring Australian banks would not be at a disadvantage if overseas rivals got government backing and capital injections, as is planned in Europe and elsewhere. European leaders overnight unveiled a combined effort to restore market confidence.Financials higherAlmost all sectors of the market were trading higher, with the financials leading the way, gaining about 7.8% overall until they eased in the afternoon.''The banks are definitely leading this market higher and it's all in reaction to the guarantee plans that have been announced by the federal government,'' EL&amp;amp;C Baillieu director Richard Morrow said.Banking stocks were favourites, with ANZ Bank up 7.6%, or $1.16, to $16.46 in afternoon trading.The Commonwealth Bank was up 4.3%, or $1.70, to $41.25, NAB was up 7.2%, or $1.50, to $22.30 and Westpac rose 6.7%, or $1.35, to $21.54.Among the smaller banks, St George was up 8.2%, or $2.06, to $27.25, Suncorp-Metway fell 4.5%, or 42 cents, to $8.85 after announcing that it was reconsidering the sale of assets. The shares had earlier traded 8.2% higher. Bank of Queensland was up 9.8%, or $1.08, to $12.08.Macquarie Groupjumped 7.4%, or $2.12, to $30.64 and Babcock &amp;amp; Brown was up 27.2%, or 27.5 cents, to $1.285.Economic signalsEconomic figures out today, though, underscore the fragility of domestic demand.Jobs advertised online and in newspapers fell 1.4% in September, for the fifth consecutive month, according to the ANZ Bank.'Heightened financial market volatility, falls in global equity and commodity prices, and uncertainty over the global economic outlook have intensified over the past month,' ANZ economist Warren Hogan said in a release.'ANZ has revised forecasts for unemployment in Australia and now expects the unemployment rate to rise to around 5.75% over the second half of 2009.'Official unemployment figures out last week showed the largest number of full-time job losses in more than two years, with the jobless rate rising to 4.3%.
