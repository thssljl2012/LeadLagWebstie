'Concern and uncertainty remain,' Mr Spiteri said. 'It's very hard to anticipate how long the repair job is going to take across financial markets at the moment.' Mr Spiteri said the local market was affected by outside influences and not any untoward domestic influence. 'The anticipation is now that we are going to have a slowing economy here in Australia, despite the fact that we are in a situation where we are a lot better balanced than most other major economies around the world. 'But at the same time, we are still just a small player in a global economy which is slowing significantly at the moment.'
