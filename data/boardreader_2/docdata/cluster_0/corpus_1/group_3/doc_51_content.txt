The Australian stock market rebounded to close almost two per cent higher after the Reserve Bank of Australia slashed the cash rate by 100 basis points, to six per cent.The move by the central bank was bigger than the 50 basis point fall economists had predicted and the first 100 basis point cut since May 6, 1992, when the RBA lowered the cash rate to 6.50 per cent.The news sparked major turnaround in the local market that opened more than three per cent lower today after stocks were savaged on Wall Street overnight.By the close, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was 78.3 points, or 1.72 per cent, higher at 4618.7, while the broader All Ordinaries picked up 53.2 points, or 1.17 per cent, to 4597.9.At 1.15pm on the Sydney Futures Exchange the December share price index contract was 108 points higher at 4674, on a volume of 49,058 contracts.The simple catalyst for the turnaround in the market was the Reserve Bank decision, Macquarie Equities client adviser David Halliday said.The market is hopeful that with some monetary policy easing and some fiscal stimulus by the government here and potentially a co-ordinated approach by similar agencies around the world might be enough to turn this dire situation around.I think the only thing one can be certain about in financial markets at the moment is to absolutely expect the unexpected.ANZ added 10 cents to $18.15, National Australia Bank gained 45 cents to $26 and Westpac picked up 77 cents to $23.27.Commonwealth Bank put on $1.15, or 2.61 per cent, to $45.15 and has begun exclusive negotiations with HBOS to buy its Australian retail banking arm BankWest.The Australian market opened over three per cent lower after significant falls on Wall Street overnight, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 369.88 points, or 3.58 per cent, to close at 9955.50.The major miners were stronger, with BHP Billiton gaining $1.91 cents, or 6.41 per cent, to $31.70 and rival Rio Tinto adding $3.29, or 3.89 per cent, to $87.77.
