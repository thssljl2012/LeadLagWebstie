LONDON (Dow Jones)--Nymex crude oil futures fell more than $2 to a new 13-month low in European trade Wednesday as fears over the impact of slowing economic growth on crude demand pressured prices.Nymex light, sweet crude dropped below $77 a barrel for the first time since Sept. 11 last year, on its way to an intra-day low of $76.05 a barrel, its cheapest since Sept. 10, 2007. ICE Brent dropped more than $2 to $71.93 a barrel, its lowest level since Sept. 3 last year.With the oil price bounce that followed a series of governmental banking sector relief packages deflating Tuesday, market participants were braced for further falls to come, with the outlook for global economies and associated oil consumption remaining bleak.'The honeymoon relief package reaction now appears to be giving way to uncertainty over its impact on global demand,' said Mark Pervan, senior commodity strategist at Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation in Melbourne.At 1120GMT, the front-month November Brent contract on London's ICE futures exchange was down $2.34 at $72.19 a barrel.The front-month November light, sweet, crude contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange was trading $2.43 lower at $76.20 a barrel.The ICE's gasoil contract for November delivery was down $26.75 at $717.50 a metric ton, while Nymex gasoline for November delivery was down 558 points at 182.90 cents a gallon.Source: Nick Heath; Dow Jones
