October 20 - OPEN: The New Zealand dollar was trading around US61.50c when the local market opened today, ahead of a week expected to confirm the highest inflation rate in 18 years and to include a hefty cut in official interest rates.Third quarter inflation figures are due out tomorrow and the median expectation of economists in a Reuters survey was for a rise of 1.5 percent in the three months to the end of September.That would take the annual rate to 5.1 per cent, the highest since the second quarter of 1990.At the same time, 11 of 16 surveyed economists expected the Reserve Bank to cut the official cash rate (OCR) by 100 basis points to 6.5 percent in Thursday's review.By 8am today, the NZ dollar was at US61.55c against the greenback, down from US61.81c at 5pm on Friday, while the kiwi was barely changed against the euro at 0.4589.The United States dollar rose against the euro, while the yen gained in volatile trading, as financial distress and economic weakness beyond the US persisted, giving the greenback a safe-haven bid.Weakness in the US stock market again supported the yen versus the US dollar, euro and other high-yielding currencies as investors unwound trades funded using the Japanese unit's low rates.The kiwi slipped against the Japanese currency, down to 62.43 yen at 8am today from 62.74 yen at 5pm on Friday.The NZ dollar was also down against its Australian counterpart at A88.28c by today's local open from A89.10c. The trade weighted index was 60.88 at 8am from 61.11.ANZ bank said that despite failing to solidly test resistance at US62.25c, the NZ dollar did remain above support at US60.54c.It expected the Reserve Bank's OCR decision to 'hold local markets transfixed' later this week.Against the aussie, futile attempts to move the kiwi higher were appropriately thwarted during Friday evening trading, ANZ said.The start of Australian inflationary data today should further add support to the Australian dollar side of the cross.- NZPANext Story: NZ market closes up 1.59 pc
