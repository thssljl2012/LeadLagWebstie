SYDNEY, Australia-Australia and New Zealand's share markets rocketed upward Tuesday following a record day on Wall Street that saw U.S. shares soar more than 11 percent.By noon, Australia's benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 closed up 154.5 points, or 3.7 percent, to 4,335.2, and the Australian dollar leaped to 71.06 U.S. cents, up more than four cents from its close Monday.The jump comes as Australia's government unveiled a 10.4 billion Australian dollar (US$7.4 billion) spending package intended to stimulate Australia's slowing economy.The government's decision to intervene was a catalyst for the Australian market's surge, Cameron Securities client adviser Adrian Leppinus said. 'We've seen phenomenal gains,' Leppinus said. 'There's been a mad rush for people to get back in.' The New Zealand share market broke a seven-day slide and closed up 166 points, or 5.99 percent, to 2,949. It was the benchmark NZX-50 index's biggest one-day gain since Oct. 29, 1997, its operator, New Zealand Exchange, said.New Zealand's surge follows the government's announcement Sunday of a 150 billion New Zealand dollar (US$92.5 billion) deposit guarantee scheme, meaning the savings of most New Zealanders are now government-backed.The big trading banks, ANZ National, BNZ, ASB and Westpac, joined TSB, SBS Bank and government-owned Kiwibank to confirm their commitment to the scheme, aimed at restoring confidence in the face of the global financial storm.
