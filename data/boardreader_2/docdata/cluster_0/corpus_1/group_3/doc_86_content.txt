There is renewed optimism on the New Zealand stock market. The NZX50 has surged more than six percent into positive territory in early trading this morning. It is currently 189 points higher at 2,972 and follows a resurgence in global markets after governments around the world pledged hundreds of billions of dollars to guarantee deposits and rescue failing banks. The major New Zealand trading banks all signaled their intentions to sign up to the Government's deposit guarantee scheme yesterday. Bank shares have leapt in early trading today. ANZ shot has up $3.22 to $21.50, while Westpac has gained $1.60 to $25.60.
