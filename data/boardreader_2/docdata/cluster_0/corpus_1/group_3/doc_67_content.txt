The Australian share market has taken a nosedive of over five per cent at the open of trade, entering what was expected to be an ugly day on the local market, following another big fall on Wall Street.Before the market opened Friday, shares listed in the All Ordinaries index had lost approximately $94 billion of their value so far this week.At 1015 AEDT, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 was down 225.5 points, or 5.22 per cent, to 4095.4, while the broader All Ordinaries had fallen 224.7 points, or 5.24 per cent, to 4066.6.On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December share price index futures contract had lost 179 points to 4121, on volume of 10,077 contracts.Macquarie Equities associate director Lucinda Chan said the market was a sea of red.'It is ghastly,' Ms Chan said.'We are down about five per cent but it is not too much of a surprise considering the US dropped about seven per cent overnight.'Investors are buying up gold.
