Gold prices have risen more than 1% today, edging up from Friday's deep dive as the US dollar eased against the euro following an agreement by European leaders on steps to rescue the banking sector.While prospects for an easing in the month-long financial crisis could dim investors interest in gold as a relative safe haven, it should also stem the kind of frenzied liquidiation that knocked nearly $US65 an ounce lower on Friday, the market's biggest one-day fall in dollar terms since 1980.Spot gold rose $US13.60, or 1.6%, to bid at $US861.00 against a notional close of $US847.40 on Friday, when prices were whipsawed in a nearly unprecedented $US100 range.The euro rose against the US dollar and the yen as European leaders agreed on steps to rescue the banking sector. The euro was 0.3% higher at $US1.3597. Against the yen, the euro was up 0.5% at 137.48.'Because we're seeing a bit of a bounce on currency markets, that's giving gold a lift,'' ANZ Bank research head Mark Pervan said.'But a rebound in the US dollar that would accompany a recovery in stocks would be bad for gold and we could see prices hit again,'' he said.Nations from Europe to Australia rushed out more plans on Sunday to shore up their banks with pledges to back lending, buy stakes in financial institutions and take other emergency steps, with markets initially responding positively.A rise in US stock futures on Sunday evening may be taken as a signal that markets are beginning to find some relief from a month of crisis, limiting gold's gains.S&amp;amp;P 500 futures rose 36.60 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures climbed 282 points.A rebound in oil also acted as a deterrent to gold sales, with US crude futures rising over $US3 to top $US80 a barrel.ReutersStory ToolsGot news tips for us?
