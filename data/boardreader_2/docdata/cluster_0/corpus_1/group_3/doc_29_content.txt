WELLINGTON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - New Zealand commodity prices had their biggest monthly fall in 21 years in September, driven by a fall in dairy prices, although a lower currency partly offset the decline, a survey from ANZ Bank showed on Thursday. ANZ's commodity price index fell 4.9 percent on the previous month, and was down 1.9 percent on a year ago. The bank said New Zealand's key commodities were being buffeted by the current global market turmoil and some, such as dairy products, were also coming off historically high levels. 'The way things have been evolving, it's almost week by week, and looking out for the next month or two we're expecting weak dairy prices and that will probably be reflected in some of the other commodities as well,' said ANZ economist Steve Edwards. Prices of dairy products, which account for about a quarter of New Zealand's export earnings, were down 7.9 percent, while aluminium was down 8.4 percent, beef fell 7.2 percent and there were smaller falls for wool, animal hides and wood products. Six of 13 commodities monitored fell, four gained and three were unchanged. In New Zealand dollar-adjusted terms, the index fell 0.9 percent, to be 3.6 percent higher than a year ago. The trade weighted NZ dollar index was down 1.8 percent on a month earlier, as the currency fell against most of its major trading partners except the Australian dollar .
