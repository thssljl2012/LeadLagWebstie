MELBOURNE, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Australian shares ended up 5.55 percent on Monday, ending a hair-raising three-day losing streak, after the government extended a blanket guarantee to all bank deposits and breathed some life back into battered bank stocks.The market, which suffered its heaviest one-day fall since the 1987 market crash on Friday, climbed as much as 6.1 percent as investors greeted the guarantee as a rare piece of good news amid gloomy talk of global recession and market meltdown.Australia's benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index  closed up 220 points at 4,180.7, according to the latest available data, led by the four major banks: Australia and New Zealand Banking Group , National Australia Bank , Commonwealth Bank of Australia  and Westpac Bank  (Reporting by Mark Bendeich, editing by James Regan)
