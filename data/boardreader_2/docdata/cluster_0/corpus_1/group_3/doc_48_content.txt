PM Australian shares fall sharply after overseas markets dived overnight, while worries about global economic growth sent the Aussie dollar to a four-year low against the greenback.The benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down as much as 3.3%, or 148.5 points, to 4391.9 in early trading. It is the lowest point since October 31, 2005.The Australian dollar traded at 72.18 US cents, after tumbling to as low as 69.85 US cents overnight, its weakest since September 2004, according to Bloomberg. It also plunged against the yen, dropping to as low as 70.32, its lowest since March 2003, before recovering some of the loss to trade recently around 73.60 yen.A sharply weaker Aussie dollar, though, is unlikely to deter the Reserve Bank from cutting interest rates by half a percentage point later today, to stimulate the economy amid a slump in domestic demand.The market is expecting the central bank's board to trim the interest rate to 6.5% from 7%, its largest rate cut since April 2001. The RBA's decision will be announced at 2.30pm.Broad retreatAll sectors in the sharemarket were down, with energy the hardest hit. The energy sub-index plunged as much as 6%, and the materials sub-index retreated 3.8%. The financials lost as much as 3.2%.ANZ Bank fell as much as 3%, or 55 cents, to $17.50, the Commonwealth Bank also lost 3%, or $1.32, to $42.68, NAB lost 3%, or 77 cents, to $24.78 and Westpac lost as much as 2.2%, or 50 cents, to $22.00.Investment bank Macquarie Group fell as much as 6%, or $2.10, to $32.90, while smaller rival Babcock &amp;amp; Brown lost as much as 18%, or 29 cents, to $1.32.In the resources sector, BHP Billiton was down as much as 3.3%, or 99 cents, to $28.80, while Rio Tinto lost as much as 3.5%, or $2.98, to $81.50. Fortescue Metals Group extended its recent rout, plunging 12%, or 51 cents, to $3.90.Woodside Petroleum shaved the most off the ASX200, losing as much as 8%, or $3.93, to $45.07, despite oil prices gaining for the first day in five. Santos was down as much as 6.2%, or $1.06, to $16.14.'Raw fear''What we're seeing now is irrational fear,' said Peter Strachan of StockAnalysis. 'It's raw fear.''Once people get over that, from the Australian point of view, things aren't that bad.'Not only does Australia boast four of the highest-rated banks in the world, even the plunging Australia dollar has kept commodities prices buoyant in local-currency terms, he said.'Certainly the falling Australian dollar will offset falls in Australian commodity prices,' said Lachlan Shaw, commodities strategist at CommSec.'Particularly for iron ore and coal price contracts which extend out to March 2009.'The effects of the plummeting Australian dollar depends on the company and their foreign exchange hedge book.'The exact timimg depends of the benefit depends on each company's circumstance.''But certainly a falling Australian dollar is good for exporters.'The price of nickel fell down US$900, to US$14,250 a tonne overnight. However, this morning in Australian dollars, it actually gained $304 to $19,880, Mr Strachan said.Copper, zinc and aluminum recorded the same disparity in price movements, falling in US dollars but gaining in Australian currency.'It's illogical to sell Australian metals stocks because at the end of the day, they have costs in Australian dollars.''You're paying wages in Australian dollars and getting paid in Australian dollars.'Gold miners were mixed, with Lihir up as much as 1.6%, or 4 cents, to $2.55, and Newcrest down as much as 7.3%, or $1.94, to $24.50.Race against timeOthers blamed the continued fallout from Wall Street.The US government's US$700 billion bailout package, passed over the weekend in Washington, won't provide immediate relief investors had hoped for, one analyst said.'The government package is going to be reasonably slow to be implement,' said David Spry, research manager with F.W. Holst &amp;amp; Co.'It's going to take time and the market doesn't have a lot of time,' he said. For banks, liquidity levels have not improved and will not for some time.'The banking crisis is now an economic problem.'All things considered, today's fall isn't a bad performance considering Wall Street's overnight plunge, Mr Spry said.The fear that's driving the market arises from the fact nothing has really changed in the market and uncertainty remains, he said.'Normally the falling dollar would be good but you've got to look at why it's falling,' Mr Spry said. 'Investors see Australia as potentially risky.'Even a short-term benefit from the Aussie's dollar's drop translates into a weaker outlook for commodities in 2009-2010, which doesn't bode well for the resource industry.Wall Street joined in a worldwide cascade of despair on Monday over the financial crisis, driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its biggest ever intraday loss.The catalyst for the selling was investors' growing despair that the credit crisis will take a heavy toll around the world, realising that the Bush Administration's $US700 billion rescue plan and steps taken by other governments won't work quickly to unfreeze credit markets.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 800 points during the session, slipping below the key psychological level of 10,000 for the first time since 2004.The blue-chip index closed down 369.88 points, or 3.58%, at 9955.5.The Nasdaq composite fell 4.34% and the S&amp;amp;P500 index lost 3.85%, halving early losses.The Dow Jones Euro STOXX 50 index of leading European companies plummeted a record 7.9% overnight, while Asian markets extended the rout today, with the Nikkei 225 index of top Japanese companies diving as much as 5.3% in early trading, dragging the gauge below the 10,000 point mark for the first time since late 2003.Shaw Stockbroking senior dealer Jamie Spiteri said the local market was weaker as a result.'Concern and uncertainty remain,'' Mr Spiteri said.'It's very hard to anticipate how long the repair job is going to take across financial markets at the moment.''Mr Spiteri said the local market was affected by outside influences and not any untoward domestic influence.'The anticipation is now that we are going to have a slowing economy here in Australia, despite the fact that we are in a situation where we are a lot better balanced than most other major economies around the world. ''But at the same time, we are still just a small player in a global economy which is slowing significantly at the moment.''Crude oil nosedived below $US90 overnight, with New York's main contract, light sweet crude for November, down $US6.07 to $US87.81 a barrel.The retailers were also down - Woolworths was off as much as 1.2%, or 33 cents, to $27.80, Wesfarmers was down as much as 2.9%, or 80 cents, to $26.50 and Harvey Norman lost as much as 4.6%, or 13 cents, to $2.68.The media sector was mixed.Consolidated Media Holdings lost 9 cents to $2.07 and Fairfax fell 12 cents, or 4.8%, to $2.38. News Corp added 40 cents, or 2.8%, to $14.69 and its non-voting stock gained 44 cents, or 3.14%, to $14.44.Qantas gained 4 cents to $3.04 and Virgin Blue was steady at 33 cents.The most traded stock by volume was Tanami Gold, with 35.54 million units changing hands worth $35,563.
