SYDNEY, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose 3.3 percent on Monday, easing from earlier highs as many non-bank shares slipped in cautious trade even after the government extended a blanket guarantee to all bank deposits. The market, which suffered its heaviest one-day fall since the 1987 market crash on Friday, had been up as much as 6.1 percent earlier in the session. Australia's benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index was up 131.8 points at 4,092.5 at 0238 GMT. Mirvac Group, Orica, Foster's Group , Boral Ltd, Woodside Petroleum and Lihir Gold were all lower. Australia's banking stocks were up but off morning peaks. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group rose 7.4 percent on the guarantee, National Australia Bank was up 7.1 percent and Commonwealth Bank of Australia firmed 4 percent. Top miner BHP Billiton stood 5.4 percent higher at A$29.25. New Zealand's benchmark NZX-50 index was up 0.8 percent at 2,826.29.
