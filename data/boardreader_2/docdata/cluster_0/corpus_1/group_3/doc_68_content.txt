Australian stocks are expected to open flat on Monday as Wall street closed the week modestly lower following its horror session on Thursday.AMP Investments chief economist Shane Oliver said the federal government's announcement that it would guarantee all money deposits for the next three years would have little impact on Monday's market. 'Whether it will help the local market is doubtful because our market is hostage to whatever is going on internationally,' Mr Oliver said. 'There isn't an issue with Australian banks anyway, but it is a positive thing and does provide additional comfort to depositors of Australian banks,' Mr Oliver said. The move was made as a key step towards safeguarding the nation from the impact of the global financial crisis.On Friday, The Dow Jones lost 128 points, or 1.49 per cent to 8451.19 while the Standard &amp;amp; Poor's 500 index fell 10.7 points, or 1.18 per cent, to 899.22.The tech-heavy Nasdaq managed a slim gain of 4.39 points or 0.27 per cent, to 1,649.51.Despite the Columbus Day public holiday in the US on Monday, the markets will remain open there.Commsec chief economist Craig James said the share market was not driven by fundamentals but rather by sentiment at the moment.
