SINGAPORE - Oil prices fell to $95 a barrel Tuesday in Asia after plummeting overnight as investors weighed the fallout from U.S. lawmakers' rejection of a proposed $700 billion bank bailout aimed at stabilizing the teetering U.S. economy.Light, sweet crude for November delivery was down 81 cents to $95.55 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange by midafternoon in Singapore.Oil prices plunged $10.52 to settle at $96.36 Monday amid worries that the financial crisis would drag on global growth and demand for oil. That was the second-largest drop in dollar terms and the biggest percentage-wise since 2001.In the last seven drays, crude has now fallen almost $25, or 20 percent. 'Yesterday's reaction was justified. There's a lot of anxiety in the market,' said Mark Pervan, senior commodity strategist with ANZ Bank in Melbourne. 'I think the market will now likely take a wait-and-see approach until a new emergency package emerges.' Investors were stunned by the U.S. House of Representatives' rejection Monday of the bank bailout plan. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrials plunged 777 points, the most ever for a single day. Officials scrambled to structure a new bailout proposal that would attract reluctant lawmakers and still soothe the unnerved financial markets. 'The general trend remains very negative,' Pervan said. 'Even with a new package, conditions remain weak for commodities.' Pervan said oil futures will likely fall to $80 a barrel over the next six months and may reach as low as $60.Investors are keeping a close eye on the dollar.
