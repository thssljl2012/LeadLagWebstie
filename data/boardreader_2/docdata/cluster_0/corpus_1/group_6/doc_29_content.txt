 Asian shares were mostly a little higher Thursday, helped by a bounce in financial shares, though Japan's Nikkei 225 faltered as exporter stocks were hurt by an ongoing rise in the yen. Korea's Kospi Composite was up 0.9% while Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 added 0.3% and New Zealand's NZX-50 gained 0.7%; the Nikkei was down 0.5%. 'FX worries are canceling out the encouragement from U.S. stock gains,' said Yukio Takahashi, a market analyst at Shinko Securities in Tokyo; Toyota Motor was down 1.8% while Honda Motor fell 3.1%. Overall volume for Asia was low and trade fairly cautious; 'the overnight gain in the U.S. markets seemed to be a technical rebound, and is likely to have limited positive impact on local stocks,' said Lee Jin-woo at Mirae Asset Securities in Korea. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 3.5%, recapturing roughly 85% of Tuesday's drop as a rebound in the financial sector ignited a broader rally. Nasdaq futures were now lending some support in Asia, rising 1%; Apple added 7.8% after-hours (though it was up 9.8% initially) as its fiscal first-quarter net income rose 1.9% on strong iPod sales, even as it predicted second-quarter results would miss Wall Street's expectations. EBay however dropped 5.8% in late trade as its fourth-quarter net income fell 31% on fading revenue and slumping margins; the online auctioneer issued a first-quarter view below analyst estimates. And Intel said it'd consolidate manufacturing in a bid to get its capacity in line with market conditions; the closures of five older facilities would affect 6% to 7% of its 83,900 employees.

Woodside Petroleum was down 1.4% after saying its underlying result for the second half of the year would be weighed by foreign exchange losses and impairment charges on U.S assets. Some chip-related stocks fell in Tokyo with the Intel news damping sentiment; Tokyo Electron fell 2.2% and Advantest 1.2%; Advantest was expected to post a consolidated operating loss of about Y15 billion for the nine months through December 2008, the Nikkei reported. Korean shares were crimped a bit by awful fourth quarter gross domestic product data, which showed the economy put in its worst performance in almost 11 years; GDP fell a seasonally adjusted 5.6% from the previous three months. Hyundai Motor was down 1.4% while Kia Motors fell 1.8%, with the auto duo set to report fourth quarter results Thursday; ratings agency Moody's Wednesday put Hyundai and Kia on review for a possible downgrade of their foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured bond ratings.

Debate was firing up again in markets on the yen and whether authorities in Tokyo were growing uneasy about its gains; Wednesday in New York, the yen.gained to a seven-year high against the euro and a 13.5-year high against the dollar after the expiration of a large options contract. 'It is around these levels last month when Japanese officials started warning about excessive yen strength, therefore we suspect politicians to begin addressing the issue and testing the market's resolve,' said CMC Markets strategist Ashraf Laidi. Japanese government bonds were falling with lead March futures down 0.16 at 139.49 points and the market awaiting the results of the Bank of Japan policy meeting; 'the focus is on whether the BOJ will step up further into unconventional monetary easing, such as buying corporate bonds or taking more risk assets as collateral in funding operations,' said Mitsubishi UFJ Securities strategist Naomi Hasegawa.
