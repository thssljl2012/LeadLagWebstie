SHANGHAI (XFN-ASIA) - China shares are expected to open flat after a lackluster performance on Wall Street with investors re-focusing on worries about the economy, dealers said.  Yesterday, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed down 45.83 points or 2.38 pct at 1,878.18 points, weighed down by banks on more share sales by strategic investors.  Bank of Communications (SHA 601328; HK 3328) will be closely watched after saying late yesterday that it received notice from 19 pct shareholder HSBC that the latter has no plan to reduce its stake and may even increase its holdings under appropriate conditions.  The statement came after news that an entity controlled by Hong Kong's Li Ka-shing sold 2 bln H-shares of Bank of China (BOC) (SHA 601988; HK 3988) and Bank of America cut its stake in China Construction Bank (SHA 601939; HK 0939) earlier this week.  The listed units of Aviation Industry Corp of China, such as Xi'an Aircraft International Corp (SZA 000768) may attract some attention after the group company signed agreements yesterday for credit lines totaling 176 bln yuan from 10 domestic banks.  Jiangling Motors (SZA 000550; SZB 200550) may be active after reporting a drop in vehicle production to 94,340 units from 95,285 a year earlier and sales rose to 95,171 units from 95,059 in 2007.
