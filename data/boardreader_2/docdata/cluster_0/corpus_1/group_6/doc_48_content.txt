On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index contract was 11 points lower at 3,505 on a volume of 27,016 contracts.  CMC Markets analyst David Taylor said the local market worked hard to push into positive territory at the close of trade.  'We were weak at the knees at the open following a very disappointing session on Wall Street overnight,' Mr Taylor said.  Mr Taylor said that with base metal prices down overnight the market did not get off to a good start.  'All in all a pretty weak session largely saved by some interest in a few defensive plays and good performances from our gold producers.'
