The Australian sharemarket perked up in afternoon trading yesterday but still closed almost 1 per cent weaker, largely on anxiety over the health of overseas banks.  The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index fell 33.8 points, or 0.97 per cent, to 3442.8, and the broader  Ordinaries index declined 30.2 points, or 0.88 per cent, to 3394.8.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index futures contract was down 34 points at 3428 on a volume of 31,490 contracts.  The market decline yesterday was also marked by an announcement from global miner BHP Billiton that it would cut production and slash thousands of jobs in response to weaker worldwide economic conditions.  CMC Markets analyst David Taylor said, ''The banking sector was hit pretty hard yesterday and today because of the run-off effects of what's happening in the UK.''  Investors already anxious about the state of US banks have been rattled by the Royal Bank of Scotland's forecast that its losses for 2008 could top $US41.3billion ($A61.64billion) the biggest yet for a British corporation.  Mr Taylor said Australian banks were more regulated and in better health than many foreign banks, yet there was nervousness in the market that Australian banks may feel some effect.  Among the major banks, National Australia Bank descended 78c to $17.61, Commonwealth Bank fell 74c to $25.61, ANZ fell 53c to $13.17, and Westpac lost 48c to close at $15.02.  In the resources sector, BHP Billiton dropped 29c to $28.66. Rival Rio Tinto fell 74c to $37.25.  Oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum was up 98c at $34.41, and Santos gained 21c to close at $14.21.  In the gold sector, Hillgrove Resources fell 0.5c to 11.5c, Newmont jumped 35c to $5.95, Newcrest surged $2.51 to $33.04, and Lihir rose 19c to $2.93.  The price of gold in Sydney was $US853 per fine ounce, up $US23.50 on Tuesday's close of $US829.50.  Fashion retailer Country Road was unchanged at $3.30 as it said controlling expenses and maintaining prices had helped profit growth.  Woolworths scraped off 1c to $25.79, and Wesfarmers, which owns Coles, was up 23c at $16.83.  Telco Telstra rose 6c to $3.60.  In the media sector, News Corp shed 30c to close at $12.31, and its non-voting stock fell 44c to $11.32. Consolidated Media lost 5.5c to end at $1.835, and Fairfax fell 9c to $1.39.  The top-traded stock by volume was Sydney Gas, with 117.58 million shares worth $49.97 million changing hands. Sydney Gas was steady at 42.5c.  National turnover was 1.09billion shares worth $3.46billion, with 555 stocks down, 309 up and 259 unchanged. On W Street, the euphoria surrounding the inauguration of Barack Obama as US President did not dispel the gloom surrounding the banking industry, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average index fell 332.13 points, or 4.01 per cent, to 7,949.09.
