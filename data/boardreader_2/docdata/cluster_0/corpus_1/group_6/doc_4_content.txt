TORONTO _ Stock markets were positive in early trading with investors relieved about plans from two of the biggest U.S. banks to strengthen their balance sheets.  Torontos S&amp;P/TSX composite index moved up 88.3 points to 8,967.9, lifted by financial stocks and energy companies as oil prices advanced, after rising 191 points.  The TSX Venture Exchange advanced 8.91 points to 853.21 while the Canadian dollar snapped a five-day losing streak rising 0.91 cent to 80.81 cents US. The loonie had fallen more than four cents on a stronger greenback and tumbling oil prices.  New Yorks Dow Jones industrial average gained 85.8 points to 8,298.3 following a rise of a dozen points.  Bank of America shares were off 12 cents to US$8.21 after the Bush administration reached an agreement to provide it with an additional US$20 billion worth of fresh capital to help it absorb losses at Merrill Lynch, which the company acquired Jan. 1.  And Citigroup says it is splitting up into two businesses.  One business, Citicorp, will do traditional banking, and the other, Citi Holdings, will hold the companys riskier assets.  The banks move reveals its growing focus on back-to-basics lending and deposit-gathering, and dismantles the 'financial supermarket' d a decade ago.  The move by Citi follows a deal earlier in the week to sell control of its brokerage business to Morgan Stanley as it looks to streamline operations and shed assets.  At the same time, both banks reported steep quarterly losses.  Escalating credit losses drove Bank of America to a loss of US$2.39 billion and the firm slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny.  Citigroup posted a fourth-quarter net loss of US$8.29 billion, or $1.72 per share.  Analysts expected a loss of $1.31 per share and its shares rose 16 cents to US$3.99.  The Nasdaq composite index moved up 15.29 points to 1,527.13 with investors also pleased with results at chip maker Intel Corp., even as the companys fourth-quarter profit plunged 90 per cent to US$234 million _ but the results still met subdued expectations. Sales slumped 23 per cent, in line with Intels previous guidance, as Intel was hurt by poor PC sales that have crimped demand for microprocessors.  The S&amp;P 500 index added 10.1 points to 853.85 as investors also took in tame inflation data from the U.S.  A record plunge in gasoline prices pushed overall consumer prices down for the third straight month in December, as consumer prices ped by 0.7 per cent.

The conglomerate will now commit $500 million to the fund, down from $1 billion on 'a temporary basis,' it said in a release.  New Flyer Industries Inc. (TSX:NFI.UN) units were off a penny to $8.87 after the Winnipeg-based manufacturer of heavy-duty transit buses said it ended 2008 with an order backlog of US$4.1 billion, up from $2.8 billion at the start of the year.
