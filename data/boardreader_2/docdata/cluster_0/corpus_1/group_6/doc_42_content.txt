THE share market surged 3 per cent yesterday as mining stocks responded to big gains in base metals prices and and a positive lead from Wall Street.  Market heavyweight BHP was up 6.9 per cent to $29.33. Its smaller rival, Rio Tinto, rose 10.9 per cent to $42.19.   The Big Four banks were also higher after strong gains by their European counterparts.   At the same time, the Australian dollar held its ground above US66c, as risk-appetite improved. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 rebounded as Japan, one of the few Asian markets to open yesterday, surged almost 5 per cent after the Government promised to help companies through the global financial crisis and widened a rescue plan beyond the banking sector.   The Australian benchmark index closed up 101.3 points, or 3 per cent, to 3444, after losing 12 per cent in the previous 12 trading sessions. The All Ordinaries ended up 92 points to 3392.3.   Volume was thin as markets in Hong Kong, South Korea, China, Singapore and Taiwan remained shut for the Chinese New Year holiday.   Macquarie Equities associate director Lucinda Chan said declines in the US dollar had boosted the price of metals, including gold, helping stocks of local resource companies. 'We're playing a bit of catch-up after the long weekend,' she said. Three-month copper rose 10.9 per cent to a high of $US3603.75 a tonne, compared with $US3251 at the close on Friday.   Newcrest surged 8.4 per cent to $33.15 after the spot price of gold in Sydney piled on 5.6 per cent to $US906.54 per fine ounce from Friday's close of $US858.15.   Lihir Gold rose a more modest 3.8 per cent to $3.03 after production at its namesake mine in Papua New Guinea was halted due to a local dispute.   Elsewhere in the mining sector, Murchison Metals rose 3.9 per cent to 52.5c, after Dow Jones Newswires reported that China's Sinosteel had been buying the iron ore miners shares on-market, and now had a stake of close to 4.5 per cent.   Australia's top four banks were higher after Barclays of Britain insisted it had adequate funding and would not be seeking a government bailout.   Barclays shares surged 73 per cent on the announcement, which boosted sentiment in the global financial sector and helped push European and US markets higher overnight.
