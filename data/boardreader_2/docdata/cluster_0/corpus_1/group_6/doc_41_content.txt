MAJOR banks drove shares higher today as expectations for another aggressive interest-rate cut next week intensified.  But big falls in Westfield Group, Wesfarmers, Rio Tinto and Boral restricted the markets advance. News that electronics retailer Strathfield had called in administrators also weighed on sentiment. The S&amp;P/ASX 200 rose 51.5 points, or 1.5 per cent, to 3495.5, taking gains over the past two days to 4.5 per cent and almost erasing last weeks losses. The All Ordinaries closed up 42.8 points to 3435.1 while the Australian dollar held above US66 cents.   The Big Four banks, which were savaged last week, surged 5.4 per cent after big gains by their US counterparts, while increased expectations for a deep interest-rate cut next Tuesday supported the sector.   Financial markets are pricing in a 95-basis-point cut in the official cash rate after consumer inflation had its biggest quarterly fall in 12 years, while some economists like Westpacs Bill Evans expect a 100bp cut.   Markets had priced in a 90bp cut before the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the CPI figures this morning.   The ABS survey showed that consumer prices fell for the first time in two years. It was the biggest quarterly fall since September, 1997, and frees the Reserve Bank to cut rates by up to 100 basis points next week.   The consumer price index declined by 0.3 per cent in the December quarter, after a rise of 1.2 per cent in the previous period, the ABS said today.   Westpac led the gains, rising 5.2 per cent to $15.59, Commonwealth Bank gained 6.4 per cent to $26.31, ANZ added 6.5 per cent to 13.21 and National Australia Bank increased 4.1 per cent to $18.02.   Supermarket giant Woolworths was also higher by 2.3 per cent to $$26.81 after first-half sales rose 8.8 per cent.   Lihir Gold rose 1.7 per cent to $3.08 after fourth-quarter gold production surged 26 per cent in the third quarter to a record 315,000 ounces.   One of the biggest drags on the market was Westfield, down 1 per cent to $11.98, after last night flagging a $3 billion asset writedown and a cut in dividend this year. The worlds biggest shopping-centre owner said the writedown would apply to properties across all regions, but the biggest drop in value would be in the US.   Brickmaker Boral plunged 15.4 per cent to $3.45 after cutting its full-year profit guidance by 40 per cent due to the worsening crisis in the US housing market.   Wesfarmers clawed back some ground to be lower by 2.3 per cent at $16.02 after selling $2 billion worth of shares at $15 apiece to repay debt.   In the resources sector, Rio Tinto plunged 2.9 per cent to $40.95 after saying it had not ruled out an equity-raising to repay $US10 billion ($15 billion) by the end of this year, while commodity prices weakened overnight.   There was growing speculation that Rio was planning to raise up to $6 billion through a rights issue.   Fat Prophets equity analyst Colin Whitehead said the capital raising would hurt Rios share price. It highlights that, perhaps, they should have engaged with BHP. They will have to raise it at a discount, so that will add to the pain of losing the takeover premium, said Mr Whitehead.   BHP Billiton finished higher by 1.8 per cent to $29.85.   The ABS survey showed that annual inflation rose 3.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, down from 5 per cent in the previous three-month period.   That was the slowest annual rate since December 2007, when inflation was last within the RBAs target range of 2-3 per cent.
