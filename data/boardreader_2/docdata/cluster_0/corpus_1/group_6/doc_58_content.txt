Chinese shares edged up 0.28 percent by midday Friday, off early highs as heavy selling in property shares offset gains among power producers triggered by hopes of a capital injection, dealers said.  Investors remained unsettled on news that Bank of America and the Li Ka Shing Foundation sold some of their holdings in major Chinese banks, traders said. 'Foreign investors' latest sale of Chinese banks triggered further concerns over capital outflows in other sectors, including the sagging property market,' Guosen Securities analyst Wang Junqing told Dow Jones Newswires.  But power producers outperformed amid hopes the sector will get further capital injections from the government, traders said.  Guangxi Guiguan Electric Power rose 4.1 percent to 6.86 yuan by midday after announcing it has received a 30-million-yuan (4.4-million-dollar) cash injection from Beijing for reconstruction after the deadly Sichuan earthquake.  The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index, which covers A and B shares, was up 5.34 points at 1,883.52.  The Shanghai A-share index rose 5.62 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,977.49, and the Shenzhen A-share index added 3.48 points, or 0.58 percent, to 605.80.  (Agencies)
