THE share market was deeper in the red at noon, dragged down by the resources sector, and impacted by local data showing a fall in new home building approvals.  At 12.00pm (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index was down 85.1 points, or 2.25 per cent, at 3694.6.  The broader All Ordinaries index lost 83.4 points, or 2.24 per cent, to 3644.8.  IG Markets head of dealing Oliver Stevens said the market was off to a bad start after the negative lead from Wall Street.  'We had that very bad lead from the US and we've just had out our own poor economic data - those building approvals look fairly disastrous,'' he said.  'Obviously worrying signs for the building industry.''  Australian building approvals fell 12.8 per cent to 9581 in November, down from 10,983 approvals in October, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said.  The data surprised forecasters, who expected building approvals to fall by just 1.5 per cent.  Mr Stevens said most sectors were in the red at noon.  'Oil was down - it had its biggest one day fall since 2001 - and the commodities were (down) as well.  'We had a good run on commodities over the last few days and we are reversing some of those gains.  'All sectors are down apart from the health care sector - that was the one that was down when everything was up over the last couple of days.''  The big miners fell.  BHP Billiton was down 5.67 per cent to $30.75 and Rio Tinto was 4.28 per cent lower at $44.92.  Energy stocks were also hurting.  Santos declined 49 cents to $14.72, Woodside Petroleum lost $2.17 to $36.60 and Oil Search sank 15 cents to $4.56.  The financial sector was in negative territory.  Westpac was down 27 cents at $16.60, NAB lost 13 cents to $20.76, Commonwealth Bank dropped 38 cents to $28.57 and ANZ sank 17 cents to $15.18.  Macquarie Group was down 5.45 per cent, at $31.91 after it warned of extremely challenging market conditions in the quarter ended December 31.  Bendigo and Adelaide Bank was down 2.85 per cent, at $10.57 after it said it had bought Macquarie's $1.5 billion margin lending portfolio for $52 million worth of convertible preference shares.  The major retailers were mixed.  Woolworths was one of the few bright sport on the market, up 25 cents at $25.87.  Coles owner Wesfarmers fell 60 cents to $18.87, department store David Jones sank 9 cents to $3.05 and Harvey Norman also lost 9 cents to $2.51.  Among gold stocks, Lihir sank 5.36 per cent to $2.47, Newmont dropped 7.68 per cent to $5.05, and Newcrest fell $1.44 to $28.25.  The price of gold in Sydney was $US842.40 per fine ounce, down $US17.35 on Wednesday's close of $US859.75.  In the media sector, News Corporation (the parent company of the publisher of news.com.au) was down 75 cents at $13.61.  Fairfax dropped 2 cents to $1.70 and Consolidated Media decreased 2.22 per cent to $1.98.  Also making news, Telstra says its financial guidance remains the same despite the telco's exclusion from the tender process for the National Broadband Network (NBN).  Telstra was down 6 cents, or 1.6 per cent, at $3.70.  On Wall Street overnight, US stocks fell sharply on bleak profit outlooks and stark jobs data showing the US shed almost 700,000 jobs in December.  The Dow Jones closed down by 2.72 per cent to 8769.70.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index contract was 101 points lower at 3674 on a volume of 9938 deals.
