THE share market closed more than 3 per cent weaker as the financial and resources sectors suffered heavy losses because of declining commodity prices.  At the 4.15pm (AEDT) close, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was 112.7 points, or 3.14 per cent, lower at 3476.6, while the broader All Ordinaries lost 106 points, or three per cent, to 3425.  Aequs Securities institutional dealer Ric Klusman said there were heavy falls across the board.  'Most of the damage is being felt in the banking sector,' he said.  Mr Klusman said the losses on the local market were due to falls on Wall Street and news that the UK government would take control of Royal Bank of Scotland after the bank forecast the biggest loss yet reported by a UK company.  He said rumours that Australian Securities and Investments Commission would not extend the ban on the short-selling of financial stocks, due to expire next week, had also affected the market.  'I think it's a combination of all those things, and people will be hoping for a bounce after the inauguration (of US president-elect Barack Obama) tonight.'  Financials were hurting by the end of the day.  Commonwealth Bank dropped 3.94 per cent to $26.35, ANZ fell 5.06 per cent to $13.70, Westpac sank 3.67 per cent to $15.50 and NAB decreased 5.4 per cent, to $18.39.  The resource sector was also in negative territory.  BHP Billiton dropped up 4.71 per cent to $28.95, while rival Rio Tinto shed 6.31 per cent to $37.99.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March share price index contract was 98 points lower at 3451, on a volume of 27,022 contracts.
