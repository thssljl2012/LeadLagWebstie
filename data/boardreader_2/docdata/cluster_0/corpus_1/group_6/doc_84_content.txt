Regional stocks fall. Photo: ReutersBleak economic data globally and a deepening banking crisis in the United States have sent regional stocks plunging. Shares in Bank of America Corp and Citigroup, two of America's largest banks, tumbled overnight as investors questioned whether the firms have enough capital to cover losses from toxic assets and a weak global economy. HSBC hit a seven-year low as analysts said it may halve its dividend and raise up to US$30 billion in a rights issue. In Hongkong, the Hang Seng Index closed 3.3 percent down, after earlier falling more than 5 percent. The Nikkei Index in Tokyo ended the day nearly nearly 5 percent lower, and Seoul lost 6 percent. 'The problems are global and there isn't any real good news around,' said Martin Angel, a dealer at Patersons Securities in Australia. 'You are just not going to escape it,' he added. Data yesterday showed US retail sales dropped a steep 2.7 percent in December, a bad signal for global exporters that have come to rely on the spending by US consumers. Indicators in the region also show signs of trouble, with a report today revealing core Japanese private-sector machinery orders fell a record 16.2 percent in November. A South Korean finance ministry official said growth could fall below the central bank's forecast of 2 percent.
