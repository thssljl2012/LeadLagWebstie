It was not a good start for the market today, with the financial sector opening down. 20/01/2009 Sky News  Market down 3.5pc at noon  BHP, Rio down heavily  THE stock market was down 3.4 per cent at noon after falls in European equities and declining commodity prices overnight dragged the local market lower.  At 12.05pm (AEDT), the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 was 124.9 points, or 3.48 per cent lower at 3464.4, while the broader All Ordinaries had lost 115.2 points, or 3.26 per cent to 3415.8.  CMC Markets senior dealer Dominic Vaughan said falling commodity prices and woes in the European financial markets, including a forecast annual loss of up to 28 billion ($60.29 billion) by Royal Bank of Scotland, had weighed heavily on the local bourse.  'We've been hit quite hard in all our main sectors. It is right across the board,'' Mr Vaughan said.  'The stresses on the European financial market have flowed through into our financials and we saw commodity prices fall overnight, which has also flowed through into our market.  'All in all, it looks like we may retest our lows at some stage.''  Resource stocks were deep in negative territory.
