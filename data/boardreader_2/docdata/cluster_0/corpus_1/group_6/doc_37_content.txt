(Adds fund managers' comments)  By Sonali Paul and Simone Giuliani  MELBOURNE, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Australian shares rose 1.5 percent on Wednesday, powered by banks, though top property stock Westfield Group  and building materials group Boral Ltd  slid on profit warnings.  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group  and Commonwealth Bank of Australia  topped gains among the banks, both rising more than 6 percent. ANZ closed at A$13.21, while CBA ended at A$26.31.  Fund managers said the pickup in the market in the last two sessions, and especially the stronger performance from banks, were a ray of light after recent falls in the market, but cautioned that there were still difficult times ahead. 'It's an encouraging start, but it's a road with many twists and turns,' said Tim Schroeders, a portfolio manager at Pengana Capital.  In one echo of that caution, the spreading global recession hit Westfield, the world's biggest shopping mall owner by market value, leading it to warn it would have to cut its dividend by up to 9 percent in calendar 2009 with earnings seen flat to slightly weaker. [ID:nSYD328244]  Its shares slid as much as 7.4 percent to a record low of A$11.20, but clawed their way back to close down 1 percent at A$11.98.  Meanwhile, a deepening U.S. housing slump and weaker Australian sales than expected forced Boral to cut its profit forecast by 40 percent for the year to June 2009, which sent its shares down as much as 20 percent and knocked its peers [ID:nSYD119464].  Boral ended down 15.4 percent at A$3.45, while James Hardie Industries , which gets around 80 percent of its earnings from the United States, slid 6.6 percent to A$3.81. CSR Ltd  fell 6.6 percent to A$1.425.  The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 index  rose 51.5 points to 3,494.5, based on the latest available data, after having fallen to a low of 3,417.1 earlier in the session.  New Zealand's benchmark NZX 50 index  gained 12 points to close at 2,747.9.  WOOLWORTHS GAINS  Top supermarkets group Woolworths Ltd  gave the market a lift, reaffirming its sales growth forecast after reporting an 8.1 percent rise in second quarter sales, sending its shares up 2.3 percent to A$26.81. [ID:nSYD150312] 'The fact that Woolies hit its expectations and seems to have done it pretty easily is very impressive,' said Craig Young, investment research analyst at Tyndall Investment Management. 'It will give people confidence that Woolies is still a good hiding spot.' On the downside, global miner Rio Tinto Ltd  limited the market's gains, falling 2.9 percent to A$40.95 after saying it was considering an equity raising among a range of options to help pay down $10 billion in debt this year.
