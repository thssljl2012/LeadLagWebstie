Article from:   The Australian  LOCAL shares led a rebound in Asian markets yesterday after bargain hunters swooped on stocks that had been oversold.  Miners and energy producers underpinned the recovery after copper rallied almost 4 per cent and crude oil snapped a six-day fall.  The S&amp;P/ASX 200 rose 32.4 points, or 0.89 per cent, to 3687 and the All Ordinaries rose 30.4 points at 3624.3.  Japan's Nikkei bounced 0.6 per cent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 1.4 per cent and South Korea's Kospi added 0.7 per cent late yesterday.  ABN AMRO head of sales trading Justin Gallagher said: 'A lot of the movements are due to share price moves over the past few days or investors still reacting to news that's been around for a week or so.'  Wesfarmers, which owns Coles, stole the spotlight after warning it may have to cut dividends while flagging up to $140 million in asset write-downs and provisions.  Wesfarmers made the announcement only after the ASX issued a 'please explain' over the sharp decline in its share price this month.  With little in the way of corporate announcements yesterday, the profit warning drew lots of attention.  Mr Gallagher said the news fuelled speculation that Wesfarmers would launch a capital raising before too long, which was likely to put further pressure on its share price.  Wesfarmers finished the day down 50c, or 2.9 per cent, at $16.99. Rival supermarket operator Woolworths rose 56c, or 2.1 per cent, to $26.92. David Jones fell 6c to $2.92.  In the energy sector, Santos rose 31c to $14.09, Oil Search fell 5c to $4.37, and Caltex rose 42c to $7.90 after it said its 2008 operating profit would be higher than previous guidance. Woodside Petroleum rose 88c, or 2.5 per cent, to $35.65 on the improvement in commodity prices.  BHP Billiton jumped 51c -- 1.7 per cent -- to $30.94. Rio Tinto lagged its peers, rising 26c, or 0.6 per cent, to $40.61, after suspending production at the Argyle diamond mine in Western Australia, axing staff and slowing a $US1.5 billion underground extension plan.  The move is part of Rio's plan to cut 14,000 workers around the globe and rein in $US5 billion of capital spending this year.  The spot price of gold closed Sydney trading at $US826.65 an ounce, up $US4 on Tuesday's $US822.65.  The gold miners were mixed, with Newmont adding 14c to $5.39, Newcrest losing $1.48 to $30 and Lihir giving up 2c to $2.66.  The banking sector was stronger, with ANZ picking up 48c to $15.33, National Australia Bank gaining 32c to $20.67, Commonwealth Bank adding 3c to $28.42 and Westpac rising 20c to $16.75.  Telstra lost 1c to $3.73 and will appeal against the Australian Competition Tribunal's overturning of a ruling to release the telco from some wholesale local service regulation in some metropolitan areas.  The media sector was stronger, with Consolidated Media Holdings up 2.5c to $1.98, News Corporation up 48c to $13.98, its non-voting shares rising 50c to $13.05 and Fairfax picking up 9c, or 5.8 per cent, to $1.65.  Bargain hunters targeted consumer discretionary stocks that have been sold down in recent weeks.  For example, Harvey Norman surged 5 per cent to $2.53, Tatts Group jumped 2.6 per cent to $2.77 and Aristocrat piled on 4.5 per cent to $3.71.  IM Medical was the most traded stock by volume, with 128 million shares changing hands, collectively worth $650,905. It rose 0.002c, or 66.67 per cent, to close at 0.005c.  Market turnover reached 1.1 billion, worth $2.6 billion, with 446 stocks up, 380 down and 259 unchanged.
