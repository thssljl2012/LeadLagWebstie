NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Thursday  as a plea for government cash by Bank of America and  fears about Citigroup's fate as it restructures fueled  concerns that fallout from the credit crisis is worsening.  Shares of Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank, were the  top drag on the Dow, with a drop of 21.5 percent to $8.01.  Shares of Citigroup plunged more than 18 percent to $3.69 a day  before the bank is expected to report its quarterly results and  a new strategic direction.  'There is no faith in Bank of America and Citi, they need  more money,' said Todd Leone, head of listed trading at Cowen &amp;  Co in New York.  'It is kind of more of the same as we had last year with  Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. I don't think they are going  out of business, they are both solid, but that is the  perception. The market wants to move higher, but financials are  definitely holding it down.'  The Dow Jones industrial average lost 163.12 points,  or 1.99 percent, to 8,037.02. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index fell 19.87 points, or 2.36 percent, to 822.75. The  Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 24.34 points, or 1.63  percent, to 1,465.30.  Investors feared a need for more government aid in the  financial sector pointed to mounting credit losses as the  year-long recession deepens. The S&amp;P financial index  fell more than 6 percent.  The slide put another dent in the market's push to recover  from its Nov. 21 bear market low. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 is now  up just 9 percent since that low after starting 2009 up more  than 20 percent.  Year-to-date, both the the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are down  more than 8 percent while the Nasdaq has lost 7 percent.  Citi shares have been on the defensive again since the bank  this week announced the sale of a controlling stake in its  Smith Barney retail brokerage business, a crown jewel, to  Morgan Stanley to replenish capital.  Bank of America shares touched their lowest level since  1991 earlier in the session.  In other developments, Moody's cut the rating on JPMorgan's senior and bank deposit debt ratings after the No. 2  U.S. bank posted a 76 percent slide in quarterly profit. The  stock was trading up 0.5 percent at $26.03.  On Nasdaq, shares of Apple Inc were the top drag  after the iPod and iPhone maker said Chief Executive Steve Jobs  is taking a leave of absence due to health issues. The stock  fell more than 5 percent to $80.91.  Economic news included a report by research firm RealtyTrac  showing U.S. foreclosure activity jumped 81 percent in 2008,  even though it slowed in the fourth quarter from the third.
