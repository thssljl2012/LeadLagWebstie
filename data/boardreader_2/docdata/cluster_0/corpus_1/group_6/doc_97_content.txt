   Asia Pacific stock markets tumbled yesterday, with Japan's benchmark index sliding almost 5 per cent, on gloomy United States holiday sales and renewed concerns about the banking industry.  Every market across Asia suffered steep declines, with broad-based selling hitting industries from energy to financials to exporters.  Sentiment was pummelled after a US Government report showed retail sales fell 2.7 per cent last month, more than double economists' predictions.  Meanwhile, a flood of negative news in the financial industry reignited worries that international banks would suffer ever-bigger losses and be forced to raise billions more in capital as the world economy deteriorates.  Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, reported a 4.8 billion loss for the fourth quarter, blaming 'exceptional market conditions'. Analysts said HSBC, Europe's largest bank, might have to raise US$20 billion to US$30 billion and slash its dividend.  In the US, reports surfaced that the Government was close to supplying Bank of America, the nation's biggest bank by assets, with billions of dollars more in aid after it agreed to acquire debt-ridden Merrill Lynch.  In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock average fell 415.14 points, or 4.9 per cent, to 8,023.31, with sentiment further hurt by new figures showing that Japanese machinery orders plunged in November.  In Australia, the ASX200 fell 4.27 per cent to 3529.5, its biggest fall of the year. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tanked 4.05 per cent during trading and South Korea's Kospi dived 4.8 per cent. - AP
