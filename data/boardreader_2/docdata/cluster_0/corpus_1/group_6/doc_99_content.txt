HONG KONG - Asian stock markets rebounded Friday from the previous day's rout, with Tokyo's index gaining nearly three per cent, as the U.S. bailed out Bank of America again and a weaker yen lifted exporters like Toyota Motor Corp. Major European markets opened higher.  After a tumultuous week that saw markets fall sharply, early trade in Asia was cautious but picked up later in the day as investors snapped up beaten down shares.  While still wary of more trouble ahead amid the global downturn, investors were cheered by signs the U.S. government would likely do whatever is necessary to prevent its economy from sinking deeper into recession.  'The market was overdone, extremely oversold, we're having a technical rebounds of sorts. However, the economic fundamentals are still poor,' said Alex Tang, head of research at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International in Hong Kong. 'Investors are hoping the stimulus will work, but it will take time. A U.S. recovery isn't going to materialize for some time.'  In Japan, the Nikkei 225 stock average added 206.84 points, or 2.6 per cent, to 8,230.15 as automakers and other exporters gained. Toyota, which said Thursday it was making further production cuts in North America, jumped six per cent, and Honda Motor Co. vaulted eight per cent. Electronics maker Nikon rose 6.7 per cent.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged higher 12.55 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 13,255.51 and in mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.8 per cent. Benchmarks in South Korea, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan and India also advanced.  As European trading opened, Britain's FTSE 100 rose 2.1 per cent, Germany's DAX added 2.6 per cent and France's CAC-40 was 2.7 per cent higher. U.S. stock futures advanced, pointing to a stronger open on Wall Street. Dow futures rose 118 points, or 1.5 per cent, to 8,280 and S&amp;P500 futures climbed 13.30 points, or 1.6 per cent, to 852.60.  Early Friday in the U.S., Bank of America and the Treasury Department reached an agreement for an additional US$20 billion in fresh capital from the federal government's emergency rescue fund, plus guarantees against losses on up to $118 billion in troubled assets. The bank was to use the aid to help it absorb losses from its acquisition of faltering investment bank Merrill Lynch.  The deal came just hours after American legislators authorized a second $350 billion from the government's bailout fund amid mounting speculation that debt-laden banks would need even more rescue money. Meanwhile, allies of President-elect Barack Obama unveiled an $825 billion recovery bill - two-thirds spending and one-third tax cuts - to help jump-start the world's largest economy.  In Hong Kong, Chinese banks received a boost from news the country's sovereign wealth fund has been buying shares in the companies. Leading lender Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China Ltd, or ICBC, rose 3.6 per cent, while Bank of China added 4.6 per cent.  Among Friday's top gainers were Asian tech stocks after heavyweight American chipmaker Intel Corp. suggested margins might improve in the second half this year, even as it reported a 90 per cent plunge in fourth quarter profit.  Asian markets initially found support from Wall Street, where markets staged a turnaround to close higher. The Dow rose 12.35, or 0.2 per cent, to 8,212.49 after falling the past six days.  Broader stock indicators also advanced, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index up 1.12, or 0.1 per cent, to 843.74 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index gaining 22.20, or 1.5 per cent, to 1,511.84.  Oil prices fluctuated throughout the day in Asia, with light, sweet crude for February delivery down 15 cents at $35.25 a barrel late in the session. Overnight, the contract fell five per cent, or $1.88, to settle at $35.40, swooning as low as $33.20 during the session to a near five-year low.  Content Provided By Canadian Press.
