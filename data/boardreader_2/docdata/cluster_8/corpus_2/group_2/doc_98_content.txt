 Hi,    I would like to share my experience of opening a bank account with Barclays. It proved to be a piece of cake in my case. I had got my national Insurance (NI) number immediately after reaching UK (Thanks to my friend for timely advice to get the NI number). I got the job and took a letter from my employer to show to the bank that I have been employed and needs a bank account in which my salary would be transferred by the company.         I went to Barclays branch near my office. The lady over there was so kind. She asked me if I had a proof of my residence (utility bills on my name). I told her I arrived here recently and didnt have such proof however I do have NI number issued on my name. She took my passport, my NI number letter and my passport. She interviewed me for half an hour and gathered all the details required to open the bank account including the type of account I would like. Finally, she gave me a confirmation letter printout with my account number on it and said I could transfer money to the account now. The debt card/check book would be ready in arnd five days and would be delivered on the address mentioned on my NI number. Whereas, I could apply for the credit card after three months.         I really liked the experience and how it all went very well. Kudos to Barclays and my friend who advised me in time to get the NI number.    Cheers
