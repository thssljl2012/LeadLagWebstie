  Hi I know this is an old thread but I wondered if Adams 30 was online and if he could update about his barclays electron/connect card.  I will be so .......&amp;#039;ed off if I&amp;#039;ve been given the wrong one, because of the complete shambles which I had to endure to get it.  Firstly rang the number I use to pay my barclay card (I&amp;#039;m with barclays) and ask if I can open an electron account - yes you can but you&amp;#039;ll have to go into a branch.  Monday morning try to find out tel number of local barclays branch so have to speak to call centre on 0845 number.  No barclays branches don&amp;#039;t have tel numbers and why do you need to ring them anyway.  Because I want an electron card.  Cetrainly madam I can organise that over the phone and sorry you have been given wrong information I&amp;#039;ll transfer you to relevant department.  Wait 20 minutes on hold then get through - no we can&amp;#039;t do that over the phone you&amp;#039;ll have to go to a branch - oh I asked that question 20 minutes ago.  while you&amp;#039;re on can we interest you ion any loans .....no ..... we notice you have xxxxxx in your account can we interest you in a savings account ... no.  so I spend 2 lunchtimes in branch attempting to open an electron account - why do you want one you&amp;#039;ve already got a connect platinum - because I do - you&amp;#039;ll have to come back tomorrow.. Card arrives yesterday looks exactly the same as my first connect card - bright blue and it says connect on it so I ring Barclays where I started off a week previous and he says it&amp;#039;s an connect electronic card so i transfer 100 into that account.  Now it seems I haven&amp;#039;t got an electron card at all.  Please tell me what happened to you when you enquired.
