 The sorry truth is that insurance companies like AIG are reluctant to pay the claims of ordinary people in situations like yours.  Their insurance policies always exclude the events that really happen to ordinary people -- except those events of course that don&amp;#039;t entail much loss.    The money going to AIG will go into the pockets of the big corporations who sponsored the whole calamity in the first place -- and people like your neighbors with legitimate claims will have to wait years for their claims to be handled -- and may never actually receive compensation.    And then of course there is the terrible irony that many people whose tax money will be used to bail out AIG can&amp;#039;t even afford their own insurance -- not even health insurance.  This is immoral.  And don&amp;#039;t tell me this is a loan.  We will never see the money being handed over to AIG as it is today.  Even if they pay it back, by the time they do, inflation will have eaten away at a lot of its value.  There goes our future.  Bye.  Bye.    These rescues just delay the tragedy.  They cannot prevent it.
