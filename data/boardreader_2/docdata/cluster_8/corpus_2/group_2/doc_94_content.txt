  In conjunction with the introduction of Personal Reserve, Barclays seem to be reducing overdraft limits - presumably to make it more likely that they can harvest those profit-making account charges.     I&amp;#039;ve had an overdraft limit of 3700 for years. For the last three years, I&amp;#039;ve rarely gone overdrawn, although I have to say I use the overdraft in preference to my credit cards for major purchases (ie ones I&amp;#039;m not going to pay off straight away) as my overdraft APR is only 9.9%, my lowest credit card being 16.9%.     Suddenly I get a letter from Barclays this week saying my overdraft limit is being reduced by 50% to 1850   I&amp;#039;m guessing the next letter will give me a personal reserve of 150 to top up to 2000....     They seem to be doing the same with Barclaycard as well...At the same time as my main credit provider (John Lewis) increases my limit, Barclaycard have reduced them. My Mastercard limit hasn&amp;#039;t been touched YET, but my Visa card has now been reduced to a &amp;#039;really useful&amp;#039; 300   I don&amp;#039;t even plant to use my Barclaycards except in emergency due to them having high APRs.     My finances are in a better state thean they have been EVER in my life - the only money I owe is my mortgage (incuding car loan as further borrowing at mortgage APR over four years - cheapest way to do it and funded by my employer anyway) yet my creditworthiness seems to be dropping!!     Maybe I&amp;#039;m not borrowing ENOUGH to keep them happy?
