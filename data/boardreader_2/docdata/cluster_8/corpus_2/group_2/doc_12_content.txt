Actually new and second hand car insurance got price difference or not (per annum coverage)?  I afraid to use the AIG leh got any other kind of insurance company to choose?  Last time I ask one sales agent, he told me my age around (25-30) and new on the road.  The insurance per annum is quite high, around SGD2.5k.  Is that true?
