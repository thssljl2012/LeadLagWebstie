  Hi, I went BR 2nd June and went straight to Barclays and opened an account, I get a cash card only but have set all my direct debits up without any problems.     New account was opened 20th June and direct debits set up by 1st August.     Hope thats some help!  oh, I informed Barclays why I needed the account and as it has no credit   facilities - i.e no switch card / overdraft - was not a problem.     Hope thats some help!
