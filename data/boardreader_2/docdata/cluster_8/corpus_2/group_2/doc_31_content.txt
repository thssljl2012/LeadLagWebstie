Probably the one thing that annoys me about Bush is his willingness to buy out companies.         Insuring mortgage markets is a bad idea.  That is like insuring stocks!  If AIG collapses, then all of the other insurance companies are going to get the business and expand, and their expansions are going to create new jobs for people to have.      Or, AIG could just wash their hand clean of this mess by admitting that they made a bad move, and then refusing to pay.  That way, the least amount of people lose, and the others who have life insurance and car insurance would be able to keep having insurance.  This is assuming that they haven&amp;#039;t it all yet.         But no, we are afraid of change and losing all of the companies that we love, so we have the taxpayers pay the cost.  Give the company a buy out, and hope that other companies don&amp;#039;t keep messing up.
