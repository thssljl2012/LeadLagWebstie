  My wife used a Barclays cashpoint to withdraw 200 from her Abbey account to pay our plasterer.  The cashpoint displayed a message saying &amp;amp;quot;this action cannot be processed, please contact your bank&amp;amp;quot;  At this point she phoned Abbey from her mobile who told her they cannot see any cashpoint transactions for 24hrs, call tomorrow.     She then went up the road to a Abbey cashpoint and withdrew 200 ok.     When she checked her internet banking a couple of days later it showed 2 withdrawls of 200.        She phoned Abbey and lodged a complaint.  A few days later Abbey responed saying they had seen evidence from Barclays showing 200 had sucessfully been withdrawn.  She wrote back to Abbey asking for it to be invetigated further, but they wrote back saying more-or-less the same thing.     Is there anything else that we can do, or do we just have to write the money off.     Thank you.
