 Just had a phone call from someone claiming to be Barclays Bank wanting me to give them personal details regarding my application!    After confirming my DOB and Post Code I refused to give out any other details unless they could prove to me they were Barclays Bank!  They refused.    I was told that my application had missing or incorrect details, funny because all the details I gave them were correct and I confirmed this at the Branch.  They are now going to post me the forms and have told me it could take upto 6 weeks from when they receive them!!!      An absolute disgrace!  I will be making my second complaint right now!
