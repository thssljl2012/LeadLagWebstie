  Just wondered if anybody has experienced what my Husband and I have with Barclays or can offer any advice as to what we need to do next?     We have always been refused an overdraft facility with Barclays so were a little surprised when in March of this year we were given an unauthorised overdraft for up to a 1000.00, we had a couple of letters from Barclays telling us at certain stages through the months of March til July that we were so much overdrawn here and so much overdrawn there and quited clearly stating on these letters were the words &amp;amp;quot;whilst this does not give Barclays any concern&amp;amp;quot;, we spoke to Barclays on a regular basis and again were told that as my Husband and I were good valued customers, Barclays are doing it as a gesture of goodwill to save any Direct Debits been returned etc etc.  Then in August of this year (whilst we were on holiday in Wales) they put a very abrupt end to this,we couldn&amp;#039;t even draw any money out even though my Husbands wages had been paid in!  To cut a very long story short we complained to Barclays (back in August) we eventually recieved a reply from them today-still not telling us why this was put on our account but informing us that during this period they charged us 750.00 in bank charges! with no offer of them returning said charges or even part of them.     We are at our wits end with Barclays!!!!!!!!!! Any body else had similar problems?
