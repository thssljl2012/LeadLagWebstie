I don&amp;#039;t like the Government getting involved in actual business transactions. Other than the Postal Service and the Mint, they usually operate at a loss. But, in this situation, the Government &amp;#039;take-over&amp;#039; of AIG may be necessary. This is certainly not a &amp;#039;bail-out&amp;#039;. The government will own 80% of AIG, it is a &amp;#039;take-over&amp;#039;. AIG&amp;#039;s insurance division is a proven moneymaker over the years. The real question is weather the government will be able to continue that trend while correcting AIG&amp;#039;s poor lending practices. Personally, I think the government would have a hard time running a lemonade stand, let alone a large diversified business.  I believe this to rank up there in importance with (FDR off the gold standard or FDR&amp;#039;s New Deal or the crash of 1929). This could set a presidence that could lead to disaster. If it is OK for the government to buy out a company and go into the insurance and brokering business, will it be all right for them to go into other businesses? Remember the &amp;#039;bail-out&amp;#039; of Chrysler, it was a loan.....this is something completely different. This is a form of Communism (some like to call it Socialism). It could lead to the type of Semi-Socialism that France, Great Britain and Canada practice. The next step could be the Government buying out Health Care companies, Mass Transit co&amp;#039;s, Energy co&amp;#039;s etc. I believe that both McCain and Obama should drop everything and show leadership in addressing this issue, it is that important.
