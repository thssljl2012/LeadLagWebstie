Phoned them and they do not have a reason why this happened and as such as complaint has now been registered.     They are bl...dy USELESS.                      UPDATE, UPDATE, UPDATE.     Well I received a goodwill payment of 220.00 for the error caused by Barclays. I declined to accept it and have now received an offer of 300.00.  Considering the money has been invested with another financial institution for the last 6 months and earning good interest I will now not take the matter any further.
