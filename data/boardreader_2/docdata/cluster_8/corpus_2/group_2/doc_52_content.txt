       Hi BP,  I agree that you weren&amp;#039;t insinuating Obama is &amp;#039;communist&amp;#039; in his leanings, but don&amp;#039;t you find the AIG debacle interesting?    It looks like the Government is now in the insurance business, lol.   Mortgage insurance with Fannie and Fred takeovers and now life insurance with AIG.  Too much irony for me as I&amp;#039;m one who WOULD like the govt. to go in the health insurance business by adopting a single-payer plan.  Things just get curiouser and curiouser.
