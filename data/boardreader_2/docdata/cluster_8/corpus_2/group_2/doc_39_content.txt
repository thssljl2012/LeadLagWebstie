    Auntie Christ:      abeewon:       Auntie Christ:  The government bailed out AIG you guys know what that means right anyone that pays taxes are basically business partners in a  hot mess of an insurance company          what kills me is , if i run my little business into the ground the government isnt bailing my ass out. my business is worth 2mill.AIG was 85 billion.  it&amp;#039;s ridicules they just said they were not going to bail anyone else out but I guess they called do overs or something   So dose the government now handle insurance claims for AIG..............lol @ the folks that have AIG car insurance that&amp;#039;s going to blow    Thats because the government=insurance companies, banks, old cartels and old money in general.
