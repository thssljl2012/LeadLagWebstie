I maintain an account with Barclays. This comes with a debit/cash card that I use rarely in Canada, often when I go to the US (it works better than my Scotiabank card) and lots when I go to the UK. While doing a bit of online banking, I noticed a warning on the Barclays website about using cards overseas. It appears that you have to let them know in advance or the card won&amp;#039;t work. I think this must be quite new because I used my card in Wyoming a few months back.      I raised the issue with some scouser just now, while making a transfer. He told me that, because Barclays know I am in Canada, my card will work fine here. If I go to the US, which I&amp;#039;m doing in a couple of weeks, I will have to let them know beforehand. Most bizzarely, I will also have to let them know if I&amp;#039;m going to the UK.      Other banks are probably doing the same.                        Scotia bank do the same for Interac
