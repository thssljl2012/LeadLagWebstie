AIG really for selling ***** loan insurance to banks. What they did is the equivalent of me starting a medical insurance company then collect insurance and assume nothing bad will happen to anyone. The problem is if AIG goes out of busce  millions of people will be with out insurance. But lucky for us AIG is now a part of the government so everything is ok.......sigh
