The short version:      So when times were good (i.e. after the economy got over Sept. 11), banks were issuing mortgages to people beyond their value.        Let&amp;#039;s say you loaned two friends $100 each on Monday.  Bob is a deadbeat, but says he will get a job by Friday.  Dan is not a deadbeat.  But on Wednesday, you get the word that Bob did not get the job.  So you want your money back, right?  And while you&amp;#039;re at it, since the economy sucks, Dan might lose his job, so you ask him for the money too.  Dan gets screwed because you got scared and has to come up with the $100.  You might just have to accept that Bob will never pay you your money back.  So what, you could now be out $200.      Now just multiply this by billions, and you get an idea of how all of a sudden people&amp;#039;s homes got foreclosed.      So there were all these loans/mortgages given to people who couldn&amp;#039;t pay them back.  That&amp;#039;s how you make money &amp;amp;quot;disappear.&amp;amp;quot;  Because even if they foreclose and take your house, guess what - that&amp;#039;s a big chunk of property you have that now you have to what - sell?  Banks don&amp;#039;t sell houses.  So they are now left with stuff they can&amp;#039;t sell.  The value vanishes.      At the same time, we had all sorts of crap going on.  High price of oil/gas.  A shrinking economy.  People now too scared to spend money.  So this all of a sudden caused people to rethink what had been going on, the whole &amp;amp;quot;we did what?!&amp;amp;quot; mentality.  Of course, it stirred a panic.      Now, AIG does one thing - insurance.  No matter what their business is, it&amp;#039;s always to more or less cover your ass in case something goes wrong.  They got creative, basically insuring people&amp;#039;s investments.  So if you invested $100 and the company you invested in went bankrupt (i.e. kiss your money goodbye), AIG would at least give you a $20.  Not accurate, but you get the idea.      Multiply by the billions.      That&amp;#039;s how AIG screwed itself.  As more investments (and the banks that made them) go bust, AIG has to pay out more money.      So if you don&amp;#039;t save AIG, you suddenly make all this money really disappear.      Awesome, right?
