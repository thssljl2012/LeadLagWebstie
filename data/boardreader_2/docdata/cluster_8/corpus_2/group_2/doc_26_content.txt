                     Re: What To Do About Insurance?                                       your post is a bit confusing. was your car a salvage title car before you bought it? when an insurance company totals out a car, it&amp;#039;s because the cost of fixing it is more than the worth of the car. if they totaled it out, it should affect registering the car, but i don&amp;#039;t know about insuring it. if you got it fixed, tell your insurance company that it&amp;#039;s been repaired and they should send someone to inspect the car prior to insuring it. i just purchased insurance for a family car that was totalled a couple years back. i had no problems adding it to my insurance. i have AIG Direct. if the insurance company refused to insure a salvaged title car, i would find another company.                                    __________________
