  Thanks for your reply.    I have read a few postings on here about recent cloning of card &amp;amp;quot;chips&amp;amp;quot; and whether the matter should be reported to the police.    My friends tell me when they initially visited Barclays they were told not to go the Police. However when they visited Barclays most recently they were told they should have reported the matter to the Police. Could it be Barclays have used this as part of their judgement and should this form part of the compliant.
