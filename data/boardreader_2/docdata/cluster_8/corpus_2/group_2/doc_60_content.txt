That will teach &amp;#039;em. - Og                      That sounds good in theory, but what happens when you need a doctor?  Medicine? Have a car wreck?  You&amp;#039;ve paid your premiums, but your insurance company is out of business. The government is not going to let an insurance company or a bank fail.  Always in the past, other insurance companies have stepped in and &amp;amp;quot;bought&amp;amp;quot; the failing company.  AIG is too big for a purchase, so to keep from having infrstructure failure, they are making a &amp;amp;quot;loan&amp;amp;quot;.  It is painful and it is caused by mismanagement, but really, there is no other option if you want the country to not panic.
