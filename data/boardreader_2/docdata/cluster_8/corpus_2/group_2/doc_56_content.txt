Well AIG is like the modern BCCI, an international criminal   nexus of cutout companies and misdeeds:             So, what you&amp;#039;re showing here is that AIG- not a bank, but an Insurance Company, is like a giant spider- and if it goes down, all sorts of other businesses that it owns will go down too, right? I assume, since you call it &amp;amp;quot;criminal&amp;amp;quot;, you are anti-bailout. I&amp;#039;m wavering. Not bailing them out will cause chaos, but I personally feel that someone needs to help or recompense the average person. With AIG, unlike the banks, you can&amp;#039;t really blame people... they weren&amp;#039;t  living above their means , they were just buying insurance.                 &amp;amp;nbsp;          &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;nbsp;
