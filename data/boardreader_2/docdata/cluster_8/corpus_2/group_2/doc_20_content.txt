         Hi All,  Have just read this about AIG, who I have my car insurance with:   http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7617066.stm   If they do go under, what happens to my policy?  And if I need to make a claim, what happens then?  I&amp;#039;m not panicking about it, it just made me think what if?  TIA  Ronnie
