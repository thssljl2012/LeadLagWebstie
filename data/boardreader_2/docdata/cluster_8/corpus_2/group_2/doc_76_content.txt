I&amp;#039;m not a Barclays customer, hell, I don&amp;#039;t like Barclays, but I genuinely don&amp;#039;t see an issue with the Personal Reserve.                      I see a problem with it.... It&amp;#039;s apply for and giving customers an overdraft that they don&amp;#039;t want and haven&amp;#039;t applied for with very high interest rates. so people who aren&amp;#039;t money savy will end up using it instead of applying for a normal overdraft or more money. basically trying to get people into debt and make money off it. I&amp;#039;ve also been with them since I was 16 and on my 18th birthday i was offered 300 overdraft and 1600 credit card from barclays. then when i used some of this credit they automatically increased the credit card to 2600 and increased my overdraft to 800 when i was unsure and didnt agree in the bank.     that&amp;#039;s the problem. they make money from people in debt  my personal reserve is 500 and i never received a letter.
