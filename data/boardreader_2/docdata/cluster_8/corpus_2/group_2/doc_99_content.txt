                     Re: Need help financing a libert reserve USD account                                     Dude.    This is the most specific guide i can write, bear in mind that my money has just been paid to the place.    Create an account with Liberty Reserve, making sure you note down and keep safe your accoutn number, and your 4-5 digit pin, and a three digit number.    Go onto Goldnow and Click &amp;#039;Buy Gold&amp;#039; on the right hand side.    Fill out the simple form, obviously asking for Liberty Reserve $$    Always put a few quid more in, the site in question will give you more item if you pay them too much.    Choose Bank Transfer as the option.    Liberty Reserves Fees are listed on the site, so pay in a bit more.    After filling in the form, you will get a confirmation email.  Then within 24 hrs, you will get an email with payment instructions.    This involves depositing money into their account, in any barclays branch, and you don&amp;#039;t need an account with barclays to do so.    For the reference when paying in funds to their account via barclays, use your full name and order number.    Also, ask Barclays for the sort code of their branch, this way if the money goes missing, then it would be easier to sort.    Then you pop them an email to goldnow, saying that the money ahs been depositied, again quoting your order number.    They will reply usually within 24 hrs, and then it takes up to 48 hours for the funds to be deposited into your LR account.  They will email you to confirm this.    You then log into Liberty Reserve and your money is right there.    Log into your main account, using the 3 digit number mentioned earlier.  Then transfer funds to whomever you choose, the site in question will mention their LR account number once your order with them has been confirmed.    Then boom, confirmation from the site in question, and then it&amp;#039;s on its way.          Reading that through, it sounds daunting, but it really is a piece of piss.    This is the first time i have credited my account, and it worked fine for me.      Bear in mind, 86.10 GBP = $144.25 after all fees.    Obviously, any more questions, PM me.
