  People are getting there knickers in a twist because of change when in fact nothing has changed.  This personal reserve has always been on Barclays accounts except it&amp;#039;s called an anticipatory limit if you went into your A limit you were charged 30 if you went further into your A limit you are charged another 30 with a maximum of 3 charges a month. When exceed your A limit and a direct debit is returned then you are charged 35 maximum of 3 charges a month. Now with the new FSA rulings Barclays have dropped this charge to 8.  I don&amp;#039;t see the fuss nothing has changed except the name and the charges have dropped! The Personal Reserve is meant for use in an emergency and it is not compulsery. Any changes to T&amp;amp;amp;C&amp;#039;s of a bank account people have to be informed according to rules set by the FSA which is why the letters have gone out.  Obviously people who never go overdrawn and always have money in there accounts have taken offence to this but not all people are lucky like that and they might have to take advantage of the Personal Reserve if they need a payment made in an emergency.
