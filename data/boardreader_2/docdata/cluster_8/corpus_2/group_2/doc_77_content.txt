 I think they are a brilliant idea.  They should be rolled out by all banks as it would pretty much put an end to bank phishing and the millions of pounds that are stolen from people by it every year.      Sure, its slightly less convenient, but its well worth it.  The only improvement I would like to see is if they could issue a specific card for it instead of your debit card as I am always leaving my debit card in it when I go out.

That does seem a bit over the top.  When Barclays brought in the Pin Sentry, they dropped most of the passwords you have to enter.  Now its just membership number, last 4 digits of card and the code from the Pin Sentry.
