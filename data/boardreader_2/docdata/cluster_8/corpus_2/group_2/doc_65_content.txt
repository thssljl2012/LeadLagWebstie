I have read a few postings on here about recent cloning of card &amp;amp;quot;chips&amp;amp;quot; and whether the matter should be reported to the police.    My friends tell me when they initially visited Barclays they were told not to go the Police. However when they visited Barclays most recently they were told they should have reported the matter to the Police. Could it be Barclays have used this as part of their judgement and should this form part of the compliant.                      It appears the advice you get depends on who you speak to at Barclays. The first time my card was used fraudulently abroad, I contacted the Police and was told to report it to the bank who will contact them if further investigation was required. Barclays told me the same thing.          Quote:                         The member of staff at Barclays said they could appeal to the bank but they had no chance of winning as the &amp;amp;quot;chip&amp;amp;quot; issue meant the decision would not be reversed.                     What does &amp;#039;chip&amp;#039; issue mean? Sounds like an attempt to get them to give up. In my experience, what they write in the dispute claim form also gives weight to whether Barclays refunds the money or not. If they have stated that they have ever given the PIN to anyone else or have it written down somewhere, Barclays could claim they have been negligent so they don&amp;#039;t have to pay out.     I think your friends should take simongregson&amp;#039;s advice.
