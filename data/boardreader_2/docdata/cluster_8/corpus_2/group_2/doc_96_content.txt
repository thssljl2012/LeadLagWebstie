  Barclays and Barclaycard are impossible to complain to.  I had similar problems with SkyCard (run by Barclaycard) who allowed someone to open a Credit Card online in my name, using my previous address without asking for any ID. It was a complete nightmare getting to even look at it and even after the Fraud Dept admitted that it was a fraudulent application, their collection department were still chasing me for the debt. They only resolved the issue once I threatened to sue under Prevention of Harassment Act and for not taking due care under the Consumer Credit Act.  My son has had the same letter you had from Barclays Bank and no reply received after the 4 weeks they mentioned.  And they usually charge you for all phone cals via 0870.  So always dial their 0800 number and ask to be transferred. Then at least they pay for any hold-up on the phone.  Better still ONLY deal in writing with them, beacuse keeping good records of compalints over the phone is difficult.
