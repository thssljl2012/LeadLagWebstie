  I too have received 2 letters today from Barclays - I had opted out in August - I have never ever been overdrawn or had any banking problems, also had accounts with them for 30 years - they refused 3 direct debits so I have been charged 3 x 8 and rejected 2 payments made by debit card so another 2 x 8,   as not enough cleared funds - Barclays actually &amp;#039;sweeps over&amp;#039; cash every night into the current account - after 1 1/2 hours on the phone to them on a 0845 number they agreed it is an error their end but they dont know how to put it right without me opting back in..........  They did however agree to refund the 2 charges.
