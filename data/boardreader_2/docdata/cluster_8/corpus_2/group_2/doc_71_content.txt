The standing order section gave Barclays Bank, Leicester. The application form seems to go all over Britain.     I was very surprised to see posts about local branch staff keying in application details, &amp;amp;#8216;opening&amp;amp;#8217; accounts and clearing cheques. I was told the ISA office maintains complete control to ensure the regulations are complied with. I&amp;amp;#8217;d be interested to know if your sort code is affected by whether the branch keys in your application.    The local branch said once the ISA is opened, branches can&amp;amp;#8217;t credit subsequent cheque deposits.   They can only internal mail it to ISA branch   (normally without a receipt), so it gets credited and sent for clearing a day later. The ISA office says you can&amp;amp;#8217;t pay cash in at local branches. They recommend paying into a Barclays current account and then doing an instant telephone transfer. I asked what about people who don&amp;amp;#8217;t bank with Barclays, and was told this is a good question and they don&amp;amp;#8217;t have an answer.    I have since checked the terms and conditions, and clause 2.2 clearly allows &amp;amp;#8216; paying in a cash amount into any Barclays branch &amp;amp;#8217;. Surely, for cash or cheque, you could just fill in a blank paying-in slip at the counter completing the Barclays sort code plus putting 8 digit account no, and the cashier isn&amp;amp;#8217;t going to know? Only if you try to exceed the limits would it be flagged.                      I was refused for the branch to accept my paying in cheque this year, they said *I* had to post it to glasgow.  I never got round to it.    I was also not offered paying in cash as an option - but I was holding a cheque at the time.    My sort code is 20-44-55 which is not my local branch sort code -where I opened the account- and they took my cheques.    Has anyone worked out the withdrawal procedure?
