 If you claim through your own insurance policy regardless of who&amp;#039;s at fault, you&amp;#039;ll ALWAYS have to pay your deductible first.  Your insurance company will then look into the facts of loss, and if it&amp;#039;s determined that you were not at fault, your insurance company will subrogate against the other side&amp;#039;s insurance company.  What &amp;amp;quot;subrogate&amp;amp;quot; means is that your insurance company will get back all the money to cover the damages to you from the other insurance company, and that includes reimbursement of your deductible as well.  The reason why insurance companies do this is because they are repairing your vehicle regardless of whether you are at fault or not (and often before an assignment of fault is even made), so of course they have to have you adhere to the contract you signed with them (namely, your insurance policy).  If you don&amp;#039;t want to deal with your deductible period, wait for the other side&amp;#039;s insurance company to admit fault, then claim directly through them.
