 Before this Act, the banks were not permitted to mix their business with insurance companies like AIG. The banks were also not to mix their business with credit card companies. No other company could own a bank, and the bank couldn&amp;#039;t own part of another company.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Don&amp;#039;t you remember the bank cards that were debit only and we could bouce checks? The banks could not extend us credit at the drop of a hat, our checks would bounce if we didn&amp;#039;t have the money. When&amp;#039;s the last time you bounced a check?  &amp;amp;nbsp;  You are right that it wasn&amp;#039;t this one bill that did it, it was many, many before them also. BUT, the President, no matter what he wants, does not have any control of the money. Congress does. They have the sole duty of coining money, including the responsiblity of regulating it. Read the Constitution before saying that any President is responsible, or that any President can fix it. It&amp;#039;s in Section 8.
