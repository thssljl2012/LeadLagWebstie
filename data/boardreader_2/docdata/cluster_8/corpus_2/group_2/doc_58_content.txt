         My car insurance is due in the first week of October and I&amp;#039;ve been browsing around for the best price.  A quote with decent cover is through AIG and I can get 45 pounds cash-back if I buy through Quidco...  However, with the current problems with the credit crunch, etc, what would happen to my insurance if AIG did go under?  Thank you,  Oxford Sandy
