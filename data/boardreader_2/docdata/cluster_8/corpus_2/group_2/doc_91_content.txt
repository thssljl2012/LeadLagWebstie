  I decided to take out home insurance with Barclays last year after getting a quote that was less than half what I previously paid for the same cover - plus a 50 &amp;amp;quot;internet cashback&amp;amp;quot;. Big mistake. Their admin is incompetent, to put it mildly.    They sent the cashback cheque. But that&amp;#039;s all I received. No insurance documents - although I didn&amp;#039;t think much about it at the time. Then this year, no renewal notice. And I couldn&amp;#039;t find a way to get in touch with them. So I assumed that the insurance must have lapsed, and arranged alternative cover. Next month I see that they have raided my credit card for the next year&amp;#039;s premium without asking me. Two letters of complaint to different addresses received no reply. Then three large envelopes from Barclays home insurance thud on to my mat. Except that they are addressed to somebody I have never heard of, and refer to a property 200 miles away that I have no connection with. At least it gave me a third address to try, to see if somebody would finally bother to reply to one of my letters of complaint...
