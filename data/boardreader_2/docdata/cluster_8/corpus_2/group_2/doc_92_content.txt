Hmm, reading these posts it seems like everyone&amp;#039;s given their banks their phone numbers - I think I&amp;#039;ll let both Barclays and Barclaycard have my mobile number. I bet they&amp;#039;ve got my old old number from years ago so that&amp;#039;s why they never call...     I&amp;#039;ve had my current account cleared from 734 to 0.00 in the past due to a dodgy skimmed cashpoint, and Barclays (and the internet merchant who processed the &amp;#039;transaction&amp;#039;) were very good about it (I almost had 2 refunds!)
