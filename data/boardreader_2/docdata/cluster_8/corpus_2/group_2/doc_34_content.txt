  I wonder if there&amp;#039;s been any frantic calls to Alan Greenspan for advise?    Anyway, to sum up to see if I understand all this:  AIG is basically the insurance company for the financial institutions, ensuring that even if a bank goes belly-up peoples money are still safe.  Financial institutions didn&amp;#039;t notice in time when the bubble would bust so made a lot of bad loans and as a result are circling the drain.  Since it&amp;#039;s happening to all of the financial institutions the same time, AIG don&amp;#039;t have enough money to cover for all of them, since that&amp;#039;s not how insurance works (have all car owner crash at the same time and your car insurance would be worthless too).  The government is stepping in with a loan to AIG so then can prevent the banks from collapsing, so the people who actually saved money rather than borrowing more than they can afford won&amp;#039;t lose their savings.    What I don&amp;#039;t get is how this become taxpayers paying for bad loans?    It won&amp;#039;t stop foreclosures on the bad loans, since that&amp;#039;s basic damage control by the banks and they have to do that whether AIG gets money or not, what it will do is to make it just a little bit easier for the bank directors to keep the banks running than to take the big step to the pavement where they don&amp;#039;t have to worry about how to pay their lenders.    Remember, in the depression you needed more than an umbrella to be safe when walking Wall Street
