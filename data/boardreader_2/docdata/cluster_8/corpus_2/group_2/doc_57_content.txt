I&amp;#039;d say yes and no.  I&amp;#039;m about to go to the library, but AIG is an insurance company.  Every insurance company is taking a risk when they insure anyone.  They stay in business, so that means that people are paying more in than they are getting in return.  But some people are getting a lot more in return than they are paying in.  Health insurance is a great example.  You can live almost your entire life without having anything major happen.  On the other hand, you have a handful of people that get seriously ill/injured, and they are using their insurance to its limit.  The insurance company loses on those people.      Same thing with AIG, win some, you lose some.  But, its hard to prepare for something like our economy is going through right now.  When you have more people getting more than what they pay in than you do vice versa, the shit starts to hit the fan.      So yes, it might have been prevented, but at the same time, its really hard to say.  Someone has to undertake the job they have and if no one else can do it, I&amp;#039;d say our economy would be far worse off if no one was able to because the risks were too high.   -Cody      Btw, i dunno if its google chrome or what but i have to press tab twice now to hit submit
