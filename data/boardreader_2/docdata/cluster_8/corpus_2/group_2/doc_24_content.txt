 [quote]ORIGINAL:  launilee  I do believe that our taxes may rise to cover the money spent to bail them out. [/quote] [:&amp;#039;(] I have a feeling this is going to happen too. I&amp;#039;m hoping one of the financial geniuses on here will post. Our mortgage is through Wamu, but it&amp;#039;s fixed-rate, so other than another company taking it over, nothing else can happen, right? Our auto insurance is with AIG &amp;amp; I think I&amp;#039;ll switch asap just in case they decide to raise their rates or something.  We have 401k&amp;#039;s &amp;amp; money markets, but they get automatically &amp;amp;quot;moved around&amp;amp;quot; whenever the market goes wonky, so hopefully we&amp;#039;re not out too much... So, any of the financial-minded gals wanna make us feel better, or give us any advice?
