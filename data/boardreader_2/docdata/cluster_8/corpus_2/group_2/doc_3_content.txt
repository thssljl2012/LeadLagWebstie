  From personal experience my bank Nationwide did not freeze my account. I wrote to them and explained the situation and they agreed to keep my account running, I only ever had a current account with a cash card so if you do have a debit card you may find they &amp;#039;down grade&amp;#039; your account.     Just in case they do freeze your account here is a very handy link showing which accounts you can apply for after bankruptcy. Look at page 4.      http://www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk...k_accounts.pdf      I applied for a Barclays cash account to be on the safe side and it was accepted.      Hope this helps.
