Anyways, all this talk about how we should do whatever we can to avoid a Great Depression - sorry folks, but these short term gains are only going to hurt our long-term outlook, which means a future depression can be even more likely and even worse.      Unfortunately (or fortunately), capitalism goes in cycles, and y&amp;#039;know what? Maybe we Americans do need a depression every once in a while. My grandparents would have said &amp;quot;now you know what it was like.&amp;quot; Maybe we need that kick in the butt so people understand why saving money is important, why not being retarded with credit is important, etc. A big giant reset is needed.      As to why this all affects us? Cause they&amp;#039;re using my bloody taxpayer money to pay for some bailout of a company that got too greedy, took too much risk, and f&amp;#039;d up. If I go to Vegas, do I get my money back if I go all-in with pocket 8&amp;#039;s? No way!      And all this talk of taking over companies... in other countries when a government takes over 80% of a company, they call it nationalization. We&amp;#039;re seeing the seeds of socialism right under our eyes. Resources and national defense industries are arleady heavily under the mercy of the government, what next? I mean hey, we have the Fed and are taking over the financials already, why not more?!      We&amp;#039;re only shades away from being like China, only we seem to be going in opposite directions with regards to the economy.                           AIG failing 4 or 6 years ago.. great.. thats not a problem.. AIG failing now with the failling economy? catastrophe...  loss of jobs.. wages.. investments.. insurance policies..  AIG is a global company 130 locations.. over 100,000 employees in multiple countries.. AIG is the 18th largest company in the world.. no i didn&amp;#039;t say insurance company in the world.. i&amp;#039;m talking company overall.. 18th largest..       this isn&amp;#039;t Geico or Allstate going under here people.. this is major
