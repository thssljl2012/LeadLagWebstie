I know that there has been some dumb moves by the leadership of these companies, but weren&amp;#039;t they sold a pig in a poke like a bunch of other companies were?      Knowledgeable people help us out here.                      Common misconception...... AIG took it a step further.. they underwrote INSURANCE on those sub-prime accounts! YIKES!!!!!!!!!!!! They were the biggest and most profitable insurance firm on the planet and this was easy money.
