 Edited on Sun Sep-28-08 08:17 PM by 1corona4u         but what they didn&amp;#039;t think about is how AIG could have affected each one of us. I said the other day, AIG touches a lot of people&amp;#039;s lives, and they may not even know it. I got hurt on the job a few years back, and guess who my company&amp;#039;s liability insurance company was. AIG. They paid for all of my medical treatment, therapy, wheelchair, etc., while I was out of work for 6 months.  They also provide auto insurance. I guess people never stopped to think that if AIG would have folded, that they could have gotten in an accident on the way home from work, and someone who HAD been covered by AIG could have hit their car and totaled it. Sure your insurance would cover it, but guess who&amp;#039;s insurance is going up? Yours.  People just don&amp;#039;t think things through, I&amp;#039;m convinced of that.
