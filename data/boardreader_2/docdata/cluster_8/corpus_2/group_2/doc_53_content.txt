If they have a HP of 1200 a month and their income is 1200 a month their payment will be reduced to 300 a month.   People who continue to make payments keep their houses.   AIG - People and corportions that have insurance with them will have to get insurance elsewhere and people who have $ invested with them will loose their $.    Piglosi family has 9+ mil with them as do other Senators and Congressmen.    People will only collect 100k from the FDIC in the banking portion of AIG.   They eat any $ they have in excess of 100k.       Credit score of 700 will have nothing to do with it. Lenders will just look at payment history. There are some people with a low credit score that pay thir bills on time.   Car dealers, RV dealers, Real estate brokers are already looking at self financing to keep selling.                        Pretty accurate answer as near as I can tell.
