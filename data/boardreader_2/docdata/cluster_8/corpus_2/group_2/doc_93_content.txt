 Grr now I am getting annoyed with Barclays!    Every time I make a 100+ purchase with my Barclaycard Platinum it&amp;#039;s being flagged as a fraudulent transaction &amp;#039;outside the normal spending pattern&amp;#039;. Happened 3 times this year so far. I mainly use the card for big occasional purchases (for the protection), so there is no real spending pattern, and I keep having to phone them, annoyed as hell, to tell them to stop blocking it!    It was worse tonight as they blocked the card completely after I made 2 purchases online, one in Sweden, one in the US, and I couldn&amp;#039;t even see the card details online (&amp;amp;quot;this card is not available&amp;amp;quot;).    I understand the need to prevent fraud, but if it&amp;#039;s being cancelled/blocked every time I use it then that&amp;#039;s just bonkers.    As an aside, I received my new Barclays Visa Debit card this week and that was blocked too as soon as I tried to enter its details into a web subscription service I&amp;#039;ve used for years!! They just blocked the card! Now this annoys me more as they can see that I&amp;#039;ve used the site for 7 years, with monthy recurring transactions, so why they blocked it when I went to update my details on the site is beyond me.    Are all banks this inept in their &amp;#039;fraud&amp;#039; checking?
