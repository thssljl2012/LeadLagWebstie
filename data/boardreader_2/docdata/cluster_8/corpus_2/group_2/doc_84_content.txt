 Shortly before declaring myself bankrupt 2 months ago, I spoke to my local Barclays - with whom I&amp;#039;ve always banked and never once was overdrawn - and they assured me that there&amp;#039;d be no problems with opening a Cash Account.  Now they tell me that &amp;amp;quot;the computer&amp;amp;quot; won&amp;#039;t let them open one for me. They suggested that there might be something wrong with my history, but there isn&amp;#039;t - apart from the bankruptcy of course! As their Cash Account is promoted as being suitable for undischarged bankrupts, this seems illogical. They&amp;#039;ve now suggested that I look elsewhere for a bank account. I&amp;#039;ve got my final wage cheque being posted to me (having also just been laid off) and Barclays say that they can&amp;#039;t help me. I can&amp;#039;t go to the Co-Op as one of my bankruptcy debts was with their credit card arm. Can I open a Post Office cash account to get my monies paid in?
