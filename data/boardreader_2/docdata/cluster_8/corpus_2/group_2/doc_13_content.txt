Always in the past, other insurance companies have stepped in and &amp;amp;quot;bought&amp;amp;quot; the failing company.  AIG is too big for a purchase, so to keep from having infrstructure failure, they are making a &amp;amp;quot;loan&amp;amp;quot;.  It is painful and it is caused by mismanagement, but really, there is no other option if you want the country to not panic.                      Good points, but it still pisses me off. Just doesn&amp;#039;t seem right when the taxpayer is handed a bunch of receipts after the government determines where the money goes. - Og
