    Quote:             Originally Posted by  Magnum     Under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, (subject to limits and exclusions) if you buy anything on credit, your lender is responsible for the seller&amp;#039;s defaults.  Therefore if you use your credit card, your card company is liable, provided that your card account was not already in credit when you used it (if it was, you were just using your own money and weren&amp;#039;t buying anything on credit).  If you use a debit card then you are using money that you already have in your own account, unless you are using a pre-agreed overdraft. Therefore, again, you aren&amp;#039;t buying on credit.  VISA may have a private scheme for covering its own debit card customers, but it is not the same as the statutory scheme that applies to credit cards.                  Oh, yes, I realised that there was no statutory claim for people who had used debit cards and any refund would be at the discretion of the card issuer.    &amp;quot;Covered&amp;quot; probably wasn&amp;#039;t a very good word to have used in this context.  I should really have said &amp;quot;would get their money returned&amp;quot;.  Sorry.    I was just trying to say that I think that I would have been eligible for a refund with my debit card under the same scheme that maria received a refund after having used her debit card from Barclays Bank.    It would be interesting to know the position with debit cards issued by the other big banks.  Are they all in the Visa scheme now?
