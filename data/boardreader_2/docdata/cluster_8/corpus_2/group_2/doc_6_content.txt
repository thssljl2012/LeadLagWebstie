 Barclays says so far:      If the customer has made previous payments to their Halifax Credit Card via telephone banking or standing order/direct debt mandates, the payment details will be held on their records. Customers can then select from the history of regular payments who to make a payment to. This therefore removes the possibility of an incorrect digit being entered when online.        If the customer has never made a payment to Halifax Credit Card from their Barclays account, it would have been necessary for the customer to record the payment details first before they can make the payment online.       This process is aimed at reducing the possibility of the customer typing incorrect details.       While the account number entered was incorrect from the intended number, it does not always mean this results in a valid number with the other bank/credit card provider. In which case I believe the funds would be returned to the source account.       However, if the account does turn out to be valid with the other bank/credit card provider this does complicate the matter.       If you can please provide the customer&amp;#039;s postcode or account number I will be able to provide the clarity you and the customer are seeking.
