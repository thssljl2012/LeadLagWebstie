There seems to be plenty of such companies in America but I&amp;#039;ve yet to find any in the UK.       Cheers                             There is NO such thing as a credit card secured on a house. You don&amp;#039;t have to own a house to have a credit card. Miliions of people in the UK who don&amp;#039;t own their own home have credit cards.     ALL credit card companies report to CRA&amp;#039;s. Any card will do. If you have a poor/no history you should try your OWN bank first, then maybe Barclays Initial or Vanquis to see what they could offer.     Am I right in assuming you are new to the UK ?
