  I have had the same misinformation. I asked if Barclays did an Electron card and told them it was specifically for Ryanair flights.   I was told they had sold a number of these cards for that purpose. Eventually I got my card.  I tried all weekend to book flights without the transaction charges with no success. Phoned the Barclays helpline and was told it was an Electron card and that my card was fine. It was then suggested that the Ryanair site may in some way be defective.   All a waste of time. I will now open a Co-op account
