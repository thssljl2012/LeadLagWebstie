Lehman is an investment banker and mostly wealthy investors are hurt by their failure.                      It&amp;#039;s like this - if Nordstrom&amp;#039;s fails, how many of you would be affected?  Now, what if Walmart fails.........      Seems to me those of you who can&amp;#039;t stand to see fat cats get fatter and scream when your out of pocket expenses increase wouldn&amp;#039;t be complaining.  If AIG fails, your insurance rates for everything would probably double, and those states where the rates are regulated would wind up with no insurance companies doing business in those states at all.  This is already an issue in Massachusetts, there are quite a few majors that don&amp;#039;t write auto policies there.
