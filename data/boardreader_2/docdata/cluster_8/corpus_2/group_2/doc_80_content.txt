  Still waiting for 2008 ISA to be opened and I applied mid April, it&amp;#039;s now 15 September, 5 months later!  Is this a record?  I opened a 2007 ISA with Barclays on 1st April 2008 just in time before the end of the tax year.  This went quite smoothly and took a couple of weeks to process.  A few weeks later I added to the account the current years contribution, done in a local branch and a cheque handed over.  6 weeks later nothing, money still sitting in my current account awaiting transfer.. on ringing Barclays I was advised to stop my cheque as it must have gone missing and asked to post them another cheque, which I did with a letter quoting the complaint number I was given.  I have since received two letters both saying that my complaint is not yet resolved.    I have telephoned several times and each time am &amp;amp;quot;promised&amp;amp;quot; that  it will all be sorted and interest will be paid back to the date I first tried to add the 2008 money to my existing account.    Question..has anyone any ideas how to move this on?  Please...
