          this logic makes no sense at all. they want to solve the housing crisis buy selling off all the parts of AIG? do you realize how much real estate that AIG owns. if you try to sell them all right now you would flood the market and it would crash.       give each person $200,000? are you going to regulate how its spent? most idiots are not going to pay off debt. they are going to buy frivoulous things. and what happens to all the banks that have outstanding debt thats going to be all paid off. they will no longer have any income and could be part of this whole forclosure issue.       what about the deadbeats of this world? do they get it? prisinors? felons? who gets it and who doesn&amp;#039;t?       what about all the companies (mine included) that use AIG for insurance. you let them fail and we will all have to find a different insurance company. what if they other companies do not have enough insurance writers to get the policies in hand quick enough. what if they don&amp;#039;t have enough capitol to cover the policies?       the logic is horribly flawed. i hate to see our tax money go to a private company but on the same token, that private company has a HUGE bearing on the economy as a whole and if it fails many other things will snowball behind it.
