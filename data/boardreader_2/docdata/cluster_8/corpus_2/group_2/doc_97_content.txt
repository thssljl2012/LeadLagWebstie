 Big appologies for the double post but after reading this thread I think its more relevant to my problem and I would realy appreciate a bit of help ! Last year I opened a Barclays tax beater ISA and invested 3K in it and it has just been left for almost a year. Yesterday I went into my local branch and said as the interest rate for the tax beater is going down to 4.89&amp;amp;#37; I want to open a tax haven ISA and then transfer my money from the tax beater in to a new and higher rate tax haven, the person I spoke to just said &amp;amp;quot;no you cant do that&amp;amp;quot; and then went on to tell me that the only thing I could do is open a tax haven ISA then withdraw the money from the tax beater and put it into my newly openend tax haven ISA ? My question is have I been given the correct information and if so will I lose out if I take the money out of my current ISA, when I read the advice on this web site saying that Barclays were offering the best interest but be willing to transfer after a year I thought it would be simple and now I&amp;#039;m not sure of the best thing to do ?      Any help or sound advice realy appreciated !
