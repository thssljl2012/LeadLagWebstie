 My HOI and Auto insurance is with AIG. I called them today and told them that since my tax dollars bailed them out that I shouldn&amp;#039;t have to make anymore payments for the next couple of years. They didn&amp;#039;t think it was very funny. So I said, at the very least they should reduce my premiums. No such luck. I said fine, I guess I am in the market for a new insurance company. Then I hung up on them.
