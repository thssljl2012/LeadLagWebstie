 Anyone else here in this situation?  We have insured both cars (my present 318ti and the wife&amp;#039;s Honda) for years with AIG, they were 40% cheaper than Nationwide and seemed to give good service.  But now they may be going belly-up, what to do?   Switch quickly to GEICO or some other company?  Will AIG still pay claims on a timely basis if in Chapter 11?      If we switch, should it be ASAP? Or in October when the 128i arrives? Or at the next renewal in November?  If any of you know the auto insurance business well, please chime in
