 I was just looking for somewhere to move my ISA (from Natwest 4.6%) and Barclays sounded good, but after reading these last few posts I am thinking twice, It&amp;#039;s absolutly shocking!  Has anyone opened or transferred an ISA to Barclays recently? I assume most of the problems everyone had would have been due to the annual rush?
