I&amp;#039;m not sure if this is still the case, but some time ago when I worked at Barclays, we were not able to issue Visa Debit (Connect) cards to under 18&amp;#039;s, reason being they did allow offline transactions to go through below the retailers floor limit, meaning that if a customer had no money, they would be pushed into an overdraft, something which would be unlawul for the bank to do to an under 18.    Then the Visa Electron came along, which made life a little easier for this younger market and they could be used in online terminals as they would push for authorisation every time they were used.     I may suspect that this is the case with Nationwide. A lot of banks will issue &amp;#039;Debit&amp;#039; cards to under 18&amp;#039;s but they are more likely to be the &amp;#039;force online type&amp;#039; i.e. Visa Electron, and Solo. And you might not find out until you move your account and the card is issued.
