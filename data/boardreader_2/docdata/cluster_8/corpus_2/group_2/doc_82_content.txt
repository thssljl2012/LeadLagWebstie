  If you are an Abbey customer then it is they who will deal with you and not Barclays.  It is highly unlikely that Barclays would have balanced their machine and responded to an inter bank cashpoint dispute query in &amp;#039;a matter of days&amp;#039; and without getting your side of the story in writing.     Keep at Abbey is my advice.
