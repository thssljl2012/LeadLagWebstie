                     Goldfish down taken over by Barclays                                      I have had a Goldfish card for many years and in that time it has been through several owners.  It has now been taken on by Barclays, who have written to say they are going to issue account holders with a new card, and I think, a new account number.  For this reason and also a general dislike of Barclays, i have decided to end it.     Are there any especially attractive offers out there in terms of Quidco cashbacks?
