Be prepared to grab a mirror and look deep into it.  The current economic situation is our own doing and it WILL only get worse.  The fallout of this will continue until each of us either loses everything, or completely change our demands and personal lifestyle.  The only people that are exempt from this blame are those that have only ever paid cash for anything they own.  I know that this is a gross simplification, but anyone that has ever purchased a plasma TV, couch, car, fancy dinner or any luxury on a credit card WITHOUT the money in the bank to immediately pay it back has helped cause this problem, which has not yet reached its bottom.  Zero percent financing, no payments for 12 months, consolidate now and save.  This problem has created a multi-layered disaster that is still unfolding.      First - (and no, don&amp;#039;t blame the credit card companies for competing, you didn&amp;#039;t have to accept every single offer they sent you on a daily basis), Credit card companies that apparently forgot to create an &amp;amp;quot;application denied&amp;amp;quot; branch of their business accepted pretty much anyone and everyone and gave us massive credit lines to do with what we want.  Since the American person is convinced that you can have anything and everything you&amp;#039;ve ever wanted starting at age 18 without having to pay any dues.  They spent, and spent, and spent, and spent, and spent.  Meanwhile, the &amp;amp;quot;fundamentals&amp;amp;quot; of the economy looked absolutely fabulous, because, &amp;amp;quot;look at all the money being spent and all the stuff being bought!&amp;amp;quot;.  The problem, however, and the housing market (the most expensive expense) is, of course, the first bubble to burst.  Because, guess what, people didn&amp;#039;t spend REAL money.  They spent borrowed money and they spent way, way, way beyond their means.        So after the horrific mistake of the tech boom, people decided to drown their sorrows with monopoly money supplied by Visa, Mastercard, Discovery, etc, and of course, the much bigger cash cows, Banks and larger lending institutions (once again, only the FIRST to fall on their face in this crisis).  Those ill managed, &amp;amp;quot;this golden run will never end&amp;amp;quot; morons then leveraged themselves beyond any dollar amount they could possibly collect in a reasonable amount of time.  The first to fall were the ones with the biggest debts that could not be collected, houses.        An aside - When banks went belly up after teh crash in 1929, they had no insurance support to protect themselves, and the government, at that time, also leveraged and in a deficit, could not bail them out, and we lost our tails.  Thus, the patchwork solution, create the FDIC and let banks be backed by &amp;amp;quot;highly&amp;amp;quot; rated insurance companies.  Back to our story...      Second - The next peg on our block and the next layer of defense is now the insurance companies.  While we are not finished seeing major banks and financial institutions go belly up, we are getting ready to see our nations linebackers miss some tackles.  AIG (the biggest) will be the first major insurance company to lose because of this disaster.  Can you imagine why?  They too, have held a &amp;amp;quot;this golden run will never end&amp;amp;quot; philosophy of finance.  Because, &amp;amp;quot;hey, look at all that money thats being spent, who cares if its real, there&amp;#039;s just no way a large American bank could go under with the &amp;amp;quot;fundamantals of our economy so strong&amp;amp;quot;.  oops.  BTW, you&amp;#039;ll notice that insurance companies get such high credit ratings because of the capital they have, but not the ratio of capital they have to payouts they &amp;#039;could&amp;#039; potentially have to funnel out.  In fact, any financial institution that has the insurance backing of an insurance company has the promise of billions in protection against bankruptcy, corruption, or flatout stupid management.  Care to guess how that relates to REAL money that insurance companies have in the bank in the case of a fallout?  So, when the insurance companies go belly up and can&amp;#039;t payout the massive landfall claims that teh banks need to remain solvent, step two of our wonderful next decade takes its full effect, leading us to step 3.        Next, the government.  Fortunately, each of us has $100,000 FDIC protection on all moneys we have invested in one specific bank.  If you&amp;#039;re wise enough to spread your money over multiple institutions, you have 100,000 in protection for each one.  Any money over that, you can kiss goodbye when banks go under.  Too bad you worked those 5 extra years before retiring and lumping all your money in that 4% CD.  We can&amp;#039;t help you beyond that.  Well, the reality, our government can&amp;#039;t REALLY help us up to that $100,000 that they&amp;#039;ve promised in FDIC protection, at least once a large enough cross section of the population starts to need it from this fallout.  If the BOA/Merril merger doesnt&amp;#039; work out for instance, can you fathom the concept of the US needing to payout a few million claims of lost savings up to and around $100,000?  Imagine our national debt being multiplied exponentially in order to do that.  Guess that means step 4...      Either those people losing their life savings from the bank gets responded to by our wonderful government (who, by the way, are probably invested strictly in middle Eastern oil at this point, at least %75 of their wealth) will give us a nice pat on the head and say, better luck with your kids.  There are a few soup kitchens down the street.  We&amp;#039;ll let you know when we need you or your kids to fight in the next war we start.  Glad for that Bush Doctrine precedent, because Iran is looking tasty.  OR, we will do like good Americans during the Bush administration, we&amp;#039;ll borrow more money from China, India and Europe, basically sending teh American dollar further into the world&amp;#039;s toilet than it has been since before WWII (we&amp;#039;re already heading that way), and pricing any American individual out of such luxuries as Chinese made toilet paper, t-shirts or bandaids).  I&amp;#039;m sure that McCain and Bush will not only pay those insurance claims out to us on borrowed Chinese money, they will also give us another $1500 pittance tax cut (also borrowed), with the simple instructions (once again) of &amp;amp;quot;go spend it on something fruitless and needless, or else the terrorists win&amp;amp;quot;.  BTW, the government can&amp;#039;t afford to run on the current tax cuts, OR if we raise taxes on Everyone, so I don&amp;#039;t know where this imaginary money will come from, but for inflationary purposes, they better start printing trillion dollar bills, just like Zimbabwe.  Loaf of bread anyone?       Now, if 22 year olds (and 42 year olds for that matter) would realize that just because their parents own a nice boat, two cars, two mortgages, and 10 TVs with 400 channels, that they need to possibly wait and actually pay CASH for those luxuries, we might solve this problem.  In the 1950&amp;#039;s, people didn&amp;#039;t own two cars, in fact, many walked everywhere.  You owned a car when you could go down to the car dealer and hand him cash (or check, know what that is?) for a car that they then kept beyond the 5 year maximum that most people maintain today (hey, I don&amp;#039;t want my image tattered by a 6 year old automobile).  People didn&amp;#039;t buy a house unless they had no other debt, and a great portion of a downpayment needed to ensure that they could pay off their houses.  Sure, the economy back then didn&amp;#039;t grow at 15-20% every single year (which is just so exciting to watch), but it grew with REAL money backing it.  Not another bubble created by e-trader speculation and &amp;amp;quot;earnings&amp;amp;quot; reports that include money &amp;amp;quot;earned&amp;amp;quot; by mainstream companies based on credit card sales for each quarter.        Until we realize that spending 60% of your starter income on a $250,000 mortgage payment (I was approved for up that amount when I first started house hunting, and that was on a $40,000 a year teachers salary, of course, I paid $120,000 for my first house), then adding 100 channels of cable, a PS3, satellite internet, leasing a 15 mile per gallon SUV, an IPOD with 400 paid for songs on it, AND a massive blu-ray collection isn&amp;#039;t a good idea, we will continue down this road to ruin.        When McCain stated that by &amp;amp;quot;fundamentals&amp;amp;quot; he meant the American worker is strong, he was even wrong about that.  Because the American worker tends to also be the American spender, and the American spender tends to think that the upper class lifestyle includes anyone that qualifies for a credit card balance, which is anyone.  Now, you won&amp;#039;t hear politicians talk about the American people as the real problem.  They will continue to blame everyone else when a crisis happens, because they can&amp;#039;t do anything to make the problem worse if you don&amp;#039;t continue to vote for them.  Of course, once this &amp;amp;quot;trickle down&amp;amp;quot; of four steps hits us, the only solution that will be presented to us is, &amp;amp;quot;Don&amp;#039;t panic, keep buying stuff, its the only way to keep the economy from going down, and we, as the government, don&amp;#039;t care about your own personal credit woes adn bankruptcy, as long as you spend, you can keep your job, oh, and heres another credit card.&amp;amp;quot;   In reality, we REALLY NEED a large recession to reset our market levels to REAL levels, not inflated levels dictated by credit.  When the markets, demands and supplies of goods and services actually reflect what people are able to REASONABLY pay for and maintain, then we will start to see real growth, as opposed to &amp;#039;bubble&amp;#039; growth, which has been the truth behind each of the last 3 market growth periods.        Another aside - It took the Dow 79 years to grow from 100 points to 2000 points, it took 22 years for the Dow to grow from 2000 points to 14000 points.  Anyone ACTUALLY think that thats based on REAL value?        So STOP listening to politicians telling us to spend.  Start saving (your going to need it because a lot of jobs will be lost soon enough), and start encouraging people to be smart.  Rip up those credit card offe...
