This in effect cuts away the dead stuff to let the alive stuff to get going again. This is Laiseez-faire.                      Lasieez-faire is government&amp;#039;s taking the most minimalist approach to economy possible.  Let me give you an example of where that would&amp;#039;ve been an epic fail, take the bailout of AIG.  Let&amp;#039;s go under the assumption AIG went under and the government didn&amp;#039;t bail them out.  Then all of the insurance plans on the mortgages other banks had would&amp;#039;ve gone bad, that means other banks would be in even worse shape than they are now.  On top of all that alot of American&amp;#039;s had insurance through AIG of retirement plans.
