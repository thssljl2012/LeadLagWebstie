Has anyone opened or transferred an ISA to Barclays recently? I assume most of the problems everyone had would have been due to the annual rush?                       The Post Office Cash ISA  is offering the same 6.25% rate as Barclays Tax Haven ISA  and  permits transfers in, which the Tax Haven does not - it&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;new cash only&amp;#039;.
