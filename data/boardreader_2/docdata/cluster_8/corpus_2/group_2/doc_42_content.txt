               Quote, originally posted by  chet  &amp;amp;raquo;      i just hope we remember how stupid it is to buy what we can&amp;#039;t afford and start living more within our means...minus credit cards, car payments and houses we can&amp;#039;t afford...cause that is the key to a steady economy.     LMAO our society will never abide by this simple task, it would be too much like the right thing to do. I had about 5 calls today from clients who own AIG life insurance policies that i wrote for them, alot of them were concerned about how safe they are going to be with this mess.  I told them Until we really know what will happen with AIG its unsure at this moment but i told them i would gladly replace theire policies with another company if they want out now! Its crazy just 3 weeks ago i was telling a client that AIG was the #1 in global insurance portfolio, they have now falled to #2 and AXA has now taken its place.
