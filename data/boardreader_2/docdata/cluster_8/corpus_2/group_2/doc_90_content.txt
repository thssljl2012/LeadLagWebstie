They are charging 22.00 every 5 days!  I have complained and asked for the facility to be removed from my account (it was applied without asking anyway).  O.K. I know I should have been more scrupulous in checking the charges but had two hectic weeks and didnt!  Now, I am 66.00 out of pocket and have learnt my lesson!  Barclays bordered on being quite rude on the phone.  I think that people should have to ask for the Reserve to be put on and sign something accepting the fees.                      So what you are saying is you have been over your limit for approx. 15days.    I personally would rather pay 22 for 5days than pay the 35 charge for each time they paid something when I didn&amp;#039;t have the money. (Maximum 3 per day so 105 in one day)
