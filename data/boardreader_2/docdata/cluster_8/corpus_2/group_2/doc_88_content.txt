  I checked my bank account today and found that I had received 3 charges of 8 added to my account today. Unsure of why I had received these charges as I under an impression that I had a buffer on my overdraft of at least 5 as wasn&amp;#039;t really concerned about the being 3 over my overdraft. So i phoned Barclays up tonight when I got home from work to find out that i had been charged these as a guaranteed transaction fee.    I was on the phone for nearly an hour as they were trying to tell me that they had to guarantee a debit card payment. First they were telling me it was for a payment that I made for my mobile phone but when I made that payment i still had a 100 left in my account. Then it was for my card payment that did take me over my limit. Which I could just about understand. However it was for the double payment the following day they were telling me the fees were for a stand ordering that had gone out that day and a card payment that day at about 5.30. However i actually been paid that day as well. So they were basically saying that had to guarantee the payment so charged me the 8 twice, even though my salary had gone into my bank account. All I can say is thankgod I used my card once that day. I have however manged to get these 2 charges refund, though only once after I had broke down in to tears on the phone.     It did take me nearly an hour to get to the bottom of the charges as they keep tell me it was because the shop where the card transaction had taken place as had ask for a guarantee which meant the Barclays has to charge this to my account. However as I kept pointing out to the person I hadn&amp;#039;t actually gone overdrawn and  was well in my overdarft limit.     I am now scared to use my debit card now on days when I get paid as they are just going to place charges on my account for no reason.     Has any one else experience this problem.......
