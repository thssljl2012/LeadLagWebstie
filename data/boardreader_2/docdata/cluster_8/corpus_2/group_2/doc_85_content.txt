 I got an extra 150 thought this was good as first but wish id opted out because now ive gone into it its hard to get out when they keep putting 22 fees onto it, I am making payments on my account when theres money in and sometimes its taking barclays upto 5 days to take the money out they are then charging me 8.00, they can charge you up to 40 a day for guranteed transaction fees, so how they think they are helping people I dont know at least the old charges were only upto 90 per month, when I ring the bank to say I have money at the time of payment they said its down to the company I pay when they take the money and not down to barclays, how is this when I pay by debit card through a machine that connects to the bank? Then today they took a direct debit out my account then returned it unpaid even though my balance shows I have enough money, again no one helped me with this and just fobbed me off with aload of rubbish.
