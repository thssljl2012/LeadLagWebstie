    Caliii,   &amp;amp;nbsp;   Ok, let them fall, but what happens then?   &amp;amp;nbsp;   Every single customer of AIG gets screwed. Thats what happens.    &amp;amp;nbsp;   Everyone always seems to have this magic view that its only the corporation itself   that gets screwed and its just the feds helping their buddies out. Its far from that, if    you do not bail out financial firms like banks, then people&amp;#039;s money in that bank goes   bye bye.    &amp;amp;nbsp;   Imagine your bank. If it were to go under suddenly in this, and the Fed did not bail it   out, you would no longer have your money. Gone, nothing, not entitled to it. FDIC can   only insure so far, it will run out quickly and past that, its great depression II.    &amp;amp;nbsp;   I honestly cannot believe anyone would even consider contesting the government doing    these bailouts. Its the only thing keeping half the country out of&amp;amp;nbsp;the bread line, solely   because they had money deposited in a bank.&amp;amp;nbsp;With AIG, an investment insurance firm,   you have an enormous amount of people dependant on their insurance, and enormous    amount of people dependant on financial packages invested in AIG, and so on, all of    whom would get screwed one war or another if the bailout didn&amp;#039;t occur. Why the hell   would anyone have a problem with that?
