Salam,      I never understood why british ppl do not have any proper identification document with the main information on it... Most of Europeans have ID cards and passports (if they travel). ID card is very handy, because you can carry it with you in your walet, not like passport. In Spain, for example, you will be asked to prove your identification if you want to pay by debit/credit  card. Those who dont drive, would have to carry passport with them all the time...      I never undestood ho utility bills are so important in the UK, I was shocled when 3 yrs ago I went to Barclays to open my bank account, I had passport, ID card, birth certificate etc, but that was not enough, they wanted a payed utility bill or a driving licence. As I don&amp;#039;t drive and have just arrived to the country I was stuck... Few months later I opened a bank account in NatWest. But I needed my friends account to be able to recieve my salary for the first 3 months...      Really, the sistem in UK with regards to identification documments is so strange and not flexible at all...
