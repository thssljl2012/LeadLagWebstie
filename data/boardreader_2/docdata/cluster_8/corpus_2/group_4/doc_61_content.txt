I think you need to take control of some money for yourself so you&amp;#039;re not left without when he decides to spend all the money.     Have you opened your own bank account yet? You could get the child benefit paid into this (that&amp;#039;ll be 175 once No.3 comes along) and put the grocery money in it each month so at least you know you&amp;#039;ll be able to buy food and have a bit extra for the children.     If he then raids the other account and bills don&amp;#039;t get paid he might, just might, realise he&amp;#039;s got to stop.                      Thanks, No have not opened another account yet.. Ive opened a paypal topup though for the food and kids stuff...  I should sort out the co-op account really.. (cant go barclays I owed them too much LOL) can you do co-op online?? I dont go into banks with my kids they are nightmares!!     So with Co=op and paypal I should be able to seperate my own money to keep myself under control and pass the buck to him on his account.. He honestly has no idea..  His last comment  &amp;amp;quot;I thought our monthly bills were 2.5K&amp;amp;quot; Erm no for the last year they have been 3.5 - 4... no wonder we got in this mess!!!  With my BR they have gone down a bit thankfully but he still needs to learn!
