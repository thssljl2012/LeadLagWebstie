I know I have to mention without prejudice when I write to them, however is there a template letter for this anywhere?     Thanks                      Hi rushdoo,     I used the second template letter and just edited it at the without prejudice part, saying:-     The charges i have claimed above total *****. However i am prepared to accept your offer of **** plus 8% interest as a  part payment  towards the amount I am claiming and I therefore ask that you pay me the remainder of the balance.     I look forwad to a full response to this letter within 14 days, otherwise I will commence court proceedings to reclaim my money.     Now i only sent this letter on 5th June and havent yet received a response from them but they tend to answer in about 10 days.     Hope this has been of some help to you
