Methinks this is bad advice and legally B/W have no leg to stand on.                      Some banks have &amp;amp;quot;collars&amp;amp;quot; written in to the small print of their tracking deals.  This is basically a set % below which they will not track the BOE rate.  Perhaps this large cut means they&amp;#039;ve reached that collar.      EDIT:  Or what Migster said!
