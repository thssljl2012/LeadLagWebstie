 Applied 8 April at the bank and heard nothing until to-day when I had a letter asking me to take my passport into a branch.  The FA at Barclays photocopied my passport in April.   I rng the no on the letter and got someone with such an impenetratable accent that it was difficult to make sense of anything.  Interest should be backdated if it was the bank&amp;#039;s fault (Like 2 months is normal!) and she has escalated my complaint.    Is it worth abandoning Barclays altogether and going somewhere else?
