Basically I&amp;#039;m asking, do we know their reasoning on this?  I&amp;#039;m not so sure deep down, but at least on outward appearance they are trying to show they have the American people in mind, so what would happen if the bailout didn&amp;#039;t go through?                      AIG wrote a bunch of insurance policies (Credit default swaps/CDS) on bonds that are held all around the world.    These bonds are owned all over the world.  The financial stability of the companies that own these bonds are (in part) backed up by AIG&amp;#039;s ability to stay in business.  If AIG goes out of business, they will have to settle these CDS&amp;#039;s.  Also, if AIG goes out of business, these other financial institutions will incur additional credit liquidity stress.    That&amp;#039;s more money than anyone wants to cough up right now.  They&amp;#039;d rather just have some time pass and those swaps expire.   After then, no one cares if AIG goes out of business.    Basically, AIG wrote a bunch of insurance that no one wants to be on the hook for.
