 Which bank do you have a childs account with?    How much do you put into their account and when can they touch it?   I am looking at opening an account for the boys but just have th 1 account between the 2 of them. I was hoping to have it so they can&amp;#039;t touch the money til they are 21.  We currently bank with ANZ.
