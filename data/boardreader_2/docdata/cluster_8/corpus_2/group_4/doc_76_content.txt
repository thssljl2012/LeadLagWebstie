 well done you for taking the first steps....they are the hardest!  Dont worry about barclays etc, barclays were one of my biggest creditors &amp;amp;amp; they offered me a basic bank account, try &amp;amp;amp; get together what you can for the cccs interview explain your circumstances &amp;amp;amp; if your missing ammounts etc estimates are ok     The panic gets worse as BR day approaches...after that you&amp;#039;ll wonder what all the fuss was about (its   really not as worse as your imaging)        Keep posting here &amp;amp;amp; everyone will try help you best they can     Phil
