 Hi again       There are two main accounts that bankrupts can have:     Coop cashminder  Barclays (basic?)     Most people have applied before going bankrupt but you have to stress to the bank that you want their basic account, if you do it this way you have to declare it when you go BR but once you go BR let the OR know that this is your account for use post BR and it should be left alone (only one person I know have has difficulties)     I actually got mine after as I had a bit of time before I got paid so could afford to be referred and have to wait a few days for it to go through. This meant I didn&amp;#039;t declare it as I didn&amp;#039;t have it before I went BR
