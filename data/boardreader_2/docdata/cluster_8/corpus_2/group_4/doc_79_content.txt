 I applied for the ISA on 24 April online, having already had a current account with them for 11 years. I quickly received the standard letter about a four week delay. After four weeks were up I complained, then I received another letter telling me my complaint will be dealt with by 20 June. Last week I rang the complaint line and got a useless operator who told me nothing could be done until my complaint was resolved. Today I rang the savings line and was told my ISA could not be opened as my address was marked &amp;#039;gone away&amp;#039; because post had been returned. This is strange since I moved house 18 months ago, my address is correct and I have since received statements and letters about my ISA application and complaint in the last few weeks. I was told I had to go to my local branch and have the &amp;#039;gone away&amp;#039; marker removed. I did this today, they rang someone and apparently my account will be opened in 1-2 weeks with backdated interest. I will believe it when I see it.
