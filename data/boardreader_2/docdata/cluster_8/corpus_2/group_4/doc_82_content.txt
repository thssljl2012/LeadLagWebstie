  I&amp;#039;m in a pretty stressful situation, applied months ago for what is now an astonishingly good tracker rate from the Woolwich (0.69% above base rate). I had a letter of acceptance 3 weeks ago, but stupidly had failed to include my wife&amp;#039;s name on the application. So we had to fill in a form to &amp;#039;vary&amp;#039; the application - crucially it&amp;#039;s not considered a brand new application - and we were assured by our salesman that we would still be given the same rate.      Today&amp;#039;s news potentially throws all that up in the air.    Question now is, are we in danger of having the offer withdrawn, despite having paid the application fee (which I would hope might somehow guarantee the rate). My hunch is that the bank has the right to pretty much do what they like, and could even withdraw the offer between exchange and completion.    Does anyone know if I am right to be s***ting myself?
