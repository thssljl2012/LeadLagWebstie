It&amp;#039;s hard to understand what made AIG worth saving, but not the core of our manufacturing ability.                                                    American International Group, Inc. (AIG), a world leader in insurance and financial services, is the leading international insurance organization with operations in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions.       Insured all the bad debts to everyone. This would be a ripple effect as lots of banks would not be insured (fail) and AIG would be wiped off the face of  the earth with debt. Think underfunded pensions as a good analogy.     Not saying they should get one just saying this was a no brainier IF you help them out.
