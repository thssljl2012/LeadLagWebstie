 Hello everyone - how are you all?      Can i pick your brains again please? I opened a co-op basic account when i went br and everything was fine up until about 2 months ago when i had a letter saying they were closing it because it had not been run correctly.  As far as I can see I had one incident where my dd came out a day before my benefits went in (taking me 2 into the red  )... either way, it is now shut.... blurgh!     I have since applied for a barclays account but *still* havent heard anything.     If I am turned down for barclays, co-op wont have me and the post office only accept benefits but not wages.... do i have any other options should I be fit enough to get a job again?      Thank you in advance for any help you can offer - you all rock
