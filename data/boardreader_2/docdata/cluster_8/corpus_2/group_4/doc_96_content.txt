The draft itself makes reference to the Canadian bank that the draft is to be drawn against.      It sounds more complicated than it is, just make sure you take the details from the CHC London website in with you to the bank so that all the information is correct      Good luck                           Hi, I did exactly the same as you with our Barclays bank here in Manchester. So when I went to collect the draft,should it be Barclays that have debited the money from our account,at their exchange rate not the receiver general for Canada,what should i look for on my bank statement? sorry confused!
