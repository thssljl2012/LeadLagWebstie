         I went BR at the end of Sept still waiting for OR to let me know how this will end. But because I had  Joint Loan 9.500 with husband it has now become his loan which he can&amp;#039;t pay because he only has a pension. No help from the HALIFAX who says we are not far enough behind with payments for it to be re scheduled. Husband opened a cash card account with the Halifax which my salary and all the bills are paid from Question When my other half goes down the BR route when should I change my account to the Co op or Barclays ( as I understand these are the only 2 banks BR&amp;#039;s can use?)  WE have a frozen current account which is overdrawn when OH goes BR will this also be taken into account and cleared with the loan?
