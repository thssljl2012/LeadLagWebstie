 I have a loan with Barclays that I took out 2 years ago, and have a 3 year period in which to pay it back. I just called Barclays asking if it is possible for me to drop the amount I am paying back (currently 218 per month) by maybe 80-100 less and extend the period with which to pay back. I am getting married next year and the extra money every month will come in handy.   Barclays (in India) told me due to some English Law or another I am unable to change the payment amount, all he could do was offer me a month&amp;#039;s &amp;amp;quot;holiday&amp;amp;quot; and then I pay double the next month, which doesn&amp;#039;t really help as I am not getting married until September.   I am sure my sister did what I was asking for with her loan, has something changed? Or am I really not allowed to do this?   Baffled??? (he did also ask me if I owned my own house, when I told him I didn&amp;#039;t he said he would pray for me that I got one, one day - very strange)
