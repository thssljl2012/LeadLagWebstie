Methinks this is bad advice and legally B/W have no leg to stand on.                        Depends on the legal wording of her mortgage. A lot have wording stating they will pass these on except for certain circumstances where it could damage the bank.    So no they don&amp;#039;t they will have to write to inform you though and give a certain amount of notice.
