I had my debit card copied a couple of years ago and the bank (HSBC) were on it really quickly, none of the transactions (totalling nearly 800) ever appeared on my statement and I did not lose any money.    Why won&amp;#039;t Barclays do anything? What difference does it make if it was done in the UK? That sounds like really poor service to me.    Report it to the police so you can at least get a crime number(?) then at least there is a record of you doing it. Next, shout at Barclays!
