hello please help!!!!!!    Early this year i received a final demand from Dm Limited and quite a threatening letter at that saying i owed 600.00 and if it wasnt paid baliffs would come round. at the time i was struggling financially and panicked. When i phoned them they were extremely snotty and said the debt was from 10 years ago when i was a student and it was BArclays BAnk that wanted the money back. I said i couldnt remember having this debt and no paper work from 10 years ago for me to refer to. Stupidly i offered them a repayment. I have paid back 300.00 pound worth of the debt already. I looked for advice at the time and the advice i received was just to offer them a small amount. anyway to cut a long story short they are now harrassing me at work as i am paying less back a month.     Should i cancel the standing order. or now because i have paid some of the debt back am i admitting the debt so will have to continue.     PLease help.    maiden
