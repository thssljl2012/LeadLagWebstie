 Hi, B_B,      I see you have been a member for a while so you probably know all this but here goes anyway.   You can get your wages paid into a pre-paid card. You can get a weekly or monthly cheque for benefits which you can cash at the PO and load your card up at the same time. Some of these cards have facility for d/d&amp;#039;s. They do charge but you can shop around for intro offers and just be careful which atm you use. I have looked into them recently and I&amp;#039;m getting one just in case my co-op account goes pear shaped. The only disadvantage I can see is the fee and the time it takes cash deposits to clear but again you can check that stuff before you apply.   Hope you get your Barclays account but if you don&amp;#039;t at least you can consider the above.       Good luck
