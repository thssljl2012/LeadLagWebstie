If AIG goes out of business, they will have to settle these CDS&amp;#039;s.  Also, if AIG goes out of business, these other financial institutions will incur additional credit liquidity stress.      That&amp;#039;s more money than anyone wants to cough up right now.  They&amp;#039;d rather just have some time pass and those swaps expire.   After then, no one cares if AIG goes out of business.      Basically, AIG wrote a bunch of insurance that no one wants to be on the hook for.                      Made a bad bet on AIG staying in business, pay the piper.      This slope is going to be slippery, we have automakers asking for money, credit companies will be next (I think they already have), and then who knows where else we can ride this magical train of bailout.  We are propping up our whole economic standing on s*** companies who can&amp;#039;t operate correctly.  This is all going to end in a train wreck later down the line.
