          okay, we&amp;#039;ve bailed out the financial sector, and the auto industry wants a bail-out, what&amp;#039;s next? Insurance?

Yes, AIG&amp;#039;s issues were with insurance on financial instruments (credit default swaps), but insurance companies are heavily invested, and have you looked at the stock and bond markets lately?  Next will be municipalities and states.....Jefferson County, Alabama (Birmingham&amp;#039;s county) is already trying to get money:  http://www.al.com/news/birminghamnews/statebriefs.ssf?/base/...
