 I&amp;#039;m with Barclays/Woolwich on a lifetime tracker. i only get a statement once a year but yes, the rates should be passed on.      i am on base + 0.59%. my T&amp;amp;amp;C&amp;#039;s are quite clear in my opinion.           Quote:                         But it is better luck if you&amp;#039;re with Abbey, RBS or Woolwich. They all said this week that their tracker rates would go as low as the BoE base rates dared.                     i understand there is alot of talk on these forums about &amp;amp;quot;what if&amp;amp;quot; but i am more interested in an answer to my questions rather than starting another &amp;amp;quot;what if&amp;amp;quot; thread.      thank you.
