Head over to fatwallet.com and check out the finance forum.  Read the &amp;amp;quot;which credit card should I get&amp;amp;quot; thread and you will find links to lists of all 0&amp;amp;#37; offers out there.  Also read any recent threads with AOR (app-o-rama) in the title, along with the sticky about AORs.      Right now Citi, BoA and US Bank have some good no fee offers. Chase has removed the cap on fees on everything except the Disney card, which is $50.  Amex has no 0% offers right now.  Barclays and HSBC also have some with low caps.        All cards give you at least 30 days after opening the account to do your BT.  Citi is the only one (IIRC) that starts the clock when  you take the transfer.  All of the others start counting from the account opening date.        I hope you realize that putting credit card money in anything that is not 100% sure is a huge risk.  If you are late on a single payment you might find that your rates get jacked up to 29% instantly.        I do play the 0% game to some extent, but I keep the cash liquid and FDIC insured.  I am paying for my car via 0% offers, but that is backed by my HELOC, so if something goes wrong I can pay off the CC in 24 hours and at worst pay prime, which ends up around 4% after taxes.
