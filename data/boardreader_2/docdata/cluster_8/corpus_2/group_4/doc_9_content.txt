Depending on the bank, they could bounce your payment and charge you a fee - I remember making a payment from a bank which shall not be named (CBA) to a company with an ampersand (&amp;amp;amp; symbol) in their name, which internet banking would not allow - I substituted the &amp;amp;amp; with &amp;amp;quot;and&amp;amp;quot; and the payment bounced with a $2.50 fee.    It took three phone calls and two escalations to get my fee back   and the stupid thing was, the account that I was sending to, was a CBA account as well
