 They can close it, as you can when they want - they normally give 30 days notice.  The message on the machine suggests you card (and possibly account) have been closed.    Why don&amp;#039;t you move your paypal money into your new account, and sort it out without loosing any money?

About a month agho i got a letter from my new bank saying the switch is complete and if i wanted them to close my old account all i had to do was sign the bit of paper they provided and send it back to them. I DIDNT DO THAT!     I wanted to keep it open so i left it, a few weeks ago i got a letter from baerclays sayign that under blah blah terms of the banks agreement they can ask me for my money to clear the overdraft at any time (it was about 15 in the minus because of a failed direct debit which didnt transfer when i switched accounts) I just thought they was asking for this as i dont have an overdraft facility and they were just clearing up their accounts with the current economic state etc.     Today i went to a cash machine and checked my balance, to see if money i have transfered from paypal had cleared - When i typed in my pin code the machine said &amp;#039;Request rejected by your card provider&amp;#039; or something like that.     I havent had a letter from barclays to say my aco!!!! is closed, nor did i ask for it to be closed, can they close it without my permission?     What will happen to my paypal money.?!
