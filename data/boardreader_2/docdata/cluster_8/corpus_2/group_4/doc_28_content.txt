       gm and ford just had their european trade insurance pulled  so now should they wish to buy parts from europe, either the suppliers do so without insurance cover, or the car companies pay cold hard cash  let us see if the officialdom direct aig to step in with insurance, and tell fannie to enter the car financing biz  the situation will deteriorate further, especially when the municipalities and states go illiquid  we are accelerating towards zero state monetary reset  recommendation: buymoregold
