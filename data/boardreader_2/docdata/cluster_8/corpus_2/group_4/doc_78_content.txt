No it is not, it is stated in the terms of the contract between you and the bank, here is a simple analogy for you, your train is due at 16:00 from Edinburgh which your ticket is paid and booked for that particular train, but you choose to take an earlier train and get the 15:00 instead, you are able to board the train (i.e. use the overdraft facility) but you were not supposed to get on that train (outside of the contract, T&amp;amp;amp;C&amp;#039;s - et al) therefore when the ticket inspector comes around you have to pay an additional fee to use that service.
