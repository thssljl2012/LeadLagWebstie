I have had just over 800 of charges since then on my account from halifax, i wrote to them a few weeks ago to ask for it back and received a three page letter telling me all about the &amp;amp;quot;test case&amp;amp;quot; and that they will not be paying out as a result(plus the fact that i had previously had charges returned).     Any idea as to my next step?  Do i send the next letter threatening court action?  Will i actually be able to start court action?  Has anyone had recent success with halifax?     Any help would be very greatfull.  many thanks.                           I&amp;#039;m in the same position - Halifax told me that they&amp;#039;re putting everything on hold.... Where does this leave me? Do I send the court letter / go straight to court?!         If you&amp;#039;ve heard anything please advise!!!
