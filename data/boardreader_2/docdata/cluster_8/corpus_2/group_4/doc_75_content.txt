 I think Goldfish took over Morgan Stanley, and I think it is possible now that Barclays have eaten the Goldfish!        but I am not certain, I had a MS Card and then Goldfish took it over and I remember seeing some letter to do with Barclays telling me they had taken something of mine over but I could be mistaken! I didn&amp;#039;t really pay attention to it because it is just another creditor letter!       But normally they wouldn&amp;#039;t change your account number. So maybe try asking for a copy application from this company to check it is really meant to be on your credit file.
