 Just to let people know that Barclays had a vast amount of people apply for the Tax Haven ISA tax year 07/08. I was one of them. To cut a long story short Barclays could not cope with all these applications. They said my application was invalid because of missing application details , when there was nothing wrong with it.  I missed out on my investment for 07/08 and  made a  formal complaint .  Don&amp;#039;t be fobbed off by them.Keep chasing them with emails   Nine weeks later they have just sent me a cheque for 220 and an appology. Should I ask for more ?
