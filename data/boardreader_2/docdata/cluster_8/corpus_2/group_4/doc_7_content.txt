Any bank that you owe money to will have small print in your credit agreement which states it can collect any overdue payment from any monies you have in a current account or savings account or even a child&amp;#039;s account that you hold with them. So please be careful with this too, I don&amp;#039;t want you to lose any money this way. Open new accounts with banks that you don&amp;#039;t owe money to.     Halifax did this to me, I was trustee for my son&amp;#039;s savings account and they emptied it to pay some arrears I had. They gave me it back in full after I threatened newspapers and media publicity for their behaviour, especially on a child&amp;#039;s account. So be careful where you stash the money for your BR fees, you don&amp;#039;t want it swallowed up by greedy creditors!     Hope I have been of somehelp and do keep us posted!                        Hi Don, they gave you the money back because it is illegal to take money from someone else&amp;#039;s account.  If you had a joint account with your child that would be something different altogether but as you were only trustee - it wasn&amp;#039;t your account.  Halifax are known for that.  As for other banks they&amp;#039;re all just as bad as each other.  Good advice re opening account at bank you don&amp;#039;t owe money to and as the OP is thinking of bankruptcy they may as well open a bank account with either Barclays or Coop.  I prefer the coop account because it comes with an electron debit card - barclays only comes with a debit card.
