Altho I&amp;#039;m sure most high street banks the same.  We have overdraft with them which forms part of our dmp which is being organised by payplan - most of the other creditors (MBNA excepted) have behaved with decency - however, Barclays!!  The overdraft was run on a &amp;#039;reserve&amp;#039; basis, whereby you have your overdraft and they charge you a fixed fee if you go over it, into your reserve.  Which was fine when we were able to clear it, now we can&amp;#039;t they are merrily charging us 22 (the reserve fee) a couple of times a month, this is in addition to interest.  The debt will never be paid at this rate.  Now the really hilarious thing is that I was thinking about asking the financial ombudsman about the fairness of this when a letter arrived today from Barclays customer services thanking us for our complaint, referring to their previous letter where they promised to look into it, and saying (ever so politely) that I could refer to the financial ombudsman if I didn&amp;#039;t like their decision.  What a great idea!  Except that we have never complained, nor received a previous letter - what a***s - but they have given me a great idea ........  I&amp;#039;ll pass it onto payplan as per, but am minded to ask the ombudsman all the same about all these 22 payments they are helping themselves to.  So be warned!!
