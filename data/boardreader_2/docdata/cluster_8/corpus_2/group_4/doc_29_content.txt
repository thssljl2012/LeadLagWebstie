 Are you nuts, Willis 41..&amp;amp;quot;.The whole reason there hurting is because were afraid to go out and spend the cash&amp;amp;quot;  You are either really naive or stupid, I&amp;#039;ll nope for naive.          The American car companies have had many, years to change there strategies, and every-time they could have made that change and put out a better product, one that would entice us to buy it, they decided to go for the short term, easy profits.  This subject is very, very difficult, and I can see why it is for so many.  There are a great number of people that depend on the auto industry, both directly and in-directly for there income.  I would hate to see anything non-positive happen to an American based company.        The News has been all over this subject lately, and there are many very smart men out there that all seem to have a few good points to their arguments, of what should be done.  I am not smart enough nor informed enough (like the rest of those here, and abroad) to make any real statement one way or the other.  I understand most when they react in horror, to the thought of there beloved Big three going out of business, that&amp;#039;s expected.  But at what cost and at what point, do you say enough is enough??  The same three that want the public to bail them out today, are the same three that made great profits for years, and re-fussed to make the changes that would have secured there future.  GM, 25 years ago came up with a great little electric car, even with intentional design ques to make it look anything but like a car, it sold and sold well.  Of-coarse this electric car was only in response to the California Air and resource Boards, decision to hold automotive car makers liable , and require them to severely increase there EPA and MPG standards.  Gm for years complained that they could not build a electric car, that would function well enough that the American people would buy.  Well even with GM dragging there feet on the project, and with them doing everything possible to dis-courage it&amp;#039;s sales, they were proven wrong, the American people did buy them, and way more then GM would produce.  This put GM is a very unique spot, the car they said they couldn&amp;#039;t build, and the same one they claimed no-one would buy, was a hit.  So instead of using this model as a guide toward future cars, they instead paid large sums of money to have several key members of the board replaced, and re-seated with others, people that would over-turn that requirement for better cars, and allow GM and the rest of the car industry to go back to business as usual.  Once that happened, Gm quite quickly rounded up all there electric cars (they would only allow people to Lease them), and proceeded to smash each and every one, even with the owners begging them to allow them to buy the cars, instead of crushing them.          Fast forward twenty years, and everything is moving along as planed, gas is cheap and the big three are knee deep selling huge gas guzzlers, that yes they themselves ran add campaign&amp;#039;s to promote.  They had everyone thinking they were morons or just bad parents if you didn&amp;#039;t move your family around in these over-sized, gas sucking bathmats called SUV&amp;#039;s.  While all this was going on, did any of them stop to think about the planet, the future of even there own companies future?          Now, that we have gone thru a reality check, and gas prices have eclipsed the $4.00 mark, Now they are scratching there heads and wondering why know-one is buying there products.  Throw in a recession (which has really been brewing for a while) and you have the current picture of GM, Ford and Chrysler.        Yes, I agree those reports of $71.00/hour are outrageous, but don&amp;#039;t be so stupid as to think that&amp;#039;s what the factory worker is making .  Those figures are based on the workers salary, medical benefits, pension, and other entitlements...all of which don&amp;#039;t add up to the $71.00 figure you here.  Those figures are all of the above, PLUS the contractual agreements they agreed to in terms of retiree programs and a century of bad accounting and business practices.  Much like when the United States raided the Social Security Fund, the Automakers Raided there funds that were earmarked to take care of expenses by the retirees.  Sorry if you spent you money at one time, like a 6 year old in a candy shop....The Big Three like to flop that huge hourly figure around to make the rest of the country furious at the factory workers.  No they do not make 71/hour, nor should they, but they do have very nice hourly rates of around 21-28/hour with benefits.             I love the American cars and there workers as much as anyone, but I&amp;#039;m not willing to spend the Billions of dollars they want too rescue them.  I didn&amp;#039;t want to rescue the Air lines, Banks, Mortgage Companies, or the AIG insurance Company either......So according to my count, they will probably get what they want.  Personally, I do feel sorry for the laid off workers, but really what is the difference between an auto worker and an office worker, a factory worker or construction worker??  They have already experienced the joy of joblessness, so why should the Car workers be any different?  Citi bank just yesterday decided to lay off 52,000 workers, the days before that DHL let 10,000 go, before that the finance industry let over 300,000 go, and before that there were hundreds of thousand more.  I don&amp;#039;t play favorites....if it&amp;#039;s the time in our world for the Auto industry to leave, re-structure, down-size or combine with one another, then so be it.  But how can I justify the firing of a $8/hour retail worker, the $12/hour factory worker or $15/hour office worker when know one cares, but worry about some $22-28/hour auto worker.  I think not....I wish no one got there Pink slip, but it hurts the low wage earner just as much as the higher wage earner.           If America future is without an American Auto maker, then so be it, but i am not going to support the use of Public funds to keep the same old politics running.  There were some very good points about the big three taking the Chapter 11 route, go like the airlines had to, re-structure your companies, and make something worth buying.
