          Indeed we should all be very angry - this sounds not good at all for existung shareholder and I hope there will enough anger to vote it down - this must be subject to shareholder vote I guess   I would certainly hope so. The conditions seem amazingly favourable to the new shareholders and to anyone able to take up the convertibles.   Glas.
