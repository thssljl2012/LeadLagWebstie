Also, maybe someone knows the answer to this question.  What would have happened if AIG failed?  I mean... it&amp;#039;s just insurance right?  You cancel all existing policies without claims, process and finalize all active claims, turn off the lights and go home... right?  I know that&amp;#039;s simplifying it a lot but is it far from the truth?  It&amp;#039;s not like the properties or securities AIG was/is insuring is going to vaporize without the insurance... I mean if my home owners insurance cancels my policy I just go to another insurance company.  Maybe I&amp;#039;m daft and just don&amp;#039;t get it.
