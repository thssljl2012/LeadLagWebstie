 As FSCS have announced the start of icesave compensation process, I wonder what I should do with my ISA money in icesave. My money was subsribed in 07/08 with HSBC and then transfered to icesave just before it went down. I have subscribed 08/09 ISA with Barclays and I presume they don&amp;#039;t accept transfer in. Now, I need to open (not subscribe) a new ISA account to accept my icesave ISA money. I hope you all agree with my plan and here are the questions  :  1. Am I eligible to open a fix rate ISA? What is your recommendation?    2. What amount should I fill in the transfer in form? The total amount (3000+interest) or just 3000? I haven&amp;#039;t take out my interest.    Thanks all
