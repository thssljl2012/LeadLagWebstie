 Does anyone know if I can deposit cash into my Abbey account using an ATM. I haven&amp;#039;t used this account for several years and can&amp;#039;t remember (although I&amp;#039;m sure I used to do this). I tried on my Barclays account last week but their ATM&amp;#039;s don&amp;#039;t offer this facility.
