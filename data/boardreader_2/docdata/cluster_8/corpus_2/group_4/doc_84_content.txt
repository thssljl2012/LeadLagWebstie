  thanks to MSE user Foreversummer who posted this link on another thread.       http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008...gages-property       Woolwich Mortgage holders (Tracker) along with RBS and Abbey, are in a good position according to the article.           Quote:                         But it is better luck if you&amp;#039;re with Abbey, RBS or Woolwich. They all said this week that their tracker rates would go as low as the BoE base rates dared
