  Your direct debit amount will change automatically as far as I am aware. I have never had to change mine. The letter I receive normally says that the rate has dropped by ?% and therefore from XX date your payment wil be XYZ.00 per month.      I think you will only need to change if you have a standing order rather than a direct debit
