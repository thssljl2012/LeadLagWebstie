   Quote:                  The fact that I made a couple of payments years ago is irrelavent. If the CAB wrote to Barclays and said that basically I cannot afford it at the moment and they did this within 6 years from when I finished my course then I will be liable.          Correct.       Quote:                  However, if they wrote to Barclays after 6 years from me finishing my course then it is infact statute barred?          Yes.       Quote:                   Barclays have just told me I took out the CDL on 12th Sept 2003.                 Are you sure this is correct? It&amp;#039;s a lot later than you originally thought.       Quote:                   Can you please confirm what this means exactly.          The cause of action is the default (not to be confused with a default notice). The default would occur when a payment was due and no payment was made. So in this instance the cause of action would run from the month after the last payment was made.
