          Was the reason you opted for Barclays over Skipton due to the fees?  Skipton were stricter with their lending criteria (I also think they had a small fee 500), and I didn&amp;#039;t want to risk applying and then in a month being declined (I wasn&amp;#039;t 100% sure how they treated a bonus), and having to go back to the market when rates might well have moved.  HSBC, had also withdrawn the offer , during the week when I applied, although they reinstated it later.  Anyway, I played it safe, and if Skipton had still had their deal after I was with Barclays, then I could have changed, as there were/are no redemption fees.    You did well.  Skipton has a 3% base rate floor IIRC.  Am I righht in thinking that Barclays works on Barclays base rate? Which is usually the same as BoE base but not guaranteed to be?  Manks
