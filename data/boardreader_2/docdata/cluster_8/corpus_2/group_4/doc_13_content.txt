                                                          Obama&amp;#039;s               Change Leaves               By The Back Door                  By               Tom Eley                  07 November,               2008                 WSWS.org                   T   hree               days after Barack Obama&amp;#039;s election victory,   the initial moves by the               president-elect to prepare his administration already show that his               policies will be determined not by popular expectations, but by the               domestic and foreign policy interests of the American financial and               corporate elite.                  Obama and               Democratic congressional leaders are well aware that these policiesfurther               measures to secure the social interests and personal wealth of the               financial aristocracy at public expense and the continued use of military               violence in the Middle East and Central Asiaclash with the               will of the electorate, which sought to reverse these policies by               sweeping the Republicans out of power. That is why the Democrats are               seeking to dampen expectations of a serious change of course.                  The personnel               of Obama&amp;#039;s transition team and his first major appointment stand in               obvious contradiction to his campaign rhetoric about &amp;quot;change,&amp;quot;               &amp;quot;new politics,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;building a movement from the ground               up.&amp;quot; The individuals selected are all fixtures of the political               establishment, with close ties to powerful corporate and financial               interests.                  Obama&amp;#039;s               transition team, which will assist in assembling his cabinet, is headed               by  John Podesta, former chief of staff to Bill Clinton and one of               Washington&amp;#039;s most successful corporate lobbyists.  Co-chairing the               transition team are Valerie Jarrett, a long-time Obama advisor, Chicago               real estate executive and influential figure within the Chicago Democratic               Party machine, and Pete Rouse, a Washington insider and Obama&amp;#039;s senate               chief of staff. (See: &amp;quot;A closer look at Obama&amp;#039;s transition team&amp;quot;).                Obama&amp;#039;s               first appointee is    Rahm Emanuel ,   who will serve as his chief of staff.               The Illinois Congressman is a   leading member of the right-wing  Democratic               Leadership Council   . While running for Congress in 2002, he  supported               Bush&amp;#039;s bill to authorize military force against Iraq.  A former investment               banker, he has close ties to financial interests and is o ne of the               biggest recipients of campaign cash from banks and investment firms.                 Sources               close to Obama have leaked names on the list of candidates for the               position of treasury secretaryno doubt as a means of reassuring               Wall Street. Included are former Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul Volcker,                former Clinton treasury secretary and c urrent Citigroup executive               Robert Rubin,  another  former Clinton treasury secretary, Lawrence               Summers , and T imothy Geithner, the New York Federal Reserve Bank president.                  All of               these individuals played leading roles in the deregulation of the               banks and investment houses  that facilitated the super-profits and               massive CEO compensation packages of the 1990s and first half of the               current decade, and contributed to the financial collapse that is               now plunging the US and the rest of the world into the deepest recession               since the 1930s.                 Geithner               has played a central role in the government bailout of Wall Street               banks and other major firms , such as insurance conglomerate AIG and               the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.                As Federal               Reserve chief under Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan,  Volcker was responsible               for the high interest rate &amp;quot;shock therapy&amp;quot; which decimated               American industry in the early 1980s and led to the impoverishment               of entire regions.                 There is               much speculation that Obama will ask current Defense Secretary Robert               Gates to stay on in the same capacity, at least on an interim basis.               Gates recently gave a speech expanding the doctrine of &amp;quot;pre-emptive               war&amp;quot; to include the use of first-strike nuclear attacks.                Other names               broached for the positions of defense secretary and secretary of state               include former Bush Secretary of State Colin Powell, outgoing Republican               Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, and Anthony Lake, who as Clinton&amp;#039;s               national security advisor played a key role in organizing the US-NATO               war against Yugoslavia.                  Obama&amp;#039;s               actions since Election Day have been calculated to signal to the ruling               elite his readiness to defend their interests and not be swayed by               the will of the electorate. To underscore his intention to seek a               consensus with the defeated and discredited Republican minority, he               will meet on Monday with Bush.
