  You do make a very good point about AIG and trusting insurance companies in general. I didn&amp;#039;t see those NYTimes articles, but I am not surprised that insurance companies don&amp;#039;t want to pay.   But it is a fact that Medicare and Social Security are out of money, so I&amp;#039;m not counting on them being around in the future when I might need them.      LTC insurance may not be for everyone, and I wasn&amp;#039;t trying to push it on anyone. But it is legit (as much as any other legitimate insurance) and very affordable compared to the costs of nursing home care or home health care. Good luck.
