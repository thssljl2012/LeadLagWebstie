Is your card barclays connect?     Edit: Well Sign the card take it to your local branch and then ask whats wrong with it. They might have to stamp it or whatever, you got the exact same card as me - but I can&amp;#039;t remember what they did to myne.      But in the letter with the card it does ask for you to sign it. So before you go get it checked out, sign it.
