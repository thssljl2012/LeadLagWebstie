When i get approval for my new bank account should i then cancel all direct debits and switch only the ones i need which aint included in DMP?  when do i tell the bank i have switched accounts?     and finally, now that i have set up a DMP with cccs,do i continue to pay credit cards,loans etc..... untill i recieve my welcome pack or shall i just cancel direct debits and wait till my DMP is set up so i can get some money behind me.     many thanks for any help.............glad this forum is here to help people in the same boat out.                        If your car is on a Hire Purchase agreement, this should be listed in your main budget, as this would be classed as a priority, as there would be a repossession clause in the contract.         If Black Horse set you up on a standard personal loan, then this will be added to the list of creditors and they will receive a reduced pro rata figure the same of everyone else.         If your car is on HP you will need to set the DD up from your Barclays account, if it is a Personal loan there would be no need as this will be included in the list of creditors.         As long as your money is in your Barclays account, Lloyds would not have access.         When you receive your pack to go on your dmp, there will be a letter to forward on to your creditors explaining that you are going on a DMP, you could send a token payment with this as you will need to budget enough money for your first payment.
