So when I went to collect the draft,should it be Barclays that have debited the money from our account,at their exchange rate not the receiver general for Canada,what should i look for on my bank statement? sorry confused!                          Hi    Yes I believe the bank will have debited the money from your account straight away on their exchange rate, to draw up the draft.    When I collected the draft it had no reference to my name or account numbers at all, just Barclays Bank and the Canadian account the draft was being drawn from.
