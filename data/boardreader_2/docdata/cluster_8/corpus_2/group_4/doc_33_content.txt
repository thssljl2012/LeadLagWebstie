   They bail out AIG  - insurance - which produces nothing&amp;amp;amp; who, if they failed, would&amp;#039;ve cost a few thousand jobs. Insurance would still be needed so other companies would see their business increase and would hire many of those displaced workers. On the other hand, we let GM, Ford &amp;amp;amp; Chrysler fail- who produce an actual product- and leave Americans with the only option of buying a foreign car - and while some of those cars are produced in the U.S.,some are not, andthe majority of the profit goes back overseas. Some peopleare clueless to the fallout of this onmany levels. It isn&amp;#039;t just the Big 3 it would take down, but the dealers, the parts producers, the truck drivers who haul cars&amp;amp;amp; parts, etc. In addition, you have retirees who will lose half their pension. Regardless of what  you think  they should or shouldn&amp;#039;t get, they&amp;#039;ve made financial choices based on what their pension is supposed to be so it means more foreclosures and less purchasing by these people in addition to the newly unemployed which then effects restaurants, stores, and service&amp;amp;amp; health care industry jobs. You wouldn&amp;#039;t doubt that if you&amp;#039;d ever worked in an auto industry town when there were even rumors of a strike. Think about it-your income suddenly gets cut in half and your insurance eliminated-how would you be doing? You wouldn&amp;#039;t be buying clothes or eating out. You&amp;#039;d be waiting as long as possible to get your hair cut, etc. You&amp;#039;d make do with glasses you have until they break or youjust couldn&amp;#039;t see- same with the dentist - no regular check-ups, just go if you&amp;#039;re in pain.      Do unions need to make concessions-  yes .   But   you can&amp;#039;t blame them for not wanting to when management isn&amp;#039;t willing to make any. None of the Big 3 bosses went to Washington on a commercial flight or offered to not take a salary or bonus until the company was turned around like Iacocca. Clearly the leadership isn&amp;#039;t getting it.It&amp;#039;s like Delphi paying out huge bonuses to top execs right beforefiling bankruptcy.       They bail out banks.  How&amp;#039;s that working?Here&amp;#039;s my experience - We built a house several years ago based on my husband&amp;#039;s salaryat Delphi and the amount of time he intended to work until retirement. We went a little over budget but since I work also, that wasn&amp;#039;t abig deal. I&amp;#039;d just work afew more years. Fast forward 5 years and we learn that Delphi is closing our plant along with others- we have about6 months of rumorson what will happen to people, and possible options, before finding out about 3-4 months before the plant shut down that no transferswere available and no decision had been made about retirements. (he had 28 yrs.&amp;amp;amp; 9 mos. of service). We ended up more fortunate than many people&amp;amp;amp; were bridged to retirement- even so, it meant a huge pay cut the first year and that income will be cut in half yet again this year. This as our house value has decreased with the market and our local housing market is flooded with houses- few of which are selling. All this to say, when we tried to contact our mortgage holder (who received some of that bailout money)about renegotiatingour interest rate&amp;amp;amp; work something out to pay them, they aren&amp;#039;t interested in talking to us until we&amp;#039;re3 months behind and in foreclosure- so apparently they want us to not pay them! That kind of logic could explain why the banks need bailed out.      There is no easy answer here. Just pumping more money into any of these situations won&amp;#039;t solve the problem.  But,  the problem needs to be solved. Whether we like it or not, with the auto industry, part of the consideration here should also be the fact that we have already literally leveled numerous manufacturing plants across the county - the same plants that were converted to build military vehicles in the past. Ifwe areagain attacked here and need to quickly build up our military, are we comfortable relying on Japan, Korea or Germany for that?
