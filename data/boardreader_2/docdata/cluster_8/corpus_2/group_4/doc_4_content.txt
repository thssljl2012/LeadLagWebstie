 Hi,    Im hoping you guys can help.  Im posting this on behalf of my brother who has just received a letter from a DCA (Red debt collection services) demanding money for a dept given to them by Barclays.  Just to give a little back ground info.  My brother had an account with Barclays a few years ago, he didnt use the account very much but he became overdrawn after not honoring a DD.  At this point the bank started to charge him penalty fees for being overdrawn and continued to do this for approx 18 months after which they finally closed the account.  Barclays dept management started sending letter and then telephone calls demanding the money be paid back.  He told them he would not pay them any money as the debt was a result of illegal bank charges.  The bank has now passed this debt on to a DCA (red debt collection service)      What is the best way to respond to the letter from the DCA?  Should he write a letter and if so is there a template on here that he can use?  Should he call them or just ignore it?        Thanks    Aki
