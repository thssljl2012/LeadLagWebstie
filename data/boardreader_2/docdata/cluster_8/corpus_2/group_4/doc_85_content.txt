  We have a lifetime BoE Base Tracker offset Woolwich mortgage too.  Just surrendered 2 unit linked endowments - luckily got in before latest round of FTSE drops.  When money comes thru&amp;#039; we&amp;#039;re gonna pull out all the stops &amp;amp;amp; pay off mortgage completely.  TYPICAL - as soon as we make /can make that decision - rates drop.......  Still at least we won&amp;#039;t have savings getting c*** rates.  Pros &amp;amp;amp; Cons....Swings &amp;amp;amp; Roundabouts
