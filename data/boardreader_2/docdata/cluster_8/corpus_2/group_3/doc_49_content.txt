    I tend to agree with Matt Taibbi in New York magazine, talking to conservative Byron York about Fannie/Freddie:  &amp;quot;Oh, come on. Tell me you&amp;#039;re not ashamed to put this gigantic international financial Krakatoa at the feet of a bunch of poor black people who missed their mortgage payments. The CDS market, this market for credit default swaps that was created in 2000 by Phil Gramm&amp;#039;s Commodities Future Modernization Act, this is now a $62 trillion market, up from $900 billion in 2000. That&amp;#039;s like five times the size of the holdings in the NYSE. And it&amp;#039;s all speculation by Wall Street traders. It&amp;#039;s a classic bubble/Ponzi scheme. The effort of people like you to pin this whole thing on minorities, when in fact this whole thing has been caused by greedy traders dealing in unregulated markets, is despicable... These massive companies aren&amp;#039;t going under because of individual homeowner defaults. They&amp;#039;re going under because of the myriad derivatives trades that go on in connection with each piece of debt, whether it be a homeowner loan or a corporate bond. I&amp;#039;m still waiting to hear what your idea is of how these trades work. I&amp;#039;m guessing you&amp;#039;ve never even heard of them.&amp;quot;   CDS are perfectly fine. Its insurance on your investments. The CDS on MBS were rated AAA by ratings firms, which are heavily regulated by the Government. In fact, the government allows only 3 firms to rate, S&amp;amp;amp;P, Fitch and Moody&amp;#039;s. If Government allowed competition, you would get much better forecast and ratings.   In this case, they over regulated.  EPIC FAIL    Wait, you&amp;#039;re blaming the government for S&amp;amp;amp;P, Fitch and Moody&amp;#039;s? More competition in rating agencies? That&amp;#039;s laughable. Because the rating agencies bought the swill sold by those dealing in unregulated markets, doesn&amp;#039;t mean if there were more ratings agencies, we would be warned. You&amp;#039;re smarter than that. Look, nobody was supposed to care about the CDS because they were mostly the province of hedge funds. Since hedges are dealing with rich people&amp;#039;s money, they&amp;#039;re supposed to be able to bear the risk. Unfortunately, the risk collapsed and bled into the mainstream economy. You seem to view the problem as a bottom to top problem. I view it as a top to bottom problem. The top has more power to spread risk that backfiresto other parts of the economy.  No, it isn&amp;#039;t laughable and NYS Insurance regulators are talking about this right now after the AIG situation where all these firms were buying and insuring Aaa rated security pools.  The rating agencies were corrupt or incompetent and they are under investigation. One of the main reasons was no competition, no fear of doing a bad job because no one could compete.
