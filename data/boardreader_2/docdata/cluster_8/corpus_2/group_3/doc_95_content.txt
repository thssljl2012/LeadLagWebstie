I opened 2 Barclays basic bank accounts when bankrupt, one joint with OH who was also bankrupt and the other account is just in my name.  Are you sure it was a basic account you tried to open?  They do not do them in branch, you have to fill a form in and send it away with ID and it takes about 2 weeks to set up.  We were not on the electrol register as we had &amp;amp;quot;done a runner&amp;amp;quot; and not told anyone our new address and we had no problems opening the accounts     If I were you I would ask Barclays again and get the form filled in ASAP and sent off, it sounds as though they tried to give you a &amp;amp;quot;normal&amp;amp;quot; account
