                                         It&amp;#039;s been discussed to death here (althought it didn&amp;#039;t start that way):      http://jjb.yuku.com/topic...-for-the-Republicans.html      I believe majority people here think that it is a right and to think otherwise is either ignorant or stupid.     I think healthcare is a responsibility. You have the right to pursue to be healthy. Government should strive to make health care affordable. But it&amp;#039;s definitely not a right. I stand by our founding fathers: right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.     Why I don&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;s a right:     1. People treat their body differently   2. People have different life style and living habits   3. Health care is extremely costly now. To make this as a right and mandating insurance to cover everyone without raising premium is almost sending these companies out of business.  If government ends up taking over the whole health care, then we will be soon become a socialist/communist country and we will lose edge as one of the leader in healthcare or research.      Just think of AIG or car insurance. If car insurance is forced to take everyone with all kind of driving records and risks, and the government mandate them to keep the premium low. they will be toast.
