  The government bails out Bear Sterns, takes over AIG the largest insurance company in the US, takes over Fanimae and Freddie Mac the largest home lenders in the nation and then say&amp;#039;s we aren&amp;#039;t going to help distressed homeowners nor their communities.         Now how screwed up is that?      And all because of deregulation and shark business practices.
