    JohnGalt:      Rich:  That&amp;#039;s the problem when you have a completely unregulated CDS market championed by Phil Gramm.   Gramm isn&amp;#039;t responsible for poor calculations of VAR of which  EVERYONE  calculated wrong. You could have seen this crisis coming from a mile away but poor VAR calculations can kill you. Don&amp;#039;t you remember all those businesses saying they had enough capital yet they still collapsed, that was due to poor VAR calculations using biased statistics.   &amp;quot;If there was no CDS market, there would not have been a subprime market because the banks going pass the risks to other people and companies.&amp;quot; CDS isn&amp;#039;t the problem because hedging is a good thing. Your argument is specious at best, I could say if there was no market we wouldn&amp;#039;t have had a problem either. If there was no push to give homes to those who couldn&amp;#039;t afford homes there wouldn&amp;#039;t have been a problem. The most of the blame should be on the credit industry because a AAA rating means that default is about once in 100 years which means companies like AIG were more than happy to take on more insurance because if rated correctly they would have made tons of money.    Yep credit rating needs a serious look at.
