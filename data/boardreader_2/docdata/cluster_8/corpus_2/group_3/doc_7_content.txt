If he gives me $5000 to go out and buy health insurance, do I get that same credit next year or am I on my own? And that does NOTHING to regulate the astronomical insurance costs. What I got from Obama was more regulatory on the insurance companies themselves.. was that correct? I almost took that as (again, very simplistic!) McCain would give me a $5000 gift card to Aetna Insurance, but Aetna would still be able to charge whatever they want for health care... but Obama would try to ensure that Aetna lowers their premiums enough that we don&amp;#039;t need that gift card to buy insurance for our families. Am I in the ballpark or way off?   Thanks for any help on that one or any of the above! As I said, I&amp;#039;m new to this but want to learn.    On a side note, the &amp;#039;other one&amp;#039; comment tweaked me off to no end.   Dave and I were also trying to count how many &amp;amp;quot;My Friends....&amp;amp;quot; we heard out of McCain as well and lost count somewhere around 43...                          First there were several people who became intoxicated with the &amp;amp;quot;my friends&amp;amp;quot; drinking game.     As to McCain&amp;#039;s proposal it is very bad for a number of different reasons.    It taxes the value of your corporate health plan as income -- it then provides a tax credit. The credit is inadequate to buy a family insurance plan (currently average corporate plans are valued at approximately $12,000 per worker).    Because corporate health benefits will become more expensive, workers will opt out -- especially younger healthier workers and the cost to employers will increase. Most health economists have predicted that this will result in a decline in the number of people who receive corporate health benefits -- and result in more expensive plans with less benefits for people as they are forced to obtain health insurance on the private market.    McCain also wants to &amp;amp;quot;deregulated&amp;amp;quot; health insurance -- his exact quote which came out just as the market melted was as follows:       Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation .    The problem with doing this (among many) is that health insurers would flee to those states offering the LEAST protection to the insureds.    What Obama proposes (in brief) is the ability for individuals and small businesses to buy into group health plans such as the one that the US government offers to its OWN employees like Senator McCain.   For anyone who has the misfortune to try to obtain private health insurance, the ability to be in a group would be an enormous benefit -- even at fair market value.    I believe that KAnne posted an url in which the plans (Obama and McCain) were compared point to point.    ETA -- I am cheered by your ability to discern the false patriotism as if those who are against the war in Iraq are against the troops who are valiantly serving there - some for extended tours because the government has chosen not to fund the government properly. I was involved in the anti Vietnam movement and one of my most moving experiences was a march in Washington in which we wore the name of a soldier who had died in Vietnam and then laid it in front of the White House in a large coffin.
