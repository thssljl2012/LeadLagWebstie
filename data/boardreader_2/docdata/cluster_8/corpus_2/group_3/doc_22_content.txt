     Fred, maybe she means the Alaska Senate.  Hard to say.  Technically, the VP is President of the Senate, as we know and she should be allowed to watch as many sessions as her heart&amp;#039;s desire.  If she becomes VP she can even sit up front as long as she&amp;#039;s quiet.  Not likely.  Dick Cheney would have already remodeled the Senate had he had any power there.  Ah!  The campaigns!  In full swing and the faithful of both parties are spouting party lines and deluding themselves into thinking how all their problems will disappear if their wonderful guy gets elected.  I love watching otherwise reasonable people buying into a marketing blitz.  One more things, since you asked.     Credit Default Swaps, now famous, were an arcane and and rather rarely used instrument until the Clinton adminstration lobbied to remove restrictions on lending practice by Fannie and Freddie.  This loosening of the income requirements on loans purchased led to Fannie and Freddie guaranteeing home loans to individuals with little capability to repay.  Lenders thought they couldn&amp;#039;t lose.  Fannie and Freddie packaged the mortgages into securities sold world-wide.   Credit default swaps were sold as insurance against defaults of those securities by AIG, Lehman etc, but were deliberately called swaps so they wouldn&amp;#039;t be subject to reserve regulations required of insurers.  So, blame Bush all you want for this, but the crisis had its beginning with the Clinton administration which by action assured the impotence of future administrations.
