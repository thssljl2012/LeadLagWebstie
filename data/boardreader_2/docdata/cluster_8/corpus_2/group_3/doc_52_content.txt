           Quoting  ADXMatt  ( Reply 28 ):  What are you talking about? If you are paying as agreed and have the proper insurance etc. they can&amp;#039;t call your loan. That is crazy.       Read the fine print on any mortgage. The issue I am highlighting is that mortgages are traded between banks and other financial institutions because they have value, the bank you took it out with could end up being the facilitator, collecting on behalf of another. The institution in trouble does not have to be your bank, but the one who purchased the mortgage, if they need funds they have to liquidate assets, and mortgages are financial assets. AIG is an insurance company, they had liquidity problems, they were looking to sell assets and could not find buyers, all their loans were not toxic, but does a buyer really care, use them to lower the price of the good ones.
