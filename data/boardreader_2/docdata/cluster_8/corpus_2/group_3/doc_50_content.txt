I&amp;#039;ve not heard much said about the regulation of Insurance Companies. You would think that after AIG bombed, and totally abdicated their resonsibility, to properly insure mortgages, that someone(how about a candidate)would be looking at the humongous Health Insurance &amp;#039;World&amp;#039;. Ppl think the health &amp;#039;care&amp;#039; is the expensive stuff. That&amp;#039;s only part of it. As far as the Doctors being the ones to feel sorry for..I&amp;#039;m not there yet. I live in Michigan..we have a place in Grand Rapids, that&amp;#039;s being referred to as the Medical Mile...it&amp;#039;s huge,,and growing. There&amp;#039;s imbalance somewhere, and before the govt just starts &amp;#039;paying&amp;#039; for everyone&amp;#039;s health insurance..there has to be overhaul. We&amp;#039;d be better off starting with tax &amp;#039;deductions&amp;#039;, to start with..while an overhaul takes place. There&amp;#039;s so much waste in the medical world, it&amp;#039;s pathetic. Govt running our healthcare, is something I do NOT want to jump into. Heck, at this point, if they can keep dumping BILLIONS of dollars into bailing ppl..we could all be paying our premiums..or why don&amp;#039;t they just pay the premiums through all employers? There&amp;#039;s options..I&amp;#039;ve talked with ppl in Canada, who say the Healthcare sucks..it&amp;#039;s all in who you talk to. Nothing will be perfect. I think some things are going to have to be moved to the state level. Too much FED in our lives is NOT a good thing. They aren&amp;#039;t our parents. They have some basic responsibilities to us. I have never viewed them, though, as having to take care of every little thing or to micro manage. I worry about that.
