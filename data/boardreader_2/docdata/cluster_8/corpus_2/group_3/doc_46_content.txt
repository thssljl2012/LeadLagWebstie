           You really can not explain the problem until you deal with swaps. They were an insurance on the mortgage paper instruments that were created. 60 minutes says that estimates are that 60 trillion dollars may be wrapped up in them. They are very complex and run to a couple hundred pages in the contracts. They are called swaps because insurance actually has some regulation and oversight. AIG and the other swap dealers lobbied hard to keep the government away. The swap concepts are so complex that they were designed by physicists and mathematicians. In theory they could not lose. They had no transparency and nobody knows for sure who has them and how much money is involved. 600 million dollars wont dent that problem.
