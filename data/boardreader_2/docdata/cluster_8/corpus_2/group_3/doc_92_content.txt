  I opened a 2007/2008 Cash Beater ISA in April 2007, then in February 2008 I got a letter telling me my account was being closed because the cheque used to fund the account was somebody elses, and that my cheque had been sent back to me.     I then had to get my current account provider to send me a copy of my cheque to prove Barclays cashed it.     It took almost til the end of the financial year to sort, but luckily they never closed the ISA and so I retained my allowance and immediately transferred out - Barclays appear poor at dealing with paperwork.     They made an adjustment to account for interest in the period they took the 3000 out of my account until they put it back.
