I can&amp;#039;t believe nobody has posted this yet.  Look at who could be a heartbeat away from the Oval Office   http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/wash...biden-fdr.html            Quote:                         Palin has blundered badly several times in the past several days, often on issues relating to the economy.    She&amp;#039;s been caught contradicting her running mate, which is among every political ticket&amp;#039;s Ten Commandments of no-no&amp;#039;s.    And on one occasion, she got her facts wrong. With voters closely watching and worrying about the financial crisis, these inconsistencies could have real consequences come Nov. 4, now less than six weeks away.    And they distract badly from the message the McCain campaign is trying to push on Barack Obama (namely, that the Illinois Senator is out of touch on the economy).    Palin made one mistake last week, when NBC&amp;#039;s Meredith Vieira asked her whether the federal government should bail out ailing insurance corporation AIG.  Palin said no , the same position Barack Obama took.     That would have been fine, except for the little fact that McCain had already endorsed the bailout , saying that he would not &amp;quot;second-guess&amp;quot; the government&amp;#039;s attempt to save AIG. This morning, &amp;quot;Today&amp;#039;s&amp;quot; Matt Lauer called McCain out on the contradiction. McCain patiently but firmly suggested Palin should have waited to respond.    And last night, in an interview with &amp;amp;#8220;CBS Evening News,&amp;amp;#8221; Palin misspoke when she told anchor Katie Couric that today&amp;#039;s leaders should take a lesson from the history books and follow former President Franklin D. Roosevelt&amp;#039;s response to a previous national financial crisis.    Declared Palin:  &amp;amp;#8220;When the stock market crashed, Franklin D. Roosevelt got on the television and didn&amp;#039;t just talk about the, you know, the princes of greed. He said, &amp;#039;Look, here&amp;#039;s what happened.&amp;#039;&amp;amp;#8221;     What&amp;#039;s wrong with that, some might ask?     Well, for starters Republican Herbert Hoover was president when the stock market crashed in October 1929. Second, Roosevelt didn&amp;#039;t take office until four years later. And, not to be picky, but there were also no televisions in use at the time. Radio was Roosevelt&amp;#039;s favored medium.     Palin has made non-economic goofs as well. In last night&amp;#039;s interview with Couric, she called one of her own campaign&amp;#039;s TV ads &amp;quot;terrible.&amp;quot;    &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#039;t know we did it and if I had anything to do with it, we would have never done it,&amp;quot; she said, referring to a commercial that mocked Obama for being elitist.    That kind of honesty might hurt Palin, but it also has the potential to help. As our colleague Faye Fiore points out in her excellent profile of Palin, published in Tuesday&amp;#039;s print editions of The Times, the governor&amp;#039;s off-the-cuff demeanor is also part of her appeal. Hmm, &amp;quot;straight talk,&amp;quot; where have we heard that before?    Fiore spent several days last week on the campaign trail with Palin, and the headline of her story speaks volumes about the character of the candidate:    &amp;quot;In-your-face time with Sarah Palin&amp;quot;    -- Kate Linthicum
