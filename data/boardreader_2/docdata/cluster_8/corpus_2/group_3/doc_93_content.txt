  Thanks for the speedy response but my Mother only stopped the cheque after she was specifically told to by Barclays themselves.  She did apply before the tax year and has the correspondence to show that the account was in fact opened however due to their internal communication problems they then closed it when they tried to cash the first cheque but it was returned uncashed (due to being stopped on their suggestion!!!!)!  So, we did everything that was asked but their own admin problems have caused the problems.     They are saying that the account was closed and can&amp;#039;t be re-opened.       Any other ideas???
