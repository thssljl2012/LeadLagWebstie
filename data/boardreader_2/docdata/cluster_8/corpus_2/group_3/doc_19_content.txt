AIG&amp;#039;s problems have come from two areas: 1) Sub-prime mortgages - both the lending and the insuring; and 2) Investments made backing up sub-prime portfolios and other risk investment vehicles such as credit-swaps.   In the first case, AIG&amp;#039;s mortgage operations (like so many others) loaned money to people who didn&amp;#039;t deserve it. I&amp;#039;m all for helping people buy the American Dream home, but risk is risk and poor credit ratings deserve to be handled differently. My own credit rating took a hard hit after my last 2 year stint at unemployment and I was still getting approached by banks to finance an entire house including the down payment on a low monthly mortgage with an adjustable rate. People sucked up the credit, bought bigger homes than they needed or could have otherwise afforded and when the recession hit, the dollar dropped, the real estate market tanked, and those &amp;amp;quot;adjustable&amp;amp;quot; rates started going skywards - no one could afford the mortgage anymore. So people defaulted, homes got foreclosed, banks took a lot of property and were stuck with it! Mortgages that were insured caused big payouts for those insurers. The financial services market is responsible for its own undoing because they gave out a lot of cheap credit.    In the second case, I&amp;#039;m not about to give anyone a lesson in Credit Defaults Swaps! You can read the fancy Wikipedia definition   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap     I like the way this site explains it   http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/ ... nanci.html     The bit about..... &amp;amp;quot;like a homeowners policy that insures against a flood or fire, these instruments are intended to cover losses to banks and bondholders when companies fail to pay their debts.&amp;amp;quot; is about as basic as it gets. AIG FP wrote a great deal of this crap in the financial services area. As more and more financial institutions got into trouble these swaps were paying out huge losses.    The segments at AIG that bear most of the responsibilities were about 10% of our revenues, BUT they took risks that were huge and resulted in a liquidity problem -- immediate obligations for which AIG&amp;#039;s corporate parent did not have the available cash to pay off --- if you can&amp;#039;t pay, you are bankrupt. Keep in mind that the &amp;amp;quot;insurance&amp;amp;quot; operations are under state regulation (NY being the lead regulator) - those monies can&amp;#039;t be touched outside of insurance. The Financial Services side (specifically Capital Markets and certain parts of Investments) are federally regulated and have to stand on their own with a different set of rules. Think of it like this.....your Grandfather has a nice fat trust waiting for you as an inheritance -- you can&amp;#039;t touch it till the old guy is gone, or until your 21 or for whatever other conditions. Meanwhile you&amp;#039;ve racked up a ton of debt gambling, overspending, etc. and you have a short period of time (like NOW!) to pay or else the loan shark, government, bank or whomever will have your head mounted on a pole. Unless you can find some cash fast you&amp;#039;re watching the world from the top of a broomstick!    When it comes to loan sharks, no one is better at the game than the Feds.  The &amp;amp;quot;deal&amp;amp;quot; we struck is not only a very dangerous precedent - it reeks of extortion. Now the Fed owns 79.90% of the company and the shareholders got screwed. (It had to be less than 80% otherwise AIG&amp;#039;s losses go on the Fed&amp;#039;s balance sheets). AIG has apparently already tapped $ 61 Billion of the $ 85 Billion and we are paying over 8+% interest on what&amp;#039;s been borrowed and another two+ points on what is still available.    Many of you may have seen or read the testimony given at the Congressional hearings. The story about the big soiree in the California spa resort is not what it seems. There were only 10 AIG American General employees there and it was for the biggest producers on the life side of the business. All the major life insurers have these big incentive awards and events. Some of those Congressmen have probably attended a few themselves. $ 400,000 was spent on a group of people who each brought in at least a $ 1 million in revenue. That&amp;#039;s not a bad rate on return.   The bit about the executive compensation and the continued payments to the clown singularly responsible for the bleeding is a different story. That bastard is in London and I added a link at the end about him. Paying that shyster a $ 1 million a month as a &amp;amp;quot;consultant&amp;amp;quot; after all the trouble he caused was ludicrous.  There was no excuse for any of this to have happened going several years back - but I won&amp;#039;t bore you about &amp;amp;quot;business&amp;amp;quot; details unless you&amp;#039;re buying the rounds at one of my favorite watering holes.   For me personally, I am busy as hell. As it turns out AIG is keeping all of our major clients in the domestic and international commercial property-casualty insurance business as well as a major stake in our foreign life insurance operations. I&amp;#039;ll lose four clients who will be runoff or sold. AIG is selling its domestic life and retirement operations, all personal lines (except for our high net worth book), it&amp;#039;s mortgage insurer, all financial services and some parts of asset management. We need to raise cash to pay off the debt - simple as that - and if it&amp;#039;s not a &amp;amp;quot;fire&amp;amp;quot; sale, well call it &amp;amp;quot;propane purchasing&amp;amp;quot; because the meaty parts won&amp;#039;t stay long enough to be well-done.   Our clients continue to need training - whether to help retain talent or help diversify talent for redeployment. Unfortunately, this means more webcasting and online work and less classroom time and travel. In fact, my grand tour of Europe (Budapest, Dublin and Paris) was canceled for next month.     However, it looks like Dubai may be in the works. [Better get my Laurence of Arabia act together].   I am okay, busy - a bit crazy in fact - and keeping my head above water. Everyday is rather surrealistic and I must add it sometimes feels like a sort of iconoclastic nightmare since I would never have believed two weeks ago that any of this was possible. But then who ever imagined September 11?? Interestingly, I went back to see the predictions for 2008 made on New Year&amp;#039;s Eve on the Coast to Coast AM Radio show. One trendcaster Gerald Celente predicted: 2008 will bring an &amp;amp;quot;economic 9-11&amp;amp;quot; in which big financial firms are going to collapse from the top down.    I understand why AIG had to be saved - the impact on the global economy would have been of apocalyptic proportions. Still all these bailouts smack of socialism. As Winston Churchill once said, &amp;amp;quot; The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries. &amp;amp;quot;  I&amp;#039;m afraid we have a while to go enduring misery    An interesting perspective from the inside.   WSJ reported today that Lehman going under will trigger $400 billion in payouts through credit default swaps.  I wonder what portion of that was covered by AIG.  As usual, Mauldin&amp;#039;s letter is very interesting this week.  http://www.frontlinethoughts.com/pdf/mwo101008.pdf   This week he gets into a scary and very obvious area we haven&amp;#039;t even talked about yet: defaults in construction lending.
