 Things aren&amp;#039;t always the way that they are presented to you.      Lies from the McCain/Palin camp:       http://wire.factcheck.org/page/2/        Tax Distortions    Palin repeated several false claims about Obama&amp;amp;#8217;s tax policies.      Obama did not in fact vote to increase taxes on &amp;amp;#8220;families&amp;amp;#8221; making as little as $42,000 per year. What Obama actually voted for was a budget resolution that called for returning the 25 percent tax bracket to its pre-Bush tax cut level of 28 percent. That could have affected an individual with no children making as little as $42,000. But a couple would have had to earn $83,000 to be affected and a family of four at least $90,000.      Palin also repeated the exaggeration that Obama voted 94 times to increase taxes. That number includes seven votes that would have lowered some taxes, 23 that were against tax cuts, and 17 that came on just seven different bills.      And finally, it&amp;amp;#8217;s false that Biden and Obama voted for &amp;amp;#8220;the largest tax increase in history.&amp;amp;#8221; Palin is referring here to the Democrats&amp;amp;#8217; 2008 budget proposal, which would indeed have resulted in about $217 billion in higher taxes over two years. That&amp;amp;#8217;s a significant increase. But measured as a percentage of GDP, the yardstick that most economists prefer, the 2008 budget proposal would have been the third-largest since 1968, and it&amp;amp;#8217;s not even in the top 10 since 1940.

McCain isn&amp;amp;#8217;t proposing a special tax break for oil companies, despite Joe Biden&amp;amp;#8217;s mention (more than once) of the $4 billion cut they&amp;amp;#8217;d get. As we&amp;amp;#8217;ve noted previously, McCain&amp;amp;#8217;s plan would cut the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25 percent &amp;amp;#8212; for ALL corporations, not just oil companies. It also would allow for immediate write-offs for companies buying new equipment and technology, and a tax credit of 10 percent of the amount companies spend on wages devoted to research and development.      A Democratic think-tank, the Center for American Progress, did its own calculations last March, figuring that would work out to a tax cut of $3.8 billion per year to the five largest U.S.-based oil companies, Exxon/Mobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Valero Energy and Marathon (based on 2007 earnings and tax figures &amp;amp;#8212; now it would likely be more.) Bottom line, though, is that none of the above provisions would apply to oil companies only.

Palin said that Obama&amp;amp;#8217;s plan would be &amp;amp;#8220;government run&amp;amp;#8221; and would mandate health care. The first claim is false, as we&amp;amp;#8217;ve said before. Obama&amp;amp;#8217;s plan would increase the offerings of publicly funded health care, but would not replace or remove private insurance, or require people to enroll in a public plan.      The second claim leaves out important information. Obama&amp;amp;#8217;s plan would mandate health coverage for children, but not for adults.

Biden said that McCain wrote in a magazine article that he wanted to do for the health care industry what deregulation had done for Wall Street. That&amp;amp;#8217;s taking McCain&amp;amp;#8217;s words out of context, as we&amp;amp;#8217;ve written before.      Biden is referring to a phrase from a journal article under McCain&amp;amp;#8217;s name that said he would reduce regulation of health insurance &amp;amp;#8220;as we have done over the last decade in banking.&amp;amp;#8221; But the full context shows McCain was talking specifically about a proposal to allow the sale and purchase of health insurance across state lines. Here&amp;amp;#8217;s the fuller quote:      McCain: I would also allow individuals to choose to purchase health insurance across state lines, when they can find more affordable and attractive products elsewhere that they prefer. Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.

Sarah Palin says that McCain sounded the alarm on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac two years ago. Our colleagues at PolitiFact questioned that claim, calling it &amp;amp;#8220;barely true.&amp;amp;#8221; Palin&amp;amp;#8217;s referring to a bill that would have increased oversight on Fannie and Freddie. McCain signed onto that bill as a cosponsor, but PolitiFact says it wouldn&amp;amp;#8217;t have lessened the current economic crisis. And in our recent article about assigning blame for the economic crisis, we add that by the time McCain added his name to the bill, the crisis was well underway. Home prices began falling only two months later.       Troop Levels Off    Palin got her numbers wrong on troop levels when she said that troops were now down to &amp;amp;#8220;pre-surge&amp;amp;#8221; levels. The surge was announced in January 2007, at which point there were 132,000 troops in Iraq according to the Brookings Institute Iraq Index. As of September 2008, that number was 146,000. President Bush recently announced that another 8,000 would be coming home by February of next year. But that would still be 6,000 more than when the surge began.

Obama did say that troops in Afghanistan were killing civilians, a claim that Palin calls &amp;amp;#8220;untrue.&amp;amp;#8221; Here&amp;amp;#8217;s the whole quote, from a campaign stop in New Hampshire:      Obama, August 2007: We&amp;amp;#8217;ve got to get the job done there and that requires us to have enough troops so that we&amp;amp;#8217;re not just air-raiding villages and killing civilians, which is causing enormous problems there.      The Associated Press fact-checked this one, and found that in fact U.S troops were killing more civilians at the time than insurgents: &amp;amp;#8220;As of Aug. 1, the AP count shows that while militants killed 231 civilians in attacks in 2007, Western forces killed 286. Another 20 were killed in crossfire that can&amp;amp;#8217;t be attributed to one party.&amp;amp;#8221; Afghan president Hamid Karzai had expressed concern about these civilian killings, a concern President Bush said he shared.      Posted under FactCheck.org       This post was written by Jess Henig on October 2, 2008             2005 Energy Bill Deja Vu    Palin threw out an old canard when she criticized Obama for voting for the 2005 Energy bill, saying, &amp;amp;#8220;that&amp;amp;#8217;s what gave those oil companies those big tax breaks.&amp;amp;#8221;   It&amp;amp;#8217;s a false attack Clinton used against Obama in the primary and McCain himself has hurled. It&amp;amp;#8217;s true that the bill gave some tax breaks to oil companies, but it also took away others. And according to the Congressional Research Service, the bill created a slight net increase in taxes for the oil industry.      Posted under Barack Obama, FactCheck.org       This post was written by Justin Bank on October 2, 2008             The Iraqi Surplus    Biden said that Iraq had an &amp;amp;#8220;$80 billion surplus.&amp;amp;#8221; Obama said the same &amp;amp;#8212; $79 billion &amp;amp;#8212; in the last debate, and we called him on it then. Seventy-nine billion is an out-of-date projection. The Iraqis currently have $29 billion in the bank, and could have $47 billion to $59 billion by the end of the year.      Posted under FactCheck.org       This post was written by Jess Henig on October 2, 2008             Obama Voted Against Troop Funding?    Palin repeated the claim that Obama &amp;amp;#8220;voted against funding our troops.&amp;amp;#8221; The claim refers to a single 2007 vote against a war funding bill. Obama voted for a version of the bill that included language calling for withdrawing troops from Iraq. President Bush vetoed it. (McCain supported that veto, but didn&amp;amp;#8217;t call it &amp;amp;#8220;vetoing support for our troops.&amp;amp;#8221;) What Obama voted against was the same bill without withdrawal language. And he had voted yes on at least 10 other war funding bills prior to that single 2007 no vote.         Posted under FactCheck.org
