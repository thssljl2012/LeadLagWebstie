We bought a friggin&amp;#039; Insurance comapny, AIG. The US government basically  owns  AIG.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    Now the Feds&amp;amp;nbsp;want to lend MORE money in return for shares of other insurance companies.    &amp;amp;nbsp;    How much more socialistic can you get?  &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;
