McCain values life from conception, and Obama thinks a woman should be allowed to kill her baby from conception until birth, and sometimes even after birth. Welcome back to Nazi Germany.     Is it just me? McCain values life so much he wants to &amp;amp;quot;win&amp;amp;quot; in Iraq against &amp;amp;quot;terrorism&amp;amp;quot; which is a tactic, not a defined enemy. McCain loves life so much he doesn&amp;#039;t see anything wrong with slaughtering hundreds of thousands of Iraqis? McCain values life so much he bombed civilians in Vietnam? He values life so much he says &amp;amp;quot;we&amp;#039;re all Georgians&amp;amp;quot; and wants to take on Russia? Syria? Iran? &amp;amp;quot;Win&amp;amp;quot; in Afghanistan?  Meanwhile, Obama who favors abortion, is not the &amp;amp;quot;peace candidate.&amp;amp;quot; Obama wants to &amp;amp;quot;win&amp;amp;quot; in Afghanistan - a country that has never been conquered - the British and the Russians most recently failed there. Obama wants to go into Pakistan - well, we have already started the war in Pakistan. We have already gone into Syria.  Both candidates want more war, more blood shed.  Haven&amp;#039;t they, or any of you here, noticed the USA is bankrupt? Iraq costs 3 billion dollars a week. We taxpayers have recently bailed out Freddie and Fannie, AIG Insurance, Wall Street, and that is just the beginning of more bailouts to come. The big three automakers just got 25 billion and they announced they want more.  The ruling elite on Wall Street keep rewarding each other with millions of our bailout dollars in executive bonuses.  Haven&amp;#039;t you heard it is debatable which will fall first - the credit card bubble or the hospital/health care bubble - but there is NO debate about the fact that they both will fail.  What a scam - as if either candidate will not skewer us with taxes. There is a Great Depression coming to this country and the world. How can anyone seriously believe the squabbles about taxes the candidates spew?
