   &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; We have a constant litany of Repukes on this board talking about Democrats and socialism. Given&amp;amp;nbsp; the events of the past four weeks, that is hilarious. Bush has just spent a  trillion   of your dollars to nationalize the biggest insurance company in the world, AIG, the banks, and is considering having the government buy into failing corperations in order to save them. But this same bunch of crooks voted down 12 billion spread over 10 years to provide medical care for our needy children in this nation. Socialism for the rich, the very same people that he gave massive tax breaks to, and the same people that McCain says need even more tax breaks.
