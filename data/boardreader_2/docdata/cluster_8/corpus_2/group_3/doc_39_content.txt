                 If he truly is a banker like he says he is, maybe he was finally fired from AIG which is really saying something because it obviously doesn&amp;#039;t take that much intelligence to work for them and then had to money and therefore no internet and is no forced to live on the street. Wow...you really are stupid.&amp;amp;nbsp; Since when was AIG ever a bank?&amp;amp;nbsp; That&amp;#039;s an insurance company.&amp;amp;nbsp; Keep trying though, one of these days you&amp;#039;ll get something right...maybe.
