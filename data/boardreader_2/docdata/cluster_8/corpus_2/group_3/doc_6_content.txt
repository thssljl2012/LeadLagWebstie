Not opinion piece please. Obama wants taxpayers to be treated as investors in this failed&amp;amp;nbsp;bailout bill, but not the SS taxpayers to be the same. Or may be&amp;amp;nbsp;because of&amp;amp;nbsp;this bail out money, with interest if we are lucky,&amp;amp;nbsp;does not have to be returned to taxpayers,&amp;amp;nbsp;or in another term, accountability,&amp;amp;nbsp;as SS money does?.       Financial deregulation  In 1999, McCain voted for the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which passed in the Senate by a vote of 54-44. [52]  The deregulation bill loosened restrictions on the activities of banks, brokerage houses, and insurance companies. In 2002 he voted for the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which passed the Senate without opposition. [53]  In 2007, however, McCain stated that he regretted his vote in favor of Sarbanes-Oxley, [54]  which strengthened financial reporting requirements for publicly held companies but which has been the subject of complaints from businesses.  In 2008, McCain expressed approval of the results of financial deregulation by pointing to it as a model for health care policy, writing: &amp;quot;Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.&amp;quot; [55]   Later in 2008, in the wake of the widely publicized crises involving the insurance company  American International Group  and the brokerage houses Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, McCain stated: &amp;quot;In my administration, we&amp;#039;re going to hold people on Wall Street responsible. And we&amp;#039;re going to enact and enforce reforms to make sure that these outrages never happen in the first place.&amp;quot; [54]          &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;    &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;nbsp;   I think you are missing the entire question&amp;amp;nbsp;I asked. What I would like to know is which party, and its members, proposed bills on regulation and deregulation in this area. Given your answer as what is on Wikipedia,&amp;amp;nbsp;I think there are something missing. That is what McCain tried to do about the accounting gap of Freddie Mac&amp;amp;nbsp;and Fannie Mae&amp;amp;nbsp;in 2005. Where is it?. Or is it intentionally left out by you?. And what did Democrats do in the last two decades to prove that they proposed more regulation&amp;amp;nbsp;than McCain?. Especially when Obama say he did more&amp;amp;nbsp;on regulation&amp;amp;nbsp;than McCain does during the debate. Anything to prove what Obama said is right?. McCain is willing to apply more regulation if there are needed although I can say that he is also for deregulation as well. Does anyone dare to say the same about Democrats?.   &amp;amp;nbsp;   This is the link on what McCain tried to do in 2005    HERE   &amp;amp;nbsp;, and this is the text on Thomas    HERE    &amp;amp;nbsp;   The following portion of underlined&amp;amp;nbsp;text is an excerpt of the interview of Warren Buffet done by CNBC&amp;#039;s Becky Quick about five&amp;amp;nbsp;weeks ago.   &amp;amp;nbsp;      QUICK: If you imagine where things will go with Fannie and Freddie, and you think about the regulators, where were the regulators for what was happening, and can something like this be prevented from happening again?  Mr. BUFFETT: Well, it&amp;#039;s really an incredible case study in regulation because something called OFHEO was set up in 1992 by Congress, and the sole job of OFHEO was to watch over Fannie and Freddie, someone to watch over them. And they were there to evaluate the soundness and the accounting and all of that. Two companies were all they had to regulate. OFHEO has over 200 employees now. They have a budget now that&amp;#039;s $65 million a year, and all they have to do is look at two companies. I mean, you know, I look at more than two companies.  QUICK: Mm-hmm.  Mr. BUFFETT: And they sat there, made reports to the Congress, you can get them on the Internet, every year. And, in fact, they reported to Sarbanes and Oxley every year. And they went--wrote 100 page reports, and they said, `We&amp;#039;ve looked at these people and their standards are fine and their directors are fine and everything was fine.&amp;#039; And then all of a sudden you had two of the greatest accounting misstatements in history. You had all kinds of management malfeasance, and it all came out. And, of course, the classic thing was that after it all came out, OFHEO wrote a 350--340 page report examining what went wrong, and they blamed the management, they blamed the directors, they blamed&amp;amp;nbsp; the audit committee. They didn&amp;#039;t have a word in there about themselves, and they&amp;#039;re the ones that 200 people were going to work every day with just two companies to think about. It just shows the problems of regulation.     &amp;amp;nbsp;    This is the link for the transcript of entire interview    HERE    &amp;amp;nbsp;   What I do not understand is which one is correct, not enough regulation or too much regulation?. What good is having&amp;amp;nbsp;a bunch of&amp;amp;nbsp;watchers but they do not watch?. What good is having a bunch of watchers if they were bought?. And what good is a bunch of watchers if
