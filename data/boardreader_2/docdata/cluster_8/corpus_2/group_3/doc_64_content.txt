Because I refuse to become part of a socialized country.  What will those of us do that rebel against this evil take over.  Where would we go?  How would we live.  I refuse to work to give it all away to a bunch of lazy ass welfare mooches.  I pay enough already.  Help!                        Too late.      We nationalized a big chunk of the insurance industry last week (AIG), and this week we did the same to the banking industry.      Ironic, isn&amp;#039;t it?      To save capitalism, we had to enact socialist measures . . .      I wonder if any of the ideological zombies will learn to think independently and critically as a result . . .                         NAH!
