Lol angler it wouldn&amp;#039;t do any good, some people don&amp;#039;t want to let facts get in the way of a good conspiracy theory.  If money is taking more than 3 days to get to your account then ask your bank why, ANZ have never taken more than 3 days.  My other AU$ Paypal account is linked to Suncorp and withdrawals take longer, I don&amp;#039;t blame Paypal for this I blame the bank.  country-co op I am pleased you are prepared to pay extra for your purchased by sending a moneyorder, waiting forever for your item to arrive and not being in the least bothered if your item doesn&amp;#039;t arrive and the seller doesn&amp;#039;t refund you but I prefer to be a bit more circumspect with my money, although I am comfortably off I don&amp;#039;t see any point in risking throwing that money away.  As for keeping enough money in the account to cover current transactions then I have done my &amp;#039;risk assessment&amp;#039; and found the risk of a chargeback to be negligible and the risk of having 2 as being infinitesimal so, as any item over $50 has been sent registered, I keep a float of $100 in the account. ************************************************************************************  The biggest problem with having bags under your eyes is finding the shoes to match
