Or am I wrong....         Anyone interested in pooling money and buying up a small town to make a real capitalist country?                          I know of no recent such laws at least none that were designed to protect delinquent homeowners.      Generally speaking the laws of that nature are many decades old and designed to slow the foreclosue process to the point that (in a normal market) any delinquent homeowner who has any equity in his home  has enough time to sell the house, pay off the loan and walk away wiht his equity.         However there are TWO m/l recent laws (regulation changes actually) that may have had similar effects.        The first      dates back to the S/L bailout.  I don&amp;#039;t know the name f it it, but it put banks under increased scrutiny if they owned too many homes.  Thus banks that hold too many bad mortgages tend to either    - drag their feet on foreclosure (sell the property via short sale rather tahn foreclosure and outright sale)      or   - dump the properties they own for 60-70 cents on the dollar.      I don&amp;#039;t know that this would contribute to a bubble effect but it does mean that troubled banks avoid owning houses so they cna continue hdiing their trouble.        The second     is part of Sarbanes-Oxley (which was supposed to be the cure for Enron.    In the old days if a bank held the bonds on a $100,000 mortgage, and the homeowner is paying on the mortgage, the bank could record the value of the mortgage as $100,000 (even if the bond market temporarily dorpped).  Afterall, the face value of the mortgage is $100,000 and the borrower is paying  so the bank will get $100,000 plus interest.  So why not?      After Sarbanes-Oxley the &amp;amp;quot;mark to market&amp;amp;quot; rule was adopted.  That meant that everytime the bond market hicupped banks have to record the value of their mortages a little lower . . . . and will be shut down if they don&amp;#039;t suddenly raise cash.  Suddenly raising cash is not all that esy,  in a credit crunch it can and has led directly to the collapse of perfectly healthy banks      Similar rules were adopted for insurance companies (AIG) who insure the mortgages.  Even though most of the mortgages they insured (via credit defaults swaps) wre perfectly healthy they ahd to record them as being worthless and under the new law had to either close their doors or raise tens of billions in a few short days.
