Supposedly, those contracts are in the trillions of dollars as several institutions and hedge funds were trading CDOs without even having mortgages or other loans to protect.    Where have you been that you didn&amp;#039;t know this?   I didn&amp;#039;t know that we had interplanetary travel. Didn&amp;#039;t these news stories make into your copy of &amp;amp;quot;Universe Today&amp;amp;quot;?    All of this contributed to the credit markets drying up as investors really have no idea what the underlying value of the investments are worth anymore. Add to that people that can afford to pay their obligations, but instead choose to try to walk away from them, and where does that leave us?    Mortgage insurance worked well for everybody when the number of defaults was reasonably low.    Anyway, the idea behind mortgage insurance is that it protects the lender, not the borrower. The lenders are obligated to attempt to collect on loans even if those loans are insured. So it&amp;#039;s really not pertinent to the OP. Anyway, this was an investment property.    -David                      Icarus-     Lighten up!  What&amp;#039;s the point of your rude response?  It isn&amp;#039;t appreciated.  The smiley doesn&amp;#039;t help.     First, Im&amp;#039; well aware that the PMI insurance was underwritten by AIG, and was the primary reason AIG was going under.  However...I would assume the bailout also means those insurance contracts will be paid.  Is that incorrect?     I&amp;#039;m also aware AIG issued almost $300 billion of mortgage insurance on European loans.  Many foreigners invested in US real estate because of the low exchange rate and profits.  Will the US bailout money also be used to ensure the insurance is paid to banks in Europe?  Or, does AIG have a different European subsidiary?     The point I was making is the banks did limit their risk with PMI insurance paid by the borrower in many cases, but that still didn&amp;#039;t stop their greed and we&amp;#039;re all paying for it now.    Steve&amp;#039;s earlier respond described my feelings quite well.
