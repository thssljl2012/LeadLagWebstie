 I have been using a Barclays bank account for years for things like Mystery Shopping, matched betting etc, mainly because I have been too lazy to swap and can remember the account number!  I ususally have about 400 - 500 in this account, but have found out that the interest rate is only 0.1%     My main accounts are with A&amp;amp;amp;L.  Is it best to ask them to set me up another account, or go elsewhere and open a separate account?  I am happy with an internet only account, as long as I get a card and account number it should serve my purposes.     Any help or recommendations would be appreciated.
