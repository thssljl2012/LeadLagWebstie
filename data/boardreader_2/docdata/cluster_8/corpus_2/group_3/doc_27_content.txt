Since it was the 1st of the month, my mortgage was one of the payments made.     This made me wonder. Since the foreclosure rate is somewhere around 3&amp;amp;#37;, that means that billions of dollars are still being paid on those mortgages that are not in foreclosure. Why isn&amp;#039;t this money enough?     I could understand if a few companies had 30-40% of their loans defaulted on, but overall, how does the 3% have such a huge impact when the other 97% are paying on time. (Although that number may be off. I think I read somewhere that 6-7% of loans are in arrears, but that would still leave 93-94% of loans being paid on time.)    I may be missing the obvious here, but the companies are still getting all that money from those that are paying on time, so I don&amp;#039;t get why this money isn&amp;#039;t enough to lend out. It&amp;#039;s still 90+ percent of what they had to lend out before the houses foreclosed.                      The problem has several causes. One is a  lack of liquidity, the ability to turn a claimed asset into cash that can be loaned and thereby put to work to make additional money.     For some time, mortgage loans have not been held by the lender, they have been bundled and sold on to larger mortgage buyers who slice and dice them and pass them on to still other financial institutions. Your loan is a genuine asset because you pay it on time but those bundles contain a small number of bad loans as well. Because the process is largely unregulated, there is much opacity and at some point it becomes impossible to know how much of a securitized (mortgage-backed) asset (piece of commercial paper signifying ownership) is contaminated with toxic loans that won&amp;#039;t be paid back.    It doesn&amp;#039;t take much for an asset that was supposed to yield 4% to start to lose 2%. Naturally, these &amp;amp;quot;assets&amp;amp;quot; have become extremely difficult to sell since their true value is unknown so are hence illiquid.    The second reason these assets are a problem is because due to mark to market fair value accounting requirements a  regulated  institution has to treat them on their books not at the value they were purchased or the value they were hoped to be worth now, but at their actual fair market value, as best it can be determined. Because that value may be pennies on the dollar, since it is what someone is willing to pay at the moment for them, the assets are worth far less and may cause a bank&amp;#039;s overall assets to fall below the level of its reserve requirements making it impossible for it to legally loan.    A third problem is that the bankers often were worried about what was in their mortgage securities bundles and so purchased insurance (called credit default swaps to avoid regulation) and the insurance was supposed to prop up the value in the anticipated rare instance where the value fell. Turns out the insurance is worthless. AIG issued about $60 trillion dollars worth -- yes, four times the US GDP -- of CDSs, never expecting that the housing bubble would burst and the loans they were insuring would go into default thus destroying the value of the mortgage-backed securities they were insuring for fat fees. We saw what happened to AIG and it&amp;#039;s inability to actually insure has had a huge ripple effect throughout the institutions who thought they had hedged.    It&amp;#039;s a clusterfuck of mostly unregulated commerce that should never have been allowed to occur. Guess what party thinks the markets should be allowed to be manipulated by the cleverest crooks without government keeping them honest?
