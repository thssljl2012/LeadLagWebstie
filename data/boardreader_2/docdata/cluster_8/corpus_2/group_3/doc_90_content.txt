   Dear all - I&amp;#039;d really appreciate some opinions on the following situtation!       Following some advice posted on this site my wife and I applied for Barclays Tax Haven ISAs for 07/08 and advised my parents to do the same. We all applied pretty late (March 08). My wife and I are still awaiting final confirmation that our ISAs are set up but the money has been deducted so we assume they have been.        My mother however has had no end of problems - she opened the account in person in a Barclays branch and handed over a cheque. She received a letter a month later saying the account was open but the cheque was never cashed. She was advised to cancel the cheque which she did, went in person to the branch again and presented another cheque then everything went quiet and the second cheque was never cashed either. Despite 15 phonecalls to the helpline and several trips to the branch during which she was assured that it would be sorted out, she has just received a letter saying that they haven&amp;#039;t been able to open the account for her as they never received the funds and offering her a cheque for c. 200 by way of compensation (comprising a year&amp;#039;s missed interest).        Has anyone else had this experience and is this really all she is entitled to? It&amp;#039;s all very well giving a year&amp;#039;s worth of interest but clearly the opportunity cost, (i.e. lifetime value of the missed ISA allocation caused by Barclays&amp;#039; incompetence) is MUCH higher. It may also be worth mentioning that my Mother is a full-time carer for my Father - this is relevant in as much as every time she has had to visit the branch, she has had to make alternative arrangements for my Father&amp;#039;s care so the whole process has been considerably more inconvenient than it would have been otherwise.       I&amp;#039;d really appreciate any advice here - I&amp;#039;ve contacted Barclays who have agreeed to re-open the case but is there anything else I can do? They have admitted that they are in breach of FSA guidelines but the bottom line is that due to their incompetence my Mother has missed out on a year&amp;#039;s ISA allocation.      Thanks in advance  W
