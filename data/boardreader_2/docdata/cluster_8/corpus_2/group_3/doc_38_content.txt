Suppose I do great work for a company, make them a bunch of money. If that company has to borrow money to keep going, the last thing that company should do is stop paying me. Their best hope is to convince me to stay and bail them out by making them more money.   That&amp;#039;s what it would mean to be upset with the insurance agents who went to their annual award meeting. No AIG execs, just hard-working people who will now be expected to sell more so AIG can repay the loan. They should be coddled, not cursed.
