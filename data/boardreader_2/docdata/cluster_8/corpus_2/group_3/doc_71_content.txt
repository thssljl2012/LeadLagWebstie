 &amp;amp;nbsp;    Another point... (or more) do the candidates themselves know who gives them what? Wouldn&amp;#039;t they have staff to take care of and keep track of that? Did McCain get contributions from Fannie and Freddie (employees)? I think someone said he did, and more and someone said less. The CEOs that Obama said should be fired did they donate too? The contributions were from &amp;amp;quot;before&amp;amp;quot; all this happened with the financial crisis.  I don&amp;#039;t follow finances closely (I&amp;#039;m low income and was before so nothing much has changed)     &amp;amp;nbsp;I don&amp;#039;t know if it relates but I&amp;#039;ve heard the CEOs from the AIG (is that it?) the big insurance Co used $400,000 of the bailout money to go on vacation and play golf. Some are outspoken and outraged about this (Whoopi Goldberg for one)    So, maybe the real story is Obama thought the CEOs should be fired if they took the bailout money and used it for something other than helping PEOPLE (I think it&amp;#039;s meant to do?)    There&amp;#039;s so much misinformation and outright lies going around.
