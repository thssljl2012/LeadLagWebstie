It&amp;#039;s a fact. Yes Obama received $$ from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae but your story doesn&amp;#039;t hold up with you saying Obama is such a bad guy for taking Freddie and Fannie&amp;#039;s money like your guy McCain did not because in-fact that your candidate John McCain also took money from them as well.  OH, there are no federal lobbyists working for Obama but yet McCain has over 177 of them working for him.  You may think it does not matter but it does. McCain wanted to have campaign finance reform.
