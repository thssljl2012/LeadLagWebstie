Well it turns out it&amp;#039;s not who you think it is.  It&amp;#039;s folks like Joe Cassano, (see story below) the man many people think caused the recent collapse of AIG. The insurance giant that was recently bailed out with $75 billion of taxpayer money.  (They recently came back asking for another $38 billion)      John McCain thinks people like Joe Cassano pay too much in taxes and he wants to make the Bush tax cuts for America&amp;#039;s richest families permanent.  Barack Obama would allow the tax cuts for families making over $250,000 per year to expire, allowing their maximum tax rate to go from 35% back to 39%.        In contrast John McCain has proposed taxing the insurance benefits for ordinary working Americans for the first time in history, to pay for Mr. Cassano&amp;#039;s tax break.          McCain also wants to lower the taxes Mr. Cassano pays on capital gains and eliminate the inheritance taxes Mr. Cassano&amp;#039;s heirs might one day have to pay.      Personally, I don&amp;#039;t have a problem with Mr. Cassano paying a few dollars more in taxes.  I don&amp;#039;t have a problem with that at all.                      I&amp;#039;m curious why none of our friends on the McCain side have commented on this.  Instead I just see a bunch of posts about how Obama&amp;#039;s going to raise my taxes, with no mention of McCain&amp;#039;s plan to tax medical benefits.
