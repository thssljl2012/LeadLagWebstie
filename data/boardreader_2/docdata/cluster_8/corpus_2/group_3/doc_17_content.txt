It IS the Government&amp;#039;s fault when, in 1992, they pass the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, a government mandate to Freddie and Fannie to increase their purchases of mortgages for low-income and medium-income borrowers.  It IS the Government&amp;#039;s fault when... I dunno, someone WANTED there to be federal oversight of these entities:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MGT_cSi7Rs    But the Democrats (zOMG, he said it!) in the House wouldn&amp;#039;t have it.  It IS the Government&amp;#039;s fault when the Democrat Chris Dodd, Chairman of the Housing Committee (the committee that is supposed to exercise oversight on that industry) is receiving $800,000 in loans at a sweet interest rate from Countrywide, or has received generous campaign contributions from AIG Insurance, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns.
