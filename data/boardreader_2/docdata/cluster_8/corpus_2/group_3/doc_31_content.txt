PMI is Private Mortgage Insurance, yes, title insurance is the insurance against title defects.  To answer the original post I believe AIG underwrote a lot of that insurance coverage however, whatever insurance company it is think of the losses they are taking at this point... My house, at the height of the &amp;amp;quot;boom was appraised at $250,000, I have seen in my town now, the same model of house now going for $67,000 that is a $183,000 loss, multiply that by the millions of homes in foreclosure, that is a hefty bill.  And I know for a fact, as I worked as a title insurance agent for the most of this last real estate boom that alot of the home in foreclosure now are homes bought by people for investments trying to make a quick buck, there were a lot of speculators and that is a fact.  Saw it all the time, people sign as if it is their primary residence but at the closing table they are discussing what they can do with the home and how much rent they can get out of it...  These are the people that we are bailing out.!
