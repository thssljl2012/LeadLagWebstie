  Try the Co-op and Barclays anyway. Co-op used to give accounts to people who had owed them money but seem to be tightening the belt a bit but there has been nothing official yet so it is always worth a punt. Some have managed to get an account even still. Barclays again is hit or miss. If you are turned down by either you can appeal their descission as the government say that everyone is entitled to a bank account.    As the others say just ring your provider and say that you are changing your account and will need to have paper bills sent out until some thing is sorted out.
