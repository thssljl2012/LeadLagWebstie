AIG to keep core insurance, sell assets to pay U.S. loan: Financial News - Yahoo! Finance       Again people, the goal here is not to waste money but to minimize economic harm.  Giving AIG time to properly sell of assets is the best way of achieving this, and if the government does it well, the true cost is next to nothing.  For AIG they did it well and we will be paid in full.      Now for the rest of the money, paying &amp;amp;quot;above market value&amp;amp;quot; is not a problem.  People who say such things are economic illiterates.  Of course we are &amp;amp;quot;paying above market value&amp;amp;quot;, that is what a bailout it.      What people forget is that the market value changes over time.  What a liquidity crunch is in a nutshell is a scenario when there are few buyers, and in such situations the market value is artificially low.  The goal of the governments action is to allow the assets to be sold later, when the market value increases.  If done properly this will cost the government little, but at the same time greatly reduce the economic damage that would happen without the bailout.      Now of course the devil lies in the details, and it is possible for the government to lose everything, but theoretically the concept can and has worked in the past.
