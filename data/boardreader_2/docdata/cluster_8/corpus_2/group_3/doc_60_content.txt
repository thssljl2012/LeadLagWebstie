 while the small brain crowd is sitting in here screaming &amp;quot;obama will bring socialism...&amp;quot;  &amp;amp;nbsp;  You might try visiting reality. In reality, bush has socialized  &amp;amp;nbsp;  1. home lending completely, (fannie/freddie/FHA now account for the majority of loans, and are government owned)  2. Insurance (AIG, plus wait till the mortgage insurers go down)  3. banking. (see the nifty 250 billion injection this week into the 9 biggest banks this week?)  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Soon to come: The auto industry and the airlines. They are preparing those bailouts as we speak.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  It really gets tiresome when the uneducated thow their &amp;#039;dems will socialize&amp;#039; logic around. Try actually understanding national economics before you post.
