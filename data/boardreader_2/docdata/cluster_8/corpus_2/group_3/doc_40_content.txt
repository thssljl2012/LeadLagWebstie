As such, I would assume many of the mortgages in default are protected by insurance reducing the banks risk, no?                      Those insurance contracts brought down AIG, and several other financial institutions including Fannie Mae, etc, and even some countries. They were unregulated and trading on those insurance contracts wasn&amp;#039;t even reported.    Supposedly, those contracts are in the trillions of dollars as several institutions and hedge funds were trading CDOs without even having mortgages or other loans to protect.    Where have you been that you didn&amp;#039;t know this?   I didn&amp;#039;t know that we had interplanetary travel. Didn&amp;#039;t these news stories make into your copy of &amp;amp;quot;Universe Today&amp;amp;quot;?    All of this contributed to the credit markets drying up as investors really have no idea what the underlying value of the investments are worth anymore. Add to that people that can afford to pay their obligations, but instead choose to try to walk away from them, and where does that leave us?    Mortgage insurance worked well for everybody when the number of defaults was reasonably low.    Anyway, the idea behind mortgage insurance is that it protects the lender, not the borrower. The lenders are obligated to attempt to collect on loans even if those loans are insured. So it&amp;#039;s really not pertinent to the OP. Anyway, this was an investment property.    -David
