     Want to know where that  $123 Billion of your tax money  use for the bailout of AIG went?      &amp;amp;nbsp;    Well, AIG is using a portion of your tax money to lobby for looser regulation.      &amp;amp;nbsp;   &amp;amp;nbsp;Insurance giant  American International Group Inc  ( AIG .N) is spending money to lobby states to soften new controls on the mortgage industry, the  Wall Street Journal  said.    &amp;amp;nbsp;   State regulators said AIG is working to ease some provisions in a new  federal law , passed in July as part of a sweeping housing-industry rescue package, which establishes strict oversight of  mortgage originators , the paper said.     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Can we just have the FBI go in and grab these AIG executive a$$clowns and, after a swift trial, line them up and shoot the whole lot of &amp;#039;em?&amp;amp;nbsp; WEll, no, because apparently there weren&amp;#039;t strings attached to that money preventing them from using it to lobby for less regulation.      &amp;amp;nbsp;   When the U.S. government took control of failing mortgage titans Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, it prohibited them from lobbying. But it hasn&amp;#039;t banned the practice at AIG, a huge insurer that is still 20 percent-owned by public shareholders, the Journal said.     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Source:&amp;amp;nbsp;  Reuters       &amp;amp;nbsp;    In the interest of full disclosure, I worked for AIG from 2003-2006.
