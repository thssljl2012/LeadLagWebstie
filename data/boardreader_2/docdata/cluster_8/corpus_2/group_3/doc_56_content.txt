Well no one knows how safe are unsafe these are and they would buy them if they had some safety net which went belly up with AIG(AIG was selling insurance that would cover the value of those assets if they went sour, they didn&amp;#039;t have enough cash to cover the amount of claims) . Now the Gov isn&amp;#039;t afraid of some losses and can take most of it. They can also bargain these down to very low prices and make money in the end. Of Course there is a risk but 100% loss is unlikely.(hehe, like they said about them before they went bad but whatever.)  A lot of people still pay their mortgages every month. Not everyone is in the streets and not every subprime mortgage is going to be foreclosed either.   And I don&amp;#039;t know about you but I would prefer that a small business in small town USA get a loan to replenish it&amp;#039;s inventory they to see this spiral down and cause more harm. You can just inject money directly cause you aren&amp;#039;t fixing the issue. The Economy needs banks to get credit and leverage to do business. Without it there is not expansion and new jobs....
