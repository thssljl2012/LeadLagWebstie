 Although Fanny and Freddie are a significant part of the cause, the root cause of the credit collapse was the finacial derivatives invented and widely pumped by AIG and the investment banks, primarily that insane form of insurance known as Credit Default Swaps. The Bush administration , lead by Snow and then Paulson, ignored the threat posed by the large volume of these flawed and unregulated instruments, partly because their former (in Paulson&amp;#039;s case , at least) employers were making huge profits off of them. Bush himself is to be blamed for chosing his cabinet poorly, preferring to reward political contributers and cronies over selecting the best person for the job.   If all the risky mortgages held by both Fanny and Freddie were to actually default (which is unlikely) we would still only be looking at a $150-200B problem, rather than a $700B-$1T problem, and only the mortgage credit market would have been hurt, rather than all lending including interbank. The lions share goes to Bush, for crimimal negligence in the selection of the administrators of Treasury and HUD, and for giving his investment banker buddies a pass on risky investments that brought the whole house down. I deeply regret that I voted for the idiot twice.
