  I lost my 2007/08 allowance at another bank. They offered me five years interest, although they didn&amp;#039;t get the rate right.   I turned the offer down because, as you mention, it does not cover the loss beyond that period. It&amp;#039;s now in the hands of the FOS and I intend to push for the bank to have to put me in the position I would be in if it wasn&amp;#039;t for their error - in other words my 3,000 should be treated as a 2007-08 ISA. If they&amp;#039;re unable to rectify the error, alternative arrangements should made so I receive the same benefits and opportunities I would otherwise have (for example moving to a better interest rate elsewhere).     So far the tips I can give you are:  Make sure you go through the complaints process at Barclays. If they don&amp;#039;t resolve it after eight weeks or they send their final response, then take it to the FOS. Otherwise the FOS will just direct you back to Barclays. You can call the FOS will advice however about the complaints process at any time.     From what I understand of the ISA regulations (there&amp;#039;s a document on the HMRC site for ISA managers), an ISA is opened from the latest of two dates - the date of application or the date of subscription (when you give them the money to open it). I don&amp;#039;t know how your situation fits in exactly but if they regard the date of subscription as being too late, they may not be able to recitfy it. Equally, even if it was in time, it may be too late to rectify it. Try speaking to HMRC to get an idea of whether it&amp;#039;s still fixable. Either way I don&amp;#039;t think Barclays can avoid paying out - you have proof that you gave them the money (the original cheque) and it&amp;#039;s their fault for not processing it properly.     You could use as evidence that she would have kept it for longer a speech at the PIMA conference by Ed Balls in 2006 where he announced that the govt. would &amp;#039;make the ISA a permanent feature of the savings landscape. This open-ended commitment to the ISA will provide stability for savers&amp;#039;. If she has a history of using her ISA allowance that can also help it seems.     On the downside, the FOS seem to place a lot of emphasis on whether you&amp;#039;re a higher or basic rate taxpayer (because of the tax advantages). They might try to say it is a fair amount, the loss wouldn&amp;#039;t have been too significant etc. I don&amp;#039;t have a link at the moment but there are one or two example cases like this in their complaint round up newsletters on their website.     Personally I intend to fight my case all the way. The bank made the error and nothing less than fixing it right completely should be acceptable. These offers of 1/5 years interest are nothing more than bribes to make us go away as far as I&amp;#039;m concerned.
