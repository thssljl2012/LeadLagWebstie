                     For Whom the Bailout Tolls                                   You may already have heard how AIG, the insurance giant, after being saved to the tune of $85 billion, threw a $440,000 shindig at a California spa and then blew another $86,000 on a hunting trip to the English countryside, picking off partridge just as they were asking the Feds for an additional $38 billion. Bit of a sticky wicket, that.      Caught red-handed, AIG canceled plans for another 160 sales and promotion events that would have cost a cool $80 million AND  get this  agreed to stop spending millions of their newly gained tax dollars on lobbying efforts against increased government regulations -- this after being rescued from extinction by that very same government.      Talk about biting the hand that feeds you!      New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is demanding that AIG get back from its execs millions of dollars the insurer paid out as the company neared collapse, and on Wednesday, the insurance giant agreed to freeze $600 million worth of deferred compensation and bonuses for its top brass.       There are claw back provisions in the big $700 billion bailout passed by Congress three weeks ago, requiring that financial institutions get money back from their senior executives, if the payments were based on statements of earnings, gains, or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate.       But the executive pay limits in the legislation apparently have so many loopholes you could fly a fleet of Gulfstream corporate jets through them.      Oregon Congressman Peter de Fazio caught at least seven, that will protect their outrageous paychecks and golden parachutes, he wrote fellow Democratic House members, adding, Imagine how many more loopholes the Wall Street lawyers will find.       No doubt the nine banks into which the U.S. is planning to inject billions in capital  again, all taxpayer dollars  have their lawyers searching for those escape hatches.      Writing in the Seattle Post Intelligencer, Sarah Anderson and Sam Pizzigati of the Institute for Policy Studies calculated that last year the CEOs of those nine banks took home on average, $32.2 million each, nearly triple the average CEO pay at the 500 biggest U.S. companies. This is more than $600,000 a week. Apiece.       Bloomberg News columnist Jonathan Weil figures that since the start of fiscal 2004, the once mighty five of Wall Street  Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns  lost around $83 billion in stock market value. But they reported employee compensation of around $239 billion.       In other words, the engineers who dug this disastrous hole paid themselves almost three dollars for every dollar they lost.       The cost of all the bailouts to the taxpayer, as calculated by the Internet investigative newsroom ProPublica.org, is a whopping $8,750 per household, more than two and half times what lucky us got to fork over 20 years ago during the savings-and-loan crisis.       http://www.consortiumnews.com/2008/102408b.html
