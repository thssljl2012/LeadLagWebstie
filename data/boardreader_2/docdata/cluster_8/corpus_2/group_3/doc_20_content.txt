Depends what you mean by &amp;amp;quot;going down&amp;amp;quot; ?      Do you mean their stock prices or do you mean bankruptcy ?      If Canadian banks did the same thing USA banks did, then yes, we also would go down:      This whole thing started because US banks started loaning money to people without doing background checks, and gave huge mortgages to people that can never possibly pay back in their lifetime.    Banks then sold these to the Insurance companies, like AIG, so the banks&amp;#039; liability are backed up 100% (so they think).   Banks now have more money, so got more customers and did more mortgages like this.   Multiply this by thousands and thousands.   Then in turn AIG (and others) repacked it and sold it to other companies as something else.    Also, in 2005, USA law changed for insurance companies, they now only needed to keep 3% of the principal as cash on hand.       So, real estate was going down in USA, and then people lost jobs (GM, etc..), they cannot afford to pay mortgages on their $300,000 home anymore.   Can&amp;#039;t pay mortgage, bank takes your home, but its now worth only $200,000.    That person (no income now), still owes the bank $100,000 difference.   Obviously he cannot pay that without any job.    Multiply this scenario by tens of thousands.    Every Bank ---&amp;amp;gt; asks AIG  for money !   AIG only has 3% or so of it, so insurance companies are now screwed.   Cannot possibly pay out to every bank claiming their insurance.      Banks get no money from insurance, no money from mortgage customers = bankrupt (Lehman Bros)    Govern steps in and helps AIG with tons of money at 12% interest rate.   Govern. now tries to get 700 billion to buy up all the bad loan houses.    If this fails -----&amp;amp;gt;  USA = Recession    USA = Recession = Canada = Recession    So if Canada has been doing this, then yes, we will go down too.   As far as I know, CIBC is the most exposed to this mortgage scenario problem.
