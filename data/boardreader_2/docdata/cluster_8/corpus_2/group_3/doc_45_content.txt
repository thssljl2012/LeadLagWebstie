Dear Greatest GrandMaster SH,    Just one of these days, what goes around will comes around to these people  .

So where is the beef (or I am just asking for bread for the little people like us) Dame Warren Buffet . He is buying all the stock cheap and hope for the bail out package to pass and cash in. I said down with him too.    The truth is, AIG made enough money from this whole credit insurance scam. The company should pick up some responsibility and give some money back to US is if survive the whole thing. However, I did work for Mr. Ed (Liddy) before. Do you really think the talking horse is that ethic too?    Why not just freeze the money and asset of those financial companies&amp;#039; managers and only leave them with the cheapest house they have as primary resident?        If you read the story from NY time yesterday, you would see AIG was run by bunch of criminals who use to work for the junk bond king. What happen to that guy? He is now lives in London with a lot of money and laughing all the way to where ever he goes...
