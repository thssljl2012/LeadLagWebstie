         Hi all :)  I&amp;#039;ve posted a similar thread regarding sending money from the U.K to the U.S and I was wondering if anyone had any feedback on the following:  I have two  bank accounts  registered to my Paypal account; my Barclays account from the U.K and my Bank of America account in the U.S, where I am currently residing. I added 10 into Paypal from my Barclays account, and then proceeded to withdraw that amount into my Bank of America account. Once it had cleared, I received $17.21.  Does this seem like a good deal?  Also, am I able to send larger amounts, around 1000, in the same way, without incurring additional fees? I find Paypal so difficult to decipher.  Thanks for your help,  -EC
