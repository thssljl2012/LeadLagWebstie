 Ok so I just transfered $200AUSD from my ANZ bank account to my PayPal account and it warned it me that this could take up to 5-7 days. I then decided &amp;amp;quot;Heck why don&amp;#039;t I just test this out anyway...&amp;amp;quot; and proceeded to buy two games off Steam. I bought Fallout 3 ($69.99USD) and Left 4 Dead ($44.99USD) off the service expecting for it to say &amp;amp;quot;You do not have enough funds in your Paypal account for this purchase&amp;amp;quot;., but it went right ahead and bought them.      I checked my PayPal account and it says I have transfered $200AUSD from my bank account to PayPal and from that, ~$170AUSD onto Valve Corp. for the games - but there are no funds in my PayPal account and my bank account still has $200AUSD in it.      I&amp;#039;m scared I may have done somethig illegal. Anyone know if these is a bad thing? Also I&amp;#039;m not sure whether Steam took the money from my PayPal account or straight from my bank account because it says &amp;amp;quot;Transer &amp;amp;gt; From &amp;amp;gt; Bank account &amp;amp;gt; Completed &amp;amp;gt; $178.xxAUSD&amp;amp;quot;     Hmm...            ...
