   How many presidential campaigns have you paid attention to? Is this your first one? It sure seems like it...  No it was not a mistake for Palin to attack Obama... This is common in presidential campaigns... The VP does the dirty work...   And it certainly wasn&amp;#039;t out of bounds for Palin to call Obama a socialist. Many of his policies are deep rooted in socialism. I see the same uneducated people trying to make false claims of McCain having socialistic policies but these never work on someone of average intelligence.  A bailout of an institution is NOT socialism.   I don&amp;#039;t think you understand how significant some of these situations are. Particularly the AIG situation. AIG is the worlds largest Insurance company. If the Government allowed them to fail, several smaller companies would have failed as well. Not to mention millions would instantly have no coverage. As a result, when these millions attempted to get coverage... it would drive up the price of premiums... driving up the cost of insurance for EVERYONE...  The situation with the Banks is exactly the same as what happened in Japan in the early 1990&amp;#039;s. They are essentially doing the exact same thing here as they are doing in Europe to keep from falling into a depression.   The LAST thing anyone wants is for these banks to fail.   Your real problem with McCain is that he&amp;#039;s supporting a proven fiscally sound way to keep banks from failing... While Obama... well... let&amp;#039;s just say... his inexperience and his choice of lobbyists and cabinet members shows...   You do know who is in his inner circle right? Who is advising him on these matters... right? Or should I inform you about your own candidate?
