I&amp;#039;m not sure if anyone can help, but I seem to be having problems in opening up an account with either co-op or Barclays. Co-op have simply not replied after two weeks and Barclays refused me. The man in the Barclays branch took all my details and said that he had to run it through a credit check but that obviously as I&amp;#039;d told him my situation it should come up with a basic bank account. In the end it refused my application. I&amp;#039;ve never had any debt with Barclays though I must have a terrible credit record as some of my debt is around 4 years old. I&amp;#039;m also wondering if I&amp;#039;m on a &amp;#039;gone away&amp;#039; type database as I know at least one of my creditors hasn&amp;#039;t sent my anything since I moved house a while ago (though some have). Assuming I get no joy from co-op does anyone have any ideas? I have a salary cheque I&amp;#039;ve not been able to pay in for a week and desperately need to get access to some money for food etc. If the worst comes to the worse and I can&amp;#039;t get an account anywhere is there an easy way for me to at least be able to cash my cheque. I was with Nationwide for a couple of years prior to BR and operated my account cleanly but I believe that they don&amp;#039;t offer accounts anymore until I&amp;#039;m discharged. Hope someone can help.
