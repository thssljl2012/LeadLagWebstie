 AIG is an insurance company. Have major disasters occurred? Have half the houses in America burned down? Has a plague of locusts come and destroyed entire suburbs?     Nope. AIG&amp;#039;s failure isn&amp;#039;t due to any natural disaster. They just had a liquidity crisis because much of their financial holdings were mortgage securities. Previously people had thought mortgage securities were an extremely safe investment, since they are were backed by the Fannie and therefore the taxpayer.      The government is not backing them the way people expected it would (this crisis is also much larger then anyone expected). The government bailing out AIG is basically saying:    &amp;amp;quot;Ok, sorry about that Fannie Freddie thing. We really screwed you on that, but we&amp;#039;ll make it up to you.&amp;amp;quot;    In my opinion, the answer here is  nationalization . If Fannie and Freddie had been nationalized from the beginning there wouldn&amp;#039;t be this private sector crisis, things would be stable and there would still be lots of affordable housing.
