Greeting Young Lady,           Well, a lots of people in the know knew about the down fall of Wall Street banking and investment firms.  It is us the working class who don&amp;#039;t have a clue what&amp;#039;s is going on with our money who are on the losing side of this economic crisis.  Guess What? After AIG Insurance Company was given 85 billion dollars from the US Government, its executive have spent about 1/2 million dollars on a luxury weekend at a high-class resort.  The money that was promised to help home owners who had no business to own a home due to their low income; they will not get the help!  Banks and insurance companies were pushed into giving zero down payment to buy homes by poor working class in the USA. This was part of the problem the lead banks and investment   firm to lose so much money on top of the risky trades by its executives who lost trillion of dollars all over the world.  Also, don&amp;#039;t forget about the huge pay-offs to CEO&amp;#039;s and Walls  Street brokers. They were getting billions of billions of bonuses every year; the money that should have been given to the stock holders who had invested their money in those firms and companies.  Yes, indeed, and, the &amp;quot;Beat-Goes-On.&amp;quot;  All my best, M
