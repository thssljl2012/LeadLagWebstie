    Lionel:  That is true because that goes by definition.  Traditionally a borrower was &amp;quot;sub-prime&amp;quot; if they couldn&amp;#039;t qualify for a FM/FM loan.  Clinton help change that.    But the private sector was following the FM/FM model, after all they were the market leaders overall.  Issue a mortgage, &amp;quot;securitize&amp;quot; it, sell it as an asset complete with insurance (i.e. AIG), and/or retain it as an asset and borrow against it to issue more mortgages.    And the cycle continues.    So then doesn&amp;#039;t it follow that it makes no sense to blame the crisis on FM/FM?
