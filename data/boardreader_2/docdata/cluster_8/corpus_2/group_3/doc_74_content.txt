            Quote from: thrashbassist on October 08, 2008, 08:01:38 PM   Ah, yes. An additional 150 billion to accompany the 700 billion that went to offshore bank accounts, while not helping the market one bit, and creating more inflation and raising taxes.   Thanks a bunch, bitch!   Didn&amp;amp;#039;t the initial 700 billion have 150 billion in pork added to it by the senate so that the house would pass it? But, it&amp;amp;#039;s a revolving 700 billion, so with the additional 150 billion that adds up to 850+ billion. So, where is this new 150 billion stimulus package coming from, China isn&amp;amp;#039;t that stupid, tax payers are ticked off, do they just plan to print the money?  In any event, the bailout and the new stimulus proposed by Pelosi add up to 1+ trillion, add to that the loss of an estimated 2+ trillion in 401k/pension investments (although my guess is that that second figure is quite low). Our total now is 3+ trillion out the door.  The problem with the 3+ trillion number is that it does not begin to cover the 54&amp;amp;nbsp; trillion in derivatives out there, and those are just the gambling insurance. So, GET TO WORK AMERICA, because AIG needs to borrow more money, and then naturally they will need to decompress with another week at the spa. Come on people we have crooks to sponser here, and while you&amp;amp;#039;re at it why don&amp;amp;#039;t you pass over what remains of your 401k, if you&amp;amp;#039;ve got kids consider indentured servitude, oh never mind...that has already been covered.  On the bright side we will be needing a new math cirriculum, with landscaped pages so that the numbers can be accurately represented, oh and calculators that accomodate just a few more zeros.
