    McCain: Let&amp;#039;s deregulate health, just like banks?          Yesterday, McCain went on the attack and Obama tried to frame himself as the calm head, rising above partisanship. Today, Obama starts off on the attack:  The volatility of the stock market provides one opening to focus on McCain&amp;#039;s support for shifting part of SS into personal accounts invested in the stock market -- an idea that looks a bit scary at times like this. But he also gets a gift in a   just-published article by McCain on health care   in the Sept./Oct. issue of Contingencies, the magazine of the American Academy of Actuaries:  Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.   Wow.    Just as financial markets are tanking, the taxpayers are being asked to help with a $1 trillion bailout, and McCain is railing about the need for more regulation, he has an article in a health care magazine extolling the virtues of deregulating banking?   Here&amp;#039;s Obama, in Daytona today:   &amp;quot;Theres only one candidate whos called himself fundamentally a deregulator when deregulation is part of the problem. My opponent actually wrote in the current issue of a health care magazine  the current issue  quote  &amp;#039;Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.&amp;#039; So let me get this straight  he wants to run health care like theyve been running Wall Street. Well, Senator, I know some folks on Main Street who arent going to think thats a good idea.&amp;quot;   More Obama remarks after the jump.    OBAMA COMMENTS IN DAYTONA ON MCCAIN  *** Theres only one candidate whose campaign is being run by seven of Washingtons most powerful lobbyists. And folks, it isnt me. I dont take a dime from Washington lobbyists and special interests. They do not run my campaign. They will not run my White House. And they will not drown out the voices of the American people when Im President of the United States. So when  John McCain says that lobbyists wont even get past the front gate at his White House, my question is  whos going to stop them? Those seven lobbyists? His campaign manager? The economic advisor, who got a $40 million golden parachute when she was fired as a CEO? Or maybe the 26 advisors and fundraisers who lobbied for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? I mean, give me a break. The same day my opponent attacked me for being associated with a Fannie Mae guy Ive talked to for maybe 5 minutes in my entire life  the same day he did that  the head of the lobbying shop at Fannie Mae turned around and said wait a minute  when I see photographs of Senator McCains staff, it looks to me like the team of lobbyists who used to report to me. Folks, you cant make this stuff up. So when you hear John McCain talk about taking on the ol boy network in Washington  know this, on the McCain campaign, thats called a staff meeting.   &amp;amp;nbsp;  *** And Ill protect Social Security, while John McCain wants to privatize it. Without Social Security half of elderly women would be living in poverty  half. But if my opponent had his way, the millions of Floridians who rely on it wouldve had their Social Security tied up in the stock market this week. Millions wouldve watched as the market tumbled and their nest egg disappeared before their eyes. Millions of families wouldve been scrambling to figure out how to give their mothers and fathers, their grandmothers and grandfathers, the secure retirement that every American deserves. So I know Senator McCain is talking about a casino culture on Wall Street  but the fact is, hes the one who wants to gamble with your life savings. So lets be clear, when Im President, were not going to gamble with Social Security. Were not going to gamble with your ability to retire with dignity after a lifetime of hard work. Were going to strengthen and protect Social Security so its a safety net our families can count on -- today, tomorrow and always.     http://weblogs.newsday.com/news/local/longisland/politics/blog/2008/09/mccain_lets_deregulate_health.html
