PART 3  Big business at the table   McCain&amp;#039;s economic team is a far-flung enterprise, including dozens of specialists from Wall Street, universities and conservative think tanks  most dedicated to Republican ideals of low taxes and less regulation.  &amp;quot;I have a big Rolodex,&amp;quot; says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director who is McCain&amp;#039;s domestic policy adviser. &amp;quot;McCain likes a broad array of views. He&amp;#039;s not an ideological sort of guy.&amp;quot;  The campaign&amp;#039;s top economic advisers include Fiorina and Meg Whitman, formerly of eBay.  Democrats delight in pointing out Fiorina&amp;#039;s dismissal by the Hewlett-Packard board, which granted her an $11 million payout, the type of going-away package McCain rails against. Fiorina notes McCain has called for shareholder approval for executive pay packages and says hers was backed by shareholders.  Many members of McCain&amp;#039;s team are executives with strong ties to Wall Street:   John Thain became CEO of Merrill Lynch in December, after its board ousted Stan O&amp;#039;Neal. Thain&amp;#039;s $81 million pay package made him the second highest-earning CEO in the nation this year. Bloomberg News reported that Thain could make another $11 million in accelerated stock payouts in light of the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America.   During 2007, Whitman&amp;#039;s last full year as CEO at eBay, her salary, bonuses and stock options totaled $10 million. Forbes magazine estimated her personal wealth this year at $1.3 billion. In 2001 and 2002, she was director of Goldman Sachs, one of the two remaining independent investment banks in the USA.  Holtz-Eakin says he sees no conflict about consulting Thain, who joined the McCain team before taking over Merrill Lynch. He says Thain did a great job taking the company from a &amp;quot;troubled place&amp;quot; to a &amp;quot;successful purchase.&amp;quot;  Other McCain advisers include deregulation specialist Peter Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute and Taylor, the Stanford professor. Also on McCain&amp;#039;s list is Martin Feldstein, a top economics adviser to President Reagan.  Wallison, who has backed deregulation of business and financial markets throughout a career in government and the private sector, says he and McCain have &amp;quot;been for regulation when it&amp;#039;s necessary.&amp;quot; A former White House counsel to Ronald Reagan, he says McCain favored cracking down on the excesses of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac &amp;quot;when the Democrats were opposed to it.&amp;quot;  The financial crisis  and the calls for increased regulation it has inspired  has seemed to catch McCain off-guard at times. This week, he said he was opposed to a government bailout of insurance giant AIG. Then, after such a bailout was announced, he said it was probably necessary. (Obama did not express an opinion on the bailout but said it was the product of &amp;quot;failed economic policy&amp;quot; by Republicans.)  Thursday, McCain unveiled a plan to create a &amp;quot;mortgage and financial institutions trust&amp;quot; that would &amp;quot;identify institutions that are weak and take remedies to strengthen them.&amp;quot;
