The current financial crisis is due to financial institutions investing in subprime mortgages. The financial institutions, which included mortgage brokers (ie, Countrywide Financial), stock brokerages (ie, Lehman, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch), banks (ie, Washington Mutual), and insurance companies (ie, AIG); all acted out of greed to make loans at high interest rates to borrowers who could not make the loan payments when the economy went into recession.        Government regulation should have prevented these financial institutions from making loans to borrowers who could not reasonably be expected to be able to make the loan payments.        Repeal of the Glass Steagal Act in 1999 has nothing to do with the current financial crisis.
