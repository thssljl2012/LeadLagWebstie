&amp;quot;You might try visiting reality. In reality, bush has socialized   1. home lending completely, (fannie/freddie/FHA now account for the majority of loans, and are government owned) 2. Insurance (AIG, plus wait till the mortgage insurers go down) 3. banking. (see the nifty 250 billion injection this week into the 9 biggest banks this week?)&amp;quot;  Rob,  I thought that was Fascism, no?
