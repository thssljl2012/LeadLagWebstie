           Advertisements [ ? ]                         A friend of mine asked me why I was going to vote for Obama.  I told him some of the obvious reason why Barack is the best choice for this year, but he pressed me for &amp;quot;real world examples&amp;quot;.  I came up with this to send to him.  Why I Am Voting for Obama  On November 4th, we will decide who our next president is.  There are a myriad of reasons why people vote they way they do.  I thought Id share a few reasons why I will be voting for Barack Obama next month.  I am voting for Barack Obama because of Yahnajeah Kirkland.  Yahnajeah Kirkland was a bubbly 3-year-old girl with tons of personality.  She had energy only a child could have, and had a love for adventure.  Her only problem was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Yahnajeah was inadvertently shot in the head last fall by a stray bullet.  Her accuser fired the round from his gun because he wanted to impress his friends.    I believe Barack Obama has the ability to turn our urban communities around.  His innate ability to motivate and inspire people is critically needed at a time when hopelessness and despair threaten to ravage our communities further.  I am voting for Barack Obama because of Carlos Pandura.    Carlos was a corporal that was killed in Iraq during his third tour of duty.  His mother urged him to find an excuse not to go back, but Carlos remarked Mom, its my duty.    Barack Obama will put a responsible end to one of the most misguided military initiatives in American history.  Even more important, Obama will utilize our forces appropriately and responsibly.   He will make sure that we only put the lives of our brave men and women in peril when it is absolutely necessary to protect the values that we hold dear.  I am voting for Barack Obama because of my mother.  My mother is a first-generation immigrant to the United States from Africa.  She has risen from a hotel housekeeper to a compliance officer at one of the most prestigious insurance companies in America.  Her only misfortune is that the insurance company she works for is AIG.  My mother has worked day and night for over four decades and now stands to lose a significant portion of her retirement income because of the greed and callousness of corporate executives.  Barack Obama will work with congress to fight the ubiquitous abuses of power by corporations that have escalated to where $700 billion dollars is needed.  He will insure that this bail out gives the millions of Americans in financial peril a reason to keep fighting.    I am voting for Barack Obama because he is the right person for this position at this time in our countrys history.  We desperately need someone who can work with Congress to get America back on track.  I believe that Baracks dream of a truly united America is the most inspiring vision that I have ever heard articulated.  I will help make that dream a reality by voting for Barack Obama on November 4th.  I hope that about 59 million of my countrymen and women will join me.                        ...
