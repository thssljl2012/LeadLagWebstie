 abby - Insurance companies like AIG got burned with the financial companies because they were insuring against mortgage defaults, without looking at them each and every one. Maybe they could have done something, but under government mandate which really forced these loans, I doubt it. Also, I am annoyed that Paulsen just gave money to the banks instead of buying up those bad loans so they could be reworked, and with no strings attached - just go out and lend again, which the banks as yet haven&amp;#039;t done. That&amp;#039;s why nothing is going up.
