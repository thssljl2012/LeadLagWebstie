McCain mentioned the middle class.  He said he wants to bail out the failed mortgages with $300 mill. of the $700 mill bail out that was recently passed. What McCain didn&amp;#039;t say is that the Sec. of Treasury already has the power to do  such a thing. He could do so.  I&amp;#039;m not defending Obama&amp;#039;s email message.  But I&amp;#039;m worried that McCain&amp;#039;s supporters always point out and so did McCain several times during the debate last night that Obama was the second highest recipient of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac money.  McCain failed to mention that he too took money from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. And many of his 177 federal lobbyists are working for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.  In fact, there are over 354 members of congress who took money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. the complete list can be read here: http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/09/update-fannie-mae-and-fr eddie.html  John McCain, Senator from Arizona, took $21,000.  He also said Obama voted against legislation to regulate Freddie and Fannie. Obama countered with the fact that McCain voted down legislation that supported  regulation  of sub-prime loans on another bill that Obama supported.  Since they both took money from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and they both wanted to regulate sub-prime loans we the people need to see how similar they both really are in this particular matter.  But what I find offensive is McCain constantly brings up how Obama and his &amp;quot;cronies&amp;quot; as McCain called them are the ones who make soooooo much money from this mess but yet he himself made money from Mac and Mae.  On top of this, McCain says he&amp;#039;s a Maverick. He said he wanted campaign finance reform. But he is using the public money for his Pres. Campaign. He was broke and had to fire his entire campaign last summer. He won the Pres. nomination on almost no money, (or perhaps from donations from supporters and maybe his wife&amp;#039;s money)  Also, McCain talks a lot about &amp;quot;Earmarks&amp;quot; and them being so bad. Earmarks are $18 Bill. of our over 1/2 tril. annual budget. We&amp;#039;re in the hole over $10 trill. now from just the past 8 years. When G. W. Bush took office we had a surplus from Clinton working with the Rep. Congress and cutting out the fat everywhere.  McCain&amp;#039;s top campaign advisers include many people who lobby on behalf of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. They earn their money and help write the tax codes directly. Lobbyists are what have caused the overspending and mismanagement of funds. If earmarks are evil then by those standards McCain should hate lobbyist even more to the extreme. However, he has 177 prof. national lobbyists in his campaign. these include: (I&amp;#039;m copying and pasting because this is a long list. you can visit the full article here for the full list of McCain lobbyists: http://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2008/09/9753_mccain _campaign_lobbyists_wall_street_aig.html )   Of those 177 lobbyists, according to a Mother Jones review of Senate and House records, at least 83 have in recent years lobbied for the financial industry McCain now attacks. These are high-paid influence-peddlers who have been working the corridors of the nation&amp;#039;s capital to win favors and special treatment for investment banks, securities firms, hedge funds, accounting outfits, and insurance companies. Their clients have included AIG, the newest symbol of corporate excess; Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy on Monday sending the stock market into a tailspin; Merrill Lynch, which was bought out by Bank of America this week; and Washington Mutual, the banking giant that could be the next to fall. Among these 83 lobbyists are McCain&amp;#039;s chief political adviser, Charlie Black (JP Morgan, Washington Mutual Bank, Freddie Mac, Mortgage Bankers Association of America); McCain&amp;#039;s national finance co-chairman, Wayne Berman (AIG, Blackstone, Credit Suisse, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac); the campaign&amp;#039;s congressional liaison, John Green (Carlyle Group, Citigroup, Icahn Associates, Fannie Mae); McCain&amp;#039;s veep vetter, Arthur Culvahouse (Fannie Mae); and McCain&amp;#039;s transition planning chief, William Timmons Sr. (Citigroup, Freddie Mac, Vanguard Group).   I&amp;#039;m quoting &amp;quot;Kimberly&amp;quot; the originator of this post and responding to her above^^^ with my post..:)       Kimberly:  This is a copy of an e-mail I received today from the Obama camp. It states that John McCain &amp;quot;didn&amp;#039;t mention the middle class a single time&amp;quot; during the debate last night. I watched the debate and could swear that McCain talked about the middle class several times. I was paying attention because I am middle class. Am I mistaken? Is this just a play on words...he didn&amp;#039;t mention it a &amp;quot;single&amp;quot; time but several times? I am very disturbed by this e-mail. It seems as if they are blatantly lying to voters. I&amp;#039;m signed up for McCain&amp;#039;s e-mails too but have not received anything like this from his camp. Does this bother anyone else?   Friend --   I thought the differences between John McCain and me were pretty clear tonight.   I will fight for the middle class every day, and -- once again -- Senator McCain didn&amp;#039;t mention the middle class a single time during the debate.   If you agree that we need to cut taxes for 95% of working families, reduce health care costs, and end the war in Iraq responsibly, then I need your help right now.   And if you heard John McCain push more of the same discredited policies, including tax cuts for the wealthy and giant corporations, tax increases on health care, and continuing to spend $10 billion a month in Iraq, then now is the time to act.   Four weeks from tonight, we&amp;#039;ll know which of us will be the next president.   The time to make a difference in this election is running out -- please make a donation of $5 or more right now.   https://donate.barackobama.com/townhall   Thank you,   Barack
