They were new to the area, and i took a 300 advance on my salary via them, opting to pay back monthly in increments. After doing a little research, I decided them having a DD wasnt the safest thing to do, so I cancelled the arrangement, and told them i would pay in branch. Silly me missed the hidden section of the agreement that said they could take payment from my debit card, which they surupticiously gained by saying they needed to photocopy it for ID purposes. This card was duely cancelled, and i informed them i would pay in person at the store where I took the loan. Due to ill health over the new year, I thought it would be easier to make a 1 off payment from an account we dont use, which i did, stating at the time to not try and take extra from the account, as it was always empty. They took their payment of 10, then proceeded to take a further 30, leaving me overdrawn and with bank charges of 90 (which were given back) We cancelled that card also, and all has been quiet since may 08. But this morning, Loan Store have taken 468, from an account with 24p in it. My first thought is, how have they been able to take 468, why did the bank not decline it. Secondly, how have they got my new card details after 4 months of silence.    I have spoken to the Loan Store directly, who are their usual abrasive selves, told me I must have given them the card details (yeah right) and what they have done isn&amp;#039;t fraud, and that as i asked to be only contacted by letter, they suggest i do the same with them and hung up.    It is worth mentioning that this card they have taken funds from, is from an account that is no way tied to the original account used for the initial agreement. Also, it might be worth mentioning that the account is in my wifes name, and the agreement is in my name only. We have spoken to the bank(lloyds tsb) once before regarding the smaller amounts, and they refused to do anything about it, saying it was our fault for giving out the info.      These funds were earmarked 2 days ago, and we reported them at branch as possible fraud then. I fear as this account shows transactions to the loan store back in may, the bank with say its not fraud.     any ideas?                        Contact a lawyer.  Also before you do, both of you change banks and give them a letter that you will not be responsible for any charges coming from that company.      Did you write them a check for payment from your wife&amp;#039;s account or did you wife do it?  If they are doing direct debit(As we call it in the US Ach transaction) they got the number from your check.  Still that was not authorized if the did that, but it could say if your late, you authorize use to electronically withdraws from  your account.   Now, if it is debit card or credit card it should be considered fraud.   If my bank calls me a liar.  As soon as the funds clear,  close my accounts and find another bank.      I am not a lawyer please check with one before taking my advice.
