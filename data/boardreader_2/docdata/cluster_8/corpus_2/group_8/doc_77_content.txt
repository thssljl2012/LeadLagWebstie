Bongo Ears Obama and Congress continue to prove their stupidity. They never have time to do ANYTHING right the first time.      Congress shouldn&#8217;t be worried about the bonuses they specifically approved to happen. They should be looking for and firing AIG Management and employees that created the Sub-Prime loan packages and insured the packages. Any employee of AIG that tried to warn the world of the Sub-Prime loan  mess should get a big bonus.  Anyone who didn&#8217;t should be fired.      You don&#8217;t reward criminals for admitting the crimes they committed. You arrest them, convict them and put them in jail. Letting AIG management keep their jobs is unbelievable. Congress should have let AIG collapse  and had a reputable Insurance Group take over and fix AIG&#8217;s mess.      Congress is just propping up the rotting AIG Corpse.      Forget the bonuses. Congress should go into AIG and shut it down like the FDIC does with failed banks. Congress should put another insurance company in charge of AIG&#8217;s assets, fire all the AIG management and have another insurance company take over the company.      The new company, after AIG is taken over,  will have no AIG bonus problem.
