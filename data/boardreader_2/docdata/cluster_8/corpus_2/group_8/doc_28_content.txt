AIG is making money hands over fist in it's insurance dealings and that is the source of the bonuses. The problem and why it was rescued was the credit default swaps it held in Lehman brothers.   That goes back to deregulation of banking and insurance and I think everyone will agree that it was a bad idea     Greenspan wrong; credit-default traders disinfect market   Philly   10/17/2008        Pointing the Finger at Greenspan - ProPublica          I heard two opinions yesterday regarding the "contracts" that make more sense than anything I've heard in a long time.     First, the only penalty for breaking a contract is a lawsuit.  Let them sue.  I challenge anyone who can find 12 people anywhere in America who would serve on any jury that would find in AIG's favor in any litigation.     Second, there have been several instances, the first of which is the auto industry, where contracts have already been broken or are going to be renegotiated.  I don't see why this isn't an option in AIG's case.  These guys are raking in millions for destroying the economy.  Who pays ANYONE for failure?  AIG (and every other corporation in America) is using  the "retention" argument.  Two problems: first, 11 of 73 AIG "bonus babies" are not there anymore; second, who cares if they leave for another company?  Hello, they sent you into bankruptcy!!!!     That being said, the 100% tax works for me.  And I would name names, publicly humiliate them; these guys shouldn't be able to recover from this debacle.
