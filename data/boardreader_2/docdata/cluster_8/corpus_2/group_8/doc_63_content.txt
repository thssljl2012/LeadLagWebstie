                        Quote:           swoop10                                           If I'm not mistaken a new CEO was appointed by the gov. I also said okay to the first bailout but it has to stop. If we're going to hit a depression or whatever then lets get it over with. We're wasting an awful lot of money on companies who can't get their act together. The bonus money was 165 million dollars, but did you know that AIG gave 93 billion dollars to banks in Europe and Goldman Sacs. That is our tax money going to Europe and noone is reporting it.     The fact that congress is looking out for themselves is just another reason to start getting rid of these people and voting for someone with some ethics.                                                     I agree with you.   Yes, they have a new CEO, but all the remaining executives need to go as well.
