           Advertisements [ ? ]                 Edited on Tue Mar-17-09 09:09 PM by Canuckistanian          Reports over the weekend that bailed-out insurance giant AIG will be paying $165 million in bonuses to executives in the same business unit that brought the company to the brink of collapse last year have sparked bipartisan outrage. Even ultra-conservative Bill Kristol expressed his anger in a column yesterday, asking rhetorically, If capitalism is to survive, shouldnt the Republican party, the party that defends democratic capitalism, be particularly vehement in denouncing its excesses? Isnt this a pretty spectacular one?  However, it seems that Dana Perino, former President Bushs press secretary, didnt receive the memo. On C-Spans Washington Journal on Sunday, Perino defended the bonuses:      PERINO:  And the people who are working there that are middle-class people, are expecting to get this bonus. If they do not get it, maybe they wont be motivated enough to try to help the company turn around and getting the company to turn around and be more profitable is important for all of us.   It appears that Perino either doesnt know who is set to receive the bonuses or is unaware what it means to be middle class (i.e. those American households that generally make between $40,000 and $70,000 per year). In fact, while as of Sunday, it was unclear what the salary range is for the executives who are set to get the bonuses, as The New York Times reported at the time, some of them will receive more than $3 million in bonuses alone.    http://thinkprogress.org/2009/03/17/perino-defends-aig/                                  ...
