Moreover, investors or banks holding credit default swaps do not necessarily own the tranches of mortgages or bonds that the CDSs insure. AIG may have even written multiple swaps over the same mortgages or bonds. It would be like an insurance company selling earthquake insurance on one single house to multiple investors. When the house falls, so does AIG.   ...  Think again of the insured house. Many institutions hold insurance on the house; on the other side are insurance companies and the like making an opposite bet. If the house is destroyed, one group of institutions wins and the other group loses. Considering all institutions together, no money was truly lost  it's what economists call a zero-sum game. In good times, risk hungry banks loved this game, but now they have become risk averse, and the game seems to have changed. So how can many of the banks simultaneously claim enormous swap losses with no bank claiming significant profit?  Here are two possibilities: either the vast majority of all swaps  not just AIG's  are held by investment banks, or a significant portion is held by other financial institutions like hedge funds. Suppose all swaps are held by banks. Since swaps are a zero-sum game, the banking industry as a whole cannot lose money on swaps. Then there is no need for a bailout. (See TIME's "25 People to Blame For the Financial Collapse.")   Alternatively, if hedge funds hold significant positions, then it is possible for the banking industry as a whole to net a loss on swaps. That loss would be the hedge funds' gain. This means the bailout is ultimately saving the hedge funds.   ...    http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,188557...
