   House passes emergency legislation to impose 90% tax on executive bonuses paid with bail-out funds    Congress took punitive action against executives awarded millions in bonuses today to try to quell public outrage that has grown through the week and put the job of US treasury secretary Tim Geithner at risk.    The House of Representatives, frustrated at the apparent impotence of the President Barack Obama to deal with the issue, passed emergency legislation to impose 90% tax on the bonuses. About $165m (113bn) in bonuses were paid out this past Friday to executives of the failing insurance giant AIG.    The bonuses have become the focal point for simmering discontent in the US over the billions being paid to bail out struggling banks and financial institutions. Television bulletins have been dominated all week by the public backlash against the bonuses to the executives at AIG, which lost $100bn last year and has received $170bn in federal aid to keep it afloat.    The scandal mirrors the row in Britain over pay-outs to bankers and the same inability of the government to do much about it.    Obama, who was on the second day of a visit to California, has seen the AIG row wreck his carefully-laid plans to spend the week selling his $3.6tn spending plans to help lift the economy out of recession and promote alternative energy plans. He has been forced repeatedly to come to the defence of Geithner, saying he had "complete confidence" in him.    Republicans today called on Geithner to resign. The first was the Republican congressman Connie Mack, who said, in a statement: "I've had serious concerns about secretary Geithner from the moment he was nominated. In the months since, he has shown us time and again why he was the wrong choice for this critical post ... Timothy Geithner should either resign or be fired for the good of the country."    But Republican leaders, while critical of Geithner, have so far stopped short of calling for his resignation.    While Obama is unlikely to sack Geithner only a few months into his presidency, the scandal has weakened the treasury secretary and threatens to make it harder for the Obama administration to push through its ambitious plans for helping lift the US - and world - economy out of recession.    The House of Representatives today passed legislation drawn up on Tuesday after congressional offices were flooded with calls from constituents expressing disgust with the bonuses. Democratic members today stood up in the House one after another to express anger over the bonuses paid out to what one called the "barons of Wall Street" at a time when millions of Americans were struggling with unemployment.    The proposed tax on the bonuses is the first in a series of steps that Congress is planning to try to calm the public.    Most of the heat is on Geithner, with questions from Republicans, Democrats and the media about when he first knew about the bonuses. Geithner said he only heard about them for the first time on Tuesday of last week and informed Obama's senior advisers two days later.    Geithner told the White House that treasury lawyers had informed him that legally he could not stop the pay-outs. But by Monday, Obama, reflecting public opinion, began denouncing the bonuses and asking treasury officials to look for a way to claw the money back.    One plan Geithner is looking at is to make the next tranche of bail-out money to AIG, about $30m, conditional on return of the bonuses.    Geithner has been in difficulty almost since Obama appointed him. Congressional approval of his nomination was thrown into doubt when it emerged he had failed to pay income tax. Having squeaked through that crisis, he faced criticism for public performances that failed to inspire confidence that he was the right choice to handle the economy.    The role of the treasury secretary is critical given the scale of the economic crisis, and Geithner is having to juggle help for the financial institutions, Obama's unprecedented spending plans and preparations for the G20 summit in London next month.    Geithner's vulnerability does not help Obama at a time when he is already facing resistance from Republicans and some fiscally-conservative Democrats over the bail-outs and spending plans. Obama will face even more when, as expected, he has to go back to Congress to ask for billions more to bail out struggling banks and financial institutions.     The AIG row has emboldened Democrats as well as Republicans. A bloc of fiscally-conservative Democrats today put conditions on their support for Obama's budget due to begin its passage through the House next week.    The bloc, known as Blue Dog Democrats, want ceilings placed on Obama's ambitious spending plans.
