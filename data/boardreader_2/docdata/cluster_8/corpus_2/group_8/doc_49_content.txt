                        Quote:           bayoutider                                           It wouldn't be the Auto Union getting the bonus but the Auto Manufacturer executives. I think I read where the GM top man has declined his bonus for the year.                                                     I'm not talking about bonuses when I'm talking about the unions I'm talking about contracts.  It's pretty clear that the union contracts are one of the main problems with the auto manufacturer.  If you are for the gov breaking the contracts with AIG then the gov should break the contracts with the unions.      Did you know that Chris Dodd wrote an amendment in the porklus bill that said that these bonuses would not be touched.  These people have known about these bonuses for monthes and are out there running around acting like they are just as surprised as we are.  Also, did you know that the person who wrote the bailout bill for AIG was Giethner.  These politicians knew this was going to happen and they are playing us like fools.
