 Edited on Fri Mar-20-09 03:05 PM by ProSense         because a lot of people have questions. Here are   Eliot Spitzer's  :   So here are several questions that should be answered, in public, under oath, to clear the air:  What was the precise conversation among Bernanke, Geithner, Paulson, and Blankfein that preceded the initial $80 billion grant?   Was it already known who the counterparties were and what the exposure was for each of the counterparties?   What did Goldman, and all the other counterparties, know about AIG's financial condition at the time they executed the swaps or other contracts? Had they done adequate due diligence to see whether they were buying real protection? And why shouldn't they bear a percentage of the risk of failure of their own counterparty?   What is the deeper relationship between Goldman and AIG? Didn't they almost merge a few years ago but did not because Goldman couldn't get its arms around the black box that is AIG? If that is true, why should Goldman get bailed out? After all, they should have known as well as anybody that a big part of AIG's business model was not to pay on insurance it had issued.  Why weren't the counterparties immediately and fully disclosed?    At the very least, I can understand the questions.     Goldman CFO feels no guilt over AIG payments
