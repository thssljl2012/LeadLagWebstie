All the people below them who are having to deal with the stigma of working for AIG. Can you imagine being an insurance agent for them NOW?              Im an insurance agent (not through AIG) and I cant imagine it being any better that someone would come into the office and THEN finding out that theyre dealing with AIG - its more of a deception than Id think it would be worth. Either leave it the way it is or close the office entirely. I think it would be equally unsafe for someone to wander in and feel like the agency is hiding theyre AIG until they get you in there.       I used to have my auto insurance through AIG. The rates were reasonable when I had them,  and it was before all this mess happened. As soon as all this shit hit the fan I canceled the policy and went with another insurance company. My insurance company ran a credit check on me; I feel obliged to do the same on them. If they are blowing money the way they currently are I cannot trust them to pay out a claim if I shall ever need to file one.     This is responsible consumership.
