Joining a wave of public anger, President Barack Obama blistered insurance giant AIG for "recklessness and greed" Monday and pledged to try to block it from handing its executives $165 million in bonuses after taking billions in federal bailout money. "How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat?" Obama asked. "This isn't just a matter of dollars and cents. It's about our fundamental values."       Link                                                      Values?  A politician commenting on values?  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Good one Bayou.      Is greed a "value"?  I don't know too many CEOs that would qualify under the tradition sense.
