I'm sure those people think AIG is breaking the law or something only an evil corporation would do....      This is what pisses me off most...media spin, Obama and Pelosi all acting as if AIG is pulling a fast one over the American people when it's a fact that the Dems and Obama knew all about this way before hand.                         I support Obama but I agree with you.  This "outrage" is f*cking ridiculous and all it's doing is creating a mob mentality towards AIG when in fact, AIG under Liddy IS making a ton of progress in the right direction and these bonuses are contracts that were already in place.  It's not like Liddy can just say "Don't pay them" and face lawsuits.
