Excellent commentary on the AIG issue. AIG is primarily a back door to funding the banks on which taxpayer money will never be returned. AIG should have been taken over and the Insurance side kept intact or sold off. We have no business paying off banks that were involved in the mortgage business in the first place. My only guess is that it was a way of hiding how bad the banking problem really was. Also if banks are hiding losses via holding CDS contracts with AIG, there is no way to accurately access the situation. How many billions are being relied upon via assumed future AIG payments to the banks? Certainly the Fed and Treasury already have the answer to that. You think that would have come up in the 60 minutes interview! Maybe at this point in time Obama should tell the US taxpayer how much more AIG is expected to need. Then we can double the answer!
