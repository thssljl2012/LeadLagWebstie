  It  appears  at  this  juncture  that  the  story  behind  the  bonuses  is  this: . AIG  sold  insurance  against  defaults  on  mortgages.     AIG  called  this  insurance  a  "Credit  Default  Swap,"  or  "CDS"  for  short.    (I  like  that.   "CDS"  is  also  the  acronym  for  illegal  drugs,  "Controlled  Dangerous  Substances.")   When  AIG  executives  decided  to  sell  this  insurance,  in  effect  their  insurance  contract  said,  "We  bet  that  if  the  bus  driver  closes  his  eyes  when  he  drives,  he  WON'T  have  an  accident!" . So,  when  AIG  decided  to  sell  these  ridiculous  CDS  contracts,  they  hired  a  bunch  of  people  to  do  it,  saying,  "To  make  sure  that  you  experts  on  selling  CDS    will  not  leave  us,  we  are going  to  give  you  a  BIG  pile  of  money,  called  a  'bonus,'  at  the  end  of  the  year!     So,  please,  as  much  as  possible,  sell  as  many  contracts  as  you  can  betting  that  the  bus  driver  won't  hit  anything  if  he  drives  with  his  eyes  closed." . So,  the  bonuses  we  are  talking  about  is  money  which  complete  morons  agreed  to  pay  to  complete  morons,  to  make  sure  that  the  second  group  of  complete  morons  stayed  and  sold  as  many  ridiculous,  company-destroying  contracts  as  possible! . So,  these  bonuses  comprise  THE  actual  reward  paid  by  AIG  executives  to  THE  people  who  caused  AIG  to  go  under  so  that  it  needed  bailing-out,   for  THE  act  of  making  AIG  go  under.
