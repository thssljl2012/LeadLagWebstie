There are derivatives and derivatives. The kind that are killing us are uncomprehensible to almost everyone. "Thats where the similarity ends. Unlike your homeowners insurance, credit default swaps are unregulated. Investors were allowed to buy insurance on bonds they didnt even own, and companies like AIG were allowed to write credit insurance many times over on the same bond. These bonds, many of them backed by subprime mortgages, often were rated triple-A, so no one expected them to default. Collecting premiums looked like easy money. But when the housing market began to unwind, AIG had to begin making good on those credit default swaps. Worse, instead of just paying once, it had to pay many times over for the same defaulted bond. That became the financial equivalent of paying a dozen people for the full cost of replacing each home wiped out by a hurricane."
