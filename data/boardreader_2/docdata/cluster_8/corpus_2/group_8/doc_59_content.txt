 bbj:              Quote:              you guys are kvetching over $165 millions, or about .001 percent of what Congress has handed to AIG-- no questions asked. Have some perspective, and start getting outraged at the people you should be outraged at.                One of the rare times I agree w/ bbj. Congress knew going in that they would be paying pre-bailout contractually obligated bonuses. Look, if anyone on this board was hired by a company and promised a bonus for simply staying a year and then we did, we would want our bonus for fulfilling our end of the bargain. That taxpayers might be paying would be immaterial.        The $165 million is a fraction.  What is needed is to cushion the fall (which is needing more money than anybody thought imaginable), get the global economy moving by getting people spending again (which is taking more money than anybody thought imaginable),  getting credit markets flowing again (which would take less money if the markdowns weren't unreasonably steep), and putting global regulations into place that will prevent these kind of creative "securities" or anything like them from being created ever again.    _________________ Reg: "What's the point of fighting for his right to have babies when he can't have babies?!"
