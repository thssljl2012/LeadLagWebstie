                        Quote:           RhodeIslandRed                                           Here are the details of the AIG bonus provision.              Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't know if AIG is in the black without taxpayer monies. I would think that at the level of Congress, they can enact a special tax provision of say a 100% tax bracket for income over $500,000 for AIG or any other company which received TARP money, for example. As I understand it, Goldman-Sachs paid back $10 billion to the gov't so the CEO can avoid this income cap. For 2008, I believe he received $70 million in bonuses.       For anyone interested, here is the letter outlining which companies received gov't money via AIG due to derivative counterparty risk.         http://www.aig.com/aigweb/internet/e...385-153017.pdf                                                       Okay, you have some good points but you still miss the point.  If you let these companies go through bankrupcy then the contracts will be null and void.  If the contracts are voided the correct way, and your way is not the correct way, then these bonuses would not be payed.      Barney Frank said this morning that since the gov now owns  80% of AIG then maybe they should start firing these people.  It really hard for me to believe that when we have all of this unemployment our gov is talking about firing people for honoring a contract.  Stop bailing people out and let the process work the way it is supposed to work.  Gov controll is not the answer because they will extract that controll when and where they want and it won't always be in the direction that we need.
