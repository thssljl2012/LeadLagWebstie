The basic point here is that AIG was selling insurance on assets that it didn't have the funds to cover. Like you or I selling insurance on the Empire State Building or perhaps in another era the..er.. Titanic...but man those $10,000,000 premiums were sweet! Now when it comes to assessing the blame ,I give 80% to the brokers who were profiting by selling a product that they couldn't stand by and 20% to the supposedly sophisticated financial entities(customers) that were buying insurance without DD of proven reserves. Would you by your car insurance from a guy who hangs out at the train station? Meanwhile, Congress carps at the millions in bonuses to aforementioned "train station guys" while not addressing the BILLIONS they paid to policy holders on their behalf.
