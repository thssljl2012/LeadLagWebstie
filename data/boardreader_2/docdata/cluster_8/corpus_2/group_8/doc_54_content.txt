Rage at AIG Swells As Bonuses Go Out A tidal wave of public outrage over bonus payments swamped American International Group yesterday. Hired guards stood watch outside the suburban Connecticut offices of AIG Financial Products, the division whose exotic derivatives brought the insurance giant to the brink of collapse last year. Inside, death threats and angry letters flooded e-mail inboxes. Irate callers lit up the phone lines. Senior managers submitted their resignations. Some employees didn't show up at all. "It's a mob effect," one senior executive said. "It's putting people's lives in danger." http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/16/AR2009031602961_pf.html
