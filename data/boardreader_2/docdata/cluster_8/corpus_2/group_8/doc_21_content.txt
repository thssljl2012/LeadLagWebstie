Loans began going bad in these MBS &amp; the financial institutions who had bought those MBS began making insurance claims with AIG.    The financial whiz kids at AIG's financial products division basically made CDS bets they couldn't cover if the housing market were ever to implode as they'd leveraged AIG right up to the eyeballs with the CDS they'd underwritten.    Oh! One last thing.     The Credit Rating Agency that issued AAA ratings on those MBS so the AIG whiz kids could say they're safe &amp; no problem to issue CDS on?     Controlled &amp; manipulated by AIG's financial products division.     Anyway the long &amp; short of it? The $170 Billion is going out to cover the insurance claims coming in on the defaulting MBS that AIG's financial products division wrote.    And here's a news flash for all of ya'll.     As long as houses keep going into foreclosure, the claims will just keep a coming and we haven't even seen the foreclosure storm brewing over in the commercial real estate market.    Hang on to yourself, because this financial bailout roller coaster ride ain't over yet. Not by a long shot.
