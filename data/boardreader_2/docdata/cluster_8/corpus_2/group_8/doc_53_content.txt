  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29731643  /   AIGs turmoil depletes Obamas political capital Anger over bonuses paid to AIG execs blows back on president, initiatives  President Obama's apparent inability to block executive bonuses at insurance giant AIG has dealt a sharp blow to his young administration and is threatening to derail both public and congressional support for his ambitious political agenda.  Politicians in both parties flocked to express outrage over $165 million in bonuses paid out to executives at the company, demanding answers from the president and swamping yesterday's rollout of his efforts to spark lending to small businesses.    Evidently Obama needs to get back in his time machine to April 2008, and then tell AIG not to be stupid and make promises about bonuses they can't keep.
