           Advertisements [ ? ]                         President Barack Obama's political honeymoon is in danger of being brought to an abrupt end following a backlash against millions in bonuses being paid out by the ailing insurance giant AIG.  The row also threatens Obama's ambitious attempts to lift the country out of recession. Congressional leaders warned today they may not approve expected requests for further bail-outs for banks and financial institutions.  Congressional leaders queued up in front of television cameras on Capitol Hill today to express outrage over $165m (117m) in bonuses to seven AIG executives on Friday. This came after the federal government bailed out AIG, which lost $100bn last year.  Obama today sought to deflect attention from the row to the wider issue of how the recession is hurting ordinary Americans and the importance of Congress approving his $3.6tn budget. But his apparent lack of power to force the AIG executives to return the bonuses highlighted his administration's impotence.  http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/17/aig-bonuses...                                   ...
