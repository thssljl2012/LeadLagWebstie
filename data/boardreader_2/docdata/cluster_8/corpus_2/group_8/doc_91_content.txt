 Edited on Fri Mar-20-09 01:54 PM by karynnj         I knew tangentially some people who worked/work for AIG because some lived in my town and I met them through being involved in my kids' schools or through neighborhood events. (One AIG person from my town with a kid in my youngest daughter's grade was a 911 victim. He was attending a meeting.) They were no different than the people I met at AT&amp;T. They were different that the Bell Labs people, but not in any way that had anything to do with politics.  I have given money to people running for President, Senate or local offices at least back into the 1970s - though never all that much. I never was given a list of "good" people to support, though people were encouraged to contribute to AT&amp;T's PAC - something I refused (with no consequences) to do because I told the person circulating the payroll slips to do it - they might fund people I want to defeat. (In the groups I was in AT&amp;T had a junior new person do the solicitation job to avoid anyone feeling it could impact their careers.)  As to Kerry rejecting money from AIG employees, which other companies would you add to that list? In 2004, AIG was a prestigious insurance company.  Should he have excluded Verizon and AT&amp;T because of FISA (that was not then known)? That would have lost him contributions from many people I know who would be contributing either because he was the Democrat or because they really liked him.   The fact is that I would assume that most of the 2004 money was raised after Kerry was the nominee. It doesn't seem credible to me that Kerry likely even monitored by company the amount he was getting. There is a correlation between level and ability to give, but I seriously doubt that an executive would think that giving Kerry $2000 (the 2004 max) would buy more than maybe getting to go to a fund raiser and shaking his hand. There is no way that anyone could run for President and not be on these open secrets lists for nearly any major company that gets into some notoriety.   As to Dodd, I agree with you - he was in trouble before this week. I seriously don't think he can survive not telling the complete truth immediately on that language. It still would have looked bad, but nowhere near as bad as it does - and even the current quotes in the link seem disingenuous. Between that, the mortgage, and the fact that people are scared and unhappy - his popularity is in trouble. He is very unlucky that he is up for re-election in 2010 - though last year would likely have been bad too  - given when the mortgage came out.
