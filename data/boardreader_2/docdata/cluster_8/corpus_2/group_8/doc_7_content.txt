   Seeking Return of AIG Payouts, House OKs Tax on Bonuses  The House has overwhelmingly approved a measure to recoup taxpayer money by imposing a 90 percent tax on bonuses paid to employees at the insurance giant AIG. The tax would also apply to any company receiving more than $5 billion in bailout funds. A Senate version would impose a lower rate than the Houses 90 percent. The vote came hours after AIG complied with a New York state subpoena and disclosed the names of employees who received bonuses.       Protesters Rally Outside AIG Offices  Public outrage over the AIG bonuses fueled the congressional response. On Thursday, demonstrators gathered outside AIGs offices in Washington, D.C. to decry the bonus payouts.  Amy Swanson : Its not fair to all the working people here who struggle daily for our healthcare, income, pay their rent, pay their bills.      Joan Nemeth : Being paid $15,000 an hour compared to your workers hours at $8 or $10 or even $15, wheres the justice in that? There is no justice in being paid that much more.      Francisco Cuison : This bailout moneys from the government is taxpayers money, and it should be spread out to the people who needs it.        Geithner Admits Requesting Bonus Protection Provision  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, meanwhile, has admitted his staff asked Senator Christopher Dodd to insert a provision in the economic stimulus bill that allowed AIG to hand out the $165 million in bonuses. Geithner made the admission in an interview with CNN.  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner : We expressed concern about this specific provision, because we wanted to make sure it was strong enough to survive legal challenge. But we also worked with him to strengthen the overall framework, and his bill has this very important provision were relying on now to go back and see if we can recoup payments that were made that there was no legal ability to block.    The  New York Times  reports Senator Dodd is drawing outrage from constituents in his home state of Connecticut for his role in the AIG bonuses controversy. Dodd has come under scrutiny for admitting he was asked by the Treasury to include the bonus protection provision in the stimulus bill after initially claiming he didnt know how it got inserted.          Holbrooke Served on AIG Board      Meanwhile, a top Obama administration official is coming under scrutiny for his ties to AIG. Richard Holbrooke, the US special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan, served on AIGs board from 2001 until early last year. Holbrooke is believed to have collected up to $800,000 during his AIG stint.       Probe: Bailout Firms Owe $220M in Taxes  In other bailout news, a congressional probe has found the top thirteen firms to receive bailout money owe more than $220 million in unpaid federal taxes. Congress member John Lewis of Georgia, the chair of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight, says two of the companies owe more than $100 million apiece. The review only looked at the top twenty-three bailout recipients, leaving open the possibility of further owed taxes from nearly 450 remaining companies. The inspector general overseeing the federal bailout says he will investigate whether recipient companies misled Congress on their tax obligations.       Citigroup to Spend $10M on Exec Offices  The bailed-out financial giant Citigroup meanwhile is coming under scrutiny for a ten million dollar plan to build new offices for top executives. Citigroup has received $45 billion dollars under the taxpayer-funded bailout.
