                        Quote:           It's On A Slab                                           My company only pays bonuses when the company is making a profit.      If AIG is contractually obligated to pay these bonuses, I wonder about the criteria.   Wasn't AIG teetering on insolvency?                                                     Many companies now operate off of "guaranteed payments" when it comes to CEO and upper level management employment contracts. Our company does the same thing and I think it is the most asinine, counterproductive thing the company could do.
