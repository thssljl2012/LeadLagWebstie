Apparently this flap is rebounding onto Obama. That I didn't see coming, but I'm not suprised.  From today's WaPo:      Anger Over Firm Depletes Obama's Political Capital       President Obama's apparent inability to block executive bonuses at insurance giant AIG has dealt a sharp blow to his young administration and is threatening to derail both public and congressional support for his ambitious political agenda.          Politicians in both parties flocked to express outrage over $165 million in bonuses paid out to executives at the company, demanding answers from the president and swamping yesterday's rollout of his efforts to spark lending to small businesses.            The populist anger at the executives who ran their firms into the ground is increasingly blowing back on Obama, whom aides yesterday described as having little recourse in the face of legal contracts that guaranteed those bonuses.          I think we're seeing the acceleration of the mood change that set in a few weeks ago. Everybody has been asking "When does it become Obama's Recession? Obama's market collapse?".         Answer: today.
