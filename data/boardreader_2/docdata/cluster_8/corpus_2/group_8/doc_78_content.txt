People losing their homes, they don't pay home owners insurance.  This really hurt AIG being the main insurance company.      Like I  said before, I think these Bonus' are a bad thing, but I think this tax is even worst.  With the focus on the former CEO, I wouldn't be surprised if Libby gets canned and what's his face takes the company over again.      To me, this is more like a bull fight.  We're the bull.  AIG is the red flag being waved in our faces pissing us off.  The Bank and Government are the Matador stabbing us to death while we focus on the flag.
