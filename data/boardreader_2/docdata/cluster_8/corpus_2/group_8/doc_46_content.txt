You know create the 'retention wing' of the company and then starve it to death or sell it. I know this sort of thing is done in business all the time.                          They are trying to sell off many divisions, at the gov'ts direction.  It's one other reason you don't want to drive off your top performing sales peiople......you'd have little value to sell.     The problem with this "Wing" of AIG, is that the pricing errors were so large, that no one would buy......until it's cleaned up.     Here is the Math BTW...(In very general terms.     Let's say I have $1 trillion worth of Highly rated loan packages.  Let's say that the AIG models assumed that the worst case was that 7% of these would default (Historicially, less than 5% have ever defaulted in the last 50 years), let's also assume that the AIG models assumed that of the one's that defaulted, it would cost 10% of the loan value to dispose of the repossed property.  (again, historicially, the real disposal costs and losses have been under 5%)  Under those assumptions, $70 Billion in loans would default at a worst case cost of  $7 Billion in losses ($1 trillion X 7% X 10%). (and a reasonable cost of less than $2.0 Billion).  Based on this AIG prices the insurance on the full $1 trillion at 2% of the loans values, or $20 billion.......builds up their loss reserve and records a $13 billion profit.  On the surface, 2 years ago...this all looks reasonable.     Now flash forward.  The rating agencies lower the ratings on the loan packages, the default rate rises to 12% and values lose 30%...causing the cost per default to rise from very small to 25%.  The reestimate of the loss says it will be $30 billion ($1 trillion X 12% X 25%).  Since the original loss reserve was only recorded at $7 billion, AIG has to take a hit for $23 billion.  Their net loss on the transaction is $20 billion in revenue - $30 billion in losses or ($10) billion, but because they recorded the $13 billion gain when the transaction was recorded, they have to take a $23 billion hit.     I have oversimplified, and guessed at the %'s, but it shows how easy it is for theum to lose so much so quickly.  Remember, I used $1 trillion as my example...there are over $12 trillion in O/S residential mortgages in the US alone.  They were also insuring packages of commercial and non-US mortgages.     Len
