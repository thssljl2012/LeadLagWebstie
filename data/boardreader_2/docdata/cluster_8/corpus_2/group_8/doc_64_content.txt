                        Quote:           Crimson Speed                                           I agree with you.    Yes, they have a new CEO, but all the remaining executives need to go as well.                                                     You may be right, but my point is that these people took a job that told them that they would make this amount of money and if they met certain criterias they would get a bonus.  The gov gave AIG this money with no stipulations, so how can they now say that is not the way the gov wants them to spend it.  Why aren't they doing the samething with the auto unions.        We as taxpayers were given a stimulus check a while back and would you want the gov telling you how to spend it.  If the gov is going to give them the money then they either need to make it clear how to spend it or leave them alone.
