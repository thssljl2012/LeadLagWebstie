          Senate committee to explore taxing AIG bonuses      Won't happen.  Too many of them are on AIG's payroll.  How else did AIG get away with bribing insurance brokers with special commissions in 2004 to push their products?  How else did AIG get away with lying about their performance (similar to Enron) in 2004 to shareholders?  How else did AIG get away with having 2 of their employees get caught by the US Coast Guard dumping records off of the Cayman Islands in US waters in 2006?  How else did AIG get away with getting as many bailouts as needed from Washington while the automakers are begging on hands and knees and getting no response in 2008?  All this while the very same year they bought out 21st Century Insurance.  I should know.  I used to work for them.  Crooks.
