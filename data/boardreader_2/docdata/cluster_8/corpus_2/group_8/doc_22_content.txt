 anyone can take out insurance on the 300K home. So the insurer might have to pay $3,000,000 on the home, if 10 parties buy insurance on that dwelling.  Stupid, eh?  Well AIG issued insurance to the lenders and to any other party that wanted to be paid off if a collection of debts was defaulted on. What a gift! No wonder financial institutions bought this insurance, they would only lose if all of the mortgage holders paid their loans off. Incredibly, AIG must have thought that all of the packages of loans would be paid off, so they could keep the hefty premiums.  You can see where this ties into the bad mortgages, because to sell credit default swaps they needed more and more mortgages. If the seller could pay the mortgage, all the better, because AIG would pay the mortgage off, even if your bank didn't hold the paper.  Idiocy!
