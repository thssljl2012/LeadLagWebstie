         Some people wonder how Republicans ever win. This is how.   http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090317/ap_on_re_us/grassley_aig...     Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley suggested that AIG executives should accept responsibility for the collapse of the insurance giant by resigning or killing themselves.   When they are out of power, they are pit bulls about wasting taxpayer money.  That attitude gets them elected.  Sadly when they gain power, they turn into pugs.
