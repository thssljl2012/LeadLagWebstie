 no demand for accountability from them and letting them continue to screw the middle class on credit card rates and limit cuts.    "Nor has Obama demanded anything more in the way of accountability from those Wall Street swindlers than had the Bush administration. Under both presidents a total of $170 billion was given to insurance giant AIG, and, as The Wall Street Journal reported, at least $50 billion of that money was passed on to top foreign and domestic banks without any public accounting. Indeed, the second in command at the Fed told a Senate committee last week that he wouldnt reveal the names of the banks that grabbed our money.  Nor has there been any serious demand put on the banks to use the hundreds of billions in federal funds they received to increase liquidity. Indeed, the banks are raising interest rates and cutting limits on credit cards at a time when the government is hoping consumers will use those cards to pump some life into the retail market. As bank industry analyst Meredith Whitney wrote in a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed article, consumer credit card lines were reduced by nearly $500 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 alone. She estimates that credit card limits for consumers will be halved over the next year, mostly on consumers who have not done anything wrong. This will take credit away from people who have the ability to pay their bills, she notes.  So what we have here is socialism without even the pretense of a soul.
