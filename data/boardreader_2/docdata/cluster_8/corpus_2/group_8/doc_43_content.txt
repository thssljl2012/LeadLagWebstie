Insuring phantom bonds/CDS's..... "Investors were allowed to buy insurance on bonds they didnt even own, and companies like AIG were allowed to write credit insurance many times over on the same bond. when the housing market began to unwind, AIG had to begin making good on those credit default swaps. Worse, instead of just paying once, it had to pay many times over for the same defaulted bond. That became the financial equivalent of paying a dozen people for the full cost of replacing each home"
