         Hate mail, death threates and the like over at AIG:   http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03...    A tidal wave of public outrage over bonus payments swamped American International Group yesterday. Hired guards stood watch outside the suburban Connecticut offices of AIG Financial Products, the division whose exotic derivatives brought the insurance giant to the brink of collapse last year. Inside, death threats and angry letters flooded e-mail inboxes. Irate callers lit up the phone lines. Senior managers submitted their resignations. Some employees didn't show up at all.   "It's a mob effect," one senior executive said. "It's putting people's lives in danger."    Not that I had much, but Obama's irresponsible whipping up of anger has reduced all respect I ever had for the man to zero.    But, what do you expect?  Mindless populism bereft of principle or policy is what the democrats have to offer these days.  He's the ultimate fruit of a generation of party uselessness.
