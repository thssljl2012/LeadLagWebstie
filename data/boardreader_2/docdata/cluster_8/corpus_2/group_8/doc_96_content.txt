 I highly doubt that and I further doubt that "the London office" went off and did something as wild as these default swaps on their own.  Otherwise, I agree, I don't think people realize how many insurance companies are owned by AIG.  And that they sold annuities too, and that they're invested in a lot of other companies which means a bankrupt AIG would drive the stock down on solid businesses.  Which is why they never should have been allowed to any of this in the first place.
