A contract is a contract and if the gov can break one why they can't break others. AIG made money the last two monthes and I'm assuming the bonuses are from those profits. If you want the contracts broken then the companies need to go through chapter 11.                                                     Here are the details of the AIG bonus provision.                             Quote:                                        The payments to 400 employees of the financial-services unit -- some of whom no longer work at the insurer -- were promised last year before the federal government bailout. Bonuses range from as little as $1,000 to as much as $6.5 million.      ... AIG is already scheduled to pay $121.5 million in incentive payments for 2008 to senior executives and 6,400 of its employees. And AIG is laying out another $619 million for 2009 in retention payments to more than 4,000 employees.   Total expected payments amount to almost $1.2 billion.      ... Liddy also pointed out he won't receive a bonus and that the company cut bonus payments for it senior executives. The top 25 executives in the financial-product unit, moreover, have agreed to accept a salary of just $1 for the rest of 2009, his letter said.        http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Stor...701E15D9A59%7D                                                      Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't know if AIG is in the black without taxpayer monies. I would think that at the level of Congress, they can enact a special tax provision of say a 100% tax bracket for income over $500,000 for AIG or any other company which received TARP money, for example. As I understand it, Goldman-Sachs paid back $10 billion to the gov't so the CEO can avoid this income cap. For 2008, I believe he received $70 million in bonuses.     For anyone interested, here is the letter outlining which companies received gov't money via AIG due to derivative counterparty risk.       http://www.aig.com/aigweb/internet/e...385-153017.pdf
