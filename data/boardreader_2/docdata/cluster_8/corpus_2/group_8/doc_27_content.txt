Dodd also was the largest recipient of AIG campaign contributions.  Dodd, who sits on a committee regulating the banking industry, also got a low interest mortgage from Countrywide, a clear conflict of interest. Ditto for Bawney Frank.  More Democratic hypocrisy!      A bunch of idiots are screwing things up and now Obama finds out that he cannot block the bonuses even though AIG is taking millions and millions of our tax paying dollars!  Unbelievable.
