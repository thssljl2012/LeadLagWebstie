Even Freddie Mac &amp; Fannie Mae, a government sponsored entity with government oversight paid outrage bonuses. How naive can an adult be? And this is the anointed one, who is going to save us from the economic crisis, bring prosperity to everybody in the US, and achieve world peace by talking? Give me a break. Can we recall a president?     It is the Financial Division of AIG that got those huge bonuses. This division was the cause of the major problems at the company. Many sales people in the Insurance Divisions of AIG did not get their full bonuses for new business production they brought in. If the Democratic leadership in Congress (Reid and Pelosi) and President Obama had not been in such a hurry to ram the stimulus and budget bills through Congress they may have been aware that there was no provision in the bill to stop AIG from paying out those bonuses. There was no serious committee hearings or debates. So now we have a Congress where many of the members are saying they are shocked and a President who is on the Talk Show Circuit acting oblivious to the whole situation. Although AIG was wrong to pay those outrageous bonuses to the Financial Division, the blame can be also shared by Congress,the Treasury Secretary and the President for not doing their jobs.
