Politicians in both parties flocked to express outrage over $165 million in bonuses paid out to executives at the company, demanding answers from the president and swamping yesterday's rollout of his efforts to spark lending to small businesses.   The populist anger at the executives who ran their firms into the ground is increasingly blowing back on Obama, whom aides yesterday described as having little recourse in the face of legal contracts that guaranteed those bonuses.       http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn...600640_pf.html      Of course the public is angry with him.  They should be.  It's his fault.  It's a fault that he cannot blame on Bush either.  HE DID IT.  HE handed out that money and can't shake off the smell now.                               What did you expect from a neighborhood organizer???    He'll destroy the America I defended. He'll destroy the American way of life and capitalism. He'll take away the incentive to working hard and becoming successful. He'll kill us with more and more taxes! This Kenyan isn't qualified to shine my shoes! I say make him sit on the floor! Make him sweep the streets. Put a rifle in his hands and send him to Afghanistan!
