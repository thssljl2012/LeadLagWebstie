This division was the cause of the major problems at the company. Many sales people in the Insurance Divisions of AIG did not get their full bonuses for new business production they brought in. If the Democratic leadership in Congress (Reid and Pelosi) and President Obama had not been in such a hurry to ram the stimulus and budget bills through Congress they may have been aware that there was no provision in the bill to stop AIG from paying out those bonuses. There was no serious committee hearings or debates. So now we have a Congress where many of the members are saying they are shocked and a President who is on the Talk Show Circuit acting oblivious to the whole situation. Although AIG was wrong to pay those outrageous bonuses to the Financial Division, the blame can be also shared by Congress,the Treasury Secretary and the President for not doing their jobs.     Wrong, the bonus issue didn't even have to be discussed, they could have just accepted that these corporate heads would do the right thing with the money (just like you expect people to do the right thing with disaster relief or welfare or whatever), but they actually wanted to put language in the bill that denied the company the right to give bonuses, the treasury and others looking at it from a legal contractual...  never mind, had you watched last night on the tonight show Obama would have explained it to your dumb ass, in terms you could understand no less, which I believe was his point.
