     Quote:                           But the question remains...why give them any more bailout money at all???      Yes, they had a small group of execs make some very BAD decisions. When this happens to other companies, they suffer the consequences, why can't AIG as well? No one is TOO BIG to fail. Let 'em go. The fall-out to the general public will be minimal, if even felt at this point in the recession                     .      I completely agree...no more bailout funds to anyone especially aig.   If there to big to fail; there to big to exist.         I have heard arguements in the media that we "need" aig as they provide special insurance products all over the world that no one else can provide...I dont want them providing any more insurance products in the future especially the ones that no one else can provide...
