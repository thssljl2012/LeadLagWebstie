 Someone is trying to tie this to Obama instead of Dodd.   WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House stood by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Tuesday amid widespread outrage over millions of dollars in bonuses insurance giant AIG gave to executives after receiving federal bailout money.  White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said President Barack Obama had confidence in Geithner and the Treasury Department's oversight. But Gibbs underscored that Obama is working as quickly as possible with Congress to find ways to block the bonuses at the American International Group Inc. (AIG) or at least to recoup the money.  http://apnews.myway.com/article/20090317/D97025SG0.html
