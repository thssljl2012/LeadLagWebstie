In a memo, employees are advised to "avoid wearing any AIG apparel (bags, shirts, umbrellas, etc.) with the company insignia" and to make sure badges with the AIG name are not visible when they are outside the office.  Employees should also report to building security any individuals "who appear to be out of place or spending an inordinate amount of time near an AIG facility," according to the memo.   "Avoid public conversations involving AIG and do not engage any media personnel regarding the company," the memo also warned.  Visitors should be escorted by an AIG employee at all times when inside an AIG building, and employees are advised to "question individuals that you do not recognize and appear to be out of place."  Employees are also advised to avoid propping doors and be aware of those trying to "piggy back" into the building. # Click Here For Full AIG Coverage  2009 CNBC.com  URL:   http://www.cnbc.com/id/29787999/   Privacy Policy .
