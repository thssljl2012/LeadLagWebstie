Assuming I don&amp;#039;t take the loan they offer, and just get the information after they run the check, is there a net gain or net loss on my credit score?     Others have already given the short answer.  On a side note, if you&amp;#039;re pursuing a home-loan (like pre-qualification), and you&amp;#039;re shopping around for the best loan terms &amp;amp; rate, then it&amp;#039;s in your best interest to apply at all the loan agencies at the same time.  It&amp;#039;s normal and expected that a prospective homebuyer will shop around for a loan.  So multiple credit-inquiries (for a mortgage related product) will only trigger &amp;#039;1 hit&amp;#039; on your credit report.  At least, that&amp;#039;s what the Bank of America officer told me.  I think she said the time-window is 30 days (maybe it was 60?)
