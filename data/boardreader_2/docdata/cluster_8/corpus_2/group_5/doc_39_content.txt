          OK...as far as payment strategy...It seems like the consensus is to only pay the minimum on cards 1-4 and try to zero out #5 as quickly as possible by putting the extra that I would&amp;#039;ve put on cards 1-4 on #5 instead.   My only concern with that strategy is card #2 because I know that all payments on card #2 will be going to the 4.99% balance before it ever touches the 7.99% balance. My thinking is that by paying more than the minimum on this card, I&amp;#039;d pay down the 4% balance and get to the 7.99% balance quicker. Does anyone know where can I find an online calculator that will calculate my pay down with multiple cards and more than one rate on a card?   I don&amp;#039;t know of an online calculator that deals with multiple rates on the same card, but since the high rate on card #2 is the same as the rate on card #5, your effective rate on card #2 is always going to be the same as, or less than, card #5.  That makes card #5 your highest rate, so it&amp;#039;s the one that should be paid off first.  Right now, the effective rate on Card #2 is about 6.44%.  As you pay off the 4.99% balance, it will eventually increase to 7.99%.   This is a real concern of mine as well...especially after reviewing my statements and determining that the MONEY was given as balance transfers originally but they were &amp;amp;quot;re-classified&amp;amp;quot; to cash advances about 2 years ago...I had not realized this happened...this is TOTAL BS! How can this even be done legally ?   I seem to recall Bank of America doing this type of reclassification on my account a couple of years ago.  However, it&amp;#039;s not &amp;#039;TOTAL BS&amp;#039; - it&amp;#039;s more of a terminology change, since technically, balance transfers ARE cash advances.  When you do a BT, the creditor advances cash to another creditor, or to your bank account, depending on how you implement the BT.  This compares to purchases, where the creditor pays a vendor for goods or services you purchased directly using the card.  When I look at my BoA statement, I see two different &amp;amp;quot;Cash Advance&amp;amp;quot; categories - one for Balance Transfers and Convenience Checks, and one for advances from ATMs or Banks.  The ATM/Bank interest rate shown on the statement is significantly higher than BT/Convenience Check interest rate.  If your creditor is doing a similar type of classification, I don&amp;#039;t think that it should be a big cause of concern for you, as long as you continue to make your payments on time.  The one thing you may need to worry about is that the penalty rate, should you be late on your payment, would probably go to the ATM/Bank cash advance rate, rather than the Purchase rate.
