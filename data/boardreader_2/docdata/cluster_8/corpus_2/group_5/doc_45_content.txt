            Quote:   And here ya go....  I had to short sale my house earlier this year. I quit making the payments and expected all the fallout of trashing my credit. After it was all said and done, my score had dropped about 120 points. My credit union that I&amp;#039;d been banking with for 7 years cut off my credit line even though I had a flawless payment history with them. When I called and asked wtf, they just told me that my score had dropped below their minimum requirement. I have a car loan and credit card account with them that I&amp;#039;ve stopped paying on. Im currently 60 days past due on 3 credit accounts and my credit score hasn&amp;#039;t gotten any worse.  I also had a credit card I use for my business jack up my rate to 32.5% for apparently no reason other than the drop in my credit score.  The banks just seem to be raping the good customers to make up for all the money they&amp;#039;re losing to the people that have stopped paying their mortgages, etc. But isn&amp;#039;t that what the bailout is supposed to be for? Oh yeah, we&amp;#039;re paying for that too so either way, you&amp;#039;re fvcked.           Stop making youre mortgage payments you deserve what happens to you. You certainly are  not a good customer. You are a high risk. Be responsible,pay youre bills whatever they might be, whatever you signed up for and deal with the consequences. In this  country we have choices. Make Good ones I reccomend. You might try listening to the DAVE RAMSEY radio show as well.
