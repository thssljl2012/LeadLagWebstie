Yes, normally a debit card has a Visa logo so you should be able to buy things online. However, I would recommend getting a credit card later because it&amp;#039;s safer. You&amp;#039;ll get rewards such as cash back or points to earn certain stuff. What I mean by safer is credit card offered fraud liability so you should be protected up to $1,000 depends on certain company. If you never have a credit card, just applying for a student credit card if you are one. I think Bank of America got me approve right away without a co-signer and it offered me world points. After you established enough credit go apply for a better reward credit card.  :)       For now just order games or clothes online with your debt card
