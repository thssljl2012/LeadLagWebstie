 IndiaMike.com sorry to bring this thread back from the dead... Bank of America charges me $5 PLUS 1% to use overseas ATMs that are not affiliated which includes all ATMs in India.  I am going to be in India in the next 15 days and I see the exchange rate is at 47.7/$, if I just take some cash and exchange it in Bangalore (in the city), what kind of rate would you think I would get?      I know most of you suggest using an ATM card but mine (BoA) charges crazy fees.
