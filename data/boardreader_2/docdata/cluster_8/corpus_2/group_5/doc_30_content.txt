This is troubling to say the least.  An Illinois Governor threatens to stop using Bank of America&amp;#039;s services if they don&amp;#039;t extend credit to failinga company (they do not own) so they can pay their workers compensation...more troubling is that Obama has stated he supports the idea.....outrages!!!!!
