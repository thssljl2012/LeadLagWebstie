            Quote:   The banks aren&amp;#039;t taking the risks of giving credit anymore without sufficient reward.       The card people keep sending me applications with all sorts of inducements.  I only need 3 C.C.s, so I keep shredding them.  About 3 years ago, I deep-sixed a C.C. that I held for 10+ years for no real reason other than me being tired of getting their phone call &amp;quot;try this new crap out&amp;quot; sale pitches.  When they called me up and tried to get me back, I told them why I got rid of them.  There was a bit of &amp;quot;you&amp;#039;ll be sorry&amp;quot; and some &amp;quot;we only offer what we beleive the consumer can truly use&amp;quot;, and I was all like &amp;quot;cry me a river...you guys kept calling me and you didn&amp;#039;t listen to me when I told your company to knock it off&amp;quot;.  It was then they warned me of how it might appear on my credit report.    Oh brother....financial industry spin....
