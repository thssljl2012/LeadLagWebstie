 One of the shittiest parts of this is that it took me over half an hour to get any of the ass holes from Bank of America on the phone to get the damn card canceled, then the woman told me they were trying to use it again! I asked her if she was going to call the police to the area and she said she can't???!!! WTF! There's some rule with the bank that says no action can be taken on a pending transaction... I have to wait until it posts until I can file a fraud complaint.... That's not until tomorrow.
