         who cares?  dont spend money you dont have and your fine.  I&amp;#039;ve got a BofA platinum card (whatever that means) and I have no fcking clue what my interest rate is.  I buy shhit with it, go home, and pay it off immediately in full.  I&amp;#039;ll never buy something I don&amp;#039;t already have money for, the only reason I have this damn card is cuz maintaining good credit is such a big deal in this world.
