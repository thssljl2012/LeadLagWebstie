                                                                                        SO my uncle just told my mom&amp;amp;nbsp;that somebody spent $12,000 using his debit card. He lives in Bolivia and went to Miami for a few days to do some negotiations.&amp;amp;nbsp;All the time he stood in&amp;amp;nbsp;Miami he only&amp;amp;nbsp;paid for&amp;amp;nbsp;restaurants and hotel... so&amp;amp;nbsp;he is sure that somebody (waiter or waitress)&amp;amp;nbsp;in one of the restaurants copied the information of his card and then used it to buy clothes by phone in Miami.  The same happened to my moms best friend the other day, except that they only spent like $2,000 from her and she&amp;amp;nbsp;believes that it was somebody in a restaurant that could have copied her information  a few minutes ago I checked my Bank Statements&amp;amp;nbsp;and a Coffee place from Sacramento&amp;amp;nbsp;charged me for two coffees&amp;amp;nbsp;that supposely I got&amp;amp;nbsp;3 days ago... and thats impossible because&amp;amp;nbsp;I was in SF... Then I discovered that a store charged me twice for a jacket that I bought last week... SO&amp;amp;nbsp;I am pissed and I called Bank Of America to dispute for those items! and this is the second time... last time Bank Of america charged me twice for money that I took from an ATM...&amp;amp;nbsp;OH and&amp;amp;nbsp;bank of america just canceled my card because of all the disputes... they will send me a&amp;amp;nbsp;new card in 5 days!! grrrrrrrrr I dont have a credit cards&amp;amp;nbsp;and 0 cash!! this is soo annoying!  Anyways, the point is that people are desperate!! and we have to be careful when using our cards!
