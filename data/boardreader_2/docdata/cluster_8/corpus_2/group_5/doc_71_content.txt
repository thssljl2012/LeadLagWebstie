 Thank you, I couldn't have said this better myself!  Slash the salaries and stock options at the executive level first, do away with their bonuses and golden parachutes completely, and only  then  should you talk about cutting the pay of regular rank and file employees, many of whom are probably working two jobs to make ends meet already.

Direct your anger at the CEO's and your government officials.   Their pay went up almost 10x what white/blue collar workers got.   They got millions in bonuses and stock options.  We got slashed pensions and the right to fund our own pensions.      Blue or White collar, it doesn't matter..we are all going to pay for the greed of a few at the top.
