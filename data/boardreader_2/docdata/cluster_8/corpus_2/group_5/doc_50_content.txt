            Quote:   Throw Wells Fargo in there as well. They&amp;#039;ve been hittin&amp;#039; me with &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot; charges. The kook on the phone was the most unprofessional, rudest prick I&amp;#039;ve ever talked to. Raised his voice at me and that was all it took.  Told him to go fvck himself and hung up on him. Closing my account today. STAY AWAY FROM WELLS FARGO!!!   Time to start stuffing a matress.           Wow, no good. We thankfully don&amp;#039;t have credit cards with them, just an account and check cards. Nice cause they can be used like a VISA but the money comes directly out of our account instead of going on credit. D canceled all of his old BofA credit cards last year, and closed his account there for other reasons, but we&amp;#039;re happy he did! We can&amp;#039;t afford more debt right now, so ditching the credit cards was an awesome move.      -------------------- What doesn&amp;#039;t kill you, really does make you stronger than you were before.
