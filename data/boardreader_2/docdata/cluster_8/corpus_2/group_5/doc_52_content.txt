            Quote:   I had a 3.99 fixed &amp;quot;for the life of the balance&amp;quot; on a balance transfer.        Did they raise the rate on the &amp;#039;balance transfer&amp;#039; or on your other charges? Did you miss a payment, pay late, or pay less than the min. payment?      -------------------- candid shots as opposed to posed shots are two very different things.
