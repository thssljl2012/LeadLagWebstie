  I read today that the company will not remain solvent even with the line of credit- which tells you something why Bank of America (one of the few solvent banks left) isn&amp;#039;t willing to extend credit to the company. Is it that B of A won&amp;#039;t extend them credit or won&amp;#039;t extend them any MORE credit? It seems likely to me that the company already owes BofA (or some other bank)quite a bit, and the bank is unwilling to give them a larger line. A company has to be in pretty bad shape not to make payroll. Most companies stiff their creditors before their employees.
