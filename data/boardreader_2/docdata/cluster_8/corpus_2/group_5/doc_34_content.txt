They changed the amount of credit that they were willing to extend you based on a very real drop in your credit score and you get insulted and just decide to stop paying. F- You...this is what&amp;#039;s wrong with America.  I hate duchebags like you.                That&amp;#039;s right asswipe...God bless America and all the motherfvckers that live here!!          -------------------- After you leave, you&amp;#039;ll want to go back real bad. Then when you do, you&amp;#039;ll remember why you left.
