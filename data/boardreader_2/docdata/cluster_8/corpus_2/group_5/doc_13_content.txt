Will they keep making cars they can not sell in order to keep all those people employed?                      What part of &amp;quot;tooling up for clean tech jobs&amp;quot; didn't you understand?  Also, as I'll show, there are markets that are emerging that auto makers have been dreaming about for quite some time now.           Quote:                         There is no difference between the management of the Big 3 and the management of AIG.  Why are we rewarding either for bad performance?  Do you think AIG doesn't have employees?                     For one thing, AIG is an insurance company - NO SUPPLY CHAIN TO SAVE.   As far as the management, the Big Three's upper level execs need to be fired ASAP and replaced with folks who can actually do the job.           Quote:                         The bankruptcy protections keep them from having to immediately make good on their borrowing.  You are claiming that borrowing is going to save them.  So if we loan it to them so they can pay their debts or if they are relieved from having to pay their debts what is the difference beyond 14B in deficit spending?                     Chapter 11 reorg bankruptcy is dependent on capital line-of-credit investment by large corporate lending institutions.  That's what Chapter 11 is all about.  This bread-and-butter financing allows the company to continue operations (lights, raw materials, paying suppliers for new inventory, as well as protecting them from old inventory bills) until a new plan can be put into place and the ownership issues can be worked out among the creditors.  If no financing (for these operational activities) is forthcoming, the tenets of Chapter 11 bankruptcy can't be met, and Chapter 7 bankruptcy is then declared.  Right now, with the &amp;quot;credit crunch&amp;quot; and the Wall Street banks squirreling all their cash away (that'd be the cash we gave them to loan), there's no lending of that sort available.  The government's &amp;quot;bailout&amp;quot; is that Chapter 11 bankruptcy financing package that the Wall Street banks refuse to make available now.        Chapter 11 is a chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, which permits reorganization under the bankruptcy laws of the United States. Chapter 11 bankruptcy is available to any business, whether organized as a corporation or sole proprietorship, and to individuals, although it is most prominently used by corporate entities. In contrast, Chapter 7 governs the process of a liquidation bankruptcy, while Chapter 13 provides a reorganization process for the majority of private individuals with unsecured debts of less than $336,900.00 and secured debts of less than $1,010,650.00 as of April 1, 2007  .              Quote:                         And the big 3 will not keep buying supplies they won't use in cars and paying workers they won't have building cars.  So you will again be giving billions of dollars and not getting the result you claim to want.                     Did you know that the new market for autos is China?       http://us.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/1/t240773.htm       GM actually had an 8% spike last quarter in their China market. The Chinese love American cars, and they (as a society) hate the Japanese, due to historical issues.  That market is enormous, and it's a fledgling market.  So many people with growing income, and tired of riding bicycles.      India is also emerging as an automaker's wetdream.       http://www.ibef.org/artdisplay.aspx?...6666&amp;amp;cat_id=60       They also love American cars, although they have nothing against Japanese products per se.  These two emerging markets are why our auto industry needs to survive. The Japanese will own these markets if we let our own auto industry fall.  In fact, Japan and Korea, and Germany as well, are propping up their auto industries right now with these two super-sized markets in mind.            Quote:                         OK, again, that pension and healthcare are all costs that were deferred.  That was compensation that was given for work that has already been performed.  The management of these companies has squandered it.  Now you want to give them more money to squander.  If they could create a new and viable industry, why did they take billions in losses the last couple years instead of doing that?                     If the UAW is dissolved, the US tax payer is on the hook for the pensions.  Collective bargaining is what it is.  All people should have a stick and a carrot when coming to agreement, and the UAW had as big a stick as the Big Three did when they sat down.  They've taken large pay cuts, but they refuse to screw the workers who depend on them for their healthcare and retirement.  These folks paid in to the Union for decades, and the Union is fighting to do right by them.      As far as the market, please refer to the above reply.  A re-org is in order, starting with the insane packages that the C-Level execs have been getting for decades.  How many millions do you need to feel financially secure?  Also, how much is too much to pay someone to ruin your company?  It's not the 26 bucks per hour for the guys on the line that's killing the competitiveness of these companies.  It's the billions in lobbying and lawyering, and the billions in executive salaries for people who suck at their jobs. Also, it's the fact that we, as a nation, force the private sector to fund the nation's healthcare - which no other industrialized nation does to its own private sector.  Hell, the world loves the newest American autos.  That's already been well established.           Quote:                         You still haven't answered the question, how will the jobs you insist will be lost be saved by bridge loans?  Will the auto makers keep buying supplies and paying workers while they don't build cars or will they build cars and just not sell them?                     I hope that the links above help you to see what's really going on in this death struggle between the GOP and the Detroit auto makers.  Senator Shelby of Alabama made the statement yesterday, on the Senate floor, that in his state, the auto industry is thriving.  I almost choked when I heard that.  His efforts garnered billions in US subsidies for Japanese auto makers so that they'd build assembly plants in his state, and now he's fighting the Big Three over a lot less money, and declaring that Alabama's auto industry is healthy, it must be Michigan's fault that the auto industry there is in trouble.      That idiot, if the Big three actually do fail, will need more than a security detail for himself and his family.  It was like watching a guy inject himself with the AIDS virus.  Never saw that kind of thing before.  what the hell could've gotten into that man's mind at that moment, for him to think there'd be no ramifications to that kind of dismissive statement concerning 5 million American jobs.  5 million American homes and families.  Thousands of American businesses and communities.  What kind of hatred must a man have for his own nation to be able to smile and say something like that on behalf of Japanese businessmen?  What kind of future does he and his family have in this nation if it all plays out like he wants it to?      Since the attacks on 9/11, I've stopped thinking that there are events that just can't happen in this country.
