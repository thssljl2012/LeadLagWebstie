  No, it's actually bad for your credit score if you close them yourself.    We just recently closed our Bank of America card because we had TONS of problems with them. And unfortunately, when we decided to refinance our mortgage a couple of weeks ago, the scores had dropped because of this. Grr. I don't really understand this type of arrangement.
