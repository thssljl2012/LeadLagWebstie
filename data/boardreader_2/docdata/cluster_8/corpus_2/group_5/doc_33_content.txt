Alternet: Bank of America&amp;#039;s Greed Sparked Worker&amp;#039;s Strike in Chicago Ref - http://www.alternet.org/story/111149/bank_of_america%27s_greed_sparked_the_eye-opening_worker%27s_strike_in_chicago/ Bank of America, our country&amp;#039;s second largest bank, did indeed take $25 billion dollars of &amp;quot;bailout cash&amp;quot;, then gave the shaft to that company and its workers by refusing to renew and extend it any operating credit to stay in business through the economic downturn. Just close the doors and throw the workers out onto the street without notice in freezing temperatures right before the holidays, Bank of America said, and don&amp;#039;t bother paying them any vacation or severance pay either. Oh, and just cancel everyone&amp;#039;s health insurance while you&amp;#039;re at it. Sorry about those pregnant workers, too. Well, these UE members decided they were NOT going to be put out into the streets like animals, and they would just take over the factor until they got what they had coming to them. This is just simple fairness and self-preservation, but what is happening in Chicago needs to be talked about and actively supported by all working people in this country because you are next. We are all next, if we let Bank of America take our tax-payer money and use it to fatten their profit margin and bottom line . . .
