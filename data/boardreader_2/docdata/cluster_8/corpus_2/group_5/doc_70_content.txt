You're directing your anger at the wrong people..those &amp;quot;tellers&amp;quot; are Main Street people and had nothing to do with this.    Direct your anger at the CEO's and your government officials.  Their pay went up almost 10x what white/blue collar workers got.  They got millions in bonuses and stock options.  We got slashed pensions and the right to fund our own pensions.    Blue or White collar, it doesn't matter..we are all going to pay for the greed of a few at the top.
