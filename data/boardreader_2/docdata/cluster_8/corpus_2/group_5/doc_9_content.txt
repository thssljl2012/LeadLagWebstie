 BofA, AM Ex, Citi, are all doing the same things. Lowering credit limits and increasing interest rates.   I HAD three BofA business cards. When I saw they increased my interest on a card I owed less then half the available credit and never late I called to get it 'fixed'. They fixed me instead! They would not lower the rate and in fact closed the account along with a card I owed ZERO on and a card they just issued with ZERO interest until 2010.   Citibank closed a card that hadn't been used in almost two years. Am Ex lowered credit lines. Even on cards with no balance.
