Have a read through the thread.      Generally credit cards are not widely accepted (they are in hotels, but I didn't notice CC facilities in department stores) and you shouldn't rely on it.      It is a very cash based society. I changed money through CBA but if you are in Sydney, there is a money change that the girls recommend you go to. I can't remember what the name is though
