 Well I never called the police because Bank of America still won't allow me to file a fraud complaint until tomorrow. I'll call them in the morning and find out what all my options are...      It was a debit card used at an ATM in some no name bank. From what I understand, a new debit card has to be activated by either calling in a 1-800# on the back of the card or going to a Bank of America ATM and using the pin number, any other bank and it &amp;quot;shouldn't&amp;quot; be activated. I'll find out from the fraud department tomorrow if I should call the poice or if they will persue it on their own...      The pin # was supposed to have been mailed in a seperate envelope, but if a person has half a brain and works at the post office they've seent this a thousand times and knows what to watch for. Esp. since the 2 envelopes are sent on the same day... genius...
