Apparently no worker should have any benefits. Its only appropriate for the wealthy and the elite to have them. Workers should live in shacks and substandard housing. Oh wait, they already do.     Doesn't anyone understand that the Bush adm and his buddies that are for the rich could care less and they don't want a middle class but only two class,the rich and poor.Why do you think it's ok for the ones in the Senate to get a cost of living increase while the American workers should keep taking cuts?People that have credit cards better pay them off because Citibank received a bail out but will increase their rates even to the best ones with credits once their credit cards are zero to 29% if they want to keep them. All credit cards are going crazy even charging people etc amount of dollars when making a payment on the phone which is goofy and Congress thinks nothing of it.While Wall Street got their money and no one can make Paulson tell who he gave checks to and in what amount these people in Congress want to keep the people's mind on the Big 3 till everything goes down.Wake up America and find out where all this bail out money has gone and to how many CEOs as buy out package deals.
