 I have opened a Commonwealth bank account. I just filled in some forms, and posted them off and voila.      I just need to pop into the branch when I arrive to pick up my cards.      They also opened a transfer account at the same time, where I transfer  into and then they transfer $ into my oz account. They do it at the current exchange rate. As I'm not transfering much money at all to begin with, I'll use that.      When I transfer the rest, I'll use hifx or whoever is best.
