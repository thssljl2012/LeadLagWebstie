Btw Iam, this is happenning against possibly the strongest bank in America right now.      Citi was the worlds biggest bank for some many years before the summer and while JP Morgan and co had stints as the largest (assets wise), everyone became a bank holding company (even raw creditors like Amex) to get in on this financial asset aid.      But as far as liquidity goes, while we can&amp;#039;t compare with European giants like Santander and Lloyds for the moment (and likely the forseeable future) BOA is probably the most structually and financially sound bank in all the continent.      And this is the shit  they&amp;#039;re  getting!!      Imagine if Obama and the Governor had tried rougharming a local small bank in IL? They wouldn&amp;#039;t have had a hope!! At least BoA can hire good lawyers and has a lot of reserves and a lot of public relations workers to sort through all this and steady the troubles!
