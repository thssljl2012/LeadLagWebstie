It's something how these people in the Senate that voted against the Big 3 loan are the same that voted for the $700 billion bail out for Wall Street not asking questions.Now that Paulson received the check and handed the checks out these very same people do not go after him asking questions of who got what and how much for the American People.Many of these Senate's friends are from Wall Street.I'm sure they have that idea  &amp;quot; you take care of my back and I'll take care of yours&amp;quot;.How much did the CEOs of Wall Street get? Bank of America was one that got bailed out but now laying off thousand of people.I'm sure so the CEOs will have more in their pockets.  If Sen Ted Stevens from ALaska is convicted because of corruption even when he's in jail he gets a pensin check of over a thousand a month with increases.It's like screw the American people and you're still rewarded if your in the Senate. All the Senators get cost of living increases while the Amerian Workers take cuts.Times are tough and everyone of those Senators that voted against the loan for the Big 3 ought to take cuts to help the people in their States.  These foreign compaines that build plants here in the USA are paid by taxpayer's dollars along with giving them tax breaks for so many years that the taxpayers have to pay.This is not brought up to the American people.Once those tax breaks are done they will be gone.  Where is our President Bush??He acts like he's already retired and in the locker room with a towel over his shoulder. By the way he and First Lady bought a home in a restricted area in Dallas Texas.Don't know if it's still like that but in this place it was stated that anyone selling a home &amp;quot;can not&amp;quot; sell to black people.This was on MSNBC.
