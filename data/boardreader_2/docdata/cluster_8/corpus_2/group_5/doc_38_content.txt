           They changed the amount of credit that they were willing to extend you based on a very real drop in your credit score and you get insulted and just decide to stop paying. F- You...this is what&amp;#039;s wrong with America.  Honestly it sounds like he really got some bad advice(probably from a realtor)and stopped paying for stuff because it was worth less than he  owed..Which..does ot make a ratass of difference. Those terms are the ones he agreed too.
