            Quote:   wow 20% thats like my first card they gave me in college, b of a sucks, i use usaa for a credit card and they just sent me a notice that I won&amp;#039;t get below 7.75% credit anymore on my card after Feb.   7.75% will be their minimum because they base it on the prime plus which has dipped below 7%. I don&amp;#039;t carry a balance so it doesn&amp;#039;t really matter but i think 7 - 10 is fair.        I&amp;#039;ve been with USAA since I received a learner&amp;#039;s permit and then, my got own policy and c/c.  Probably one of the better insurance, c/c and financial management companies since the late 1950&amp;#039;s.  Never had an issue.  I have a CitiBank personal M/C for my business related charges.  Told thme several months ago I was cancelling as there was an annual charge I was tired of paying for air miles.  They waived the new year&amp;#039;s charge, credited my account for the previous year&amp;#039;s charge and keep awarding me air miles.  I love buying United tickets on the M/C and getting American A/L miles along with United miles.  It is my goal in life not to fly American again.  Ever.  Hi-jack, sorry...
