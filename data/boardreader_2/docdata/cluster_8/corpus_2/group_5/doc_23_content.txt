I&amp;#039;d go with the car.       We had about 10 active cards, maybe more... with mostly 500-1000, and 2 above 3000. We took our tax return and paid off the smaller ones. Which felt really good. All of our interest rates are high (mostly near 20% and above).   But now we have only 11,000 left all around. And no matter what, I don&amp;#039;t change the minimum amount I send, and try to do more at the end of the month. Soon enough those 100 min payments are down to 60$, and if you&amp;#039;ve always sent say 150 a month, that&amp;#039;s 90$ more going towards the actual debt, not just interest.       I also do some shuffeling some of the time. Bank of America likes to do 6-9month promotions for balance transfers for like 5%. Unlike those 0% interest for 6 months or a year, the interest doesn&amp;#039;t compound over the time, and anything not paid off just goes into the regular interest rate. So for those 9 months, I have a lower interest rate.       Once I get a card below a 1,000 I focus on getting it paid off completely by sending them everything I got.
