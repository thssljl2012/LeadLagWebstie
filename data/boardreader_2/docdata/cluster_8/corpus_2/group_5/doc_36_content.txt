         The banks are cutting losses right now. You&amp;#039;re &amp;quot;lucky&amp;quot; they didn&amp;#039;t cut your limit to next to nothing. That&amp;#039;s what they are doing to most right now.   My business is selling to other small businesses and 100% of my clients pay their initial fee and ongoing monthly fees with credit cards. The amount of people calling to switch their payment cards is staggering. The story always the same.. their limit got cut from $20,000 down to $1000 or less for no apparent reason. Always paid on time, etc. In many cases as soon as they pay down some money owed the bank cuts the limit to what is remaining on the card, essentially shutting their credit off completely.  The banks aren&amp;#039;t taking the risks of giving credit anymore without sufficient reward. It&amp;#039;s ugly and it sucks but it&amp;#039;s the new reality.
