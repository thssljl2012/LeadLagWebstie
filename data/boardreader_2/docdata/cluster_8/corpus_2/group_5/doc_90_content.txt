We purchased a home back in 2006 when the market is still hot. The value of our house dropped by 120K. We have excellent credit scores, and we do not want to go through foreclosures. We don&amp;#039;t want to ruin our credit history. Our plan is buy a new house (take advantage of the lower rates and lower price of houses), and declare the existing house as a rental property. We did found someone who would want to rent our existing house for $2,700.       Is there hope for us? Anyone knows a bank who would gives us a chance to take a new loan? Bank of America says no to us already.
