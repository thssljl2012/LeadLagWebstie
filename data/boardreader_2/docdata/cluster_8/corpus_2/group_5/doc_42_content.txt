         wow 20% thats like my first card they gave me in college, b of a sucks, i use usaa for a credit card and they just sent me a notice that I won&amp;#039;t get below 7.75% credit anymore on my card after Feb.   7.75% will be their minimum because they base it on the prime plus which has dipped below 7%. I don&amp;#039;t carry a balance so it doesn&amp;#039;t really matter but i think 7 - 10 is fair.
