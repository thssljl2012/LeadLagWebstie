           as they only quote one historical rate for the day is that not like saying the closing price for BP shares was 5 but I was charged 5.25 in the morning so my broker has done a bad job.     I&amp;#039;m not sure, but I think the card companies will probably use the same rate for the whole of the day (the conversion is likely to happen as part of some sort of overnight batch process rather than in real time).
