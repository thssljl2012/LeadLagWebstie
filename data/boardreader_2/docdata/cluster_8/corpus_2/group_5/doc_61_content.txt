Answer me this. Why would Bank of America loan money to pay for vacation to these workers when the company is shutting down? The banks only make loans to people who pay them back. But I have a feelin that nobody really cares what the governor thinks anymore. If I got laid off I would spend my time looking for another job. And thats what I did when it happened to me I got another job.
