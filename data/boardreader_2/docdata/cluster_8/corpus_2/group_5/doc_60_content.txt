Like the governor said, Bank of America was given money precisely to handle situations like this and Bank of America has refused to loan money to pay the workers that are owed the money. I am glad the state of Illinois is going to boycott Bank of America if they do not come through. We need more governors like this. I'm afraid that in many states, the governors would have just sent in the cops or the National Guard, if the workers refused to leave and would have made it all a &amp;quot;national security&amp;quot; issue. Only to reaffirm it is okay to steal from American labor and taxpayers. WTG State of Illinois.     Yeah, that illinois governor is a real &amp;quot;hero&amp;quot; isn't he. What a guy. Lets see how much time he does in prison.
