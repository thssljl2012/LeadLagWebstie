 How quickly has Bank of America been converting 10k miles to EQMs after the $25k spent threshold has passed?      I passed the $25k point by a decent amount with my December statement, and when I add up the miles added to my account over the past year, it comes out to well over 25k miles of &amp;quot;everyday purchases&amp;quot; excluding bonuses for USAir purchases. Don't see 10k converted over to preferred yet.      Main reason I care is that if it hits before the end of the year, that'll be enough to bump me into Gold, and I might have a chance at upgrades compared to my dismal year as Silver.
