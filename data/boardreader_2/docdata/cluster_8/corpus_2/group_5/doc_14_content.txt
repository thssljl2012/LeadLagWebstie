          I&amp;#039;m not sure, but I think the card companies will probably use the same rate for the whole of the day (the conversion is likely to happen as part of some sort of overnight batch process rather than in real time).    I have used my card twice in the same day and seen this on my statement with 2 different rates? So in the case of NatWest they do not set the rate for the day. Unless of course the 2 transactions were presented on 2 different days of course, which could happen.  Raptor.
