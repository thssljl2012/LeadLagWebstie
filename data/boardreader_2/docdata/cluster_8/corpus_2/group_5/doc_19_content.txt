ok tcope how about this i know your stance is we should take the stuff out in the order that it is done.   say u have some debit card purchases coming through thats not gonna overdraw you but wait uhoh this check u wrote 3 days ago gets presented to us at the bank how would u like us to process that? or how about u go out and make transactions on your debit card overdrawing your account but u make a cash deposit that same evening befor cutoff time. now how would u like us to process that almighty tcope? that is why we have the posting order as it is to many variables and it makes the most sense when u actually think about it. u do know that we wont pay every single item rite? what if u have 5 or 6 100 dollar purchases coming through on the same day your 600 dollar mortgage payment is coming out and we cover the 5 or 6 single 100 dollar transactions but return your mortgage? wouldnt like that much would you? so we may be bending u over without lube at the current rate but etleast were not gang banging you.
