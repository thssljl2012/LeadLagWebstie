         I am banker for a large retail bank and I know that credit cards to do not come with a fix rate for long term. The card could of had a lower rate as promotion for like a year or two and then it goes back to a variable rate . Your best bet is to do a balance transfer to a card with a lower rate. Plus, B of A is hurting right now. peace
