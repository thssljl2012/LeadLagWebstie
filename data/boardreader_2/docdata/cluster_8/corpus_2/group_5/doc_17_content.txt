         We use Nationwide to send money to our son in Oz.   Out of the last 4 transfers only one is about 2.5% lower than we expected, the rest very much around the  xe.com  rate, but as they only quote one historical rate for the day is that not like saying the closing price for BP shares was 5 but I was charged 5.25 in the morning so my broker has done a bad job.
