Receive my check on 12-6-2008, i deposit the check at Bank of America on 12-8 the bank. They say 4900.00 was going to be avail. on 12-10 and the reset on 12-15. i check and is was there on the 12-10. on the next day they pull the money back and told me that the check was being sent back in the mail and the reason why it was being sent back. i was like OMG!!! I got on the phone and call the 877-827-7744(which is located in Jamaica) payroll number and they would investigate it and let me know by 12-15. That was not good enough for me so i call the bank back and they told me they had to extend the hold date until 12-23. This is really sad right now i have a check in bank but has not clear yet. good luck everyone. And now this bailout mess is really holding things up. Right now all i want for Xmas is my money.     Bank of America is one of the banks that got the buyout.Also the recent scandel in Chicago with the factory union workers doing the sit-in when the co. gave 3 days notice that the factory was closing was thru bank of america. Factory workers just got their money from that bank.
