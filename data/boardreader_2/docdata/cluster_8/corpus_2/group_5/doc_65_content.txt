      Well Bank of America will be laying off those people over the next three years...not today. Who knows that will happen in three years...just more to scare people. Someone on the news yesterday said if GM and the others would offer a big rebate...say $7000 on the cars sitting on the lots now, maybe some could afford a new car. There are like 250,000 unsold new cars just sitting right now.  I for one hate to see workers lose jobs, but I don't think the auto bail out is the solution. It would only give them like three months and then what? A bigger bail out? This bail out was for the UAW no one else.
