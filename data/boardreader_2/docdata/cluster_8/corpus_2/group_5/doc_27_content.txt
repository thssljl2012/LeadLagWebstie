   I read today that the company will not remain solvent even with the line of credit- which tells you something why Bank of America (one of the few solvent banks left) isn&amp;#039;t willing to extend credit to the company.       Of course you full well know, that the part about the company not remaining solvent anyway will not be reported tonight on the evening news.       What will follow is the usual suspects(politicians) pontificating about outrageous and unconscionable CEO pay packages, and banks getting bailout money not freeing up credit; as the cause for the business failing. BoA and it&amp;#039;s executives will get hauled in front of the Senate committee and the cast of baffoons will turn it into a circus.      But I digress.
