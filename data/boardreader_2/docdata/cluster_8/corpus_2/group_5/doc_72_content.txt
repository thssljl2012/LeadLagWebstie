             Quote:   Right. Let's start by paying all labor in America slave and poverty -level wages. That'll really get his country up and running again.           This statement is bogus.  There are plenty of people in this country who wished they earned $44.00 an hour.        Quote:    What is union pork? Skilled workers earning more than peanuts? Health benefits? Pensions? Vacation or sick time?          Yes while true a large portion of the union work force is skilled and works a large portion looks to get out of work and collect unmployment and workers comp while working on their side jobs.   As well the union pork coming from the inflated salaries goes to the union management, christmas parties, and protecting the workers who drink do drugs on the job and do shoddy work from being fired.        Quote:   They were doing poorly for years. The only thiong that kept them afloat was hopeless speculation.          Until they opened up their plants here while the big three opened up plants out of the country.   The only hopeless speculation was allowing the big three to get so far behind in debt that they are seeking a bailout to support an out of touch work force that does not get the fact that the company needs to be competetive with other companies and with employees and management receiving such absurd wages they do not have a chance nor should they get any tax money to keep them floating for a few weeks just to come back.  Both union and managment must reduce their liabilities to their company.  If not the company should be allowed to hire non union less expesive help as well as lose its board of directors for a more reasonable managment.        Quote:    business plan has to change or just quite and it is not the one in the black.    The bank bailout would have gone much further if the bailout went directly to those in forclosure and just paid their loans off of made a partical payments and allowed those people to refiniance a lower balance at a lower interest rate.           Last I heard, the 35 billion went to Bank of America and they're still laying off 35,000. The bailout money isn't going to workers. Nor is it going to supply credit as well it should have never happened.      -------------------- ABILITY is what you're capable of doing  ATTITUDE determines how well you do it
