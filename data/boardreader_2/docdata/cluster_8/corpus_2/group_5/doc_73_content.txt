Opened bank account end October with Bank of America. Have been looking at getting a car loan- but have been cut off from every angle, like - need US proof of ID in one; 5 year credit history in an other place, etc.       I feel very stuck and frustrated... I have a job contract that i have not started yet, as cant drive there. But its a very solid salary long term contract. I have great credit history in the UK.       Is there are really no place/bank/lender i can apply in my position???    Is there any world banks here apart from HSBC, that have branches in UK and US??   I mean in 21st century, and we cant get a  loan between UK and US?!!   Any advise at is greatly appreciated.    Thanks for your time!                          Hi:      See if you can join a credit union.
