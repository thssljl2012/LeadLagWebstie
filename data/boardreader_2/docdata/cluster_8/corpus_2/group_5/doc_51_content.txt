            Quote:   Throw Wells Fargo in there as well. They&amp;#039;ve been hittin&amp;#039; me with &amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot; charges. The kook on the phone was the most unprofessional, rudest prick I&amp;#039;ve ever talked to. Raised his voice at me and that was all it took.  Told him to go fvck himself and hung up on him. Closing my account today. STAY AWAY FROM WELLS FARGO!!!   Time to start stuffing a matress.           closed my BofA credit card when I found out they sold my account info to a &amp;quot;travel marketing&amp;quot; company.  had a zero balance for a couple months then these random $120 charges would show up.  inquired w/ BofA about the charges and the guy on the phone flat out told me they did some type of marketing promotion w/ what turned out to be a scam artist.  Fuk BofA for taking those ad $&amp;#039;s in exchange for my account#, doing no due diligence on who it sells information to, not telling their customers about the fraud potential, and participating in the fraud      --------------------  What Doing?
