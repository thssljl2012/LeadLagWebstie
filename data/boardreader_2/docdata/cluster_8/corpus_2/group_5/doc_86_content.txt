 So apparently some a-hole got a hold of my check card number, created a counterfeit card, and tried to charge $300 on it at a Dillard's in Florida.  I must say though, Bank of America was right on top of things.  They rejected the transaction and immediately sent me an email saying they saw a suspicious transaction.  I called them and they canceled the check card.  They handled it well, just sucks that I'll be without a friggin check card for nearly a week right at Christmas time.
