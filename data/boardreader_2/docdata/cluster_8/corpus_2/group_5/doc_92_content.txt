Overall, I've been pleased with Bank of America, but I would agree that their practices seem optimized to encourage overdrafts.  I've basically learned to keep much more money in my accounts than I'm going to need.    The worst example was from cashing online-issued Bank of America checks.  I receive a lot of these checks issued from Bank of America's online Billpay feature.  You'd think that since this is an official check, issued by the bank itself, being deposited into another Bank of America account, that I would have access to the funds immediately.  But, for some reason, the checks would frequently indicate that they were being drawn from a Fifth Third bank in Ohio.  Since that's an out-of-state bank, my bank would place a one-week hold on the checks.  Thankfully, this issue has since been resolved.    On a positive note, in Bank of America's favor, I have my checking accounts connected to a savings account with overdraft protection.  And if I see a pending charge online that has triggered an overdraft, I am able to transfer the funds immediately to cover it, which nullifies any overdrafts and fees.
