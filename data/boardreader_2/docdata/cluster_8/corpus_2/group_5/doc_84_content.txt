I live in Japan, and I use my debit card only to get money out of my bank of america account, but I am soon going to leave that alone and use it solely for my softbank bill, and the finish paying off a credit card ($50 left :D ). THough my reason for it was to pay for my fees and books which overall was $750. That was of course a year ago. Since then because I payed regularly my credit rating went up. I only use my 1 credit card for emergencies, and right now I left that behind in America. And I have a part-time job here in Japan, and so I am at the point where I am not depending on money from my accounts back at home. Also Japan is a cash society so a 20 yr old such as myself haven't ran into any real problems so far :)
