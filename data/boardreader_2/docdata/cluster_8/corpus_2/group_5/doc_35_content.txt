         I don&amp;#039;t make late payments.   I just found out &amp;quot;change in credit circumstances&amp;quot; includes taking out a business equipment loan at another bank. Using a chunk of unused credit you were already given, but weren&amp;#039;t using, can make your credit score drop and activate all the fine print on all your credit cards.  Turns out it&amp;#039;s better to go to a new source of credit, rather than using unused credit you already have.  My score must have cratered all the way down to 780!  what the hell sense does that make??????
