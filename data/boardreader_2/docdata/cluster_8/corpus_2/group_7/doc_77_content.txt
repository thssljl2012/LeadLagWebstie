 We generally use a 4 digit pin number entered into a little machine at the till rather than sign. You can still sign in most places, but it lessens the security.            If you can get a 4 digit pin number in respect of you cards before you go, it will smooth your way and speed up your transactions.            -----------------------            US-issued credit cards do not contain the microchip that UK and European card readers expect for a PIN-based transaction. You can see the difference when a salesperson or server inserts just one end of the card into the card reader - with US cards, nothing happens. While it may be possible to obtain a 4-digit PIN for a US-issued credit card, the card will probably still have to be used as swipe-and-sign.            However, anyone planning to use an *ATM* card in the UK should make sure to have a 4-digit PIN for it. Some banks here (including Bank of America, whose ATM cards are accepted with no fee at Barclays ATMs) routinely issue 6-digit PINs.
