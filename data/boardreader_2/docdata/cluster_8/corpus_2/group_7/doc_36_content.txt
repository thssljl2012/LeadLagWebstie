Talk to the B of A operator, explain the situation she will argue she can&#039;t do anything about it but maybe take only one fee off.  ask for the supervisor and say you don&#039;t understand why so many charges have been given, and that you will not be able to pay for things you need.  tell the supervisor that you can pay half the fees and if they can take off the rest.  If you haven&#039;t done this before they may just do it for you.  If they can&#039;t, ask if you can defer the fees to 2 payments.  Good luck!  the most that has been done for me is taking one fee away.  They only take the fees away if it was the banks fault.  Having a status of a long period and good customer you get a little more cooperation from them.  Make sure to speak to operator first then ask for supervisor.
