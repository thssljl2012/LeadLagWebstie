Why is it that Citi and Bank of America (I'm sure along with other Banks) are still charging Americans 30% interest on Credit Cards (for regular rates as well as default rates), when they got TARP money.       How is it that the Government would allow them to get TARP $$ without some provision protecting Americans from ridiculous interest rates?     What is this country coming to?  I am trying to stay positive.     _______________________________   http://www.TonySullivanMinistries.net    http://www.ChildrenOfGodClothing.com
