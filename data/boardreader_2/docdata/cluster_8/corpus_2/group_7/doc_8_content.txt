         I have only 2 credit cards, both with Citibank. One is the oldest credit card I have, which I keep open for the longer credit history and use for 1 small purchase every 6 months (I'll probably up that to quarterly). The other is a Citibank cash back credit card that I put almost all my monthly expenses on and pay off in full each month.  But every now and then in the news I read something about how Citibank isn't doing so well. If they were to fail, would they most likely be bought by another bank, and would that include their credit card business? Or is it possible their credit card business could be closed, and if so should I get a credit card with another company just in case? My FICO scores are in the 790's, so getting approved shouldn't be an issue.
