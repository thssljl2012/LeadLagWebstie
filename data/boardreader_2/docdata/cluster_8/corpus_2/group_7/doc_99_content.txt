It depends on the credit evaluator.      But you know how Citibank is having tough times in the US so maybe this is why they're cracking down. A lot of poeple lie about their income hehe.      AMEX is also pretty strict in the US, they aren't too bad in Canada but they have started to cut credit lines here. In the US they do random financial reviews and you have to send in up to like a year of paystubs or the last few years of tax returns showing income.      TD also seemed to tighten up as well, I applied for a First Class VISA and a credit guy called back and asked like a million questions. He also said that he might require paystubs to be sent in as well.      BMO now requires 2 pieces of ID to be validated when applying. If they apply online and are approved they may be sent to a branch before they can activate to verify ID (2 Pieces).
