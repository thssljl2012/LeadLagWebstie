 Edited on Thu Feb-19-09 08:53 PM by SpartanDem         While Obama's team did put a $500,000 annual cap on cash paid to the CEO, the restriction does not apply to Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and about 350 other banks that've already grabbed bailout funds. It only applies to those taking money in the next phase of the giveaway.   The cap in the legislation that was signed is retroactive so this column beyond ill informed.
