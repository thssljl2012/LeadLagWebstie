yeah I got a ton of offers too; fortunately I wasn't 18 yet when I started college so I had a legitimate excuse not to get one. I still get stuff from citibank all the time. I have one credit card that I use infrequently (it's mostly for emergencies). I usually just use my debit. But I definitely know that I have to pay off that money at some point! And I have run it up to the $750 limit before too, which sucks but happens. (I paid it off with my scholarship money refund check)
