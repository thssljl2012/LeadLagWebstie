My Chase Visa didn't charge any fee.                Guess I'm going to have to call my cc companies and check on this.  Only use my card for hotel and car but still...why pay the extra fee if you don't have to.  I have a Chase Visa and Citibank Mastercard so we'll see what they say.....   _________________   ~Amy~
