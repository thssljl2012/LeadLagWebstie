It sounds like some of those charges actually hit your account prior to your check being credited which I assume is why you did expect $70.  If there are 10 debits and 1 credit on the same day, the end of day should count the deposit before debiting any money.  You should review your account post-check deposit.  It sounds like it could possibly be a timing issue and as a former BoA teller, I saw this a lot.        One main problem was that people would spend money Feb 12th expecting the deposit to happen at 12am later that day.  The issue arises that 12am later that day is actually Feb 13th, not Feb. 12th.  Therefore, when all the transactions tie out at the end of the day, your debits hit your account before your check got deposited.  If your online/paper statement shows the check deposit and the transactions happeneing on the same day, you could argue that the bank didn&#039;t utilize the deposit first which is what is typically done.        They could have changed their policies since I&#039;ve left, but they should have counted your check deposit first before finalizing all your debits.
