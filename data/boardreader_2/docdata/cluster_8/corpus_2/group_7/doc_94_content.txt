         During my last visit to the UK in November 2008 I opened a current account with HSBC in Kensington. I had a recent bank statement from natwest with my Luxembourg address on and my British passport. No problem to open the account. Since when I have transferred some funds and opened with  internet banking  a  savings account  with them. I suspect that the Kensington branch is quite used to "foreigners" opening accounts. I wonder if it would have been as simple in Leicester where I was born.
