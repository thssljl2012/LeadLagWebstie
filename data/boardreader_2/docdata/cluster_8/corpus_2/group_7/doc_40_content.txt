 Edited on Thu Feb-12-09 07:57 PM by keepCAblue         This is disgusting....     One of the biggest causes of the financial crisis was that Americans were borrowing (and spending) more money than they could afford to pay back.  So how are credit-card issuers reacting to consumers' attempts to live a more financially responsible lifestyle? They're threatening to cut their credit cards off if they don't spend enough.  Loretta Maxwell of Troy, Mich., thought her credit score of 790 buffered her against most of the fallout of the credit crunch. When Chase (JPM) closed her $6,000-limit card in December without warning after two years of inactivity, she called to fight it. She was unsuccessful. "If you're not using it, they entice you to do so, and then the moment you don't spend enough, they cut your limit," she says. (Chase says it is standard practice is to review inactive accounts. "Inactive cards with large open credit lines present a real risk of fraudulent use and large potential liabilities for Chase," says spokeswoman Stephanie Jacobson.)  Maxwell's experience is far from an isolated incident. Most major issuers, including Chase, Bank of America (BAC), American Express (AXP) and Citibank (C) have been slashing credit lines and closing the accounts of those who don't spend on their card regularly. While these issuers are required to notify you in writing of an account closing, there's no requirement that they do so in advance. Even when they do give early notice, the only way a cardholder can stop their account from getting shut down is to start spending again.

How can Experian get away with this? Doesn't this violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act?    Key Credit Score to Be Hidden From Consumers     Q: Is there any way I can get my FICO score thats based on Experians data?  After Feb. 13, no.  Q: What will I be getting when I go to MyFICO.com?  Fair Isaac says it will continue to sell scores at MyFICO.com based on data from Equifax and TransUnion. Its FICO Credit Complete, which offers FICO scores based on data from each of the three bureaus for $47.85 ($42.84 with annual renewal), will no longer be available, however. Fair Isaac may start offering new packages, but pricing for individual scores wont change, says Craig Watts, a spokesman for Fair Isaac.  Spokesmen for Equifax and TransUnion say neither bureau has plans to follow in Experians footsteps.  Q: Will this affect my ability to secure new credit?  Possibly. While you wont be able to see the FICO score that uses Experians data, lenders can still pull it -- and so may make a decision based on information you cant see. Basically, there is no way to be certain that you know which data the lender is basing its decision on. Henson says the scores consumers see, even at MyFICO.com, are educational ones. They are not necessarily by any means the scores lenders are using, she says.   MORE AT LINK:  http://www.smartmoney.com/spending/deals/key-credit-sco...  /
