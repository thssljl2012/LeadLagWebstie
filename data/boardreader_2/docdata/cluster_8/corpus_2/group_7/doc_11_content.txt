 It's probably a wash.  Bank of America charges all WellsFargo account holders to use its ATMs while WF charges all BoA account holders right back.   So all the banks are stiffing non-customers with fees.         USAA is a tricky matter since they don't have alot of ATMs.  In SanAntonio they probably charge $50 for non-USAA members to use the few ATMs they have there.          But think about it:  If you are sophisticated enough to want to use an online-only bank, then you are probably not the type that needs to run to the ATM every day or week.
