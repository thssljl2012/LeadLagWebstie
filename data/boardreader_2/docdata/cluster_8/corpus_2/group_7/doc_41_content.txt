Under legislation introduced yesterday, companies such as Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and American Express Co. would be limited in the kinds of fees they can charge. The bill would ban unilateral changes to credit-card agreements and retroactive interest rate increases.  At a time when our economy is in a crisis and consumers are struggling financially, credit-card companies in too many cases are gouging them, hiking interest rates on customers who pay on time and consistently meet the terms of their credit-card agreements, Dodd said at a Washington hearing today.  snip  Dodds legislation, introduced with Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, would prevent any-time, any reason rate increases, according to a bill summary. It would require that interest rate changes only apply to future debt. And it would allow customers who close their accounts to pay under their existing terms. A similar bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives.  Lawmakers considering further credit-card restrictions should first study how the Feds regulations are working, said Senator Richard Shelby, the panels senior Republican. The banking industry is already drastically altering credit-card agreements, he said.  Read more:  http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=awN...                          ...
