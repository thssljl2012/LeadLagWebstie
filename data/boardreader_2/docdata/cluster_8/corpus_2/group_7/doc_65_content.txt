 There is a Santender ATM at the AP between the arrivals and departures area. There is also a Santender on 10 AV and Calle 3. For those people who have Bank of America accounts there will be no charge for using these ATMs. It will say there is a 7.5 peso fee, but when you get your statement there will be none.
