Another option is a secured credit card.  I know Bank of America offers one, and I'm sure others do, too.  You put a few hundred dollars down as a deposit ($300 was the minimum when I did this) and that becomes your credit limit.  The advantages are that this is relatively easy to get for someone who doesn't have a credit history, since there is no risk to the card issuer, and you don't have to worry about ringing up huge balances.  The disadvantage is that you have to give the bank a few hundred dollars, which doesn't accrue interest.  They also often have an annual fee.  Typically you get the deposit back after about a year when the bank decides that you aren't a credit risk, and at that point you can take the opportunity to get a different card that doesn't have an annual fee.        Getting a credit card as a student is probably a more straightforward approach, but I didn't get a credit card until I was out of college, so the secured card route was pretty much the only one open to me.
