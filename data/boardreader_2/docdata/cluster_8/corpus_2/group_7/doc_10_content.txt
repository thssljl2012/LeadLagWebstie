So all the banks are stiffing non-customers with fees.             It's true that it's probably a wash, and that in the aggregate, it can't be costing banks *any* money.  However, from an individual bank's perspective, they have an incentive to increase the volume of fees charged at their ATMs, and reduce the volume of fees that they're responsible for at other banks.  I imagine they just consider the fee rebates a relatively cheap part of the cost of doing business.
