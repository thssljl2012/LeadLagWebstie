I just talked to them again, trying your advice of speaking to a supervisor.  This is exactly what she told me:    "While it does look like you have a point in that some of these fees shouldn't exist, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do."    ARE YOU ****ING KIDDING ME?  What kind of BS line is that?!
