         Stockbuyer2,    I have noticed that Chase is becoming more and more difficult to do 0% BTs with. I guess everyone is these days...     You may have better luck with Citibank or Capital One. Citibank charged me a fee for my last BT, but it was capped at $75. Capital One did not charge me a fee for my recent BT to them.  Lockmama
