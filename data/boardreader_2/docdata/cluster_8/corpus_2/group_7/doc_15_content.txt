  Ok my first update!!I couldn't wait for the bank of america statement but the finance charges will be minimal. I did transfer my Cap One balance to my bank of america card which I had paid off before joining the group. The interest was an extra 143.46 to my total but I didnt add the interest in since I paid that amount in my payment this month. I am so proud of myself an can't wait until next month. Debtless Divas you got your work cut out for you. Just kidding!!Hope everyone is having a great day!!             Debt   1/7/2009
