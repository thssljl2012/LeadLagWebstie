 We just had the worst problem with Citibank too. We have NEVER been late and always pay 3 or 4 times the minimum balance or just pay it off every month. We received our new statement and our interest rate went up 5%!!!!!!!!!!! We tried to call them and the only answer was, "The credit market is terrible...sorry. We can close your card right now". So, we opened up a Discover card (0%) and are no longer using Citibank!!!!     This is TERRIBLE!!!
