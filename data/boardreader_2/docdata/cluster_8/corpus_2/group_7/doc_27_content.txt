So I went down to the local branch and talked to the manager.  She said she understood my case, and that she was going to look into reversing those fees.    And then she gets on her computer, and realizes that the last customer service lady that I talked to "decisioned" my account, meaning that her decision about my fees was final and no one below her could go in and reverse them.  So apparently even the branch manager didn't have the authority to overrule customer service.  Seriously???    The manager gave me a different department to call, and said they should be able to help me.  So I call, talk to this lady on the phone, and she's giving me the exact same spiel that I got before.  There's nothing they can do, yada yada yada.  However, I refuse to end the conversation.  When she asked if there was anything else, I just kept going back to it and bringing it all up again.  Eventually she put me on hold for a few minutes, and when she came back, she told me that they were going to reverse TWO of four fees.  Why in the world wouldn't they reverse the rest?  She wouldn't tell me, but stuff like that just reeks of "Yeah, you're definitely right and this is our way of saying sorry while not giving you all of your money back."    So I'm a little better off, but still about 80 dollars in the hole.  What a frustrating afternoon.    And Steve, that's EXACTLY what they did that caused all of this in the first place.  It's so wrong, but yet they get away with it!
