 Edited on Thu Feb-19-09 10:16 AM by aikoaiko         I feel your pain though. I used to bank at Bank of America.  My wife didn't understand the overdraft terms and purchased a couple of small items all under $10 and got hit with 25 and 30 dollar fees EACH.  I tried to talk to BoA and they are unconcerned and unresponsive.   So now we do all our banking at Wachovia where if you go over any amount it rounds up to the nearest $100 for a $10 fee plus APR.  Those terms are much more reasonable.                                         Donate to DU and give valentine hearts to your friends!  Click here.
