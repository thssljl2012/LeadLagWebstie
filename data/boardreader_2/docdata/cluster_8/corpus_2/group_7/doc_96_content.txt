When I first moved here I had no credit history being Canadian, and the only bank that had a policy of calling Canada to check my previous credit was Bank of America. My office has an arrangement with Citibank to give us bank accounts even before we got our Social Security #s.  Eventually I built up sufficient credit to get a Chase Amazon Visa card (which I signed up to make $30 back on a friend's $500+ amazon order).  Now I am moving everything to Charles Schwab, as they have my brokerage, and a Checking Account as well, I am closing my Citibank (Schwab pays you back any ATM fees having no ATMs themselves), and I just prefer their web site's robustness compared to Citi or BOA.  Question: I will now have 3 credit cards (and a American Express charge card from work). I don't need or want 3 credit cards. I will use the Schwab day to day, the Chase solely for Amazon purchases and the Amex for work and business trips.  Is there any downside to canceling the BOA card? Will it affect my credit? Better to just cut it up?  BOA also calls a lot to offer me credit protection which is annoying.
