 Citibank increased ALL rates on some classes of card as of February 1. I received a letter in October that they would be changing my rate from prime+5% to 16.99%. That in fact happened on February 1. Small balance on the card (less than $300 out of $25,000 credit line), no late payments, nothing, and I've had the card since 1992. I called and they offered the following deal: reduce back to prime+5%, but then the card will close on the currently printed expiration date. I was flabbergasted, and refused that deal. Then, looking over my totally clean credit, the guy reduced me to prime+10.99 (i.e., 14.24%), and again, for no reason whatsoever other than their internal difficulties. He asked me if I wanted that instead of 16.99%, and I laughed and said, well, yes, I'd prefer 14.24% to 16.99%, since I'm not a fucking idiot.    Mind you, we have no debt other than the small balance we carry on that card from time to time, which never exceeds 2-3% of our available credit, and our credit score, especially given our huge available credit, is pretty much perfect. The interest rate spike at Citi is, as far as i can tell, arbitrary with respect to credit risk, and utterly determined by some internal policy shift. I suspect that in my case they're trying to get me to close the card because I have such a huge available credit line, which probably counts something against their books in mark-to-market. I was certainly being incentivized to close the account.
