As for the NSF/Oerdraft fees...the guy who came up with that is a really smart guy. What they did in...2007 I think, is change from listing transactions in the order they were authorized to the order of their amount. So it used to be if you had $20 in your account and used your debit card and made 19 $1 transactions in a row bringing your balance down to $1, and then you ran one more transaction for $21 bringing your account balance down to -$20, you would get one NSF/OD fee. Now they have it set up so that the $21 would post first and then each of the 19 $1 transactions would rack up their own NSF/OD fee.    Just plain wrong.  That shouldn't be legal.
