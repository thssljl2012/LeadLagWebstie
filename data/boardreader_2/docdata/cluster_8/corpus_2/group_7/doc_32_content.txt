  What is important to note here is that Experian will no longer allow consumers to access a score that lenders, banks, credit card companies and third-party collectors will continue to access.      In a time when you should know the "real" credit score that lenders use, Experian wants to sell us scores that virtually no creditors use, aka FAKO scores. They know they can make more money selling these FAKO scores that no creditors use because most consumers don't know this.      Lets face it, we can talk all we want about about not using credit and paying cash for everthing, but this doesn't apply to everyone. Very few of us can buy a house without some financing.     Also, in a time when we need transparency with everything, Experian sees it fit to keep a very important piece of information about us top secret. And, its all in an attempt to make $$$. It sounds all to familiar today, doesn't it.     So, how do I to protest this Experian BS?     -I cancelled my credit monitoring service through Experian. I used to monitor my reports to prevent ID theft. I never paid any attention to FAKO scores they gave me. If I needed to apply for credit, which I rarely do, I would pull my FICO scores before applying and I always knew where I stood.     - Freeze my Experian report. If I don't know my Experian score, neither are any creditors.     - I will stop doing busines with "Experian lovers" like American Express, Bank of America, FIA, Macy's
