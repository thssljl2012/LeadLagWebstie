 Edited on Wed Feb-04-09 12:46 PM by SoCalDem         Now if I used my Provident bank debit card to get cash at Bank of America, they might BOTH charge me, but I only use it for PURCHASES..instead of writing a check or usiing cash..  Even when I use it at a restaurant that does not have a "put your pin number in" machine, I am never charged "extra" by the restaurant or the bank..  I bank online to pay bills, and am not charged for that either..  I love the "checkless" economy    These cards are a blessing for most merchants..if you don;t have the money, the transaction cannot proceed, so it saves them the hassle of trying to collect for bad checks, and by having the ability to use the debit cards, they can easily post signs that say NO CHECKS..  Even if it costs the merchants a little per transaction, I'm sure most merchats are savvy enough to build in a price increase to cover it...and then they make even more when people pay cash..
