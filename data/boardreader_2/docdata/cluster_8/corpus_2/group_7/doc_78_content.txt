 Bank of America when they merged. I had MBNA for about a million years and never had cause to complain.  I have had no problem with B of A but do not trust them not to start playing around. The new envelope deal is annoying, next think, they will start charging if you pay by mail.  I wish I could just switch to another company but now that I am unemployed, I cannot ever get another card with just SS income.  I'm stuck. My husband dumped his AX card years ago when he finally realized that giving them $50.00 a year in order to give them even more money was rather counter productive. You had to pay in full every month so what was the point?
