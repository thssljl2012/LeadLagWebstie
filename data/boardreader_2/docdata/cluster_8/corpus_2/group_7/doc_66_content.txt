 Oh man where do i start....I did the overdraft thing (nothing ticks me off more)on my bank causing 175 in fees. (Bank of America will get u on overdraft bad!!) It overdrafting caused my rent check to bounce causing 200 in late fees to the apartment. I went to the mall the other day and bought my new makeup MAC costed me $65...yeah well by the time i got to my car I couldn't find the MAC bag anywhere. I guess I dropped it or set it down or something so I had to run back in and re-buy the DAM STUFF!! I was a emotional wreck that day. Over 400 dollars there. Then I realized I hadn't paid the gas bill in over 4 months lol (im not used to paying gas) so had to throw 125 on that. when does it end??????????????
