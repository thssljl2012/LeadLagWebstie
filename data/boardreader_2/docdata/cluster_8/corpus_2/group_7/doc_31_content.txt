         I tried to withdraw $300 from a Bank of America ATM in Chicago on Tuesday last week using my UK Maestro (debit) card. I've used the same card successfully for overseas cash withdrawals all around the world.  The ATM terminated the transaction (or so the the screen said) just when I expected money to come out and didn't give any sort of paper receipt detailing what happened.  I called my bank there &amp; then (First Direct, part of HSBC) who said that they had approved the transaction so it wasn't terminated because of them.  Anyway I managed to get cash from another machine using another card.  On my return the bank sent a note saying that BoA had debited my account as though the transaction had progressed normally.  However they are chasing it up and expect it to be rectified "in a few days".  Has anyone else had a similar experience, and if so how long is "a few days" likely to be?   FH
