a few things about BofA    1. This is why they are still in business and WAMU is out...all these damn fees        2. I've evaded 20+ overdraft fees.  I either say 1. I'm a broke college student and I cant afford these and I don't get a pay check until next week.  2. Talk to their supervisor.  Or 3. Talk about how you are a loyal customer and you feel like this is wrong.    3.  get a credit card linked to your checking out so in case you do go into overdraft...the credit card will automatically put money in your checking account.
