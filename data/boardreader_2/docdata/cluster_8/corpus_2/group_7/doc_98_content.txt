 so don't cry too much for their lost income.  We also carry cards for convenience.  They are paid in full every month.  I got the same sort of letter from Citibank, and while it pisses me off, I'm just not using it as much, and will continue to pay every month in full.  Stupid and short-sighted attempt by them to catch people being hurt by this downturn and make a few more bucks.
