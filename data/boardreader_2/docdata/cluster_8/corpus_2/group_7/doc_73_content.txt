DS got a couple of OD charges on his Bank of America and they were $35 per check! You can bet he won't do it again. He was using his debit card and checking his balance instead of keeping track of it. He had one debit card charge that took almost three weeks to come out and he forgot about it and assumed the balance shown was correct. The two $35 fees he was charged were for lunches at about $5 each.
