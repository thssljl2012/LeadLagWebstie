The only issue i don't like is being looked into...    It used to be 18% was the top..  more than that is soprano's.  Then they allowed say Citibank to raise because Lowes was late...    They need to FIX the interest rates to a level that is "PAYABLE".  but people need to pay their own amounts...   i only have 1 for emergencies after going to Korea and coming back in 92 with 5 credit cards and 18k in debt due to the new wife having general power of attorny while i was gone..    took me 12years to fix that.
