In 1994, Obama was one of a team of attorneys involved in a lawsuit filed against Citibank (Buycks-Roberson v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank) for "redlining" which forced lenders to lend in areas where borrowers had a history of foreclosures. Obama was directly responsible for banks lowering their credit standards and making sub-prime loans. ACORN filed, or threatened to file, hundreds of these lawsuits and then opened up a mortgage counseling division to help people with poor credit get loans.     A slight correction to your last sentence. It should read "...help people with no credit extort banks money".
