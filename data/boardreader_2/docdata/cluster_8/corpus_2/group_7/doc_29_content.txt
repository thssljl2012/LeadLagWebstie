      Hey,      So for the last year or so, I've had a "bank of america platinum plus" visa credit card.  Until now, its been useful for my purposes - namely, boosting my credit score, since I pay my balance off in full each month.  Whenever I use this card, I get "points", which are, to the best of my knowledge, pretty useless.  Supposedly I can exchange them for cash, but by my calculations, I'm getting &lt; 1%.  I want to improve this.      For background information, I have a checking account with BoA, and I like being able to transfer funds from my checking to credit card electronically.  I spent an average of ~400-500 monthly, mostly on food and groceries, with some odds and ends thrown in.  Based on this, would there be any sort of credit card you folks could recommend?   Thanks!
