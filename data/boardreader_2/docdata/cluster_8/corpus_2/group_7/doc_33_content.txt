I left Bank of America years ago for the exact same reason.  It was apparent they were applying my debits and credits in some nonsensical way so as to hit me with overdraft fees, they wouldn't do anything for me, so I dropped them.  I'm with Wells Fargo now, but have overdraft protection on my account.  They've been ok, but my experience hasn't been without an issue or two.  They lost my Stafford student loans to a competitor because their loan consolidation website was so shitty, I couldn't finish the application, kept on timing out on me, and it didn't save your progress, so I had to start over every time.  After trying about 5 times I said "screw this" and now that approx. $15k loan (original balance) is with Sallie Mae.  I'm not going to jump through hoops to pay you money in the form of interest.
