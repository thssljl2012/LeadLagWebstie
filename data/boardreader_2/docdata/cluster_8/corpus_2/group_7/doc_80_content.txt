Because of the drop in interest rates, if the bank now relend that money it would be at a 4% lower rate (due to drop in interest over the last 12 months)... so... WE have to pay the difference                            It's not specific to Australia. That's always the situation of a fixed rate loan. As the name suggests it's a Fixed rate over a Fixed period. If you break the terms of the agreement then it's standard practise that you will pay compensation. The fees that you'll pay are exacerbated by the dramatic change in interest rates, but you'll find it's the same situation back in the UK.
