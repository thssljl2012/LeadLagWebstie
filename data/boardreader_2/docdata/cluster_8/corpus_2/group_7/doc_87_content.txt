     Why must pay bill so close to the due date? I just set all mine to automatically pay by GIRO. So much simpler and I get peace of mind.     Also, why do people nowadays think that late fee + interest can be automatically waived and its your right to waive it? The bank already put there in black and white for you to see, if you pay late it should be your own problem.
