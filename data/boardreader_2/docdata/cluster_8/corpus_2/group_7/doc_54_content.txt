         This was probably predictable, but now that the party is over, and the banks are getting squeezed, they've decided to start pushing down.    http://www.latimes.com/business/printedition/la-fi-lazarus15...    Millions of cardholders have recently received letters from the likes of Citibank, Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and American Express Co. notifying them that their interest rates are going up, in some cases to 30% if a single payment is missed.    Now, most Fools know that keeping a high balance on your credit cards is a bad idea, but it seems to me that this is not the time to start squeezing people. The article mentions a fellow carrying 45k worth of debt on 8 different cards. People like that are living on the edge, and raising the interest rate on their accounts is clearly NOT going to be in anyone's best interest. It squeezes them, makes them unable to pay their bill, forcing them into bankruptcy, and that will insure that the bank will actually get LESS than they would if they didn't raise rates.   So - is this a fear tactic just to get the Feds to lay off, or are the banks so incredibly stupid as to think this is going to help them somehow?   Can this lead to anything except a wave of bankruptcy and foreclosures that otherwise might not occur?  If so, I can't see what it might be...  Batten down the hatches kids, the next wave is coming.
