     I had one bad (or funny) experience with a DBS promoter. I made an application with her. After two months, nothing was heard. So I just picked up another application at ATM and submit it at the lady branch office. And the card was approved. After that, the promoter called me and told me that they need some more documents. I told her that I already received the card, and she asked me why I made another application.     I just told her I haven't heard from her for a long time, but she didn't seem to happy about it      I think it's sometimes better to deal at the branch office rather than with a promoter.
