Yup, yesterday, I call BOA and asked if I could possibly get my interest rate reduce, I pay on time, mostly more than I have to. I was transfered to another person, who asked me many questions about my finances. After he was finished with his questions, he told be that I had to aggressivly pay over the basic monthly charge for 6 months, and then told me that he had recuced my credit limitl. Nice hah? All I wanted to do was try to get my rate reduced, and instead he reduced my credit limit. I told him that I could make much higher payments if the rate was not so rediculous. Basically talking to a stone wall. Wish that I never called. Just got a bigger shafting.
