I guess the moral to this story is credit worthy people like me are paying for all the dead beats mistakes, by the way my FICO is 785.                        no way. chase is the best credit card company ever. I have been late multiple times on promotional interest rate cards...2 days late. i call them and say im sorry, i had a problem and just didnt realize it.  they always say, ok sir, we will reinstate the promo rate of 4% - as opposed to 29%      bank of america....freakin bastards. i wish death on them.  i was 1 day late on a 0% and begged them. some indian dude i couldnt not understand said, sorry we can help you...the monthly pmt doubled.      so i took a promotional balance transfer check and attempted to transfer the balance...then i get a letter saying sorry we can not accept your check because even though it appears that the company issuing the check (AAA) is different, we are actually one in the same company.      so i called chase, and they set me up nice.       DOWN WITH BANK OF AMERICA AND WHATEVER OTHER NAZI COMPANY THEY OWN      BURN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
