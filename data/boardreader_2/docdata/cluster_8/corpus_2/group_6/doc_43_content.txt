   Judged:     1       check the little finger it surely is not there. he has no class. he is good at fantasy and myths, is he not one of both. The neocons got just what they wanted, and the people got what they wanted. I think the voters of bush got their bubble busted. Look what they got in return== lost 401Ks., two unfinished wars,costing close to a trillion dollars. foreclosed on thwir homes, a WALL STREET melt down,another fiasico. The failureof a bank bail out, another failure. A depression,oops he calls it a recession. now we have Bearnie Madoff, a 50 million dollar scam artist that the sec cleared after 4 times checking his books. folks even the bailout money is paying off the insurance that is owed to people by A.I.G insurance. Now Bank of America is back after they got their first stimulus check of billions of dollars from the bailout, wanting another stimulus bail check of another 10 billion dollars. Reckon you or I can get a billion do;llar stimulus check. nope, just a lousy unemployment check if you are luck What did BUSH leave you anyway.
