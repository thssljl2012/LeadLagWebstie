I heard that they asked for the 2nd round of money because the takeover of Merrill Lynch was more costly than they thought. To me that doesn't sound like they could handle it. So we, the taxpayers, are supposed to bail out B of A FURTHER, which will result in thousands of jobs lost - meaning that the taxpayers are contributing to our own job losses?      Greed, greed, greed. The only thing important to the shareholders and the execs are themselves and their exhorbitant salaries and bonuses/dividends. Why is it that it's okay for a company to merge, resulting in job losses, and then pawn those who lost their jobs off to the already struggling Unemployment programs? I think that NO merger or takeover should be approved unless it's able to be done without public money and without any job losses. Companies should be required to be responsible for their employees, not pawn them off on the state.     It won't make a difference to B of A, but today I am starting the process of closing my B of A checking account and my B of A Visa card in PROTEST of what they're doing. Then I won't have anything with B of A - they obviously don't need my money or me as a customer - they'll have the bailout money and their execs. I'll take my money elsewhere.
