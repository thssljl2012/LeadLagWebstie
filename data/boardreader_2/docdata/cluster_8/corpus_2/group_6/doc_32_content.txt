If the feedback is good and the money has been transferred I wouldn't worry too much about it.                      Thanks LulaMae! The payment was made overnight, so I'm not going to worry about it any longer. Perhaps he or she bought it as a gift...you are right....and a very nice gift indeed! I think that I'm a 'nervous nellie' because of prior bad experiences. That...and the fact that we had to cancel our main Bank of America credit card three times this past year because somehow, thieves managed to get the number and place fraudulent charges on it. How in the world do these people manage to do this????   I must say that we use that particular card a lot and we use it everywhere. I have my own personal cards, but (knock on wood) they've been spared....it's just been the one BOA card!      Oh well....I'm sure this will turn out fine, and I'm happy to have sold my Prada as that's one less thing that has to go back to  Saks  tomorrow! LOL!
