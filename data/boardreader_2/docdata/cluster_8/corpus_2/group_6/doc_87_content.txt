Holy dog poop!  $368/yr in overdraft charges?  No wonder the country is in trouble, nobody can manage their money.  I've had $60 in charges my whole life and it was because the bank changed their terms and neglected to tell me.     FWIW, it is normal bank procedure to run checks of higher amounts before checks of lower amount.  Their logic is that the larger check is obviously more important, so it should go first.  Unfortunately that usually ends up costing you 3 or 4 times as much in fees if you have other checks outstanding at the time.
