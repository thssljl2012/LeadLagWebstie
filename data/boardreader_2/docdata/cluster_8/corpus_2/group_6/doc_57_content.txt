          What do you think. Are the UK banks still worth averaging down into? Will you continue with the times purchases of shares in UK Banks and Bank of America?   Very much so yes Duc. Am quite happy to continue with my strategy and as ever we'll find out if it worked in a number of years time.   Im not so sure BertEEE, I can envisage a scenario where we get a traditional bank run on RBS/BARC or LLOY for example since its not part of the Government's bailout and which may we (if its CDS is anything to go by) be in the same boat as RBS.    Cost of credit protection for for senior debt at the UKs three main banks - the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and Barclays were all 3bp-5bp wider. CDS for RBSs senior debt was at 95bp-105bp on Monday morning, while peers Lloyds and Barclays were at 92bp-102bp and 170bp-180bp, respectively.   This is already a problem recognised by businesses who are simply taking all the credit being extended to them.   As a saver you arent getting anything on your current account anyways. So why sit around and run the risk of the bank going under and you having to do all the paperwork to get some/all your money back?  Right now people are buying into the governments misdirection - that it was all about RBS irresponsible lending. The markets dont seem to be buying it any longer. So it may well just be a question of time before depositors decide to take their money out of the UK Banks.
