I got burned once a few years back (I ONLY did online banking, didn't keep a balance).  Then I kept a written balance as well and they screwed me even when I kept above the limit.  It was even listed correctly on my online statement, but they insisted that it (and I) was wrong about the whole ordeal and that I needed to do a better job of balancing my check book (it's 3rd grade math  ).    I was right, they were wrong. I checked it enough times to be sure.  It's a good thing those jackasses on the other end of the phone weren't next to me, I'd probably make their ears bleed I was screaming so loud.                      had the same thing happen to me at first federal, i had an account since i was a paper boy in the 6th grade all the way till i was 20, dropped them, then standard federal did the same thing.  I even talked to a manager there that said "banks don't make mistakes".  That was her exact words.  At that particular bank, no less than three times, they put my money in my dads, account, just cause we have the same last name, i go by a first name nick name that is similar but different, and different middle name, and of course OUR ACCOUNTS WERE NOT MUTUAL/joint ACCOUT, and every number was different on the account.  How is putting money in the wrong account on a regular basis not a "mistake"    Banks just suck.  I love my credit union.
