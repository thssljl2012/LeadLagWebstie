Hi all!  Please please forgive me if this is posted elsewhere.  I am leaving the US for Hong Kong (and then to Bangkok,Singapore,Bali) in 35 days for a long nomadic journey    and I am curious about the best/financially smartest ATM card to have. Currently, I have a Visa debit card from Bank of America (has Interlink and Plus Star logos on back) and a MasterCard from Citibank (has Cirrus logo on back).   I've read with the Visa debit from BofA, they charge a $5 fee every time you withdraw from an ATM.  And to only have a few days worth of cash on you at any given time, so technically I could be looking at $50 in fees a month for withdrawing money???  How does everyone else handle this? Don't know if/when I'd ever use the MasterCard ??  I'll be gone for an undetermined amount of time so I of course want to be as efficient as possible with misc fees.    many thanks!
