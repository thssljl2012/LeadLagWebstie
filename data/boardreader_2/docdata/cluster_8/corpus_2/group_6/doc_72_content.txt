Hi      I am so confused.  I am hoping someone can shed some light on this for me.  I have a house in Florida and I have missed two payments.  I am unemployed - this is the hardship.  Prior to this I have never been late or missed a payment - anywhere.  My credit score was 799 - 806.      I called my bank in November and they said they&#039;d work with me.  They promised a forbearance and then a loan modification, saying that I will not incur any late fees and that my payment would be lowered and my interest fixed.  I sent them the docs they required.  Since then, I have called every 2 weeks to follow up and everyone assured me it would be taken care of.        Last time I called, the rep said that they can&#039;t help me, that they don&#039;t do loan mods, that they won&#039;t touch my interest and that they don&#039;t reduce principles.  So I said - "are you telling me all the last 8 people I talked to were lying to me?"  She said:  "No ma&#039;am, that was incorrect information."       I am so frustrated... don&#039;t know who to believe any more.  The bank is Countrywide/Bank of America - used to be the biggest lender in the US (Cntrywide).        As far as foreclosure in Florida I am told it&#039;s insane, more like a short sale, in that, even if I walk away from the house - which is in great condition with nice upgrades such as granite tops, porcelain floors etc, still, they would make me pay the difference.      What are my options?  Any advice you have would be helpful.  Ideally I&#039;d like to keep it and rent it - since I can&#039;t afford to pay it... I can always rent a room for a lot less while the market levels out a bit.      Thank you
