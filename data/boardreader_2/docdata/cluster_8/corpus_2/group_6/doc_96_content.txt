Well with your incident, it may be tough to get a prime credit card, but not impossible considering I don&#039;t know what your credit report looks like. You may want to look at subprime credit cards.      Don&#039;t keep applying for credit cards. You shouldn&#039;t apply anymore than twice in a short amount of time.      Bank of America sets high credit criteria so it may be tough.
