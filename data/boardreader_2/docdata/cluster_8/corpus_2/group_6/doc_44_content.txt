           Advertisements [ ? ]                         I had a very candid talk with my credit card company today; I ask them if I can get an interest rate deduction since I (as a tax payer) helped to rescue their sorry ass today as part owner of that $20 billion we just gave them.  I wish I had not a penny with Bank of America (BOA), but as a working divorced dad to two teenagers coupled with a mediocre pay scale in education, I have built up a debt that is about what the average American carries. I have just 2 credit cards and I have an excellent credit rating. I've never had the misfortune of having to declare bankruptcy or default on a loan. My little house in the country is on the 30 year mortgage plan.  The  person on the other end of the credit card co. line said he has been getting questions like mine all day.  I asked him  would I as a good customer see any benefit to BOA's huge 20 billion fucking dollar bailout?   He said that  most of the money is going to adjust down people's interest rates that have been unable to make payments or have had to default on their account.   He also said that  another big pile of that money is going to shore up the lost revenue from bad home loans.   I said,  OK - I'm all for helping the down and out, but what about us regular working folk that have made our payments on time and lived within our means...the bank that fucked up gets rescued, the folks that either fucked up and/or ran into hard times gets rescued --- but what about your responsible hard working lower to middle class folk?  What about me?   He said,  well - you deserve a piece of the pie, but your last on the list to get help. You did not fuck up.    What the moral of this story?                                ...
