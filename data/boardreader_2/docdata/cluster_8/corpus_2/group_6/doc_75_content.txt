           My brother has a checking account with an automatic withdrawal from a company named Fla Card Services, NA. In 2007, the amount was $93.00 per paycheck.  In 2008, the amount changed to $185.00. It's a big hit when his take-home is $596.00.  How can I track down this company?  The automatic withdrawals are to pay off a $10,000.00 credit card debt after the company closed his account.  I'm on the account and will visit his bank Monday because I do not understand what is happening.  Has anyone on this board dealt with the same problem? What did you do?   What do you mean by "per paycheck"?  Are they deducting the amount from his pay, or taking it out of his bank account?  Are you sure it's not FIA? (i, not L)?  FIA Card Services is somehow the successor company of MBNA and Bank of America card services.    Regarding the amount increasing, it sounds like he signed up for automatic payments for his credit card, paying only the minimum due.  In the past few years, credit card companies have been increasing the minimum due.  On a $10,000 balance, $186 a month (93 x 2 pay periods a month) would just barely cover the monthly interest if its around 10%.  FIA's phone number is 800-655-1491.  It looks like they are also known as IBSnet services.
