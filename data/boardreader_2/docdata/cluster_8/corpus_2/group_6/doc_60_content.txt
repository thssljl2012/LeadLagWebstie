 I now have come to believe that the large banks should be allowed to go under and eat their losses. My last Bank of America Visa Statement shows a 51.62 percent annual rate when such things as Balance Transfers, Cash Advances and Purchases are included on an account that is not paid up. I pay up in full each month so I'm not suffering like many people are. With rates like 51.62 percent I would hope that Congress would Nationalize our large banks and not continue to bail them out, as seems the case with the Bank of America. I would also hope that laws would be put into placepreventing runaway interest on the many store front "PayDay" type loan sharks that have sprung up all around us in the past few years.
