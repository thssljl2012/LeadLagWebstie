But they will accept a Matricula Consular card, so when you say "no ID" you're correct in saying they don't need a U.S. government issued ID. Oh, and since virtually nobody at the bank knows what a Matricula Consular card is supposed to look like, they don't even need to have a real one. There's a new black market industry dealing in fake Matricula cards now. It's always another scam, always another way to circumvent the law. And we just sit there and take it, because we don't want to "anger our neighbors."     You are correct.. here in Chicago we had an alderman's father selling ID's to illegal aliens for the last 5 years(they know of).. these illegals have bought homes, cars and even voted.. he didn't pay taxes and they figure he made $180,000 a year he got 4 years.. if he were a citizen he'd be locked up so far back he'd never see the sun... I have a problem I don't care who I anger.. most people I know feel the same way.. but it doesn't matter how many of us there are the U.S. Commerce WANTS THE ILLEGALS therefore they pay our representatives more and will get their way unless we go to Washington with pitch forks
