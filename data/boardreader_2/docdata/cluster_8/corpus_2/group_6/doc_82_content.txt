Here&#039;s the story i mess my my credit card account with HSBC, and it looks like they shut down my credit card.. i know i was stupid to over spend over the $1,5000 limit they gave me. even though i let giving me card to my mother when she ask for it. and she did promise to pay me back  when she gets her income tax.. but now i&#039;m thinking my mother is not going to keep her word. which is fine i will let it go      i&#039;ll still pay HSBC back there money, and i will promise never to let my mother use my credit card again. i really do not want to spend her to jail, since she spend that money when i told her not too. so like i was saying i can&#039;t send her to jail because she has grand children, and i do not want to take there  grand mother from them      So i am thinking of opening  account from Bank of America, and will try to get a new Credit card from them. that is if i will be able to do this, since i only get pay $480. though Social security each month, i really want  a new credit card to improve my credit, and will be a good credit card to have      I Have a Debt card from HBSC but  the date say&#039;s it&#039;s valid in 2010      So can i sign up with Bank of America or would that be a bad idea thanks
