Its a great scam. The government has already made provisions to change this so credit card companies cant raise rates for non-default costomers. This does not take effect until July 2010.      I transferred my balance to another card and a few months later they lowered my rate back down.      ALso HSBC is not the only one doing this. Bank of America does it daily as well as Citi for customers who have never been late.                      How does that affect folks that pay off in full every month though?  Is there a finance charge applied to the 'grace period?'  (I'm away from my statements right now, I'll have to check them when I get home)      i.e. I pay my full bill every month, how does it affect me?
