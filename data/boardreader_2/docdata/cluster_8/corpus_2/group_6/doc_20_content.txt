I feel your pain. I went in to local BOA to add my wife to my account when we got married.  A week later went back to deposit a check and the teller informs me I do not have an account with Bank of america. I tell her I've had the same account for 7 years.  Well, she looks up my social and says it is melissa's, my wifes account. So in the end my wife had to go fill out the same paperwork I had to a week before to add her to the account, just so I could be put back on my own account. To this day I am still not the primary own my account.
