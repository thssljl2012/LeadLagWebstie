  YOU Mofers arent getting my money!        Sombishes got into my bank account.       From someone else...           Quote:                         My Bank of America debit card was charged for $34.62 from this company who I did not authorize to make any payments to. This company is associated or is the same as  FindSupportOnline.com  which charged my card on the same day for $34.62 and  othermembers.com  which charged $39.97. The  othermembers.com  also charged .03 cents and $1.00 earlier this month. Find these thieves, seize their assets and jail them! Call your credit/debit card and report this fraud, also call your police department and file a report for having your credit/debit card used illegally and information stolen.
