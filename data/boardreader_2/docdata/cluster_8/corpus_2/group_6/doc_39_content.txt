 Over the past couple of months I missed a couple of payments on my Bank of America card. I was out of town for some of the time and just forgot to make a payment. They put my interest rate at 10 times what it had been before. I pointed out that I had sent them 600.00 all of my fees and penalties but informed them that i would not be able to pay the higher interest rate which is now 30%. They refused and closed my credit card hurting my credit but keeping the new 30% interest fee intact. Bank of America has little mercy or patience for their customers and they are burying people like me and at the same time getting massive government welfare. Obviously Bank of America is a dark enterprise whose ambition for money and power has created a significant negative influence on the lives hundreds of thousands of people. I do not know what can be done about them But I do wish that something is done change this company into something much worthy of its name.    http://SunflowerPipes.com
