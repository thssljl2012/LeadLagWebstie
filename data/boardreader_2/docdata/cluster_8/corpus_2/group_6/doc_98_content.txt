I didn't make the payment early, that was done by automatic withdrawal.  I wrote it in my check ledger twice in one month, but only made the payment once.  That meant my ledger showed that I had $597 less than I really had, which was fine.  Then my wife fixed it without mentioning it, which meant the amount was correct.  The next month I didn't write the $597 in my ledger because I thought it was still in there from before.  As a result, I thought there was $597 in my account that wasn't there and I spent that nonexistent money on what were probably some trivial things and overdrafted it.     FWIW, I did pay the truck off almost a year early as well as my boat.  There was not a prepayment penalty on either of them and I wouldn't take a loan that had a prepayment penalty.  That's just silly.  The sooner I pay it back the sooner they can give it to someone else at higher interest.
