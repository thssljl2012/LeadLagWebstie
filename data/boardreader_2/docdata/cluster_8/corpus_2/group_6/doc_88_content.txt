When I opened my account with them I had it setup to put $200/month in a savings account and that money was supposed to be automatically transferred in the event that I overdrafted.  One month I wrote my truck payment (auto tranfer from checking) in my checkbook twice.  My wife caught the mistake and fixed it, but didn't tell me.  The next month I didn't write it in because I was one payment ahead in my ledger.  Wrong.  I paid the truck payment and several bills and it overdrafted 3 times.  If they had run the truck payment last it would have only done it once.  When I got the notice I called and asked WTF was going on and they told me it was overdrafted.  No kidding, I could tell that from the letter.  When I told her they additional money was supposed to come from savings she told me the didn't do that and never had.  To bad I still had the documentation from when I opened the account that showed that they should have pulled the money from savings.  They still wouldn't refund the charges though.   Pissed me off.                        hmm i imagine that is like a bank, they have loan costs. Most places, home loans included, they expect and need you to make X amount of payments.  Early payments might get you penalized.  Though i have never been so flush with cash and no where to put it or invest it at higher rate than my interest, that i said ohhh ill just pay off my loan 3 years early.  I think thats what they did, probably in the loan ... cant say for sure, as i said, i was never in such a hurry as to make extra payments early (i realize your was an accident)
