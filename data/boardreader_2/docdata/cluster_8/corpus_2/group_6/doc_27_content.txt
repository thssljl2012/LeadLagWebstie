        You can re-deposit a returned check one time only, meaning the person who wrote the check can get dinged for the same check 2 times only.      OP, what do you intend to do to make sure this doesn't happen to you again? I have my checking account at Bank of America and do not have a savings account there. Therefore, I have linked my Visa for overdrafts, just in case.       To avoid this costly bummer in the future...   1. Keep track of your balance.   2. Have some sort of overdraft protection set up, just in case.      I agree you have not told the whole story (your perogative, of course). If it was one overdraft one time, it would not be a $700 fee. There must have been multiple items hitting your overdrawn account.
