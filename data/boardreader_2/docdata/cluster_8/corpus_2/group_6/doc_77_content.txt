My last 100 interactions with BoA employees has been horrible at best.                      Yep mine Christian financial, not sure if they have west side/down river branches.  but unless you need to go to the window or see a loan officer, you just could telebank.      They have visa mastercards,    they do car loans, i have never bought a vehicle with anyone other than them.    They do do home loans, small business loans etc.  They have all there financials on the wall in the branch. Off the top of my head a few of the colums were $50-60 million bucks this year, so i think its still small, its not 500 billion like citi bank, but its more than 100 folks pooling there money together, which i get the impression thats what some folks think a credit union is like.    Its still FDIC guranteed savings accounts, most every feature a public traded bank like Citibank, BOA etc has.    The people there are nicer, they call you if you have a problem,  never has a problem, per se, but i have questions, i call leave a message, and a manager calls me back with the answer.  No waiting in a waiting room.    No lines, the usually have 2-3 girls working the counter  (2 counter, 1 on drive though, or 1 and 1)  even if you go on friday (pay day) at 5-6 pm the drive though line is but 2-3 cars, and inside they have you in and out in 5-7 minutes.    I couldnt handle going back to a big mega bank.       Christian Financial Credit Union     if by any chance you are a sprint phone guy, i just got 10% off my contract, and i think i got it off my accessories andf my new phone.  Thats the life of the contract, just showing them my christian financial credit card.  Not sure if the other cell providers do that.  But look into that, that can be 80-120 bucks right there in the bill, and $30 off a phone.
