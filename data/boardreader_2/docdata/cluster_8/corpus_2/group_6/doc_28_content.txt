  IN.HOUSTON  Thank you for the advice. I am a little nervous about attaching my current home to an investment property. I have another option that I would like opinions on. I have a credit card with Bank of America. The credit line is $80,000 and I have a cash advance offer that would be 3.99% apr for the life of the "balance transfer" which includes depositing the check into my checking account. The balance transfer fee is a maximum of $75 so that is not a problem. I am not familiar with LLC or S CORP's of business loans but I think the concept of both is to have the minimum amount of personal liability. How does the credit card idea compare to the options you suggested? Also, you mentioned bidding 50% of the asking price on multiple properties and it seems that you have had much success, but I should have been more specific about this property.  1. About 1 year ago we submitted an offer for a similar property(1200sq ft. 3bd\2bath) on the SAME STREET for $115,000 and we were outbid. Our current house is a bit large for us (1500sq ft, 2 people with no plans for children). The idea then was to buy the smaller house and rent out our larger house. If we bought the new house at $75,000 it would be about 65% of what we feel the property is worth(the original $115k that we bid a year ago). In addition to the purchase price, we would need the $10-15k in improvements.   I am not sure if I am clarifying our circumstances or making it more confusing but I hope I have given a bit more info about our situation.  Thanks again.
