FWIW, it is normal bank procedure to run checks of higher amounts before checks of lower amount.  Their logic is that the larger check is obviously more important, so it should go first.  Unfortunately that usually ends up costing you 3 or 4 times as much in fees if you have other checks outstanding at the time.                      This isn't just about BoA doing one check before the other...it's a matter of them charging you the OD fee EVEN when you never dipped below $0.  I got burned once a few years back (I ONLY did online banking, didn't keep a balance).  Then I kept a written balance as well and they screwed me even when I kept above the limit.  It was even listed correctly on my online statement, but they insisted that it (and I) was wrong about the whole ordeal and that I needed to do a better job of balancing my check book (it's 3rd grade math  ).    I was right, they were wrong. I checked it enough times to be sure.  It's a good thing those jackasses on the other end of the phone weren't next to me, I'd probably make their ears bleed I was screaming so loud.
