  Abbie     The best thing to do is pay your bills though your bank bill pay. It you use a bank first you have a record of all the payment you have paid at least you do with USBANK for the last 6 months and the date they paid them.    Also with a bank bill pay You can put your bills in ahead and just asign a date to them when the bank is to pay them. With us being on a monthly check that is what I do. When our check comes in I go down my list with the due dates and just put it all in bill pay in one day. End of bills for the month. The bank makes the list I print it out for my records and if anyone says they didn't get the money I got a record of when the bank paid them and the confirmation number.    Saves tons on charges.     Bank of America changed my son's due date from the 22nd to the 17th He didn't notice it His payment got to them on the 18th. He was paying 6.9 and they jumped him to 29% on a 14,000.00 bill. Raised his percentage of payment from 2% to 4%. Now that hurts.    But he learned a good lesson. Now he is trying to transfer the balance out to a new card.
