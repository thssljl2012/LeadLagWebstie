I need to rant about Bank of America quickly. If you'll remember, last year we did that 0% balance transfer thing. Well, on the day we did the transfer the guy had me do a phone payment to get it to a zero balance and then did the transfer. The fee is normally $15 for a phone payment, but he credited it back. Well, I guess the credit went through a little late and now EVERY SINGLE month I get charged a $1.50 finance fee. And EVERY SINGLE month I call them and they assure me it won't show up next month. Well, this month it showed up AGAIN.   I am going to call today and just demand a supervisor and then his supervisor. I am so ticked off. I know it is only $1.50, but that adds up over a year and I'm not giving the stupid credit card company a penny more than they deserve.  The way to get rid of it should be to transfer the entire balance to a new balance....and maybe for my hassle they'll extend my 0% term (that would be nice)! I'm just so aggravated because THEY screw up and I have to spend my time and effort trying to get it fixed.
