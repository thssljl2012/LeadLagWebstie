~~Take a picture I.D. to any bank you want (best to choose something close to you), and ask to open a new account. I personally use Bank of America and love them. Every bank will go over the different checking accounts they offer so you can best choose the one that fits your needs. You can also look online at various banks to see what they offer.      As for your old account, you can withdraw the money any way you normally do. If you want to close it, just tell the bank you have it with you want to close it, and they will do this for you. It should not matter if your parents are signers on it, as long as you are one too. If it&#039;s under your parents name, then tell them they have to close it, so you won&#039;t incur maintenance charges on it any longer.      What ever bank you choose, just make sure they are FDIC insured and you are always safe.~~
