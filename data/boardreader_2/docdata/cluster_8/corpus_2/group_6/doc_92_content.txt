I have PNC as my bank, but before I had a account there, i went there every friday to cash my paycheck cuz my job used PNC. They always cashed it for me without a problem and were very nice. eventually I got a account with them becuz I liked them so much. They never charged me no 5 dollars and I kno you live in jersey so it aint like we are going to two totally different PNCs or somethin, im sure they are all the same in NJ. I go there to cash my unemployment check every 2 weeks too and I have 9 cents in my account and my checks for 220 and they cash it, they dont tell me that i have to have the money in my account for them to cash it or nothing like that, and it aint written on PNC. So either they totally totally changed their policies in the one or two years since I was cashing my checks there without a account with them, or you are confusing them with a different bank or just got a shitty branch that lied to you. I kno that chase charges 5 bucks but I aint never heard of that at PNC. PNC is the only bank ive ever went to that was halfway decent plus i like em cuz they are all over jersey, they aint hard to find like some banks are. And they got a lot of em in Paterson which is perfect for me        The shit you are sayin about BoA is the direct opposite of my experience with them. I will share my other check cashing experiences with yall.      First: My aunt writes me a check for 25 dollars for giving her a manicure which i do every 2 wks. She has a account at BoA. She writes the check to "cash". which is totally acceptable. I sign it, and go to BoA to cash it. They say they cant cash it, becuz it aint written to ME. "CASH" means that its to anyone and anyone can cash it. So watever, i tell my aunt to write it to me.      She writes it out to my first initial and my name. Lacey Montega (my alias since I aint puttin my government on here for sure!)       So it says L. Montega on there and I sign it and they wont cash it again. They say it has to be out to my name not my initial.      Okay...So, she then writes the check out to Lace Montega (ya kno, like a guy named matthew williams might have a check to Matt Williams , it aint like its some totally different name) and they say they STILL cant cash it becuz it aint my FULL name! WTF!      So then I get one out to my FULL name, and have my ID, and my second form of ID since i aint got a account with them...and they say they cant cash it unless I have a account with them, even tho the check is written on their bank! Yo, i am tellin you they just do EVERYTHING they can to fucking make this shit difficult. I dont kno if its becuz youre older purepremium and im a 21 yr old kid who looks hood and makes a appearance that people think they cant trust me or something or some bullshit like that. But real talk, BoA definately does NOT cash checks if you have no account with them and just freely cash watever you want.       They dont even cash checks made out on their own bank written by a person who has a account at THAT PARTICULAR BRANCH ( i even went to the one in the town that my aunt lives at, so its the SAME branch that she would go to, to cash her check and they know her name there and they still gave me shit. ) Its clear that they are SUPPOSED to cash them, but the reality is that they DONT follow their own policies. Ive even pointed out the sign to the teller that says "non customers mst have 2 forms of ID to cash a check" and they say well you have to have a account. Like they must know they are lying and they just do it anyways for some shitty reason. And its only fucking 25 dollars not like some crazy sum of money.  Its jus un fuckin believable to me the way they make it so hard for you to get the most simplest ass thing done there and treat you like shit while they do it.      The Is, that story is fucked lol. I am glad someone else hates them as much as i do. Thats totally fuckin ridiculous that they laughed at you and the worst part is i can SEE that happening cuz that is wat they did when me and my man was trying to cash his check. The manager was sooo rude and condescending and pretty much laughed in our faces and then got ANGRY when he was told that he had to cash it! lol man they are trippin at BoA they really are.                      Nope.. it is definitly PNC... Actually the brand new one in South Paterson.... I wrote a business check out in my name to go and cash... and the woman said can I please have your account number.. I said I don't have an account here, I just opened up this business account and I want to cash this check... she says ooohhhh we can't cash this check if you don't have an account here... Then I made her call the manager over and said we just opened this account and I will take it and leave if you aren't going to accomodate my needs.  Then she said okay just this one time, and then said BUT I have to charge you $5.00 to cash this check with us since you don't have an account here.  And for future notice we will not cash any checks without having an account here.  It was absoultly ridiculous.  If they weren't giving me such a good rate with the credit card machines I would have been gone the second she told me $5.00 to cash the check.  But that's just my experience
