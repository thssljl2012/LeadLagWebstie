You can stop check anywhere in line but a card cannot be stopped. To make matters worse one charge was a health spa in Italy. Takes two weeks to process oversea transaction. BOA says you money will be replaced next day. NOT. Money was not replaced till overseas cleared which was two weeks the account was on hold                      The money was still on hold, hadn't cleared, in my account and Wachovia just deleted the hold 2 hours after I originally called them.  Gotta give it to them this time...they've been doin better as of late.
