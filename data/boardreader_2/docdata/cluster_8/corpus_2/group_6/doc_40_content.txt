The problem isn't about the amount is below or under 10k -under, anyways-, but:      - It has to come from an American bank. Do you know of any American retail bank operating in Austria? Or I can cross the German border for a day trip, if it is the solution.      - It has to come from my name, so a friend wiring the funds from his account is not the answer.      - It has to be either a wire transfer or a cashier's cheque in the bank's name, but in the second case, I write my name on the note field. As I have found, Euro banks don't let me do a wire transfer, unless I actually hold an account with the given institution. Is it an option if I open an account -if an American bank exists here and this is the only solution- only for one day: I do the transaction, then close the account. I am sure the clerks will like me                        This is still a bit confusing. I don't understand why it has to come from an American bank.  A cashiers check is treated the same as cash. A cashiers check leaves a paper trail and has the ability to be tracked, where cash doesn't. You can buy a cashiers check at any bank with cash. They will verify that the bills are not counterfeit and cut you a cashiers check.      In Germany, Deutsche Bank is the "partner bank" with Bank of America. It is not the same bank but they have an agreement between the two. This might work for you. I doubt you will be able to open an account, send a wire transfer, and close the account all in one day. The wire transfer is not an immediate occurrence and the account will be required to stay open for several days until everything clears.      In the past, I have also bought travelers checks and mailed them as payments. Again they are considered the same as cash. Is that an option?
