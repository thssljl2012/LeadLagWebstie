I even talked to a manager there that said "banks don't make mistakes".  That was her exact words.  At that particular bank, no less than three times, they put my money in my dads, account, just cause we have the same last name, i go by a first name nick name that is similar but different, and different middle name, and of course OUR ACCOUNTS WERE NOT MUTUAL/joint ACCOUT, and every number was different on the account.  How is putting money in the wrong account on a regular basis not a "mistake"    Banks just suck.  I love my credit union.                      I've been thinking about a credit union...is it pretty much just a bank that doesn't do loans or anything?    I mean, I don't need to earn interest on anything, just need a debit card and a place to have my paycheck direct deposited.  My last 100 interactions with BoA employees has been horrible at best.
