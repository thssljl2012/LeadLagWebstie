          What do you think. Are the UK banks still worth averaging down into? Will you continue with the times purchases of shares in UK Banks and Bank of America?   Berteee  Very much so yes Duc. Am quite happy to continue with my strategy and as ever we'll find out if it worked in a number of years time.    Is there a single post that sets out the strategy you are referring to.   What date you started, and what particular banks you were focusing on?   cheers p.
