   I have a CHASE card (formerly Capital One) I have had this card for 10 years. I did a balance transfer 4 years ago with a 3.99% balance transfer rate for life of loan. I have had this on auto pay since then. Never late - did everything according to agreement. Minimum payment entire 4 years has been 2% of balance. Received a change in terms in Nov'08 that I would have to increase my payment to 5% of minimum. Payment went from 283.00 per month to 705.00 per month and for this I only pay an additional 10.00 fee per month! My other option was to have the balance (14,609.00) increased to 7.99% for the life of loan and still pay only the 2% minimum. Oh yeah, the third option- pay it off in full and close the account.     PLEASE WRITE YOUR ELECTED OFFICIALS AND LET THEM KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.     DON'T TRUST CHASE BANK - just this week they sent me an offer to do another balance transfer for life of loan!        Changing the rules once you get the business - I'D BE EMBARASSED TO WORK FOR CHASE.    MY TRUST IS GONE - NEVER TO RETURN.
