Easy fix; don't use a card or write a check if there isn't enough money in the checking account to cover it. Transfer the funds from saving to checking BEFORE using the card.                         I totally agree with your statement 100% (I did not use debit) and would have put the funds in if I knew how much the doctor's visit was going to be.  But in the past I have been able to use my bankcard as credit and deposit funds that same day and as long as the deposit cleared before the transaction cleared everything was lovely.  I understand the process, it just wasn't consistent with how things have worked the past 5 years.
