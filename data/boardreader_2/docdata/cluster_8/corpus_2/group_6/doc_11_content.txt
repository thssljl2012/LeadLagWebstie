It would always take two phone calls to make sure the charges didn't keep appearing on my statements, and the automatic payment I set up for that account wouldn't withdraw the money from my checking account if it was on a Saturday or Sunday, so they would withdraw the money BEFORE my paycheck was actually deposited and ended up overdrafting my account several times before another rep finally changed the withdrawal date for me. When I asked why they don't take the money out on the date I specified since that was an option when I did the balance transfer (choosing the date of payment withdrawal), I never got an answer from them and the rep said it was my fault for not noticing one of the dates happened to fall on a weekend. Oh sorry, let me look 6 MONTHS in advance on my calendar to make sure it doesn't fall on a weekend ...                      This is why I don't do the auto withdrawal thing. I feel like I lose control and something like this will happen. I do use bill pay through my bank. Then I control when the money is deducted.
