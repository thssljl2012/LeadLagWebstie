I've never had a problem with my bank except that they take two or three days sometimes to make my deposit "available"....well Friday I deposited my check. ....no problem over the weekend. Monday comes and the bank is closed, so my deposit wasn't 'available' yet...but showing as there.  However, they had no problem putting through all my scheduled bill payments...taking my 'available' balance down below zero..but my actual balance well above zero...    ..note that I just decided to switch over to Bank of America to use their 'keep the change' savings plan.  I had enough money  to start the accounts withdrawn from my current bank  --came out on Monday when the banks were closed.    Wake up this morning to 7 overdraft charges!!...but my 'actual' balance never went below zero..never even came close. I want to see them explain this...do you think it has anything to do with them seeing that i'm switching banks?? This better be fixed in the morning! I didn't have time to call them but I sent them an email through the online banking and they are usually really fast at fixing goof ups...this had better just be a goof up!!
