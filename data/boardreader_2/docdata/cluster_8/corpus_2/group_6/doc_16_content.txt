In other words, I have brought them hundreds of thousands of dollars in business the last 2 years alone.      I get a call from them last week saying my car payment was overdue 32 days. I have someone who handles my finances, including paying my car loan monthly. After checking into this...I find out the person who is handling my finances spent the money instead of paying the loan.         I immediately call BOA and make the late payment. Of course, they reported it as 30 days late to the credit agencies. I have now called them twice to explain the situation and ask them to remove the late payment mark. They refuse. The account manager gave me some BS that they will only do so if it was a bank error....and that they are governed by the Truth in Lending Act and cannot remove the late payment or else they run the risk of getting audited by the government. Pure and utter BS. There is no law requiring ANY CREDITOR to report ANY DEBTOR LATE FOR ANY REASON!       I threatened to refinance my loan with another bank and close my credit cards immediately and they didn't even budge. No wonder they need a bailout......they are willing to let customers who have money and have given them alot of money go for nothing.      I know I would need a bailout if I lost $200k in business because I refused to remove a late payment on a customer's account. I don't like being lied to either (about them being required to report late payments....but then again, what do I know? I only have a law degree).....                      How much did the late payment ding your FICO?
