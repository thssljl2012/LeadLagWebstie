 In the state of VA, debt of both spouses does not need to be considered if only one is buying the property as their sole and separate equitable estate. The non-purchasing spouse does not have to provide any information if the other spouse is purchasing on their own.  Only the purchasing spouse's debts would be considered (and that would include any joint obligations - watch even the 0 balance, joint, revolving accounts).     A couple of things could happen, here. One, you could wind up trashing her credit by loading her up w/ a boatload of revolving debt and tons of hard pulls of her credit. Technically, your score should not be hit, but I would keep a very close eye. If there were joint accounts closed, you bet they are going to pull your credit to see if there is something there they need to be aware of.     I have seen cases where paying off and/or closing accounts with revolving credit have actually harmed scores. If you are intent on attempting to do this, I can't push you towards a credit repair company fast enough. (Note: credit repair does not = bad credit needs to be fixed). You need someone that knows the ins and outs of scoring and the various nuances that go with it. If you are doing most of the work, the 1/2 hour - 1 hour consultation should be a reasonable fee.     Another reason for caution, many lenders will not allow for a rescored credit report. They have to work with the report as it comes into them. Sure, they can get a correction, but many will not accept a total re-work/re-score until 90 days are up. (ie, no rapid re-scoring). (Bank of America is one such lender).     Your questions are revolving around a closely held recipe.  We have most of the ingredients figured out, but you need some specialized assistance.  I do this all day long and I wouldn't begin to try to take on your situation.  Good luck!
