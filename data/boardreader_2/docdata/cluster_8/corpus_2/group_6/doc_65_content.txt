For too long now, runaway capitalism run by greed has made extreme profits for the very few, and has given little back in way of jobs and fair compensation. I have nothing against making a profit, but business should also provide a service for that profit. When those making the profit do not allow the people to also succeed financially, then the people cannot buy the merchandise or services from those same companies... so then the companies alter (as we have seen), and then the people get stuck bailing them out - it has to stop.      Just this morning, we learn that the now former CEO of Merrill Lynch (whom we did bail out indirectly) spent 1.2 million $ to tidy up his office. This same CEO also found it OK to pay out between 3-4 billion (yes Billion) in bonuses after the Bank of America buyout had been confirmed. ML was forced to sell out to Bank of America because of their huge losses in 2008. Bank of America is part of the bail out. They received 15 billion earlier to include help for Merill Lynch, now another 20 billion... 15 billion here, 20 billion there... pretty soon you start talking real money   ... all paid for by the People, while the CEO's squander it away, and move customer service jobs and manufacturing overseas. Corporations need to give something back to the American people so that the people are able to support them and buy their products and services.                      But...But...But...that would make sense?!?!?!
