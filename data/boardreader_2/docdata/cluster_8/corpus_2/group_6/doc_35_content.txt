Went on a Friday, received my Visa checking card via DHL on Tuesday. If you were to lose your checking card, they will mail you a replacement within a week. I received it just as quickly as RBC replacing my bank card.                      Are there any fees associated with the account?  Is there a minimum balance requirement?      Also, what is a VISA Checking Card?  Is that a VISA that draws directly from your chequing account when you make purchases where they accept VISA?      Thanks for sharing...
