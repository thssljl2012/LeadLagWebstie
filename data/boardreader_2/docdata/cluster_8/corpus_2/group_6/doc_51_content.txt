            Quote from: Bmore_2_UK on  Today  at 08:29:02 AM   My credit union charges 3% each time I make a withdrawal from an international ATM. However, if you make a large withdrawal, then deposit that into your UK account the fee wouldn&#039;t be too high. You could check into PayPal which is a simple way of transferring money. There are different plans, but the basic one allows you to transfer $500 per month without charge. You can pay for an upgrade if you think you need more than this. The most expensive route that I&#039;ve found is doing an international wire transfer from your bank. When I transferred some money from the UK to the US, this cost me 30 pounds. Again though, if it&#039;s a large amount of money, the fee would be nominal.    Bank of America will charge $45 per month/per transfer for a wire transfer if done by them on an ongoing monthly basis.  Bank of America will charge $35 per month/per transfer for the same but done and instigated by me.  We only require 1 transfer per month of DH&#039;s Pension which is paid on the 1st of every month.  We would have an ongoing payment of approx $2400 per month (equivalent  by today&#039;s rates would be about 1600 pounds).  Bank of America also said I had a daily withdrawal limit of $1500 from Barclays in the UK.  I think I might ring the Customer Service staff on this one as a young girl in my local branch told me that.  Not saying I don&#039;t believe her, I just would prefer to get a second opinion.  I have thought of Paypal but I am so reluctant to give them too much access to my accounts and money.  I currently have an account linked to them but it has literally $30 in the account so if someone hacks in they only have access to $30.  About 8 yrs ago I had fraud perpetuated on me through Paypal targeting my joint checking account with DH at that time.  They attempted to withdraw over $3,000.  Thankfully my bank manager realized something wasn&#039;t right because we never spend that much in one go and halted the proceedings.  I then called the police, got a police report and reported it to Paypal, I never heard from them and when I tried to access my account with my email I was promptly told my account didn&#039;t exist.  It was all so weird.  1 day later someone tried withdrawing $1600 form my own personal account in a different bank altogether which wasn&#039;t even linked to Paypal.  It was all very strange.  I guess they could have accessed all the data through my computer but I didn&#039;t do any online banking at the time and everything was done in person.  Police never did get to the bottom of it and I never felt comfortable again with Paypal.  It took me another 6 yrs to to get the balls to deal with my Paypal account again.  And get this..........my old account was suddenly available to me again 6yrs later,  I just typed in my old email and old password and bingo I was able to access Paypal again.  All very strange.  You can see why I&#039;m very reluctant to deal with them.  Anyone out there have any other suggestions other than what we have talked about here.  What about a US Bank that has easy dealings with a UK Bank.  I have seen on here stuff about HSBC, what do y&#039;all think of them or Barclays.  I really am just looking for the best, safest, cheapest way to access DH&#039;s Pension for everyday needs in the UK transferring the money on a monthly basis.  I have a very limited account with Lloyds Bank, they refused to let me close it in 2006.  I did however manage to close my Abbey National Account.  Didn&#039;t think I was ever coming back to the UK then.  My.......how things change.  I will probably have trouble getting another different Bank Account and I imagine Barclays not being too receptive.  They refused me a bank account when I was a worker and living there in my late teens/early 20&#039;s.  In fact to get my Abbey National Account my father co-signed the account and the a couple of yrs later we took him off.  The only reason I have a Lloyds Bank Account is because the Royal Navy opened it on my behalf when I joined up.  Are the UK Banks still stick in the muds when it comes to opening an account?  I can&#039;t imagine my Mum &amp; Dad having to Co-Sign a bank account for DH &amp; I at our ages, how embarrassing.
