                                 In reply to:   Is this what we have to look forward to?     For now, it appears so. There are changes slated for 2010, but don't count on them, as the CC companies have big lobby forces and will be working to modify those requirements before they go into affect.  It is sad that those that use Credit responsibly, and try to stay on top of their accounts, are getting slammed because of those that have run up humongous balances with NO real intent of paying them off.    Good luck to you and maybe when ready, you can get a card from your credit union where they may be a bit more willing to work with you than a big bank where you are more of a number. [Note, not all CU are created equal, and they are less personal in many cases than years ago. Many of us, use Pentagon Federal  -- "PenFed".]     There is a difference between having debt and having credit. If you don't know the difference, don't try to use credit.
