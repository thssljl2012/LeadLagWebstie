           Advertisements [ ? ]                             In his inaugural address, President Barack Obama shared a simple, powerful message: the era of greed and irresponsibility is over.  Judging from his actions, though, Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis must not have been listening.  Bank of America tellers make about $24,000 a year. That's less than what the CEO of a company bought by Bank of America paid for his curtains during the $1.2 million redecoration of his personal office.  Enough is enough. Bank of America must fire Ken Lewis.  On Thursday, our brothers and sisters from SEIU will be going to Bank of America locations the country to talk directly with employees about what's happening with their company - and why their CEO should be fired. I urge you to join them in this grassroots effort:      * Click here to find an event near you on Thursday  If there aren't any events planned in your area, create your own at a Bank of America branch near you.  News reports say that Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis turned a blind eye when one of his new acquisitions doled out billions in executive pay in 2008 -- including an estimated $4 billion in bonuses -- right before the company got its $10 billion bailout from the government.  Workers across America are going to Bank of America locations around the country on Thursday because the employees of the largest bank in the country need to hear the truth about their CEO.  Let's be clear: it won't be enough to replace Ken Lewis with someone equally reckless. After Bank of America replaces its CEO, the company needs to use its $45 billion bailout money responsibly. We're asking the company to:      * Provide health care for its 247,000 workers     * Keep over 12,000 troubled borrowers in their homes with bonus money     * Sign new leases with renters who live in buildings that are being foreclosed upon     * Commit to providing affordable healthcare to all of its employees and their dependents  It seems Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis forgot about the 247,000 people that make his company successful. In 2006, Lewis took home $99 million, more than 4,000 times what his average employee makes. In some states, Bank of America employees take up large portions of public health care because they don't earn enough money.  Someone needs to stand with Bank of America employees to help them get a fair shake. That's where you and I come in:      * Join an action at your local Bank of America location on Thursday  Thanks for all that you do,  Chris Chafe Executive Director, Change to Win                           ...
