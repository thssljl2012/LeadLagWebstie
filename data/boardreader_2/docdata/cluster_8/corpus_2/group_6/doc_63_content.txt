 The time has come to hold the line. The large banks like Bank of America should be allowed to go bankrupt also. When I see 51.62 percent rate on my visa card I feel that the robber is at my door. I pay my bill each month so I avoid such a hit but that rate is insane. The Auto industry was given a token amount and the Banking Industry was given a whole lot. Let it stop there and let the Wall Street swingers take the hit.
