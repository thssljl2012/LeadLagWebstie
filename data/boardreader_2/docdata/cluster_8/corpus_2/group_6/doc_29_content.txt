We have military banking with Bank of America. It all goes into our primary checking account. My DH took his check card for the secondary account with him on deployment and every pay day, on his preference, I make sure the account has $100 in it for his to do what he wants. If he needs more than that he lets me know. I pay our bills, keep $100 in the primary account for myself and transfer the rest into our savings.    It sounds complicated, but I have a job too, so I'm not actually spending the money he earns.  He has the card to the secondary account in case he loses it or it gets stolen, they don't have access to our money except for the little that's in there. Savings is savings! We have a lot of it.    P.S. The 100 I allow myself is my own doing. I've always been like that though. I don't like spending money and I feel guilty when I do. My parents raised me to be smart with my money and being poor right after college has taught me a lot!
