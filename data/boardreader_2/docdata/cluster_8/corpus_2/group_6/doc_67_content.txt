Does this only apply to the debit card....      I found it interesting when I worked there that all debits (including checks) were posted to the account prior to any credits from the same buisness day.  Which in turn provided the bank with a lot of overdraft fees even though had the items been posted in reverse order there would have been adequate funds.
