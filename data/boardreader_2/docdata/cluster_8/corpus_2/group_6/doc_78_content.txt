then your next 2 tanks of gas are on them!        There's now a chance to exact a little revenge by getting up to $78 back from Bank of America as part of a class-action lawsuit recently settled by Bank of America and any of the banks it acquired between 2000 and 2007, according to SmartMoney story (link below).      The lawsuit, settled for $35 million, alleged that the bank failed to warm customers that transactions were triggering fees, and that it changed the posting order of transactions and embarked on other activities in order to increase revenue from non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft fees and similar charges.      Bank of America denies any wrongdoing and is agreeing to pay up to $78 per account holder.       Story:  http://www.smartmoney.com/Spending/D...in-Settlement/
