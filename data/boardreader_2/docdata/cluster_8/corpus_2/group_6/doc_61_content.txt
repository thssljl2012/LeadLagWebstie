 AMEN to Crying Tree's comments! When I see (on my latest Visa Statement) that the Bank of America is now charging 51.62 percent on visa cards which are not paid up I think the time has come to nationalize the largest of the large banks. Also, eliminate all the store front "PayDay" loan sharks that have appeared on many of our streets.
