I'll take my money elsewhere.                      +1    I used to trade FX for one of the large banks downtown.  But when I left I moved all my accounts to a much smaller bank that actually needs and appreciates my business.  Not knocking BofA specifically, just the 'ginormous' (my word  ) banking machine.
