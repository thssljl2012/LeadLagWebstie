Is it just me or does anyone else find it coincidental that on dec 8 he said the state would stop dealing with the bank of america and on dec 9th there are charges laid against him and no more news about the banking situation.Now I do not claim to have followed all of his governorship, but to me the coincidence in timing is amazing. In a time of financial crisis a story as big as a state dropping its dealings with a bank, and there has been no more news on it because the day after he was charged. just a thought from the outside
