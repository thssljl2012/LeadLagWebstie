Sorry I just have to vent.  Monday my wife had a doctor's appointment and it cost more than we were expecting.  They would not take a check therefore I used my bank card.  It put my account into the red so I transferred money to cover the charge from my savings.  I had two charges for 15 and 10 dollars over the weekend that were pending along with the doctor's visit. Yesterday I see that I have an overdraft fee for the two weekend charges that cleared after the deposit.  So I call Bank of America and the lady tells me when the money hit the account I had insufficient funds.  I told the lady if that is how it works then I owe you thousands of dollars for the past 5 years I have been with you.  I have used my bank card as credit a ton of times that brought my account in the red and deposited money to cover the charge with no overdraft fee.  Well last night with the little money I had left after the other two charges I went to buy groceries and something from Lowes.  Well I check my bank account this morning and guess what.  I now have an overdraft fee for the doctor's visit which takes my groceries and Lowes charge into the red.  I called Bank of America and asked them again and told them what has occured and they tell me the same thing.  I was not as kind to this man and told him I am absolutely finished with Bank of Thieves!!  If that is how things happened in the past I could understand, but this was not consistent with the past 5 years, which in turn I have lost $175 for nothing!! It just stings a bit!! Thanks for listening!!  Now I feel better!!   Have a great day!!
