Many old jobs are gone, but we need to create new jobs and open new markets.   Obama's budget is about that, not just investing in the war.        I have repeatedly stated we should reinstate the CCC and/or the WPA or similar programs - gives people work and does fix the infastructure in the US of A        I was also pleased to hear that this administration is acting on the banks/credit card companies and preventing them from creating another false bubble via inflation of interest rates and fees.         The credit card thing is the second shoe waiting to fall - the average person has 7 - 9 credit cards and the average debt is $7,400 - many people are living off credit cards and when they lose their job these debts go unpaid -      This is from Bloomberg News:    Credit-card lenders have boosted fees and interest rates as U.S. unemployment rose to 8.5 percent in March, the highest since 1983. Defaults on credit cards historically rise and fall with the jobless rate, and   Bank of America reported $182 billion in card loans as of Dec. 31, according to data from American Express Co. The bank wrote off $11.4 billion of uncollectible card balances last year.          If the banks are allowed to continue with the same old ways it's only a matter of time before the cc debt is added to the toxic assets.  We have a tendency to want quick fixes and instant gratification.  Our recovery will take hard work.  The banks need to work hard too.  Raising interest rates is the same as raising taxes on the middle class.       Bank are NOT a "non profit" organization - I don't like some of the games they are playing with interest rates and credit limits but they have "risks" they face - see above - however none of this changes the basic premis of my post - times will be tough and we will NOT see the return to the "good ole days" in the next decade or so                                           &gt;&gt;&gt;
