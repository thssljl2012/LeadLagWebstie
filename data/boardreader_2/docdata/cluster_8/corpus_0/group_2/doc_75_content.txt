If you&amp;#8217;re looking for a high yield savings alternative and won&amp;#8217;t need to touch your money for a year, Washington Mutual is currently offering a pretty attractive 12 month online CD. Here&amp;#8217;s the scoop&amp;#8230; The APY is 4.50%, and the minimum to open is $1000. Also, there is an early withdrawal penalty of 90 days worth of interest &amp;#8212; not huge, but your effective rate would take a hit if you don&amp;#8217;t leave your money in place for the full year. While WaMu has made their share of headlines in the wake of the subprime meltdown, these CDs are FDIC insured, so just be sure to stay under the limits ($100k/individual/bank) and you should be fine. I should also note that they offer a savings account that pays 3.75% APY. While you don&amp;#8217;t need technically need an account with them to take advantage of the CD offer, having one makes funding the CD easier, and will also minimize downtime on the backend when the CD matures. As an aside, they were actually offering 5.00% APY through the end of August, but dropped the rate a bit for September. A bit disappointing, but the 4.50% APY still beats everything else on Bankrate&amp;#8217;s list of top-yielding 12 month CDs by at least 0.35%. This rate is also substantially better than current rates for online bank accounts. ---Related Articles at fivecentnickel.com:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&amp;nbsp;The Safest Online Banks: Is Your Savings Account in Jeopardy?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&amp;nbsp;Favorite Mutual Fund Company?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&amp;nbsp;$10 AT&amp;#038;T DSL for New Subscribers&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&amp;nbsp;Banks and Fraud: Bank of America Better Than Expected?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&amp;nbsp;Possible Vanguard Auto-Investment Gotcha&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&amp;nbsp;Hosting&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&amp;nbsp;Favorite Mutual Fund Companies: The Results&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;raquo;&amp;nbsp;Stocks and Bonds vs. Mutual Funds
