So, I guess there was some sort of stock market hoo-ha recently.The biggest drop since 2001 yesterday?  Is that what it said?I checked my portfolio, it didn't move yesterday.Today, it's made a bigger single day jump (up) in I don't know how many months (years?).Strange times.In related news, it seems that Bank of America is going through a lot of trouble to get me back as a customer.  I ditched them as a bank years ago, after they bought out my NationsBank account.  A couple years ago, they bought out my Motley Fool credit card from MBNA.  And now they're buying the company that has one of my 401(k) accounts.  I try to get out, but they keep pulling me back in.In other financially-related news, I just got a kick-ass performance review.  I performed, if you catch my drift.  The drift of doing well in my job, not that other thing.  Perv.
