This is kinda long, at least for me.&amp;nbsp;  There has been a lot of talk, lately, about the bailout.&amp;nbsp; Personally, I have&amp;nbsp;a lot to say about the situation and I wanted to shed some light on my own perspective.&amp;nbsp; I work for a large brokerage firm, so I got a firsthand look at what happened in the industry over the last year or so. For those who dont know, it started with loan agents (Countrywide, WaMu) giving out home loans with little or no discretion to people who maybe could not afford them in the long run.&amp;nbsp; So, what happens with corporations - in order to raise capital, they sell securities in the form of bonds or stock to people or other corporations.&amp;nbsp; In this particular case, lets take Countrywide, they bundled the home loans and sold them to Goldman Sachs.&amp;nbsp; But, the serious downfall was when people began to default on their loans and these newly created securites were worth NOTHING, because there was no money behind them. So, now here we have large corporations: Goldman Sachs, Countrywide, Fannie &amp;amp; Freddie, Lehman Brothers, etc.&amp;nbsp; Who own millions and millions of home loans that arent worth shit. Which caused them to go out of business because they didnt have enough capital to cover their day to day business.&amp;nbsp; Now, with all of them going out of business.... What to do? The Fed Bank saw this coming, which is why they sent out those stimulus checks, also why they cut interest rates so much.&amp;nbsp; They were trying to get the consumer to keep spending money which would keep the banks in business, also the lower interest rates would encourage banks to loan and borrow money, keeping our economy going. Unfortunately, it wasnt enough.&amp;nbsp; Now, here we are - our Government wants to prepare a bailout package to help those large corporations because money is not moving in and out of them like it should. Personally, I say HELL NAW.&amp;nbsp; Nobody told these people to take these risks.&amp;nbsp; They gave CEO multi-million dollar bonuses, hedge funds took advantage of the rise in crude which eventually led&amp;nbsp;runs on banks, etc etc.&amp;nbsp; Now, we, the PEOPLE, have to use money that we dont have, to bail out banks and large corporations for doing shit they had no business doin anyway. So, what happens if they do it?&amp;nbsp; In theory, (meaning this shit might not work) what should happen is banks will be able to lend other banks money, the large&amp;nbsp;corporations&amp;nbsp;should have enough cash on hand to handle day to day business,&amp;nbsp;stocks would go back up, restoring&amp;nbsp;people's 401(k) investments and money can be&amp;nbsp;made again, causing our economy to end this recession. What happens if it doesnt work, or if they dont do it.&amp;nbsp; Well, here is some serious danger.&amp;nbsp; Banks wont have any money, so they wont be able to lend other banks or corporations any money, if they dont have money - where do you get your money from????&amp;nbsp; If you're lucky - you have a job that doesnt&amp;nbsp;depend on Wall Street, but your MONEY does depend on banks.&amp;nbsp; What happens when you walk into your neighborhood Wells Fargo and they say, "Sorry, but we dont have any&amp;nbsp;cash to&amp;nbsp;give you"?&amp;nbsp; Or what happens when the large corporation that you work for sends your direct deposit to a bank that doesnt exist?&amp;nbsp;  What happens is another Depression.&amp;nbsp; The Fed could continue to lower rates, hoping to encourage money flow, at the same time producing and letting more cash enter the economy - causing inflation. I know, its&amp;nbsp;scary, but it is a&amp;nbsp;very real possibility.&amp;nbsp; You can run to Bank of America and take out all&amp;nbsp;your cash, but&amp;nbsp;what happens when you have a basket full of cash that isnt worth anything?&amp;nbsp; People everywhere are saying, fuck Wall Street, let them deal with the mess they made.&amp;nbsp; But that mess eventually affects YOU and ME.&amp;nbsp; If you own stocks, if you have a 401(k), if your employer is a publicly-traded company, if you live in an area where the housing slump hit, if you are employed by a small business (they wont be able to get home loans).&amp;nbsp;  Lets say you dont fall into any of the above categories.&amp;nbsp; You have a decent credit history, you pay your mortgage on time, you are employed by a financially stable company... What happens in 2 years when you want to buy a car?&amp;nbsp; You'll be paying $75,000 for a $20,000 car because of interest rates or because a bank cant afford to give you a loan.&amp;nbsp; There will be millions and millions of Americans who will be in a really bad position, jobs will be lost, more homes will be lost and there will be more shit to worry about, besides an economy. So, I'm not exactly in favor of this $700 billion bailout, but we have to do something, soon.
