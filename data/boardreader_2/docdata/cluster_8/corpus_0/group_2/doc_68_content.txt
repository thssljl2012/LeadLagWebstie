I dunno. With all the hemming and hawing about the ECONOMY!!!1! I just find it very hard to really get into a twist about it. My accounts are stable, (and I have 70 percent of my assets in the stock market), I have a REITs fund actually creeping upward in spite of the market, and one of the banks I have an account in might be bought out by another bank which makes me go &amp;quot;whatever&amp;quot; considering that they were another bank when I first opened the account. (I think comparing a buyout to a collapse is rather misleading. The only reason the Merrill Lynch buyout surprised me was because I didn't think Bank of America was that big to do that).I'm reading all the articles but all I get from them is that you really should worry only if you're an investment banker, an actual bank shareholder or deeply in real estate.Is there something I'm not getting? I guess I'll fill everyone on my position after November, eh?
