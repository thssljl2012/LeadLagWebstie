 I really not happy received email which is scam and spam. Here comes another one... earlier I have also received one from a person who claimed himself as a doctor. I got the same email with different title from this doc more than 5 times. If I got it again will post it.Dear Valued Customer :              We recently have determined that different computers have logged in your Bank of America Online Banking account, and multiple password failures were present before the logons.
