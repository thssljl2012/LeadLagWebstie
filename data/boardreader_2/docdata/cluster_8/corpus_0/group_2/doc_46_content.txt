I've used many banks (fleet, people's, webster, etc., etc.), and I have never, ever been more satisfied with Bank of America.I received an e-mail from them today asking me to review my account activity, and phone them, because they had noticed suspicious behaviour on my account.Now, of course, I was suspicious of the e-mail, first, so, I just opened my online banking, without clicking on the link in the e-mail.I did not notice anything, to tell the truth, but, I called the bank, using the service number on their website, and they patched me through to the proper department.Their was suspicious activity!  I didn't even notice!There was a $2.95 purchase from MLB.com (major league baseball), that I never made.I don't watch professional sports...Never have...They girl at the bank explained that when people steal your card no., the make a small purchase, first, to see if it's going to work.They caught it right away, and shut down my card, and are sending another.Thank the gods!I currently have thousands of dollars in that account...Like two months income.Heck, so far this month, I've had about $14,000.00 in deposits to the account...(some checks, other wire transfers from clients).(I get it like that sometimes...I don't get paid for anything for a month or two, then suddenly all my money appears at once).I have transferred all of my dough to my business account, so I have access to it while waiting for a new card to arrive.But, I'm still shaking my head here...absolutely amazed that Bank of America caught this $2.95 purchase from www.mlb.com, and began investigating the matter right  away...I mean, this is the USA.  People like baseball here!But, they, apparently, recognized that, in the 4 years I have used their bank, I have never purchased anything remotely related to MLB, or other sports.And, of course, she explained the MO of these cro0ks that steal your card no., then make a small purchase as a test.Now, the question is, who got my card number, and how?The girl said it was probably in a restaurant, like a waiter, or something...I got to thinking...I purchased a grocery cart thing yesterday in a small odds-n-ends store that opened close to home just within the last two months...It's the only place I've made a purchase recently that I have not frequented for a long time, and trust.Heck, I never go anywhere.  I make regular purchases at Walgreens in Shaws, and occasionally CVS, and couple of local take-out places, all of whom I have patronized for over a year without issue.And the guy at this store held my card unusually long to make the purchase, and, he had a swiper thing, but didn't allow me to swipe the card, but rather took the card from my hand to do it himself...That's got me wondering now...Of course, I don't know anything for certain, so, I won't mention where the store is...I don't want to cause problems for a local business needlessly, based only on suspicion.
