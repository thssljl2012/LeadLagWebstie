PRIMERICA!!!! I got a new, awesome job at a company called Primerica Financial Services. It is amazing, and I'm gonna make BANK!!!! So my job title is "Financial Analyst/Broker" and basically what I do is help middle-class families get out of debt. But the amazing thing is that I am my own boss, I make my own hours, I work when I want to, and I make hella bank! This company is the 1 financial corporation in the world, they have offices worldwide, and they are worth more than Hilton, GM, Ford, Disney, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Cheverolet all put together!!! Sweet! So starting off part-time, I'm making about $12,000 a month, and that's only working about&amp;nbsp;5-10 hours a week! And to top it all off, the best part is that I'm helping people in the process. I came from a middle-class family, and the 1st thing that popped into my head when I got hired was, " I'll be making enough money to where my parents wont have to work anymore. I'll buy them a house and they can retire." They've worked hard my entire life and never really got much out of it. So thats my first goal: retire the folks! Anyhoo! Just wanted to let y'all know whats up. Yay me!!!
