 Ok, well this country is really freaking me out now!! Wamu has gone under as of thursday night when the government seized control of WAMU and sold most of it to JP Morgan Chase. As of Friday, Wamu is Now Jp Morgan Chase, and all logos websites, checks, atm cards, credit cards, savings, checking accounts will slowly within a 6month time frame will change from Wamu, to Jp Morgan chase. THE FDIC took a hold of the bank and "bailed out" some of its debt, and JP Morgan Chase bought the rest of the bank along with all its customers and wamu branches. You can keep using everythuing wamu but you it will all eventually change and well be reisued new cards, checks and what not. I think im closing my savings account with wamu and keeping my money at home, sadly im looosing trust in ALL banks, and if it eventually gets worse for this country and you can no longer use credit cards or any cards, remember that Cash is KING, its not just a saying its true if it comes down to it. So be carefull with money, im officially not spending as I use to, looking back on stuff i have wasted so much money on entertainment and food and other stuff, but right now we all have to tighten that belt, because slowly well feel the crunch of the troubled economy. Hope all is well with you all, and I also heard Bank of America is doing ok now, but they are a bit risky, sadly for wells fargo to, so just be watchfull.
