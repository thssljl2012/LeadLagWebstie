I am going to oz in jan to validate my visa,i been looking into opening an bank account with westpac before i go in the uk and once i am there collect the stuff or finish the application. I am not sure what types of accounts there are right now,with opening from the uk,i did get some info about it way back from hifx when i was applying for my visa but was not ready back then,and im sure what ever info was sent back then im sure accounts have changed etc.  But i hear that you pay monthly fees when the account is open,or start paying money into it.I also believe there maybe accounts with no fees and also accounts with fees for using atms and accounts with no fees for atms.  Anyone lately opened an account from within uk and what did it offer as in the fees etc and what was the accounts called. I am pretty much looking for a card that has mastercard or visa logo on it,debit card type card which i can use online as well as in shops there and overseas,just like the debit cards we get here. What are these accounts called,and do i need to ask for them or are you just offered what they give you?  I also think telephone banking might play an important part of this and online banking,so could someone tell me how i apply and what account i look for etc.  Also im sure i have a link of being able to get a credit card from them too,can this be done before i head to oz in jan,or do you need to have been over there for a while and have had wages paid into the bank,would be good if i could get both debit cards and credit cards set up before i went there.  As for when i be there full time,i will be returning back home in feb a month later from validation and probably be about 1 yr later i make my move,but i do have a 176 visa etc.
