  Dear Mr. Lewis: Your Bank of America Web site has the obligatory &amp;#8220;Chairman&amp;#8217;s letter,&amp;#8221; which reads: &amp;#8220;Bank of America helps build strong communities bycreating opportunities for people  including customers, shareholders and associates  to fulfill their dreams.&amp;#8221; Please allow me to share my dream with you. My dream is to expect minimal customer service and common sense from my bank. To deal with a bank that does not force me to telephone them FOUR separate times over a period of months with one simple request only to have the bank fail to do what they promised and ultimately to have a bank representative cite ridiculous and inane policy. And to have a relationship with a bank that can do a simple thing because it is not unrealistic or unreasonable. That is indeed a dream, or, on second thought a nightmare&amp;#8211;at least if that bank is Bank of America, your bank, Sir. A bank that is of this moment, the most useless, ridiculous, frustrating, and pathetic bank on the face of the earth in my humble opinion. All I asked was that your bank replace my current MasterCard with a simple generic card, thus replacing the current affinity card I now have. Your bank cannot do that, Mr. Lewis. So I am told. Your bank instead would have me re-apply for a credit card. I wish I was joking. I could just take some sandpaper and remove the sports team logo that is currently on my card. And maybe I will. Because your bank can&amp;#8217;t simply send me a new card without that logo. Your bank is that inept, that inane, that incompetent. Bank of America doesn&amp;#8217;t understand the meaning of customer &amp;#8220;service.&amp;#8221; You&amp;#8217;ve proven that to me on four separate occasions. So I will simply take my credit card businss elsewhere. To a bank that can still handle a simple request. To a financial institution that is not so big, so corporate, so cold and bogged-down in ludicrous corporate rules and policies that it has lost all touch with reality. I can only assume you are partly responsible for that, Mr. Lewis. This type of thing comes from the top down. But I&amp;#8217;m sure you don&amp;#8217;t have to actually deal with your own bank on a customer level. If you did, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t be so annoyed with your bank right now because I dare say that you wouldn&amp;#8217;t permit such stupidity to reign supreme at Bank of America. So pardon me, Mr. Lewis, if I don&amp;#8217;t buy your statement. It&amp;#8217;s simply corporate copywriting bullshit. The reality is that Bank of America isn&amp;#8217;t really interested in its customers, or their dreams, and certainly not customer service. Itis only interested in making money. Bank of America&amp;#8217;s actions speak far louder than your words. Bank of America&amp;#8217;s customer service should be placed in the Customer Service Hall of Shame. If you don&amp;#8217;t believe me, take a stroll from your plush Ivory Tower executive offices down to Customer Service and take a phone call or two and find out for yourself. Earn that ridiculous salary. And try to remember why your bank exists, Sir. It&amp;#8217;s not because of you. It&amp;#8217;s because of your customers. You just might be surprised to find out how your bank is treating them these days. Signed,  An annoyed and alienated and soon-to-be former customer of Bank of America. That&amp;#8217;s not a dream. That&amp;#8217;s reality.
