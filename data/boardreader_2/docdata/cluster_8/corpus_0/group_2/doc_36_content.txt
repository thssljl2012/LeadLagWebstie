      My hat's off for the fine sense of humour of the British. From the classic "Monty Python" to the more recent "Trigger Happy TV" and masterpieces like "The Office" or "Extras", the British always manage to put a big smile on my face wheres U.S. versions (when avaialble) of the same programmes put me to sleep.Again, I don't know how they do it, but my hat's off to the irreverent British humour.----According to a BBC report, Lloyds TSB customer Steve Jetley set his password to "Lloyds is pants" following an insurance-related disagreement. He was surprised - though amused - to discover it had been changed to "no it's not".The BBC quoted Jetley as saying "But what really incensed me was when I was told I could not change it back to 'Lloyds is pants' because they said it was not appropriate. I asked if it was 'pants' they didn't like, and would 'Lloyds is rubbish' do? But they didn't think so. So I tried 'Barclays is better' and that didn't go down too well either."-----iTWire - UK bank pulls down pants passwordhttp://www.itwire.com/content/view/20359/53/FCLabels: british, HUMOR
