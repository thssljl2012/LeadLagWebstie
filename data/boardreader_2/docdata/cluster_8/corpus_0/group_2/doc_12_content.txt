There is one thing that I have learned more about this year, than anything else.&amp;nbsp; Thanks to Ron Paul, Peter Schiff, and other Economists, there is a huge problem going on in this country (and it will soon trickle to around the world) regarding our Economy.Many people have probably heard about the Sub-Prime Mortgage problem, but do you know what it actually means?&amp;nbsp; Here is an article about what that is and why it's such a big deal:What is a sub-prime lender?Now realize, that all companies are in the business of making money.&amp;nbsp; So, when you have lenders that will lend money to people who shouldn't be qualified in the first place, you know there is something wrong.Secondly there is also the problem of people not saving as much money as they used to.&amp;nbsp; Which leads to another point that Economists are calling, "The Credit Crunch."&amp;nbsp; What is that?&amp;nbsp; Basically it means that more and more Americans are using Credit to get buy on pretty much everything they need.&amp;nbsp; Whether it be food, clothing, shelter, etc.&amp;nbsp; But what has happened, is many people are living beyond their means.&amp;nbsp; So, what do they do in order to keep living where they're at....borrow more credit.&amp;nbsp; Ahhhh, but here is the kicker, if people can't pay that off, then what happens.&amp;nbsp; They'll more than likely file for bankruptcy or have their stuff repossessed.&amp;nbsp; Here are a couple of news articles I found about that:Credit Crunch changes everyday life in the U.S.Credit Crunch Stalls U.S. Auto IndustryEconomist states that the Credit Crunch will get worseThis article explains what a Credit Crunch actually is:Credit CrunchNow, here is something else to keep in mind.&amp;nbsp; Because of the housing problems and the Credit Crunch, what other entity could be affected.....Banks!Banks as everyone knows lends out money on loans more often than not, but where does it get the backing for that money in case the loan defaults....it comes from people putting their money in the bank to save it.&amp;nbsp; These banks today have collapsed and or got bought out:Stocks tumble amid new Wall Street landscapeWith Lehman bankruptcy, others on brink the question becomes, 'What's next?'In other words folks, we need to keep an eye on this shit.Also, we need to keep an eye on AIG one of the biggest insurance companies in America and also Washington Mutual Bank, which I believe is the 4th largest in the nation.So folks, we need to become more in tuned with what is going on with our Economy.
