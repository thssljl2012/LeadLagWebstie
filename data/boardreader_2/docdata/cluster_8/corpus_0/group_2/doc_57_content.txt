Citizen's Bank has lost its fight with me.  Kristen 1, Citizen's Bank 0.Dear Kristen Risley, Thank you for your follow up email and your feedback. We appreciate the time you took to express your thoughts and for providing us with the opportunity to respond.  Please be assured that as a valued customer of Citizens Bank, our commitment is to provide you with the highest level of customer service and consistently exceed your expectations.  We are sorry that, in this instance, we did not meet that goal.  We very much value our relationship with you, and, going forward, will strive to restore your confidence in Citizens Bank. We apologize that ATM deposit envelopes were not available for your to make a deposit.  However, per your original email, you were aware that your account had already become overdrawn.  Funds need to be deposited prior to the account balance becoming overdrawn A deposit after the account is overdrawn will not prevent the overdraft fees from being assessed.   As you depend on ATM deposits to manage your account due to your work schedule, you may wish to keep a few ATM deposit envelopes in your possession to avoid this situation in the future. If you have any further questions or concerns, please contact us via email or by calling our 24-hour Customer Service Center at 800 922-9999. Thank you for using our Online Banking Services. Sincerely,  S. PalmerEmail Team Advocate
