The Web site for Bank of America was down on Monday for some customers, a spokeswoman for the bank said. Tara Burke cited &amp;#8220;temporary systems issues&amp;#8221; and declined to say what the cause was or whether it was related to Bank of America&amp;#8217;s proposed purchase of Merrill Lynch or other recent turmoil on Wall Street. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;ve had sporadic interruption of online banking service. It doesn&amp;#8217;t impact customer information, just the ability to access it,&amp;#8221; she said. &amp;#8220;We are continuing to correct the error. The site should return shortly.&amp;#8221; The site had been down for several hours as of midday Pacific time, according to Burke. More
