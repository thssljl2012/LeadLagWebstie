If you&amp;#8217;ve been thinking of applying                              for a low interest credit card, you                              have to realize that not everyone is easily approved.                              These offers are best for individuals with good to                              excellent credit. These credit cards do have introductory                              offers such as 0% balance transfer rates and also                              0% purchase rates, however all have a long term low interest rate. There are other factors that are important                              when considering this type of credit card, most notably                              being if there is an annual fee applicable. The annual                              fee will increase your cost of borrowing,                              the rate with which this increases will depend on                              your actual credit card balance. This should be taken                              into account before applying for this type of credit                              card. However, other factors, including 0%                              balance transfers and 0% purchases, have a positive                              effect on your credit card APR and if used properly                              can help cut your borrowing rate, but only                              for the introductory period!
