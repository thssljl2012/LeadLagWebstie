 A guy in England who banks at Lloyds tried to change his password to "Lloyds is pants" [If you're British, I guess that means Lloyds is garbage]When he tried to use it, he discovered the bank had taken it upon itself to change his password to "No it's not." He asked if he could change it back.  They said it was inappropriate.He asked if could change it to "Lloyds is rubbish."  They said no.He tried "Barclays is better". No. In fact, Lloyds suddenly said that passwords could only be a single word.He offered "censorship".Lloyds then said that passwords could not be more than six letters long.
