  I have to say that today's been a terrible day for trading for the average schmuck.  I say that with all the respect for all the other investors that had the same issues.   Here's the deal.  It started yesterday when I was watching one financial bank as a possible buy.   Now, you would imagine that transfers of money should be instant internally between an financial institution, but it isn't.   Takes a day if it's not checking or savings.  Strike 1 for the average person.  Then today, I placed an order pre-market.   Due to financial stocks bringing unusual volume, three different services that I know of after conferring with a friend went down.  Bank of America Investment Services, Zecco, and ING Sharebuilder.  With one of these services, I actually was on hold for over ten minutes for broker services.   That's ridiculous when I remember back in the day with Netvest, I had immediate access to my account through my broker.   Eventually, I find out that my pre-market order did indeed place even though I had absolutely no access to it since the online services went down.  So the moral of this story?   Load balancing and scaling design is extremely important.   If you can't handle either a surge of traffic, or even connections, then something isn't right.   Especially if you're a large online investment brokerage and on one of the hottest days of trading, your services fail.  Not exactly a pretty sign.  Will I still use them?   Of course.   But it also teaches me that if I want to make moves like the big boys, I need to get a direct line to a personal broker.   Investment opportunities always flare up at different moments, but bad design for scaling for these types of services fairly limits the average person's ability to invest optimally.
