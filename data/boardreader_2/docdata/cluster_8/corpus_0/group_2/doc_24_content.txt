Although we will have no say in how this trillion dollar bailout will go. I think we should at least look at how we could have really made this work for the people.ONE: Set a 2 year moratorium on foreclosures for all mortgages bought up, by the government, in the bailout.TWO: The government will then renegotiate the loans at current home values for fixed rate loan's at current rates for 30 or more years if necessary to insure long term home ownership. We, the people, will in essence be buying our homes back from the banks at pennies on the dollar, granted maybe sliced up into a whole lot of Bologna, but don't worry banks, we'll figure it out.THREE: Use the infrastructure of AIG (American Insurance Group) to establish a National Insurance Trust Fund. Everyone pays in with taxes and everyone is covered in the event of a life emergency. floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes. How much do you pay for insurance a year? How much of that is insurance company profit? How much is CEO pay?
