In twelve years of banking I have been with Wells Fargo, Bank of America and WaMu. Of all of them I have to say I have enjoyed WaMu the best. Sure, I had a bumpy ride with them at first (They issued some checks with the wrong account number and all my checks bounced.) but all and all it has been grand. Well, last week they were taken over by Chase and now the process of getting rid of all the WaMu goodness has started. I got a message today that in the next siz months we will start seeing new checks and ATM cards that say "Chase".I will miss my wonderful bank...
