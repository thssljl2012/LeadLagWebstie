Thinking about making a run on your bank from the privacy of your own home? If you're a Bank of America customer, good luck &amp;mdash; the site has been down since 8 a.m. PST, and the problem has seems to have grown worse since it started. At first, users couldn't verify their "SiteKey" to access their accounts. The company then disabled online access and posted a note to the homepage, pictured. I couln't even access the homepage until just now, possibly because millions of customers are now desperately checking and re-checking the site to see when access is restored. Now that I can get in, it looks like I still have some money! So don't panic &amp;mdash; I'm sure Bank of America, like the rest of America's financial services industry, has everything under control.
