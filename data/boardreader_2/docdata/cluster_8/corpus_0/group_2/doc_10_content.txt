 I guess the US Government is now AIG is still selling insurance:And I also got another offer for 0.00% APR on a new credit card today.I always wondered how they could keep giving out those pre-approved credit cards. Now I understand. The rules were designed to grant everyone credit, regardless of one's creditworthiness.Laws cannot be written ex post facto.  But if any laws were broken, I hope the individuals will be held accountable.Tim White
