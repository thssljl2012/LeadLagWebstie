   Dear Barclaycard      It&amp;#8217;s been good. Well it was good. You were first to kiss me with the magic of credit when I came to this land like a lost stranger. You&amp;#8217;ve treated me mostly well, but lately you seem to have lost interest. You wont call me on my mobile, you only leave messages when I&amp;#8217;m out. You don&amp;#8217;t seem to want to email. And when I want to buy stuff you kick up a fuss and leave me looking like a fool in the store.      Frankly I&amp;#8217;ve had enough. I&amp;#8217;m going to try a threesome with Halifax and that cute Virgin Amex number. They&amp;#8217;ve been much more interested in showing me a good time.      I&amp;#8217;m sorry. You&amp;#8217;re ditched.      Yours truly with no regrets   Sevitz  I&amp;#8217;ve had my credit card stolen exactly zero times. I&amp;#8217;ve had fraud on my account exactly zero times.  I have however had my credit card blocked a good 2-3 dozen times. Perhaps more.  Now I have no problem with Barclaycard being virulent vigilant against fraud. Although I&amp;#8217;m not fooled, this isn&amp;#8217;t about protecting me, it&amp;#8217;s about protecting them. If I report the transactions as not mine, and they can&amp;#8217;t prove it was me, AFAIK, they&amp;#8217;ll get removed off my account, and they take the hit, not me. So I understand why they block the card all the fucking time.  What I do have a problem with is their inability to let me fucking know about it. The card gets a block and it&amp;#8217;s not until I try buy something in a shop and it gets rejected that I know about it.  Sure sure, they have systems to let me know about it. Their systems have included  - Phoning my home phone (they&amp;#8217;re not allowed to call mobiles because it seems the 21st century hasn&amp;#8217;t happened for them yet) listening to my message saying &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t check this machine call my mobile on blah&amp;#8221;, and leaving a message - Sending me a letter - Sending me emails that don&amp;#8217;t arrive.  In fact to rectify the email situation I have to write them a actual paper fucking letter and send it off to them, and they&amp;#8217;ll send me a test email. Which won&amp;#8217;t arrive. You can see the epic fail here can&amp;#8217;t you. I&amp;#8217;ve informed them that it&amp;#8217;s easier for me just to stop using their cards. I have others.  The problem with their blocks on my cards is it really fucks things up when ordering time sensitive things like tickets or birthday presents. And their reply when I&amp;#8217;ve lost out on gig tickets (sold out) or flights have gone up or I&amp;#8217;ve had tio make a ?15 phone call from New York to clear my card whilst looking like giant knob with $2k of snowboard geer or goods over the internet I have paid for express delivery arrive 4 days late because of the block is &amp;#8220;Sorry nothing we can do about it&amp;#8221;  So whilst I&amp;#8217;m not cancelling my cards (they&amp;#8217;re handy to have as backups), I&amp;#8217;m telling them that I&amp;#8217;m going to stop using them and this is why. I mean it&amp;#8217;s not even that Barclaycard integrates into my Barclays accounts, so my incentive to carry on using them is pretty non existent.  Sorry Barclaycard, you&amp;#8217;re dumped.
