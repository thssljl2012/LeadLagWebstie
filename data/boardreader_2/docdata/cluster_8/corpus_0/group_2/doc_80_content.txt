Looks like I may need a new bank in Irvine, preferably one that also has branches in New York. Maybe Wachovia or will they be next to go? I&amp;#8217;d use Bank of America, except my wife already uses them and I&amp;#8217;d rather not put more than one egg in each basket these days. Update: Looks like it may just turn into another Chase branch, and not actually close. I got away from Chase years ago, but for now that would work.  Fortunately, WAMU is not my main account (that&amp;#8217;s still in New York at Amalgamated.) so this is just a minor inconvenience. I am glad I didn&amp;#8217;t deposit the check for my last article yet. Fortuitously, I&amp;#8217;d accidentally written a bunch of checks on my WAMU account instead of my New York account recently. I narrowly avoided bouncing the rent, but it does mean I had relatively little money (less than a $1000 I think) in the account at the moment.
