Has anyone else noticed that the financial world seems to be going nuts at the moment?&amp;nbsp; In my last blog, I gave a call to arms, for everyone to stand and fight for what is rightfully theirs.&amp;nbsp; Tonight, I call everyone in the industry, in ministry, in any walk of life to use wisdom.&amp;nbsp; Pay attention!!&amp;nbsp; Two Major Financial institutions have been bought by one company. &amp;nbsp; Merrill Lynch (one of the biggest and oldest financial and investment institutions) and Countrywide (The BIGGEST subprime housing lender) were bought by Bank of America, who also bouth Lasalle Bank.&amp;nbsp; This is a sign, remember, history repeats itself.&amp;nbsp; The last time this happened, There were two major rushes on the Banks.&amp;nbsp; In 1907, whis caused legislation to be written for the FED ( not the Federal Government, but a central bank) to handle all of the money in the Country.&amp;nbsp; After this legislation was passed, 14 years later, there was another run on the banks when the FED called in all of it's loans and mortgages from all the banks.&amp;nbsp; This second Run Caused the Great Depression in which the stock market crashed and housing was lost, which caused us to move into WWII.&amp;nbsp; My friends, I don't care if you are Hood, Gangsta, Christian, Muslim, Preppie, WHATEVER....Make sure that you are making the right moves with your money.&amp;nbsp; Invest in Silver, Gold, and things that are tangible.&amp;nbsp; Do not waste your money on expensive things that you cannot pay for.&amp;nbsp; The dollar is so weak right now that people across the world are asking to be paid in Euros.&amp;nbsp; I am not saying abandon hope in getting money, but do not be foolish with it.&amp;nbsp; To be truly wealthy in this market is not to have $$$, but to own land, gold, and silver, precious metals.&amp;nbsp; Get a safe and keep your stuff with you.&amp;nbsp; This is wisdom for those who are trying to make it in this game of life.&amp;nbsp; Be smart with your money right now, because that lavish lifestyle you are looking at on TV can be swiped in an instant if you are not paying attention.&amp;nbsp; If you think I am lying, why is gas so high, why has the price of food gotten out of hand?&amp;nbsp; The simple needs are being put out of range for the average person.&amp;nbsp; And it will get worse.&amp;nbsp; Models, Musicians, Singers Rappers, Ministers, Prophets, Black People, White People, WHOEVER....PLEASE TAKE THIS WISDOM I AM GIVING YOU AND USE IT!!&amp;nbsp; Now is the time to stand up, fight, Trust God, And Do what is right.&amp;nbsp; I love all of you with the love of God.&amp;nbsp; If you are feeling me, give me a shout!!!Will                   This Flash Player was created @ FlashWidgetz.com.
