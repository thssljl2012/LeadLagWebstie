 Bank of America has charged me with sneaky hidden fees, specifically, overdraft charges. If you hold a bank account with Bank of America or ANY of its new affiliates, HERE&amp;#8217;S SOME INFO YOU MUST READ! I got shafted and shafted good by B of A recently. I&amp;#8217;ve been with B of A for a couple years now and things were ok until recently. Long story short, I had X amount of funds within B of A. With purchases I made, I was in the overdraft pending stage. Having dealt with this sorta thing before, I quickly placed enough money, so I had some positive balance in the account. I also made sure I had no pending charges from any purchases I may have made in that past month. So I let everything sit there for about 3 days and when I get back to my online banking, BOOM! Some of the same charges are there in the pending stages! WTF!? and its overdrawn with NO OVERDRAFT FEE APPLIED YET! (keyword &amp;#8220;YET&amp;#8221;) So it&amp;#8217;s a few dollars overdrawn and I call a rep and she chit chats with me and goes over some of the &amp;#8220;rules&amp;#8221; that are never easy to find. If you ask me, it should be IN FRONT THE ATM. Important info is located at the side of the machine, when you make a 90 degree turn, OR ON YOUR ONLINE BANKING TRANSACTION PAGE! She ASSURES me that if I place those extra funds in my account, I will be fine. So I am fed up with this shit and decide to cover my poor ass one more time. So I rush again for the 2nd time that week and place some more funds into my account. More after the jump!  (more&amp;#8230;)
