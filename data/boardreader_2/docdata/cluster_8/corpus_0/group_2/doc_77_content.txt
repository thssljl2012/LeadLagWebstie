SO....I HAVE A FEW BANK ACCOUNTS BUT SERIOUSLY....OUT OF THEM ALL....I ABSOLUTELY LOVE PNC BANK! I AM A BIG "DO EVERYTHING ONLINE" PERSON AND I HAD A DIGITAL CHECKING ACCOUNT WITH THEM WHICH WAS GREAT...UNTIL TODAY....I CONVERTED MY ACCOUNTS&amp;nbsp;TO SOME NEW THING THEY HAVE....AND ITS JUST THE BEST THING EVER! www.pncvirtualwallet.com (SIGHS) I JUST LOVE IT! ASIDE THE EASE AND GREATNESS OF THIS PLACE....I SWEAR...OF ALL THE BANKS I HAVE EVER DEALT WITH...THEY ARE THE BEST.  I JUST LOVING GOING&amp;nbsp;INTO ANY BRANCH...EVERYONE IS SO NICE AND EVEN IF THEY ARE HAVING A BAD DAY...THEY STILL SMILE AND HAVE A DECENT CONVO WITH YOU. THEIR ONLINE BANKING HAS ALWAYS&amp;nbsp;BEEN A STEP AHEAD OF&amp;nbsp;ANYTHING I HAVE EVER HAD. COMMERCE, BANK OF AMERICA, ING (I STILL HAVE THEM AND THEY ARE WONDERFUL TOO), SOVERIEGN...EVEN MY OWN CREDIT UNION....PNC'S ONLINE FUNCTIONS/LAYOUT/BILL PAY/INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TRANSFERS....SMASHES ALL OF THEM. THE 800 CUSTOMER SERVICE.....FLAWLESS! I HAVE NOT TALKED TO A PERSON YET WHO HAS A SUPER GHETTO NAME LIKE BONQUISHA OR LE'TRASHAWN (YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN), ANYONE WITH AN OBVIOUS ATTITUDE&amp;nbsp;OR EVEN SOMEONE WHO HAS A 'HEAVY' ACCENT....IT'S WONDERFUL! NEVER CLOSING MY ACCOUNT...EVER!
