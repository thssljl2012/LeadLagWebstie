So last weekend as we were getting ready to drive out to our usual Sunday lunch with the in-laws we got a call from Bank of America reporting some suspicious activity on our account.&amp;nbsp; This isn't the first time I've gotten one of these.&amp;nbsp; I've purchased things online from out-of-state or from another country and the bank has called just to check.&amp;nbsp; I don't mind that.&amp;nbsp; In fact, I really like the fact that my bank is looking out for me.&amp;nbsp;   So I jump online and check my account.&amp;nbsp; Sure enough there are five charges from a company called CCBillEU.com.&amp;nbsp; I say it was five charges, but really is was three charges and two credits.&amp;nbsp; Weird, I know, but I think that's what tripped the banks fraud alert.&amp;nbsp; I've never done business with them and Katie (it said her's was the card used) doesn't use her bank card online.&amp;nbsp; The bank went ahead and canceled her card and voided those transactions.&amp;nbsp; It was a crappy way to start a Sunday but at least we stopped it before anything serious happened.  On Tuesday Katie happened to check her other bank account online.&amp;nbsp; Much to her dismay she found a charge there to the same company, CCBillEU.com.&amp;nbsp; She immediatley called the bank and told them about the charge and about the incident on Sunday.&amp;nbsp; Again, they canceled her checkcard and reversed the charges.&amp;nbsp; Now we start thinking about where the numbers could have been stolen.&amp;nbsp; The cards didn't get lost, so who have we done business with locally that she would have used both cards?&amp;nbsp; Misterious - yes and it gets better.  Since it was fresh on our minds I checked our BoA account again online to make sure Sunday's fraudulant charges had been reversed.&amp;nbsp; I still saw one pending but I assumed that they just had not had the opportunity to process it yet.&amp;nbsp; My mistake.&amp;nbsp; Today the charge cleared and it under my card number.&amp;nbsp; So to recap:&amp;nbsp; someone managed to get the numbers for all of our checkcards from both our banks and used them at the same merchant on Friday and Saturday.  I've looked over all the transactions we've made in the last weeks and the only place all three cards have been used is the Wal-Mart Supercenter in Belton.&amp;nbsp; Do I know for a fact it was someone there?&amp;nbsp; No.&amp;nbsp; But I do know that the only merchant in town that all three of our cards have been used at.&amp;nbsp; Just for good meaure I'm going to call Belton PD tomorrow to make sure no one else has had the same issue.  So a closing thought.&amp;nbsp; If you live close, and you do buisness at the Belton Wal-Mart you might want to keep an eye on your account.&amp;nbsp; If you don't live here, well you might just want to keep an eye out anyway.
