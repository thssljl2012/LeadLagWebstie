I had an old credit card that was set up initially by my mom. Because BoA is an Enormous Giga-Idiot, they never could get it straight who owned the card - my name is on it, I pay the tab, but they kept messing things up. This summer, I closed that card, got another one using just MY credit info, and moved on. I was under the impression that because the BoA rep said "okay, it is closed, and we will send you a statement for the final balance" that it actually was. After calling a couple of times and getting lost in phone hell, I gave up. I figured that they know where I live, and my new card is STILL a Bank of America card, they should be able to send me the final bill. They have everything they need to reach me, and are still getting a monthly bill from me, they should be able to do that much. No. The card was never actually closed, and has been quietly accumulating late fees. So they call me again, asking for my mom. That's right, called ME, on MY NUMBER, asking for someone else. After I'd already wasted part of July fixing all of this once. The guy removed two months of late fees, but still wanted me to pay this month's balance right then to avoid more. I explained that perhaps he was unclear on the issue, and that I needed to speak to someone who could resolve it permanently. I finally told the guy to send me a paper statement, because as far as they are concerned if it happens via phone there is a 50% chance it "didn't happen", and that I would pay the balance in full only when I get some actual paper saying how much it is. I'm through with phone reps. They are a huge collective Dumbass. Giga-idiots.
