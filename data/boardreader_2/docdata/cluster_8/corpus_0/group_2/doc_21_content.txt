This morning on NPR I heard a Republican Congressman talk about how we've been "treating the symptoms" of the current financial crisis instead of "attacking the source of the disease."&amp;nbsp; He went on to explain that the source are the mortgage backed securities that are now toxic because of the high rate of default now. I wanted to punch the guy in the head.The banks and insurance companies (AIG, I'm looking at you) are to blame for this.&amp;nbsp; The lenders gave complicated mortgages to people who could not afford them, assuming that their home values would go up and the borrowers could refinance when they entered the variable rate period of their loan, or when the borrower realized they were going to be making house payments forever because they were not paying off any capital in their interest-only loan.&amp;nbsp;  Similarly, when AIG was asked to underwrite these loans, they thought they were getting the deal of the century because they'd be raking in premiums on safe mortages.&amp;nbsp; And of course, since we have no real regulation and these credit default swaps are not legal securities, AIG had no capital reserve to buffer the effect of their catastropic loss, so the taxpayers had to bail them out. But who is bailing out the family that is facing forclosure?The REAL cause of this crisis is forclosures.&amp;nbsp; If people could afford to stay in their homes, then there would be no defaulting, the lenders would be happy, and AIG wouldn't lose their ass paying for their stupid, stupid underwriting. So as the Congressman said, let's address the source of the disease:First - anyone in an adjustable rate mortage gets an automatic and no-cost refinance to a 30-year fixed at the adjustable rate they originally had.&amp;nbsp; Rates can be discounted up to 2 points for families that this annual payment would be more than 25% of their annual income.&amp;nbsp; If you had an interest only loan, you'd get a set rate based on the average ARM rate at the time of your loan, with the same need-based discount as above. Second - anyone who has forclosed on their homes since January 1, 2008 has the same offer on the table.&amp;nbsp; They can purchase a new home a set rate based on the average ARM rate at the time of your loan, with the same need-based discount as above.&amp;nbsp; This not only would help those people would couldn't hang on long enough for help to arrive, but it also would stimulate the housing market. Third - any banks who participate with the rules above will get operational bridge loans.&amp;nbsp; The strings on these loans include a cap of $175,000/yr on executive pay, no dividend payments to bank shareholders, and equal value equity in the bank as collateral.&amp;nbsp; The rate will be reasonable and in line with LIBOR.&amp;nbsp; It wilL NOT include a tax holiday on capital gains. Fourth - this plan would be contingent with enhanced, common-sense regulation on lending and securities.&amp;nbsp; Anyone who says that we can't do that without screwing the economy should look out the window and the stuff going on right now, because that's what happens when you don't have regulation.&amp;nbsp; I'd rathat have a stable, non-optimal market than the bleeding wreck we have now. If you have any thoughts, let me know.&amp;nbsp; Otheriwse, I'll wait for Paulson and Bernake to give me a call.
