Still sucks. Not as hard today as somedays, but good grief.Took me three calls to get my mortgage payment adjusted today.First call took me through the phone tree until the automated man said "I'll transfer you to a customer service representative." pause "We can no longer process your call, please hang up."WHAT? what kind of freaking message is that?So I call the local bank, and ask for the correct number to call, since that one apparently was the fail. Nobody at the bank, of course, can adjust things-that has to be done by someone in some call center somewhere else.So I call the correct number (not even close to the number listed in the phone book), and wade through the phone tree again, and get a woman who (I hope) has managed to do what I asked, but only after I had phrased the same request 3 different ways, since she didn't seem to get it the first two times. Sigh.Now we'll see if they actually take the correct amount next month.
