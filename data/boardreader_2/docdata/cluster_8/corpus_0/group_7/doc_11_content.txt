Although the jets have yet to appear on Craigslist or eBay, rumor has it that Bank of America Corp. is putting three of its seven corporate jets up for sale after President Obama's executive compensation cap was announced Wednesday morning. Unlike many of us, CEO Ken Lewis does not fly coach and can't even opt for first class because he is contractually required (no joke!) to use company aircraft for personal trips, leading him to ring up a bill of  $127,643 in 2007, according to a March 2008 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. By selling three jets, Bank of America should be saving a lot of money (a cross-country trip in a midsized jet costs about $20,000 for fuel). Since BofA never used three of the planes, it should get a pretty penny for them (well, a pretty penny in this economy is probably worth less than when the planes were actually purchased, but anyway). Bank of America is also trying to sell off a helicopter it inherited via the Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. merger and one of two apartments it owns in New York City's Time Warner Center.Now it's not known which apartments the bank will be selling, but according to CityRealty these are the asking prices of apartments at 80 Columbus Circle: 4 Bedrooms from $14,000,000 (updated 04/16/2008)3 Bedrooms from $8,450,000 to $20,750,000 (updated 12/11/2008)2 Bedrooms from $5,600,000 to $12,600,000 (updated 01/30/2009)1 Bedroom from $3,956,500 to $7,250,000 (updated 04/19/2008)- Maria Woehr
