Saw the news about AIG paying bonus to their executives and traders. My 1streactionwas &#8220;Huh?&#8221; After all the speculations and the fact that they are going down&#8230; they are still paying bonuses to their executives and traders?! I cant help but wonder why did they come up with this decision. Their company is in distress and ppl are getting retrenched overnight.. why are they still paying bonus to traders esp.. after all the massive damage.It is like paying at an unappropriate time. Obama has a right to be angry about it.. http://sg.news.yahoo.com/afp/20090317/tts-us-politics-insurance-public-aid-aig-972e412.html
