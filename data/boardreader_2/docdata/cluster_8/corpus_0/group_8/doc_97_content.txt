 Moody's, the bond and credit rating service, has gone negative on JPMorgan Chase.   JPM Chase holds $91.3 TRILLION in derivatives. That&#8217;s 40.6 times its total assets. These include $9.2 TRILLION credit default swaps. Credit default swaps might as well be written on gasoline-soaked flash-paper and handed to kids playing with matches. There is very little hope these swaps are worth anything. Which means that JPM Chase is actually already bankrupt since the company only has $2 TRILLION is assets  $91.3 TRILLION is over $15,000 for every man, woman, and child on Earth! Yes, even those little African kids with the distended bellies and a halo of flies.  Wells Fargo got downgraded, too, because it is out of capital. Over extended!  Citicorp ended the day @ $1.02 a share down from its high of $57. Over extended!  Bank of America @ $3.17 is less than 10% of its value on this day last year! Over extended!  Down Jones off 281.40 today.  Obama is the worst president in history already. Obama fans convince me I'm wrong!  Stand up, plant your garden. Practice with that firearm you bought. Get on your knees and pray.
