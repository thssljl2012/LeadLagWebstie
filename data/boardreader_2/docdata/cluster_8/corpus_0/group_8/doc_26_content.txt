AIG was an insurance company. A big part of its business was selling CDSs, which obligated the company to pay out in a huge way in the event of a catastrophic, unforeseen wave of defaults. Then there was a catastrophic, unforeseen wave of defaults, and AIG didn't have enough money to honor its obligations. So the government took it over and you and I are now paying off those debts. But to whom?   Last night on the Newshour, Joe Nocera said:You know, there's a saying now you hear on Wall Street, which is that it's not a bailout of AIG. It`s a bailout of the counterparties. Now, who are these counterparties? In fact, we don't know precisely, because the government won't tell us. And AIG views this information as a trade secret.  But if AIG is now, for all intents and purposes, a government entity, can't that information be FOIA-ed? Somebody's surely thought of this and has an answer, and I'd like to know what it is.
