Ken Lewis, the CEO of Bank of America (which you the taxpayer is the single biggest shareholder) effectively confirms to Businessweek that the $45 billion his company got came with absolutely no strings attached: MARIA BARTIROMO: Your company has received $45 billion in taxpayer money. Will you be able to operate the bank the way you want to operate it with the government owning a stake and questioning some of your decisions? KEN LEWIS: I don't think it will fundamentally change the way we run the company. Read that again: We gave that bank $45 billion as its business practices helped destroy the economy. And yet, it's CEO is telling us that money doesn't mean any fundamental change to the way that company does business. Because, really, why would we want banks that destroyed the economy to change their business practices, right?
