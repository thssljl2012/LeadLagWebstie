 Last year the government gave AIG $150 BILLION in bailout funds to rescue the giant insurance corporation from imploding. Today AIG posted the biggest quarterly loss in U.S. history: $61.7 BILLION. In a matter of weeks, AIG will receive another $30 BILLION in bailout loans from the government. I call bullshit. Enough with rescuing these giant corporations! AIG is considered &#8220;too big to let fail.&#8221; Why? Their greed got the best of them. Better luck next time, schmucks. Obama should be putting a stop to this, but he&#8217;s not. He&#8217;s following in Bush&#8217;s footsteps with AIG. If the company is failing it&#8217;s their own fault! The government could have instead given every adult in the United States an $800 tax cut (or rebate)! Or they could have thrown the money at our public schools, which desperately need updated in order to assure we can compete on a global economy in business, science, and technology. There are a dozen other entities that could have used that money much more than AIG, and they are still in a downward spiral. When will Obama realize that enough is enough before WE end up with all their bad debt? [Source]
