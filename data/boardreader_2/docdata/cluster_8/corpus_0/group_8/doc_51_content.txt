by Peter Nicholas  President Obama is letting it be known that, yes, he's awfully upset about the bonuses paid to employees of AIG, the insurance giant that received a federal bailout.  U.S. Sen. Kent Conrad (D-ND) met privately with the president Tuesday morning to talk about the budget. As the two men walked from an elevator to a meeting room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Obama made clear he was "irritated'' about the bonuses, said Conrad, who chairs the Budget Committee.  "He is angered,'' Conrad said in an interview. "Just visibly angered by what has occurred. He is somebody who is a very calm person. But you could tell this has irritated him, really irritated him.''  "And I think he was struggling to understand how people could be so out of touch.''  Obama's flash of annoyance came as Republicans are criticizing the White House over the bonuses. House minority leader John Boehner (R-Oh) said at a news conference Tuesday: ""Two weeks ago, the president's spokesman said that they were confident that they knew how every dime was being spent at AIG.  Well clearly, they didn't know what they were talking about.''
