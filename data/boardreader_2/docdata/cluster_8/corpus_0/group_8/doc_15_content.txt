I&#8217;m not sure if I had ever heard of AIG before last fall. When I was getting ready to go to Wales, I decided to get my travel insurance from TravelGuard, which was an AIG company. I bought my insurance, and needed it - I had some difficulty getting to my destination, and the insurance covered all of the extra expenses. (If you&#8217;re planning an overseas trip, make SURE that you get travel insurance.) I got home about the same time that AIG got its first bailout. My first thought was, &#8220;What&#8217;s going to happen to my insurance coverage?&#8221; But nothing happened; I filed my claim, and got my money back very quickly. I thought about this on Tuesday, when I saw the new AIG chairman/CEO on the Today show. He said that the bailouts that AIG continues to receive are meant to protect the holders of AIG insurance policies - like me. They not only sell travel insurance, but homeowner&#8217;s, car, and other kinds. That side of their business is strong, and they&#8217;re trying to keep it from being adversely affected by the other side (the toxic securities side) of their business. That makes sense. I&#8217;m not thrilled (that&#8217;s a definite understatement) that we&#8217;re bailing out all these companies with taxpayer money. We are never going to get out of debt. But if a little of the bailout can protect people who haven&#8217;t made any financial mistakes from those who have, then that little bit might be worth it.
