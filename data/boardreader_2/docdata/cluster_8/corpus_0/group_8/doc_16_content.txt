From Scott Ott at the dcexaminer: The Treasury Department announced today that the bail out [sic] of AIG Insurance, which began in September under the Bush administration, is working better than expected. Encouraged by the company&#8217;s loss of nearly $62 billion in the 4th quarter of 2008, the Obama administration injected another $30 billion into AIG this week. &#8220;The government stepped in last year with $150 billion because AIG was too big to fail,&#8221; said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. &#8220;The stock was trading in early September at more than $20 per share. Today it&#8217;s worth less than 50 cents a share. If we keep pumping billions of tax dollars into it, I&#8217;d say we&#8217;ll soon reach the point where AIG won&#8217;t be too big to fail, and then we can stop giving them money.&#8221; Posted in Current events, economy, government, News Tagged: AIG, bailout, economy
