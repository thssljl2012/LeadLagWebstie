Preparing for today&#8217;s Founding Father&#8217;s Quote Friday I must admitI&#8217;ve beentorn. I&#8217;ve been re-reading Original Meanings by Jack N. Rakove simply because it is one of those books written so superbly that it has left a profound impression in my mind. And as usual then came the morning news along with the collection of news articles updated in my &#8216;Reader&#8217; concerning the activities in Washington D.C. Therefore,a lotof what&#8217;sbeen written for today is a paraphrased version of Rakove&#8217;s book to assist in the conception of what the founding fathers were trying to forge. Known for his characteristic fondness for drawing distinctions, Madison traced the sources of unjust legislation to both (1) &#8220;the Representative bodies&#8221; and (2) &#8220;the people themselves.&#8221; Accordingly Madison asserted that legislative office was sought for three reasons: &#8220;ambition,&#8221; &#8220;personal interest,&#8221; and a regard for &#8220;public good.&#8221; Madison&#8217;s experience proved that the first two predominated, with disastrous results. Artful legislators &#8220;with interested views&#8221; could always find ways to sacrifice &#8220;the interest, and views of the Constituents&#8221; for their own purposes, and then to have their &#8220;base and selfish measures, masked by pretexts of public good and apparent expediency.&#8221; Madison warned that even &#8220;honest&#8221; representatives would often fall prey to &#8220;a favorite leader, veiling his selfish views under the professions of public good, and varnishing his sophistical arguments with the glowing colours of popular eloquence.&#8221; Madison in a few sentences, whilst drawing on his own bitter lessons gained from experience in the Virginia assembly and his almost preoccupation with monitoring of the other states, now understood better that legislative misrule was itself often only a symptom of problems rooted in the larger society. &#8220;A still more fatal if not more frequent cause&#8221; of injustice, he wrote, &#8220;lies among the people themselves.&#8221; While orthodox republican theory recognized that the people were often prone to unhealthy enthusiasms, it expected them to resist arbitrary acts of government corrosives of their own liberty. Ultimately it was the civic virtue of the people that would have to prevent republican government from degenerating into a &#8216;mobocracy.&#8217; Today, Senate Republicans are flexing what little muscle they have left, even making the Obama administration squirm, applying the brakes to Democratic attempts to quickly tax away most of the bonuses at troubled insurance giant AIG and other bailed-out companies. With the astuteness of Sen. John Kyl, the Republicans&#8217; vote counter, blocked Democratic efforts Thursday evening to bring up the Senate version of the tax bill to recoup most of the $165 million paid out by AIG last weekend and other bonuses in 2009. The House had swiftly approved its version of the bill earlier in the day.We are asking one very simple question that in this mess of a bailout would seem rather obvious to everyone: What is the hurry?
