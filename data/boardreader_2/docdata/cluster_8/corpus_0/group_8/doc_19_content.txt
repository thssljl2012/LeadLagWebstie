Rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic was child&#8217;s play compared to Edward Liddy&#8217;s song and dance to try to keep insurance giant AIG afloat. As we recall, the Titanic was &#8220;too big to fail,&#8221; too.       AIG, which still manages to sponsor a famous soccer team, is failing because they offered &#8220;insurance&#8221; against losses on mortgage-backed securities to financial firms throughout the world. The losses, which were not supposed to be possible, have come to pass.  AIG sold this &#8220;insurance&#8221; for a lower price than would have been possible if the risk had been realistically evaluated and reserved. They didn&#8217;t just underprice the risk, they kept no reserves on hand whatsoeverto deal with potential losses. One unit of AIG took out the equivalent of a big signature loan to sell worthless paper to the financial world. The only value backing this phantom insurance is the (now devalued) assets of AIG&#8217;s other lines of business, which will have to be sold. In any other context, this would be called what it is: fraud.  Several times a year, Insurance Commissioners around the country prosecute people who sell insurance with no intention of paying claims. People who bought stock in these companies lose their investments. Policyholders are paid from state guarantee funds if they have legitimate claims. People who were suckered by low premiums find out it was indeed too good to be true. To listen to Edward Liddy (above), you would think teachers risk losing their retirement annuities if AIG goes bankrupt. Common folk will lose their auto insurance! Wrong. The bankruptcy courts and guarantee funds have very well-established procedures to protect the teacher&#8217;s pensions and legitimate insurance products if AIG is liquidated in bankruptcy.  The unprotected are the financial giants who bought the fake insurance that Phil Gramm, John McCain and George W. Bush made sure was unregulated. So why has AIG received $150 billion of federal money? Why are they going to get $30 billion more after losing $61 billion, more than Bill Gates is worth, in the 4th quarter? To save the bankers who bought this unregulated insurance from themselves, and the rest of us from the catastrophic consequences of AIG&#8217;s worldwide Ponzi scheme. See, if the Ponzi scheme is big enough, thebonuses and big parties can continue. And no one goes to jail.  Opponents of a modest housing bailout are uneasy about rewarding &#8220;bad&#8221; behavior by those who bought homes they could barely afford? Shame on them. AIG makes Bernie Madoff look like Martha Stewart. but don&#8217;t those deck chairs look nice?  Arrrrrrrrrgh!
