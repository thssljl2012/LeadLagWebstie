Here in Chicago, workers of a failed company are occupying its plant, demanding severance pay and vacation time.The company was in trouble, lost its financing from Bank of America, and closed its doors on short notice.Barack Obama, Jesse Jackson, the governor of Illinois, and our remaining U.S. senator have all voiced their support for these workers. Our governor is demanding that Bank of America reopen its tax-dollar suffused credit line for the company.&amp;nbsp;But... it's a window and door company. And construction in the U.S. has hit the brakes, with no green light in sight. Does this place sound like a good loan prospect?Rep. Luis Gutierrez, who also has been making appearances at the sit-in, said the workers under federal law are entitled to 60 days' pay in the event of a shutdown.Of course, that 60 days of pay is supposed to come from the company. But if the company doesn't have any money...I see a flawin that law -when a company's truly in hock,you can't squeeze blood from a rock.
