We have our monthly cash flow set up 'just so'.  Certain things are due mid-month, certain things are due end of month.  Getting a nice distribution throughout the month is crucial to being able to manage cash flow well.When I started using Citicard for the Cash Reward, the due date was always a few days shy of the pay period I wanted targeted for credit card payoff.So I called Citicard asking if they could push back the billing cycle a few days, thus pushing back due date to the 'other side' of the pay period I was striving for.'No problem'.  Piece of cake.The backup credit card, Bank of America, has given me more grief in doing this.I have had to call several times to get this done, but finally, Gaw, after many months, I called again today, and got past the 'Customer Service' frontline to a Credit Analyst who said "I don't know why this has been such a problem, it's a very easy thing to do."To which I took a deep breath, thanked her for getting this done, and went on my merry way.So, my point is, if you have a credit card due date that keeps hitting shy of the pay period you want to pay it with, just make a phone call to your credit card company and ask for a different billing cycle.
