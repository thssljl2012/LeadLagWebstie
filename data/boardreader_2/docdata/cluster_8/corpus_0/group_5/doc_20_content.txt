Let me see if I follow the chronology correctly here.  1.  Bank of America pulls credit lines from Republic Window &amp; Doors, presumably there are profitability reasons attached.  Republic Window &amp; Doors is in what might broadly be called the "real estate" market, even the "new construction market" which isn't exactly a massive cash cow at the moment.  2.  Republic Window &amp; Doors, seeking to avoid bankruptcy, lays off most of its employees.  In doing so they run afoul of state rules requiring 60 days notice, etc.  3.  Republic employees stage a sit in.  4.  Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich suggests to Illinois agencies that doing business with Bank of America is a bad idea, on the rationale that since B of A got bailout money, whats the harm in lending to the likes of Republic Window &amp; Door?  So, the price of accepting bailout funds has become the wholesale replacement of traditional credit criteria with political influence criteria when making lending decisions.  I am reminded of Japan.  Anyone else?  Given the state of Illinois finances, further, I wonder if Rod isn't doing B of A a favor.  Illinois Governor Suspends Business With Bank Of America [The Huffington Post]
