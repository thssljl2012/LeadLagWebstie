&amp;nbsp; When I opened an account with Bank of America, I started having problems with them 6 months later. They never told me that every month, they withdraw 25 dollars from your checking to savings. I had a feeling&amp;nbsp;they do that on purpose, so a person can overdraft and pay a fine&amp;nbsp;and it happened twice. DAMMIT~!!! And&amp;nbsp;they're stupid&amp;nbsp;corperate companies started charging me for some &amp;nbsp;insurance I never agreed to. I kept saying no, I am not interested and they messed me up.I lost money becuase of them.They also called my house every other day bugging me. I had to close my account because of them, thanks a lot~!! Then, I opened an account with WaMu (Washington Mutual). It was a better bank than Bank of America. The only thing that I hated was the withdrawing of 5 bucks from checking to savings. Since now, the bank has failed and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;that it belongs to Chase Bank, I had a funny feeling about my account&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp; known people who had problems with Chase Bank, so I&amp;nbsp; decided to close my account. I now have my parents bank, Bank of The West. Atleast they don't do that shit of withdrawing money from checking to savings every month. I just hope that I have no problems with this one. I am not in the mood of switching banks.
