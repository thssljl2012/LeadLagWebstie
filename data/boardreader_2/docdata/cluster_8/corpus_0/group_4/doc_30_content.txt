It's only taken me three years, but I've finally accumulated 25,000 points on my Bank of America ASU Alumni Platinum Plus Credit Card, which can be redeemed for round trip coach-class&amp;nbsp;air travel within the 48 contiguous United States.&amp;nbsp;The big&amp;nbsp;question is - where do I go? Now&amp;nbsp;it's time to&amp;nbsp;retire the card. I'll REALLY&amp;nbsp;miss it's obnoxious gold color and in-your-face Sparky attitude.&amp;nbsp;It's the only card in my wallet with character!&amp;nbsp;I applied for it back in the day before I knew about 5% cash back and rewards credit cards, and it definitely has a lower&amp;nbsp;conversion rate than&amp;nbsp;other cards in my arsenal.
