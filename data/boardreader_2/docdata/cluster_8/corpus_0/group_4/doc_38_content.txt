Big credit card issuersincluding Chase, Bank of America, Discoverand Citibank banded together with consumer groupspleading for mercy from the Treasury Department. The regulators have spoken andlikethe cashier at a Palm Beach Publix when Ann Coulter attempted a credit card purchase back in February, the answer isDENIED! Abouttwo weeks ago, a request was submitted to the Treasury Department by the Financial Services Roundtable (representative ofthe banks, etc.) and the Consumer Federation of America.Last night, news broke that the request was rejected. According to AP reports,the proposal allowed credit cardcompanies toforgive of up to 40 percent of debt per person. Each credit card holder coulddelay payment of income taxesowed on their forgivendebt until after the remainder of the debt was paid off. The credit card companies would wait until the remaining debt was paid offto book their losses on the forgiven portion. I can see how lowering balances andlengthening repayment termswould helpborrowers (look at the government and AIG). I can also see how this would help debtors. The delayed recognition of losses can make a company look more profitable than it actually is. Thiscanmake a companylook more attractive to investors and lead to a higher stock price. So again, we have banks coming together to aid the consumer and again, we know that they want to aid their bottom lines as well. FYI: just like mortgages were used to back bonds so too arecredit card receivables. If the receivables are not received then we are in for more write-offs, write-downs and losses. :( Tags: ann coulter, chase, consumer federation of america, credit card, discover, treasury departmentShare This
