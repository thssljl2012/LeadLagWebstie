What do I know about kredit cards?  Oops, sorry, its credit cards!  In the Malay language, the word is spelt as kredit.  Anyway, back to the question.  Actually, I dont think Ill own a credit card for now as Im still a student with not much earnings to spend!  My parents used to have credit cards too but they stopped using them probably because they dont do much shopping anymore!Nowadays and usually at the mall, therell be people trying to get mall rats to sign up for credit cards.  Theyll ask me if I pass them and Ill say sorry but Im only still a student.  At least I dont have to stand and listen to all their promoting!However, with a credit card, you can shop online easily.  Online shops usually accept Visa, Mastercard, Amex Corporate Credit Cards, Bank of America Credit Cards and so on.  I usually make payments via Paypal or bank deposit.  If you do own a credit card, remember to spend wisely though.
