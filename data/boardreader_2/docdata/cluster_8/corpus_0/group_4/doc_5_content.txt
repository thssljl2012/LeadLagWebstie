Last saturday I had a knock at the door. I thought it might be the annoying grass man that will not stop coming by but I was wrong. It was a man in a button up shirt and a cowboy hat. Yeah, I know I am from Texas but really! He asked if I were D'Ann Hedges, (here it comes), "you have been served". So he signs some papers and hands it to me.   I am to send a "written answer" to the court. I am being sued for an old credit card debit! Before you jump all over me about it, I did pay for the credit card. But at one point I got late. It DOES happen! I then found my bill went up over $200 in late fees. I spoke to them, Bank Of America several times. They called me and I called them. But they would not give in ..ing me by forgiving the late fees. I could NOT pay that payment. So, that is how it went. Now I find out that they sold my account to Hilco and they in turn sold the account to another creditor. All this time they are tacking on additional fees and interest at 24%!   So here we are, 3 years later. The original account was for $4000. They want over $8000. If you add on the attorney's fees etc it comes to $9,800!   I know I can't pay that. So now, since I cannot afford and attorney, I will have to defend my self in court. I will be found guilty and I will have a judgement against me. That means they can file with the court to put a lien on my property, garnish my wages, freeze my accounts. Great, when it rains it pours and at this point I feel like I am drowning.    Don't get a credit card. They are not a golden ticket. You can't ignore it if you get behind. And if you get behind NO ONE WILL HELP YOU or give a shit for that matter!
