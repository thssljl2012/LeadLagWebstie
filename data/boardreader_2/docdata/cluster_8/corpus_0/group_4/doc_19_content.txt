I am so done with this bank... when I go to work on tuesday I will be terminating my account with them.1.    When they make a mistake they don't want to fix the problem2.    If you have forgotten your identification and you are there regularly.... they claim they don't know you3.    They put a week hold on your pay check leaving you with nothing4.    When you take money from your check and deposit the rest.... they claim you have a negative balance till their week long hold on your check is up... thus causing you to over draft.... then claim its not their fault5.    Because they put a hold on my check I couldn't go out for my birthday.This is not bank of america... this is bank of a communist.   For this they are absolutely finished... and in protest I am asking that if you have an account with them please close it... they do not have you in best interest... and if you are considering it do not open an account with them.
