how many jobs did we salvage in the finance and insurance industries with the bailout of AIG and other Wall Street firms?and why was that OK and salvaging the auto industry isnt?  why are the jobs of people who actually produce something and add real value to the economy not as valuable as the jobs of people who dont produce anything, dont create any real economic value, and lose other peoples money on bets bound to fail, i.e. the banking and finance industry? - Somebody named Suzy Salib commenting in a piece in todays Times about how many jobs will be lost if GM doesnt receive a government bailout. While I generally dont read the comments in the NY Times (theyre a small step above the crackpot-ery found on the Craigslist political forums), this struck a chord. And while people may be disputing exactly how many jobs will be lost should the bailout fail to materialize, the fact remains that its going to be very high. And thats very scary.
