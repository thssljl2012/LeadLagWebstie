via Dear Bank of America   chrisbrogan.com Read Chris&amp;#8217;s post first and then&amp;#8230; I discovered the same policy after my son informed me they wanted to charge him to cash his paycheck. It was written from the account of a local Nashville business that had been around for decades. My son had a checking account at a small community bank and we had just moved back into Nashville. He had choices..leave his account where it was and drive a few extra minutes or open an account closer to home. What _was not_ an option was a BofA account. Their crappy policy , designed as they put it to encourage people to open checking accounts at BofA had just the opposite effectgood plan guys!. He chose Avenue Bank here in Nashville and it was a perfect choice but it made me think hey , what about the others? How many minimum wage employees get charged weekly? What policies do they have in place for low income families? And since this particular branch was on the same corner as a bus stop, were they willing to consider that not every person owns a car and has the luxury of driving to a different bank? BofA was not able to offer anything in the way of policies and I am not able to suggest anyone do business with them. I learned to ask more from my bankbeyond the policies that apply to me.to learn what they do for _everybody_
