When I finally got a chance to look through the mail yesterday afternoon, I became quite angry, to say the very least.The bank cancelled my credit card. WTH?!?!The letter said After careful review of your Bank of America account, we have decided to close your account to further charges. At this time, we will not authorize any further charges, cash advances or overdraft protection on your account because you have a pattern of late payments on accounts with other creditors."Sure, I've been late with my payment a couple times--hasn't everyone?--but not every time. What The Hell! The damn thing only has a $500 limit, anyway, for pity's sake. *shakes head*
