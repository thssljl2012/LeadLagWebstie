Obama Officials Tells Citibank To Ditch Plans For $50 Million Private Jethttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/27/obama-officials-tells-cit_n_161202.htmlOn Monday, the news broke that Citibank was going to use its windfall of $45 billion of our taxpayer $ to go ahead and buy a $50 million private jet they'd had their eye on.According to ABC News, President Obama didn't see that as responsible use of the money.  He had his people call their people and told them to "fix it." I suspect they disagree with his priorities, but they did appreciate the force of his position and have decided to stick with their current fleet of luxury planes.  Poor babies...GOBAMA!
