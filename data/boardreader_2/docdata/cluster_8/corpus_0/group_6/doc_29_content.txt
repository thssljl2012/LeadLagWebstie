My credit card payments are currently coming from my Bank of America checking account  certainly not an interest-producing machine there, by any means.  So I have never really bothered with WHEN I paid my bills.  I usually pay them at the end of the month when I do my usual scrub or whenever I think of it.  But I realize that I AM relinquishing interest, no matter how miniscule, and it wont cause me any grief to just schedule the payments the day before due.  So that is my new commitment to me  paying my credit cards at the very last minute.
