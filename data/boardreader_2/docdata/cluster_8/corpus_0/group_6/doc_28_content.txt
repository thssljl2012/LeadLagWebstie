I opened up a savings account at a separate bank. I had to deposit at least $100 in order to start one. I opted not to get a bank card because I didn't want to be tempted to withdraw needlessly. I don't want to touch this money, I don't even want to see it. I already have a checking account and a savings account at Bank of America. I use the savings account there in order to put money away so I don't spend it before paying my bills. I opened the new one at Suntrust because they don't have maintenance fees (BoA goes crazy with their damn fees) and I won't be so tempted to get the money because it's not connected with anything else right now. I can just deposit it and pretend like I spent it. This is meant to be my emergency fund, nothing more. That's the plan, at least.
