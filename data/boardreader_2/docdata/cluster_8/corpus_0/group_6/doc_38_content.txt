Looks like Citibank got caught in some bad symbolism by accepting delivery of a $50mm Dessault Falcon 7. If you want to read the story along with the obligatory comments by Congress, go here. Hmmmm&#8230;that&#8217;s a damn nice jet. A couple of things: You take government handouts, you have to listen to the government, even though NO ONE from government will give up their use of private jets.  Is Pelosi giving up her use of government jets?  No?  Oh that&#8217;s right, she&#8217;s a Democrat!  How silly of me.  I would guess 0bama isn&#8217;t giving up Air ForceI anytime soon, either. I agree the &#8220;symbolism&#8221; looks bad but making Citi give up the jet won&#8217;t do ONE DAMN THING to help Citi, the economy or anything else.   Actually, the biggest mistake Citi execs made was that they paid their taxes.
