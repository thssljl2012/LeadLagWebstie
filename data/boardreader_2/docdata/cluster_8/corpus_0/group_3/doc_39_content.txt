I wrote the following in response to a friend whom I love to banter politics with (he's entrenched on the left as much as I'm entrenched on the right).&amp;nbsp; He asked me what I thought about the bail out, and here's my reply: I don't agree with it.&amp;nbsp; I don't think there should be a bail out.&amp;nbsp; Frankly, the media and the candidates (especially Obama with his Depression statements) are just fear mongering.&amp;nbsp; The more I dig into what's going on and how we got here the less I think it's that huge of a crisis. Although I'm getting tired of the "8 years of Bush policy" rhetoric that the left and the media keep spewing saying that is the cause for the situation we're in.&amp;nbsp; Don't get me wrong, both sides are to blame for this, and Bush has a hand in it as well with his call for making home buying easier post 9/11 with encouragement for no money down loans and such.&amp;nbsp; The left and the right hands both have blood on them.&amp;nbsp; Although the left has the knife. See, back during the Carter administration, they crafted a bill called the Community Reinvestment Act.&amp;nbsp; It was intended to make it easier to get a home loan.&amp;nbsp; All well and good since you still had prove your credit worthiness and ability to repay the loan. Then in 1992 the Boston Fed released a study showing that black man with 10 million in assets couldn't get a $60,000 loan as compared to a white man.&amp;nbsp; The study was later corrected and it was stated there was a typo and the black man had $1,000 in assets.&amp;nbsp; However, the Fed and the left had moved into action and was sounding the alarms about discrimination in lending and pointing to that study, even though it had been corrected.&amp;nbsp; (would you lend 60,000 to someone with 1,000 in assets regardless of skin color?) In 1995 the CRA was updated to lower the standards even further because of this saying "discrimination may be observed when a lender's underwriting policies contain arbitrary or outdated criteria that effectively disqualify many urban or lower-income minority applicants." What are ouitdated lending practices?&amp;nbsp; They came to include: credit history, income verification, valid identification, etc.&amp;nbsp; In other words, everything you normally needed to get a loan.&amp;nbsp; The Justice Department, under Janet Reno, made it very clear that lenders not giving out loans would be interfered with. So now you had banks being told to lower their standards, groups like ACORN (with the help of Barack Obama as a lawyer working for them) brought class action suits against banks and Fannie Mae to lower their standards so people with bad credit ratings could get home loans.&amp;nbsp; So is it no wonder that so many bad loans were made?&amp;nbsp; Fannie and Freddie helped by creatign more mortgage products to support these crap loans that they are being threatened to make.&amp;nbsp; The banks didn't worry about it much becaue they could turn around and sell these loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, who would then package them as MBS's and sell them to Investment Banks who bought them because they believed that they were guaranteed by the government (since Fannie/Freddie are government owned businesses). Post 9/11 Bush called for making it easier to get into a home by making more mortgage products like no down payment loans, reverse loans, etc.&amp;nbsp; The housing market began to grow with all these crap loans that could be purchased as well as the constant lowering of the Fed rate durting Greenspan's tenure in the Fed which made getting loans easy.&amp;nbsp; (When the interest rate is low, banks can't give away loans fast enough... I never quite understood the mechanism of it, but when interest rates are low it's actually bad economics for banks to sit on the money and not loan it)&amp;nbsp; This brought the speculators into the market who began buying multiple homes tryign to flip them.&amp;nbsp; They typically got sold to other speculators.&amp;nbsp; They became the 90's/2000's version of junk bonds.&amp;nbsp; You had people getting into speculation who were average joes who had no business getting into it.&amp;nbsp; You had people who couldn't afford a loan gettiong loans or getting loans bigger than they could afford.&amp;nbsp; Just as the tech bubble formed in the 90's, the housing bubble formed in the 00's.&amp;nbsp; And just like the 90's people thought it would never end, and at worst would just level out.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately the market was overvalued. Now the market dried up.&amp;nbsp; The savvy speculators knew to stop buying.&amp;nbsp; That left the stupid speculators stuck with up to 4 or 5 homes they couldn't move on their 0-down high interest rate loans they had to suddenly cover.&amp;nbsp; The answer?&amp;nbsp; They defaulted.&amp;nbsp; Interest rates started going back up.&amp;nbsp; People who had bigger loans than they could afford that bought 5 years or more ago with bad credit that were put into Adjustable Rate Mortgages because they couldn't get a fixed rate loan had their rates go up.&amp;nbsp; They defaulted.&amp;nbsp; People who were given loans that couldn't afford them in the first place defaulted.&amp;nbsp; Suddenly all these mortgages were goign belly up.&amp;nbsp; The MBS's created form them lost their value.&amp;nbsp; Banks lost their liquidity.&amp;nbsp; And now we're where we are at. The sad thing is... many people have known this was coming.&amp;nbsp; Both Clinton and Bush had tried to push for reforming Fannie/Freddie about a dozen times between them but the Congress always shot it down.&amp;nbsp; That's because those two organizations have been a piggy bank for legislaters on both sides.&amp;nbsp; In 2004 a report by the regulatory group assigned for oversight on Fannie Mae brought a report forward showing graft and corruption within the company, most notably by Franklin Ranes (former Clinton cabinet member and Obama financil adviosor), Jim Johnson (Obama financial advisor) and Jamie Goerlick (another Clinton cabinet member) who cooked the books to get themselves hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions in bonuses by making it look like they met sales goals.&amp;nbsp; Since 1989 Chris Dodd, Barack Obama, and John Kerry are the top 3 recipients of money from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's PACs and employees.&amp;nbsp; There are republicans that have gained as well, but they are fewer in number than the Democrats that have received money from them.&amp;nbsp;  It's because of this that no one in congress would reform them when calls for it came.&amp;nbsp; In 2004 during statements made to the Banking COmmission headed by the Demcrats, the regulator was shot down by Maxine Waters, Barney Frank, et al., saying that Fannie and Freddie were fine, they were workjign as intended and there was no problems looming on the horizon.&amp;nbsp; In 2005, the republicans put a reform act before congress where they gave dire warnings about the state the economy will be in in just a few years if nothing was done.&amp;nbsp; By that tme, the republicans were no longer in the majority in congress and they got shot down with Pelosi&amp;nbsp; aking statements saying things were fine. Of course if the stupid republicans had gotten their thumbs out of their asses and did something about it when they had the majority, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess.&amp;nbsp; However they got fat and lazy being in power and didn't do anything about it. Now you have politicians out there pointing their fingers and assigning blame to everyone except themselves.&amp;nbsp; Now we're supposed to expect that we should look to them for the right leadership to get us out of this.&amp;nbsp; It's laughable.&amp;nbsp; I'll tust them more if they start owning up to the mess they made.&amp;nbsp; Fat chance of that happening.&amp;nbsp; The reason they are willing to come up with all this mnoey to "bail out" the financial markets is because they are trying to cover their asses.&amp;nbsp; Fact of the matter is, crediot isn't frozen.&amp;nbsp; You can still get home and car loans.&amp;nbsp; You can still get credit cards.&amp;nbsp; The problem is with the investment banks that invested heavily in the subprime MBS's.&amp;nbsp; We've already seen a couple of them either close (Washinton Mutual whose assets were purchased by JP Morgan Chase) or got part of their business sold off (Bank of America sold part of their business off, I don't remember to whom). Persoanlly, I don't think they should do anything.&amp;nbsp; The politicians all want to look like they're doing something.&amp;nbsp; Not a big surprise since their approval rating is even worse than Bush's.&amp;nbsp; (it's in single digits)&amp;nbsp; Not to mention that the bail out bill keeps getting all kinds of other crap hung on it like a Christmas tree like bail outs for Union pensions that are going to drive the cost up even more. I think what's worst is all the calls for keeping people in their homes.&amp;nbsp; I mean, I'm all for helping people out, but when the majority of people with loan problems are either 1) people who bought multiple homes trying to play the market or 2) people who couldn't afford a home loan and took one anyway, I don't think we should be bailing them out.&amp;nbsp; Someitmes in life you make a bad decision.&amp;nbsp; You need to live with the consequences.&amp;nbsp; How will people learn to make sound fiscal decisions in their life if the government turns aorund and bails them out every time?&amp;nbsp; What about all the people who have been paying their loans back?&amp;nbsp; Katie and I make out payment every month, so do you (as far as I know.&amp;nbsp; :)).&amp;nbsp; What does it say to us that we made sure everything was in order before we bought a house, made sure we could aafford it and didn't buy more house than we could afford, hear talk that amounts to giving houses away to people who can't afford them? I have less of a problem bailing out the banks since the government made the mess in the first place, then I do bailing out the people defaulting on their loans because they didn't think before buying their house or trying to play the market. (Fannie Mae was created back in 1938 by FDR's New Deal initiative to create a secondary mo...
