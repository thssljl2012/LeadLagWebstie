Please leave any comments there.after getting burned too many times by bank of america&amp;#8217;s rip-off algorithm, i figured taking into consideration of what a friend has told me and applying it to myself would make for an interesting experiment&amp;#8230; so i&amp;#8217;ve cancelled and shredded my check cards, called BoA and asked for an atm card with NO visa/mastercard logo on it, just give me the cirrus, cirrusly&amp;#8230;  now that i&amp;#8217;ve cut myself off from a rather large degree of easy access to my money, this has changed my situation quite a bit&amp;#8230; i now have a completely paid off credit card and an atm card, THAT&amp;#8217;S IT&amp;#8230; i hate using the credit card unless i really need to, so that cuts my want to purchase frivolously&amp;#8230; and believe it or not, i HATE having to go out of the way just to drive my fat arse to a bank or an atm just so i can get money that i need&amp;#8230; yes, i&amp;#8217;m THAT lazy&amp;#8230; but then again, simplification of processes always makes for easier documentation and tracking&amp;#8230; that could be the very thing i need to keep myself not-so-carefulness in check&amp;#8230; if that is the case, yay! now here&amp;#8217;s my next issue, sticking to this plan&amp;#8230;  is there such a thing as plan-keeping deficit disorder?
