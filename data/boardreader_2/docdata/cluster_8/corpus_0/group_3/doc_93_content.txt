   Not exactly a surprise, but yet another indicator that the backbone of America is solidly behind John McCain: ARLINGTON, VA &amp;#8212; McCain-Palin 2008 today announced that Richard Petty, widely known as the greatest driver in NASCAR history, is endorsing John McCain for president. Petty is announcing his endorsement at today&amp;#8217;s Bank of America 500 at Lowe&amp;#8217;s Motor Speedway in Charlotte , N.C. &amp;#8220;What we need right now in these uncertain times is a steady hand on the wheel &amp;#8212; a leader we can trust to put country first, ahead of politics,&amp;#8221; Petty said. &amp;#8220;John McCain has always done that, and if you need proof, think about the sacrifices he made for America . I don&amp;#8217;t think there is any question that John McCain is a proud American and he has done more to better America than anyone. &amp;#8220;John McCain has a plan to get our economy back on track not only for the folks here in North Carolina but also nationwide. He understands that higher taxes will only make things worse and he&amp;#8217;ll support small businesses and create jobs. He will get us on the road to energy independence and give our troops what they need to succeed in Iraq and Afghanistan . I&amp;#8217;m proud to support John McCain for president.&amp;#8221; Petty won 200 races during his career, a NASCAR record, and won a record seven Winston Cup championships. He won the Daytona 500 seven times, also a record, and won 27 races in 1967 alone. The people who do the work of the United States are for McCain/Palin - in opposition to those cynical, despairing people who hold America in contempt.  It really is time for all good men to come to the aid of their country and work for McCain&amp;#8217;s victory.
