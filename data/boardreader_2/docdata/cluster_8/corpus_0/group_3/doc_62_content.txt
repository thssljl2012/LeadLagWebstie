Still working on moving my site over to the new host. The most time consuming thing is getting all the photos off of livejournal. I still have a few galleries left... ugh. I find it funny that economists are saying that all the government actions (from all countries) must be working because the markets are going up. I think we've firmly established that the stock markets have nothing to do with the real economy. The whole point of these government actions is to get banks to lend to each other and to people, and they're still not doing that. In fact, many banks are running scams to screw people even further:A woman had a bank of america credit card for many years. They suddenly raised her rates. She called to ask why and they said because she had so many inquiries on her credit. So she pulled her report: BoA was the one making the inquiries. CitiBank is offering people a deal where they'll give cash back (pay down further balance) for every dollar you pay over your minimum payment, and then reduce your credit limit by that same amount. What they don't tell you is that reducing your credit limit lowers your credit score, at which point they'll raise your interest rates because suddenly your score has gone down.These are the companies we're bailing out with our tax dollars?
