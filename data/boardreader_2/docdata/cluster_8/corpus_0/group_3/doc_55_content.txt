I applied for a credit card a while back. Just a student one. Mostly because I'm paranoid about identity theft and don't want to be using my debit card everywhere, and also because having a line of credit makes some things-- like renting a car-- a hell of a lot easier possible. I didn't pay much attention to APRs because I intend to pay off my bill every month. Today, I get a call:"This is Bank of America. Were you aware that you have been approved for the Visa card you applied for?""Yes, I was. Thanks.""I see here that most of your income right now consists of student loans.""That's right.""Well, I'd like to offer you a platinum Mastercard in addition to the Visa, for which you have already been pre-approved, and which will give you the same credit limit.".....So, let me get this straight. You see that I have, for all intents and purposes, no income, and that in fact, I am living at a DEFICIT each month. If I am irresponsible with my budgeting, I *will* have difficulty paying off my bills, in which case I will be up to my eyeballs in debt. And yet, you offer me ANOTHER credit card?? It might be kind of fun to scalp off a student in the short-term with interest, but considering I have no assets to my name, what sense does this make in the long run? The deeper the hole I dig myself into, the less likely you will be paid back. Or don't they teach common sense in the econ department anymore?
