Several years ago (2005)) Joe Biden was one of the few Democrats who sided with credit-card companies that were trying to make it harder for people to declare bankruptcy. At the time, his son was a consultant to Delaware-based credit-card company MBNA. MBNA employees also contributed heavily to the senator's election campaigns. Bidens son, Hunter, received consulting fees from the MBNA Corporation from 2001 to 2005 for work on online banking issues. A company official had once described him as having a $100,000 a year retainer.The financial services industry began seeking relief from Congress in the mid-1990s from an increase in bankruptcies that was cutting into its profits. During that time, executives at MBNA, which was bought in 2006 by Bank of America, began donating heavily to both major political parties and many national politicians, including Mr. Biden.Consumer advocates say that Senator Biden was one of the first Democratic leaders to support the bankruptcy bill, and he voted for it four times  in 1998, 2000, 2001 and in March 2005, when its final version passed the Senate by a vote of 74 to 25. According to Travis Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer group that opposed the bill, Biden provided a veneer of bipartisanship that eventually helped the credit card companies win over other Democrats -- He provided cover to other Democrats to do what the credit industry was urging them to do, Mr. Plunkett said.
