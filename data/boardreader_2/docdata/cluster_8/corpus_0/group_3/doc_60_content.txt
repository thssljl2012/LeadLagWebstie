Dude, you&amp;#8217;re wrong:  A running clich of the political left and the press corps these days is that our current financial problems all flow from Congress&amp;#8217;s 1999 decision to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 that separated commercial and investment banking. Barack Obama has been selling this line every day. Bill Clinton signed that &amp;#8220;deregulation&amp;#8221; bill into law, and he knows better.  The former President goes into some more detail in the linked article but below is the nut graf:  &amp;#8220;But I have really thought about this a lot. I don&amp;#8217;t see that signing that bill had anything to do with the current crisis. Indeed, one of the things that has helped stabilize the current situation as much as it has is the purchase of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America, which was much smoother than it would have been if I hadn&amp;#8217;t signed that bill.&amp;#8221;  (my emphasis)   Say what you want to about Bill Clinton, and I have said plenty over the years, but when he is right he&amp;#8217;s right.
