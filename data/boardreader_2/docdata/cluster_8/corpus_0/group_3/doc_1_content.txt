But, since he wrapped up his party's nomination, John McCain has offered more of the same false attacks and smears. To date, independent, nonpartisan fact checkers have published more than 50 fact checks debunking John McCain's lies and distortions. To hold John McCain accountable to his own standard, the Democratic National Committee will count and chronicle the lies here on the McCainPedia's "Count the Lies" page. 128 Fact ChecksCNN: McCain's Subprime Lending Attack is "Misleading," Takes Obama's Words Out of Context. "In a campaign speech Wednesday, October 8, in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain questioned Democratic opponent Sen. Barack Obama's foresight on the role of the troubled subprime lending sector in the recent financial crisis. 'As recently as September of last year, he said that subprime loans had been  quote  a good idea,' McCain said. McCain is citing a statement Obama made during a September 17, 2007, speech in New York. While the words he quotes are technically accurate, McCain is taking them out of context from a statement that actually was criticizing abuses in the subprime sector ... The Verdict: Misleading. Obama did say subprime lending 'started off as a good idea,' but he was criticizing abuses in the sector. Based on his statements, he did not think they were a good idea last September, as McCain suggests."

"In last night's debate, Sen. John McCain repeated one of his regular complaints -- that Sen. Barack Obama said that he would strike targets inside Pakistan under certain conditions. McCain raises the issue to suggest that it is an example of Obama's inexperience in foreign affairs ... McCain has repeatedly mischaracterized Obama's statement to make a somewhat tendentious point: that Obama should not say he would 'attack Pakistan' because he should 'speak softly' about his plans. But Obama did not say that -- as has been noted by independent fact checkers many times -- and he merely articulated a policy that has been used by the current administration. THREE PINOCCHIOS: Significant factual errors." [Washington Post, 10/08/08: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/08/AR2008100800091_pf.html] AP: McCain Overstates Impact of Drilling. "McCAIN: 'Oil drilling offshore now is vital so we can bridge the gap between imported oil ... and it will reduce the price of a barrel of oil. ... We've got to drill offshore and do it now.' THE FACTS: The government estimates that opening the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and eastern Gulf of Mexico to drilling 'will not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030.' Even then, it would only increase domestic oil production by 3 percent."

"The cl.. Speaking about energy costs, McCain said: 'We've got to stop sending $700 billion a year to countries who don't like us that much.' The facts: McCain repeatedly makes this claim, which often has been criticized as exaggerated by non-partisan groups  including FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. The United States spends about $536 billion a year on imported oil, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. But about one-third of that goes to close U.S. allies of Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom."

'With the encouragement of Sen. Obama and his cronies,' McCain said, government-sponsored mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were key drivers of the financial crisis  'the match that started this forest fire.' ... The McCain campaign has produced no evidence, however, that Obama did favors for the corporations. In 2005, McCain co-sponsored a bill to step up regulation on Fannie and Freddie. Dodd and other Democrats voted against it in committee; it never came to a vote in the full Senate, so Obama did not vote on it."

"Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain said at the Oct. 7 presidential debate in Nashville, Tennessee, that Democratic opponent Sen. Barack Obama has 'never taken on his leaders of his party on a single issue.' Verdict: False. While McCain is correct that Obama has supported the Democratic leadership almost all of the time, to say he's never differed with them is not true." [CNN, 10/7/08: http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/07/fact-check-has-obama-never-taken-on-democratic-leaders/] Politifact.com: 94 Tax Votes? Not even close. "During the second presidential debate in Nashville, Tenn., McCain made the charge directly. 'Senator Obama has voted 94 times to either increase your taxes or against tax cuts. That's his record.' Ninety-four times? Not that we could find. But 94 still is awfully far away. The McCain campaign could easily claim that Obama has 'repeatedly' supported higher taxes according to his record in the Senate ... But by using such a precise number, the McCain campaign's charge carries a greater level of authority and credibility, which it really doesn't deserve. It's not merely that their count is wrong, but that they're misleading with their attempt at unsupported precision. We say False."

We hate to nitpick apparent misstatements, but this one's a doozy -- 1.3-million is the number of people worldwide who make some money off eBay, according to a 2006 A.C. Nielsen study. As of 2003, some 20,000 Americans made their living off eBay, company executive Jim Griffith told a Colorado newspaper at the time ... But it's not conceivable that the number of Americans making a living off eBay has climbed to 1.3-million. In 2005, the latest year for which statistics are available, just 724,000 Americans made money selling on eBay, according to a Nielsen study. But that includes many who made just a few bucks -- not a living ... This time, his number is more than a million higher, and not even conceivably true. McCain bought himself a False." [Politifact.com, 10/7/08: http://politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/778/] FactCheck.org: McCain Misleads on 2005 Energy Bill. "McCain accused Obama of voting for a 'Bush and Cheney' energy bill that gave away billions to oil companies. McCain is referring to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which Obama did in fact vote for. Sen. Clinton raised this same charge against Obama during the Democratic primaries. It was misleading then and it's equally misleading now. In fact, according to a Congressional Research Service report, more tax breaks were taken away from oil companies than were given. Overall, the Act resulted in a small net tax increase on the oil industry: Congressional Research Service: The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05, P.L. 109-58) included several oil and gas tax incentives, providing about $2.6 billion of tax cuts for the oil and gas industry. In addition, EPACT05 provided for $2.9 billion of tax increases on the oil and gas industry, for a net tax increase on the industry of nearly $300 million over 11 years. The bill did contain $14.3 billion in tax breaks, but most of those went to electric utilities, and nuclear, and also to alternative fuels research and subsidies for energy-efficient cars, homes and buildings - not to the oil industry."

"McCain said that Obama had voted 94 times for higher taxes or against tax cuts. He's getting warmer -- the first time we dinged him for this one, he said Obama voted 94 times to increase taxes, which is way off. This is still misleading, though. The real breakdown includes: 23 votes against tax cuts (which would have produced no increase in taxes); seven votes that would have lowered taxes for most people, but increased taxes on a few; 11 votes that would have increased taxes on those making over $1 million a year. The majority of the 94 votes (53 of them, including some of the above) were on budget measures, not tax bills, and would not have resulted in any tax change. Four other votes were non-binding motions related to conference report negotiations."

"McCain said that Obama's health care plan would mandate that 'small businesses' provide coverage for their employees and would fine them if they failed to do so. Actually, Obama's health care plan, posted on his Web site, says: 'Small businesses will be exempt from this requirement.' McCain previously used this charge in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention."
