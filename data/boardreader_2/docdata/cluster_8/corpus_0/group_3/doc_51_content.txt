     by Reena Kapoor A very interesting opinion piece in the WSJ&amp;#0160;(Bill vs. Barack on Banks) and words of wisdom from Bill Clinton on whether the much maligned 1999 decision of Congress&amp;#0160;to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 was in fact a mistake.&amp;#0160; Bill Clinton shows uncharacteristic understanding of how the markets work as he defends the decision and disagrees with Mr. Obama who continues to shock with his complete illiteracy on economics. Here is one of the insights Bill offers Barack ...  &amp;quot;But I have really thought about this a lot. I don't see that signing that bill had anything to do with the current crisis. Indeed, one of the things that has helped stabilize the current situation as much as it has is the purchase of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America, which was much smoother than it would have been if I hadn't signed that bill.&amp;quot;
