&amp;nbsp;Last week on September 27th a friend of mine who owed me money made a cash deposit into my account for $300. &amp;nbsp;He asked me to verify that the money went through, so I went online and checked. &amp;nbsp;Yes, his deposit was posted. &amp;nbsp;End of story!Wrong, the next day, I get my daily account notice email and notice the balance is off, so I go online and check. &amp;nbsp;The $300 is no where to be found, not even a notation that it was taken out. &amp;nbsp;Just vanished into thin air.A few days later I finally have the time to call BOA and of course they have no idea where the money is and ant proof from the receipt. &amp;nbsp;Lucky my friend kept the receipt and he gave me all the info from that.I called back (more time wasting, have I complained in the past about my inability it seems to make smooth phone calls) anyways, they took the info and said they would investigate the matter and that it may take u to 72 hours. &amp;nbsp; Now had it been me taking the $300 from them I would have been slapped with overdraft fee's from hell but never mind that.The following Monday I check and the money is back into my account.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Yesterday I get home and a letter arrived in the mail telling me the error was fixed and the money was deposited back into my account, which I already knew.So what's the problem? &amp;nbsp;This morning I get up and check my account and the $300 is once again gone, although this time it shows some weird ass numbers next to it showing it as a debt. &amp;nbsp;So I guess I will be calling them back.What the fuck?
