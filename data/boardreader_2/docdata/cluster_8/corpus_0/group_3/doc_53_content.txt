       A few posts back, I said this about the impending government bailout of the financial industry:So the government (via its new version of the RTC) becomes the mortgage holder for hundreds of thousands of Americans. Already the cry from Democrats is "People before profit."Will the US be able to resolve the most clear out the very worst of these loans in an fiscally responsible manner?If there is any possibility of making money on these loans, won't that cause an outcry on the Left?Jonah Goldberg points out:Democrats in Congress had great fun using Fannie and Freddie as public policy  piggy banks, rewarding constituencies, funding pet projects, forcing the private  sector to dance to their tune. Whats to stop them from renegotiating this  weeks deal after the election and using Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan  Chase and the others as Fannie Mae 2.0?Please dont say that the terms  of the deal are set and the government cant revise them. If theres one thing  the last month has hammered home, its that nothing is written in stone.  Besides, the banks may grow to like the security of partial nationalization and  even lobby to Congress to stay on as less-than-fully-silent  partners.Heck, that way they wouldnt have to pay back the loans.I never thought of that.Banks might tout the participation of the government as a way to sell their stock, "Hey, the government won't let us fail!"
