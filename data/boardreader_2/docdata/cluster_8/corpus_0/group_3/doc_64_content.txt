This is just irritating from a reporter:  But Mondays hearing was illuminating only in what it showed about Congresss sorry willingness to use a national emergency to score political points. Representative Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York, pressed a panel of experts who appeared before Mr. Fuld to say whether the crisis had been caused by the abolition of Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that had separated commercial banks from investment banks. (Yes or no! she demanded.) She was implying that Republicans were the villains by tearing down financial regulation  which may well be true, though the example she picked was a poor one. The companies that have best withstood the crisis are those that took advantage of the end of Glass-Steagall to form one-stop-shopping banks: Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of America. The companies that have fallen are the stand-alone investment banks: Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. The bill that repealed Glass-Stegall was more than a bill that allowed 'one stop shopping' in the financial services industry. It also created an environment where all kinds of transactions and products became unregulated. But it is still annoying to read this reporter, in essence, defending the repeal because something hasn't happened yet. How does he know? And doesn't he realize how concentrated the risk is now? What happens if a Merrill drags BoA down? What then? What about Citi's investment banking arm? What if it drags Citi down? What then? Lousy reporting. Lousy analysis.
