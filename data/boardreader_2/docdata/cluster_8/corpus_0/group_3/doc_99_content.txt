Since the early 1980s profits from the financial service industry rose from 10 percent of total corporate profits to 40 percent today.  It's high time to close America's financial casinos, and I for one would not trust a McCain/Palin administration, recent converts to regulation, to stop this disastrous game of making money out of money without sufficient regulation. Read the full version.  All year long John McCain has repeated, at least 17 times, George Bush's mantra: "The fundamentals of the American economy are strong."   The last time he said it was September 15, right after Lehman Brothers folded, Merrill Lynch was bought by Bank of America, and American International Group, the world's largest financial insurer, was on the edge of collapse.    McCain has admitted that he knows very little about economics, and this gaffe proved that in spades. McCain thought that as president he could fire the chairman of the Security and Exchange Commission (no way, Senator), and his running mate Sarah Palin was blithely unaware that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were semi-private companies.  McCain once said that there has been "great economic progress" under Bush, but, less than 24 hours later, he stated that "Americans are not better off than they were eight years ago."  As far as America's working people are concerned, the economy tanked long ago.
