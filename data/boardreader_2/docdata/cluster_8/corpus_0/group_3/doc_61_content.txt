            So with my brigade fully out of Bodog and not having any sportsbetting action for a few weeks, I finally caved in and signed onto sportsbook.com. I tried my American Airlines Citibank MasterCard. It said "Over the credit limit," which is funny for a $200 transaction on a card that is completely clean. Whatever.The second card I used, a Bank of America Alaska Airlines Visa, went through fine.It's funny- isn't it supposed to be impossible for US credit cards to have transactions with online sportsbooks?Makes you go hmmm...
