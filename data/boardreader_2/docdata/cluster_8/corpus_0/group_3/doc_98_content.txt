This problem in America that we are having,&amp;nbsp;the huge debt in our economy thanks largely to the massive debt that the credit bureau is facing. There is a simple fix for it, put limitations on the credit card companies and who they send credit cards to. Every Tom, Dick, and Harry out there can easily get a credit card, use those cards to the max, but have no money to pay them off with. DUH!!  There was a story with a 6 yr old kid here in Florida that had received a credit card (yes that is true, through Bank of America). His mom thought it was a joke so they filled out the application, put $0.00 for income, and yet STILL received a card.&amp;nbsp; They made it public how much of a farce the card company was and B.O.A. stopped the card immediately. Not to even mention all the kids in college that receive dozens of card applications a week. I know I am not even in college anymore but I was receiving on average 14 card applications a week down here in Florida (no lie). I since filled out those privacy things and got them stopped, but still.  NO WONDER THIS COUNTRY IS IN DEBT! BLAME THE STUPID ASSHOLES OF THE CREDIT CARD COMPANIES!!! I guarantee you... if they stop issuing cards to EVERYONE, I am sure that would solve the problems this country is facing with the recession and looming depression. My name is Chad and I approve this message.  &amp;nbsp;
