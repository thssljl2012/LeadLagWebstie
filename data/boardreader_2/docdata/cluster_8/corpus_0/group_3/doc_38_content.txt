Dare Obasanjo has a good post onstabilizing house prices. He makes reference to the 8 billion dollar renegotiation by Bank of America/Countrywide for bad mortgages.  I agree that this is something that a moral bank would have done without a lawsuit. But still it is good that it is getting done. Washington state is getting 200 million. My question is who gets to renegotiate? Is it the homeowners that were truly victims of fraud? Or is it going to be the homeowners who thought they could make a buck with a quick flip in 2 years? For those that were truly victims of fraud, yes, renegotiate. But for those making 50K who bought a 400K house on a &amp;#8220;create your own payment&amp;#8221; mortgage (the kind you don&amp;#8217;t even have to pay all the interest on) to try and sell for 500K in 24 months, no, no negotiating. You made a risky investment decision, and you got caught. Deal with the consequences. If I invest on margin (i.e. borrow money from the broker) and lose, guess what the broker still get&amp;#8217;s his money. I can&amp;#8217;t negotiate out of it. I took a chance and lost. Anyway just for kicks, I went and looked at Zillow to see how much my home has &amp;#8220;dropped&amp;#8221;. Unfortunately, my community is so new that the Zillow map still shows construction vehicles on a grass field where my cul-de-sac will eventuallly be  No prices for me. Of course, I know how much my house listed at, and I know how much they are listing my style house now. I don&amp;#8217;t put too much stock in that number because the builder is probably selling lower than they want just to get inventory off the &amp;#8220;shelves&amp;#8221; so to speak. But since this is my house and not my make 100K in 3 year investment, I&amp;#8217;m not (too) worried.
