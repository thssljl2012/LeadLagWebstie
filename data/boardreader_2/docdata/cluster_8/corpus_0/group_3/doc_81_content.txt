Bill Clinton speaks truth to anyone who will listen . . ."A running clich of the political left and the press corps these days is that our current financial problems all flow from Congress's 1999 decision to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 that separated commercial and investment banking. Barack Obama has been selling this line every day. Bill Clinton signed that "deregulation" bill into law, and he knows better."Here's some more truth about the Glass-Steagall Act from Wizbang:" . . . the soon-to-be-infamous-if-Democrats-have-their-way repeal of the Glass-Stegall Act. This, they say, is the REAL culprit. Unfortunately, there are a few problems with that theory.First up, it passed the Senate by a vote of 90-8, meaning that a LOT of Democrats -- including John Kerry and Joe Biden, just to name a couple -- voted for repealing it.Second, it was signed into law by Bill Clinton, who still says that it was a good law, and had nothing to do with the current situation.Finally, it has been used in this current crisis -- when Bank of America stepped in and bought out Merrill Lynch. Had it not been for the repeal of Glass-Steagall, Bank of America (a commercial bank) would have been forbidden to buy Merrill Lynch (an investment bank) without some serious paperwork and red tape and whatnot, and it would have been up to the government to step in -- or stand by while it collapsed entirely.
