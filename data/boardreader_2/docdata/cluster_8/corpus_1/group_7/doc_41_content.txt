THE SAGINAW NEWS  State Rep. Andy Coulouris says homeowners should have more time to cut a deal with lenders to avoid foreclosure.  Coulouris, chairman of the House Banking and Fiscal Services Committee, said he will introduce legislation to give borrowers 90 days to work out a deal with lenders to stave off foreclosure.  The Saginaw Democrat was to roll out the proposal today at press conferences in Saginaw and Lansing.  Saginaw County's Register of Deeds reports foreclosures reached an all-time high of 1,130 in 2008.  The legislation, which could reach House lawmakers this week, would allow time to work out revised loans, Coulouris said. Federal officials expect to roll out separate plans.  The White House said President Barack Obama on Wednesday will outline his plan to spend at least $50 billion to prevent foreclosures.  Last week, government-controlled mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and major banks JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp., said they are halting foreclosures of owner-occupied homes through Friday, March 6.  Homeowners aren't alone in the sting of foreclosure: Neighbors, the housing market and a community's tax base all suffer, Coulouris said.  ''The reality is every home that goes into foreclosure hurts,'' he said.  Marcia R. Hoffman -- she takes calls from people facing foreclosure as a housing specialist at Neighborhood Renewal Services of Saginaw Inc., 427 Atwater -- questions how effective the legislation will prove. Will the lenders work with the borrowers? she asked.  CONTINUED 1   2   3 Next
