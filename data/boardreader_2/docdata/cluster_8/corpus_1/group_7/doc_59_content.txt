Over the last few years, I have been inundated with offers from banks and financial institutions, some of which I have never dealt with. Just for curiositys sake, I decided to keep track in 2008 of exactly how many I have received.   The Bank of America led with 32, followed by Citibank with 23. AAA was next with 21, followed by Chase with 17. Then came American Express with 12, Discover and HSBC with nine each and Wells Fargo with three. Consider, if you will, how much money has been spent for paper, ink, printing and postageand I am only one person.   With almost two months into 2009, I have already received offers from two of these institutions for a total of six. How unconscionable are these institutions inasmuch as the U. S. government has chosen to bail them out?   Geraldine D. Frieday   Akron more &gt;&gt;
