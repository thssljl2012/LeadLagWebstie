 Banks nickel-and-dime the jobless UNDATED - First, Arthur Santa-Maria called Bank of America to ask how to check the balance of his new unemployment benefits debit card. The bank charged him 50 cents.   He chose not to complain. That would have cost another 50 cents.   So he took out some of the money and then decided to pull out the rest. But that made two withdrawals on the same day, and that was $1.50.   For hundreds of thousands of workers losing their jobs during the recession, there's a new twist to their financial pain: Even when they're collecting unemployment benefits, they're paying the bank just to get the money -- or even to call customer service to complain about it.   Bank of America spokeswoman Britney Sheehan said the cards offer convenience, especially for those in rural areas or people without a relationship with a bank who would have to pay fees to cash a check.
