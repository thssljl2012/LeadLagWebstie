ANZ has warned internet customers not to respond to a fake form that asks for personal details when they log onto the bank's website.  The bank said the form appeared after customers using internet banking had successfully logged on. 'This is not a legitimate form,' ANZ warned. Customers must not fill in the form and should immediately end their internet banking session, the bank said.  ANZ's internet banking help desk can provide more information on 131350.
