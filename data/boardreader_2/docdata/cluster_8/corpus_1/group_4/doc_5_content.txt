TO THE EDITOR: I've had about all the cracks about the "socialism" of Barrack Obama I can stomach. Let's see, at the behest of Secretary of Commerce Paulson (former CEO of Goldman, Sachs one of the investment banks taxpayers just bailed out to the tune of $700 billion), the Bush Administration has just advanced another $70 billion dollars, on top of the $85 billion!!! taxpayer dollars already given, to keep AIG, the largest insurance company in America from going broke. In other words the taxpayers, whose homes are being foreclosed by AIG, are paying to bail out the mortgage company that is taking their home. Sounds like redistribution of wealth to me. Let's drink to George W. Bush, the man who nationalized the insurance and investment banks in the US, the most successful socialist in US history.   Charles David Morison   Hampstead
