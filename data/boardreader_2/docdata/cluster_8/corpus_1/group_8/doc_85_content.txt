Executives at the troubled US insurance giant AIG are under mounting pressure to hand back the hefty bonuses they have just received.  AIG has paid out more than $250 million in bonuses despite relying on government bailout money to stay in business.  The US Congress is looking at ways of imposing punitive taxes on the bonuses. Democratic  says the payments are unacceptable. 'This is disgraceful, this is unacceptable and it is an offence to millions of hardworking Americans whose tax dollars are the only reason AIG continues to exist.' Republican  has suggested AIG executives should adopt a Japanese approach toward accepting responsibility for their failings by resigning or committing suicide.
