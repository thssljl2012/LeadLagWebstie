WASHINGTON - Senior administration official sources say President Barack Obama learned only last Thursday that insurance giant AIG was paying employees millions of dollars in bonuses.  The bonus pay has caused an uproar because the American International Group Inc. has relied on billions of dollars of taxpayer help for survival.  The White House has faced questions about when, exactly, Obama learned that AIG executives were going to get $165 million in bonus pay.  Officials for the first time on Tuesday night said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told the White House last Thursday, and senior aides informed the president later that day.
