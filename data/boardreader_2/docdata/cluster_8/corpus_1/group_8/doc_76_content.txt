Insurance giant AIG has received more than $170 billion dollars in federal bailout money, and now it has been learned that after accepting that money, AIG paid out millions of dollars in bonuses to executives.  AIG contends the bonuses are part of employee contracts and must be honored.  Montana's Congressional delegation are among the outraged on Capitol Hill.  Representative Denny Rehberg (R-MT) released a statement saying, 'These shameful bonuses represent 165 million reasons why I have opposed every single one of these bailouts. AIG's actions further underscore the fact that these massive bills pushed through Congress with little to no oversight are simply a bad deal for taxpayers.'  Both Montana Senators also had warnings for AIG.  Jon Tester (D-MT) said, 'It is not right to be occurring, because this company would be out of business and those people would be on the street. And they need to understand that the only reason that they even have a job is because of the taxpayers and their ability to put money to do this.'  Max Baucus (D-MT) echoed those sentiments: 'I don't know what they were thinking, that's the problem I don't think they were thinking...with all the people who were thrown out of work trying to make ends meet and these people take these big bonuses from companies that are causing a lot of the problems facing our country. It's totally wrong and I'm going to do all I can to make sure these bonuses are recouped and it doesn't happen again.'  Baucus has suggested a significant tax on the bonus money, and is expected to propose legislation in coming days.  Senator Baucus was among several lawmakers who accepted campaign donations from AIG during the 2008 campaign.
