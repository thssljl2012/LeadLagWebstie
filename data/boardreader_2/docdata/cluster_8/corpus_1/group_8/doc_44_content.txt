Angry members of the US Congress have told executives of the American International Group they will be taxed heavily if they accept bonus payments.  AIG, the troubled US insurance company, was propped up by $170 billion of government money, when it looked as though it might fail.  The disclosure of millions of dollars in bonus payments going to AIG executives has sparked a wave of outrage in the United States, with members of Congress suggesting special taxes against AIG executives who take the bonus money.
