Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley's office is in spin mode today after Grassley suggested that AIG executives who are responsible for the collapse of the insurance giant should either resign or commit suicide.  'I suggest, you know, obviously, maybe they ought to be removed,' Grassley said. 'But I would suggest the first thing that would make me feel a little bit better toward them if they'd follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say, I'm sorry, and then either do one of two things: resign or go commit suicide.  'And in the case of the Japanese, they usually commit suicide before they make any apology.'
