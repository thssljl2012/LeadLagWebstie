A key US Senator said Tuesday he was looking at possible tax mechanisms to reclaim about 165 million dollars in bonuses paid to top executives of bailed-out insurance giant AIG.  'Americans are angry, I am angry: 4.5 million Americans have lost their jobs, and these people are getting bonuses, multi-million-dollar bonuses,' said Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus, a Democrat.  His comments came as US lawmakers groped for a response amid deep public outrage that American International Group (AIG), the beneficiary of 180 billion dollars in taxpayer rescue funding, would pay out bonuses to some of the key players that brought ruin to the insurance giant.  'While we're on the topic of scams, I'm looking very closely at tax options that will reclaim the bonuses paid by AIG,' Baucus said as his committee kicked off a hearing on Ponzi scheme fraud and overseas tax dodges.  Senator Charles Grassley, the panel's top Republican, signalled support for such a move, telling Baucus 'I want to back you up on looking in to that and doing what we can to make sure that these things don't happen in the future.'
