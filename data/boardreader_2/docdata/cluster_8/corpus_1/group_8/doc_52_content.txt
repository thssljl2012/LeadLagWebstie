73 former and current employees of insurance giant AIG got some pretty nice bonuses on Friday. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo reports they each received bonus checks of one million dollars or more as the company took in 170 billion in bailout cash. Folks on the street are not too pleased to hear about where their tax dollars are going.  Colonie resident Gloria Potter said, 'They're not deserving it, if their company is going down if you've got a job or business you don't pay the guys that are in charge.'The outrage is now extending to the White House and Capitol Hill. Rep. Paul Tonko and Sen. Chuck Schumer are calling on the company's CEO to return the money, but if that doesn't happen, Sen. Chuck Schumer said, 'We will act and we will take this money back and return it to its rightful owners, the American taxpayers. We will take this money back by taxing virtually all of it.'But some believe lawmakers should have been more careful from the beginning.  Albany resident Tim Ford said, 'They shouldn't be complaining because you gave them the money but I don't like the idea, they gave them the money.'Abigail Doolittle of Johnson, Illington Advisers said, 'There's something morally that doesn't sit well with people.'Financial analyst Abigail Dootlittle says AIG made huge risky bets and is now entagled with so many financial firms and its failure could've been worse for the economy. The government now owns 80 percent of AIG, which is uncharted territory for sure.Doolittle said, 'If these employees are forced to give back their bonuses that are potentially funded by the government, what sort of slippery slope does it create for any sort of business that does some sort of business with the government.'Congressman Tonko said, 'These bonuses show AIG's shear arrogance and total insensitivity.'AIG says they are contractually obligated to payout the bonuses.  The CEO is scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.
