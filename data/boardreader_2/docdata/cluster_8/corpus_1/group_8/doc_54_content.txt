NO ONE in Washington is safe from the story of AIG's $165m in employee bonuses, especially after it became known that the company used its bail-out money to 'make millionaires' out of 73 of the company's employees. RepublicansRepublicans!are gearing up to attack Democrats for not writing language into bail-out legislation that would have prevented AIG from giving out bonuses.  Anthony Randazzo sees a 'mob mentality' driving everyone to irrational behaviour. 'The bonuses were put in place sometime in early 2008, before AIG collapsed,' Mr Randazzo argues. 'They are basically performance based contracts, closely linked to people staying at the firm.' Another defender of the bonuses is that stalwart ally of Barack Obama... Rush Limbaugh. 'I have all of my insurance policies, or most of my insurance policies, with AIG,' said Mr Limbaugh on his show when the news broke, 'and it would be a hassle for me if AIG went bankrupt or if they were allowed to fail.'  This is calm; this is correct. It's madness to indulge, the way Congress is indulging, in a full-blown witch trial and panic over a financial decision that, at most, charged every American $0.49 in order to keep AIG running.
