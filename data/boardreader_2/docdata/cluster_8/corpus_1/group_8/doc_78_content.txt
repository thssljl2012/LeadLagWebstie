President Barack Obama hit out at the 'outrage' of executives at struggling insurance giant AIG receiving millions of dollars in bonuses.  AIG has received more than $170 billion from the US Treasury since September last year.  The insurer is now 80%-owned by the state as a result of attempts to prop up the struggling firm.  The bonuses that sparked Mr Obama's comments relate to money to be handed out to around 400 employees of AIG Financial Products.  The extra cash was agreed last year before AIG went cap in hand to the government.  Mr Obama indicated that his administration was working with new AIG chief executive Edward Liddy to address the issue and stop further payments.
