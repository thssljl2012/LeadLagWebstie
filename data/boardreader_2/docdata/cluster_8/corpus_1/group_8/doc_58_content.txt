In a rare flash of public anger, President Barack Obama today pledged to stop a 165-million dollar bonus payout by bailed-out insurance giant Amercian Insurance Group (AIG) to its executives, according to news reports.  Obama said the planned bonuses for AIG executives and traders were an 'outrage', according to AFP.  'This is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed,' he said, at a White House event with owners of small businesses.  'How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat,' Obama added, even though the company received more than $170 billion in federal rescue money.  A public backlash against Washington over the bonuses would make it tougher for Obama to ask Congress later for more bailout help  and jeopardize other parts of the recovery agenda that has dominated the early weeks of his presidency, said a report in the International Herald Tribune.
