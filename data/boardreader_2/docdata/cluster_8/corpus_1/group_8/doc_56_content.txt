ROCKFORD (WREX) - Illinois Senator Dick Durbin says he's furious over the misuse of funds by insurance giant AIG.  Word of American International Group paying $165 million in executive bonuses after receiving more than $170 billion in federal rescue money sparked outrage across the country Monday.  'I'm trying to contain my rage at the thought that we would send $180 billion to AIG because the company is failing and in the midst of its failure, we are saving them from bankruptcy and they're declaring bonuses for their employees. Bonuses, in most life experience, go to people who have done a good job, who are being rewarded for good work. How could you look at AIG today and say the people there deserve bonuses if they would have been out of business without the federal taxpayers? There is a sense of outrage about this,' said Durbin.  AIG says legally it had to pay those bonuses because it scheduled them in contracts signed last year before it got the bailout.  New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has opened an investigation to see if the employees set to get those bonuses were involved in the company's downfall.  Meanwhile, AIG says it has agreed to requests from the Obama administration to cut back on such large bonuses in the future. But Obama says he still plans to try to stop the bonuses from being paid.  AIG recently reported losses of $61.7 billion for the fourth quarter of last year, the largest corporate loss in history.
