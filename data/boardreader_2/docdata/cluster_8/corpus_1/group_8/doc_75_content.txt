Despite receiving more than $170 billion in taxpayer bailouts and posting the largest quarterly loss in U.S. corporate history, it's still business as usual at AIG, which announced plans to pay $165 million in bonuses.  How a company so patently drained of profitability could rationalize bonuses for executives, including some of the derivatives traders whose recklessness brought the insurance giant to its knees, is testament to the disconnect between Wall Street and the rest of country.  AIG officials claim they are obligated to make the payments under contracts signed before the company suffered financial meltdown last fall. Obama administration officials generally echo that interpretation although the president, trying to deflect public anger, vowed to stop the payments. An additional $30 billion pending government payment may provide the White House leverage.  Once the world's largest insurance conglomerate, AIG earned a reputation for recklessness through its financial products unit, which sold hundreds of billions of credit-default swaps designed to minimize investors' risk. But these derivatives were highly leveraged and when loans went sour, AIG was obligated to cover the defaults but lacked the necessary financial reserves. To avert a cascading financial meltdown, the Federal Reserve began shoveling money into AIG and took a management stake that now totals 80 percent.  Although AIG and the Fed had balked at identifying companies that had benefited from the rescue, some of the names were revealed over the weekend: Goldman Sachs ($12.9 billion), Merrill Lynch ($6.8 billion), Bank of America ($5.2 billion), Citigroup ($2.3 billion) and Wachovia ($1.5 billion) as well as several big foreign banks.  It's unclear whether those claims were paid off in full or whether the recipients were forced to absorb some of the losses from their risky investments. The suspicion is that, like those ubiquitous bonuses, the taxpayer pays the tab.
