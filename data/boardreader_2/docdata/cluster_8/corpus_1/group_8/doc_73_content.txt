President Barack Obama has hit out at the 'outrage' of executives at struggling insurance giant AIG receiving millions of dollars in bonuses.  In an angry statement, Mr Obama said the company's financial problems were the result of 'recklessness and greed'.  As such it was hard to justify 165 million dollars (117 million) in extra pay to executives, he said.  AIG has received more than 170 billion dollars (120 billion) in bailout cash from the government.  The insurer is now 80%-owned by the state as a result of attempts to prop up the struggling firm.  The government stepped in amid concern that if allowed to fail, AIG's collapse would have far-reaching consequences, deepening the global recession.  Since being installed as president, Mr Obama has stressed the importance of firms being made to be accountable over money they receive from taxpayers. It followed growing concern over the use of the first tranche of bailout cash, and public disgust over bonuses and other executive perks such as private jets.  The bonuses that sparked the comments from the president relate to money to be handed out to around 400 employees of AIG Financial Products.  The extra cash was agreed last year before AIG went cap in hand to the government. The 165 million dollars due to be paid out this week is part of a larger payout of around 450 million dollars (319 million).  Mr Obama indicated that his administration was working with new AIG chief executive Edward Liddy to address the issue. He said: 'This is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due to recklessness and greed.'
