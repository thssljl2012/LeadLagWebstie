PRESIDENT Barack Obama has hit out at the outrage of executives at struggling insurance giant AIG receiving millions of dollars in bonuses.  In an angry statement, Mr Obama said AIGs financial problems were the result of recklessness and greed. As such it was hard to justify $165 million (117 million) in extra pay to executives, he said.  AIG has received more than $170 billion (120 billion) in bailout cash from the government. And the insurer is now 80%-owned by the state as a result of attempts to prop up the struggling firm.  The government stepped in amid concern that if allowed to fail, AIGs collapse would deepen the global recession.  The bonuses that sparked Barack Obamas comments relate to money to be handed out to around 400 employees of AIG Financial Products.  The extra cash was agreed last year before AIG went cap in hand to the government.   The $165m due to be paid out this week is part of a larger payout of around $450m (319m).  Since being installed as president, Mr Obama has stressed that firms should be made accountable over money they receive from taxpayers. Mr Obama said: All across the country, there are people who work hard and meet their responsibilities every day, without the benefit of government bail-outs or multi-million dollar bonuses. All they ask is that everyone, from Main Street to Wall Street, play by the same rules. AIG spokeswoman Christina Pretto said: We are in contact with the attorney general and will of course respond to his request.
