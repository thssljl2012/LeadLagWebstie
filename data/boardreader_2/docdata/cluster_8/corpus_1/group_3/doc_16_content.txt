Fraudulent e-mails about the Halifax bank and Yorkshire-based Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley have more than tripled as criminals try to cash in on customers' anxiety, figures show. Anti-spam company ClearMyMail says it has seen a 246 per cent surge in spam and phishing e-mails about the groups and Lloyds TSB, which is acquiring the Halifax's parent group HBOS. The group said fraudsters are trying to trick worried and vulnerable accountholders into revealing their account information and passwords.
