As one member of the Keating Five in 1989, Sen. John McCain provided insider favors for close friend and owner of bankrupt Lincoln Savings &amp;amp; Loan, Charles Keating, by pressuring federal regulators to drop their investigation of Keating for allowing risky investments. Ultimately, thousands of mostly elderly Lincoln depositors lost their life savings.The taxpayer bailout cost $3 billion. Keating went to prison. McCain was admonished by the Senate Ethics Committee for using "poor judgment" and admitted it was the worst mistake of his life. But after his election to Congress in 1982, McCain began chipping away at deregulating great Depression-era banking restrictions (Garn-St. Germain Act 1982; HCR 363, 98th Congress) enforced in the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 that safeguarded against fraud and mismanagement. Even as late as 2003 McCain said: "I am a deregulator. I believe in deregulation." But his recent declaration that "the fundamentals of our economy are strong" belies a reality that McCain helped foster the latest financial crisis during his two decades in Congress and suggests McCain has learned nothing from the Keating Five scandal that nearly ended his political career.So much for connecting the dots as presidential candidate McCain now favors deregulating health reform as well. Recently he wrote: "Opening up the health-insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation."Connect the dots.
