There has been a vast increase in spam making reference to troubled high street banks.ClearMyMail has revealed that there has been a 246 per cent increase in the number of spam and phishing emails relating to Halifax, Lloyd TSB and Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley.The company was able to prevent all of the fraudulent emails reaching their customers inbox's as ruthless fraudsters tried to target worried bank account holders.The company has warned email users to automatically delete messages that contain the Subject Title Important Message from Halifax Bank', and the same for Lloyds TSB and Bradford &amp;amp; Bingley, as these are the most popular titles being used by criminals trying to gain security passwords and information.The large majority of these fraudulent emails are being tracked to senders based in USA and Canada but scammers are using increasingly sophisticated technology to cover their tracks.Dan Field, managing director of ClearMyMail, said: This is a particularly cruel batch of phishing emails that are looking to target worried and vulnerable UK banking customers and demonstrates that unprotected inboxes are particularly exposed at this time.It is not just our UK customers who are being targeted, as our American clients also had an increase in Lehman Brothers fraudulent emails over the past week, but not at the same scale as here in the UK.The emails are mostly being sent from America, with others originating from Canada, UK, Brazil and Romania respectively.
