Deeply unsettled by the foreclosure crisis ravaging Hub neighborhoods, Mayor  yesterday sent an unprecendented plea to more than a dozen banks and mortgage companies urging them to agree to a six-month moratorium on foreclosures while the economy struggles through its current quagmire. I urge you to halt foreclosures, so that we can bring stability to our families and neighborhoods in this time of deep uncertainty, Menino said in his letter, noting that one in 10 U.S. homeowners has fallen behind on mortgage payments.  The city said it has identified about 500 homeowners who would need the relief immediately, and that an unspecified number could fall into crisis as unemployment continues to soar. As of Oct. 31, 1,039 homes had been foreclosed in Boston in 2008, according to city data. There were 961 banked-owned properties as of mid-October. With the countrys continued economic instability and rising unemployment, even families who made wise choices on mortgage lending and smart credit decisions have been badly affected, Menino said in a statement.  Among the 18 lenders receiving the plea are mortgage giants such as Indy Mac Federal Bank, J.P. Morgan Chase &amp;amp; Co., Bank of America, GMAC and Citigroup. We looked at the lenders with the largest amounts of mortgages, said Pat Canavan, the mayors housing adviser. Canavan said Menino is the first American mayor to issue such a letter.  Moratoriums on foreclosures have been on the wish lists of many mayors and governors lobbying President-elect Barack Obama in the months preceding his inauguration. Lenders and lawmakers have been generally lukewarm to the idea because it could further stall what small amounts of revenue are being generated for lenders being bailed out by the government.  Menino writes that private and public sector efforts to stem the foreclosure crisis have yet to produce a solution. A moratorium, he writes, will give the incoming Obama adminstration time to develop a plan that works. Its fair to say that the servicing industry has tried to come up with something to get out of this mess and nothings really worked, said Canavan. Its not working.
