A WOMAN who applied to open a bank account was sent another customer's account details and driving licence. Copies of Robert Copsey's personal data - which also included his address, telephone number and date of birth - was posted to Jeannet Foster's home in Middleton by Barclays. She said: 'I had been waiting for a letter from the bank, but was amazed to find someone else's details inside. 'There was everything a crook would need to turn this man's life upside down. If I wasn't honest, I could do all sorts with that much information. I'm just left wondering who has mine. 'It's a terrible mistake for a company you're meant to trust with your money. ' I don't think I'd want to open an account with them now.' Mr Copsey, from Irlam, who had been into the bank's Frodsham branch, said: 'I'm just lucky that my details landed on the doorstep of an honest person and I hope she has the same luck. ' It's really scary to think this would happen with a bank which is meant to be a reliable institution. 'I was concerned that my documents had not been returned and went into a couple of branches and called a helpline to see what had happened. 'I was just told to give it a bit longer and eventually I received my driving licence and bank statement, but little did I know copies had also been sent to a complete stranger.' A spokesman for Barclays said: 'We are aware of Miss Foster's complaint which is currently being treated as a priority. 'This is an isolated incident for which we offer our apologies. 'Barclays takes its duty to safe guard the personal property of its customers very seriously and will be taking the appropriate steps to ensure that instances such as this do not re-occur.'
