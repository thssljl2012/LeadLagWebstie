"This approach is typical of how the big banks and insurers have behaved in the PPI market for years, Sara-Ann Burgess, managing director at , says. "They have been quick to profit by selling over priced policies to customers who in many cases were not even been eligible to claim on the insurance. "Now when genuine people, with genuine fears come to take out cover they are refused."

"After years of profiteering, the biggest players are starting to pull up the ladder and leave customers who need their help behind," she says. "PPI is there to protect people in the face of redundancy and it strikes me as sharp practice for the likes of these insurers to be refusing applications from staff at companies going through turbulent times."
