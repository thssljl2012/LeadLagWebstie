Lloyds said that the new services are unique in giving customers the ability to move money instantly between accounts through a mobile banking application and receive text messages about their finances.According to Lloyds, using the new service customers can opt to set up high balance and low balance alerts to advise them when their current account balances reach, exceed or fall below certain levels. They can then instantly transfer money into their savings account, or move money into their current account as needed using their mobile phone. Through the mobile banking application customers will also be able to top up their own, or other 'pay as you go' mobile phones, direct from their current account.The new service will also include an overseas transaction alert. Subscribers will receive an alert if their debit card is used to withdraw cash from a cashpoint or to make a purchase abroad, said Lloyds.  UK-based Lloyds TSB has launched the new Lloyds TSB Mobile Services, allowing customers to monitor and manage their money on a mobile phone.
