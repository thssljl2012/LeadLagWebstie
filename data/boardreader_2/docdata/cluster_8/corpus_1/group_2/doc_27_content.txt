Everything you need to know about picking Isas: Picking the best IsaFREE BROCHURES- Isa funds- 100k to invest- Investing in wine- Spread bettingUnder the terms and conditions of most loan and savings agreements, banks have the right to take funds from a customer's savings and current accounts to repay outstanding loans with them under banks' little-known 'right of offset'.The right is an off-shoot of the Innkeepers Act 1878, under which innkeepers or hoteliers traditionally have the right to sell patron's possessions by public auction if they fail to pay for their bread and board.For example, if a bank customer found they were unable to pay an outstanding loan or credit card bill, and they also had savings deposits with the same bank, that institution has the right to take money from these accounts to pay the outstanding bill.Those who have debts with a different bank to their savings are safe from their ledner forcing them to balacne the books.However the rule applies across banking brands belonging to the same group, according to British Bankers Association guidelines. Therefore a savings account with RBS could be raided to pay off a NatWest loan as both brands exist within the same banking group.Similarly, the same will apply across the combined HBOS-Lloyds TSB behemoth following the merger of the former's brands  including Halifax, Bank of Scotland, Intelligent Finance, AA and Birmingham Midshires  with the latter's Lloyds and Cheltenham &amp;amp; Gloucester titles.As the resulting 'super bank' will take up approximately a third of the nation's savings market and a third of its mortgage market, a large proportion of UK savings and loans will be susceptible to the 'right to off-set' rule.A spokesperson for the BBA said: 'Banks routinely use this capability, but only when the relationship with the client has gone badly wrong.'A spokesperson for HBOS added: 'This is only used as a last resort. To prevent it from happening, the best advice if you miss a payment is to get in touch with us to discuss your ability to pay. This is only used when people fail to get in touch or are unwilling to discuss payment.'The rule also forms part of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which dictates that all compensation payments to customers from failed banks should be paid net of any liabilities; a customer's outstanding loans should be deducted from any savings refunded.However the Treasury Select Committee called this into doubt during the week by suggesting loans should not be deducted from savings; instead, it said savings should be paid gross and loans should be sold on to other providers. The move has been backed by the BBA.WANT TO KNOW MORE?READER COMMENTS (0)No comments have so far been submitted.
