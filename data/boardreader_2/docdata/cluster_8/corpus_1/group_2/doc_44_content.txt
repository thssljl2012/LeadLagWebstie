Gordon Brown heads to Labours conference feeling the pressure from his own party but, as Political Editor Tomos Livingstone reports, the real test will come when he gets back to WestminsterONE THING Gordon Brown wasnt short of as he arrived in Manchester last night was advice.With his party more than 20 points behind in the polls and a gradually growing band of MPs calling for him to step aside, there are plenty of views being offered as to what he should do next.These range from issuing an apology for his uncertain first year in charge, through an about-turn on public sector pay right through to bringing arch-enemies like John Reid and Charles Clarke back into his Cabinet.I suspect that most of those representations will fall on deaf ears, although there is some suggestion his conference speech will contain a hint that things havent gone exactly according to plan so far. Whats more, I suspect that speech was more or less completed on his summer holiday in Suffolk, and little that has happened since then will have caused him to take out the black felt pen and start all over again.The central theme of his speech and the entire Brown survival plan will be the economy: now is not the time to change the captain (and plumping for David Miliband or David Cameron instead) and the choice is between someone who knows what hes doing (himself) and someone who doesnt (everyone else). The takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB strengthens Mr Browns case. It also makes it far more difficult for plotting rebels to lever him out of the hotseat.The conference had threatened to be a bloodbath. I suspect things will be a little more muted, and Mr Brown  and other Ministers  will talk a great deal about unity.Mr Brown will also try to land some punches on Mr Cameron.He has failed to do this so far but the global economic situation gives him the opportunity to pose some legitimate policy questions to his Tory opposite number.The suggestion that he needs to go for the Tories is one piece of advice he may actually listen to.Those inside Downing Street know that one slim chance of winning the next election lies in repeating the trick the Tories themselves pulled off in 1992  making the election about the opposition partys fitness for office rather than the record of the Government.So expect plenty of questions about whether David Cameron would have allowed the HBOS-Lloyds TSB merger, or whether he would build new nuclear power stations.Mr Brown is already talking about the need to restate the case for Labour, an implicit admission that he hasnt been making the case well enough so far. Its a fine strategy but its easier said than done, not least because so many Labour figures think the problem is Mr Brown himself. A poll of Labour supporters suggested 54% wanted someone else in charge. I think a similar proportion of MPs think that way too.Will the small number of rebels to go public so far get a good reception in the conference hall? I doubt it.There might even be some delegates willing to tell them to shut up, egged on by Brownite loyalists.None of which means the Prime Minister is out of the woods. The polls tell their own story, although they may improve a little if his performance on the podium is good.The real test comes on October 6 when MPs get back to Westminster, and see more banana skins in the diary  the Glenrothes by-election, the pre-Budget report, the Queens Speech. If those three things go badly wrong, I think we can guess what advice Labour MPs will have for the beleaguered Prime Minister.
