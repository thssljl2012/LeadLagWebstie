XL said it entered into administration -- U.K. lexicon for bankruptcy -- 'having suffered as a result of volatile fuel prices, the economic downturn, and were unable to obtain further funding.' Barclays reportedly pulled funding in mid-August. XL joins a number of carriers including Silverjet, Maxjet and Oasis Hong Kong Airlines that have gone under. XL was mostly held by the Icelandic businessman Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, who also owns the British soccer club West Ham United. West Ham's jerseys prominently advertise XL. Reports from U.K. media were that 85,000 travelers were left stranded. A flight from London Gatwick to Orlando was cancelled as the plane moved down the runway, The Daily Telegraph reported. Those who didn't book through a travel agent won't get a refund, and the firm's fleet of 21 aircraft was grounded. XL's French and German airlines are not affected by the move. Those that jointly purchased holidays and flights are protected under a British insurance plan, the Air Travel Organizers Licensing scheme. The move drove up the value of rival operators in the U.K., with shares of Tui Travel (UK:TT: news, chart, profile) up 6% and Thomas Cook (UK:TCG: news, chart, profile) up 7.2%. Separately, British Airways (UK:BAY: news, chart, profile) said it's offering voluntary redundancy packages to 1,400 middle managers as part of a plan to cut costs. The airline hasn't been able to fully benefit from the drop in oil prices, which trade in U.S. dollars, because the British pound has dropped markedly against the greenback. LONDON (MarketWatch) -- British tour operator XL Leisure went into bankruptcy on Friday, the latest firm to suffer from a run-up in energy prices and a struggling economy.
