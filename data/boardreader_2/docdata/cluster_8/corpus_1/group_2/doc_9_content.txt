AS airlines crash and banks disappear, here is my simple guide to help you ride out the financial storm.Your savings up to a limit of 35,000 PER INDIVIDUAL, are protected if a bank or building society goes bust under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Spread your money around different banks if you have more than this.Remember, 35,000 is the limit any bank group is responsible for so that's your lot if you spread your cash over the combined Bank of Scotland-Halifax-Lloyds TSB group or Royal Bank of Scotland-NatWest. But if you move money about, you may lose interest.When buying big ticket items, always pay by credit card. You are covered under the Consumer Credit Act for purchases from 100 to 30,000. If any firm goes bust or the items are faulty you can claim your cash back from your credit card firm. This applies even if you pay only a deposit on your credit card.A debit card offers partial protection but only if it is a Visa debit card. You can claim if goods are damaged or undelivered but it is not legally binding, so you can't challenge the firm in court if you don't get your money. You have 120 days to make a claim.If you book a package holiday, use an ABTA-bonded travel agent. If you are abroad and your airline goes bust, as happened with thousands of Zoom and XL passengers, you will get home at no extra cost. Likewise, look for the ATOL sign if booking flights.You are taking a risk if you buy flights and accommodation from different suppliers. You would get your cash back from your credit card firm but could have to make your own way home.Mortgage protection insurance or an income protection policy are worth considering in case you lose your job. But read the small print so you know the exclusions - or you might not get a penny.
