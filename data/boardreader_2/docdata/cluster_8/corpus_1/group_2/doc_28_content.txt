BANKING in Bretton has undergone a radical overhaul  thanks to Lloyds TSB's new state-of-the-art branch.The bank, in British Court, has had a complete refurbishment following a 120,000 cash injection, and the biggest talking point has been the absence of glass screens.The idea is to enable customers to talk more easily to staff and means Lloyds TSB is the first major bank in the UK to remove all the glass screens in most of its branches.Long-serving employee Karen Spence, who joined the company in 1989, said; 'Lloyds TSB has had a branch in the area for more than 19 years and the new design unveiled today brings us bang up to date.'We'd like to say a big thank-you to all of our customers for putting up with the disruption during the refurbishment works.'Like all of us, I know they'll agree it's been well worth the wait.'Peterborough's own Beijing bronze medallist gymnast Louis Smith and young local rower Natalie Bream were guests of honour as they cut the ribbon to declare the new branch officially open and allow the first eager customers in.Olympian Louis is now famous across the city thanks to his Olympic exploits and Natalie is one of the Lloyds TSB Local Heroes  a scheme which provides funding to 250 emerging young sportspeople across Britain each year in the run up 2012 and beyond.Branch manager Tina Brewster explained the firm had wanted to become a more inviting place and move with the times, and believes it has delivered that concept.She said: 'My first reaction to our new branch was quite simply, 'wow'.'We've really broken down the barriers to give our customers a much more personal experience and we're sure they're going to appreciate the changes.'It's an honour to have Louis and Natalie here to celebrate the opening and we wish them the best of luck as they continue on their sporting journey towards 2012.'Among the many changes to be introduced is the arrival of in-store radio and TV to help customers relax and be entertained.
