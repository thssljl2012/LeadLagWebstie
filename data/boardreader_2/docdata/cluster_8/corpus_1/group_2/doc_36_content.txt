Warnings have gone out to bank customers in Bahrain to change their ATM and debit card personal identification (PIN) numbers, following widespread fraud in the UAE.Citibank, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, National Bank of Abu Dhabi and Emirates NBD have been hit by the scam, in which hackers have been cloning cards to raid accounts, after stealing personal information.Bahrain Society of Bankers chief executive officer Robert Ainey said he had not received any similar reports in Bahrain, but people should change their PINs regularly.'While we have had no such reports in Bahrain and we have not been advised on any alert by the Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB), it would not be out of place to suggest that, at this point in time, people should change their PIN,' he said.Ainey said it was advisable for customers to change their PIN every few months anyway, so a change in PIN should not be a panic reaction.'This is just one of the security measures that we have always tried to tell people to follow,' he said. 'The current spate of hackings in the UAE should act as a facilitator.'Ainey also said many people were in the habit of keeping their PIN written on a piece of paper along with their bank cards.'If they lose their card, they also lose their PIN and anyone who finds it can get easy access to their cash. We keep telling the people to desist from such practices,' said Ainey.A Citibank official told the Gulf Daily News, our sister publication, that he was aware of the UAE problems but had not heard of anything like that in Bahrain.'The ATM and debit card use in Bahrain goes on as usual. However, we would still advice customers to change their PIN. This should be done every few weeks in any case,' said the official.Officials from HSBC and the CBB were not available to comment.Earlier reports said it is unclear how many customer accounts had been hit by the fraud in the UAE or how much money had been lost.Following the scam, most banks in the UAE have started advising customers to change their PIN as a precaution.Preliminary investigation suggests that hackers may have got their hands on card details and PINs after rigging cash machines with card skimmers.-TradeArabia News Service
