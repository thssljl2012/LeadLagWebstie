SECURITY measures have been questioned after bank staff sent out a 5,000 limit credit card with PIN number to the wrong person. Leanne Wright was stunned when she opened a letter addressed to her home in Oxford Street, Rugby to find the card with someone else's name on it.She was then even more amazed when the PIN number came through the post days later.She has since handed the card back to Barclays Bank - but said that a less honest person could have had a spending spree on someone else's credit card.'I just could not believe it,' said Leanne.'When we get mail through the post with someone else's name on it, we usually return it to sender.'But on this occasion I didn't realise it had a different name and I opened it.'Inside I found a credit card and then days later the pin number arrived.'I just thought 'Oh my God' and was in complete shock. I could have walked away with all that person's money but luckily we are honest people.'The card was a Morgan Stanley replacement card with a 5,000 limit.Barclays Bank told the Advertiser that it would not discuss its fraud prevention and security measures but did say that it monitors all transactions and 'will react if we observe unusual activity taking place'.In a statement, the bank added: 'We offer a 100 per cent guarantee to our customers that they will not be liable for any fraud on their card as long as they take due care with their personal information.'Talking about Leanne's case, the statement added: 'The company is reliant upon customers informing us when they move house or, as a back-up, letters being returned by the new resident once the customer has moved.'Neither of these things happened in this case.'
