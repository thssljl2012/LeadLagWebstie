MIDDLESBROUGH teenage modern pentathlete Bradley Dixon insists his selection for the Lloyds TSB Local Heroes scheme is already enhancing his dream of emulating Olympic silver medallist Heather Fell at London 2012.The 17-year-old is one of 250 emerging Brits who will receive 1,000 each year in the run up to London 2012  plugging a financial gap as Dixon is yet to achieve World Class lottery funding.The Bede College pupil will also benefit from the know how of Lloyds TSB local hero mentors, including former Olympic triple-jump champion Jonathan Edwards.And after watching fellow Brit Fell claim silver in Beijing, as Team GB finished fourth on the medal table with 19 golds  their most successful Games in a century  Dixon is already aiming to follow Fells footsteps.The funding has been a real godsend because there are five different events and so I essentially need five sets of equipment, said Bradley.Some of it can be really expensive and up until the grant I had to borrow quite an old gun which has been hindering my performances quite a bit.But now Ive been able to buy a brand new gun and I can really feel the difference and its having an excellent impact on my pentathlon.I was really impressed with Britains successes at the Beijing Olympics and it was fantastic to see Heather Fell getting onto the podium.The Sedgefield Harrier is highly regarded in modern pentathlon circles and underlined his growing reputation with a 14th place finish at last years European Youth Championships.And former Olympic and World Champion Edwards, who still holds the triple jump world record, is predicting a golden future for Dixon.There is a lot of money in sport now through the lottery but Bradley is not quite good enough just yet to take advantage, said Edwards.He still makes a huge commitment in time and money in order to do what he does and he doesnt get a lot back. This relieves a bit of pressure and gives him a boost.Sport can be lonely so when someone comes along and believes in you enough to give you 1,000 it makes you realise you will make it after all.Lloyds TSB is providing up to 1,000 to 250 emerging young sportspeople identified each year across Britain, in the run up to London 2012 and beyond.
