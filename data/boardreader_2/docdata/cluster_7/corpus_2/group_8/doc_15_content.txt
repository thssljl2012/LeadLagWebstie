According to official data published overnight, 6.7 per cent of the American workforce is now out of a job.       Australian job figures released yesterday showed a slight rise to 4.4 per cent.      Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, described the data as "awful". He said: "It is very clear that the underlying trend is still rocketing as companies throw in the towel and prepare for a long, deep recession."       The 573,000 figure does not take into account workers who may have lost one job but found another.       Overall, according to the Department of Labour Statistics, about 240,000 people are being thrown out of work each month.       The rapidly rising rate represents a big challenge for Barack Obama, who takes office on January 20. He has promised to try to stem the surge in joblessness by investing more than $US500 billion in public infrastructure projects such as road building to spur job creation in the construction, engineering, and design sectors. The policy echoes the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s.       As a sign of the deepening recession, Stanley Works, the construction services and tools group, which owns the Stanley Knife brand, said that it is to sack 2000 staff - 10 per cent of its workforce.      Separately, the trade deficit in October rose to $US57.2 billion, well above expectations of $US53.5 billion. It reflects an increase in oil imports, which had been expected to fall in line with petrol prices.       In a sign that the spending habits of Americans are shifting, household debt fell for the first time, based on data going back to 1952. According to the Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds report, consumer debt fell by an annualised $US30 billion, or 0.8 per cent in the third quarter, to $US13.91 trillion.       The net worth of Americans declined by $US2.8 trillion, or 4.7 per cent, in the third quarter, dragged down by precipitous declines in property values and the stock market. The net worth of households fell to $US56.5 trillion at the end of September, according to the report.
