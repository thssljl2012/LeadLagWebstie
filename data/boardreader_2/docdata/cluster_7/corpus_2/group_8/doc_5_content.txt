(ii) It takes time for the banks to re-lend deposits........  it's happening every minute they are open!   (iii) People have to be willing to borrow (and if most people are looking to pay down debt then there is no economic stimulus).  What about new home buyers? Lower interest rates are also encouraging people to borrow.      The other problem the Government faces is it won't have much surplus left after this expenditure, and may even push the budget into deficit.                       Nothing wrong with ANZ Economics comment but your conclusions are far too narrow and not realistic. For example, a first home buyer can utilise both the FHOG and borrowings(pool of which has been added to by loan repayments).
