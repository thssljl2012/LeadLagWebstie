   Retail sales held up better than expected in January, as consumers shopped for after-Christmas bargains despite rising fears for job security. Trade data also out today were better than tipped by analysts.    Monthly retail sales gained 0.2%, seasonally adjusted, in January to a record total of $19.2 billion from an increase of 3.8% in December, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. Analysts expected them to decline 0.5%.     http://business.theage.com.au/business/retail-sales-in-surprise-pickup-20090303-8mun.html     Australia's trade position added a huge 1.5 percentage points to gross domestic product (GDP) last quarter, countering a drag from falling inventories and pointing to a positive reading for GDP.             Other data out on Tuesday showed retail sales unexpectedly rose in January thanks to the lingering boost from government hand-outs, suggesting fiscal and monetary stimulus was helping support consumption.    The Reserve Bank of Australia will announce its decision on interest rates later today.  Australia reported a seasonally adjusted current account deficit of $6.499 billion in the December quarter from a revised deficit of $9.498 billion in the September quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said on Tuesday.     http://business.theage.com.au/business/exports-give-boost-to-gdp-20090303-8mv2.html
