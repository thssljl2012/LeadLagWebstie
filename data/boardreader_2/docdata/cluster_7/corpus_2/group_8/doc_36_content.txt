So that's a $60 billion turnaround in the first two years of the Rudd govt?           Quote:                         $40b budget deficit looms   Chris Zappone   January 27, 2009 - 3:13PM      A weaker economy, more industry bailouts and a huge stimulus spend are likely to push the Federal budget into a $40 billion deficit next financial year, the National Australia Bank says.      A 2009-10 budget blow-out, spelling a dramatic reversal of Australia's run of surpluses, would arise due to a weaker economy and the need for more economic rescue packages, NAB economist Jeff Oughton said today.      The self-described "bearish'' prediction emerged in the bank's latest business confidence survey, which showed December posting the twelfth consecutive month of negative sentiment.      "We have allowed for a substantial increase in government spending - of the order of over $15 billion per annum,'' Mr Oughton said.      "[It] allows for cyclical deterioration from a weaker economy as well as a big increase in economic rescue packages.''      He said the Federal Government was likely to spend another $15 billion on new home buyers' grants, further packages for pensions and tax cuts.      The deficit forecast by NAB is nearly four times larger than the $10.4 billion stimulus package announced in October.      In addition to the stimulus package, the Federal Government has offered a special fund for the car industry, and announced a $4 billion Australian Business Investment Partnership to keep the commercial property industry running if foreign banks stop writing new loans....         The expectation of a budget blow-out in 2009-10 coincides with a grim assessment for business confidence.      The NAB said its business confidence survey figures firmed to minus 20 points in December, but this was from a record low of minus 29.9 in November.      GDP to shrink      Meanwhile, NAB lowered its gross domestic product growth forecast for 2009 to minus-0.25% from a previously expected 0.5% gain. It dropped its forecast for 2010 to a 1% increase from an earlier prediction of 1.75%.      Weaker growth means a higher jobless rate, costing the Government more money in unemployment benefits.      Unemployment is expected to rise as high as 9% in 2010 from its current level of 4.5%, as companies with slumping business levels shed jobs.                      http://business.smh.com.au/business/...0127-7qmx.html
