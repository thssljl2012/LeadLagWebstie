The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, that banks charge each other for such loans dropped 3 basis points to 4.96 percent today, the British Bankers&amp;amp;#039; Association said. That&amp;amp;#039;s the lowest level since Sept. 12, the Friday before Lehman failed. The overnight dollar rate slid 23 basis points to 1.28 percent, below the Federal Reserve&amp;amp;#039;s target for the first time since Oct. 3.  ``The initiatives that governments have taken are beginning to work,&amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039; said Laurence Mutkin, the London-based head of European fixed-income strategy at Morgan Stanley. ``We&amp;amp;#039;re seeing a lot of improvement.&amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039;  Governments worldwide have introduced measures to shore up bank balance sheets after money markets seized up following the Lehman bankruptcy on Sept. 15. The French government will inject 10.5 billion euros ($14 billion) into BNP Paribas SA, Societe Generale SA and four other domestic banks as they tap for the first time the 360 billion-euro rescue package unveiled this month.  Interbank rates have tumbled in the past week after policy makers in Europe offered lenders unlimited dollar funding. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England today made available as much U.S. currency as required. The ECB allotted $101.93 billion of 28-day cash at a fixed rate of 2.11 percent, while U.K. policy makers loaned $26 billion. The Libor-OIS spread, a measure of cash liquidity, stayed below 300 basis points for a second day.  Treasury Bills  Treasury three-month bills fell for a fourth day, the longest sequence of declines in 10 weeks, as investor appetite for the safest assets dwindled.  The three-month dollar Libor slid 23 basis points to 3.83 percent today. That&amp;amp;#039;s still 233 basis points more than the Fed&amp;amp;#039;s target rate for overnight loans of 1.5 percent, up from 120 basis points about a month ago. At the start of the year, the spread was 43 basis points. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  ``We see a slight improvement on the interbank market, but no breakthrough yet,&amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039; European Central Bank Executive Board member Juergen Stark said in an interview with German radio station Deutschlandfunk. ``There&amp;amp;#039;s a high risk that we&amp;amp;#039;ll see another incident&amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039; in the banking sector.  The Libor is used to determine rates on $360 trillion of financial products worldwide, from mortgages to company loans and derivatives.  French Funding  The French government will subscribe to subordinated debt issued by the country&amp;amp;#039;s six biggest banks, without acquiring voting rights, Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris yesterday. In exchange, the banks will have to boost lending to companies and households, she said.  The decline in U.S. bills pushed yields to the highest level in almost a month on speculation concerted global action will ease the turmoil in the credit markets. The cost of protecting European and Asian corporate bonds from default dropped as appetite for higher-yielding assets increased.  ``There&amp;amp;#039;s plenty of cash on the table and there&amp;amp;#039;s plenty of money coming into the banking sector,&amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039; said David Keeble, head of fixed-income strategy in London at Calyon, the investment-banking arm of Credit Agricole SA. ``What we&amp;amp;#039;re finding is that confidence has been improving.&amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039;  Hong Kong Rate  The three-month interbank lending rate for Hong Kong dollars, or Hibor, dropped for a third day, sliding 31 basis points to 3.35 percent, its longest run of declines in more than a month. Singapore&amp;amp;#039;s three-month rate for U.S. dollar loans slid for a sixth day, to 3.92 percent.  Australian banks&amp;amp;#039; borrowing costs climbed for the first time in four days as financial institutions increased deposits at the central bank to a record. The rate banks charge each other for three-month loans rose to 5.87 percent, the highest since Oct. 15. Bank deposits at the Reserve Bank of Australia grew to a record A$11.2 billion ($7.7 billion) yesterday, up by A$306 million.  ``The funding situation is still fragile and we&amp;amp;#039;ve seen evidence of that today,&amp;amp;#039;&amp;amp;#039; said Adam Carr, a senior economist at ICAP Australia Ltd. in Sydney.
