(jk :-)   &amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt;   &amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; I am not sure what you mean here.   &amp;amp;gt;      &amp;amp;gt; Two things:   &amp;amp;gt;    &amp;amp;gt; The poster I was responding to is apparently in Australia.   &amp;amp;gt;    &amp;amp;gt; Americans are hopeless with geography.  The only way most americans   &amp;amp;gt; learn where other countries are is when we invade them.  Be thankful   &amp;amp;gt; we don&amp;#039;t know where Australia is.   &amp;amp;gt;      &amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; In Australia we are indeed lucky, we will not feel the economic   &amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; tsunami that you guys in US and Europe are experiencing.   &amp;amp;gt;      &amp;amp;gt; Don&amp;#039;t be so sure.         According to many economists the impact will be less here.   &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; Theres   &amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; really only one reason why were in a resources boom: Australia has   &amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; iron ore  lots of it too  and China is buying it just as quickly as   &amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; were digging it out of the ground.   &amp;amp;gt;      &amp;amp;gt; Canada is also resource rich (oil, iron, gold, uranium, etc).  It&amp;#039;s   &amp;amp;gt; doing better than the US and Europe, but it will be dragged down too.   &amp;amp;gt;      &amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; Western Australia is the motor of the Australian economy because of   &amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; our iron ore and economic growth is now estimated at 7 per cent, an   &amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; increase of 2.5 per cent on the forecast delivered in the last State   &amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; Budget.   &amp;amp;gt;      &amp;amp;gt; Lets say that Americans and Europeans are suddenly feeling poor.   &amp;amp;gt; They stop buying so much stuff.  China won&amp;#039;t produce as much, so it   &amp;amp;gt; won&amp;#039;t need as much iron.          We are aware of that already, that&amp;#039;s what I said there will be some collateral effects and surely some slow down in our economy,  but we won&amp;#039;t be facing that brutal effect that you guys are experiencing.   In the US, taxpayers are bailing out the banks and Japanese finance is stalking fallen US banks, but here the Commonwealth Bank is planning  to buy BankWest, the Australian arm of HBOS, in a deal estimated to be worth $2 billion.           &amp;amp;nbsp;    &amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;gt; The state and the federal budgets are both in surplus.   &amp;amp;gt;      &amp;amp;gt; Australia is in fantastic shape wrt public debt.   &amp;amp;gt;    &amp;amp;gt; --   &amp;amp;gt; Seen in a fortune cookie:   &amp;amp;gt; Fear is the darkroom where negatives are developed
