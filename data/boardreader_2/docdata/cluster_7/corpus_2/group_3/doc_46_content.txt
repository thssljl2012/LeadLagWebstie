SYDNEY, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Australia&amp;#039;s central bank leant $10 billion in a second U.S. dollar repurchase auction on Thursday, as part of a global effort by central banks to meet desperate demand for the U.S. currency in a frozen money market.    The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said the 95-day repo went at an average yield of 3.487 percent. The longer terms of the auction were aimed at helping banks meet year-end funding needs.    This was only the second RBA repo of U.S. dollars after it and a number of other central banks set up U.S. dollar swap lines with the Federal Reserve. The facilities are aimed at meeting strong demand for U.S. dollars during Asian trading hours.    (Reporting by Wayne Cole)    .    ng    COPYRIGHT    Copyright Thomson Financial News Limited 2008.
