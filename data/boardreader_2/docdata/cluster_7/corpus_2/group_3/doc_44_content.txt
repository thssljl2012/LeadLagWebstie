SYDNEY, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp, Australia&amp;#039;s fourth-largest bank, on Tuesday said it would cut its standard variable home loan rate by 80 basis points to 8.56 percent.    Earlier in the day, the Reserve Bank of Australia cut the official cash rate by a surprisingly large 1 percent to 6.0 percent. National Australia Bank, the country&amp;#039;s largest lender, said it would wait till markets calmed down before deciding on any cuts.
