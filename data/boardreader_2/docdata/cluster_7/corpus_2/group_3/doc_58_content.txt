Australian Newly Built Home Sales Fall Accelerated in September      By Jacob Greber      Oct. 31 (Bloomberg) -- Australian sales of newly built homes  declined in September at a faster pace even after the central bank  cut borrowing costs for the first time since 2001.      Sales of homes fell 1.8 percent from August when they declined 1.3  percent, the sixth drop in nine months, the Housing Industry  Association said in a report e-mailed to Bloomberg News today.  Detached house sales declined 2.3 percent, the eighth straight  month of falls, and sales of apartments gained 1.2 percent.      The Reserve Bank of Australia&amp;#039;s quarter-point reduction in the  benchmark interest rate in early September ``did little to turn  around weak sentiment and the negative impact of higher rates over  2007 and 2008,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Harley Dale, chief economist at the  Canberra-based association, which represents building  companies.      ``The clear signal from leading housing indicators is that new home  building activity will be weakening into 2009,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.  ``However, we would expect to see a modest recovery in housing  starts emerge over the first half of 2009.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;      Central bank governor Glenn Stevens and his board also cut the  benchmark rate by 1 percentage point to 6 percent this month, the  biggest reduction since 1992, and will probably reduce it by half a  point next week, according to a Bloomberg news survey of  economists.      ``There is cause for optimism that the worst may be behind us,&amp;#039;&amp;#039;  Dale said.
