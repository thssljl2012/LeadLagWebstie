 Heres the latest article       Australia &amp;#039;will be in a recession by Christmas&amp;#039;       AUSTRALIA will be in a recession by Christmas but a rash of interest rate cuts will allow the economy to recover fast, Goldman Sachs JBWere says.    Chief economist Tim Toohey told ABC-TV a very weak June quarter will not be bettered by September economic figures, which are likely to show the economy is deteriorating.      A recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth.      &amp;amp;quot;We think it&amp;#039;s quite likely that by the time Christmas rolls around, Australia will be in its first recession since this expansion began 17 years ago,&amp;amp;quot; Mr Toohey said.      &amp;amp;quot;The fall in the Australian dollar that we&amp;#039;ve already seen over the last six to eight weeks is equivalent to around about another five rate cuts by the way we do the calculations.&amp;amp;quot;      He said every 2.5 per cent cut in the trade weighted index equalled one rate cut and the official cash rate would fall to 4.5 per cent by March and most will be passed on to mortgage holders.      The fragile state of the global economy will be revealed this week as key economic growth figures are released in Australia and overseas.      The local share market is expected to open 20 points lower this morning after a lacklustre showing on Wall Street on Friday night with volatility expected to continue.      Investors on Tuesday will get a clearer picture on future interest rate cuts.      The Reserve Bank of Australia board will release minutes of its October meeting, where it spectacularly slashed 100 basis points of the official cash rate.      Governor Glenn Stevens also is addressing the America Chamber of Commerce in Australia      Economists are tipping a cut of at least 50 basis points on Melbourne Cup Day to bring official rates to 5.5 per cent.       &amp;amp;quot;I think the RBA will try to get rates below 5 per cent fairly quickly - it could be as much as 75 basis points cut in November and then the remainder in December,&amp;amp;quot; Commsec chief equities economist Craig James said.      &amp;amp;quot;So I think by Christmas we&amp;#039;ll see a cash rate of around about 5 per cent or a little bit below.&amp;amp;quot;      The Commonwealth Bank expects rates to reach 5 per cent in March.      Harvey Norman chairman Gerry Harvey yesterday said he expected rates to be as low as 3 per cent in the near future and the retailer, which has stores in every town in Australia with more than 10,000 people, now is releasing sales figures every Tuesday.      Retailers generally release sales figures quarterly.      &amp;amp;quot;If there&amp;#039;s a mechanism that can produce what&amp;#039;s happening out there in the marketplace at the moment ... If we put those figures every week, we&amp;#039;ll give you an indication of what&amp;#039;s happening in the marketplace now,&amp;amp;quot; Mr Harvey told Ten Network.      &amp;amp;quot;The ($10 billion Federal Government spending package) will help, but look, there&amp;#039;s a big picture out there - there&amp;#039;s a world crisis and regardless of whether you give $10 billion back or not, it&amp;#039;s not really going to solve the problem.&amp;amp;quot;      He said there had not been any increases in the number of customers defaulting on loans.      Richard Goyder, the boss of Coles owner Wesfarmers, said demand had been stable in its supermarkets but discount department stores Target and K mart were starting to feel the flow on from consumers starting to hoard their cash.      Rival Woolworths reports first-quarter sales on Tuesday. China&amp;#039;s gross domestic product figures are expected out on Tuesday as well.
