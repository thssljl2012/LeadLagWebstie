Dear All,     1.The SMH Newspapers has reported this morning that  &amp;amp;quot;The Reserve Bank of Australia is forecasting economic growth to slow to 1.5 per cent for 2008 from 4.2 per cent last year.&amp;amp;quot;      http://news.smh.com.au/business/bank...1024-588v.html       2. The RBA&amp;#039;s previous growth forecast was 2.25% for 2008.    3. Consequently, it seems that the Australian Economy, has recently ( after the March 2008 Interest Rate Increase Implementation)  been rapidly slowing down.  It has indeed been slowing down faster than required for a planned soft landing by the Australian Economy, as previously envisaged or/and engineered by the RBA.    4. Hence the  recent 0.25% Interest Rate cut in September 2008 and a further 1% Official  Interest Rate Cut in October 2008.    5.  In view of the present rapidly slowing down Australian Economy and the wider global financial crisis continuing to unfold itself further,  we can expect the RBA to further cut  its Official Interest Rate again in November 2008, as well as probably in December 2008 again.    6. The local financial markets is said to be presently factoring a 0.5%-0.75%pa. Official Interest Rate cut by the RBA,  in November 2008.    7. This is not withstanding that the local inflation has  recently reached its record high  at about 5.0% pa.    8. Will the Australian economy likely to fall into a Recession by this December 2008 or/and by early 2009, as previously been projected by some market analysts?    9.  For your further comments and discussion, please.    10. Thank you    regards,  Kenneth KOH
