History shows  that people are more like to save/be very cautious with their money in such times.        Recent research  shows that the majority receiving the handout will save it. It is therefore unlikely that mortgage holders will splurge what they save from reduced interest rates, particularly as confidence will be falling further as unemployment climbs in 2009.                      Vague and unspecific as always Drot         What about this morning&amp;#039;s announcement?            Quote:                            Consumer confidence in Australia took a turn for the better in November  , according to survey results released on Wednesday.         The Consumer Confidence Index   released by Westpac Bank and the Melbourne Institute,   showed consumer sentiment increased by 4.3 percent or 3.5 points from October&amp;#039;s levels   to a reading of 85.5. In October, the index fell 11 percent. The November 2008 reading remains 22.6 percent lower than its level of one year earlier.         &amp;amp;quot;This is a welcome result,&amp;amp;quot; said Westpac Chief Economist Bill Evans.   There has been great uncertainty as to how consumers would react to the barrage of news over the last month.&amp;amp;quot;       The &amp;amp;quot;news&amp;amp;quot; included an unexpectedly large 75 basis point reduction in   cash interest rates by the Reserve Bank of Australia, taking the rate to 5.25 percent, a three-year low.   Also in the consumer survey, the index of family finances fell 7.8 percent on year, while the index for the coming year was lower by 0.1 percent.                       http://www.nasdaq.com/aspxcontent/Ne...ourne%20Survey
