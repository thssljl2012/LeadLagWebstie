 I nearly fell off my chair laughing when I saw the title of today&amp;#039;s announcement by NAB.                                                Quote:                   NAB to strengthen further its capital position                                                 The fact is NAB needs this capital to cushion the writeoffs coming down the pike. Assuming a 20$ issue price NAB will be issuing 150 million shares, a 9% dilution to existing shareholders, yeah that is something to happy about.
