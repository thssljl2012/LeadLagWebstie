Check out ANZ Japan... it&amp;#039;s an Australian bank inside Japan so might be able to fix you up.    My call... right now&amp;#039;s a good time to be doing such things (if you can), you&amp;#039;ll have the advantage of low interest rates, and you&amp;#039;ll be sending yen back to Australia (where the dollar&amp;#039;s currently really low).    Your only problem is going to be when the dollar rises, you&amp;#039;ll still be dealing with yen so the cost of your loan will go up significantly. Also; I don&amp;#039;t think Japan&amp;#039;s rates can stay low forever. Right now like America they&amp;#039;re just... too low... there&amp;#039;s no room for them to go down. I have a feeling they might blow up soon along with the Japanese yen.
