because they know it&amp;#039;s just a blip on the radar - remember most folk on here would qualify for a 0.7% discount with CBA - which would make 15year rates about 7.2% currently.      minus any drop in Dec and poss Feb/Mar, you could see as low as 6% fixed for 10 or 15 years - depending on how the banks pass it on i guess.
