By Anirban Nag and Gyles Beckford    SYDNEY/WELLINGTON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Australia&amp;#039;s economic growth is likely to slow next year, while unemployment is set to to jump, dented by the fallout from the financial crisis and a darkening outlook for the world economy, the OECD said.    The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, whose 30 members are mostly high-income countries, said in its biannual economic outlook released on Tuesday that New Zealand&amp;#039;s economy would remain in recession next year before lower interest rates, increased government spending and higher exports help to stimulate gross domestic product growth.    &amp;#039;Australia&amp;#039;s GDP growth could well weaken from 2.5 percent in 2008 to around 1.75 percent in 2009 before picking up to 2.75 percent in 2010,&amp;#039; the OECD said.    &amp;#039;The international financial crisis and the delayed impact of the restrictive monetary policy in place up to the third-quarter of 2008 should contribute to keeping growth fairly sluggish until mid-2009.&amp;#039;    It echoed the views of Australia&amp;#039;s central bank, which earlier this month cut its forecasts for GDP growth in 2009 to 1.75 percent, from 2.5 percent estimated a few months earlier. The country grew at 2.7 percent in the year to June 2008.    The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has already slashed the cash rate by 200 basis points between September and November, taking it to 5.25 percent. The federal government has also announced a $10.4 billion ($6.7 billion) pre-Christmas stimulus package to help struggling households and pensioners.    The OECD expects the slowdown to push up the jobless rate to 6 percent while sluggish domestic demand and falling oil prices would combine to tame inflation.    Australia&amp;#039;s consumer price index climbed to 5 percent last quarter, well above the central bank&amp;#039;s 2-3 percent target range.    For New Zealand, the OECD forecast GDP growth at 0.5 percent in 2008, cut by a third from its June report, and then contracting by 0.3 percent in 2009, slashed from a previous forecast of 2.1 percent growth.    Inflation was seen at 4 percent in 2008, slowing to 2.3 percent in 2009. Inflation hit an 18-year high of 5.1 percent in the year to Sept. 30.    &amp;#039;Despite a near-term boost from tax cuts and a bounce back from drought, only modest macroeconomic improvement is projected until mid-2010,&amp;#039; the report said.    It noted the year has so far seen a sharply slowing housing market, job losses, and a large current account deficit, which will take time to be resolved.    The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has cut rates by a total of 175 basis points since July to help the economy and is expected to cut by at least a further 100 basis points to 5.5 percent at its Dec. 4 monetary policy statement.
