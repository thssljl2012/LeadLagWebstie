You could break your existing fixed rate and refix for a longer term.  This might be costly at this point (only the CBA can tell you that).  It might save you long term, it might not.      The CBA also allows you to make $5k extra repayments every year on a fixed rate.  The best thing you can do to reduce risk in the future is to reduce debt.
