 Allison Jackson   November 04, 2008          THE Reserve Bank has left the door open to further aggressive interest rate cuts after reducing borrowing costs to the lowest level in more than five years.       RBA paves way for hefty rates cuts       The RBA reduced the official cash rate by 75 basis points to 5.25 per cent, from 6 per cent, a deeper cut than expected by financial markets that had bet on a more modest 50-point drop.      Underscoring the central banks concern about the deteriorating domestic and global economic outlook, the rate is now at its lowest since December 2003.      The move marked the third reduction in as many months, adding to the 100-basis-point cut in October - the biggest lowering since May 1992 - and the quarter-point reduction in September, for the most aggressive rate-cut cycle in 25 years, in percentage terms.      RBA governor Glenn Stevens said deteriorating global economic conditions and falling commodity prices justified the larger-than-expected reduction.      He warned that the economy would likely be weaker than had earlier been expected.      Recent reductions in borrowing rates, the depreciation of the exchange rate and the fiscal stimulus announced in October will work to assist growth in the period ahead, but deteriorating international conditions and falling commodity prices will have a dampening influence, said Mr Stevens in a statement that accompanied the rate cut.      Economists noted that Mr Stevens did not make any reference to the 100-basis-point cut in October.      At the time, he said that the board does not regard that movement as establishing a pattern for future decisions.      ICAP senior economist Adam Carr said the omission showed that the RBA had changed its mind.      Their past statements suggested they didnt want the market to think that 100 basis points would be the basis of future moves. Clearly, they have changed their mind on that, said Mr Carr.      What they have done in this statement is downgrade their growth forecasts and make a clear statement to suggest they are more worried about downside risks to growth than they are about inflation.      The door is open for further aggressive cuts, and a 4 per cent cash rate by mid next year cant be ruled out.      Commonwealth Bank responded immediately to the RBA move by cutting its variable homeloan rate by 58 basis points, to 7.74 per cent.      The Australian dollar fell to US66.18c after the announcement, from US67.15c.      The sharemarket rallied more than 1 per cent to trade in positive territory for the first time all day after the RBA announcement.      Financial markets were pricing another 75-basis-point cut next month and a further quarter-point reduction in early 2009, according to Credit Suisse analysts.      CommSec chief equities economist Craig James said the rate cut marked the most aggressive rate-cut cycle since the Australian dollar was floated in 1983.      On inflation, Mr Stevens said easing capacity pressures and slowing demand would see inflation start to fall soon, though the weaker Australian dollar could delay inflation reaching the central banks target range of 2-3 per cent.      Global disinflationary forces will assist in this regard, though the depreciation of the exchange rate means that the decline of inflation to the target could take longer than would otherwise be the case, said Mr Stevens      He said the board was willing to make further adjustments to interest rates to promote sustainable growth consistent with achieving the 2-3 per cent inflation target over time.      UBS economists Scott Haslem and George Tharenou said they expected to see the RBA board reduce rates again at its December meeting, possibly by 50 basis points, as it tries to move rates into a neutral position as quickly as possible.      Given the extent of the change in the outlook for growth, the RBA is likely to see getting back to neutral as its first and urgent priority, regardless of current inflation prints, they both said.      With neutral likely to be no more than 5 per cent for the cash rate, we still expect a further 50-basis-point cut from the RBA at their December meeting, though this is under review, given today&amp;#039;s larger than forecast cut.      Treasurer Wayne Swan welcomed the rate cut as a win for homeowners and businesses.      &amp;amp;quot;For families, once the rate cut is passed on, it saves around $150 a month for someone with a $300,000 mortgage. In total, the rate cuts since September will deliver around $400 in relief per month, for someone with a $300,000 mortgage,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.      &amp;amp;quot;This is the additional rate relief Australian families and businesses need in the face of the global financial crisis. It will strengthen our economy at a vital time.&amp;amp;quot;      Expectations for an aggressive move intensified yesterday after the release of much worse than expected statistical findings on house prices, retail sales, manufacturing output and job ads.      House prices had their biggest quarterly drop in 30 years, retail sales recorded the biggest fall in 3 years, manufacturing output dropped to recession levels and job ads fell by the most in 10 years.      Central banks around the world have been cutting interest rates in a desperate effort to stimulate economic growth and prevent a global recession.      World financial markets have remained turbulent over the past month, Mr Stevens said.      Monetary authorities in the US, China, India, South Korea and Japan have all cut official rates in the past week.      The European Central Bank and Bank of England are expected to follow suit when they meet later this week.       THE AUSTRALIAN
