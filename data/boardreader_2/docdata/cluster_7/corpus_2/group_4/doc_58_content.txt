Hi PT_Bear,      I did ask about CBA about the break cost and I am looking at over $20K at this stage for both loans combined.       I saw a post by keithj who did a break on his fixed loan about 6 weeks ago :           Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  keithj                         Yes - timing is everything.

If I had known about that then I would definitely would have broke my loan then but now I have missed the boat.       However I just want to be prepared for future to make sure if the rates go up then whether I can extend the fixed loan term with very minimum cost involved.       Thanks.
