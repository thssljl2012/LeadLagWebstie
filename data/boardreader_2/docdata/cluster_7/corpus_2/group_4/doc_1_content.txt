TOKYO, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Japan&amp;#039;s economy shrank 0.1 percent in the third quarter, sending the world&amp;#039;s second-biggest economy into recession for the first time in seven years and lagging market expectations for anaemic 0.1 percent growth.    Weak exports are taking their toll on Japan&amp;#039;s economy, with analysts warning the tough times will likely lead to further contractions in coming quarters.    ***********************************  **************************    KEY POINTS:    -- Real gross domestic product fell 0.1 percent in the third quarter, following a revised 0.9 percent slide in the second quarter.    -- This was the first time Japan has suffered two consecutive quarters of contraction, the most common definition of a recession, since 2001.    -- The gross domestic product figure translated into an annualised fall of 0.4 percent, lagging a consensus market forecast for a 0.3 percent expansion.    -- External demand, the balance of exports and imports, reduced GDP by 0.2 percentage point in the quarter.    COMMENTARY:    TATSUSHI SHIKANO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MITSUBISHI UFJ SECURITIES    &amp;#039;I think that it is possible for the negative growth to continue in the second half of the fiscal year.    &amp;#039;The economy abroad, especially the United States, is slowing down and it is likely that exports will remain weak. Meanwhile, even though the Bank of Japan tankan forecasts revenues to bounce back a little bit, I think there will be no change in their decline.    &amp;#039;As the fall of the actual economy becomes more than expected, and as the United States and Europe lower their interest rates, exerting pressure for the yen to be strong and for stock prices to fall, as well as with growing concerns on the outlook of the economy, I think it is possible for the interest rate to be further lowered, or be brought down to zero.&amp;#039;    KYOHEI MORITA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL JAPAN:    &amp;#039;The data was slightly weaker-than-expected, as we had forecast a quarter-on-quarter rise of 0.1 percent in the July-September period. Exports in the quarter especially fell below our expectations and highlighted the weakness of the offshore economy.    &amp;#039;The October-December and January-March data will be very important in determining the future direction of the Japanese economy, as the impact from weakness in offshore economies on domestic demand will basically start showing in October-December.    Barclays sees the Japanese economy marking minus growth in the next two quarters, extending the streak of contractions to four quarters, or all quarters of the fiscal year to March.    &amp;#039;I don&amp;#039;t think weak GDP would prompt the Bank of Japan to implement a further cut in interest rates. It&amp;#039;s too late for a monetary policy to revamp the economy. The economy needs to depend on fiscal policy.&amp;#039;    TARO SAITO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, NLI RESEARCH:    &amp;#039;The GDP shows the continued pain of sky-high prices of commodity products, which resulted in a huge transfer of income from Japan to resource-rich nations.    &amp;#039;Looking ahead, Japan will probably post a continuous and more notable contraction as a slowdown in global economies is expected to affect exports and the appetite for capital spending, which will then hurt consumer spending.    &amp;#039;On the other hand, the recent downturn in commodity prices is likely to soothe the pain of transfer of income from Japan, which will support the Japanese economy.&amp;#039;    JUNKO NISHIOKA, CHIEF JAPAN ECONOMIST, RBS SECURITIES    &amp;#039;The data confirmed what we have been expecting. The Japanese economy is in recession as GDP contracted for the second straight quarter.    &amp;#039;The fall in capital investment is worrisome. Slowing exports are hurting corporate profitability and making them cautious. We need to monitor more data, including trade data, but capital investment is likely to continue to be negative for a while.    &amp;#039;The Bank of Japan has already lowered its outlook for the economy in its twice-yearly report (at the end of October) and the latest data is unlikely to greatly affect the BOJ&amp;#039;s current monetary policy stance.&amp;#039;    MARKET REACTION:    -- The yen weakened after the data against the dollar and euro. The dollar inched up to 96.35 yen from 96.10 yen while the euro rose to 120.50 yen from 120.35 yen    -- For JGB updates click, for prices click    -- Japan&amp;#039;s Nikkei share average fell 1.8 percent after data showed the world&amp;#039;s second-biggest economy was in recession, while exporters felt additional pain from a stronger yen.
