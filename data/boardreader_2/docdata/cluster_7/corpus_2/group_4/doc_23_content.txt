     Quote:                         Halifax has been withdrawn all its tracker deals this evening. Abbey withdrew its entire tracker range just two days after raising rates, while Woolwich, owned by Barclays, was been forced to make changes to its entire range of trackers for the second time in a single day, blaming the &amp;amp;quot;unprecedented base rate announcement&amp;amp;quot;. This morning it raised the rates on its trackers, but this afternoon was forced to pull the range completely.    Nationwide, Northern Rock, the state-owned lender, Alliance &amp;amp;amp; Leicester and a host of building societies have also withdrawn tracker deals today. According to Moneyfacts.co.uk, the financial website, 24 lenders have now withdrawn all their tracker mortgages from the market.                      http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/mon...cle5098702.ece
