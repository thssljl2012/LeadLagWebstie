 Still would want to watch Centro exposure with CBA.. could slash off hundreds of millions of the bottom line if they have to shut up shop on Centro. Will lose more than the dividend price if that comes to pass.     Still would want to watch European &amp;amp;quot;conduit&amp;amp;quot; exposure for NAB due to current recession/possibility of heavy corporate defaults. That could result in further write-downs and possible further cap-raising.      ANZ, made mistakes, probably still making mistakes. Share price still falling the worst, who trusts it? I don&amp;#039;t..     Which leads WBC I guess as the lesser of the evils..
