SYDNEY, Nov 12 (Reuters) - A key measure of Australian consumer confidence edged up from deep lows in November as sharp falls in interest rates and petrol prices lessened a pervasive pessimism about the economy, a survey showed on Wednesday.    The Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index bounced 4.3 percent, or 3.5 points, to 85.5 in November. However, that only recouped part of October&amp;#039;s steep 11 percent dive and still left the index down 22.6 percent on November last year.    Westpac&amp;#039;s chief economist Bill Evans noted many forces pulling in different directions with rate cuts, fiscal stimulus, lower petrol prices balanced by sliding share prices, global economic gloom and tighter credit conditions.    &amp;#039;This is a welcome result,&amp;#039; said Evans. &amp;#039;There has been great uncertainty as to how consumers would react to the barrage of news over the last month.&amp;#039;    The survey was taken in the wake of last week&amp;#039;s bold 75 basis-point cut in cash rates by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) which took rates to a three-year low of 5.25 percent.    The central bank has now eased by 2 full percentage points since September, the most aggressive move since the recession of 1990/91.    The survey of 1,200 people was taken between Nov. 3 and 9.    &amp;#039;However, we should not get too excited about this rise,&amp;#039; added Evans. He noted pessimists still outnumber optimists, and had done for the longest period since the recession of 1990/91.    Consumers remained concerned about their finances given the painful drop in household wealth suffered this year.    The index of family finances compared to a year ago fell 7.8 percent, while the measure for the next 12 months eased by 0.1 percent.    People were also uneasy about the near-term direction of the economy with the index measuring expectations for the next 12 months down 1.8 percent in November.    However, the longer-term outlook brightened with the index for five years climbing 15.7 percent.    Consumers also felt a little more confident about shopping. The measure of whether it was a good time to buy a major household item jumped 15.8 percent, recovering a little of recent heavy falls.
