Hi,      I have 2 fixed loan with CBA which are going to go variable in May 2010 and October 2010. The interest rates are 7.25% and 7.54% fixed.       Now I would like to prepare myself so I dont get into a very high variable rate depending on the economic conditions in 2010.       Obviously I will be fine if the interest rates are still low at the time.      But suppose we have hyper inflation and rates move up very quickly, is it possible to extend the period of my fixed loan if the bank&amp;#039;s variable interest rate goes around 7.25% for 1st property and 7.54% for 2nd property?       And would this be a good idea, are there any other ways to protect myself from very high interest rates?      Thanks.
