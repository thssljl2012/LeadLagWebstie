 November 11, 2008    Article from:  Australian Associated Press        THE Reserve Bank of Australia &amp;amp;quot;lost the plot&amp;amp;quot; when it forecast economic growth next year if interest rates don&amp;#039;t change, according to an economist.         Economist Matt Robinson at website Moody&amp;#039;s Economy.com, a division of Moody&amp;#039;s analytics, says the Reserve Bank of Australia&amp;#039;s (RBA) 2009 growth projections are based on the  &amp;amp;quot;preposterous&amp;#039;&amp;#039; assumption that there will be no change to its cash interest rate.       Referring to the release by the RBA yesterday of updated growth forecasts, Mr Robinson noted that it had estimated gross domestic product (GDP) to grow by just under 2 per cent in 2009.       &amp;amp;quot;Under current policy settings!       &amp;amp;quot;Has the RBA lost the plot?&amp;#039;&amp;#039;       &amp;amp;quot;The central bank is forecasting annualised economic growth would remain between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent in coming quarters with interest rates at their current 5.25 per cent.       &amp;amp;quot;And no new policy announcements from the Federal Government to shore up business and consumer confidence.       &amp;amp;quot;And the global financial market turmoil not getting any worse.       &amp;amp;quot;And demand for Australia&amp;#039;s export&amp;#039;s (particularly from China) holding up.       &amp;amp;quot;This is simply not going to happen.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;       Mr Robinson said if the cash rate was held at its current 5.25 per cent, Australia&amp;#039;s GDP growth rate next year would have  &amp;amp;quot;a big fat negative sign in front of it&amp;#039;&amp;#039;.       As is the norm for the RBA, its latest forecasts rest on key assumptions - a steady exchange rate at US70c, crude oil at $US70 a barrel, and a cash rate at its present 5.25 per cent.       Mr Robinson also said Australia is entering a period of economic uncertainly in better shape than the like of Japan, US, UK an New Zealand.       &amp;amp;quot;But make no mistake; Australia is in for a very rocky ride,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.       &amp;amp;quot;Australia could be lucky and muddle through the current period of great uncertainty and instability without succumbing to recession.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;       Moody&amp;#039;s Economy.com is forecasting the Australian economy to record positive growth in the first and second quarters of 2009, for a calendar year result of a little more than 1 per cent.       &amp;amp;quot;Much more so, however, to avoid recession Australia will require a lot more monetary policy easing, with the RBA cash rate falling to at least 4 per cent,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.       Financial markets currently expect at least a 50 basis point cut to the cash rate in December and further reductions in the first half of 2009.       The RBA has cut rates by 200 basis points since September.       The RBA yesterday made &amp;amp;quot;modest&amp;#039;&amp;#039; downward revisions to its estimates for GDP growth out to December 2010 in its quarter statement on monetary policy.       It now expects annualised GDP growth of 1.5 per cent to December 2008, 1.5 per cent to June 2009 and 1.75 per cent to December 2009.       Mr Robinson has previously worked in the Economic Division of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
