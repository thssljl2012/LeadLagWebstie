By Michael Perry    SYDNEY, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Australia&amp;#039;s slowing economy could be dragged down even further and Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd&amp;#039;s re-election chances in 2010 put at risk after the country&amp;#039;s biggest state economy announced a harsh mini-budget.    New South Wales (NSW) state, with 32 percent of the nation&amp;#039;s GDP, this week announced a mini-budget that will raise an extra A$3.6 billion ($2.3 billion) in taxes and cut infrastructure projects to fill a near A$1 billion budget deficit.    The mini-budget has attracted unprecedented criticism from economists, business leaders, voters and media, who say it flies in the face of efforts to save the economy from recession.    Rudd&amp;#039;s government launched a A$10.4 billion fiscal package last month and the Reserve Bank of Australia&amp;#039;s slashed interest rates to stave off the global financial global crisis.    The Sydney Morning Herald said on Thursday the &amp;#039;incompetent mini-budget&amp;#039; was &amp;#039;one of the most potentially damaging attacks on the public good we have ever seen from an Australian government&amp;#039;.    &amp;#039;As much of the world heads for recession, the under performance of our largest state will further drag down the national economy,&amp;#039; the Australian newspaper said.    Asked at the National Press Club on Wednesday whether the mini-budget would hit the national economy, national Treasury Secretary Ken Henry said: &amp;#039;On the question of whether it will have a macro-economic impact, it may well do&amp;#039;.    Henry said Rudd may have to spend more than his announced A$10.4 billion fiscal package to stimulate the national economy.    Economists said the mini-budget would merely amplify the economic downturn in NSW, with state growth expected to be below the national average of 1.5 percent for 2008-09.    &amp;#039;This should see the state retain its AAA credit rating but it will amplify the economic downturn,&amp;#039; said nabCapital Research senior economist David de Garis.    &amp;#039;This is policy-making with your back against the wall.&amp;#039;    Commonwealth Bank economist James McIntyre warned &amp;#039;adopting pro-cyclical fiscal policy would seem to be counter-intuitive&amp;#039; in NSW, which has borne the brunt of Australia&amp;#039;s high interest rates in recent years and financial sector job losses associated with the global credit crisis.    RUDD&amp;#039;S POLITICAL RISK    The Herald called the NSW budget an attempt to make up &amp;#039;for more than a decade of financial mismanagement&amp;#039; under Labor, which has ruled the state for 13 years.    It warned that Rudd could face a voter backlash in the crucial NSW state when he goes the polls in 2010, due to the state Labor government&amp;#039;s handling of its battered economy.    &amp;#039;The big danger for Kevin Rudd is it damages the Labor brand,&amp;#039; political analyst Norman Abjorensen at the Australian National University told Reuters on Thursday.    Abjorensen said an anti-Labor backlash in NSW at the next national election could unseat Rudd&amp;#039;s government.    &amp;#039;NSW is very crucial. It&amp;#039;s the biggest state, it has the most seats, there are a high number of marginal seats,&amp;#039; he said.    &amp;#039;It only needs a small swing, just over 2 percent, for the federal government to change hands. This could well take place in NSW if Labor is so unpopular as a political brand.&amp;#039;    An online poll of more than 4,000 people by the Daily Telegraph newspaper in NSW found 91 percent wanted the Labor leader Rees to quit and call an election.    &amp;#039;Just sack yourself Premier and call an election&amp;#039;, read the front-page headline of the Daily Telegraph on Thursday.    The Herald said &amp;#039;many people will be wondering if anything can be done to cut short the NSW government&amp;#039;s term&amp;#039;.    &amp;#039;Those asking this question might well include Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, who will go to the polls by late 2010 with the country&amp;#039;s largest state still run by this lame-dog crew, perhaps still in a recession deepened by their failings.&amp;#039;    The NSW Labor premier Nathan Rees does not go to the polls until 2011 under the state&amp;#039;s fixed four-year political term.
