          I am not sure such a blatant attempt to interfere with the normal process of business decision making and an encouragement to adapt a risky behaviour is very responsible.

For example, here is Wayne Swan, Treasurer in the Australian government, after this week&amp;#039;s 0.75% rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia:   &amp;amp;quot;After the Commonwealth Bank today declared it would only pass on a 0.58% rate cut, Mr Swan called for all the banks to pass on the rate cut  in full  in the not too distant future.&amp;amp;quot;   http://www.livenews.com.au/Articles/2008/11/04/Swan_warns_ba...
