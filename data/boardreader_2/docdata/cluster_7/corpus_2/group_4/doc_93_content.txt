Also Government and central banks pumping money in the systems seems working for banks that have plenty of money.   Having said that I still think rates in Australia can&amp;#039;t stay and go low for long time. I would wait that all banks price in the mortgages fixed rates all these cuts and cheap funding costs and would fix by the end of the year.   Also interesting was the forecast from  St George bank :   in their interest rates forecast they&amp;#039;ll expect 4.25 rate from RBA for the last 3 quarters of 2009, while they&amp;#039;ll expect the 3 years bond rate to rise from 4.05 to 4.95 in the last 3 quarters of 2009. That would also mean fixed mortgage rates will rise following the bonds despite the low cash rate. Wonder why they forecast the rise in bonds, what data they have to support that.
