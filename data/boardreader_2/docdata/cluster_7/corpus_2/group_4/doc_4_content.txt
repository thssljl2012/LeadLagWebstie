By Wayne Cole    SYDNEY, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Investors are wagering Australian interest rates could soon be cut by more than a full percentage point as collapsing share markets and deepening gloom over the global economy argue for urgent action to head off recession.    As U.S. equities fell by 6 percent for a second day running and Treasury yields hit 50-year lows, the Australian futures market rushed on Friday to price in rates of 4.01 percent by Christmas, a long way from the current 5.25 percent.    That piles pressure on the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to take drastic action, even though it has already cut its key cash rate by 2 full percentage points since September in the most aggressive easing since the 1990/91 recession.    &amp;#039;The market&amp;#039;s basically signalling that nobody knows what the RBA will do anymore,&amp;#039; said Tony Meer, chief economist at Deutsche.    He noted many investors had been badly wrong-footed by the RBA when it cut by more than expected at each of its past two meetings. Indeed, the central bank&amp;#039;s own staff had initially recommended a cut of 50 basis points in November but just a few days later the board voted to go by 75 basis points.    Likewise, the Bank of England had stunned markets by slashing rates by 150 basis points this month while the Swiss central bank had sprung a surprise 100 basis-point easing on Thursday.    &amp;#039;Having a strong view on what central banks will do can be very costly,&amp;#039; said Meer, with some feeling.    He was hardly alone in being wary on making calls on rates.    &amp;#039;It&amp;#039;s not impossible they could cut by more than 100 basis points, after all the RBA has even surprised itself with the scale of its cuts so far,&amp;#039; said Michael Blythe, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank.    WATCH BUSINESS INVESTMENT    &amp;#039;But we would think 100 basis points is the most the RBA would go, and that depends crucially on what business investment data shows next week,&amp;#039; argued Blythe.    Figures on business spending are due on Nov. 27 and are likely to show firms scaled back formerly ambitious investment plans given the turmoil in markets and tightening credit.    &amp;#039;If there&amp;#039;s a really dramatic pullback in plans, then the RBA will go 100,&amp;#039; said Blythe. &amp;#039;If it&amp;#039;s not so bad, and remember resource investments are planned for the very long-term, then the RBA may ease by less.&amp;#039;    The RBA holds its next monthly policy meeting on Dec. 2, but does not usually hold a meeting in January which might add to the argument for a sizeable easing next month.    Still, Rob Henderson, head of market economics at nabCapital, felt investors were going too far by pricing in 4.00 percent by year-end.    &amp;#039;A cut of 100 basis points is a possibility, particularly if shares keep sliding like this,&amp;#039; said Henderson. &amp;#039;But we still think they&amp;#039;ll go 75 because, when you get down to it, Australia is better placed than the U.S. or the U.K or Japan.&amp;#039;    He argued that rate cuts here had more impact since they fed directly through to mortgage rates, putting money immediately into people&amp;#039;s pockets. In the United States, most mortgages were fixed and linked to agency and Treasury yields -- assuming borrowers could get a mortgage amid the credit crunch.    The Australian dollar had also fallen by over 30 percent in three months, providing a big boost to exports, and a government stimulus package of A$10.4 billion was about to hit wallets in December.    RBA Governor Glenn Stevens this week argued that Australia&amp;#039;s fundamentals were still sound and the main threat was that the country could talk itself into a recession.
