The chief economist for Westpac Bank, Bill Evans, has told a conference in Hobart that the government must spend heavily to keep the economy afloat.      He says keeping the budget in surplus would not be responsible financial management.      &amp;amp;quot;We&amp;#039;ve already seen a very laudable $10 billion stimulus coming from the government, but we need to see more of that, and we need to certainly accept that there&amp;#039;s nothing wrong, in fact it&amp;#039;s responsible to have a deficit in this environment,&amp;amp;quot; he said.                                             Westpac going to go bankrupt Bill?
