         From Marketwatch:  http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/Australian-business-co...     HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Australian business confidence fell to a record low in October, according to a National Australia Bank survey released Tuesday. The bank&amp;#039;s business confidence index fell to minus 29, down 21 points from September, its lowest reading in the survey&amp;#039;s 19-year history.  The index of business conditions came in at minus 11, falling 10 points on month, reflecting the most negative climate since 2001.  Declines were most severe in sectors involving construction, retail, wholesale and transport, although the downturn was broad based, the survey said.  &amp;amp;quot;What the survey is clearly highlighting is the combination of falling sales, profits and confidence has significantly affected employers hiring and firing behavior,&amp;amp;quot; the NAB said in the survey.  Although not indicating the onset of recession, the survey tipped further slowdown ahead, as forward orders came in at minus 20, a decline of 10 points from September.  The survey also found 25% of those who responded had reported increased difficulty in attaining credit.
