                                Quote:                                 Originally Posted by  kaz101                         It was on the news yesterday that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor has said that we are in recession (even though we're not technically).      Read the full articles at:    RBA governor: 'Australia now in recession' - Times Online        AM - Treasurer refuses to detail depth and length of Australia recession        Business Australia in recession: RBA - Weekly Times Now       Personally I think the bad thing about this announcement is that now it's lodged in people's minds and they will accept it and look for things to support it, rather than look for ways of how to become recession proof.      Regards,   Karen                      Thanks for the news, this may possibly lead to postponement of moving to australia in near future.
