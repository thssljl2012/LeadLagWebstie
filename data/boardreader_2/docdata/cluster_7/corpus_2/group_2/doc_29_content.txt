Dexia Cancels 1 Billion-Euro Covered Bond Sale (Update2)   2008-09-01 19:02:03.240 GMT         &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; (Adds plan for a U.S. market in the third paragraph.)      By Esteban Duarte and Neil Unmack   &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; Sept. 1 (Bloomberg) -- Dexia Kommunalbank Deutschland AG, a   unit of the world&amp;#039;s largest lender to local governments,   canceled a 1 billion-euro ($1.5 billion) sale of covered bonds,   three people with knowledge of the transaction said.   &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; The cancellation is due to ``unfavorable market   conditions,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; according to an e-mailed statement from UniCredit   SpA, one of the banks working on the sale. The Berlin-based unit   of France&amp;#039;s Dexia SA planned to sell five-year debt, said the   people, who declined to be named because the details of the   issue are private.   &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; Sales of the notes, which are backed by loans to public   sector institutions or mortgages, have slowed amid the fallout   from the credit crisis as investors demand higher rewards to buy   the securities. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is looking to   create a version of the European bond market to help revive the   U.S. mortgage-bond market.   &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; ``This is a sign that the market is in a critical   condition,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; said Ralf Burmeister, head of covered bond and   financial research at Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg in   Stuttgart.   &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; Ulrike Pommee, a Brussels-based spokeswoman at Dexia,   declined to comment.      &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;Public Loans      &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; Dexia&amp;#039;s bonds were backed by public sector loans and were   priced to yield about 8 basis points more than the benchmark   mid-swaps rate, the people said. Barclays Capital, Commerzbank   AG and Deutsche Bank AG were also managing the sale and the   notes were expected to carry top ratings from Standard &amp;amp;amp; Poor&amp;#039;s.   A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.   &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; Paulson wants to create a version of Europe&amp;#039;s market for   covered bonds in the U.S. just as sales of the debt have fallen   to a six-month low and prices have dropped 2.5 percent this   year. While the securities are backed by loans and bank assets   to get AAA ratings, most are valued, on average, as if they were   three levels lower.   &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; A total 97 billion euros of covered bonds have been issued   so far this year, compared with 115 billion euros in the period   a year earlier, according to research by Societe Generale SA.   &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; He says the $3.3 trillion covered-bond market, which dates   back to 18th-century Prussia, is a remedy for the worst housing   crash since the Great Depression. It offers ``new sources of   mortgage funding&amp;#039;&amp;#039; that will cut costs for homebuyers, he said   at a forum in Washington on July 8.      &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; Final Rules      &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; Paulson introduced the idea of U.S. covered bonds in March,   and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. issued final rules for   the market in July. Collateral for the securities must be prime   residential mortgages that include fully documented borrower   incomes, the regulator said. It limited the amount of the debt   banks can sell to 4 percent of overall liabilities.   &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; Banks would not be able to use subprime or so-called Alt-A   mortgages lacking full documentation as collateral, according to   the regulations.   &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp; Covered bonds achieve higher ratings than regular notes by   augmenting the issuer&amp;#039;s pledge to pay with a group of assets   such as mortgages that can be sold in a default. The extra   security allows lenders to pay less interest.      For Related News:   Top finance stories: FTOP &amp;amp;lt;GO&amp;amp;gt;      --Editors: Glenn J. Kalinoski, Katherine Snyder
