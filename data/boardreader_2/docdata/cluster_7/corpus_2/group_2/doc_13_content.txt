                 OK, I&amp;#039;ll try to explain it. I may have got some things wrong, so don&amp;#039;t treat all of this as absolute truth. There are probably also things that I&amp;#039;ve missed out.    Banks decide that they can make money and spread risk by packaging various kinds of debt into derivatives. Banks get derivatives rated by ratings agencies (who measure the risk on various investments). Ratings agencies (who just so happen to be owned by the same groups that own the banks) rate derivatives as AAA, which is supposed to be pretty much bulletproof. Banks sell derivatives on to buyers who believe them to be safe bets, but aren&amp;#039;t really sure what they are.    Meanwhile, banks are pretty optimistic about the world economy. Growth is steady, investment opportunities are numerous, and money is cheap. Banks start making bigger and bigger mortgages to people (90% or more of property value in many cases, and sometimes over 100%), partly due to optimism and partly due to political pressure. Banks think that this is a safe bet because house prices are going to keep rising.    American house prices drop. Banks realise that they&amp;#039;ve made a bad bet, and they can&amp;#039;t recoup the money through repossessions. Meanwhile, due to inflation caused mainly by high oil prices means that people can&amp;#039;t make their mortgage payments. Now, this wouldn&amp;#039;t be quite as much of a crisis if they knew who owned which debt. But thanks to those derivatives from the first paragraph, they don&amp;#039;t. Chunks of American mortgage have migrated to banks throughout the developed world, packaged into AAA-rated derivatives that now look suspiciously like toxic waste. Of course, there are plenty of good, safe derivatives: it&amp;#039;s just that no-one really knows which ones are deadly.    Now, banks don&amp;#039;t hold enough money to pay off all of their debts at any time, because they&amp;#039;re usually investing it in things. They rely on being able to borrow money from other banks. Normally that works very well, but suddenly banks are looking suspiciously at each other because they aren&amp;#039;t sure if they&amp;#039;ll get their money back. The inter-bank lending rate (the amount that banks charge each other on loans) goes up. Because they can&amp;#039;t get money from each other, they also start lending it to everyone else on less favourable terms.     With a decreasing ability to raise money, a reduction in value of assets, and more bad debts, banks start dying. Northern Rock dies early due to having a higher debt-asset ratio that most other banks, but recently we&amp;#039;ve seen more investment banks (and other financial companies linked to investment, like the insurance group AIG) going under, due to the continuing high price of inter-bank lending and the increasing amount of bad debt. Depending on their percieved value to the global economy, sinking banks are either allowed to be swallowed by other banks (Lehman Brothers) or are nationalised (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac).
