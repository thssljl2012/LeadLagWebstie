           that they pass on any rates change by the Reserve Bank of Australia  (RBA) to borrowers.    The major banks all came off their earlier trading highs immediately  after the announcement, but still closed higher for the day    The Commonwealth Bank was up 1%, or 44 cents, at $43.06, its highest  close in three weeks, Westpac was up for a fourth day, adding 36  cents, or 1.5%, at $24.05, NAB was up 1.6%, or 15 cents, at $24.80,  ANZ was up 1.9%, or 32 cents, at $16.97 and St George was 1.4%, or 42  cents, higher at $30.80.    The RBA this afternoon said it would lower the official cash rate from  7.25% to 7%.    The cut was the first since December 2001 and signals the start of an  easing cycle, after the RBA increased interest rates 12 times between  May 2002 to March 2008.    Swift reaction    Immediately after the RBA announced its decision both the big banks  and non-bank lenders followed by cutting their variable lending rates.    ANZ Bank dropped its standard variable mortgage rate by 25 basis  points to 9.37% for new and existing customers, effective from  September 8.    The bank also dropped rates by 25 basis points on other variable rate  home loan products.    No changes were made to interest rates on fixed term mortgages since  ANZ announced last Thursday it would lower its fixed rates on home  loans and residential investment loans by between 30 and 50 basis  points from September 1.    The bank&amp;#039;s fixed rate for home loans for one year now stands at  8.49%.    Commonwealth Bank of Australia will cut its variable home loan rates  by 25 basis point to 9.33%, from 9.58%.    Its economiser base variable rate will fall to 8.82%, from 9.07%.    The new rates will be effective from September for new and existing  customers, the bank said.    National Australia Bank also passed in full the RBA cut to its  customers. The bank&amp;#039;s standard variable home loan rate will sink to  9.36% from this Friday.    &amp;amp;quot;This change is the result of some relief we have experienced in our  short term funding costs,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; chief executive of NAB&amp;#039;s Australian  operations Ahmed Fahour said. &amp;amp;quot;We hope to see this relief continue as  well as seeing it translate into lower long term wholesale funding  where costs remain elevated.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;    Westpac will cut its standard variable home loan rate also by 25 basis  points to 9.36% effective from Thursday.    The decision was made even though the bank&amp;#039;s funding cost remain  volatile, Westpac group executive retail and business banking Peter  Hanlon said.    &amp;amp;quot;The decision to reduce our standard variable rate reflects Westpac&amp;#039;s  considered approach to managing the impact on our customers of the  challenging funding environment we are experiencing,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.    ANZ and NAB had in the past weeks vowed to pass on any cut by the  Reserve Bank, while CBA and Westpac refused to commit to lower rates.    Australia&amp;#039;s largest lenders have added an average 105 basis points to  mortgage rates in 2008 as the global credit squeeze drove up funding  costs. The central bank has raised its benchmark by a total of 50  basis points in that time.    Today&amp;#039;s cut will reduce repayment on an average $250,000 home loan by  $42 a month.    Dragon trumps rivals    St George stole a march on its major rivals by cutting its standard  variable home loan rate by 30 basis points to 9.37%. The cut was  slightly more than the reduction sanctioned by the Reserve Bank.    The country&amp;#039;s fifth largest bank deliberately waited for its main  competitors, market leader Commonwealth, National Australia Bank,  Westpac ANZ, to lower their standard variable mortgage interest rate  in line with the RBA&amp;#039;s cut and then came in below them.    The move helps bring St George&amp;#039;s main home loan product more into line  with the majors, having hiked its rate slightly higher than most of  the Big Four over the past eight months in the wake of the global  credit crisis.    However, the cut won&amp;#039;t apply until the end of this month - unlike the  others who have moved a lot quicker - as the &amp;amp;quot;Dragon&amp;#039;&amp;#039; argued that by  waiting until then the RBA cut will help reduce its own financing  costs.    Non-bank lenders lower rates too    Non-bank lenders followed suit today and have also cut their variable  home loan interest rates.    Aussie Home Loans will cut its standard variable rate to 9.30%, from  9.55%, effective Friday. This represents a saving of about $52 a month  based on a $300,000 home loan.    Aussie executive chairman John Symond said further falls were likely.  &amp;amp;quot;Borrowers can expect further falls in variable mortgage rates later  this year as a result of weakening global economies,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; he said.    RAMS Home Loans said it will reduce its standard variable rate by 25  basis points to 9.29% from Thursday.    RAMS general manager Melos Sulicich said while short-term funding  costs remain volatile, RAMS wanted to pass on the full rate cut to  customers.    Bendigo Bank&amp;#039;s standard variable interest rate will fall 25 basis  points to 9.40% from next Monday. The cut will apply to new and  existing customers.    It will also be applied across Bendigo&amp;#039;s other variable lending  products, including line-of-credit facilities, business loans,  overdrafts and credit cards, the bank said.    And it applies to mortgages sourced through Adelaide Bank branches in  South Australia, following Bendigo&amp;#039;s recent merger with Adelaide  Bank.   http://www.my-quickloans.com/finance...-Zealand-.html
