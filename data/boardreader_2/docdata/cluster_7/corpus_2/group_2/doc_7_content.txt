Australia&amp;#039;s NAB may use U.S. rescue package-paper                24 Sep 2008     06:16 PM  ET         Font size:                 SYDNEY, Sept 25 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank Ltd &amp;amp;lt;NAB.AX&amp;amp;gt;, the  nation&amp;#039;s top lender, may seek to offload its A$1 billion ($833 million) exposure  in U.S. property markets under the U.S. government&amp;#039;s planned $700 billion  financial rescue package, The Australian newspaper said on Thursday.  Earlier this year, NAB wrote off about A$1 billion due to its exposure to  distressed U.S. mortgage backed securities, the highest by any Australian bank.  &amp;quot;We will take advantage of any opportunities there are, but we couldn&amp;#039;t give  any guidance to anyone about it at the moment,&amp;quot; the paper quoted a NAB spokesman  as saying.  The financial rescue package, which is being discussed by the U.S. Congress,  will be open to non-U.S. institutions, the report said.  It said the increasingly global nature of the crisis was underlined on  Wednesday with the Reserve Bank of Australia entering into a $10 billion deal  with the U.S. Federal Reserve to supply U.S. currency to banks operating in  Australia.
