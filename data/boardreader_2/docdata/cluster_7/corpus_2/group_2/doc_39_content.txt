Yields, Demand Soar On Freddie Short-Term Bills   09/29 11:11 am (ON)   Story 0481 (FNM, FRE)      By Prabha Natarajan      Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES      NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Yields on newly issued Freddie Mac (FRE)  short-term bills rose Monday when investors demanded much higher  premiums as continued uncertainty rocked the short-term credit  markets.      However, the yields on the Freddie bills were quite a bit lower  than those Fannie Mae (FNM) paid last Wednesday, indicating the  slightly improved market sentiment ahead of the pending passage of  the Treasury bail-out plan.      Freddie sold $1 billion of three-month bills at a yield of 2.81%,  about 0.34 percentage point higher than the 2.465% elevated yield  it paid last week at an auction of similar bills.      The mortgage finance giant sold $1 billion of six-month bills at a  yield of 3.242%, 0.39 percentage point over the 2.85% it paid last  weeks for bills of this maturity.      The turmoil in the short-term markets has affected the funding  costs of both Fannie and Freddie since last week, despite the  government takeover of these companies to stabilize them. Last  Wednesday, Fannie paid an unexpectedly high yield of 2.972% on its  three-month bill and 3.459% on its six-month bill.         Strategists say Fannie and Freddie continue to pay more for  short-term funding, just as other companies have done in the  commercial paper market.      The higher yields also drew more investors to bid at the Freddie  auction. The bid-to-cover ratio - the higher the number, the more  the demand - on the three-month bill was at 3.89, a significant  spike from last week&amp;#039;s 2.9.      &amp;quot;There&amp;#039;s a huge appetite for very, very secure short-term paper,&amp;quot;  said Thomas Corona, a senior vice president at Tradition Asiel  Securities, a money market fund.      The government backstop makes these bills the next-most popular  paper with investors after Treasury bills, said Rajiv Setia,  director of fixed-income strategy at Barclays Capital.      &amp;quot;It&amp;#039;s a great trade for money market funds,&amp;quot; he said.      Some market participants felt that the continued fall in Treasury  yields and rise in Libor rates pushed the risk premiums or spreads  on these bills to such elevated levels.      Freddie&amp;#039;s three-month bill was at 239 basis points over comparative  Treasury yields while the six-month bill was 184 basis points over  comparative Treasury yields.         These numbers are huge jumps from the 100 basis points and less  over Treasury yields that these bills priced in recent months.      -By Prabha Natarajan, Dow Jones Newswires; 201 -938 -5071;  prabha.natarajan@dowjones.com      (END) Dow Jones Newswires      09 -29 -08 1111ET      Copyright (c) 2008 Dow Jones &amp;amp;amp; Company, Inc.
