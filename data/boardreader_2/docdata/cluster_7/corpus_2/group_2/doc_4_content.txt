       Cut interest rates soon, business chiefs urge Bank of England   http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2008/09/01/cnmpc101.xml   By David Litterick Last Updated: 10:14pm BST 31/08/2008  Business leaders have called on the Bank of England to cut interest rates soon or risk plunging Britain into a major recession.  The plea from the British Chambers of Commerce comes as the Bank&amp;#039;s Monetary Policy Committee prepares for a difficult meeting at which members must weigh rampant inflation against a stagnating economy when deciding whether or not to reduce the cost of borrowing.  The Engineering Employers Federation said it was up to the Government to put in place policies to ensure that companies are able to survive the slowdown. advertisement  David Kern, economic adviser to the BCC, said: &amp;amp;quot;Most analysts expect the MPC to keep rates on hold at 5pc on Thursday.  &amp;amp;quot;This is despite the fact that the UK economy is very probably in technical recession already, and the risks that the situation would worsen have increased.     Swan calls on banks to follow RBA   http://business.smh.com.au/business/swan-calls-on-banks-to-follow-rba-20080901-46hk.html    * September 1, 2008 - 7:15AM *  Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan on Sunday urged Australia&amp;#039;s major banks to lower interest rates beyond any official rate cut because of lower funding costs on international markets.  Australia&amp;#039;s central bank board meets on Tuesday to consider interest rates, with economists expecting the bank to lower its key cash rate by 25 basis points to 7.0%, ending a string of 12 consecutive interest rate rises since May 2002.  Swan said Australia&amp;#039;s major banks, which this year increased home mortgage rates more than the official increases due to higher international borrowing costs, had no excuse if they did not pass on falls in official interest rates.  &amp;#039;&amp;#039;There&amp;#039;s absolutely no doubt that if the Reserve Bank moves that all banks should follow, there have been changes in the cost of funding in recent times and they will have an impact over time,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Swan told reporters on Sunday.  &amp;#039;&amp;#039;So over time the banks will be coming down, or should be coming down over and above any cut in the Reserve rate.&amp;#039;&amp;#039; A Reuters poll of 20 analysts found all but one expected the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to trim its key cash rate 25 basis points to 7.0% at its monthly meeting on Sept. 2.  The survey&amp;#039;s median forecast was for another cut to 6.75% by Christmas and further easing to 6.25% within 12 months, though opinions varied widely given deep uncertainty over the global economic outlook. While the Resere Bank has lifted its cash rate by 100 basis points in the past year, commercial banks raised their mortgage rates by 150 basis points to cover sharply higher funding costs.  The ANZ and National Australia Bank have already said they will pass on any cut in official interest rates.  Non-bank home lender Wizard Home Loans on Sunday pre-empted the central bank decision and said it would cut its variable home loan rate by 0.25 percentage points to 9.29%.  ``We decided that it is about time someone made a move quickly, decisively and get this process started now,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Wizard&amp;#039;s founder Mark Bouris said.
