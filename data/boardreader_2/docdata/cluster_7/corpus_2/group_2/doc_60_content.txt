 The interest rates in Australia and the current markets here are different to whats happening in the states.      The Reserve bank of australia sets the interest rate and then the commercial banks set their interest rates according to the reserve bank.  So if the reserve bank lowers the interest rate then  usually  the commercial banks follow.  All signs point to the reserve bank lowering interest rates in the coming months.      So by going variable - we&amp;#039;re getting a lower rate then the fixed rate anyway right now, and when the interest rate goes down - we&amp;#039;ll automatically get that rate as well.      Also with the type of loan we&amp;#039;re getting - the special deal is that our interest rate will always be 0.70% lower then the standard variable rate so we&amp;#039;re winning out there as well.      And, the real beauty of the loan we&amp;#039;re getting, is that if we want to fix it at anytime, we pay $300 and we get the fixed interest rate at that time.      So we can take advantage of the interest rate drops that EVERYONE in australia is predicting will happen and when (or on the complete off chance) the interest rates start to go up we can fix it for the cost of $300.      This is a special loan offered by one of the banks here and it is only for first home buyers so not everyone can get access to this special loan.
