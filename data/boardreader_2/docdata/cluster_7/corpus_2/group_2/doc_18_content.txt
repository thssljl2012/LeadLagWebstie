It is. More so then the bail out of ****** Mae or Freddie Mac. The insurance companies like AIG have provided security for massive amounts of debt. Sub prime is small in comparison. If they go the domino effect will be catastrophic. They have to save it.      Ill try and simply it as much as I can. Its complex so there are holes in it, but its a basic overview.      Sub Prime products were provided by banks to boost the American housing market and consumer credit access. They basically provided loans at interest rates lower then the prime rate. Now that house belongs to the bank until it has been paid off so its essentially their asset. The banks used the value of those houses as collateral for investment purposes. Those investments were &amp;amp;quot;insured&amp;amp;quot; through guys like AIG.      As average Americans became more and more debt ridden mortgage stress and inflation started to increase. So Americans began to default on their home payments and credit card payments. The housing market saw a shift and started to see negative growth. The banks had to repossess homes and try and sell them and had to write off insane amounts of consumer debt which could not be recovered     So the value of the houses dropped and their own coffers were hammered with unpaid debts. If the value of the home was less then the original loan (which is the case for a large percentage) they now have an asset that is over valued. This in turn puts the bank into debt!     The problem was that sub prime products were used to boost both assets and profits. That was then reinvested into other everything and anything. They insured the &amp;amp;quot;other investments&amp;amp;quot; through the insurance companies who never thought banks were ever going to default on premiums. The problem is that the banks have started to default on premiums and guys like AIG have had to write off insane amounts of debt.       I hope that explains it.
