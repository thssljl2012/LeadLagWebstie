 HI there      Just wondering if anyone else has come across this.      I note that my MIL was visiting her broker yesterday, quite upset about the turmoil in the markets and her depleting nest eggs (as she is in her 70s) - and was advised to move her funds from Suncorp Metway to either the Commonwealth Bank or Westpac, not ANZ or NAB (due to their exposure to the financial crisis happening in the US).      Just also wondering - as has been raised in previous threads - what will be the impact upon funds available in lines of credit or in loans with a redraw facility.  If we see a bargain and want to grab it - will the funds be available when we need it?      thanks
