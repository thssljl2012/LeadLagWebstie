 NXG Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 1              The other shoe dropping   Nat&amp;#039;l Public Radio had coverage on different facets of this economic mess.  Putnam announced it was closing a &amp;quot;money market fund&amp;quot; with $15 Billion in assets - not becuase it had underlying bad investments; but becuase there was significant withdrawal of funds ( I think in some realms that is called a run on the bank) by major investors.     Also the NPR folks announced that BOTH Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are trying to sell themselves becuase short term lending liquidity which is key to their business operations is just not available.     That means all 5 major US investment banks - Bear, Lehman, Morgan S, Merill, and Goldman- will be gone shortly as stand alone entities.     Given that Barclays is vulture investing Lehman, and others will pick over scraps of other insties, the NY finance kingdom will further unravel. The London exchange has in recent past had a claim to IPO and LBO leadership and they now probably will dominate that arena.    Uncertainty for the biggies and the man in the street should continue the attractiveness of gold as an element of security.     Gold rose today and then fell back; but overall it was up. Overtime their should be a trend up given all the unprecedented uncertainty.      Sports fans may become aware that major teams like the NE Patriots did most of their financing for their stadium using auction rate securties so they are now hurting.  This news means that this crisis is serious. When jocks feel the pinch, we have real trouble in River City.
