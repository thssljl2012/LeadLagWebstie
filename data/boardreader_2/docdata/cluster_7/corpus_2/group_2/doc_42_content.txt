       Asian Investors Buy Only 12% Of Fannie Mae $7B Notes Last update: 9/10/2008 1:32:02 PM      By Anusha Shrivastava     Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES    NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Asian investors bought only 12% of Fannie Mae&amp;#039;s (FNM) $7 billion two-year notes sold Wednesday. In the last sale of two-year notes in July, they had bought 39% of the $3 billion deal.  This was the first deal sold after the government&amp;#039;s takeover of Fannie and Freddie Mac (FRE) over the weekend. Market participants say investors are wary despite government backing due to questions about the future of Fannie and Freddie.  &amp;amp;quot;Asian investors will take a very cautious approach but over time, they will come back,&amp;amp;quot; said Rajiv Setia, an agency strategist at Barclays Capital in New York.  U.S. investors bought 63% of the notes sold Wednesday, and European investors bought only 8%.  The bulk of the debt - 54% - was bought by fund managers. Central banks bought 27%.  The $7 billion debt was sold at 70 basis points over comparable Treasurys, to yield 2.896%.  &amp;amp;quot;Spreads were very attractive for investors,&amp;amp;quot; said Jim Vogel, an analyst at FTN Financial.  The sale of Fannie&amp;#039;s two-year note on Wednesday is the first insight into how investors view debt from Fannie after the bailout.
