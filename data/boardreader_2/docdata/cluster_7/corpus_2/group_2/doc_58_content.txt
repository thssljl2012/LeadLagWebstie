LONDON, Sept 8 (Reuters) - British bank Lloyds TSB is under no pressure to make acquisitions, Tim Tookey, acting finance director, said.    &amp;#039;We don&amp;#039;t feel under pressure to do anything,&amp;#039; Tookey told a webcast banking industry conference in New York.    &amp;#039;It&amp;#039;s true that some assets might be available at lower prices than they have been, but that doesn&amp;#039;t make them attractive per se.&amp;#039;    Tookey also said Lloyds TSB would be largely unaffected if the Bank of England did not replace its current special liquidity scheme after it expires on Oct. 20.    &amp;#039;In terms of the impact on us, it would not be especially material. It&amp;#039;s not a funding source we&amp;#039;re particularly dependent on,&amp;#039; he said.
