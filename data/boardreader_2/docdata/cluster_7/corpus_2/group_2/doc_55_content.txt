SUN - confirmed it has NO exposure to LEH or AIG      WBC - less than A$10mil exposure to LEH       NAB - less than A$100mil exposure to LEH - but noted that includes funds tied up in funding &amp;amp;quot;conduits&amp;amp;quot;...?      ANZ - less than A$146mil exposure to LEH, of which USD$28mil is Lehmann Bros Holding Inc and USD$98mil is it&amp;#039;s subsidiaries.      CBA - *just* announced a A$150mil exposure to LEH and left it at that, citing it was &amp;amp;quot;working through&amp;amp;quot; it&amp;#039;s exposure...!         so, i would advise your MIL to get a new broker.
