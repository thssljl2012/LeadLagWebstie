 FNM Message Board Posts     &amp;amp;nbsp;    Recs: 3              GUYS!  I&amp;#039;m getting increasingly nervous about this LEH deal....  If you are short, you need to make sure you are hedged.   I wouldn&amp;#039;t be surprised if Barclays announces the deal at $10 a share...    There is no options activity for retail, but there is options activity for institutionals...    They need to F*CK the shorts and F*CK them in a big way...    They are not announcing the details of the deal...  What are they waiting for?  Why?    I think they are waiting for the FED announcement.    Plus Barclays is one of the banks participating in the $70 billion fund, I think....    They may be thinking that they can crush the retail shorts on the LEH deal, and they are going to work together.    DO NOT WAIT FOR LEH TO GO TO ZERO through BK court.  IT IS TOO DANGEROUS.    Again, just a hunch...    Wolf
