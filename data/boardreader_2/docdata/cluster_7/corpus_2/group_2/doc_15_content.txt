As long as the bank could sell the loan to someone else before that interest rate adjusted, they kept the profits and the buyer got the risk.  They could then take those profits and make more loans, rinse, repeat.  The initial buyers of the loans from the bank them combines them with other loans, most of which were not so risky, and sold shares of the whole package of loans.  These shares were rated as being extreemly safe by the rating agencies and were insured by insurance companies like AIG, but in the end nobody knew who owned what and what it was really worth.      Now we have a situation where just about every bank owns some of these potentially tainted shares, but no one knows how much or what they&amp;#039;re worth and so they&amp;#039;re afraid to loan money to anybody, including other banks, because any of them could collapse tomorrow.                      I&amp;#039;m not sure I can follow you. This is what I think I interpreted:      (a) Banks offer loans to buyers.   (b) Buyers combine loans and sells shares of the whole package.   (c) Every bank owns some of these shares.      I&amp;#039;m sure I&amp;#039;m misunderstood (b) because I can&amp;#039;t see how to get from (b) to (c), unless the buyers of the original loans effectively sell the loans straight back to the banks as &amp;amp;quot;shares&amp;amp;quot; (??). As a buyer, can you  sell  shares of a loan anyway? Surely that means all the buyers are mutual funds or limited companies?
