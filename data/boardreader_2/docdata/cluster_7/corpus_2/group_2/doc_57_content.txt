 Hi I&amp;#039;m 23 and im about to buy my first property- as an investment property. I wont get the first home owners grant because i want to rent it out. Living in the property will be to hard as i will struggle with repayments. I have spoken to the commonwealth bank about a loan, but i really dont know what type of interest rate to go with.. Should i go with a fixed rate for a few years or should i leave it as a variable rate as the rba are expected to drop rates next month again. I dont want to be stuck with a fixed rate in case it does keep dropping below that. I do like the idea of the same repayments however i have a bit of leway- if it does go up I can easily cover the extra costs.      Anyone have any advice about this? Im currently living at home but i want to move out to the city ( currently live 40 min away) but im not sure if i would be able to afford both. I know at tax time I can claim depreciation but is there anything else I can do to make it easier on myself if i decide to move out and also have a mortgage?
