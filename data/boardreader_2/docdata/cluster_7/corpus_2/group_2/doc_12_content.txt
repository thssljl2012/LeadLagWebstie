Wouldn&amp;#039;t a bailout plan for homeowners solve the problem by shoring up the finances of the lending institutions?    Remember it&amp;#039;s the large number of mortgage defaults that have weakened the position of the lending institutions.                        No, not at this point in time. IF we did that a year ago, it would likely have worked and stopped the problem from getting worse.    If Bernanke had set the interest rate really low last year, it would have greatly lowered the reset rate of a lot of these mortgages,  The high rate reset is what caused a lot of the foreclosures.  A barely affordable mortgage payment turns unaffordable. And yes, that could have greatly lessened or solved the problem. But Bernanke didn&amp;#039;t listen to Cramer. He was too worried about inflation to set the interest rates low enough to take care of this.    Now it is too late. The houses have been foreclosed, the values have fallen so that the banks and mortgage companies  can&amp;#039;t recoup the money they lent, and the mortgages and the collateralized mortgage paper  are possibly worthless.  There was so much defaulting that it in turn caused the insurance companies who backed this paper to fail, including AIG. Which in turn makes the banks under capitalized, and they start to fail.  And so it goes. You can&amp;#039;t unring the bell.    There is another problem, which is the Collateralized mortgage papers, I think they are called CDOs were such a mishmash of mortgages, ostensibly to spread the risk of subprime and Alt-a mortgages, that people can&amp;#039;t untwist them to see what they own. Some of the mortgages, some of the paper is actually good, but it is not easy to separate the good part from the bad part. Which means that even with the bailout, we the taxpayers might end up okay with the returns from the good mortgages.
