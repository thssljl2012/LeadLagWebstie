The former investment bank is already exempt from the restrictions that apply to its new status for as long as five years, the New York-based company said today in an e-mailed response to questions. Morgan Stanley and rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. became bank-holding companies Sept. 21 to gain greater access to federal funds.    ``Morgan Stanley will seek permission from the Federal Reserve to continue to own and operate its commodities business as currently operated once the grace period expires,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; London- based spokesman Carlos Melville said in the e-mail. Morgan Stanley ``will be able to continue to operate its commodities business as presently constituted in all material aspects.&amp;#039;&amp;#039;     ..    Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became commercial banks a week after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed and Merrill Lynch &amp;amp; Co. sold itself to Bank of America Corp.    Goldman now ranks fourth in assets, trailing Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan &amp;amp; Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley is the fifth-largest.    Value at Risk    In terms of commodity trading, Goldman is the largest, followed by Morgan Stanley and London-based Barclays Capital, according to Sanford C. Bernstein.    Goldman&amp;#039;s value at risk in commodities, a measure of how much the firm estimates it could lose in a single day, rose to $51 million in the three months ended Aug. 29, from $48 million in the second quarter, according to the company&amp;#039;s regulatory filings. That of Morgan Stanley fell to $35 million a day in the third quarter, from $39 million in the preceding three months.    Morgan Stanley owns Denver-based fuel-distribution company Transmontaigne Inc. and Heidmar Inc., a U.S. oil-tanker business.    ``Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will have to reduce the capital intensity of their balance sheets by reducing exposure to merchant banking and by shedding commercial real estate and physical commodities assets,&amp;#039;&amp;#039; Sanford C. Bernstein analysts led by Brad Hintz in New York said in a report yesterday.      http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601207&amp;amp;sid=arV.SiJ8Bm8M&amp;amp;refer=energy
