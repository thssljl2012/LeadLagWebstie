Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) CEO, Ralph Norris, has warned that dividends may be cut in response to the financial crisis. Norris said the bank may not be able to pass on future official interest rate cuts because of a dramatic increase in wholesale funding costs. CBA reported a 16 per cent fall in profit for the six months to 31 December 2008.
