By Anirban Nag SYDNEY, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank said the global recession would continue to depress the domestic economy in the near term, but held out the prospect that significant stimulus from lower interest rates and fiscal spending would lead to stronger demand later this year. Minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) Feb. 3 policy meeting released on Tuesday showed its policy board felt that government stimulus would take time to work and would have a modest effect in the near term. 'Given the speed at which the global contraction has occurred, short term prospects were thus still for weakness in demand and output,' the minutes showed. 'Nonetheless, the substantial measures taken would help to cushion the economy from the contractionary forces coming from abroad and, over time, work to establish conditions conducive to stronger demand later in the year.' At the February meeting, the central bank cut its key cash rate by 1 percentage point to a record low of 3.25 percent, citing a grim global outlook. On the same day, the Labor government weighed in with a fiscal stimulus package of A$42 billion ($27 billion) in infrastructure spending and income support, on top of A$10.4 billion of pump priming late last year. The Australian dollar slipped with markets still pricing in a further 50 basis points cut by the RBA in March. But some analysts think it might prefer to wait and see how past easing is working. 'The RBA does not feel obliged to respond further to immediate weakness,' said John Edwards, chief economist at HSBC. 'If the Australian economy continues to weather the storm as well as it has for the last few months, the RBA may find that today's cash rate of 3.25 percent is quite low enough.'
