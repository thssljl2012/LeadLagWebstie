The New Zealand dollar fell 1c against the greenback overnight as the United States currency strengthened on its appeal as a safe haven.  The kiwi reached a week-high around US51.90c about 10pm but then fell away to US50.90c shortly before the local open and by 8am was buying US50.98c.  Data showing the pace of existing US home sales fell 5.3 percent in January weighed on stocks and triggered more US dollar buying against the euro. 'The negative housing data the lack of any bottom in the plummeting housing market along with sharply lower stocks have rekindled the demand for safe-haven (US) dollar assets,' said Omer Esiner, senior market analyst at Ruesch International in Washington.  The NZ dollar also fell away during the night against the euro, from near 0.4040 around 10pm to 0.3997 by today's local open. For now, 'the euro continues to be weighed down by problems in the euro zone,' said Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York, in a note to clients.  ANZ bank said topside attempts for the NZ dollar overnight were spurred on by a stronger euro, then US selling interests in the euro had managed to see the NZ dollar reverse all the overnight gains.  Against the Japanese currency, the NZ dollar reached a five-week high around 50.35 yen before falling away to 49.62 by 8am.  The kiwi was buying A78.77c at 8am against the Australian dollar, slightly down from A78.90c at 5pm yesterday. The trade weighted index was 52.31 at 8am from 52.34 at 5pm.
