Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) has reacted to the boom in first-home buyers taking advantage of Federal Government assistance schemes to take on mortgage loans. The bank will now demand that at least 3% of the amount lent is contributed by the borrowers themselves. Other banks have also recently raised the percentage a deposit on a home loan must cover. CBA notes that the new policy is prudent given that interest rates will be likely to rise again in a few years from current lows. Publication Date: 23 February 2009
