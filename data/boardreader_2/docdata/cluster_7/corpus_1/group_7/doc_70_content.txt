TAIPEI  Taiwan saw a record drop of 44.1 percent in its exports in January as demand for its products slackened around the world, the government said Monday.  The island's exports for the month totaled US$12.37 billion, down $9.76 billion from a year earlier, marking the fifth consecutive monthly decline, the ministry of finance said.  January imports fell 56.5 percent from a year earlier to $8.97 billion, marking the fourth consecutive monthly decline, the ministry said.  In December, exports fell 41.9 percent and imports dropped 44.6 percent year-on-year.  However, Taiwan's trade surplus in January rose to $3.40 billion from $1.86 billion a year earlier.  Last month, exports to China and Hong Kong plummeted 58.6 percent from a year earlier to $3.71 billion, shipments to the US fell 26.5 percent to $1.95 billion and sales to Japan dropped 17.9 percent to $1.12 billion.  Exports of Taiwan-made electronic products fell 45.3 percent from a year earlier, base metal and related products were down 43.6 percent and plastic and rubber products, 44.7 percent.  Cheng Cheng-mount, chief economist of Citibank Taipei, said the steep drop in January exports was expected, as the island could not escape deteriorating global demand.  However, he said he expected the island's exports to improve in February because some electronics manufacturers, in particular flat panel companies, had received large orders from mainland China. 'The mainland orders are expected to alleviate downturn pressure on exports to some extent. But whether Taiwan's exports will bottom out is up to how the global economy develops,' Cheng said.
