Yen continues to be the weakest currency in otherwise consolidative markets after release of the largest trade deficit since 1980. Investors sentiments were boosted by Bernanke's comments yesterday. While making no new grounds on the economic outlook and forecasts, the Chairman rejected the idea that the 'stress test ' will lead to Government's takeovers of large financial institutions. This temporarily relieved the market's concerns of bank nationalization and CDS for Citigroup and Bank of America dropped from record highs. DOW Rebounded strongly by over 3.3% and Nikkei followed by rise 2.65% in Asia today. Note that except clear weakness in the Japanese yen, markets are rather mixed elsewhere as consolidations in common pairs continue. Focus will now turn to Q4 GDP from US, Existing home sales from US as well as second round of Bernanke Testimony. Released in Asia, trade deficit in Japan widened to -952.6B yen in January, better than market expectation of -1129.5B yen but almost tripled the -332.3B yen in December. The biggest deficit since 1980 was driven by the record -45.7% yoy decline in export. Shipment to the US slumped by -52.9% while that to Europe also dropped -47.4% due to global recession as well as rapid surge in Japanese yen. Economy in Japan was not better than its foreign counterparts and the imports plunged 31.7% yoy, worse than consensus of -28.2% and December's -21.5%.   Released in early European session, Germany GDP confirmed to have contracted -2.1% qoq, -1.7% yoy in Q4. Imports dropped -3.6% while exports dropped -7.3%. In the UK, Q4 GDP is expected to have revised downward to -1.6% qoq and -1.9% yoy from -1.5% and -1.8% respectively as nearly all sectors of the economy contracted during the quarter with the business and financial services industry came under extremely high pressure.   Existing home sales in the US probably rose slightly by 1.3% to 4.75M units in January from 4.74M units a month ago. Despite this, inventory remains at high level and homeowner should continue to reduce prices so as to drive transaction. The Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will testify before House Panel at 1500 GMT. In a testimony before the Senate, the Fed Chairman rejected the idea of 'bank nationalization' as it would 'destroy the franchise value' and would 'create legal uncertainties'. However, the Treasury will buy convertible preferred stocks in the 19 largest banks if they are determined to be as risk to overcome deeper recession.   Technical outlook in the Dollar Index remains unchanged. A short term top is formed at 88.24, below 88.46 high after rise from 77.69 completed five wave sequence. Subsequent price actions should be corrective in nature and could extend lower towards 83.58 support. But downside should be contained there and bring rally resumption that eventually push the dollar index through 88.46 high.  GBP/JPY rises further to as high as 141.74 today so far, meeting mentioned target of 141.52 cluster resistance. At this point, intraday bias remains on the upside as long as 139.16 minor support holds. Sustained trading above 141.52 will target 38.2% retracement of 215.87 to 118.81 at 155.88 next. On the downside, below 139.16 minor support will suggest that a short term top is formed and bring pull back. But consolidation should be relatively brief as long as trend line support (now at 132.55) holds.   In the bigger picture, whole decline from 215.87 has completed the five wave sequence already (184.47, 197.42, 129.71, 141.52, 118.81). The three wave structure of the rebound from 118.81 is so far consistent with the view that price actions from there are corrective in nature. It's uncertain whether such correction will develop into sideway pattern below 141.52 cluster resistance (23.6% retracement of 215.87 to 118.81 at 141.71) or strong rebound to 38.2% retracement of 215.87 to 118.81 at 155.88. But in any case, decisive break of 18.81 low is needed to confirm that medium term down trend has resumed. Otherwise, even in case of deep fall, GBP/JPY is just treated as developing in to medium term consolidation with at least another rise before completion.
