WARSAW, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Poland's current account deficit widened in December from November, central bank data   showed on Thursday, underlining shrinking demand for Polish   exports in the recession-bound euro zone.   The data showed the current account gap stood at 1.920   billion euros in December, up from a downwardly revised 1.637   billion euros for November but below an analysts' forecast of   2.0 billion euros.   Analysts said declining imports also pointed to slowing   demand in Poland, the European Union's largest ex-communist   member state, as the global economic crisis takes its toll on   industrial output and consumer confidence.   The bank's data showed the trade deficit stood at 1.688   billion euros in December.   Exports stood at 6.806 billion euros in December, down from   8.815 billion the previous month, while imports slowed to 8.494   billion euros from 10.334 billion in November.   ***************************************************************** FORECAST:   Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a   December current account deficit of 2.000 billion euros.   MARKET REACTION:   The Polish zloty and bond yields were   unchanged after the data.   ANALYSTS' COMMENTS:   JOZEF SOBOTA, HEAD OF CENTRAL BANK'S STATISTICS DEPARTMENT   'The fall in foreign trade is mainly a result of the drop in   external demand. We see a fall in trade with our largest partner   Germany. However, the fall in the volume of trade in Poland is   smaller than in other countries of the region.   'One can observe an almost symmetrical fall in both exports   and imports and this means that... the current account to Gross   Domestic Growth (GDP) ratio stays roughly stable.   'This also has to do with the fact that in modern industry   there is strong division of labour... For example cars produced   in Poland have a strong input from factories in other countries.   'I think (current account to GDP) ratio stood anywhere   between 5 and 5.5 percent in 2008.'   PIOTR KALISZ, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT CITIBANK HANDLOWY:   'The data is not surprising. It is slightly better than we   expected but close to the market consensus. It is absolutely   neutral for the zloty.   'The deep fall is just a continuation of a trend that   started in October. Falling imports are showing consumption is   weakening, which reflects the sharp (economic) slowdown.   'The current account is likely to improve in the coming   months due to faster falls of imports than exports because of   the weakening zloty.'   GRZEGORZ MALISZEWSKI, SENIOR ECONOMIST AT MILLENNIUM   'The data shows the economy is suffering more than expected   from the euro-zone recession. This is reflected in a very deep   fall in exports, which reached 16.4 percent. This is a result of   the worse-than-expected situation in Europe, our main trading   partner.'   'It is also worth noting we had a negative balance in   direct foreign investments. We suffered an outflow of FDI in   December.'
