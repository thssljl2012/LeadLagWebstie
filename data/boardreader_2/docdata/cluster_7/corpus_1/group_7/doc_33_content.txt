National Bank said 87 per cent of businesses expected the unemployment rate to rise.  A net 29 per cent of businesses expected to take on fewer staff in the coming year. This was a seven percentage point deterioration from the end of 2008. 'The mover and the shaker in this month's survey is employment intentions,' the bank said. With the exception of construction, employment intentions were uniformly worse across all sectors at, or close to, historic lows.  Overall, business people felt pretty much the same way in February about the economy and their own company's outlook as they did in December, according to the survey.  A net 41 per cent of respondents expected general business conditions to deteriorate over the coming year, down from a net 35 per cent expecting conditions to deteriorate in the December survey.  A net 20.1 per cent expected tougher times over the year ahead for their own businesses. This compared with a net 22 per cent expecting worse times ahead in the December report. 'The messages across the survey remain sombre,' National Bank said. 'Against the backdrop of stimulus in the form of aggressive interest rate cuts, a falling currency and fiscal stimulus, it is perhaps disconcerting to see the aggregate message from the survey remain so poor,' the bank said. Profit expectations were less negative but investment intentions hit a new low, with a net 15 per cent expecting to reduce investment during the coming year.
