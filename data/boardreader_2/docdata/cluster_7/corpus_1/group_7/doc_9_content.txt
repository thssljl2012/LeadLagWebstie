The Australian dollar was firmer at noon as a weaker Japanese yen gave the local currency a boost.  The dollar was recently trading at $US0.6437, up from Thursday's close of $US0.6423.  The Australian dollar opened the local session at $US0.6454, after investors sold the yen on concerns about the Japanese currency.  A senior dealer with online currency firm Easy Forex, Francisco Solar, said the Australian dollar had benefitted from an easing in risk aversion during the offshore session.  'If you look at the euro and some yen crosses, we are seeing them at slightly higher levels,'' Mr Solar said. 'With the euro and the Aussie, we have seen a slow grind higher.''  The local currency was trading at 60.56 yen at noon, up from Thursday's close of 59.07 yen.  Mr Solar said weaker share markets had restrained the rise of the Australian dollar in the past 12 hours.  'That is why the Aussie has not pushed above 65 US cents,'' he said.  The appearance of Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Glenn Stevens before the House of Representatives Economics Committee in Canberra gave the dollar a small boost, pushing it to $US0.6483.  But Mr Solar said governor Stevens did not commit to how low the cash rate, currently at a 45-year low of 3.25%, would go.  'We'll be prepared to go low enough to what is needed,'' Governor Stevens said.  Earlier, Governor Stevens told the committee: 'It is not my present expectation we're going to find ourselves at nothing.''  For the rest of the local session, Mr Solar said the Australian dollar would trade between $US0.6400 to $US0.6500.  Meanwhile, the Australian bond market was flat to weaker at noon.  The yield on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was 4.220%, down from Thursday's close of 4.225%, while the yield on the April 2012 bond was at 3.148%, up from 3.113%.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March 10-year bond futures contract price was 95.810, up from Thursday's close of 95.805, while the March three-year bond futures contract price was at 96.875, down from 96.905.
