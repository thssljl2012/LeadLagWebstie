WELLINGTON, Feb 13 (Reuters) - New Zealand retail sales fell for the fifth quarter in a row in the three months to December, backing views the recession has deepened and the central bank will keep cutting interest rates. Retail sales volumes fell 0.6 percent versus the previous quarter seasonally adjusted, official data showed on Friday, compared with a Reuters survey forecast for a 0.5 percent decline. The value of seasonally adjusted sales fell 1.1 percent on the previous quarter. *************************************************************** KEY POINTS: - Fall in Q4 seasonally adjusted volumes driven by lower vehicle, department stores and supermarket/grocery sales, offsetting rises in recreational and appliance sales. - December month seasonally adjusted sales down 1.0 percent (Reuters poll -0.3 pct). Core sales (ex-auto) fell 0.6 pct on November. - Click on for full table COMMENTARY: PHILIP BORKIN, MARKETS ECONOMIST, ANZ-NATIONAL BANK 'There's weakness for the month across all measures. For the quarter spending has contracted again, which reinforces the likelihood of another contraction in GDP (gross domestic product). 'For monetary policy, obviously the domestic economy is still very weak and so we expect rates still to be eased as a result. SU-LIN ONG, SENIOR ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS 'It is a pretty weak figure and confirms that New Zealand had another quarter of weak economic activity. That coupled with weak housing activity in 2009 confirms that a recession continues and presents a downside risk to the RBNZ's (Reserve Bank of New Zealand) own economic forecasts. The RBNZ will have to cut interest rates, but probably not as much as 150 basis points that they did last month.' SHAMUBEEL EAQUB, ECONOMIST, GOLDMAN SACHS JBWERE 'This marks a full 12 months of contraction in retail sales volumes. It neatly captures the weak state of the domestic economy, with houses deleveraging and labour market weakness the two key risks facing the retail sector. Sharply lower interest rates and escalating fiscal stimulus should be a positive but most of the relief will probably be concentrated in 2010.' DARREN GIBBS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK 'I'm not really taking anything too interesting out of the release. At the moment we've got a very subdued consumer sector, very weak housing sector and the question is in 2009 is that going to change? We'll probably see some change given we've had a massive easing in monetary policy, but it's going to take some months for that to come though in the data.' MARKET REACTION: - The New Zealand dollar eased a touch to $0.5200/05 after the data. The yield on the December bank bill contract fell one basis point to 3.13 percent compared with the 3.5 percent official cash rate.
