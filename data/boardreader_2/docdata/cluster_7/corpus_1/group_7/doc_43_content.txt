The Australian bond market opened firmer as rumours that the US government would nationalise two major banks affected the appetite for risk.  But the local bond market is expected to face selling pressure on Monday as the downgrading of Queensland's credit rating makes investors question the ability of state governments to raise finance.  At 0830 AEDT, the yield on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was 4.103 per cent, down from Friday's close of 4.165 per cent, while the yield on the April 2012 bond was at 3.058 per cent, down from 3.108 per cent.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March 10-year bond futures contract price was 95.975, up from Friday's close of 95.865, while the March three-year bond futures contract price was at 96.960, up from 96.905.  The Australian bond market firmed in line with US Treasuries during the offshore weekend session as investors responded to media reports that the US government was considering nationalising Citigroup and Bank of America.  ICAP senior economist Adam Carr said this news had hurt risk appetite.  Equity markets around the globe sold off aggressively: that carried a solid bid tone for (US) Treasuries and we're seeing that carried over (in Australia), Mr Carr said.  There's this element of risk aversion.  There was talk of US nationalisation of banks. These rumours were losing momentum a little bit but ... that created a sense of fear not only how bad things are but how much worse there is to go.  Ten-year US Treasury yields fell seven basis points to 2.79 per cent, while Wall Street's SP 500 index dropped 1.14 per cent.  With no major Australian economic data due to be released on Monday, Mr Carr said the local bond market would face selling pressure as investors responded to news on Friday that Queensland's credit rating had been downgraded.  The key driver for Australia today will be Queensland's credit downgrading, Mr Carr said.  It could have some serious impact in terms of the currency and (bond) spreads being pushed higher.  We might see some (selling) pressure if people started questioning the ability of Australian states to raise finance, and how this could start to impact on the Commonwealth government.  Credit ratings agency Standard and Poor's downgraded Queensland's credit rating to AA+, from AAA.  Until recently, Queensland was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the commodities boom but now it joins Tasmania as the only other state not to have a AAA rating.  Analysts expect NSW also eventually to have its credit rating downgraded because of its negative outlook.  Standard and Poor's cited the deteriorating budgetary performance of Queensland flowing from declining revenues, including mining royalties.  The downgrading followed a revision of Queensland's budget forecast from a surplus of $809 million in June to a $1.57 billion deficit for the 2008/09 financial year.
