 4:03 pm  Consumer group Choice and the  (HIA) have welcomed the move by the Commonwealth Bank to tighten home lending standards.  The bank has announced that it will require  to contribute 3 per cent of the purchase price on top of any government grants.  Some of the other big banks have also reduced the proportion of the property value they are willing to lend to borrowers.  Choice spokesman Christopher Zinn says contributing your own money will have short and long-term benefits. 'If you can bring some of your own funds to purchase a home, it makes sense in the short term in terms of savings with mortgage insurance,' he said. But also of course in the long term ... you will pay off the debt, or potentially you can, in a far quicker, far more economic way.' The  says moves by the banks to tighten home lending standards to first-home buyers are responsible.  HIA chief executive Ron Silberberg says people are more likely to keep on top of repayments if they have contributed some of their own cash to the deposit. 'There are good reasons why all home lenders should lend responsibly,' he said. 'They should avoid situations where they tangle particularly  in loans that are too high and don't allow for the possibility of rate changes.'
