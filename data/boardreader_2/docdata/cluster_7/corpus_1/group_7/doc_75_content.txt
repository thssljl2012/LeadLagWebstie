WARSAW, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Polish industrial output fell by 14.9 percent year-on-year in January, statistics office data showed on Thursday, more sharply than expected and exceeding a 4.4 percent decline in December. The data highlights a slump in both exports and domestic demand, analysts said. Economists in a Reuters poll had predicted output to have contracted 11.5 percent year-on-year last month. In month-on-month terms, industrial output fell 5.8 percent, while seasonally adjusted output fell 12.7 percent year-on-year, the data showed. In other data released on Thursday, Polish producer prices rose 3.0 percent year-on-year in January, up from 2.6 percent in December and above market expectations of 2.2 percent. ************************************************ KEY FIGURES: INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT Jan 2009 Dec 2008 Jan 2008 Year-on-year (pct) -14.9 -4.4 10.7 Month-on-month (pct) -5.8 -3.7 4.3 PPI Jan 2009 Dec 2008 Jan 2008 Year-on-year (pct) 3.0 2.6 2.9 Month-on-month (pct) 1.7 -0.5 1.2 * Denotes revisions MARKET REACTION: The Polish zloty fell immediately after the data while bond prices remained stable. FORECASTS: Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast: * 11.5 percent year-on-year fall in industrial output in January * 2.2 percent year-on-year rise in producer prices in January. COMMENT: PIOTR BUJAK, SENIOR ECONOMIST AT BANK ZACHODNI WBK IN WARSAW 'The data is worse than consensus... so this should strengthen market expectations for interest rate cuts. 'In our opinion the data supports a 50 basis point cut in February, especially now that the zloty has rebounded after a significant weakening.' '(This data) is the effect of a slump in exports but also of a slump in internal demand.' 'As far as producer prices are concerned, one can assume that (their rise) is a result of the zloty's fall, which makes export prices rise sharply.' PIOTR KALISZ, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT CITIBANK HANDLOWY IN WARSAW 'A relatively large fall in industrial output shows that in the first quarter economic growth will probably slow to 2 percent or even below that level.' 'This data also confirms that the slowdown is connected with the slump in exports which can be seen in the manufacturing sector.' 'In our opinion, despite this data, the MPC will leave rates unchanged for fear of excessive zloty weakening.' BACKGROUND: * Polish January CPI may signal smaller rate cuts ahead * Polish fin min: 2009 growth may be below 1.7 pct-paper (Writing by Dagmara Leszkowicz) Keywords: POLAND OUTPUT/ (dagmara.leszkowicz@thomsonreuters.com, RM: dagmara.leszkowicz.reuters.com@reuters.net, tel +48 22 653 9718) COPYRIGHT Copyright Thomson Reuters 2009.
