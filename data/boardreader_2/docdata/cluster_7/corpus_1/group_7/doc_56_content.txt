ABS data shows Australian workers now take home $1166 a week / File  Average weekly pay hits $1165  Miners, bankers paid the most  AUSTRALIAN workers now take home an average of $1166.50 a week, 5.5 per cent more than what they were pocketing a year earlier.  And miners continue to be the nation's best paid workers, taking home an average of $1965 a week. That's an increase of nearly 7 per cent from a year earlier.  Construction workers, riding on the coat tails of the mining boom, also posted a hefty wage jump of more than 8 per cent, taking their average weekly wage to $1194.  Finance and insurance workers posted a 4 per cent rise to $1442 per week in the year to November, while workers in property and business services posted a 6 per cent jump to $1283.  Data released yesterday showed rates of pay were growing at a far slower pace than a year ago, and the number of job vacancies took a sharp dive in February.  Total hourly rates of pay, excluding bonuses, rose 1.2 per cent in the December quarter. The wage price index rose 4.3 per cent from a year earlier, ABS data released yesterday showed.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia senior economist Michael Workman said further large wage increases are unlikely if the unemployment rate climbs as predicted.  Workers in cafes, restaurants and hotels posted a marginal 1 per cent increase in pay to $836 a week, less than half of what an average mining worker takes home.  Retail workers were also paid well below the average, taking home $881 a week, an increase of 1.9 per cent from a year earlier.
