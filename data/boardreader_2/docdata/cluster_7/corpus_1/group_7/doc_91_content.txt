The National Australia Bank's commerce survey shows business confidence plunged to a record-low in the December quarter as the economy slides towards its first recession in 18 years.  The prospect of rising unemployment is expected to spark more aggressive interest rate cuts in 2009.  Business conditions now have worsened for four consecutive quarters, since hitting a peak in late 2007, NAB said. 'This represents the largest annual fall in business conditions since entering the 1990/91 recession,' the report said. A plunge in the employment measure weighed down business conditions, with profits and trading also falling.  The survey's business conditions measure fell 12 points in the December quarter to minus-16, the lowest reading since September 1992 when Australia was emerging from the last recession. 'Businesses expect conditions to slow significantly further in the March quarter of 2009,' the report said. NAB's business confidence measure dropped by 24 points to minus-31 in the three months to December, the lowest reading since the series began in 1989.  The mining, agriculture and retail sectors all were gloomy, with business confidence across all sectors now worse than during the 1990s recession.  NAB expects the Australian economy to shrink by a quarter of a percentage point in 2009, before growing by just one per cent in 2010. 'When an economy shrinks over a 12-month period that clearly represents a recession,' the report said. 'That said, the forecasts imply a relatively mild Australian recession, especially compared to falls in growth of around two per cent in the major industrialised economies.' An economic recovery was not expected to begin until late 2009.  NAB is predicting an economic growth pace of zero in 2009/10, compared with the Federal Treasury's forecast of 0.75 per cent.  The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) was expected to cut interest rates, now at 3.25 per cent, by 75 basis points in March and follow up with more mid-year cuts until the cash rate hit a record low of two per cent.  The cash rate has not been below this level since the RBA was legislated in 1959.
