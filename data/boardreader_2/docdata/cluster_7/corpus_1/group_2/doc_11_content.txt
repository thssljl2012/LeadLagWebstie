MADRID, Sept 17 (Reuters) - The collapse of Lehman Brothers and the U.S.-government rescue of insurance group AIG will have a limited impact in Spain, the stock market regulator and Economy Minister said on Wednesday. The Spanish stock market regulator CNMV said in a note that Spain's Collective Investment Institutions (IIC), or investment funds, have a global exposure to Lehman of 300.2 million euros, or 0.13 percent of their total investment as of July 31. Earlier, Spanish Economy Minister Pedro Solbes assessed the exposure of Spain's economy to Lehman and AIG (nyse: AIG - news - people ) at 'a few dozen million euros'. Lehman, the world's fourth-largest investment bank, filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this week. On Tuesday the Bank of Spain said the country's banks are healthy, with good levels of solvency and profitability.  tf.TFN-Europe_newsdesk@thomsonreuters.comjlw   Thomson Financial News Limited 2008.
