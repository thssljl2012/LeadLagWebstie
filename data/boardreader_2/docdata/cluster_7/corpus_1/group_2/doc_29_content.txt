INVESTORS are watching to see how much the finances of local banks and investment firms were tied up with collapsed US investment bank Lehman Brothers.Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy on Monday, as investment bank Merrill Lynch sold itself to Bank of America while the worlds largest insurance company AIG teeters, in one of the worst days in Wall Street history.ANZ says its total exposure to the Lehman group of companies is around $US120 million ($148.5 million).The exposure comprises a $US28 million exposure to Lehman Brothers Holdings and $US92 million to Lehman subsidiaries, the bank said.'ANZ is not in a position at this time to provide an estimate of the likely loss, if any,'' it said.ANZ added that Lehman subsidiaries are not part of the parent's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the US yesterday.'Lehman Bros are also amongst 800 counterparties included in the underlying assets for ANZ's credit intermediation trades; their default has little impact on the level of first loss protection.''Lehman Bros' filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission listed ANZ as having $85.3 million worth of exposures via two banks loans worth $US44 million and $US25 million.National Australia Bank says its total exposure to the Lehman group of companies is less than $100 million.Commonwealth Bank of Australia said earlier today it had an exposure to Lehman of less than $150 million. It is believed most of this is held in a commercial loan, sources familiar with the matter said.Westpac's exposure to Lehman is less than $10 million, the bank said.Payment delaysTwo local investment funds, Alpha Managed Fund and Macquarie Groups Generator Investments both announced to the ASX that they would be hit by Lehmans collapse. Both repackaged debt from companies and mortgages, and investors receive a stream of income as the debt is repaid.Macquaries Generator said Lehman made up 2 per cent of their income portfolio, and that Octobers payments to investors would be delayed until January. They warned that they could not predict how much that would be.Councils hitCouncils will also be hit hard, with $400 million in New South Wales estimated to be invested in funds that rely on mortgage debt and repayment for their income.Wingecarribee Shire Council in rural NSW is suing Lehman over a $70 million bad investment.Media reports suggest several councils in NSW are considering suing Lehman Brothers, and may turn to the already cash-strapped state government for help.NSW Premier Nathan Rees said many Australian councils bought triple-A rated Grange Securities, of which Lehman Brothers was a subsidiary.'The fallout of the sub-prime crisis is clearly not complete. Fiscal rectitude is the order of the day.'Mr Rees said the government was yet to receive any request for assistance from NSW councils.'As I understand it we haven't received formal representations from either the Local Government and Shires Association or the individual councils. That will be a matter for the local government minister to deal with but it's on our radar obviously,'' he said.Mr Rees said a mini budget due in eight weeks would detail state spending and the impact of the US collapse on state finances.''We don't even know the scale of the loss we're talking about ...'' he said.The Victorian government also said it is not immune, with acting Premier Rob Hulls calling the collapse a substantial issue.'But I think we have the fundamentals right in this state, but it would be foolhardy to think that we are immune from global economic conditions.The Victorian state opposition has released a list of eight Victorian entities it said were exposed to the Lehman Brothers collapse.They are: Western Health, Northern Health, Goulburn Valley Health, Benalla and District Memorial Hospital, Gippsland Ports, East Gippsland TAFE, Metropolitan Ambulance Service and the First Mildura Irrigation Trust. The Liberal Party spokesman said the total ran to the millions of dollars.
