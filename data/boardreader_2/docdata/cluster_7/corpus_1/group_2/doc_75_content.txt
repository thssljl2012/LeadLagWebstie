By Cecile LefortSYDNEY, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Struggling Australian non-bank lenders are looking at ways to revive the moribund mortgage-backed market, but the costs may be prohibitive allowing major banks to further corner the home lending market.Non-banks in Australia have suffered since the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis blew up 13 months ago because they are reliant on the securitisation market to fund their operations, unlike banks which can use their balance sheet or deposit base.Issuance of Australian residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) slumped in the first half of the year to just under A$2 billion ($1.67 billion) from A$47 billion a year earlier.Almost all of the new issuance came from major banks.Non-banks are now working with mortgage buyers on a new scheme whereby issuers would put aside a special cash reserve to cover any losses in their securitised portfolios, providing greater security for investors. 'We want non-banks to have incentives to service properly the loans if insurers fall over,' said a fund manager who asked not to be identified.Unlike in the United States and Britain, Australian prime RMBS are all insured by lenders mortgage insurers (LMI), giving buyers greater security.But since the credit meltdown, insurance companies have been hit hard with rising losses and increasing concerns about their creditworthiness as the crisis worsens.The Australian units of PMI Mortgage Insurance Group Inc and Genworth Financial Mortgage Insurance, Australia's two dominant insurers, are rated AA- and AA respectively by S&amp;amp;P but both have negative outlooks. 'Investors are looking for protection because everyone is concerned about the ratings of the lenders mortgage insurers,' said Mary Ploughman, director at non-bank lender Resimac.In contrast to the United States, there has never been a default of mortgage-backed debt in Australia, nor a default of a mortgage insurer.STUMPING UP THE CASHAustralia's Challenger Financial Services Group  was the first borrower to respond to such concerns last week when its mortgage unit securitised A$441 million ($375 million) of home loans. The offer included for the first time in Australia a special reserve of 1 percent, or A$4.4 million. 'It's an amount of cash sitting there, put in by Challenger on day 1,' said Yvette Tse, an analyst at Fitch ratings.Challenger's move is likely to pave the way for others.Australian non-bank lender FirstMac is already considering a similar approach to refinance a mortgage-backed issue of A$175 million by Oct. 20 in an offer to be jointly run by ANZ Investment Bank and HSBC. 'We are likely to follow the same path but not with the same amount of 1 percent,' said FirstMac's Chief Financial Officer James Austin, who did not give more details.Some analysts, however, worry that the extra cash will put additional pressure on non-banks which are already fighting for survival. 'Non-banks are already at the point, frankly, where it is barely economical to securitise, when you have investors now also requiring higher retention levels, it just knocks the economics of it all,' said Paul Dowling, principal analyst at Sydney-based banking research firm East &amp;amp; Partners.Non-bank Bluestone Group, Liberty Financial, Resimac, FirstMac have all significantly cut their home lending, while RAMS was forced last year to sell part of its business. 'The writing is on the wall for non-bank lenders,' said Craig Saalmann, credit strategist at JPMorgan.Australian's top banks have now increased their mortgage lending market share to 98-99 percent, from 85 percent before the crisis hit, according to bankers' estimates.
