Credit agency predicts local bank profits will fallBanks still well placed to get through global credit crisisPROFITS for the nation's banks will be hit this year and into 2009 as loan growth slows and impaired assets and funding costs rise, ratings agency Fitch says.The agency also predicts in its semi-annual review that industry consolidation will continue, although it will mainly feature smaller lenders because the bigger deals have 'stumbling blocks'', including the Four Pillars ban on major bank mergers, The Australian reports.Despite its gloomy outlook on profitability, Fitch said the nation's banks remained in relatively good shape.'Australian banks, particularly the larger, more diverse institutions, appear to have withstood the pressures of the ongoing credit crisis relatively well,'' associate director financial institutions group Tim Roche said.British and US banks have so far borne the brunt of more than $US500 billion ($620 billion) in global losses and write-downs from the sub-prime fallout, with local lenders having minimal direct exposure.Initially, higher wholesale funding costs, as well as more limited exposure to funding markets for smaller banks, put pressure on industry profits.But that has since been magnified by deteriorating asset quality.Fitch said in its report that most provisions had been raised against highly leveraged corporates that found it difficult to secure refinancing, although there were write-downs against structured credit products by ANZ and National Australia Bank.While asset quality was likely to further deteriorate in the second half of the current financial year, due to the weaker economy, it would still compare 'very favourably'' with international peers.Fitch noted around half of total loans on local bank balance sheets were residential mortgages.'These loans remain in relatively strong shape despite increasing pressure on households through higher interest rates and oil prices,'' it said.'In part this is because there appears to be an undersupply of housing in Australia, with construction unable to meet new demand, while rental vacancy rates are at or below 2 per cent.'Also, unlike a number of markets in the US, banks in Australia have full recourse to a borrower's assets, which provides extra incentive for a borrower to continue servicing their loan.''Read more on this story in The Australian.
