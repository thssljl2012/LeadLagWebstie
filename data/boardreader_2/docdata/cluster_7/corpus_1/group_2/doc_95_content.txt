 XL Leisure Group, the UKs holiday company, is in urgent talks with its banks after plans for a refinancing hit delays, reports The Times. The groups lenders, Barclays and Icelandic group Straumur, were understood to be considering their options at the weekend. Airline industry sources said that Barclays had recruited Kroll, the corporate-restructuring specialist, to advise. XL is understood to be looking for a new lender after Barclays pulled financing associated with fuel-hedging positions on Aug 14. XL, which underwent a management buyout in 2006, has grown quickly to become third largest in the UK holiday market behind Tui Travel and Thomas Cook. XL Airways, its airline, flies to more than 50 destinations.
