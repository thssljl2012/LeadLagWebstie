Barclays had been considering making a bid for Lehman Brothers for some time, the bank'schief executive John Varley said this afternoon.This preparation meantthe groupwas able to move quickly to make an offer for those parts of the businessit wanted when the bank filed for bankruptcy protection, Varley said.Speaking to journalists and analysts on a conference call, the Barclayschief said the group had been keeping an eye on opportunities to take advantage of thedislocation in the market during the credit crisis.He said Barclays had identified Lehman as apotential target,but because ofBarclays' stringent approach to capital discipline, ithad been waiting for a move in the price.Varley said this interest had meantBarclayshad been'minimising our exposure to Lehman' over the summer.And Varley said the group had not yet finished with Lehman and is still looking at assets outside of Northern America. He said:'We are alreadyacting on the opportunities we think are beneficial to us,'.But he emphasised these are 'options but not obligations'.Among these options, he said Barclays is looking at UK and European staff in the investment banking and Capital markets business.Because of due diligence doneover the weekend and the group's long standing interest in Lehman's businesses, Barclays had been able to be 'very deliberate' about whatit had acquired and saidit would continue to be very deliberate.'There are areas where we clearly already have a strong position and we would not want to add staff,'said Bob Diamond,Barclays'spresident.As for the logic of today's deal, Barclays management said there was a fantastic strategic fit and the business Barclays were acquiring were good businesses with strong revenues.'Lehman's cash equity business is extremely profitable,' said Diamond.'The franchise of the trader dealer business remains strong &amp;amp; healthy,' said Varley'Lehman has scale and depth in the US but not in the same areas as Barclays Capital,' he added.By product, Lehman brings excellence inequities andgovernment-backed bonds, whereas Barclays Capital brings excellence in commodities and forex, among others.Varleysaid there would be some overlap but said it was 'surprisingly little'.Quizzed on today's fundraising announcement, Varley said the Lehman deal would have been accretive even without any issuance but - since the group had the support of someits shareholders - thought it wasa good idea to combine the two operations in order to fund future growth of the newly acquired business.'It is right for us to be quite thoughtful about what capital we need to grow this business,' Varley said.The group was also keen to calm one other concern expressed by analysts - whether Barclays Capital wouldbe able to retain key Lehman staff.'The people at Lehman like an environment of pay for performance,'Diamond said.While Varleysaid there is no guarantee the deal will getapproval, he did say that as far as he knowsno-one else has filed an interest in this business with the US bankruptcy court. Hesaid Barclays had been able to move fast because it was so well prepared.Most importantly, Bob Diamond said there are few people that could offer such a good deal to the courts.
