Australian financial stocks plunged after Lehman Brothers failed to find a saviour over the weekend, raising the prospects of a fresh round of global write offs and reigniting fears that there is no end in sight for the credit crisis.Shares of NAB were hammered, losing as much as 4.9%, or $1.17, to $22.79, taking it back to 2007 lows. ANZ Bank gave up as much as 3.6%, or 62 cents, to trade at $16.63.''We're factoring in a worse case scenario,'' said Lisa Jarvis, financial adviser at ABN Amro Morgans. ''That is for Lehman to fail. It sets a precedent for the weakest stocks flailing in the US market.''Ms Jarvis said the market is struggling to understand how much of counterparty risk would be unleashed on to financial services companies that have done business with Lehman. Investors would also be looking for the next major investment bank to collapse, she said.Macquarie Group has dropped as much as 9.2%, or $4.06, to $39.95, to levels not seen since 2004, as the diversified investment fund's stock struggles under the shadow of Lehman's cloud.There are similarities between the types of businesses Macquarie has and those of Lehman, she said. Macquarie is ''not as vanilla as a major bank in Australia. It's probably a bit more inventive,'' she said.Macquarie more exotic businesses place it closer to investment banks in US and the similarity is pulling down Macquarie's stock she said.Adding to the jitters among financial service stocks, former Babcock &amp;amp; Brown chief Phil Green has quit the infrastructure investment business' board.The announcement sent the company's shares tumbling as much as 26.5 cents, or 14%, to $1.635 in early trade.
