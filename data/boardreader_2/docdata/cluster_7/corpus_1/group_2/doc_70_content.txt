A bit rich ... major banks including National Australia Bank enjoyed record profit margins when they lifted mortgage interest rates independently of the RBA / Chris Pavlich.Banks cried poor when lifting ratesBut their interest income far outweighs interest costsThey are enjoying record profit marginsAUSTRALIA'S major banks were enjoying record profit margins when they cried poor and lifted mortgage interest rates independently of the Reserve Bank, The Australian reports.Official figures show the profit margin for the major banks was 54.8 per cent in the March quarter, resulting in $1 profit for every $2 in interest and fee income they charged.The banks' profit margin during the quarter was more than double the long-term average return of 26.9 per cent.The record margins coincided with claims by major banks that higher funding costs made it necessary to lift interest rates by more than official RBA increases, claims supported by Treasurer Wayne Swan.The Commonwealth, the National Australia Bank, the ANZ and Westpac all lifted their mortgage rates by more than the Reserve Bank.'I don't recall too many people saying that bakers shouldn't put up the price of bread when the cost of flour rises,' ANZ chief executive Mike Smith said at the time.Westpac head of consumer financial services Jeremy Dean shared his customers' pain, saying: 'We know this rise will stretch many family budgets. However, the cost of wholesale funding continues to rise.'However, the official figures released yesterday by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority show that the interest income of the four major banks from loans was rising by substantially more than the interest they were paying to depositors and the wholesale markets.Rising interest rates and increased lending enabled the banks to raise their interest income in the quarter by $7.2 billion, compared with a year ago, to a record of $31.9 billion.Interest costs were up by $6.3 billion in the same period, with net interest income moving ahead by 12.9 per cent to $8.3 billion.
