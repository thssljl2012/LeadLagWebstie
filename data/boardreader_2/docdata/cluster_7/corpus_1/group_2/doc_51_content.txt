SYDNEY, Sept 25 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank Ltd  and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group said they may take advantage of the U.S. government's planned $700 billion financial rescue package if given the chance.The two banks are seen as having the biggest exposure to the global credit crunch among the country's big four lenders and both announced hefty writedowns earlier this year. 'There is not enough detail or clarity around the U.S. rescue package. We would try and take advantage of any opportunities that would emerge,' a NAB spokesman said on Thursday.Details of the rescue package, which is still being discussed by the U.S. Congress, are yet to be finalised though it is expected to allow the Treasury to buy assets from any financial institution.Earlier this year, NAB wrote off about A$1 billion ($833 million) on its exposure to distressed U.S. mortgage-backed securities.In July, ANZ warned its profits would fall sharply and forecast it would take A$1.2 billion ($1.0 billion) in provisions on bad debt in the second half.Mike Smith, Chief Executive at ANZ, the country's third largest bank, speaking at a business lunch Thursday said ANZ may also look to tap into the U.S. government's rescue package.NAB and ANZ also have some exposure to collapsed U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers. NAB has put its exposure at less than A$100 million, and ANZ said its was about $120 million.A spokeswoman for Westpac, Australia's fourth-largest bank, on Thursday said it had no need to take advantage of the U.S. rescue package. It has already said its exposure to Lehman was less than A$10 million.Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd, the No. 2 bank, has put its exposure to Lehman at less than A$150 million.(Reporting by Mette Fraende; Editing by James Thornhill) . lw
