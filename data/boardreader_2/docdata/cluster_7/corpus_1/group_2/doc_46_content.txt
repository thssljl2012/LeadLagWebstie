 Consumer group Choice has calculated the top five big banks will make $3.4 million for each day they do not pass on a 0.25 of a per cent interest rate cut.It says it is concerned that while National Australia Bank and the ANZ have committed to passing on a cut, the other banks may drag their feet if official rates are lowered tomorrow.Christopher Zinn from Choice says the banks that have not made a commitment will make about $2 million if they withhold the 0.25 per cent cut. 'You could say that they have significant financial incentives not to move,' he said. 'We would say that if the banking sector was competitive enough they should move and as a matter of justice and equity they should certainly pass on any rate cut as soon as possible.'
