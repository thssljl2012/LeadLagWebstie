THE sharemarket skidded to its lowest close since the start of the US subprime mortgage crisis, as investors punished financial stocks and ignored signs of life in the economy.Contradicting early indications from the futures market, the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 Index closed 91.2 points, or 1.9%, lower at 4814.3 points.It was the market's weakest close since February 2006, when the term 'subprime' was a little-known classification on the books of US mortgage providers.In Australia, the market reached a record 6828.7 points in November 2007, before succumbing to the credit crunch.Since then, the economy has stalled, although yesterday's surprisingly strong employment data suggested hidden strength despite the negative mood. Asian markets also suffered, with Japan's Nikkei losing almost 2%, China's CSI 300 Index dropping 3.3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng down 3.1%.Goldman Sachs JBWere traders Richard Coppleson and Shelley Maclean said Australian trade was thin. 'At the half-way mark today volume was a pathetic $2.5 billion and it seems there are not a lot of investors willing to bet on moves in the US,' they wrote in a note to clients. 'Indeed, they still seem to be suffering a nasty hangover from the Hank Paulson party that took place on Monday.' In just a week investors have seen the US Government step in to ensure the continued operation of its mortgage market, with the bail-out of mortgage finance companies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.The intervention, sponsored by US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, could end up as one of the most expensive in US financial history.In addition, the weakness of America's fourth-biggest investment bank has been exposed, with Lehman Brothers reporting an expected third-quarter loss of almost $US4 billion ($A4.96 billion).The multinational has not been able to boost its capital - as so many of its competitors have done - with an injection of funds from a sovereign wealth fund.Bank of America head of global corporate and investment banking Brian Moynihan added to the woes with comments at a New York conference.He said Bank of America expected further loan losses because bad debts among residential customers were contaminating commercial borrowers. 'It's not pretty,' he said, explaining that people who had commissioned houses were not able to pay their builders, causing many builders to default.Reflecting the uncertainty in the sector, Australian financials were hit hard yesterday, with the five major banks accounting for more than a third of the market's losses.National Australia Bank fell $1.20 to $23.88, Commonwealth Bank lost $1.50 to $42, Westpac was down 99 at $23.26, ANZ dropped 76 to $16.85 and St George Bank lost $1.04 to $30.60.There was little confidence in the turnaround stories of companies such as Allco Finance Group and Babcock &amp;amp; Brown - they fell about 15%.And property trusts Centro Properties and Centro Retail, which were savaged because of a lack of affordable debt caused by the credit crunch, lost more than 8% each. http://abs.gov.au
