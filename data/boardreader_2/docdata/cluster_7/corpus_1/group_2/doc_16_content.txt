ONCE mighty equities are being removed from global markets, or whittled down to nothing, exaggerating losses for superannuation funds.Most balanced funds, which have a large exposure to Australian equities, have already reported a reduction in funds under management for 2007-08.The market itself fell almost 17% last financial year, and is down almost 27% over the past 15 months. Add to that the passing of Lehman Brothers and the US Federal Reserve's takeover of insurance company AIG, and another source of value, from investments in international equities, is gone.Last week, the US Treasury also assumed responsibility for the country's biggest mortgage finance companies, destroying billions in shareholder value at the same time.'AIG is not going to come back for equity holders and neither are Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or Bear Stearns or Lehman,' said Catholic Super Fund's chief investment officer Tim Hughes. 'They represent permanent losses of wealth.'But that has not convinced Mr Hughes to ignore international equities. Catholic Super has about 35,000 members, with almost $3 billion under management. About 24% of that money is invested in international equities, stocks that Mr Hughes says represent good value, particularly after such rapid declines on global markets.BlackRock Investment Management vice-president James Holt said the Australian market had a large concentration of financial and resources stocks. But if an individual wanted to invest in health care or information technology, they would likely look overseas.Besides, with compulsory superannuation, super funds would outgrow the Australian equities market, forcing them to look elsewhere for well-priced investments.'What would worry me a lot right now is watching the reaction of members,' UniSuper trustee director Chris Cuffe told an Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees lunch in Melbourne. 'If they watched their losses on a day-by-day basis it would probably take years off their lives.'Warren Chant, a director of superannuation ratings service Chant West, told the same gathering that while most people could be content with the balanced fund option, for those people over 60 years of age, it made sense to move towards more conservative asset classes.'For people who are over 60  if they lose their money, their ability to earn it again is much less than someone who's 20 or 30 or 40,' he said.
