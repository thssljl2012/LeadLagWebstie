QUEENSLAND public servants' superannuation remains secure despite a $30 million exposure to collapsed US investment bank Lehman Brothers, Queensland Treasurer Andrew Fraser says.Two state government organisations have $30 million of exposure to Lehman Brothers which filed this week for bankruptcy in the US.Mr Fraser said the government, through the Queensland Treasury Corporation, also had a potential $376 million exposure to troubled insurance company  (AIG). However, the US Federal Reserve today offered AIG an $US85 billion ($107 billion) lifeline.It will take a 79.9 per cent stake in AIG in return for a $US85 billion emergency loan.Mr Fraser said he was not worried about any other potential exposures for Queensland. 'Not at this stage,' Mr Fraser told reporters while in Sydney today. 'Obviously, I don't think that many people a week ago were expecting that the world would be in this situation. 'We are in no different position to most other financial institutions.' He said other Queensland superannuation holders would have to ride out the storm. 'Superannuation is a long-term investment and it does have a short-term impact on Queenslanders looking at their superannuation accounts,' he said. 'Public servants in Queensland, they remain best-placed around Australia and that is we are the only state with a fully-provisioned superannuation scheme. 'That money's all essentially locked away, it remains absolutely fully-funded.' Mr Fraser said the Queensland treasury's strategy was to continue to be conservative in its outlook. 'Obviously we have an underlying strength in our balance sheet, an underlying strength in our budget surplus that means that we are better placed than most to be able to absorb these things,' he said.
