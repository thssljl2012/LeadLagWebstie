 Financial stocks plunged as Lehman Brothers said it will file for bankruptcy, making it the second large US investment house to be claimed by the subprime mortgage crisis after Bear Stearns in March. The news of Lehman's failure has hammered Australian banking stocks. Shares in NAB lost as much as 4.9%, or $1.17, to $22.79, taking it back to May 2000 lows and bringing its year-to-date losses near 40%. Macquarie Group, whose business has spread into areas similar to Lehman's, has dropped as much as 9.7%, or $4.27, to $39.74, to levels not seen since November 2004. Macquarie shares have lost nearly half their value since the beginning of the year. Macquarie is 'not as vanilla as a major bank in Australia. It's probably a bit more inventive,'' said Lisa Jarvis, financial adviser at ABN Amro Morgans. Regarding Macquarie, Ms Jarvis said, ''we're factoring in a worse-case scenario. That is for Lehman to fail. It sets a precedent for the weakest stocks flailing in the US market.'' Ms Jarvis said the market was struggling to understand how much of counter-party risk would be unleashed on to financial services companies that had done business with Lehman. Investors would also be looking for the next major investment bank to collapse, she said, with concerns about the viability of insurer American International Group rising. ANZ Bank lost as much as 3.6%, or 62 cents, to trade at $16.63. It, along with NAB, have announced billions of dollars in write-downs tied to the fall in asset values this year. The Commonwealth Bank shed as much as 3.4%, or $1.47, to $41.52 while Westpac has lost as much as 2.4%, or 57 cents, to $22.95.
