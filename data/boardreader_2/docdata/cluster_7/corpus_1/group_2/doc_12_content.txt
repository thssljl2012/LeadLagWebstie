AIC Limited, the holding company owned by Jamaican-Canadian billionaire Michael Lee-Chin, has hit back at reports questioning its exposure to the US financial crisis, denying claims that the company has suspended dividend payments to shareholders.Robert Almeida, senior vice-president and portfolio manager at AIC sought to clarify the company's structure to alleviate concerns, arising from an article that highlighted AIC's exposure through one of its funds. He said that AIC Limited manages mutual funds for investors including equity, income, bond, balanced and money market funds with, 'A variety of geographic mandates and in a variety of forms.' 'The assets in these funds are completely segregated from the assets of the manager with Citigroup serving as Global custodian,' he said. 'Any gains or losses on these portfolio are for the account of investors in the funds. 'The dividend reference in the article refers to one of these funds, the AIC Global Financial Split Corp, which is a fund with a mandate to invest only in global financial institutions, a sector that is at the centre of the global financial crisis,' he emphasised. Contrary to what he calls 'sensational' reports, he said that the company's exposure to embattled firms American Insurance Group (AIG) and Merrill Lynch, is currently less than five per cent, and even so, recent acquisitions of these firms have limited the adverse effects. 'With respect to Merrill Lynch and AIG, the current exposure is less than five per cent and recent events have effectively limited downside risks with Merrill Lynch being acquired by Bank of America, and AIG, potentially by the US government.' 'The bottom line is to focus on the 95 per cent of the fund that is strong and undervalued and not be distracted by the sensational headlines that apply to the five per cent of the fund - don't let the tail wag the dog,' he emphasised.
