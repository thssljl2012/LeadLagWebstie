The housing market was hammered in August, with sales numbers hitting a 26-year low, and today's expected Reserve Bank interest rate cut is not expected to help much, some economists and agents say.Real Estate Institute figures for August were 'unequivocally weak', with turnover down another 10 percent in the month, ASB Bank economists said.It is also still taking a long time to sell properties, about 56 days, and the national median price was down $10,000 in a month to $330,000. Only 4220 properties sold in August, just half the levels seen in the same month in 2006. The institute's August figures show the national median price is down 5.7 percent from a year ago, and forecasts of a 5 percent to 10 percent fall this year appeared to be 'on the money'. Institute president Murray Cleland said sales volumes in August were 'painfully low'. But he expected a period of stability late this year or early next year. 'Much will depend on the Reserve Bank's decision on the official cash rate and the expected decrease will take the pressure off mortgage costs,' he said. The bank is widely expected to cut the official cash rate from 8 percent to 7.75 percent, but the first cut in July could not save the market in August, economists said. 'Weak demand and oversupply is starting to drive down the median sale price,' said ASB Bank economist Jane Turner, who expected prices to be down about 7 percent by the end of the year.Against the trend, median prices in the Wellington region rose from $371,000 in July to $375,000 in August. Harcourts Wellington managing director Marty Scott said a rate cut today would help confidence, but mortgage rates were not expected to fall far. Today's rate cut has already been factored into existing interest rates, according to some economists, though competition may see some move.STRAW HOUSES: National median selling price: $330,000 in August, down 5.7 per cent in a year. 4220 sales in August, the lowest monthly total in 26 years. 103 properties sold for over $1 million in August half the levels of a year ago.
