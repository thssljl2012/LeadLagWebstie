(BizWorld) Paddy Power's financial spread betting venture, paddypowertrader.com says it has has seen a 110pc rise in clients placing equity trades in the past 24 hours. Recent international market turmoil in the banking sector, the company says, has encouraged speculation among spread bettors according to the online financial spread betting company. 'We have seen an increase of 110pc in banking shares, as well as those short selling both the UK and US indices, on an average trading day,' a spokesperson said. 'At the top of the list of those being traded are Merrill Lynch, Insurance giant AIG, Allied Irish Bank, Anglo Irish Bank, Barclays and Alliance and Leicester. 'The eye of the storm still centres on Merrill Lynch and Lehman Bros. These colossal investment banks are being flooded by huge losses accumulated since the credit crunch began. Lehman Bros has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, bringing over 150 years of the fourth largest investment bank in the US to an end. 'Meanwhile other banks such as Merrill Lynch, who are to be bought by Bank of America at a cost of $50bn, are still very vulnerable.'We have seen a huge increase in the number of trades compared to regular trading activity. 'Even though volatile markets such as these are difficult to predict, we have also seen a glut of clients taking profits from short selling the rapidly changing markets. It's a good time for spread betting as it offers much more diverse investment opportunities,' he said. Previous StoryNext Story
