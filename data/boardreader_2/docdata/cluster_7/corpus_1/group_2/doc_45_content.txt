 CANBERRA, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan on Sunday urged Australia's major banks to lower interest rates beyond any official rate cut because of lower funding costs on international markets.Australia's central bank board meets on Tuesday to consider interest rates, with economists expecting the bank to lower its key cash rate by 25 basis points to 7.0 percent, ending a string of 12 consecutive interest rate rises since May 2002.Swan said Australia's major banks, which this year increased home mortgage rates more than the official increases due to higher international borrowing costs, had no excuse if they did not pass on falls in official interest rates.'There's absolutely no doubt that if the Reserve Bank moves that all banks should follow, there have been changes in the cost of funding in recent times and they will have an impact over time,' Swan told reporters on Sunday.'So over time the banks will be coming down, or should be coming down over and above any cut in the Reserve rate.'A Reuters poll of 20 analysts found all but one expected the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to trim its key cash rate 25 basis points to 7.0 percent at its monthly meeting on Sept. 2.The survey's median forecast was for another cut to 6.75 percent by Christmas and further easing to 6.25 percent within 12 months, though opinions varied widely given deep uncertainty over the global economic outlook. While the Resere Bank has lifted its cash rate by 100 basis points in the past year, commercial banks raised their mortgage rates by 150 basis points to cover sharply higher funding costs.The ANZ and National Australia Bank have already said they will pass on any cut in official interest rates.Non-bank home lender Wizard Home Loans on Sunday pre-empted the central bank decision and said it would cut its variable home loan rate by 0.25 percentage points to 9.29 percent.'We decided that it is about time someone made a move quickly, decisively and get this process started now,' Wizard's founder Mark Bouris said.(Reporting by James Grubel, Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
