There are doubts today's expected cut to the official cash rate will be enough to lower home mortgage rates. Most analysts are picking the Reserve Bank will shave a quarter of a percent off the cash rate. ASB Bank economist Jane Turner says banks have already factored in today's expected cut into mortgage rates and if the Reserve Bank wants to bring lending rates down, it will have to also promise more fairly dramatic rate cuts over the next few months. However she considers that is unlikely, given current high inflation expectations. ANZ chief economist Cameron Bagrie says if there is going to be a surprise today, it will probably be in relation to the tone the bank takes on how far it is prepared to cut rates. He believes Reserve Bank governor Alan Bollard will flag further interest rate cuts, but that he will not take the OCR down too far. Mr Bagrie is expecting the bank to hold the OCR around seven percent.
