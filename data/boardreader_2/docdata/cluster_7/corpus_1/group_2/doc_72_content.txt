WELLINGTON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Two of New Zealand's largest retail banks, ASB and Westpac joined state-owned Kiwibank in cutting home mortgage rates on Thursday after the central bank cut its benchmark cash rate by more than expected. ASB said its floating home lending interest rate would fall by 0.5 percent to 10.25 percent, and also lowered its rates for fixed terms ranging from six months to five years. 'ASB sees today's move by the governor of the Reserve Bank as a very positive initiative for the housing market and the economy in general,' said Hugh Burrett, managing director of ASB. Westpac also cut its floating interest rate by 0.50 percent to 10.45 percent. Earlier Kiwibank cut its variable home rate to 9.7 percent from 10.2 percent, to offer the lowest rate in the home loan market. ASB, owned by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and Westpac are two of New Zealand's top four banks, which are all Australian owned. The other two are ANZ-National Bank , and Bank of New Zealand, owned by National Australia Bank. Kiwibank, established in 2002 as a low-cost New Zealand-owned competitor to the main banks, is not reliant on offshore financing for its lending. Around 80 percent of New Zealand home loans are at a fixed rates, which the central bank said last year had diluted and delayed the impact of its interest rate rises. Earlier, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut its official cash rate by 50 basis points to 7.5 percent. Most forecasters had expected only a 25 basis point cut to 7.75 percent. RBNZ Governor Alan Bollard said part of the reason the central bank cut rates by more than expected was so that the retail banks could pass on relief to homeowners.
