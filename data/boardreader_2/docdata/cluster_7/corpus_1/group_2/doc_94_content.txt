  XL Leisure Group could still be successfully refinanced this week, despite entering into talks with its lenders after the process stalled.Sources close to the situation said that reports that the holiday group's refinancing plans had been delayed were premature, and the situation will be resolved this week.One industry insider close to XL said the situation was 'retrievable' and added that the fact that talks had been continuing for some time indicated that the 'consensus is that there is light at the end of the tunnel' for XL. XL's lenders, Barclays and Icelandic investment group Straumur, have been locked in negotiations over the weekend. Barclays is understood to have appointed restructuring specialist Kroll as an adviser.It is believed that XL is looking for a new lender after Barclays withdrew financing associated with fuel hedging positions last month.XL Leisure is Britain's third-largest holiday group behind TUI Travel and Thomas Cook. The group, which operates airline XL Airways and sells holidays under brands such as Freedom Flights, Medlife Hotels, Travel City Direct and Aspire, made an operating loss of 24m in its last financial year to October 2007.Figures filed at Companies House revealed that net liabilities increased from 8m to 59m during the period. The money owed to creditors grew from 114m to 205m.
