SYDNEY, Sept 9 (Reuters) - New Zealand's ASB Bank Ltd has set the rate on its NZ$270 million ($179.8 million) six-year notes at 8.22 percent, the bank, also the sole lead, said on Tuesday. The issue, initially launched with a size of NZ$50 million, was increased following a strong participation from retail and institutional investors. 'There was a strong retail appetite because of the fixed rate format and the fact we set the rate two days before an expected interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand,' said an ASB banker involved in the offer. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent at its policy meeting on Thursday. Breakdown details between retail and institutional investors were not released by ASB. ASB is owned by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia .
