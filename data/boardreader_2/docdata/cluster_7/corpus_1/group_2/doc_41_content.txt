More than one million Australian superannuation holders can breathe a sigh of relief on the news AIG has been bailed out, even as returns on their retirement investments sink.The impact on superannuation holders posed by US insurance giant AIG's looming failure appears to have passed after the US Federal Reserve said today the US government would take a majority stake in the company for $US85 billion ($107 billion). The threat of a collapsed AIG would have hit more than 1.3 million Australians, who hold AIG Life Australia insurance policies primarily in conjunction with superannuation accounts.''The Board determined that, in current circumstances, a disorderly failure of AIG could add to already significant levels of financial market fragility and lead to substantially higher borrowing costs, reduced household wealth, and materially weaker economic performance,'' the Fed said in a statement.However, the losses on shares look set to continue as the stocks continue their descent from a November 2007 high of 6828.7 points, losing 30% since that time.SuperRatings estimates this year's stock market plunge, which has been worsened by the recent collapse of Lehman Brothers, will translate into median balanced super funds losing 11.3% for the year.Losses on the sharemarkets at home and abroad, where the majority of superannuation funds equities investments lie, are ''flowing straight through to the super funds,'' said Jeff Bresnahan, managing director of SuperRatings.''It has had a much more material effect than as at the end of June.'' For the year to June, a balanced option superannuation fund lost 6.4%, according to SuperRatings.The S&amp;amp;P/ASX-200 is now down to March 2005 levels, closing at 4750 points yesterday, when it registered a 1.4% one-day drop.For the year to date, banks and insurance companies have lost more than one-third of their value as the global industry struggles through billions of dollars in write-offs tied to collapsing debt, according to data from Bloomberg.The main trouble for Australian superholders from AIG relate to the general weakness in shares, according to Andrew Keevers of fund research service Rainmaker Financial.The average Australian superannuation fund has a 5% direct exposure to US stocks amid a 20%-30% exposure to international equities in, he said.''There will definitely be a flow-on effect to Australian superannuation returns,'' Mr Keevers said of the recent drops in the sharemarket.In addition to the ''pure'' exposure to falling US-based equities, there's also the influence a plunging US stock market has on its Australian counterpart, which will keep returns in negative territory, he said.One area that may shield superannuation funds, Mr Keevers said, has been their investment in unlisted asset classes such as direct property.''The funds getting to the top of performing tables are the ones who have diversified some time ago into unlisted areas,'' he said, noting that some not-for-profits invested 10% to 15% in the category three-to-five years ago.
