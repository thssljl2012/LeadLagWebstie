AUSTRALIA'S 13th most-active broker, Lehman Brothers Australia, has been barred from trading on the Australian Securities Exchange as its US parent moves to file for bankruptcy, setting up world markets for a tumultuous week.Counterparties Citigroup Securities Clearing and Berndale Securities, owned by Merrill Lynch, have refused to deal with the investment bank's Australian arm any longer. The ASX yesterday imposed a suspension that will last at least a month.The Lehman Brothers collapse cast a shadow over Australian stocks yesterday, sending the sharemarket to its lowest point since January 2006.However, that was before confirmation of a merger between Bank of America and Merrill Lynch in a momentous $US50 billion ($61.6 billion) deal that will create the world's biggest brokerage.With little lead from Asia, where markets were closed in Japan, China and South Korea, the S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 pared its early losses, closing 1.8 per cent lower at 4817.7.Banking and financial stocks were hardest hit, with National Australia Bank falling by 4.8 per cent; Commonwealth Bank down by 2.3 per cent , ANZ 2.2 per cent lower and Westpac down by 1.6 per cent. Macquarie Group lost almost 5 per cent of its value, dropping to less than $40 a share.Investment bank Babcock &amp;amp; Brown, which was also hit by ANZ's decision to cut margin lending on the stock, fell a further 17 per cent to just $1.58 a share. 'NAB has been hit a little bit harder than the other domestic banks because there's still a belief NAB global operations may have exposure to offshore debt that some of the other domestic banks haven't got,' a senior dealer at CMC Markets, Dominic Vaughan, said. 'Macquarie - they're tarred with the same brush as Babcock, which is under pressure on the fact they are an investment bank.' Both NAB and Macquarie Bank said their exposure to Lehman was negligible.Lehman Brothers Australia's chief administration officer, Sean Moore, declined to comment on the parent company's announcement that it would file for bankruptcy in the US, but the jobs of 130 in staff Australian may be at risk.ANZ's head of international economics, Amy Auster, said there was now a big question mark over the US economic outlook. 'The real economic impact comes from what happens to the assets that are on [the Lehman Brothers] balance sheet,' she said. 'If the collapse forces a quick sale of its assets at ever-reduced prices, that's the sort of thing that starts to hit the economy.' with AAP
