While Dominion Finance Group goes into its receivership death throes, investors in stablemate North South Finance have been granted a lifeline to determine their own fate.Both property finance companies are owned by listed Dominion Finance Holdings, which is still trading.The finance group owes 6055 debenture holders $224 million, and North South Finance owes around 7000 investors about $100 million, with about a third of that owed to Bank of Scotland and ASB Bank.Both banks supported an orderly wind-down plan for North South Finance, essentially ruling out receivership, Graham Miller of trustee company Covenant Trustee said yesterday.Dominion Finance Group trustee Perpetual Trust appointed Rodney Pardington and Barry Phillips of Deloitte as receivers yesterday after an extensive review of the company.Perpetual chief executive Louise Edwards said a wind-down proposal from Dominion Finance Group had been considered but the statutory powers of receivers would ensure debenture holders' interests were best protected.However, the deputy chairman of Dominion Finance Group, Terry Butler, is leading an investor charge to overturn the receivership with the support of the board.Dominion Finance Holdings chairman Rick Bettle said receivership was not in the best interest of investors. 'A number of DFG stockholders have contacted the company to ask that they be given the opportunity to vote on the two alternatives.' Mr Butler believed he could also get the support of the Bank of Scotland, which held the 10 per cent of debentures needed to call an investor meeting.Perpetual Trust was told before it placed the company in receivership that Dominion Finance Group would be seeking to hold a meeting, Mr Butler said. It was 'bizarre' that sister company North South Finance's trustee, Covenant Trustee Company, had agreed to allow its investors to vote on a moratorium plan, rather than a receivership, he said. Dominion Finance Group put a moratorium proposal to the trustees on September 4 and had been at an advanced stage in preparing disclosure documents to be voted on by investors.North South Finance investors were expected to vote on their moratorium plan this month or early next month.Mr Miller of Covenant Trustee Company said the key to allowing North South Finance to proceed with a moratorium was a requirement that the process be supervised by insolvency specialists Korda Mentha. North South Finance's two independent directors, Mr Bettle and Vance Arkinstall, would remain on the board, and all other directors would resign.Receivers would send an initial report to investors as soon as possible.Shares in parent company Dominion Finance Holdings halved to 1 cent on the news.Shareholder funds of $46.5 million were wiped out to negative $70 million after the company dropped a bombshell last week by posting a $108 million loss for the year to March 31, against an expectation of an $8.95 million profit.It blamed a rapid deterioration of asset values after the balance date for the turnaround, which put the subsidiaries in breach of their banking commitments.Dominion Finance Holdings asset values fell from $485 million last year to $329 million at the end of August, against current liabilities of $360 million.It suspended repayments to investors in its two subsidiaries on June 17. An initial moratorium proposal was rejected by its bankers and trustees on August 22.Perpetual Trust and Covenant have acted as trustees for most of the failed finance companies. The trustees have come under fire for not asking more and tougher questions of finance companies.FACT FILE: Dominion Finance Group owes 6055 debenture holders $224 million. Stablemate North South Finance owes $100 million to about 7000 investors, who will vote on their moratorium in about three weeks.
