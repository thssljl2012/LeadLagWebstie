(Tim Sloan/AFP/)CANBERRAPrime Minister Kevin Rudd has warned that the deepening global financial crisis has a 'long way to run', but says he's determined to see Australia through what are significant challenges.The ongoing calamity in financial markets and growing casualty list associated with the credit crunch may, however, help Australians hoping for further interest rate relief in the months ahead.Minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) September board meeting show the decision to cut rates was a close call.The rate cut delivered on September 3 was the first cut in official rates in almost seven years and took the official cash rate to seven per cent.The elevated inflation outlook meant that 'policy could need to be on the restrictive side of normal for some time ahead', the minutes said.However, concerns that financial conditions had tightened more than was warranted, largely due to fallout from the global credit crunch, was enough to justify an easing of 25 basis points.'... there were also risks in waiting too long to have some easing of policy from a quite restrictive setting,' the minutes said.'In that event, demand could weaken more sharply than necessary.'This would deliver a faster reduction in inflation, but at greater short-term economic cost.'But the meeting took place two weeks before US investment banking giant Lehman Brothers joined a growing casualty list of companies caught out by the fallout from the collapse of the US sub-prime mortgage sector and subsequent credit crunch.Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy yesterday after failing to secure a rescue package.The company lost an estimated $4.76 billion in its fiscal third quarter amid fresh writedowns on mortgage assets.Two Australian banks have been listed in the bankruptcy notice as having $113 million worth of exposures.ANZ Banking Group is listed as having $85.3 million worth of exposures via two banks loans worth $54.4 million and $30.9 million.National Australia Bank is listed as having an exposure of $28.3 million via two letters of credit worth $15.5 million and $12.7 million.Australia's two biggest states, New South Wales and Victoria, were also trying to assess what exposure they might have to Lehman.Lehman's Wall Street rival Merrill Lynch, which was also close to collapse, was saved after a $61.04 billion takeover from Bank of America.There are now also concerns about the fate of US insurance giant American International Group (AIG).The Wall Street Journal has reported that AIG may be forced to file for bankruptcy, possibly as early as tomorrow, if it cannot secure billions of dollars in funding.As one of the world's biggest re-insurance companies, AIG's failure would have significant ramifications for insurance companies around the globe.The prime minister today warned the worsening crisis would continue for the foreseeable future.'We are in a period of global financial crisis, which has been running now since last year and it has become more intense,' Mr Rudd told parliament.'And as the events in the United States have demonstrated in the last 24 hours, regrettably, there's a long way to run yet.'Mr Rudd said the government was determined to prosecute a policy of responsible economic management to help see Australia through what he described as difficult global economic challenges.CommSec economist Craig James said the developments of the past few days meant there was now a greater likelihood of a rate cut in October.'A week or so ago, most people would have thought a rate cut in November was a more likely event, but a lot has changed in a short space of time,' Mr James said.'I think now the Reserve Bank would be more inclined to be cutting rates in October.'He said there were always risks on both sides of the equation.'But I think now it would be a case of leaning on the side of lower interest rates rather than rates remaining where they are, and that's because the balance of risks has shifted again.'
