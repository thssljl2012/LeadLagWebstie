Westpac and Commonwealth Bank will lower their variable home loan rate by 80 basis points, passing on most but not all of this afternoon's surprise decision by the Reserve Bank to cut the official cash rate by one percentage point.Westpac was first out of the blocks, announcing less than two hours after the RBA's move that it will lower its standard variable home loan rate by 0.8 of a percentage point, or 80 basis points, to 8.56%, effective October 13.Later in the afternoon, the Commonwealth Bank followed suit, saying that it was cutting its standard variable home loan rate also by 0.8 percentage points to 8.53% and its basic variable home loan from 8.82% to 8.02%, effective October 13 for new and existing customers.The RBA slashed the official cash rate by one percentage point, to 6%, its biggest cut in over 16 years and double the amount the market was expecting.The other major banks are still holding off on rate cuts, but are expected to follow soon, while non-bank lender Aussie Home Loans said it would take 75 basis points off its variable rate loans, also effective October 13.National Australia Bank said it would wait until markets calmed down before deciding on any cut in its standard variable rate in response to the RBA's surprise cut in the official cash rate.'When the market is calmer, we'll be in a better position to see how much we can pass on to our customers,'' National Australia Bank spokeswoman Luisa Ford said.ANZ Bank said it is reviewing its rates.'Westpac will continue to monitor the external environment, and our cost of funding position, and will look to pass on further interest rate reductions where possible,'' Westpac's head of retail and business banking Peter Hanlon said.'Since the beginning of September this year, term funding costs have increased to the highest levels seen since this crisis began over 12 months ago.''Westpac said about 50% of the bank's lending was funded with deposits, with the remaining 50 per cent of funding coming from short and long term borrowing in Australia and overseas.The bank said the cost of its funding base had increased materially over the past year, and most notably in the last few weeks.Commonwealth's head of retail banking services, Ross McEwan, said, the bank was reducing rates as much as possible, given the high wholesale and offshore funding costs.'While we are not reducing our variable home loan rates by as much as the RBA reduction, we do expect global financial markets to normalise over time and once that does occur we will be able to reduce rates by more than the RBA adjustments,' Mr McEwan said. 'Our customers can also expect out of cycle interest rate reductions.''
