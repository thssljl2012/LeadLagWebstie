Brisbane-based Suncorp-Metway says it is assessing whether to push ahead with the potential sale of its banking and wealth management arm following the Federal Government's decision to guarantee term funding for Australian banks.In the past week, Suncorp received separate approaches from Commonwealth Bank of Australia, ANZ and National Australia Bank for its banking operations and decided to test the market through a formal sales process.The move comes as CBA last week to acquired Perth-based BankWest for $2.1 billion, which represented just 0.8 times book value.Brokerage Citigroup placed a combined value of Suncorp's banking and funds operations at just over $8.2 billion, although this could be reduced to $6.8 billion by a full acquisition of Suncorp and a sell-down of its AAMI and GIO insurance business.As a smaller bank, Suncorp and several other small banks had found it tough to raise long-term wholesale financing. But with the Rudd Government this weekend providing a three-year guarantee on wholesale financing raised by banks, this essentially places Suncorp on an equal footing in term markets as a large bank. 'In light of the significant events in world financial markets over the last week and the Federal Governments's constructive initiatives for the financial sector announced yesterday, Suncorp is assessing the implications for the potential sale of its banking and wealth management operations,'' it said in a statement.Australian funding costs eased sharply this morning, with the premium charged to exchange floating- for fixed-rate interest payments in Australia for a period of one year shrank to 99 basis points, from 157 on Friday.Interbank lending seized up and funding costs had soared after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt last month, sapping confidence in global credit markets.Suncorp said it would hold talks with various parties and would update investors 'in due course''.
