 Three of Australia's biggest banks have cut their fixed home loan rates.But the drops will be of no benefit to customers who locked in interest rates amid fears they would rise rather than fall.Westpac, ANZ and National Australia Bank today announced a drop in fixed rates for home loan products.Westpac, which is awaiting Treasurer Wayne Swan's approval for its merger with St George Bank, was the first to cut fixed rates by up to 1.1 percentage points this morning.According to a Westpac statement, the mortgage provider now has the most competitive fixed rate in the market for three-year mortgages with a rate of 6.99%. Westpac also cut its one, four and five-year fixed rate mortgage rates to 7.19 per cent.National Australia Bank also confirmed it would lower its fixed home loan rates - by up to 1.6 percentage points. 'Combined with our competitive variable rates, this gives our customers the benefit of locking in some certainty during these economically volatile times,' NAB's Australia chief executive Ahmed Fahour said in a statement.The ANZ also cut fixed home loan rates, bringing its two, three and four-year loans down to 7.69%.The Commonwealth Bank's fixed rates are under review.
