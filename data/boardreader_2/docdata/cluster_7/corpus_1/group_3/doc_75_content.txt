While superannuation funds are struggling in the face of the massive upheaval in financial markets, the federal government's Future Fund is holding its own.It has posted a positive 1.5 per cent return in the 2007-08 financial year, and has since made only a minor negative return of 0.2 per cent in the September quarter, Finance Minister Lindsay Tanner revealed.While this is well shy of its target of inflation plus 4.5 to 5.5 per cent over the long term, compare that to the median negative return of over six per cent for super funds for the last financial year. 'This is a very significant and positive result in the circumstances the Future Fund has been dealing with, given the huge drops in share prices, not only in Australian markets but also internationally,' Mr Tanner told parliament.The value of the Fund stood at $63.4 billion, including around $8.2 billion in Telstra shares, as of September 30, 2008.The secret to its relative success is that 62 per cent of its portfolio remains in cash and it also had low exposure to a recent bout of global banking failures, such as former financial giant Lehman Brothers. 'It is worth noting late last year the board of the Future Fund made a very sound decision that it would proceed slowly into the equities market, given that in its assessment at the time, the equities market was very fully priced,' Mr Tanner said. 'That proved to be a very sound decision.' The fund, set up by the Howard government to pay for previously uncovered public servants super liabilities, became operational in financial markets last year.The announcement came as the local market showed a rare defiance to a fall on Wall Street, ending around four per cent higher.The rally was led by the resources sector on gains in copper and oil prices, and despite ominous signs that its main exporting destination - China - is beginning to feel the pinch from the global financial crisis.China's economic growth slowed to 9.9 per cent in the first three quarters of 2008, down from 10.4 per cent in the first half of 2008, and 12.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2007. 'The growth rate of the world economy slowed down noticeably. There are more uncertain and volatile factors in the international economic climate,' Li Xiaochao, the National Bureau of Statistics spokesman said in a statement. 'All these factors have started to release their negative impact on China's economy.' Anticipating that a global economic slowdown will badly damage Australian growth has made this week's key inflation numbers almost irrelevant, even though they are showing extreme price pressures.Prices paid by business accelerated at their fastest pace in at least a decade in the September quarter, although slower economic growth will temper these pressures going forward, economists say.The producer price index at the final stage of production jumped by 2.0 per cent in the September quarter, double expectations, for an annual rate of 5.6 per cent, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said.Wednesday's consumer price index is expected to show the annual rate at close to five per cent, way beyond the Reserve bank of Australia's (RBA) two to three per cent inflation target band.Wholesale interest rate markets are now predicting the RBA will cut its cash rate by a half percentage point to 5.5 per cent next month, rather than three-quarters of a point as market pricing previously suggested.Commonwealth Bank cut its variable mortgage rate by 21 basis points on Monday, following on the heels of reductions made by ANZ, National Australia Bank and Aussie Home Loans in the past few days. 'Independent lowering on lending rates from some financial institutions suggests that funding pressures are abating and that wholesale financial conditions are improving, albeit glacially,' TD Securities senior strategist Joshua Williamson said.
