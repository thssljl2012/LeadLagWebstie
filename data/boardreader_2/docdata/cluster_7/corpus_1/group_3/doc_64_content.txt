Banks may not cut deposit rates if RBA lowers official rates Australian households have $300bn in bank deposits  WORRIED Australians have sunk $30 billion in cash into deposit accounts in the past six months - a trend the banks are aggressively encouraging as they seek to bolster balance sheets eroded by the global financial crisis.Banks are so desperate to build up deposits to offset the unmovable debt on their balance sheets and reduce their reliance on frozen credit markets, which have brought dozens of global banks to their knees, that it is considered unlikely they will apply next week's full interest rate cut to deposit accounts, leaving many paying more than 8 per cent interest,  There are hopes that Washington's $US700 billion ($895billion) bailout package, which was passed into law today, will flood credit markets with liquidity, helping banks raise crucial funds. But in the meantime, it is cheaper for banks to pay customers annual interest rates of 8 per cent -- a 13-year high - than raise money on markets demanding double-digit rates depending on the strength of the individual institution. The rush to park investments in cash coincides with the collapse of confidence in global stock markets and depressed property markets, with ordinary investors and superannuation funds shifting tens of billions of dollars into cash holdings since the start of the year. Last month's Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey of consumer sentiment revealed that nearly 30 per cent of households viewed bank deposits as the wisest place for savings -- the highest in more than 15 years. Figures reveal that the nation's households now have $300 billion sitting in bank deposit accounts - up from $270 billion in February - with the Commonwealth Bank and ANZ winning the trust of most customers. Superannuation funds are sitting on another $143 billion in cash investments - up from $110 billion at the start of the year - taking the percentage of their total portfolios held in cash from 11.5 per cent to almost 15 per cent as they shun chaotic stock markets.
