ustralia &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., the second-worst performing Australian bank stock this year, posted its first decline in annual profit in 11 years after provisions for delinquent loans almost quadrupled. Net income fell 21 percent to A$3.32 billion ($2.24 billion) in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, from A$4.18 billion a year earlier, the Melbourne-based bank said in a statement today. That compared with a A$3.15 billion median estimate of 16 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Chief Executive Officer Mike Smith's plan to double earnings by 2012 through acquisitions in Asia is being undermined at home as Australia's 17-year economic expansion loses steam and bad loans rise. The bank increased provisions after rising borrowing costs and plunging stock markets sparked the collapse of Australian margin lenders backed by the bank including Opes Prime Group Ltd. Shares of ANZ have slumped 31 percent in 2008, the second- biggest decline on the 7-company index of Australia's biggest banks. National Australia Bank Ltd., which posted a 24 drop in second-half earnings this week, has dropped the most. Provisions for credit impairment jumped to A$1.95 billion from A$522 million in the year-earlier period, the bank said today.
