WELLINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Inflation in New Zealand hit its highest annual rate in 18 years in the third quarter, but its move further above the central bank's target band will not delay an aggressive rate cut later this week. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.5 percent in the three months to Sept. 30, to be 5.1 percent higher than a year earlier, according to official data on Tuesday. Economists in a Reuters poll forecast the CPI to rise 1.5 percent on the previous quarter and the annual rate by 5.1 percent. **************************************************************** KEY POINTS: - Q3 CPI rise driven by higher petrol, housing and food costs. - Nine of 11 sub groups rise, with clothng and telecommunications only groups to fall. - Non-tradables inflation, goods and services not facing foreign competition, rose 1.3 percent from Q2 and 4.1 percent on a year ago. - The central bank, which must keep annual inflation between 1 and 3 percent over the medium term, forecast Q3 rise of 1.3 percent and 4.9 percent annual rate. - Food price index, which makes up 17.8 pct of CPI, rises 0.6 percent in September. Annual rate up 10.8 pct, highest since April 1990. - Click on for full table COMMENTARY: CRAIG EBERT, SENIOR ECONOMIST, BNZ 'The interest is in the detail of it. Some of those domestically driven indicators, the trimmed mean, the non-tradables and the proportion of prices going up, are all higher than expected. It doesn't change the view that inflation has peaked, but maybe the starting point is a little more robust than people thought. 'In that sense, it doesn't change what the Reserve Bank is going to be doing, but it just leaves us a little bit more comfortable picking the 75 point rate cut as opposed to the 100.' SU-LIN ONG, SENIOR ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS 'The result was in line with forecasts but still higher than what the RBNZ had estimated. The core measures all took a step up, with non-tradeble prices showing the biggest rise since September 2000. So it's clear price pressures are broad-based. 'Yet this is probably the peak for inflation, and with the economy in a recessionary state it should decline from here. That means it won't stop the RBNZ from cutting rates, though at the margin it might affect the pace of easing. We're still looking for 75 basis points this week, with a chance they go the full 100.' KHOON GOH, SENIOR ECONOMIST, ANZ-NATIONAL BANK 'No surprises in this data. Underlying inflation is still elevated, but this could be the usual lag between slowing domestic demand starting to curb inflation pressures. Looking ahead, inflation is vastly improved given the deteriorating economy and falling commodity prices, so today's data won't get in the way of an aggressive easing from the RBNZ on Thursday.' ROBIN CLEMENTS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, UBS 'Broadly in line, with the factors behind it such as food and petrol pretty much as anticipated, so it keeps us on track for an interest rate cut on Thursday. 'Inflation is old news to the extent we've seen petrol prices falling and food and commodity prices coming off, so I think the Reserve Bank can have greater confidence that headline and underlying inflation is going to fall.' STEPHEN HALMARICK, CO-HEAD OF MARKET ECONOMICS, CITI 'This is in line with market expectations. Even with headline inflation at 5 percent, we still expect the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) to cut rates by 100 basis points at their next meeting as the outlook for the global economy has deteriorated. We expect inflation to fall in the coming months, given the economy is in recession.' MARKET REACTION: - The New Zealand dollar slipped to around $0.6195/02 from around $0.6204/12 before the data. The yield on the December bank bill futures contract slipped to 6.35 percent from 6.37 before the announcement. The official cash rate is 7.50 percent.

It said it expected high inflation to ease in the face of the sharply slowing economy and international financial turmoil. - Twelve of 16 analysts in the latest Reuters poll expect the central bank to cut its cash rate by 100 basis points to 6.5 percent on Thursday. - The NZ Institute of Economic Research's third quarter survey of business opinion showed capacity utilisation, or the level of use of resources in the economy, easing to 90.8 from 92.4 percent. The survey also showed business sentiment rebounding from a 33-year low, with a net 28 percent expecting to raise prices in the next three months from 49 percent in the previous survey. - The economy shrank 0.2 percent in the second quarter, less than expected but confirming that New Zealand's economy is in its first recession in more than a decade. The third quarter is also expected to show a contraction, before a return to slight growth. - Latest data from government agency Quotable Value and industry group Real Estate Institute of NZ showed house prices are falling on the same period a year ago.copying, republication or redistribution of Thomson Financial News Content, including by framing or similar means, is expressly prohibited without the prior written consent of Thomson Financial News.
