A CoreData report found roughly 2,000 mortgage brokers believe they will change broking groups in the next year as big banks cut commissions and continue to squeeze them out of the industry.The study of 700 Australian mortgage brokers revealed two thirds felt banks are trying to squeeze them out of the industry and a quarter believed the banks move to cut commissions was severely affecting their business.Only a quarter of respondents said the past 12 months activity had been better than the previous corresponding period and almost a quarter of brokers said they considered ceasing to offer loan broking services in the past year.However some optimism within the industry remains, with more than 63 per cent of brokers expecting consumer demand for mortgage broking to increase.This pressure is forcing brokers to assess their options. The report found more than 30 per cent considered changing their broking group in the past 12 months and 13 per cent or roughly 2,000 brokers said they would change in the next year.Brokers may feel threatened by banks, but the report found they're still writing a lot of business through them, with Commonwealth Bank and ANZ identified as the most popular loan books in the industry holding a combined 22 per cent of all loans.The existence of the mortgage broking industry hinges on its ability to promote its brand, deliver a high level of broker service and provide an extensive product range, CoreData noted.
