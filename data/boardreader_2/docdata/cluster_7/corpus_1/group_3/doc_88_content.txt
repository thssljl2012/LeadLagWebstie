(Adds detail)CANBERRA, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The Australian government approved the nation's biggest bank takeover on Thursday, allowing Westpac Banking Corp  to buy smaller rival St George Bank , saying the union would strengthen local banking.Treasurer Wayne Swan approved the A$16 billion ($10.74 billion) deal, which combines Australia's fourth- and fifth- largest lenders, on grounds of national interest and amid the biggest global financial crisis since the Great Depression. 'The merged entity will have a larger balance sheet and capital base as well as broader access to funding markets, making it better placed to withstand systemic shocks,' Swan said. 'The St George banking brand will also benefit from Westpac's lower funding costs, helping it to offer lower interest rates on loans,' he added in a statement.The deal would create Australia's second-largest bank with total assets of A$500.6 billion, behind National Australia Bank (NAB)  with A$564.6 billion, Thomson Reuters data shows.Australia has a policy that bans mergers among the four major banks -- NAB, Commonwealth Bank , ANZ Banking Group  and Westpac -- in order to ensure market competition.But the St George deal fell outside the so-called 'four pillars' policy and has already been cleared by the competition watchdog, which said it was unlikely to lessen competition.This month, the government extended a blanket state guarantee to Australian banks' deposits and wholesale funding, arguing that local banks could be disadvantaged in capital markets if they did not have similar state guarantees as their foreign rivals.The government says Australian banks are well regulated and well capitalised.Westpac's acquisition of St George still needs to be approved by the latter's shareholders at a meeting scheduled for Nov. 13.($1=A$1.49) (Reporting by James Grubel, Editing by Mark Bendeich)
