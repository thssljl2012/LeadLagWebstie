(The Age - ABIX via COMTEX) -- CBAUF   Quote   Chart   News   PowerRating -- Australian-listed allfinanz group Suncorp-Metway is now less likely to proceed with a planned divestment. It had received initial interest in its banking and fund management operations from Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank and ANZ Banking, but only the latter ended up making an offer, which was at the lower end of the scale. However, the Federal Government's move to guarantee bank deposits in order to bolster the sector has given Suncorp reason to pause and reconsider the sale. As a result, its shares closed 2.3% lower at $A9.05 in an otherwise much stronger market on 13 October 2008.Publication Date: 14 October 2008SUNCORP-METWAY LIMITED - ASX SUN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND BANKING GROUP LIMITED - ASX ANZ NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LIMITED - ASX NAB COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA - ASX CBA GOLDMAN SACHS JBWERE PTY LTD LAZARD CARNEGIE WYLIE PTY LTD UBS AUSTRALIA LIMITEDFor full details for CBAUF click here.More News:  Market Updates   Stock Alerts   All Trading News   Stock Index
