Insurance and banking group Suncorp-Metway is considering its options on a possible sale of its banking and wealth management unit, amid a report that it had shelved sale plans.A Suncorp spokesman said the company would have talks with various parties in coming days, though it was assessing the implications of extreme market turbulence.'We expect to have talks with various parties in coming days and will provide an update to the market,'' he said.Suncorp shares jumped 4.75% to $9.71 in early trade, in line with the general market's rise.The group said on October 6 it had received approaches for its banking and wealth management operations.Before last week's market slide, analysts had put valuations on the combined businesses ranging from $5 billion to $8 billion.The Australian Financial Review said today Suncorp-Metway had scrapped plans to sell its banking and asset management divisions after receiving just one low-ball offer.The paper, in an unsourced report, said Suncorp was reconsidering its plans after Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) and National Australia Bank failed to lodge bids by Suncorp's Friday deadline.A bid from Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd was believed to have been pitched below the value of Suncorp's net tangible assets, the paper added.'It is understood ANZ's offer was by way of a scheme of arrangement, making it subject to a shareholder vote, and its valuation method would have been in line with CBA's $2.1 billion bid for BankWest, but well below broker valuations,'' it said.CBA last week announced a deal to buy troubled British bank HBOS's Australian operation, BankWest, and also said it had had exploratory talks with Suncorp.That followed Suncorp saying it had received several approaches for its banking and wealth management operations.Analysts have valued those operations at up to $5 billion, but that was before last week's market turmoil slashed bank valuations. The paper cited industry sources as saying Suncorp's board had met on Sunday to discuss whether an Australian government assistance package to lenders might give it more scope to retain the banking division.The credit crunch has sharply reduced Suncorp's access to financing. In August, it reported a 47.7% drop in year profit.
