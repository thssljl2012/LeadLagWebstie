AUSTRALIAN banks have embraced Kevin Rudd's blanket guarantee on deposits and praised initiatives to help them compete for funding in international markets.The Prime Minister yesterday announced three key measures to assist Australian banks, saying he would not allow them to be disadvantaged while 'less well-regulated' and 'poorly managed' foreign banks were propped up around the world.The Government will guarantee loans taken by Australian banks in international wholesale markets, which are used to fund mortgages and commercial loans.It will guarantee all deposits held in Australian financial institutions for three years, instead of introducing legislation it initially proposed to cover the first $20,000 of individuals' deposits.And it will double the amount of money allocated to promote competition in the Australian mortgage market, providing up to $8 billion in funding for banks and non-deposit-taking institutions.'Usually we would say that the banks are well regulated and well capitalised and that such steps would not be necessary,' a spokeswoman for National Australia Bank said.But both NAB and ANZ welcomed the Prime Minister's announcement, because of the extreme market conditions that have sent global sharemarkets into meltdown.Credit unions praised the Government's 'decisive move' to guarantee deposits.'We think it's going to be a real confidence builder for the Australian community,' said Louise Petschler, chief executive of the credit union industry body, Abacus Australian Mutuals. 'But we don't think it's likely to be used.'Australian Bankers Association chief executive David Bell said there was never any suggestion that deposits were at risk.Other countries, including Ireland, Germany and Greece, have already taken steps to guarantee all deposits.At the weekend, finance ministers from the G7 group of industrialised nations published a plan of action that noted the need for deposit insurance as they attempt to 'stabilise financial markets and restore the flow of credit'.
