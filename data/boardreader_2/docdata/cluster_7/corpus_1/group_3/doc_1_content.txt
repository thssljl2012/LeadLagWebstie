Westpac will lower its variable home loan rate by 80 basis points, in the first move by a major bank after this afternoon's surprise decision by the Reserve Bank to cut the official cash rate by one percentage point.The bank said it will lower its standard variable home loan rate by 0.8 of a percentage point, or 80 basis points, to 8.56%, effective October 13, passing on most but not all of the RBA's rate cut.Westpac's announcement comes less than two hours after the RBA slashed the official cash rate by one percentage point, to 6%, its biggest cut in over 16 years.The other major banks are still holding off on rate cuts, but are expected to follow soon, while non-bank lender Aussie Home Loans said it would take 75 basis points off its variable rate loans, also effective October 13.National Australia Bank said it would wait until markets calmed down before deciding on any cut in its standard variable rate in response to the RBA's surprise cut in the official cash rate.'When the market is calmer, we'll be in a better position to see how much we can pass on to our customers,'' National Australia Bank spokeswoman Luisa Ford said.Commonwealth Bank and ANZ Bank said they were reviewing their rates.'Westpac will continue to monitor the external environment, and our cost of funding position, and will look to pass on further interest rate reductions where possible,'' Westpac's head of retail and business banking Peter Hanlon said.'Since the beginning of September this year, term funding costs have increased to the highest levels seen since this crisis began over 12 months ago.''Westpac said about 50% of the bank's lending was funded with deposits, with the remaining 50 per cent of funding coming from short and long term borrowing in Australia and overseas.The bank said the cost of its funding base had increased materially over the past year, and most notably in the last few weeks.Aussie Home Loans director John Symond said home loan lenders are likely to pass on three-quarters of today's official interest rate cut to borrowers. The lender said it would cut its variable home loan rate by 0.75 of a percentage point, or 75 basis points.Mr Symond said the RBA move was good news for home borrowers who can expect to see most of the cut passed on to them.'It's a bold move that signals just how serious the global credit crunch is and the RBA has to be commended with this bold move,'' Mr Symond told Sky News.The Housing Industry Association said the cut provided a glimmer of hope for both mortgage holders and aspiring first home buyers.The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its key rate to six per cent from seven per cent, its biggest cut in over 16 years.Falling interest rates over the next year may provide some assistance in pegging the gap between underlying and effective demand for housing, HIA policy chief executive Chris Lamont said.'Housing affordability remains far too low,'' he said. 'Increases in interest rates were the final straw for many current and aspiring home buyers - rate cuts will provide some necessary relief.''He said notwithstanding uncertainties in the economy, further rate cuts over the next 12 months would provide greater opportunities for Australians to get into home ownership.'Put simply, if you can afford to get into a home of your own don't delay,'' he said.He said a full percentage point reduction in mortgage interest rates over time meant a saving of $215 per month on a $300,000 mortgage, or almost $2600 per annum.
