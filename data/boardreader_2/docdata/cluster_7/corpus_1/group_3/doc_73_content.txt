Australian stocks are expected to open mixed or slightly lower today after W Street rejected Europe's positive lead and closed the week lower amid volatile trading.AMP Investments chief economist Shane Oliver said Friday night futures trading suggested a f of about 20 points was likely for the local bourse today.However, CommSec chief economist Craig James pointed to a range of positive and negative influences, including Friday's ry on European equity markets, a lower gold price and higher oil and base metal prices.''There's a lot of value in our market,'' Mr James said.''We've seen the price-earnings ratio f to the lowest level in almost 30 years.''Some market reaction to mortgage interest rate cuts made by ANZ Banking Group and Aussie Home Loans at the weekend was also on the cards for today's session, he said.On Friday, ANZ announced a 25-basis-point cut to its standard variable mortgage rate, saying the cost of wholesale funding was easing.On Saturday, Aussie Home Loans said it was dropping its standard variable home loan rate by 30 basis points to 7.79 per cent for first-home buyers after the Federal Government announced further assistance to first-home buyers.After wild swings on Friday that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise 300 points and then trade 260 points to the downside, the Dow finished 127.04 points lower at 8852.22.The broader Standard and Poor's 500 index dropped 5.88 points at 940.55, while the tech-laden Nasdaq composite lost 6.42 points to 1711.29.Resources and banking stocks weighed down the Australian sharemarket on Friday, with the benchmark S&amp;amp;P/ASX200 index closing 42.6 points, or 1.06 per cent lower, at 3970.8. The broader  Ordinaries Index lost 43.3 points to 3944.8.Mr James said Australian investors were still facing ''jittery times'' and probably an interest rate cut of at least 50 basis points when the Reserve Bank of Australia met next month.''The inflation figures are rey a yesterday issue because now the focus is on growth.'' Monetary policy needed to boost the economy and so the official cash rate should be below 5 per cent, he said.''I think the RBA will try to get rates below 5 per cent fairly quickly: it could be as much as 75 basis points cut in November and then the remainder in December. So I think by Christmas we'll see a cash rate of around about 5 per cent or a little bit below.''RBA governor Glenn Stevens will address the American Chamber of Commerce in Sydney tomorrow after the RBA issues minutes from its October 7 board meeting.Mr James said this week saw China's '' important'' September-quarter GDP data issued as well as a host of earnings reports from the United States.Other events on the diary this week include the issuing today of the Australian Bureau of Statistics' producer price indices for the September quarter.Tomorrow, the National Australia Bank will unveil its full-year results for 2008 and Woolworths will issue its September-quarter sales report.Thursday will be dominated by the Housing Industry Association and Commonwealth Bank housing affordability report for the September quarter and ANZ Banking Group's 2008 result.
