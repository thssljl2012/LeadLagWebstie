COMMONWEALTH Bank will push ahead with talks to acquire Suncorp-Metway's banking operations, even as the banking giant is poised to announce a $2 billion-plus acquisition of BankWest as early as today.The acquisition represents the first significant deal for CBA chief executive Ralph Norris, delivering the bank a dominant share of the nation's mortgage and corporate lending markets as well as becoming the biggest player in credit cards.The bank will hold just over 21% of Australia's deposits, just behind a combined Westpac and St George.The move underscores how rapidly the banking landscape is being reshaped by the global financial crisis, with major banks tightening their grip on lending markets.Priced at just over $2 billion, the deal is close to BankWest's net tangible assets and includes its St Andrew's insurance and wealth management arm. The cash transaction is expected to be partly funded through an accelerated rights issue.BankWest's owner, the troubled British mortgage giant HBOS, has substantially softened its position on a sale, allowing CBA to cherry pick the best parts of its Australian operations  the core retail banking and wealth management operations.CBA had previously threatened to walk away, based on HBOS' previous insistence for an all-or-nothing transaction that also involved the $15.6 billion BOS International corporate book and $12 billion asset finance book.These two businesses are largely unfunded and are most vulnerable to lending losses during an economic slowdown.The fast-paced consolidation of regional banking comes just days after Brisbane-based Suncorp moved ahead with a formal sales process of its banking business.Over the past week, Suncorp has received separate approaches from CBA, ANZ and National Australia Bank for its banking operations and has decided to test the market through a formal sales process.Brokerage Citigroup placed a combined value of Suncorp's banking and funds operations at just over $8.2 billion, although this could be reduced to $6.8 billion by a full acquisition of Suncorp and a sell-down of its AAMI and GIO insurance business.
