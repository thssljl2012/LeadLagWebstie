MORE relief has been passed on to home owners, with the National Australia Bank clipping its interest rates by 0.2 per cent.Last night's cut comes 48 hours after the ANZ shocked the market by trimming its loan rates by 0.25 per cent, a move that caught rival banks napping.It is widely expected the Commonwealth, Westpac and St George will follow with similar cuts today in a bid to stay competitive.Aussie Home Loans became the first non-bank lender to respond to ANZ's move on Saturday, slashing its variable rate by 0.3 per cent.The extra cut by Aussie, as well as the 0.9 per cent cut by RAMS Home Loans earlier this month, proves that strength is finally returning to a non-bank sector that had virtually ground to a halt during the credit crunch.NAB executive director and CEO Ahmed Fahour said the surprise round of rate cuts was made possible by the falling cost of credit and the Federal Government's guarantee of bank deposits.The latest cut, which comes into effect on October 27, will see NAB's variable rate sitting at 8.36 per cent, compared to ANZ's new rate of 8.32 per cent. Westpac's variable rate is 8.56 per cent while St George's is 8.57 per cent.NAB says its full October rate cut of 1 per cent will save home owners $1000 for every $100,000 of their loan, every year.  What is this?
