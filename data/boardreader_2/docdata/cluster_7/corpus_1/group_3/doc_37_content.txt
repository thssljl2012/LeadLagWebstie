THE Commonwealth Bank of Australia will push ahead with talks to acquire Suncorp Metway's banking operations even though it is set to announce a $2 billion-plus acquisition of BankWest as early as today.The acquisition represents the first significant deal for the bank's chief executive, Ralph Norris, delivering it a dominant share of the nation's mortgage and corporate lending markets as well as becoming the biggest player in credit cards. It will also hold just over 21 per cent of Australia's deposits, close behind a combined Westpac and St George.It underscores how fast the banking landscape is being reshaped by the global financial crisis, with banks tightening their grip on lending markets.Priced at just over $2 billion, the deal is close to BankWest's net tangible assets and includes its St Andrew's insurance and wealth management arm. The cash transaction is expected to be partly-funded through an accelerated rights issue.BankWest's owner, the troubled British mortgage giant HBOS, has softened its position on a sale, allowing the Commonwealth to cherry pick the best parts of its Australian operations - the core retail banking and wealth management operations.The CBA had threatened to walk away based on HBOS' previous insistence for an all-or-nothing transaction that also involved the $15.6 billion BOS International corporate book and $12 billion asset finance book.The fast-paced consolidation of regional banking comes just days after Brisbane's Suncorp moved ahead with a formal sale process of its banking business.Over the past week it had approaches from CBA, ANZ and National Australia Bank for its banking operations. Brokerage Citigroup placed a combined value of Suncorp's banking and funds operations at just over $8.2 billion. Despite a move on BankWest, it is understood CBA remains committed to acquiring the Suncorp assets, with an eye to boosting its presence in the high-growth Queensland market.However, it is likely to run into competition hurdles if it pushes ahead with such a transaction.For CBA, BankWest delivers it a dominant share of the fast-growing West Australian market. The one-time government-owned bank has more than 26 per cent of lending and controls a third of the state's deposits. By folding BankWest into CBA, analysts say, CBA could generate about $200 million in annual synergies. The acquisition will deliver an additional $55.4 billion in mortgages and corporate loans to CBA's $380 billion lending book.After months of on-and-off talks, the Credit Suisse-advised CBA yesterday said that it had moved into exclusive negotiation on BankWest with HBOS.It is believed final legal moves have been a stumbling point, given HBOS is itself being acquired by British banking giant Lloyds TSB. To satisfy regulators and keep customers onside, CBA is expected to keep BankWest's brand and branches, although the regional bank's east coast expansion will be reduced.With Mathew Murphy
