The Commonweath Bank has followed ANZ and National Australia Bank (NAB) by cutting variable mortgage interest rates.Citing a fall in the cost of funding, the bank - which is Australia's biggest home lender - lowered rates by 0.21 basis points today. The move follows NAB's announcement that it is cutting variable rates by 20 basis points. ANZ was first to lower rates, announcing a 25 basis point cut last Friday. NAB, ANZ and CBA have now passed on the whole of the Reserve Bank's surprise 1 percent rate cut, announced earlier this month. 'We have seen some reduction in our cost of funding over the past week and as Australia's biggest lender, the Commonwealth Bank is committed to remaining extremely competitive in the mortgage market,' said Ross McEwan, group executive, retail banking services, at CBA. Annoucing NAB's rate cut yesterday, Ahmed Fahour, the bank's Australia chief executive, praised the recent move by the government to guarantee wholesale bank lending amid the worsening financial crisis. 'While our current cost of funds remain at a historical high, policy measures announced by the Australian Government earlier this month have started to have a positive impact on the credit market,' he said. 'We welcome this new development and anticipate that we will see some relief in the significantly higher premium we are currently paying for wholesale funds. Should this be the case, then we hope to be in a position where we can pass on further interest rate cuts to our customers.' The Reserve Bank meets again on November 4 and while some economists expect a rate cut, others suggest the recent stimulus package and lingering inflationary pressures may lead the central bank to stay put for now.
