BANKS have failed to embrace the Rudd Government's home saver accounts, with only two of Australia's major banks offering the accounts on the first day of the scheme.Westpac and NAB say they have no plans to offer the accounts, which would give people saving for a first home tax breaks and government contributions up to $1000 a year on a $5000 deposit.Commonwealth Bank and ANZ launched their accounts yesterday, but have been criticised for offering low rates of interest compared to their other savings accounts and imposing tough conditions.A spokesman for Consumer group Choice, Christopher Zinn, said the Commonwealth Bank's rate of 6.5% fell below the official cash rate of 7%, and interest was credited annually rather than monthly.ANZ offered an interest rate of only 0.01% for months when contributions were less than $10.'Some institutions are offering interest above the (official cash) rate, and it will be interesting to see how they move when the RBA cuts rates,' Mr Zinn said.'There are fair and simple ways to calculate interest and there are sneaky ways. These first home savers' accounts aren't foolproof.'He said the fact only 17 financial institutions had set up accounts reflected a relatively low level of demand.'Several banks said there was a relatively narrow target market for the account, the cost of establishing the account was too great and the costs of compliance would be greater than any potential benefits,' he said.National Institute of Accountants CEO Roger Cotton agreed that compliance costs and low demand were likely factors in low take-up.'A lot of the product or business unit people in the banks would reckon it's all too much work for little consumer uptake; we can make more money on other things,' he said.
