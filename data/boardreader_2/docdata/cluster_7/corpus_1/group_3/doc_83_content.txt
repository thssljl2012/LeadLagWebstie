SYDNEY, Australia-Australia &amp;amp; New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., reeling from the fallout of the global credit crisis, on Thursday reported a 21 percent loss in annual profit.Net income plunged to 3.3 billion Australian dollars (US$2.2 billion) in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, from A$4.2 billion (US$2.8 billion) a year earlier, the Melbourne-based bank said in a statement.The results, ANZ's first profit fall since 1998, were impacted by a A$1.4 billion (US$941 million) increase in credit impairment charges on lending to A$1.9 billion (US$1.3 billion) and a A$700 million (US$470 million) charge for credit risk on derivatives.Chief executive Mike Smith called the growth in credit losses 'disappointing,' but said the bank's 'ability to manage and absorb this shows a high level of resilience.' 'While we expect choppy conditions to continue in 2009, ANZ is well positioned to manage this cycle, to continue to invest and maximize the opportunities which arise,' Smith told reporters.Revenue was up four percent to A$11.5 billion (US$7.7 billion).
