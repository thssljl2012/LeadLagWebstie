SYDNEY, Oct 20 (Reuters) - National Australia Bank (NAB) has followed rival Australia and New Zealand Banking Group NAB's move, announced on Sunday, has raised expectations that the other three major domestic banks -- Commonwealth Bank NAB, the country's largest lender, and ANZ cut their standard variable mortgage rates by 0.20 percent and 0.25 percent, respectively, after the government guaranteed their deposits and wholesale funding in response to the global financial crisis. Both banks have now fully passed on the central bank's shock 1 percentage point rate cut of early this month. 'That (the government guarantee) has improved their funding position, so I think the quid pro quo is they start to respond by cutting interest rates,' said Rohan Walsh, investment manager at Karara Capital. 'It would be quite negative from a customer perspective if they didn't,' he added, noting that credit spreads had improved, and margins were looking better. The RBA is expected to cut rates again next month, but Australian bill futures tumbled on Monday on speculation the RBA might not cut as aggressively as many investors expect.
