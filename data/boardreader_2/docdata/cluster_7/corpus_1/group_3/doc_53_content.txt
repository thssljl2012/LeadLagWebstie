The number of jobs advertised fell in September, for the fifth consecutive month, foreshadowing a rise in unemployment as global growth slows.Jobs advertised online and in newspapers fell 1.4% in September to an average of 245,734 per week. In trend terms, total job ads fell 1.8% in September. However, the total number of ads in September was 2.2% lower than a year earlier, according to ANZ Bank, which prepares the monthly survey.The weaker annualised number suggests the demand for new workers may be softening, as reduced domestic demand and a grim outlook abroad erodes the labour market. 'The latest result indicates that hiring intentions continue to soften through the second half of 2008 and eventually this will show up as a weakening of employment growth and a rise in the unemployment rate,' ANZ head of Australian economics, Warren Hogan, said in a release. 'ANZ has revised forecasts for unemployment in Australia and now expects the unemployment rate to rise to around 5% over the second half of 2009.' The unemployment rate was 4.3% in September, although in recent months several companies have announced lay-offs including Qantas, Insurance Australia Group and GM Holden.czappone@fairfax.com.auBusinessDay
