Expectations of a 100 basis point cut to the Official Cash Rate this Thursday combined with reports that the crisis in credit markets is slowly abating point to a strong start for the New Zealand sharemarket this morning.The New York Dow Jones Industrial index closed unofficially up 411.46 points or 4.65%, which is usually a reliable indicator for the direction of New Zealand shares.Meanwhile the ANZ Bank reports that interbank lending rates have fallen, with the US 3 month LIBOR down over one-third of a per cent to 4.06% - the largest fall in the last nine months.While the level is still high, it is off the panic driven extremes of the last quarter and the downwards direction has boosted market sentiment.The huge central bank liquidity injections, capital measures and government guarantees appear to be gradually thawing frozen money markets, with attention starting to turn towards real economies.Major economists are in consensus; markets have priced in a 100 basis point cut to the OCR, with many not ruling out a more aggressive action from Governor Bollard to a 125 bp cut.All these factors point to a much busier day on the trading floor in Wellington today.
