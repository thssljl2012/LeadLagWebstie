SUNCORP Metway will push ahead with a formal sales process for its banking and wealth management arm following an approach for the businesses in recent days from three of the nation's biggest banks.The move represents a substantial reversal in policy for the Queensland bank and insurer, which has strongly resisted any carve-up of its operations since the Queensland Government engineered a three-way merger of a financial services house before its sharemarket listing 11 years ago.It is also acknowledgment by Suncorp that conditions in global funding markets are likely to remain tough for the forseeable future - particularly for banks with smaller balance sheets - which could restrict its ability to continue to expand its lending book.It is understood Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank and ANZ have made separate approaches to Suncorp since the middle of last week to sound out the finance house's interest in selling its banking and associated wealth management arm.Talks remain at an early stage and no pricing has yet been discussed. But Suncorp has decided to move to a formal sales process to test the value of the business. Analysts believe a sale could exceed $8 billion.The approaches underscore the wave of consolidation occurring in the banking sector as a result of the global financial crisis.Smaller banks, in particular, are coming under pressure given the freeze in wholesale funding markets. Other banks have also been assessing sales of assets to raise capital as part of their efforts to repair damaged balance sheets.St George Bank cited the global credit crunch as a key factor in its decision to accept a $17.5 billion offer from Westpac in May. 'With the closure of offshore credit markets, funding for Australian banks has become more challenging in the past few weeks,' Standard &amp;amp; Poor's credit analyst Mark Legge said.It is understood Commonwealth is one of the keenest to test Suncorp's willingness to sell, given the cashed-up bank has also been eyeing the $4 billion-plus BankWest retail franchise.However, the Commonwealth's chief executive, Ralph Norris, told analysts recently that he preferred to expand in Queensland rather than Western Australia.National Australia Bank is also very interested in Suncorp, given its desire to expand in fast-growing Queensland.Suncorp operates the nation's sixth biggest bank, has assets of nearly $75 billion and more than 210 branches, mostly in Queensland. It operates about 40 branches in NSW.Suncorp has been a heavy user of mortgage brokers to enlarge its national footprint and, more recently, has been lending aggressively to small and mid-sized developers of commercial property.In the last financial year the bank increased earnings 11.2 per cent to $633 million, based on revenue of $1.21 billion. But its holding of non-performing loans rose sharply.Annual earnings for Suncorp's wealth management arm dropped 9.3 per cent to $136 million.It has more than $24 billion in funds under management, although this also includes mandates from Suncorp's giant insurance business.
