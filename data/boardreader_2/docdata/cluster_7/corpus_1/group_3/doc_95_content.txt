It's always difficult to present news from Australia without federal politics being in the forefront.Kevin Rudd and his Labor Government show a 71% approval rating in Neilson opinion polls over the federal Liberal Party and it's newly-elected leader Malcolm Turnball.But the Labor party have been punched on the nose as far as last weekend's New South Wales state elections and those held in Canberra are concerned. These elections showed the biggest swing against a sitting federal government in state and capital territory elections since the last war with a 20% swing against Labor.The Federal Government are currently under fire from the opposition Liberal party for over-reacting against the world's credit crisis; Turnball is comparing this with the world's reaction after the terrorist attack on New York during 9/11 in 2001.This is the most ridiculous statement that anyone can make in politics, for there is no way the present crisis can be compared with the attack on the World Trade Centre.The trouble with Australian politics is the media are allowed to televise live sittings from Parliament House in Canberra and politicians from all parties know when to play up to the cameras.n Two weeks ago the Prime Minister was boasting that Australia's economy was in good shape and better than most to handle the current financial crisis hitting the rest of the world.Now the story has changed and it is being recognised that Australia is just as much at risk as the rest of the global economy and the impact this is having on Australia's leading mining stocks such as Rio Tinto and BHP-Billiton.Since the Reserve Bank reduced the national interest rate by a 1% about 10 days ago the major banks have shown signs of the jitters. On Friday the ANZ Banking Group announced a 0.2 percentage points slice in their standard variable rate followed today by the Australian National Bank dropping their standard variable rate by the same margin.The cut was announced as the Prime Minister went on national television to answer questions from everyday Australians about the global crisis.The Prime Minster defended his $10.4bn economic stimulus package would be followed next year by tax cuts and further infrastructure spending.National Australia Bank chief executive Ahmed Fahour said he hoped the Federal Government's package would stop the economic slide into recession.In response to these changes from the ANZ and NAB, a spokesman for the Commonwealth Bank which has a standard variable lending rate at present of 8.33%, has stated the bank would review its lending rate this week.There is little doubt other banks will follow the lead of the others in quick succession.Like most other countries involved in this turmoil, Australian investors have lost heavily and this includes many of the nation's superannution funds.Last week Ford Australia announced it was cutting a further 400 jobs from its Melbourne-based Broadmeadows factory. This brings the total this year to close on 1,500 jobs lost owing to the drop in new car sales.The future of the car manufacturing industry in Australia looks very uncertain and grim and there is likely to be more job cutting if the present trend continues.
