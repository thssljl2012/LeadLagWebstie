TAX PACKAGE: National leader John Key is announcing the party's tax cut in Auckland this afternoon.Related LinksSubscribe to ArchivestuffComment on this storyNational will deliver tax cuts worth $47 a week to workers on the average wage of $45,000 - most delivered in April 2009.Further cuts will be delivered in April 2010 and 2011. But those cuts include the $16 a week the average tax payer has received from Labour's October 1 tax package.By 2011, the difference between what workers on the average wage would have received from National's package, compared with Labour's three year package, would be $15 a week - $32 from Labour and $47 from National.National leader John Key is expected to confirm the figures when he delivers National's tax package at Auckland's North Harbour stadium shortly after midday today.Mr Key confirmed yesterday that the package had been pared back because of economic turmoil and it would have been irresponsible to go ahead with the package National originally envisaged.National is punting that by bringing the bulk of its tax cuts forward to April next year it will offer voters a quicker payback and also stimulate the economy at a time when it is slipping into a longer recession.Taxpayers are likely to receive a second boost from an expected interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank on or before October 23. That could be as high as 100 basis points after the Reserve Bank of Australia stunned the markets yesterday by dropping its official cash rate from 7 per cent to 6 per cent.The ANZ Bank in Australia almost immediately followed suit by cutting its floating rate.National's tax package comes after Treasury released a grim economic forecast on Monday, revealing a decade of deficits and ballooning government debt.What was in Labour's tax package?Labour unveiled a $10.6 billion, three stage tax cut package in this year's Budget.The first stage took effect on October 1, and delivers $12 to $28 a week. Workers on the average wage (about $47,000) get an extra $16 a week.Stage two kicks in on April 1, 2010, and is worth between $18 and $39 a week.The final cuts start a year later and will deliver an extra $22 to $55.The cuts comprised a mix of lowering the bottom rate and raising the thresholds at which all rates apply.From October 1 this year, the bottom rate decreased from 15 cents to 12.5 cents in the dollar and the earnings to which it applies rose from $9500 to $14,000 a year. The threshold for this rate increases to $17,500 on April 1, 2010, and $20,000 on April 1, 2011.The top rate of 39% was not altered, but the threshold increased from $60,000 to $70,000 on October 1, rising to $75,000 on April 1, 2010 and $80,000 the next year.Two Ticks National!!#1 Posted by Hadley  12:03 PM   Wednesday, 08 October 2008#2 Posted by travis bickle  12:04 PM   Wednesday, 08 October 2008GREAT!
