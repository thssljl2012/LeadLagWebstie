SYDNEY, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd reported a 19 percent fall in second-half cash profit compared with the first half, hurt by a sharp rise in provisions for bad debts. Australia's third-biggest lender said its cash net profit for the half year to Sept. 30 was A$1.36 billion ($919 million). Analysts had on average forecast ANZ's cash profit for the second half at A$1.494 billion. Cash earnings, effectively the core profit, excludes one-off items and non-cash accounting items and forms the basis for dividends payable to shareholders. ANZ shares have fallen 31.3 percent so far this year, slightly less than the 32.1 percent fall taken by the underlying S&amp;amp;P/ASX 200 index this year.
