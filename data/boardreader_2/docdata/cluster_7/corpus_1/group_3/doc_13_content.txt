SYDNEY, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia , the country's No. 2 lender by assets, has offered as much as A$3 billion ($2.4 billion) to troubled British bank HBOS for its Australian operation BankWest, the Australian Financial Review reported on Thursday. A Commonwealth Bank spokesman said the bank would not comment on the speculation. Without citing sources, the paper said the offer was below the level HBOS, which is the subject of a UK government-backed takeover offer from fellow British bank Lloyds TSB (nyse: LYG - news - people ), was willing to sell for. Media reports in August had said CBA may offer over A$6 billion for BankWest, but valuations since then have been hammered by a string of high profile bank collapses caused by the credit crisis. The Lloyds-HBOS tie-up was announced last month after a slump in HBOS' share price stirred fears the bank might fall victim to the credit crunch. HBOS is Britain's biggest mortgage lender. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (nyse: ANZ - news - people ) and National Australia Bank (nyse: NAB - news - people ) are also interested in BankWest but have not been as aggressive as CBA, the paper said. In the same report, the Financial Review also said that Australian insurer Suncorp-Metway Ltd had received a number of informal approaches from larger rivals, including CBA and ANZ. ANZ, Australia's third-largest lender, said it did not wish to comment on the BankWest or Suncorp-Metway reports, and Suncorp had no comment on the speculation. Suncorp in August posted a near halving in year profit for fiscal 2008, hit be the turbulence on global markets, and has seen its shares drop 43 percent so far this year.
