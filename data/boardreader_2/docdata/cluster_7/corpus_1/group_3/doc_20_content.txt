SUPER funds have shied away from offering the new first home saver accounts, citing high administrative costs and rules.These new accounts - proposed during last year's federal election campaign - became reality this week but have attracted little interest from banks and none at all from superannuation funds.The Government's consultation process ended more than four months ago, but by October 1 no super funds - technically called registered superannuation entity licensees - had been authorised to offer the accounts, according to the  website.Moreover, APRA lists just 25 Australian deposit-taking institutions (ADIs or banks) as offering these new accounts. Of the big banks, only ANZ and Commonwealth Bank are represented, with more than half of those listed credit unions. policy and research manager Andrew Barr said funds were lukewarm about the accounts because of the need to create a new legal entity or trust to invest the money, resulting in higher administration costs.'That was probably the killer from the funds' point of view, that they would have to set up a separate trust,' Mr Barr said. 'You're dealing with a dribble of money when you first set the thing up so it's very difficult to generate the revenue you need to run it.'Mr Barr said the issue of offering first home saver accounts among super funds had been overtaken by economic turmoil. 'If the whole economy is looking less rosy than it was a few months ago, many funds might think, 'Am I really going to have much take-up on this? Are people going to really be putting money away towards their own home?',' Mr Barr said.The accounts are designed to help first home buyers save enough for a deposit.The Government will pay 17per cent on deposits of up to $5000 each year. No withdrawals are possible for four years.
