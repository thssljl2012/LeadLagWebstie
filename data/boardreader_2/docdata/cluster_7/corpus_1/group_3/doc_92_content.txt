MIKE Smith is not shirking from ANZ's 23% earnings drop, with the chief executive saying he was prepared to take responsibility for the annual set of accounts even though problems had set in well before he joined the bank a little over a year ago.The disappointing result, tarnished by escalating provisions and growing expense pressure, only serves to confirm what some parts of the markets have suspected for years: ANZ is a good-time bank.ANZ rewards shareholders generously when credit growth is fast and lending losses are benign.But when the cycle turns, as it did in 2001 and early last decade, it is one of the first to be king-hit with souring loans  nearly always focused on its problematic institutional business.For his part, Smith is looking to break this cycle  a course his predecessor, John McFarlane, had started on before his tenure was up.After a string of stock-lending debacles this year, Smith is determined to overhaul the institutional business for good  a project he admitted will take as long as two years.Meanwhile, he has maintained his commitment to future-proof ANZ's earnings, with the expansion into fast-growing Asia  a region he knows well through his days running the vast Asian business of HSBC.Smith yesterday maintained his ambitious target to double the amount of earnings ANZ generates from Asia in the next five years, although he appeared to soften his commitment, saying the goal was now 'aspirational'.He said acquisitions remain on the agenda with global crisis bringing asset values to more realistic levels in Asia.However, analysts are convinced that the bank would use a dilutive capital raising to pay for any transaction.Despite the earnings drop, ANZ's final dividend of 74 a share was flat on last year.Shareholders can have some comfort knowing that Smith will err on the side of resisting any cuts to dividend through the down cycle, knowing the value of yield to Australian investors.Around the divisions, it was a familiar story. Earnings were again driven by the flagship Australian banking business, where profit grew 12% to $1.48 billion. New Zealand earnings fell 17% to $600 million, hurt by a sluggish economy and rising bad debt charges.Profit for ANZ's institutional business, home to the credit derivative trades, fell 65% to $526 million.ANZ's group-wide expenses disappointed analysts, growing 10% in the year, outstripping just 4% growth in revenue.This is in contrast to rivals such as National Australia Bank, where expenses fell as much as 2% in the year.Net interest margins, a measure of profitability, fell 18 basis points to 2.01%.
