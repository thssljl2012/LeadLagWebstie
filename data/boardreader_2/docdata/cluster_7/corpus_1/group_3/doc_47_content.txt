According to the company, the features of the new One direct high interest saver include unlimited transfers to and from a nominated linked account; no minimum or maximum balance; no fixed term; and interest calculated daily and paid monthly.Meg Bonighton, executive manager of One direct, said: 'The key difference between one direct's new high interest saver and other online savings accounts is our variable interest rate of 7.5% is not a promotional rate that will be reduced following a fixed introductory period. One direct's new high interest saver is about helping to meet the needs of these customers by providing simple, value-for-money banking products with competitive rates.'  One direct, a part of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, has launched its new high interest online savings account offering an interest rate of 7.50% with no honeymoon period or fees.
