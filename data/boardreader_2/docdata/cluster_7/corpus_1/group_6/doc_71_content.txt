spreads narrowed on   Thursday as Wall Street's gains overnight helped lift sentiment   but the deteriorating economies of China and South Korea   continued to worry investors.   Purchases by the chief executives of Bank of America   and JPMorgan Chase of some of their companies' stock and   Apple's forecast-beating profit helped calm investors,   who had been worried about more bank and other corporate   results. and   Asian shares eked out small gains on Thursday, reflecting a   slight improvement in the appetite for risk. "There is a bit of confidence toward banks after their   executives bought their shares, and on the corporate side, we   have a stronger-than-expected result from Apple. These factors   gave people a degree of confidence," said a credit analyst.   The Asia iTraxx investment-grade index   excluding Japan, a key measure of risk aversion, narrowed to   about 328 basis points from as high as 345 on Wednesday, a   trader said.   Credit spreads have widened by as much as 48 basis points in   the previous two sessions, as concerns about more bank failures   and rising fears of a prolonged global recession prompted   investors to flee from riskier assets.   Investors remain on the edge in the coming sessions after   Barclays Capital said that Freddie Mac, the No. 2   provider of home loans in the U.S., would need $26 billion in   fresh aid from the government, traders said.   Elsewhere, South Korea's five-year credit default swaps   (CDS) -- insurance-like contracts that protect   investors against defaults or restructuring -- widened to 381   basis points from as high as 355 on Wednesday on the gloomy   outlook for Asia's fourth-largest economy.   South Korea's economy shrank a seasonally adjusted 5.6   percent in the fourth quarter from the previous three months,   more than twice as much as economists had expected and marked   the second-biggest contraction ever.   With its economy on the brink of a recession, Seoul may be   prompted to introduce more stimulus measures including   additional rate cuts, economists said. The nation's central bank   has lowered rates by a total of 2.75 percentage points since   early October.   China's five-year CDS was steady at 215 basis   points, after Beijing announced the economy expanded at its   slowest pace in seven years in 2008 despite a series of rate   cuts and fiscal measures to support key industries.   China's gross domestic product rose 9.0 percent last year,   snapping five straight years of double-digit growth rates that   fuelled the economy's leap to become the third largest in the   world after the U.S. and Japan.   Asian economies, largely dependent on exports to support   growth, were crumbling as major markets overseas were mired in   recession.
