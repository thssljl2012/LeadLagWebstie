Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, released on Monday, showed housing finance for owner occupiers was up 1.4 per cent in November to $12.46 billion, on a seasonally-adjusted basis.  In October the federal government lifted the first home owners grant from $7,000 to $14,000 for established homes, and to $21,000 for newly-constructed houses.  But myriad government incentives were not enough to give confidence to the business sector.  Commercial finance plummeted 10.4 per cent to $28.4 billion, on a seasonally-adjusted basis.  Australians' appetite for personal credit also eased, down 1.8 per cent to $6.1 billion.
