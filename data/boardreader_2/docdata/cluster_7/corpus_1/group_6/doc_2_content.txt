* Australia central bank seen cutting rates 100 basis points  SYDNEY, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Australia's central bank is set to cut official interest rates to record lows next week as a near collapse in trade abroad and a vicious credit squeeze at home has the country teetering on the brink of recession.  A Reuters poll of 20 analysts on Friday found the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) was expected to cut its key cash rate by a bold 100 basis points to 3.25 percent when it meets on Feb. 3.  Such a move would bring its easing since September to 400 basis points, easily the most drastic on record, and leave the cash rate at the lowest since the central bank began to target it in the early 1990s. The last time overnight money market rates were this low was in 1960. And the cutting was unlikely to end there.  'Driven primarily by the raft of very poor global, and especially Asian data in recent weeks, we expect the RBA to deliver another bold 100 basis-point cut next week and wouldn't rule out a 125 basis points,' said Su-Lin Ong, a senior economist at RBC Capital Markets.  'Given the unfolding Asian recession the odds are that the cash rate moves towards a floor of 2.5 percent, and possibly 2 percent, sooner rather than later.'  Markets have been consistently ahead of analysts in expecting an aggressive easing and going by swap rates are fully priced for a 1 percentage point cut on Tuesday . Interbank futures  are also pricing in more drastic easing to an all-time low of 2.0 percent by June. The median forecast from analysts was for a bottom of 2.5 percent, down from 4.0 percent as recently as December.  Economists in recent days have been scrambling to catch up with the market by slashing their forecasts for rates, economic growth and inflation as data from around the world painted an unremittingly bleak picture.  In particular, dire figures from Australia's major trading partners -- China, Japan and South Korea -- posed a serious threat to both exports and business investment this year.  Domestic data this week showed consumer prices fell by the most in a decade last quarter and inflation was now expected to return to the RBA's 2 to 3 percent target band much earlier than previously expected.  Private sector credit also suffered its first monthly fall in 17 years in December, in part because foreign banks were cutting back on their lending to Australian companies.  'The fall in credit should start the alarm bells sounding in the RBA and the government,' said Joshua Williamson, a senior strategist at TD Securities.  'The data is a poor omen for GDP growth this quarter and a major worry for business investment,' he added. 'There should now be nothing in the way of the RBA delivering a large interest rate cut next Tuesday and signalling a desire to do more of the same at future meetings.'  The centre-left government is also doing its part to support the economy and is now widely expected to announce a second fiscal stimulus package next week, on top of A$10.4 billion in hand-outs delivered in December.  'The authorities will embrace a much more aggressive fiscal policy than previously expected and the stimulus will need to last longer than one year,' said Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac, after cutting his forecasts for growth and rates. --------------------------------------------------------------- Economists were asked where rates would be after the RBA's meeting on Feb. 3.
