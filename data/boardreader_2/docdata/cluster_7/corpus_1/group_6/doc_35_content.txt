It's the best of times and worst of times for Kiwis as interest rates come sliding down.  Borrowers, including those shut out of the house market for years, are rubbing their hands as lower mortgage payments beckon.  Porirua home owner Bria Hayward, whom The Dominion Post profiled yesterday, was stoked to see Reserve Bank governor Alan Bollard slash rates by more than expected. 'It's fine by me, it's great.' After paperwork problems stymied her and partner Justin McArthur's attempt to get a fixed mortgage last week, economists' predictions for further cuts have made her think again. 'I'm just going to wait. Anything's better than 8 per cent, but I've spoken to our [bank] manager and he's advising us to wait, so I think we're just going to stay on our floating rate.' Their bank, ASB, dropped the floating rate to 6.9 per cent yesterday. The couple had been paying about 7.45 per cent.  But the rate cut is not such good news for superannuitant Peter Redfearn, who has savings in a two-year bank deposit that earns about 8 per cent interest. Similar term rates offered yesterday hovered around the 4 per cent mark.  Though Mr Redfearn, of Seatoun, president of the Wellington South East branch of Grey Power, believed his deposits were big enough to see him through recession, he said he might have to cut back on his penchant for travel. 'You start getting into the bit of capital you've got and have to start thinking outside the square.' Despite the blow to his income, Mr Redfearn did not blame Dr Bollard for his move. 'I can't see any other realistic way of helping the economy. I suspect we're going to have to lump it.' Although rates were diving, he still planned to pull money out of investment companies and put them into banks soon, he said. He also thought he might spread his money around different banks that offered different options.
