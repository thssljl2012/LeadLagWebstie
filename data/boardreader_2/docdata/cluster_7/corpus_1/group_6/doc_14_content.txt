The question of how low New Zealand interest rates will go to stimulate the economy was answered by Westpac economists today with an estimate of 2.5 percent.  This is their prediction of the level the Official Cash Rate (OCR) will be cut to and doesn't mean mortgage interest rates will fall that far.  The OCR is currently 5 percent and floating mortgages rates are between 7.2 percent and 8.2 percent.  ANZ National Bank today cut its two-year fixed mortgage rate to 7 percent and its five-year rate to 7.10 percent.  Westpac is now predicting a 100 basis point, or full percent point, cut in the OCR when the Reserve Bank next announces its level on January 29. It was previously estimating a 50 basis point cut.  Westpac is 'pencilling in' another 100 basis point cut in March and 50 basis point in April, taking the OCR to 2.5 percent. This is lower than the 4 percent bottom in the OCR Westpac was previously predicting.  It was clear that the overall picture of the economy justified a much lower path for interest rates, Westpac said.  'Prospects for a second half recovery in growth this year look dim,' Westpac said.  The lower OCR will mean that term deposit rates will fall, reducing the income of those who live off investments in interest rate products.  There was a rush of bond sales in New Zealand late last year, which were popular with investors seeking to lock in interest rates before they fall more.  Brokers said are there are a number of issuers lining up to offer fixed rate paying instruments to the market, including some new issuers and banks.
