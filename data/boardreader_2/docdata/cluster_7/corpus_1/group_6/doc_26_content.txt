Long-term fixed mortgage rates have begun to fall further, with Westpac slicing up to 30 basis points off three to five-year rates.  The move brings Westpac into line with ASB Bank for four and five-year fixed terms at 7.1 percent and 6.99 per cent for the three-year rate.  Westpac has one of the lowest rates for the popular two-year fixed mortgage, at 6.85 percent.  Other banks said they were monitoring the situation. Westpac's head of product management, David Cunningham, said the bank was responding to falls in the cost of longer-term wholesale interest rates.  Those rates had come back in anticipation of the Reserve Bank cutting official interest rates later this month.  The official rate was cut by a record 1.5 percentage points to five percent last month. 'The wholesale markets are currently pricing an OCR reduction of 0.75 percentage points on January 29 and another 0.5 percentage points on March 12,' Mr Cunningham said. That would take the official rate to 3.75 percent, with some economists tipping it to go as low as 3.5 per cent by the middle of this year.  Floating and short-term fixed rates would become cheaper, but rates for two years and longer were now below their historical average levels, Mr Cunningham said.  He expected homeowners to increasingly want to lock in longer term fixed terms.  The two-year rate has averaged eight percent since 2002, well above the current level.  Banks were also under pressure to lower floating rates with the 90-day bill rates falling to 4.7 percent and calls from the Reserve Bank last month for banks to pass more of the savings on to borrowers.  Market sources have suggested that a new round of floating rate cuts could start next week.
