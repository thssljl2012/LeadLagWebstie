 - (Kyodo)-The U.S. dollar rose to around the 91 yen level Monday morning in Tokyo in response to some positive news about the U.S. financial sector late last week. At noon, the dollar fetched 90.97-91.02 yen, up from Friday's 5 p.m. quotes of 90.65-75 yen in New York and 90.29-32 yen in Tokyo.   The euro traded at $1.3343-3348 and 121.45-50 yen against late Friday's quotes of $1.3265-3275 and 120.15-25 yen in New York, and $1.3237-3240 and 119.54-58 yen in Tokyo.   After opening higher, the dollar fell slightly but moved narrowly in a range near the 91 yen line.   The dollar trended upward on the strength carried over from late last week, when anxiety about the ongoing global financial crisis eased somewhat as both Europe and the United States rushed to take steps aimed at keeping their economies afloat.   On Friday, the U.S. government decided to infuse an additional $20 billion in fresh capital into struggling Bank of America and Citigroup Inc. on a plan to keep its core business and rid itself of some operations in a desperate effort to shore itself up. 'Still, fears about the prospects of the U.S. financial industry run deep so some dollar selling for yen was observed,' said an analyst at a major trust bank.   On Monday morning, the Japanese government said it expects Japan's gross domestic product to show no growth in real terms in the year through March 2010 but the news apparently little affected the currency market, dealers said.   Trading volume could be light as the U.S. market is closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday, they added.
