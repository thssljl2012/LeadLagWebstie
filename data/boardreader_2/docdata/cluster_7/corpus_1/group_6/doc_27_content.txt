More gloom and pessimism was heaped upon the business community yesterday with the release of the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research's (NZIER) quarterly survey of business opinion.  The survey results were the weakest in nearly 40 years and although foreshadowed by the monthly National Bank survey, the NZIER survey has a longer pedigree.  The survey started in 1968 and the December quarter results were the weakest since 1970.  ASB Bank chief economist Nick Tuffley said when expectations of domestic trading activity hit their lowest level since 1970, and did so by a huge margin, this was a strong warning that New Zealand's recession might have intensified late last year or early this year.  The survey was conducted in December, giving some time for perspective to set in after the financial market panic in October.  Ninety-seven percent of responses arrived after the Reserve Bank's 1.5% cut in the official cash rate to 5%.  NZIER research economist Johannah Branson said the weak domestic economy provided scope for the Reserve Bank to further reduce its OCR this month.  The survey results pointed to a continued contraction in domestic trading activity along with easing pricing intentions, in the final quarter of last year.  Indicators of domestic trading activity suggested that real GDP declined again in December, implying negative economic growth for all of last year.  On a seasonally adjusted basis, a net 44% of firms reported a drop in their own activity in December, which was the worst result of that indicator since at least 1970.  A net 43% of firms reported they expected a drop in their own activity in the March 2009 quarter, again the worst result since at least 1970.  'Given the considerable uncertainty facing New Zealand businesses in the current economic environment, some volatility in this indicator is to be expected.  'That said, the sheer scale and sharpness of the deterioration is difficult to ignore,' Ms Branson said.
