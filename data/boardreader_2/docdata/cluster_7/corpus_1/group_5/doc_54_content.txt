The Australian dollar has opened weaker as the US government's multi-billion package for its car industry boosted support for the American currency.  At 7am, the Australian dollar was trading at 68.32 US cents, down from Friday's close of 68.58.  During the overnight session, the local unit traded between 67.67 US cents and 69.21.  The US government's $US17.4 billion ($25.46 billion) in emergency loans to American car makers allayed concerns of an industy collapse.  Two of the big Detroit carmarkers, General Motors and Chrysler, are expected to seek access to the money immediately.  Commonwealth Bank manager of institutional services foreign exchange, Tim Kelleher, said the US dollar rose after the announcement of the bail-out package for the American car industry.  'There was some Aussie/yen buying on the back of the automakers package going through,' he said from Auckland.  'Traders bought US dollar/yen and the Aussie/Yen went up a bit on the back of it.'  The US dollar rallied against the yen, after the Japanese central bank cut its key interest rate to 0.1%, from 0.3% on Friday afternoon.  The Bank of Japan's rate cut places its key funding rate near the US federal funds rate, after the US Federal Reserve lowered the rate banks lend to each other rate cut to a target range of zero to 0.25% last week.  Mr Kelleher said recent movements on foreign exchange markets had been exaggerated by low trading volumes.  'It was pretty volatile with wide ranges and thin markets,' he said.  'The currencies are quite thin in volume, so it is not taking as much to move them.'  Local data due for release on Monday include new motor vehicle sales for November, following a 0.5% fall in October, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.  Mr Kelleher said the Australian dollar should trade between 67.75 US cents and 68.75 during the Asian session.  'It should be a quieter day leading into Christmas,' he said.
