Article from: AAP  Font size: Decrease Increase  : Email  : Print  RESERVE Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Glenn Stevens has not ruled out cutting interest rates in January, a month when the RBA board does not normally meet.  When asked where he would be on the first Tuesday in January, the time of the month when the RBA meets in any other month, Mr Stevens said: 'I will not be at the office, but I won't be far from the office.  'No meeting has been scheduled for this time.  'In truth, the option is open in any month to do something intermeeting if there's a big event to cause it.  'The flow of data slows down in early January ... (but) I have their (RBA board members') phone numbers.'  The RBA governor said that Australian house prices were unlikely to decline by 30 to 40 per cent, as was the case in the United States.  'They've got serious overbuilding and we've got underbuilding,' Mr Stevens said.  'There are some quite serious questions why (Australian) house prices have to be so high in a country in this much land and so few people.'  'I think we can rest easy.'  Mr Stevens earlier told business economists at a dinner tonight that Australia could negotiate the difficult times ahead and that policymakers had scope to adjust macroeconomic settings further if needed.
