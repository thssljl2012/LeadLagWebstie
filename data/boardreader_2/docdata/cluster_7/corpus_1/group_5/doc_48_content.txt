The Australian dollar is higher after stronger commodity prices and further rallies on Wall Street lifted the currency towards $US0.6700.  Around midday, the dollar was trading at $US0.6615, up from Monday's close of $US0.6534.  The dollar opened stronger at $US0.6675, boosted by higher commodity prices and a rallying stock market during New York trading, but the unit soon hit resistance just below $US0.6700 and fell back towards $US0.6600.  Head of currency strategy at National Australia Bank, John Kyriakopoulos, said this morning's price action mirrored the currency's previous attempts to break above $US0.6700. 'You did have a decent rally and there would have been a bit of cautiousness because we haven't sustained moves above 66 US cents for some time now,'' Mr Kyriakopoulos said. 'We've had some moves above 66 US cents, but they haven't held.'' Mr Kyriakopoulos said the local currency reacted negatively to the latest NAB business survey, but moves were limited. 'I'm not saying that the currency is immune to bad news on the economy, it's just that there's an awful amount of bad news already priced in,'' he said. 'The market's already pricing in probably a good chance of recession in Australia.''  The survey found business confidence fell to a record low in November, while business conditions also continued to deteriorate.  While the actions of US and other governments had managed to offset the recent run of dire economic data and improve market sentiment, Mr Kyriakopoulos said he expected any Australian dollar rallies to be limited. 'It's hard to say that you're going to have another four to five US cent rally from here while the RBA (Reserve Bank of Australia) is still cutting rates,'' he said. 'There's still a lot of pessimism around about the global economy.''   Meanwhile, the Australian bond market was mixed at noon - stronger at the short end of the yield curve while long-dated notes were weaker.  The yield on the Commonwealth Government March 2019 bond was at 4.318%, up from Monday's close of 4.293%, while the yield on the June 2011 bond was at 3.500%, down from 3.533%.  On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the December 10-year bond futures contract price was at 95.690, down from Monday's close of 95.705, while the December three-year contract price was at 96.455, up from 96.425.
