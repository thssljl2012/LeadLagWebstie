The Australian dollar rose above $US0.6600 but its stay there was short-lived as investors continued to support the US dollar despite its struggling economy.  At 1700 AEDT, the Australian dollar was trading at $US0.6589/94, up from Tuesday's close of $US0.6558/61.  During the day, the local unit traded between a low of $US0.6558 and a high $US0.6643.  The Australian dollar traded just below $US0.6600 for most of the local session but managed to break through and reach its intraday high of $US0.6643 at about 1520 AEDT.  But that run quickly faltered and the unit was back below $US0.6600 by the local close.  Corporate risk manager at Custom House Global Foreign Exchange, Charles Wiggins, said expectations were that the Australian dollar should be trading between 67 and 68 US cents by Christmas.  But he said continued appetite for US dollar buying had kept the Australian dollar from reaching those levels.  'The US has always been seen as a safe haven, previously, but they are the ones that are in the economic strife, more so than any other country,' Mr Wiggins said.  'Yet, people are still going back to US dollars. To me, that doesn't make sense.'  Mr Wiggins said local data added to positive sentiment about the Australian dollar - there was a surprisingly strong rebound in consumer confidence in November, according to a Westpac survey of consumer sentiment.  'That was a little bit of a shock to the market, a little bit better than expectations, so we saw a bit of a rally there,' Mr Wiggins said.  Adding further to the upbeat mood was another positive day on equity markets and official statistics which showed the number of home loans for owner-occupied housing rose by 1.3 per cent in October, ending eight consecutive monthly declines.  Mr Wiggins said he expected moves to be limited ahead during Wednesday night's (AEDT) offshore session, with investors waiting for the November employment report, due for release at 1130 AEDT Thursday.  At 1600 AEDT, the Reserve Bank of Australia's trade weighted index was at 54.6, up from Tuesday's close of 54.5.
