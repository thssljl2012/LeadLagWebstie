  Westpac Banking, the countrys biggest financial company by market value, will cut the interest rates on its credit cards.   The bank cut the interest rate on its lowest interest Low rate credit card by 0.65 percentage points to 11.99 per cent.  The rate on its Business Choice Everyday card was cut to 0.8 percentage points to 13.39 per cent.   The biggest cut was made to the Virgin credit card, as Westpac reduced that rate by 1.25 percentage points to 12.99 per cent.  Westpac said it had cut the rates on some cards by as much as 1.75 percentage points.  There have been calls for the banks to reduce their credit card interest rates as the Reserve Bank of Australia has cut its overnight cash rate by three percentage points since September to 4.25 per cent from its peak of 7.25 per cent.  Last week, Treasurer Wayne Swan said the government wanted to see the banks reduce their credit card rates more, in response to the cuts by the RBA.  Westpacs interest rate reductions will come into effect on Monday, December 15.
